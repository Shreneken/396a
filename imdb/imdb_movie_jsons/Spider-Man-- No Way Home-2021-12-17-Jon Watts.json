{"rating": 8.2, "release_date": "2021-12-17", "num_reviews": 6115, "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Fantasy"], "summary": null, "Loved every second": "This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman. I loved every second of it!", "Great concept, mediocre execution": "A tough one to rate. It certainly has entertainment value, but it's frustrating that it could have been so much better. On the one hand, the concept of bringing villains and other Spidermen in from alternate universes is fantastic, and it was great to see some of these characters again. There is so much star power in the cast here, and the special effects are wonderful.On the other hand, there is quite a bit of bloat as well. I'm all for character development and non-action scenes in action movies, but too often these moments were poorly written and bogged the film down. I have to say, I didn't care for how na\u00efve Tom Holland's version of Spider-Man was either, and I could never buy in to the concept that he would try to \"fix\" the villains before sending them back to their own universes. This seemed asinine to me, and how that would stop them from dying where they came from was a mystery too. There are several other plot elements that are either weakly crafted (Dr. Strange getting trapped by some quick Spidey-math) or boring (Peter Parker and his friends and their college admission drama, good grief). Give me more of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), less of Ned Leeds, the goofy sidekick.", "Phenomenal conclusion": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is a phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy and Holland's best outing as Spidey yet. Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again, reliably charming and likeable but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.Jon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again but refreshingly impactful this time around. There's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous imagery.It's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long due to a strong momentum established early on. The CG is extremely impressive with only a few weak spots.The music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous iterations and use of Holland's iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work as well as a few new additions that are beautifully epic.", "I consider myself to be a big fan of Marvel and definitely of Spider-Man, but something wasn't right about this film": "Awful movie. The plot sucked and had awful pacing humour, and dialogue were subpar(like the octopus joke). And they couldn't think of anything better so they brought back some old characters which still didn't save this poorly written film. One bad dialogue scene was when the 3 Spider-Men where making jokes about Tobey's organic webs which was just awkward and humorless. And to add to that, Tobey saying that \"my back\" joke and Norman Osborn repeating \"I'm something of a scientist myself\". Just why?! The film could never decide whether it's a comedy or a dark action movie.This movie certifies that Tom Holland is the worst Spider-Man. With great power comes great responsibility and MCU Spider-Man lacks that. He's had 6 movies and still acts like an inexperienced, immature, not independent, not smart and acts like a rookie. And the whole plot started because he couldn't think of an alternative to get him and his friends to college so he got Doctor Strange to go and make a spell so that everyone will forget that Peter is Spider-Man(also doing it without his friends consent). And of course with Peter being the doofus he is, he messes up the spell which causes the multiverse to collide. There's a reason why his messes are always cleaned up by someone better than him. One of Spider-Man's best traits is his quick thinking and it was so inevitable that after messing up the spell, he decides to go and talk to the headteacher of the college for a placement(same scene where Doctor Octopus appears). You'd think he would have learnt his lesson about trusting villains in Far From Home but no; he does it again which caused Aunt May's death. It could have been avoided if he had just sent them home, but no they needed to be \"cured\"(which is odd because The Lizard was cured in the Amazing Spider-Man). It just made him look sappy and too Disney like, thinking he can change their fate. It's also not smart to invite dangerous villains into your house with a non superhero family member there. How could he trust them that quickly? When you see it, you find it hard to feel bad for Peter because you're like \"yeah this guy sucks\" The emotional scenes in this movie were pretty awful, especially how long and stretched May's death was and they still tried to exchange jokes and had her standing up right before dying(also re wording Uncle Ben's infamous line which sounded wrong). Family member deaths are always before the character becomes a hero so doing it after feels cheap. It wasn't even basic superhero bad luck, just Spider-Man not thinking straight.Marvel really need new writers(especially in the comedic department), because they've released 4 bad movies this year and a TV show that messed up a timeline just like No Way Home did. And they've also ruined Spider-Man's character by not properly developing him and just throwing him into the Avengers drama. They are cash grabbers and only adding him because he is popular and it will get the movie ticket sales up. No Way Home is one of the few movies that make me wish the villains had won, and the reason is that the plot armour on Spider-Man was too strong. Like when geometry was somehow the answer to get out of the mirror dimension. Green Goblin was right about his morality getting the better of him.Overall this movie was just an overhyped, over budgeted nostalgia bait and Spider-Man is the real antagonist of this film. Always puts people in danger for no reason.", "Nonsense And Nostalgia": "Review By Kamal KI don't think this film was written well. It had already established Spider-man characters with no involvement with Stark, but still failed at making Tom's Peter any better than he was when under Tony Stark's mentorship. This movie was not good. No amount of nostalgia saved it for me. It had pacing issues, for example the movie skimmed past Peter's whole identity exposed moment and chucked Daredevil in for a meaningless cameo as nobody seemed to truly care that as a blind man, he was able to catch a brick chucked through the window. He was literally just there for fanservice, and not a well written one. The rest of the movie is pointless as by the end, they just reverse everything by sending the spider-men and villains back to their world, after of course, seemingly retconning the plots of the previous spider-man movies by curing the villains, who were taken before they met their demise. Therefore their fights with spider-man end on a lame note as they all just become ordinary men towards the end of the original battles and so the Peter Parkers wouldn't experience the key character development and progression of their stories from this.And in usual MCU fashion, the film is riddled with jokes that sometimes hit, but mostly fall flat. Awful humour, which is constantly blurted out after (or during) serious moments because the writers simply couldn't leave us without jokes for two whole minutes. Constant tonal shifts because of the \"jokes\", And the Peters just felt like they needed to be there for Tom's Peter? Bad writing at its finest.Yes, this whole movie could've been avoided if Peter just listened to Doctor Strange, a man who actually knows magic and the consequences of messing spells up, but nope, he has to be stupid when he is supposed to be smart. Strange was literally the best character in the entire film, just for being the only one with a working braincell.Overall, I found this movie quite bad. Nothing about it made me want to rewatch it and I have been feeling this with MCU movies recently like Black Widow and Shang chi, I will continue to watch Spider-man movies just because of my love for the character, but I will most likely continue to think the MCU's portrayal of the character is the worst even though Tom Holland's acting is great.", "Somehow better than Endgame": "Greetings from Lithuania.I wasn't the biggest fan of previous two movies. I felt they were to independent and carried the weight of Avengers. Yet they were fun entertainment. But this instalment called \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" (2021) was best of the three. If you are a fan of Spider Man in general - go see this on the biggest screen possible, and i will say it no more.", "Just Awesome !": "It was very enjoyable to watch in the cinema. The expected theories turned out to be true. Acting was great. The script was pretty good. I will watch it for the second time) It was the best Spiderman movie in my opinion. It's also one of the best Marvel movies. Be sure to watch it in the cinema!", "SUPERHERO EXTRAVAGANZA!!!": "Superhero extravaganza! Spider-Man NWH didn't meet my expectations, it exceeded them. The most emotionally resonant MCU film so far. This movie is worth every excruciating moment we had to wait. The visuals, the score, the emotions, the story, and ofc the fan-service. This film understands spider-man fans like no other spider-man film before it. Truly a celebration of the most beloved character in the best way possible!", "Definitely one for the fans...": "Right, well I am by no means a fan of superhero movies, but I will watch them when given the chance. Why? Solely for entertainment purposes, because Marvel Studios does make rather impressive movies, now don't they? Indeed. And that is also why I opted to sit down and watch the 2021 movie \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" here in 2022.Actually, my family went to watch \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" back in 2021 when it was out in the cinema, but I didn't go, as I don't think superhero movies are worth the ticket admission for a cinema. So instead, I opted to watch it when it became readily accessible at the comforts of my home.Writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers actually put together a wholesome enough storyline here for this movie, and sure it was watchable and enjoyable. Outstanding or memorable? No, not so much. But then again, I am not overly keen on the whole superhero genre. But \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" did provide me with entertainment for the 148 minutes that the movie ran for.And it was actually fun enough to watch the various Spider-Men come together on the screen and fight the villains from previous movies all over again. Nostalgia? Perhaps. But at the same time, sort of lazy writing when you think about it.Visually then \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" was phenomenal. But then again, that is what Marvel Studios excel at, isn't it?\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" certainly has a impressive cast list, with a lot of big names. I mean, you have Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire as the Spider-Man, and then you have Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church return to reprise their former villainous roles. And the movie also have the likes of talents such as J. K. Simmons, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau and such on the cast list as well.It was nice, though, to see that the writers were taking the many previous movies in the franchise with a grain of salt some times throughout the course of the movie, with the puns and snazzy dialogue hinting at and referencing previous movies.\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" definitely is a pleasing movie for the fans of superhero movies and of \"Spider-Man\" in general.My rating of \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" lands on a six out of ten stars.", "A franchise in decline, and this meta nonsense doesn't help": "I was already concerned about Spider-Man: No Way Home when I walked into the theater (one could say I was expecting to be disappointed.) I kind of hate the idea of delving too deep into a multiverse, because I think it muddles things too much, and defies the internal logic of most stories. Sure enough that was something I felt while watching this film. This movie cannot hold up to even the tiniest bit of analysis, because it creates plot holes that you can drive a freight train through. It's kind of sad because there were some moments in the movie that I genuinely loved, but all I can think about days later are the myriad of questions that I'm left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense.My other big problem with Spider-Man: No Way Home is not really a fault of the movie, but more of the society we live in today. Living in an internet-focused culture, we are bombarded by ads and news stories that relate to the things that interest us. SInce I've shown my love for all things MCU in the past, of course I see plenty of things crossing my radar about the upcoming films. I was able to avoid watching any trailers for this movie, which I thought would help, but by merely catching headlines of casting rumors I could foresee every surprise they built into it. Of course any logical mind could put two and two together once the guest appearances start, so I suppose this isn't a movie that is going to blow away audiences with its surprises.As I said, though, my disappointment is quite frustrating because I also found many aspects of No Way Home so satisfying. They wrapped up some story elements nicely, and this might have contained some of the best acting in any Marvel movie. In particular, I found Zendaya so surprisingly strong, I was almost able to ignore her lack of character motivation in some key moments. She wasn't the only person in the film that behaved stupidly, in fact the central premise of the film is built on a horrible idea from Aunt May that seems altruistic, but lacks any 4th-dimensional thinking which I would expect from a genius like Peter Parker. But smart people being dumb is the catalyst of the entire story, as even Dr. Strange doesn't seem to think anything through, past Peter's initial request.No Way Home is easily the most meta Spider-Man movie ever made, which is kind of shocking to say in a post \"Into the Spider-verse\" world. It's catering to the most die-hard fans in the world, but it's more of a nod to the fans of the Spider-Man movies. I was always a huge fan of the multitude of Spider-Man comic books when I was a collector, but I've typically struggled with his portrayal in films. So, giving all these nods to things that came before Tom Holland took over the role on the big screen, falls a bit flat for me. One of the things I loved about this iteration of the character is that it avoided the cliches and saved us so much of the traditional Spider-Man origin story, but this movie back-pedaled and became a copy of a copy of a copy.This return to cliche also sucked some of the emotion out of key moments as any fan of the character should know the same old tropes by now. I almost got emotional at the end because of the great acting performances, but the big emotional moment earlier in the film did nothing for me as all I could think was \"really, we're going there?\" There are some good laughs in the film, although I wonder how well it will hold up on rewatch. And I will rewatch this film, as I do with all MCU movies, but I think at this point Spider-Man: No Way Home sits as my least favorite in the franchise. In fact, I'm at a point right now where I'm questioning if I will keep being a diehard fan of everything the MCU churns out. This film wasn't what I'd call a complete failure, but I'm concerned the MCU is getting closer to one of those. Perhaps EndGame should have been exactly what the title implies.", "A MASSIVE treat for every Spidey fan out there.": "This is a movie made purely to satisfy the fans and there should be no doubt about that. No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland. The visual effects too were top notch and the editing was stupendous. Two and a half hours flew by real quick while watching this popcorn action entertainer. It won't be fair to reveal anything, so here I conclude my review, and recommend you to check out this new world of Spidey-ness on the big screen and in 3D. And once you've seen it, please don't spoil it for others, just like you won't want it spoiled for yourself.", "Dull, Bland And Dumb": "It most likely Sony has to continue to soft re-boot this exhausting tedious story in order for them to maintain rights. In this case, it throws the entire kitchen sink including nods to the multiverse.In this one Peter Parker rues the day people discover he is Spiderman. And in order to allow his friends to live a normal life he goes to Dr. Strange to conjure up a spell so he would be forgotten. Seriously. The entire movie is predicated on a stupid wish. Well obviously that goes wrong and a dimension portal opens to different worlds where villains dont recognize the present casted Peter Parker. Seems clever on paper but it is a slog. The only gimmick is that we see Peter Parkers from previous flicks. What you get are momentum killing conversations between the Spideys. Which, for fans, suppose it's great to shoehorn legacy. For people who are too young to know anyone of the previous ones. Im sure theyll be confused.This entire movie moves at a snails pace and suffers from bloat. You can slash a half hour and still be fine. This culminates in the death of Aunt May. Because, if you follow the storylines Spidermans have to have a loved one die at their own stupid decisions. When will that end?I suspected this would be the typical messy CGI garbage. And it didnt disappoint. It is greenscreen heaven.There is a better story here. This one felt unnecessary.", "A Movie For Children": "It took me a while to get around to watching No Way Home. There was so much hype, and people were declaring 'the hype is real.'I feel alone on an island thinking this movie is terrible. I get that people were psyched about all the old Spider-Man characters coming together for a big super fun time, but that does not cover up for how nonsensical everything is in this film. (Spoilers incoming)First the good. This will be a short segment. The idea to bring all the characters from the previous Spider-Man movies together through the multiverse is an awesome concept. The execution however was lazily conceived.The two constant problems in the movie are the cringey dialogue and the incomprehensible decision making. The movie starts with Peter Parker's identity being revealed. Now if your identity is revealed where is the last place you want to go? The answer is your house. It appears no one told the writers this because that is where Parker goes. Also, Parker ask's Strange to put a spell on the world so his friends can go to MIT? How is that his rationale? Yes it gives purpose for the rest of the film but it's a lazy story telling way to get there. Why would Dr. Strange agree at all to that. He is a freaking wizard.There is not a single line of dialogue that is intelligent. It's all cliches, lines that have been in previous movies, or just pop culture language with no substance. Towards the end I was cringing at the back and forth between characters, especially when Goblin says \"I'm something of a scientist myself.\" Yes we know that when you said it 20 years ago. (I loathe fan service.) There were a couple jokes that landed but overall I was laughing at parts that weren't supposed to be funny, like when all the Peter Parkers were in the lab with their goggles and test-tubes finding cures for the villains in less than 5 minutes. Again, lazy writing.This is a movie for children who have no concept of reality or care about a well thought out story. (End rant.)", "They did it! A Spider-Man trilogy finally stuck the landing!": "They did it! A Spider-Man trilogy finally stuck the landing! Spider-Man: No Way Home is an impressive culmination of the films that came before it, with an engaging storyline, exciting action, laugh out loud moments, and dramatic consequences. The beginning climb is a little slow, but it's an exhilarating ride once things get swinging. I don't exactly know how this movie will hold up after multiple viewings, as there are some plot points that don't quite make sense when you start to think about them, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself this first time.", "Idiotic childish movie": "I really do NOT understand the high score for this movie.The storyline is idiotic and childish with monsters and spider-men coming from different dimensions all because some spell from dr. Strange went bad.My God, what a piece of crap this movie...\nThe special effects are as expected great but the rest is really a bunch of nonsense!I love Spider-man, Batman, the Hulk etc but this movie is really terrible and I wasted 148minutes precious time.Take my word for it: the best thing to do is to skip this movie and wait for something better to watch, which is not hard as there are not many movies as dumb as this one!", "Homeless and restless": "There is so much to unpack here. And I understand that some people may not be into the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but it is apparent how much almost everyone loves this movie. And as you can tell I am one of them. Now you could dismiss my opinion, since I have clearly bought and swallowed the MCU pill (I openly admit liking and being a fan boy of what has been created there - you can hate me or simply agree with me, all opinions are welcome) ... but I dare anyone who has seen all Spider Man movies, not to feel at least something rather positive about this.It does take many good things from previous efforts (no pun intended) and gets the best out of them. It does a great service to the (movie) history of Spider-Man. But also showing us a different side of a Marvel hero ... a side that is vulnerable in a way we have not seen yet. Or not in that form - the identity crisis and the good deeds that do not go unpunished ... or do they? Tom Holland has been exposed - something you know if you've seen the previous Spider-Man movie ... and while his mentor Iron Man dealt differently with that fame - recognition, Peter Parker as we know him, can not deal with it the same way.Add to that, that he wants to help people as much as he can (a bit of a difference to what Tony Stark stood for most of the time, being self centered and and self serving) - and you have a dangerous combination. There is a reason the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies are being compared with 80s teen comedies - there are many parallels (John Hughes and others are being name dropped in those conversations). And while there is a lot of action (the mirror world scene has so many \"climactic\" scenes I probably did not close my mouth the entire time it was happening), the movie also takes its time to give us little character moments.And a lot of fan service - this movie celebrates what came before. It celebrates and takes its audience seriously. But in a fun and entertaining way. Yes it is not all fun and games and there are a lot of callbacks (no pun intended) - there is drama, there may be even some head shaking at how naive Peter Parker seems ... but it makes sense in the realm of the world that was built around him and the character that he is - there is an evolution, but he can't help himself - being who he is and who he grew up to be. For better or worse ... yes the famous line will be uttered and it will have a sad undertone to it. But the movie is able to give you so much, that even when you know something completely horrible is about to happen, you also know that some lighter moments will follow.That being said, it takes nothing away from the performance by Tom Holland, who has to play vulnerable, playful, ecstatic, experimental, shy and giving/helpful ... while a lot has been made of who is going to be in the movie (or not) - it is his movie. Yes there are many things that you can tear apart and make fun of - there are logic issues if you want to call them that ... but in a world where \"magic\" exists ... are you really going to nitpick? Maybe you will, which would be a shame - because you'll be missing out on one hell of a movie and a ride that is truly amazing - no pun intended.It is also amazing that Sony and Disney reached a deal - so that Marvel can continue to use Spiderman in their universe. But not just him ... it seems there is way more to come. And while having many throwbacks (and callbacks) and bringing them all to a conclusion of sorts ... well while all that could mean that this could be a nice way to end Tom Hollands reign as Spider-Man ... it could just as easily continue. The possibilities are endless going forward.As you can tell I am not one to spoil or say anything that is revealing. That is why I did not talk about the cast and the cameos - most of them were revealed ahead of time. Either officially (villains) or just through rumors (no matter how much denying went on - we knew ... we just knew) ... but there was a cameo that most did not see coming - pun very much intended.If you watched this in a cinema (which I can only highly recommend to do), you will probably still have goosebumps. You either cheered yourself loudly at quite a few moments (or gasped at others) ... or just enjoyed silently ... what a movie experience that was. One that I might repeat in cinemas - a treat I do not give myself too often, because I tend to let a bit of time pass before I rewatch something after the first time viewing ... but there are exceptions and this might very well be one of them ... Spider-Man you Sir ... are one of the good ones! Pun again intended - because you too are amazing ...", "Wow!": "The is so dump, asking strange to cast a spell on the whole planet so that he and his friends can get into mit.

Because he's so good inside? There are infinite villains and Spider-Man so this motivation is weak and frustratingly illogical.Plus they stuff up a magic spell and no one thinks to go find Wanda?

You've been warned.", "A good, not great movie.": "This is the best film Marvel has released this year. Shang-Chi was only ok, the Venom sequel was atrocious, Black Widow was so-so, Eternals was bland for the most part. What makes this one work is the cast, but the story really, when examined is weak. The last movie put the writers in a corner while revealing (a silly idea really) Peter's identity to the world. He goes to Doctor Strange without thinking about what he really wants, and ends up, in typical spider-man fashion, in screwing everything up. So, also in usual Spider-Man style, by trying to fix things up, he totally messes up further. In the end this costs him a lot. While this movie starts out well, the middle is dull and why should Peter care about beings from alternate realities? And by 'fixing' them, did he erase the events of those films, making the spider-men of those realities unnecessary? Peter loses everything due to his listening to Aunt May, who's advice is illogical and gets her killed. Well, I can say this was the best of Holland's trilogy, but it still isn't Spider-Man 2. A few sides: Molina, Garfield and Maguire's returns were the best part of this movie. Those three steal every single scene they're in. Dafoe was good as Norman, but I could have done without Electro and Sandman who added little to the story.

What it does deliver is plenty of spectacle. But a great film needs more than that. The story also moves along with some pace. But emotional impact should never be sacrificed for expediency. In short, this is an enjoyable film, but there have been better Marvel films.There is one scene that stands above the rest. And it is guaranteed to bring a smile to the lips of any Marvel fan. It has so much subtext and it is so unexpected.It ends with a tee-up for the next chapter, of course. I just hope that one focuses more on the characters and less on the effects. It certainly has that possibility, given where this episode ends.", "A memorable, passionate, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.": "If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)\"Spider-Man: No Way Home is one of the darkest, saddest, emotionally draining entries in the MCU, surpassing all of my expectations.Despite a messy, convoluted first half with some pacing issues and occasionally frustrating, poorly placed humor, Jon Watts, Chris McKenna, and Erik Sommers more than compensate these minor issues with some of the best (and brutally violent) Spider-Man action ever witnessed on screen.In addition to this, the surprisingly coherent narrative packs shocking developments and actually offers enough screentime for the villains to significantly impact Peter Parker's arc. Unbelievably outstanding performances from everyone involved, especially Tom Holland, Zendaya, and Willem Dafoe.A heartfelt, nostalgic homage to the Spider-Man legacy that fans will rewatch countless times, laughing and crying along for many more years to come.A memorable, passionate, once-in-a-lifetime cinematic experience.\"Rating: A.", "Quite brilliant": "If you thought the Marvel Universe had reached it's climax with Avengers Endgame, then think again, this was superb, and far more entertaining than any other Spiderman movie. Very cleverly done, mixing laughs and tears. If this is the way phase 4 is going to go then bring it on. This is the reason you go to the cinema, wonderful entertainment.", "Another fake rate action film! Full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Not recommended!": "This film start with the news broadcasting about Peter Parker is Spider-Man, and Spider-Man swinging his girlfriend \"MJ\" away with him scene! As turnout, this film is about Peter Parker need to restore peace in his world, after accidentally transported all the villains in other Spider-Man universe into his universe! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the walking scene, overuse of the arguing scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the transporting scene, overuse of the experiment scene, overuse of the searching scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the talking on the phone scene, overuse of the news broadcasting on the TV scene, overuse of the changing camera angle scene, and overuse of the kissing scene! Make the film unwatchable! All the action scene have things broken, and explosion at certain point, but overall portray by long angle, messy, and have slow motion! Make the film frustrated to watch! At the end, after the multiverse been restored, no people remember Peter Parker is Spider-Man! Spider-Man swinging back to his city at the very end! Still have two post credit scene! First one, Brock talking about Hulk with a bartender! Second one, the trailer of the next Doctor Strange sequel! That's it! Another disappointed film!", "An Epic Film That Really Delivers": "Finally, the biggest film Spider-Man: No Way Home has hit cinemas and I had to go see it as early as possible. Now I have watched it, here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Spider-Man's secret identity revealed, he tries to get Doctor Strange's help to fix things but this leads to some unwanted visitors from other universes to cause problems for both of them.Main Character\nTom Holland has played Spider-Man for a while now and for me this is his best performance in the role. You really see how he has grown and this film shows real depth to the character and how he has kind of grown up into this crazy world. He doesn't have much rest in the film and it really pushes Holland to impress in the majority of his scenes and I thought he was great in really making Spider-Man a top hero in The MCU.Supporting Characters\nZendaya plays MJ and I was just really happy to see the dynamic between her and Peter in this film. Despite everything that goes on they are a pretty strong couple and it is just nice for a comic book film to have a relationship that feels natural without overpowering the main plot. Benedict Cumberbatch reprises his role as Doctor Strange and he is really good, I really like how despite being a hero he has a more mature and different viewpoint to Spider-Man. He adds some really interesting parts to the film and plays a unique role in the progress of the story and Spider-Man as a character. Jacob Batalon is back as Ned and he is much better then the role he played in Far From Home. He is just a fun character that supports Peter, he is way more involved with Spider-Man and that improves his character so much. Marisa Tomei is back as Aunt May and again she is more involved this time out and is just a really great person for Holland to bounce off and the dynamic just really works and makes their relationship feel very real. Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx reprise their roles as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Electro. Dafoe and Molina are great and really flourish in their roles, but the surprise is Foxx as Max Dillon/Electro. He is so much better then he was in Amazing Spider-Man 2 and I am glad he got given this 2nd chance here.Story\nThe story is really great, I was worried with all of the multiverse elements that the focus could have been taken off of a character arc for Spider-Man but it nails this element. Peter has a real arc and it develops incredibly well and for me was a real highlight. It is obviously great seeing the returning villains and they are treated with respect and their characters are further explored. The ending feels deserved and because you are so invested it feels really earnt.Script\nMCU films often get criticised for their scripts including too much humour in them, but I actually think the balance is really handled well here. Yes there are funny moments here but for me they didn't outweigh the serious and darker parts of the film.Style\nThe film looks great, the actions scenes are all really fun and seeing The MCU Spider-Man going against villains from the other franchises works very well and allows for some fun sequences. The pacing for the film is also really good, despite being 2 hours 30 mins it never felt too long and I honestly believe that there isn't really any filler here which is an impressive feat.Overall\nOverall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic film that really lives up to the hype. I am possibly still buzzing because I have just watched the film but I can't find too much fault and this is a Spider-Man fans dream film and anybody will find this film plenty of fun.Rating - 10/10.", "Generic MCU product but this time they ruined characters from past films as well.": "Well... at least it made me appreciate the Sam Raimi movies a bit more.Every character from past movies is done badly (in the case of the Raimi characters) or even worse (since The Amazing Spider-Man was terrible to begin with). They try to give Hollands Spider-Man a bit more development and growth but too little, too late.Utter garbage. Typical of Hollywood and the MCU.", "Super holiday entertainment loaded with visual and spiritual meaning.": "Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to Peter (Tom Holland): \"The problem is you trying to live two different lives. The longer you do it, the more dangerous it becomes!\"Notwithstanding the \"home\" in the title, the exciting new Spider-Man: No Way Home is more about the existential need to create one's own identity, the Christian need to give up a life in order to gain it, and the human need for a second chance. Many super-hero movies continue to emphasize the hero's need to recover a parent or child even more than the need to sacrifice for the good of humankind.As Peter Parker (Tom Holland) struggles with the attention he gets because Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) revealed his identity, he gets involved with Dr. Strange to erase his super-hero identity from everyone's memory. Fooling with Mother Nature never is good in these hyper-active fantasies, and it's true as Peter tries to get Dr. Strange to reverse his initial memory-erasing spell in order to remain in the minds of those he loves.Besides, what director Jon Watts and his writers are really interested in is pulling the three Spidies together (Holland, Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire) to remediate former bad boys like The Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church), Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), Electro (Jamie Foxx), and Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). Dr. Strange clears the way between parallel dimensions to let each Spidey's version of villains to come together for their cleansing.The imaginative and entertaining concept of getting these characters together proves not to be confusing but revealing of their generous natures and the benign fraternity of Spider-Men, adding the collaboration motif into their otherwise solitary lives.Although the digital gymnastics are impressive, beyond those is an attempt to flesh out character for both good and bad boys. Discoveries abound without super sentimentality or long exposition. Because the filmmakers have taken care to load meaning into most dialogue, the revealing third act takes the plot to dizzying heights while character spills out along the way.As more is found out about the heroes and the villains, the long road back to normalcy for Peter seems just about right, filled as it is with triumphs that come from working as a team (not a normal Spidey thing to do) to suffering the loss of dear ones to a better cause. It's a coming of age at any age and a satisfying display of character development that might be envied by indie films everywhere whose bread and butter is a similar attempt to show humans at their worst and best.Super holiday fare, yes; challenging, yes; amazed I am that comic-book stuff holds meaning amidst its visual splendor, yes.", "Sincerely Disappointing and Objectively Pointless": "When Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire enter the movie, the cinema rightfully erupts into a hail of cheers and applause. The experience of Spider-Man: No Way Home is bizarre. Not only do you spend half the runtime just waiting for the return of a familiar face, but grow weary of the current cast which've headlined the previous MCU entires. Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon cannot hope to carry a film on its own terms, therefore No Way Home relies and depends on the presence of legacy. Far From Home (2019) was borderline unwatchable. Cheap-looking, tone-deaf and accompanied by a forced, cringeworthy romance (which doesn't improve here by the way) it is surely the worst Spider-Man movie of all time. This threequel holds the unfortunate title of runner-up. It shares many of the same problems...First of all; technicalities. As with most MCU movies, the cinematography is flat and the colour palette is dulled for no apparent reason. The action set-pieces aren't very inventive and hold no iconography, always taking place on a boring, painfully obvious green-screened environment. Why does the Statue of Liberty look like that!? Why has the Lizard's design regressed from 2012, and why do they recycle and super-impose B-Roll footage of Thomas Hayden Church as Sandman, or Rhys Ifans as Curt Conners? It's so lazy.Aunt May's death barely affects me emotionally, because thus far she's been portrayed as this bubbly, whimsical character with very few scenes of actual conviction. Can you imagine if this was Rosemary Harris or Sally Fields' Aunt May? The difference in my reaction would be night and day. Moral of the story, don't cast the most gorgeous woman alive as Aunt May... Speaking of conviction, why does this film feel the need to inject a cheap gag whenever it's in proximity to a remotely serious scene? These screenwriters have to go back to basics, and refresh themselves on the fundamentals of tone. Not to mention, most of the MCU's humour so infrequently lands, and caters to the lowest common denominator audiences. That's not to say there aren't a few smart quips here or there, but for the most part, I was confused by the amount of chuckles surrounding me.No Way Home is, clinically, a bad movie. Take for instance, the First Act. Much of the world wants Spider-Man hunted down and defeated. He's interrogated once, and then freed on behalf of a pointless cameo by Daredevil himself, Matthew Murdock. Like, what? There's no ramifications. He just gets to live his life despite being an enemy of the state. Does the world think he partook in a terrorist plot or do they think he snatched a candy from a convenience store? I'm a little confused. I guess the consequence is that Ned and MJ don't get into MIT... Big deal. I don't care. These are poorly written characters. Bring on the multiverse villains!What can I say on that front..? I was grinning from ear-to-ear in seeing Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina), Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and Electro (Jamie Foxx) back again. Hearing their musical cues gave me goosebumps, as did some of their dialogues... It's a testament to the actors. There's some serious talent in The Sinister Six. I love their interactions. For a second you'll think to yourself how cool it all is, how you should just be thankful a film like this is even possible... But again, why have it at all if it isn't done correctly? Take for instance, the final battle, with one of the glaring objective errors of the film... Tobey's swingin' around, pulling off epic Spidey stunts, and there's no hint of Danny Elfman's beautiful theme... Same goes for Andrew Garfield, who had the privilege of having two great themes by James Horner and Hans Zimmer respectively. What was Michael Giacchino thinking!? He already dabbled in old themes for the villains, so why not for the heroes? If the movie is dead-set on fan-service and and legacy (which it most certainly is) then why on Earth not include these terrific tunes? Instead we just get orchestral renditions of Tom Holland's theme, which utterly PALES in comparison! It's just the same progression of notes.On to the Spider-Men themselves... Andrew Garfield has probably solidified himself as my favourite after watching this, while Tobey Maguire remains legendary by default since he was my childhood Spidey. Tom Holland doesn't come close. I never liked him in the role because he's not tangible. He's too pure and honest; thereby becoming illegitimate as a realistic humanistic interpretation. For whatever reason, Tobey Maguire gets stabbed, fatally it seems, by the Green Goblin. Thing is, he survives... So why bother scaring us? The moment doesn't serve a purpose, other than to provide a sudden, stupid shock for the poor audience. Ultimately, each of the villains fade away, back to their own universes. It's totally anti-climactic, not to mention there's no rematch or even a solid dialogue exchange between the Green Goblin and Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man. Malpractice from a storytelling standpoint; odd, considering that on the other hand you have a terrific scene where Andrew's Spider-Man catches MJ from falling to her death, as he failed to do so with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)... Does narrative closure not apply to all facets of these films? Or did the writers just get forgetful for Tobey? Either way, the ending leaves much to be desired and leaves you wondering: what was the point?Individually, scenes work well. But this isn't a clip show. It's a film. To conclude, No Way Home is a mess. One which nearly totally collapses prior to Andrew and Tobey's appearance. Their scenes are fantastic, and all criticisms aside for one minute, I am grateful I got to see 'em on the big screen one last time. I love it when they bond over shared losses, and Andrew and Tobey's little exchange in the lab... No Way Home is an occasional treat, however nonsensical and pointless on the whole.", "The most fan-servicey film that ever fan-serviced": "The cheers in the cinema said it all. This is a film for the fans of spider-man and is a Swan song to his history on the big screen. Sure some of the comedy doesn't quite hit, there are some pacing troubles and not every character has enough screen time to flesh out their character.But despite its problems, this film excels at listening to the fans and giving a spider-man movie that will be remembered as ending an era just as endgame is remembered for the avengers.", "so bad NO WAY IT'S AN 8.7...STOP THE FAKE RATINGS": "Zendaya such bad and just awful actress.Bad CGI, predictable script and dialogue again. .

Not just because it is bad, but because of the misuse of all the resources that went into making it.I will be the first to admit that I have propensity to look for meaning when I am watching a film. Be it the straight-forward moral of the story or a higher meaning, something to make you think. That is how I enjoy cinema the most, when it gives me something to think about. Big or small. When the images on the screen are about something more than simply the images on the screen.This film is the complete opposite of it. Its meaning is inward-looking. It is not interested of looking at anything other than itself. It is complete and utter navel-gazing. That really is the crux of the film. That is the reason why this is barely watchable. Every flaw and mistake comes from this movie's own excessive self-contemplation.Where to put the blame is a different question. It has been established for some time that these MCU films are not \"directed\". There is no singular vision behind them and it boils down to an assembly line. The plot and dialogue are so bad I can't imagine anyone put any amount of thought into it. All the lines do actually feel like ad-libs the actors improvised on the day. Visually there is an absence of flair (and I am being generous) which is on par for the course for these movies by now. The soundtrack and sound design is, of course, forgettable. The editing is conventional. The set design is reminiscent of those real-estate videos where celebrities show their homes. The costume design is ok, again which is not shocking knowing the means that were allocated to this.The acting could have been the saving grace of the movie. Unfortunately, Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon are the stars of the film. And while their performances are good, they usually have to share the screen with (multiple) Oscar-winners. It is jarring to see the best talent doing what is basically glorified background work. That is why this is the worst movie of all time. You have a film packed with the best actors working today, but we have to follow Tom Holland's inane struggle on how to apply to some college.I am not even sure I want to go into the plot. In truth it does not matter. I suspect that even the makers of this took that as a given. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now morphed into a never ending reference and call-backs machine. That is the core of this film: \"remember this?!\" The structure of it is one of a TV show, except in TV there is an A-plot and a B-plot. This film is all B-plot.As I am writing this, this film has been viewed by millions and is one of the highest grossing movies of all time. Please kill me now.", "I wanted to like this": "I watched this with no prior knowledge of the plot. I had heard rumours but not enough, so each cameo was a genuine surprise for me. Even with that element, I was left dejected.Why? Well, first of all it made no sense. It seemed a ridiculously contrived way of bringing back old villains and actors just for the nostalgia and fan nods without any real premise. It makes no sense that the all powerful all knowing Dr Strange would risk the stability of the universe to get a few kids into college. He knows far too much about actions and consequences to fall into that trap.And Peter's ridiculous idea to save the villains he doesn't know, who belong in another universe, and who have done despicable things to his own alter egos, using what...some science stuff that just happens to be in Happy's apartment? We never know quite how he builds these \"cures\", we just get blinded by movie science talk enough to understand that it's \"science\". Just like Peter trapping Dr Strange in the Mirror Dimension by using \"math\". It's like those old 80s movies where a computer whiz taps random things into a computer and it can do amazing things! How? We don't know, just shut up and eat your popcorn!The dialogue fell oddly flat too. I'm a Marvel fan and I enjoy the witty banter, one liners and emotional moments but this fell way short for me. The jokes weren't funny. The interplay between characters felt written by a kid trying to emulate Marvel wit. I just didn't feel it. The 3 Peters answering to Ned calling their name was just rubbish. It simply wasn't funny.And the sentimentality felt forced and false. They all cried so many times. Soaring music over the top. Tears and hugs and therapy. It descended into pathetic, and I didn't want to see good characters being pathetic. I get the angst and pain in previous movies but this was pointless and Peter literally destroyed everything including his last remaining family member over nothing. At least the other Peters' regrets were real. This was borne out of pure nonsensical decision making. He wanted to kill The Green Goblin. Why? He was only there because of Peter making ridiculous choices and Aunt May only died because she was as stupid and misguided as Peter. He was just doing what villains do given half a chance - a chance Peter gave him for no logical reason.The fact he saved them in the end was irrelevant and actually did a massive disservice to the previous movies. It devalues what those other Peters did and went through. You may as well cure them too by stopping them getting bitten by spiders in the first place if you're going to be that kind hearted and change history.Would those villains really want to go back to their universe a changed person anyway? They were flawed, broken and destroyed everything they loved. Now they get to go back all \"fixed\"...to what? A broken destroyed world they ruined to no doubt face justice for it. Great, thanks Peter! I think their glorious deaths would have been better. Or are the other Spidermen supposed to smooth it all over when they return?And last but not least, the whole \"forget everyone knows who Spider-Man is\" thing is just crazy. As if Dr Strange hasn't learned enough from trying to do it the first time. Why forget Peter Parker completely? Why not just forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man so he keeps his friends etc? So there was Happy at Aunt May's grave not knowing this was her nephew? That makes no sense at all. What happened at the Statue of Liberty then? What did MJ and Ned remember?I came out of the theatre disappointed. It wasn't like MJ said. I actually expected not to be disappointed, which made it worse.", "Greatest Marvel film in potentially a decade": "Following constant disappointment with Marvel movies, I had come to stop caring for or even watching any. But Spider-man has had a special place in my heart since a kid so I had to watch, especially after hearing rumours. To tell the truth, this exceeded my expectations with great power.With surprisingly good acting and great emotionally loaded scenes, No Way Home managed to capture something many Marvel movies fail. Emotions. This was not only an action-packed movie but also a story-driven movie with fantastic execution. Tom Holland and Zendaya as well as other actors managed to deliver acting never seen in the Marvel universe before.No Way Home captured that heart of the first couple of Spider-man trilogy which I think old fans will admire. Nevertheless, I believe this movie was fantastically done and little mistakes.No Way Home is a great movie I highly recommend. Especially to the Marvel fans like me that had gotten bored of the new stuff.", "Best Holland's Spider-Man and a crowd pleasing milestone to the MCU": "I do not think this is a totally perfect film: It is too damn easily to spoil it, probably the middle section is not as powerful as the start and the epic finale, some of the characters are thrown into the plot rather than enjoy a well developed evolution like Peter Parker himself and I was not exactly a fan of Holland's era due to a lackluster couple of previous solo films. But this third solo movie is his best film to date, one of the most impactful MCU & Superhero movies and one outing that redeems and answers all my complaints regarding what came before.Here, MCU's Peter Parker finally shows some cracks and faces true trauma, developing a true commitment to his own adventure even being extremely populated by plenty of beloved and nostalgic other ones. Here, Parker's Spider-Man finally gets to grown in me, being faithful to the source and ending his evolution within Avengers universe on a riprousingly high. The performances are really strong, the script covers its plotholes & weaknesses with energy, tragedy and fun so well mixed and the ending looks like a true ending to Holland's Spider-Man trilogy.An excellent entertainment and a shocking surprise. I did not buy any trailer nor stinger from this movie and I was blown away. Best Spider-Man movie tied with 'Spider-Verse' and Sam Raimi's 2004 sequel. See it now!", "One of the best experiences": "This was one of the most impressive cinema experiences I ever had. Spider-Man: No Way Home really had it all. I still have no words for what I just witnessed.Amazing.", "What is the hype?": "I decided to go see this movie because of the 8.9 rating, which was based on more than 200,000 reviews. Honestly, I am shocked. The movie was so boring that I actually fell asleep at one point. The plot was very childish and unnecessarily long. I heard that some people actually left the theater out of boredom. I assume the high rating was only possible because of such strong a fandom. Overall, I felt like I just lost 2.5 hours of my life.", "Sad and mindless 2.5 hrs": "I feel sad to be living in a time where a movie like this can get high ratings. This movie is for low-attention-span adrenaline-immuned viewers, which unfortunately there are more and more of. Unless you are a group of teenagers looking for a night-out, I would not recommend this movie at all.I didn't expect much from this movie other to be an entertaining comic-book-like story. Boy, was I disappointed. It has been no more than a collection of random fight scenes with incoherent story and almost random dialogues in-between. Also, I think the casting of Spider-man, M. J. and Aunt May are just horrible. Tom Holland appears to have the brain of a 10-year old, and Zendaya is great in other films, but as MJ she just doesn't work, same goes for Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) she looks way too young, flirty and brainless, exact opposite of what this character should be.Overall it is a slaughterhouse to everything that spider-man should stand for. It is concentrated around universes and egocentric personal problems instead of being a moral model of real-world problems. The 2.5 hours long movie seem to just be an adrenaline shot one after the other, no substance and nothing to learn from. I'm sadden by having to write this, the production quality is great but where is a plot, a moral and generally being a better person. Sony should be ashamed of themselves for dragging Stan Lee's creation through the mud like that and Marvel should consider terminating their license for this creation. Seriously.", "The best live action Spider-Man film ever made and probably ever will be made for that matter": "\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is the third solo Spider-Man movie to be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Tom Holland once again in the lead role, it goes without saying that this is the best live action Spider-Man film ever made and probably ever will be made for that matter.In the events after \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\", the secret identity of Peter Parker (Tom Holland) as Spider-Man has been exposed to the entire world after his fight with Quentin Beck/Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). No longer being able to take the onslaught of media and public backlash, Peter seeks help from Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to cast a spell to make everyone forget he is Spider-Man. However, during the casting of the spell, Peter accidentally causes things to go wrong, fracturing the multiverse and leading to the emergence of many villains from realities unfamiliar to this one.Aside from Batman, the superhero that has left the most impact on me personally is Spider-Man. In fact, the very first superhero film I ever saw at the cinema was the 2002 Sam Raimi-directed \"Spider-Man\" starring Tobey Maguire. I'd probably go as far to say it is that film I credit with helping to kick-start my fondness for the genre as a whole, paving the way for many others like it. With \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" acknowledging not only the original Raimi films but the Marc Webb-directed, Andrew Garfield-led \"Amazing Spider-Man\" films as well, there was bound to be a lot of speculation surrounding whether or not it could live up to all this hype. In short, the answer is a resounding yes.Not since \"Avengers: Endgame\" has a Marvel superhero film affected me on such an emotional level and not since the 2008 \"Iron Man\" film has a solo hero story left this much of an impact. Of course, to discuss my favourite parts would give away vital spoilers so I won't go into too much detail here. I absolutely love the amount of respect paid to each of these series of films. Even the divisive \"Amazing Spider-Man\" films, which I actually liked despite their flaws, are treated with just as much love and affection as their Raimi/MCU counterparts. Moments like these go beyond simple fanservice and are clearly there as a thank you to everyone who have stuck with this iconic hero for almost twenty years now. They certainly put a big smile on the face of this responsible 30-something adult.The concept of the multiverse was first teased back in \"Avengers: Endgame\" and further elaborated on in the Disney+ series \"Loki\". However, for the most part, those ventures had a proper sense of management preventing things from spiralling out of control. Here, everything feels like fair game. The stakes are at an all time high as these villains pour out from their respective universes to seek vengeance on their particular Peter Parker, not knowing that they won't find him here at all. Anyone who knows me will remember that I love stories that involve alternate realities and history, so to see something like this combined with a film about one of my favourite superheroes was nothing short of wonderful. This film keeps you on your toes as you anticipate who Spider-Man will fight next. Again, I won't reveal which of the villain fights excited me the most due to spoilers so all I will say is that each of them had at least one moment that made the young kid inside me very happy.Tom Holland has come a long way since we first saw him don the Spider-Man suit back in \"Captain America: Civil War\". His high-spirited youthfulness has not waned over the past five years since he still has that uncanny ability to entertain us with his unique take on the beloved hero. That's not to say he is only capable of light-hearted fun, as here we see him demonstrate some of his darkest acting to date. This film definitely isn't afraid to hit us hard in the feels at the most appropriate times, frequently delving deep into Peter Parker's emotional state at such an important point in his life.Additionally, I have finally come to accept Zendaya's performance as MJ. It has taken me three films but her version of the character has finally grown on me. Originally, I found her pessimistic attitude and willingness to bring the mood down highly annoying but she has now matured into a vital ally of Peter that I enjoy seeing on screen. Naturally, her chemistry with Holland feels genuine, considering the two actors are actually dating in real life with their romantic scenes adding that much needed heart to the film.I won't speak at length about any specific villain as that will give away major spoilers so all I will say is that seeing each of them again in one place was quite overwhelming, but this time in a good way. It's both amusing and surprising to see Raimi-era villains interact with Webb-era villains who are equally as confused as to why they have been transported into this universe. Something that certain Spider-Man films have come under fire for is their cramming of too many villains into one movie, leaving the story cluttered and incomprehensible. This time around, it actually works to the film's advantage since the idea of there being multiple universes following a different timeline has already been properly established. Something like this leaves things open for other multiverse-related oddities happening in future MCU projects, which excites me greatly.Since the film has set the bar so high, I can't help but wonder how the MCU will ever be able to top it. Like \"Avengers: Endgame\" before it, \"No Way Home\" should be treated as something of a watershed moment in the entire MCU. It succeeds in entertaining both longtime fans of the Spider-Man character who have been watching him for nearly twenty years while simultaneously serving the purpose as a great continuation of the ever-expanding MCU storyline. With that said, I think all fans of Spider-Man owe it to themselves to see this film as soon as possible. And yes, I do mean ALL fans.I rate it a solid 9/10.", "SpideyVerse": "Went to see this opening day to avoid spoilers and boy was i pleased i did. Going in not knowing what was going to happen made the movie so much better. Seeing Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire & Tom Holland all together really is a fans dream and Marvel are giving so much fan service in all their movies lately it really is staggering.I feel most of all, the movie does well in giving Andrew Garfield some love as the Spider-Man character as he mostly gets a raw deal these days as his movies weren't as strong as Raimi's or MCU ones. Andrew Garfield was a good Peter Parker & Spider-Man, he just didn't get that film where he could really shine and this movie practically says as much.Managing to get so many villains to reprise their roles must have been a tall order (i was more surprised to see Thomas Hayden Church back than anyone).The story grips you right from the off as it takes place immediately after the second one & some of the twists and turns i found quite shocking (i should have known better about Aunt May but it still took me by surprise).The ending is really beautiful in a nice sort of way, seeing Peter interact with MJ after the fact is a real heartstring puller. It ends with a conclusion to the trilogy whilst leaving the door ajar for more Tom Holland Spider-Man movies (which if there is any justice, there will be).Tom Hardy's cameo at the end sets up Venom (or at the very least, a version of) to join the MCU, which should be a blast. The idea of Tom Hardy & Holland playing off of each other is cinematic gold.All in all, i think this is the strongest MCU Spider-Man movie and may be the ultimate one for massive Spider-Man fans. Sam Raimi could never have imagined 20 years ago whilst making Spider-Man (2002) that his characters would be still portraying themselves all these years later in the biggest cinematic universe and franchise ever, truly remarkable, just like this film.", "One of the worst films of all time": "Embarassing. Cheap fanservice. Nostalgia feeding. Plot points that make no sense. Awful action. And terrible, behaviour between the three spidermen.I however must give respect to Willem Dafoe for his diamond in the rough performance. The few lines of dialogue he had brought me back to 2002.", "Energetic and Colorful, But Also Meandering and Overloaded": "Instantly loathing the publicity of being outed by the press, Spider-Man hits up the Sanctum Sanctorum to ask Dr. Strange for some mystical assistance. They cast a spell of wiped memory and screw it up, reality is torn, familiar faces invade different spaces... you know this, you've seen the trailer. It's the Sony/MCU equivalent of X-Men: Days of Future Past, with a stream of old band members coming out of retirement for a jam-packed farewell concert.One might hope that the results are a smidge better than that old X-Men reunion, and they are, but No Way Home also suffers from many of the same problems. Primarily, the overwhelming urge to stuff as much crap on the screen as possible, even when the audience is already exhausted. It tries to serve too many masters and, in the end, sufficiently serves none. There's fun to be had, especially when the oddball mix-and-match super-characters get the chance to escape the trappings of a broader storyline and simply converse as individuals. Those accessible human interactions have been a big strength for the two preceding Marvel Spider-Man flicks, and they reap great benefits here, each time the old guard mingles with the new.I wish we had more such moments, but the push to turn the MCU's most grounded franchise into another big-time tent pole attraction demands otherwise. In reaching for the next major event, they've overlooked the \"neighborhood\" part of \"Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.\" Actually, they might've forgotten the \"friendly\" part, too, because there's a whole bunch of angst spinning around Tom Holland's central performance. But that's more excusable: Peter Parker goes through a lot over the course of this hundred-fifty minutes, he progresses and matures as a character, and he's experienced equally dark times in the comics.No, the performances aren't the issue here, nor is the dialogue, which remains snappy and delightful. The primary culprit is the plot, bloating and careening in indeterminate (and often mindless) directions, making a lot of noise but not making a lot of sense. Dr. Strange hand-waves many explanations under the guise of mysticism, which is basically his thing, but so do the various Spider-Men. Important members of the supporting cast are marginalized and under-served. The city of New York, once an essential ingredient, is now barely a backdrop. Goalposts are moved, overshadowed, and then moved again. Rumor has it that script re-writes were still underway during filming, and it shows.This is messy. Lots of fun on certain occasions, but stifling and sludgy in others. It's a mixed bag, leaning more to the positive than the negative, but I don't know that I'm content with the way everything wraps up in the end. Where Homecoming and Far From Home both left me charged and anxious for the next step, No Way Home put me in a place of quiet acceptance. Feels like the franchise has aged, and that's not a great thing.", "one of the best cinema experiences": "I'm from the uk so we don't really do all that kind of cheering in cinemas. But oh my god. I've never seen anything like it there were so many moments during this film where the cinema just exploded, pure excitement coming from almost everyone, including me.Even though it was quite bittersweet i cannot wait to watch this movie again, this is a top 3 mcu movie.The score was just fantastic, acting amazing, even the small bits of fan service just put a smile on my face. There's not much else i can say about this film, except how excited it's made me for the future of the mcu.", "Lacking in story. Good in action.": "So for me to really love a movie i have to love everything about it and not just pieces of it. And there was basically no story here. The story of the whole movie is Spiderman asks dr strange to make the world forget him. And the rest of the movie is about the villains that show up basically just joking around having fun and trying to kill Spiderman. Reacting to the story without really adding anything to it.The rest of the movie has a lot of plot holes. A whole Lot. Like for the movie to happen Spiderman has to suddenly think he can cure mental illness. And To suddenly realize that the giant lizard man was left behind in the van. Maybe we was going to go to the 7-11 and bring back a mountain dew. Who know what they were thinking. But this scene and others like it feel so forced and does not happen naturally.The spells and how they backfire make zero sense..but we could debate that all day.I feel like the most wasted opportunity was to not bring Gwen Stacy back from the dead to reunite with Garfield Spiderman. Everyone else was dead .its not a leap to say Gwen could come back too. And of Course No James Franco...a huge wasted opportunity.Overall not the best marvel movie. But not the worst.", "Deluded by the hype": "If this movie didn't have the 3 boys joining forces it would've been a 6/10 for me. What we got was a shaky plot with Ned whipping out doctor strange moves after 0 training and peter risking the universe collapsing for the lives of a few random villains. Lazy lazy writingAnd the end fight we had maybe 10 seconds of our 3 Spider-Men fighting together. The rest was choppy scenes of each character fighting their respective villians. Where was the unity? Thats what we wanted, some combo moves between the 3 at least :(There were obviously some great moments dont get me wrong but i feel people aren't really taking the movie for what it is. Deluded by the marvel hypeThis is what happens when the hype is too big. What was MJ's line on disappointment? Yeah it applies to this film.My 4 main issues...1. Ned mastering the Doctor Strange Ring instantly (0 training)\n2. Peter's decision to steal the cube from doctor strange because he wanted to \"cure\" a few villains and consequently risk his universe\n3. Needed a few more scenes where the spidermen fight in unison ( we got 10 seconds of them swinging together)\n4. Tobey's entrance was lame and should've been utilised during the end fight.", "Just hear me out": "It was a real good movie with a decent story and fun action but this movie is way too overrated just because it got all the famous actors i really don't think this is a good reason to describe a good movie and let's be honest they did a great job at mixing all these universe's.", "the level of stupidity is astounding": "The only good thing about this movie is the visual affects. I wasted 2.5 hours watching this. I was really waiting for something exceptional based on the reviews this movie got. But in reality it is worse than matrix resurrections.", "Third Time's the Best Charm": "For the first time in nearly 20 years, I may have seen my favorite Spider-Man movie.And I'm not like a kid who loves the Ice Age movies and since part 17 is the newest one they've seen, it's their favorite. (Much like what they said about the 16 before it.) Nope. I sat from almost the first 10 minutes LOVING this movie and debating if this actually beat out the magnificent 2002's Spider-Man and its even better follow-up, 2004's Spider-Man 2.I will say this: This is my new 2nd favorite of ALL 27 MCU movies. Easy. And it's easily in the top three of the 10 theatrical-released Spider-Man movies. In fact, since part 2 in 2004, I have not been impressed with any of the Spider-Man movies until Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse and this third Tom Holland-led Spider-Man series.I barely liked Tom's Spider-Man: Homecoming and I refer to it Iron Man Jr because it was WAY more about Iron Man smarts and involvement and it clearly made Peter a complete moron who couldn't lift a finger or figure out anything on his own without big-daddy Tony helping. Tom's Spider-Man: Far From Home was better, but it still couldn't let go of Tony (EVEN after his character supposedly left the franchise.) This second rebooted version of Spider-Man of Tom Holland's made me sad, because of how dumb Peter is and how reliant he is on others, namely big-daddy Tony. This is NOT the brilliant Peter Parker I grew up with.But, FINALLY...they got it right with Tom's third movie. The trailer spoiled SO MUCH of this movie and the actors involved, as trailers are designed to be spoiler packed (usually the very last scene of the movie is in the trailer,) so I won't even go into the synopsis or what happens or who's in it. I just HIGHLY encourage you to see this ASAP and know: they FINALLY got Spider-Man right. After 5 disappointing follow-ups to Spider-Man 2, THEY FINALLY GOT SPIDER-MAN BACK ON TRACK.I laughed so hard, even though it wasn't like the traditional MCU movie where it's mostly a comedy. These were genuine jokes and not just inserted to please the audience who apparently wants more comedic MCU movies than action-packed Super-Hero movies. I cried a bit, even though it's mostly an uplifting movie. And yes, I marveled on how well acted and written this film is. Everybody gave it their 110% and no one stole scenes or out-performed anyone else. This was MY Endgame event.I loved this movie so much, I probably will buy it right away on Blu upon release. And to give you a hint of how much that is to me: I don't really buy Blurays anymore due to the convenience of streaming and of ALL 27 MCU movies, I only bought two so far. The rest, I can watch online if I feel like it. Most are forgettable, anyways.I heard they're building a new trilogy with Tom Holland continuing his role as Spidey. To be frank, before this viewing, I almost didn't want to see them. If this turned out just slightly better than Tom's 2nd one which was just slightly better than his mediocre 1st one, I was pretty much done.Now, my Spidey-Sense is tingling to see what they have in store for us next.", "A Cash Grab for a Willing Marvel Fan": "It would be unfair to say that I never really laud as great films BUT I always admire this ability to create quality escapism.With all that, I think Spider-Man: No Way Home might be the first film of that series that I actually hate .Firstly, this film feels so juvenile to the point that it is annoying. I guess this is a film not really made for me. I found the way Hollands tries to plays up the good boy persona exceedingly off-putting AND not needed. Zendaya and the Filipino guy are just a figment on its story. They even tried to gentrify the \"other\" versions of Spiderman film. Funnily, I love all the treatment for the Original Spiderman characters. Otherwise, its a mixed bag.Secondly, I found the cause of conflict in the film so unnecessary. It does not make sense for me why and how it happened. It feels like watching a cash grab for fans.I mean the conflict of the film is that his presence as a superhero has such a negative effects to their live that they were ultimately banned to their collegiate school BUT it is contrast with a rally showing their popularity too. It is like be consistent film. Even the spell is hinged on the fact that they did not plan. They go on as if this is a thing he does every time BUT he just goes for it without really thinking through of the whatnots. Ultimately, the choice of Holland Peter to armchair psychologist ughh. Just watch it, its like a Bob the Builder-esque plot line.Ultimately, what really sour me about the film is the Dr Strange Conundrum. Why even watch when the consequences can be reversed and played on? I mean, he did had some in the end BUT is it really not deserved. As a viewer, I hate it from since the Avenger films BUT I hate it more so this time, because it actively says it can AND it can even personalize it.Overall, this is a pure cash grab for people who are watching it for the characters but not the content. Its pretty much anchored on a very weak premise AND feels like a connective tissue for things to come. [0.5/5]", "This really puts a smile on my face": "To keep this spoiler free and brief I'll just say this, keep away from any leaks and just go see it when you can and you'll love it even more.

After Mysterio reveals Peter Parker's(Tom Holland) true identity, Peter's world is turned upside down. Peter goes to Doctor Strange(Benedict Cumberbatch), to make the world forget he's Spider-Man. However, the spell goes awry & villains from the multiverse show up. Now, Peter will find out what it truly means to be Spider-Man.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an awe-inspiring film. Director Jon Watts has perfectly completed his Spider-Man trilogy. The action set pieces are jaw-dropping. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The humor & the emotional scenes are on point, just like every other Spidey movie. You will cry, laugh and cheer till your voice gets hoarse. Tom Holland is spectacular as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Tom Holland further solidifies that his portrayal of the iconic superhero, is the best. Zendaya is outstanding as MJ. Holland & Zendaya share electrifying chemistry, in all their scenes together. Jacob Batalon is superb as Ned Leeds. Jamie Foxx is brilliant as Max Dillon/Electro. Willem Dafoe is phenomenal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. Dafoe proves yet again, why he's the best Spider-Man villain in the entire franchise. Alfred Molina is excellent as Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus. Thomas Haden Church is great as Flint Marko/Sandman. Rhys Ifans is impressive as Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. The supporting cast is unforgettable. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a must watch for die-hard and casual Spider-Man fans.

I laughed cried sat on the edge of my seat this film is amazing and a must watch for all marvel fans. It may not go as crazy as some will hope but this is at its centre a character piece about Peter Parker and it sets him up for a great arc.

There are other surprises aswell some you might be able to guess some you might not.", "I'm Sure It's Fun for Die Hard Fans": "\"Spider-Man\" fans are going to have a total nerdgasm over this movie. Those of us who haven't seen all the Spider-Man movies and aren't knowledgeable about the Marvel universe may have a good time but also might be left wondering what all the hoopla is about.I only saw the first two Tobey Maguire Spider-Mans and didn't see any of the Andrew Garfield ones, but Tom Holland is definitely my favorite actor to play him. This movie is too bogged down by exposition and has a saggy middle section that tries for heart-tugging drama -- why, why do these junk food movies try to be more serious than they should? -- but I will admit that the ending gave me the feels.

One of the few things I noticed while watching this film is how intimate it was with the audience. More than ever we begin to see things from Peter's point of view, and it sculpts a very touching and emotional narrative that is easily the best execution in a Marvel property in a while. While there are some small things I think they could have touched up a bit better, this film was massively entertaining, incredibly funny, and surprisingly very emotional in the best way possible. It blends the past characters so well into its story you hardly feel it's their first time in the universe. Even more, it's such a unique experience to finally see 3 generations of superhero fans unite for such an epic opportunity- of which seems more than well done- almost too good to be true at times. It may not be perfect, but personally- I loved nearly every minute of it, and can't wait to see what this franchise continues to offer down the road.My Rating: 9.5/10.", "Amazing Movie, Amazing Theatre Experience": "It was seriously amazing, had some very great suprisesBeen a while since a crowed cheered that much in a Theatre, Great.Mid- and End Credits contains great suprises.", "It's not a film": "No plot at all.

Peter Parker, unmasked, asks Doctor Strange to make everyone forget him, then hedges, then everything gets weird as a bunch of bad guys from previous Spider-Man movie series start wreaking havoc.The multiverse is, of course, a major component of Into the Spider-verse, but while that was brilliant and cool, here it comes across as profoundly silly.So in my head I was seeing this as the silliest of all Spider-man movies; a ludicrous romp with fun mindless action. And then, in a weird tonal shift, the movie gets really dark, and then tries to go back to the light-hearted bit with that hanging over it, and does some more really silly stuff, and some rather confused but fast-paced action, and then goes for a sad thing that I found kinda boring, and, well, what is this supposed to *be*.It doesn't make much sense, it's tonally chaotic, and as with the previous film, the action is fleetfully enjoyable but entirely forgettable.Still, a reasonable amount of the humor works, it's fun to see the way they play with the multiverse, and there's definitely fun to be had. But I find it perplexing how many people love this movie because to me it's a mess. It should have just stuck with silly all the way through.", "Might be the best Spider-Man movie till date! Even if it's not perfect.": "I just watched the movie at the theatre and you really don't wanna miss this one out. I will make it simple, the movie will live to your expectations If not exceed them, however, during the first half of the film you won't witness anything new. Every fight scene is in the trailer and I LITREALLY mean every fight scene. But don't get me wrong they were awesome and of course not the whole fight scenes. It's also full of talking and a bit more funny lines than usual. You also have a very very silly plot that was based on some character's opinion and lead to all the events of the film and then comes on of the best plots and entrances near the beginning of the second half that you will ever witness and here comes the second half of the movie and trust me it was beyond awesome. The VFX of this film is breathtaking. Every action sequence is very complicated and loaded with tons of details. The visuals are insaaane. You also have a couple of Spidy suits and most importantly you won't be disappointed with anything you might be expecting. You have Dr. Strange and believe me it was one of the best times you will see him along with another hero cause Benedict is such a great actor. Zendaya role however was meaningless but you know she is Spidy's GF. The Finale of the film is beyond great and feels like a dream come true for all fans around the world that will leave you full of emotions, amazed and shocked! Even the two post credit scenes made everyone yell in the theatre (who yelled for more than half of the movie). Not a perfect movie and a lot of things may not make sense and will make your brain full of questions like Endgame and that's what make a movie a great one. I have now experienced the whole trilogy at the theatre and there is no doubt that this one is the best.

It has Raimi written all over it, and even at its worst moments, the least you could dub it is memorable. The follow-up series doesn't have that same appeal, but Garfield's charisma shines through, as it similarly does here. Conversely, Holland's rendition has always felt a little cut-and-paste from its surrounding universe, unable to separate itself from the whimsy and bathos of the MCU. This Peter Parker's one-liners are drawn from the same snarky persona as Iron Man, Star-Lord, War Machine, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man...the list goes on. I've made my peace with it. It isn't a new criticism, and could be levelled at most films post-Phase One. But it's always felt limiting in terms of crafting distinct character (and filmic) voices and undermining attempts at sentimentality. Let's start with Cumberbatch's Strange. He's stepping into the mentor role post-Endgame but he's never been given a meaningful opportunity to develop his own philosophy on the character, let alone a voice. Sans his solo film, the premise of the Sorcerer Supreme makes him a convenient plot device to facilitate the adventures of other superheroes. Listen to his dialogue here; it's always delivered at a distance, drenched in cynicism, as if it's afraid of fully buying into the idea of a connection. Cumberbatch seems to be constantly setting up the next punchline, and so even if this abrasive back-and-forth elicits laughs, it never builds to anything genuine, rendering the climatic callback (obvious from a mile away) into a deflated attempt at growth and recognition. Yes, RDJ addressed Holland in the same way, but there was history and a relationship there. There's an inherent self-consciousness to the way that Feige and co. Craft the MCU's humour, so relentlessly wary of losing the audience for more than a second that they keep sincerity at an arm's length. Observe how the entire film just grinds to a halt for the Spidey's stand-up routine atop the Statue of Liberty scaffolding; the trialogue isn't written for the characters, it's written for the fans to play spot the reference (\"You're amazing. I want to hear you say it.\"). Marvel would never in a million years allow their Spider-Man to be the butt of the joke, or freeze-frame on his goofy smile over 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head'. He's too cool for that.This universe's Peter Parker and his defining Spider-Man moment is how he reacts to losing his Uncle Ben, but the crux of its emotional impact rests on what has already been established. What do we really know about this version of Aunt May, anyway? No, not what we surmise and assume based on the previous actions of the mentor archetype, but her as an actual person. How much screentime has Tomei been afforded here and in the first two films that isn't delegated to punchlines about her hotness or her apparent fling with Happy? You need to earn the right to drop that iconic line about responsibility; the words don't hold any weight in and of themselves. What does follow her death works in pushing Peter into newer and darker territory for this Spider-Man, and Holland is finally asked to consider the interiority of his character and how these circumstances might actually damage the psyche of a teenager. After all, what was the complication of Far From Home beyond mopping up the external mess of an Avengers-level threat? Here, Peter must contend with the consequences of his actions (the film initially made me balk at the idea of resetting the universe just so a few teens could get accepted into their college of choice, and then cleverly flips that on its head) and ultimately assume the burden and emotional baggage that comes with being a superhero. The rooftop scene where Maguire and Garfield confess of their own failures and futile quests for vengeance is unlike anything even the MCU is capable of; it's not merely a crossover, but a character speaking across generations to itself, pleading for this Peter to avoid repeating their past mistakes. It leans pretty hard on the audience having that pre-knowledge; you need to know the stories they refer to in order to buy into the emotion, but for those who do, it's genuinely affecting.So Peter completes his mission and manages to do justice to Aunt May's final wish, but what of the 'villains'? The other core theme of the film, beyond Peter's grappling with his grief and the value of revenge, is the idea of second chances being afforded to those who deserve them (who, in Aunt May's world, is everyone). Yet how much of this actually rings true for each member of the Spidey rogues gallery dragged in from the multiverse? Norman and Otto are afforded the most agency as a result of their characters' redemption being more or less pre-ordained. They don't need 'fixing', just a removal of that corruptive influence and a reversion to their original selves. But what of the others? Electro is stripped of his powers and therefore his bloodlust, makes a brief quip referencing Miles Morales, and then is returned to live life as his pre-superpowered, nerdy outcast self. What lesson does he learn? Sandman, as one of the relatively more sympathetic villains of the Spideyverse, was already redeemed at the end of his chapter and never even died at the hands of Spider-Man, so his appearance here is puzzling, reduced once more to an angry CGI spectacle that hits things (Thomas Haden Church receives all of 20 seconds of screentime, with the rest of his stay in sand form). Peter may take responsibility for mistakes made and change himself for good, but how much of this change transfers over to those he impacted? It's a little too neat of a thematic bow to tie all these different arcs together in the name of redemption. The action itself is fine, inoffensive; the climactic battle starts off poorly for the Spideys, before Holland gives a pep talk about teamwork and they then execute a series of pre-planned, carefully choreographed moves in front of a blue screen, only this time it works! There's nothing actually revealed about leadership or teamwork here, but we don't care; we just want that master shot of their superhero landings. It's screensaver material.Legacy is key here: that of this live-action universe across three generations of the webslinger, of the characters within their worlds, and of the films themselves. It's now nigh impossible to engage with this franchise without consuming each and every chapter of its storytelling, an increasingly mammoth task that grows with each phase, miniseries, and cinematic event. You can't just view them as one-offs; you need to buy in and subscribe and devote time to tracking and keeping tabs on its chronology. Your reward is the payoff for this dedication; you know that character, you know the event that they are referencing when it comes up on the big screen. Garfield's Peter is forced to relive the same moment that led to Gwen's death during his rescue of MJ, and fans can recognise the trauma it induces and how significant and moving it is for him to be able to save her this time round. Other fans, however, from the looks of internet reaction videos, seem to be cheering in recognition of this. Is that not emblematic of the two camps of MCU takes in conflict with each other? I'm unsure whether they can or should be conflated. In 2012, when the MCU was still in its infancy, Ebert wrote this of The Avengers: \"It provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable.\" I think we do deserve these films. We've supported the franchise from its early rocky beginnings, and we've been there every step of the way in its evolution into a cultural giant. I experienced my own payoff, as millions around the world did, seeing Avengers Endgame almost a decade later as each character stepped out of their portals, the goosebumps on my arm as close to something quantifiable for that feeling of awe and yes, recognition. What lies in future for this franchise, and what is (if there are any plans for, commercial or otherwise) its endgame? I didn't feel anything of that calibre watching No Way Home, but I think it still sticks its landing. Having sacrificed his own relationships to fix the mess that emerged from his faults, Holland returns to where I think Peter Parker truly belongs: in a run-down apartment, landlord berating him for the rent, once again alone with only his suit for company. But there's a reason why the most important scenes are always shot with the mask off. This is where the core and heart of the character resides, and what Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Verse understood so well: the power was never a choice, but accepting the responsibility that comes with it is. Holland's Peter finally makes that choice, and in doing so unveils the human behind the mythos of the superhero. No nanotech or Instant-Kill Mode could ever make up for that.", "The Biggest, Grandest And Most Exhilarating Spidey Flick Ever Appeared On Big Screen!": "Spider-Man : No Way Home (2021) -\nMovie Review :The first trilogy of Spider-Man, directed by Sam Raimi, has a special place in everyone's heart. Tobey Maguire's Spidey became a memory, nostalgia for the kids who are adults now. After that so-so, decent Amazing Spider-Man, Marvel Studios brought this popular character in Avengers' Universe with Captain America: Civil War (2014) and MCEU fans went crazy. The Superhero got his own films Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man (2019), which made Tom Holland a household name. These films had that heroic touch of Iron Man (perhaps the most popular Avenger for the Fans), and now we have No Way Home as a whole new crazy Universe post Endgame. If you love Spider-Man movies, if you love Marvel movies, if you love Doctor Strange and if you love all those villains you saw in Spidey films over the years, then you are gonna enjoy this film like a festival. One hell of cobweb it is, and the Superlative Spidey smashes it in style. But, he is not alone. This is Holland's first Spider-Man film where Tony Stark does not appeared, but still he is not alone. Jon Watts, Marvel and Sony have delivered us a Gigantic Blockbuster Spider-Man Saga as a Christmas Present in advance.Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer was full of story, yet it has a lot of surprises stored for the final product. In the end credit scene of Far From Home we saw Parker being exposed, and now in No Way Home he wants people to forget that. He asks Dr. Stephen Strange makes his identity as Spider-Man a secret again with magic but an overload of time dimensions breaks open the multiverse and allows five supervillains from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe. Parker has to battle out the mess he has created and what more surprises he has to offer, must be kept secret by me. Yes, no spoilers at all. They are busy trending #DontSpoilNoWayHome on Twitter and I respect that. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers' writing keeps you extremely busy during the watch, while the screenplay has no dull moments whatsoever. Just one condition, you don't have to look for the logic because you're watching a Marvel/Sony's Superhero film, not Christopher Nolan's Cinema.Sony and Marvel Entertainment have made a fantastic film like Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse (animation), which may remain unbeatable for years. No Way Home is like a Feature Film version of that intelligently nutty film. If I have to pick the best Feature Film (Superhero) recently, then No Way Home certainly tops the list. Jon Watts brings the madness of multiverse and passion of Spider-Verse together in MCU's Spider-Man No Way Home. A combination that will leave fans screaming out for the repeat watch. No Way Home is packed with solid action, fantastic story, lots of surprises; plenty of Heroic stuff, large size explosions, king-size entertainment and last but not the least, touching emotions. It saves a lot of cliches from becoming cliches. The climax will break the hearts of many Spidey fans but that's where the cinematic magic lies. You need an USP factor beyond that regular commercial potboiler, that's what it is. No Way Home will unite Avengers Fans and old Spidey Fans, and this Union is gonna explode at the box office. As a whole, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a smashing Blockbuster. MCU's most exhilarating entertainer post Endgame phenomena and believe it or not, it has the same amount of fans-crazy hysteria. Just go on hooting, no matter how much the ticket costs because the show worths it.RATING - 7/10*", "Hype carried the movie..": "It was a pretty decent movie, but the ones who are yelling, and saying it's the best MCU movie ever.. or the best Spider-Man Movie ever.. i don't think so.. It's jst the hype talking so much, the comedy as usual MCU always tries too much to be funny.. and it fails.. This film is carried out by cameos.. Lazy writing.. The only good thing was the ending.. That's it.. Definitely not the best.. and not an 8 IMDB rated movie.. Dr Strange is better than this IMO..", "Your Senses Gonna Blow So Hard!": "It's...I'm still trying to realize what I've seen, but I've seen things I didn't think I'd ever see on the big screen! We all know that spoilers have been on the internet for more than a year, but apart from the things we thought, there are a lot of other things and of course I won't spoil anything, but...the film pulls very thin string from our emotions and it worked perfectly!The story is solid, it's not just fan service, which was one of my fears, there are explanations for everything. Holland grows in front our eyes with this role and this is one of the many pleasant aspects of the film. Strange's role is important (not a big shock).The villains are...I felt like a kid watching Spider-Man: The Animated Series again...I don't even know where to start. The film has more than a big stake and in some places you stand on the edge of your seat.The action scenes are the best I've ever seen in a Spidey movie and are generally among the best in comicbook movies! There are so many well-coordinated scenes, that after the movie you will want to watch them again and again.There are a lot of dialogues that hit the emotions really hard and that will be quoted long after the movie. In some places you even want the villains to prevail, because it looks so good and you want more and more and more...There are comedic moments of course, most of which well placed, but compared to the previous two films, this one is much darker and more serious. Like I said, Spidey is growing up, and that's tangible. There are a lot of surprises, some smaller, others bigger, but the movie certainly deserves more than one watch with friends. The hall was exploding! (Endgame vibes).Michael Giacchino's music, as always, is remarkable. The classic Spidey soundtrack mixed with some darker elements is a delight for the ears.Open your eyes on four, because there are a lot of references, some more tangible than others, but hardcore fans will be more than happy with what they saw.Knowing that this movie leads straight to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness...you better prepare for the unexpected!", "Whoever came up with this idiot idea should be fired.": "They wanted to find an ingenious way to put all the Spider-Mans together... and they DIDN'T.And why would they bother?! What does this accomplish that's so special? They obviously wracked their writers brains to the point of mediocrity to settle for this very cheap excuse to combine all the different movie Spider-Mans in one movie apparently for the sake of novelty, because the story serves absolutely no purpose, AND it just resets everything for Tom Holland's Spider-Man, which makes the previous 2 films really inconsequential, on top of creating a dilemma for any future possibilities of featuring all of those villains we've now just seen, which technically Tom Holland could have had versions of in his own franchise. This film was a waste of time, and one of the very worst in the entire Marvel series. In my opinion, everyone involved in coming up with this concept should be fired.", "Boring movie": "This has got to be the worse ever spiderman \ud83d\ude2b got bored after an hour lost interest my husband enjoyed though Shame they didn't have a 0 button \ud83d\ude15 because I would have scored 0 instead of 1.", "No way this is a 10": "If this is a 10 my pants are an 11.It seems The sheeple have come out mob handed and given the worst Spiderman of the lot a near 9 rating??.. so this plotless madness is rated as one of the best movies ever made. No way!!!. At best it's a 4 and that's being kind.Poor dialogue, poor jokes and completely disconnected.", "SPIDER-MAN 3...": "This film... it's going to be the topic of every conversation for the years to come.Obviously, we all kinda expected what was going to happen in this movie.Yet, we all wanted to see it with our own eyes.And it did happen:\nTHREE SPIDER-MAN'S! That were brought together in the same universe after Dr. Strange erroneously cast a dangerous spell.(We needed an excuse for this to happen, of course)\nMy personal review here:\nI'll be honest, I never was much of a fan of Holland's Spider-Man. The reason I went to see this film was because my inner child needed to see with his own eyes, the possibility of Tobey and Andrew coming back.And, yes. I cried like a baby the moment I watched the Spider-Man from my childhood meeting the Spider-Man from my adolescence.This was VERY beautiful to watch.For a second I even sobbed.But then... something was left.It felt as if the writers did not know what to do with the three \"Spider-Men\" after putting them all together.After that huge moment, that made us all scream and clap, it didn't take long till the dialogue started to feel dumb, with fan service jokes or even about their own movies as Spider-Man.Like, \"yeah, you are the second one\".The moment I saw Tobey, Andrew and Tom together, I thought:\n\"Oh my god, this is going to be epic af\"\n\"This will probably be the most important film of our generation\".But, by the end of the third act, I realized:\nThey did it again...\nThey took the characters we've loved since we were kids to put them in a millionaire project with a really bad script.Repeating Raimi's mistake. They put so many villains that they didn't know what to do with them, not even with three Spider-Man's.The movie started to feel rushed after that. Causing plot holes, lack of emotions or a good dialogue between each Spider-Man and the enemy from his own universe.(Tobey Maguire sees Norman Osborn ALIVE again and he doesn't say a word to him?)\n(Tobey Maguire sees Otto Octavius ALIVE again and they only exchange two words as if they had seen each other at Home Depot)\nThey gave us a cheapie 20 minute fight where they must \"cure\" every single villain with a magical injection? With barely any good or lasting scenes from each Spider-Man.Not to mention the horrific way Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield just \"vanished\", going back to their respective universes.The movie only lasts two hours and a half. Would it have been so difficult to add 30 more minutes of the three Spider-Man's in action?We barely saw Maguire or Garfield fighting or do anything else before that terrible goodbye.And by the way, what happened to Tobey Maguire? And I'm not talking about his age, I'm talking about how unexpressive and autistic he looks and talks in this movie.Was that scripted?My final words in this review:\nSeeing the old Spider-Man's on the big screen again was something too beautiful, but it wasn't \"epic\".But it could have been.It could've been the most glorious movie we ever saw in our lives...\nBut, the film industry does not focus on good stories nowadays.", "How The Dark Knight is for DC, that's how Spiderman No Way Home is for Marvel.": "NO SPOILERS!Everything that has been previously built has led up to this and tens to hundreds of theories have been speculated and lo and behold, this is so much better than Endgame. Though most of the theories aren't true, but it's impressive to witness the fact that it lives up to all the hype. Sheer madness!Without spoiling anything, No Way Home opens umpteenth of possibilities for new plots and world-building in that the next Spiderman trilogy or Marvel films, anything and everything can happen or exist beyond a shadow of a doubt.Mystical and mysterious, this most anticipated film of the year provides a plot that is rarely seen in the superhero cinematic landscape. It's exciting, refreshing and breaking new grounds insofar that it's unpredictable as it keeps on searching for new angles to entice both the old and new generations.People may get disconnected with the plot because it involves time and magic. However, what's so great about No Way Home is in the friendly tone and weight that they present to the audience, making it easy to understand even coming from someone who is not a huge fan of superhero films.Tom Holland powerfully brings everything here to the table. His range of acting and emotional skills has improved tremendously since the predecessor. Even for someone who despises him, you'll be knocking yourself off your feet in no time!Compared to other origin films that opts for typical storytelling, No Way Home attempts to balance humor, drama and action all in one movie and oh my, how it succeeds at that is just one huge jaw-dropping spectacle.As revealed in the trailer, there are plenty of villains await and everyone has a screentime just or almost as much as the others. No one is in the spotlight too little or too much, resulting in an appropriate amount of sheer greatness to introduce back all the bad guys.There are a lot of jokes to spot in this film. However, some of them offer subtlety and puns that you can see it coming only by the help of your own experience and intelligence. Only when you see the film, you'll understand what I'm saying.Never have I seen such a beautiful but haunting ending before. I don't wanna say much here but the ending alone is a masterpiece that it feels like it's coming from an Oscar-worthy film and I'm not exaggerating even one bit.The one thing I dislike here with No Way Home is its cheesiness during the first half. It projects this parody-like vibe that somehow takes us out of the experience a little bit. Even I get a tingling sense that the cameras are just too lazy to shoot the movie.The 2 post-credits scenes are good and exciting but I feel like it doesn't live the hype to all the existing theories on the web. Good but nothing shocking.Verdict: Within 150 minutes, Spiderman No Way Home offers a rollercoaster ride of a thousand of emotions, similar to Infinity War & Endgame and it is definitely the best Marvel origin stand-alone film to date.", "Holly Spider-Man": "Very enjoyable, easy to watch, the film flys by its so hard to write a proper review without spoilers . For me the star of the film was William Defoe he changed his whole face as the Green Goblin took over him. Love the interaction with the villains.Please stay for the mid and end credit scene .", "Epic and satisfying Spider Man movie ever with action and surprises.": "5 out of 5 stars.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic, big, and one of the best Spider Man films of all time. Literally nothing is holding this film back which the script contains about everything. And director Jon Watts making the best spider man movie ever. Fans and non fans are going to love the film. The story is best to go without any spoilers. There are many surprises that will leave the crowd cheering. Story also goes into an emotional direction and making the film feeling like a conclusion to the trilogy. Characters story arcs coming to an end. While opening up more possibilities to where the direction can go.No Way Home does the third film of concluding the story right unlike Amazing Spider man movie or the original third film where they cram up so many villains and a story that can barely hold it together. No Way Home script managed to balance the story and characters out. This film does have several villains. A lot of returning villains that is a lot of fun surprises and even with a new look. Peter Parker facing each one of them and trying to stop them is awesome. The plot is great. It can try to go in a emotional direction. There is also a fun brief appearance of another character which is cool to see and hoping to see more of them in future mcu films someday.The action sequences are awesome and stylistic. Spider man fight scenes are amazing. The visual effects are brilliant. The cinematography is well done in capturing the action scenes. The music score is different by Michael Giacchino but great. The cast ensemble did a great job. Like I said earlier, the appearances making a return is a lot of fun. For a long run time, the film does feel short and very fast moving which keeps your eyes glued to the screen.The climax battle is epic and exciting. Spider Man facing multiple villains is one of the best action scenes ever. It can be a bit dark. The action scene with Spider Man and Doctor Strange chasing each other through the mirror dimension is stunning.Overall, No Way Home is one of the best Marvel films ever. And one of the best Spider man movies. It is big, epic, and the script and direction had a lot of surprises. I am hoping to see Jon Watts take on another Marvel project.There is a fun mid credit scene that hints for where the direction can go. And a post credit scene that hints of where mcu is going next.", "good all around": "It's immediately after the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Spider-Man (Tom Holland) had been framed by Mysterio who also revealed his true identity, Peter Parker. He and his friends, MJ (Zendaya) and Ned (Jacob Batalon), are hounded by the media, demonized by many, and investigated by the authorities. Frustrated with his situation, he asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to do a spell.This Spider group is a fun group. I love this young group and then there are the veterans. It's a great way to reincorporate the previous Spider-verses and the bonus is getting all these great veteran actors. They are all great at delivering complex characters. There is a bit of redemption for some who ended the previous versions on a down note. This is a good movie by itself as well as a good progression for the MCU.", "Its an ok superhero movie": "It's an ok movie. Some of the cgi scenes feels cheap, but the more realistic scenes are good.The movie Is a little bit long for It's own good.It could have been cut down 30min without hurting the movie. Its Nice to see a clever spin to connect every movie made. Smart move.Before they felt like meaningless sequels in their own spiderverse.", "Absolutely BRILLIANT": "Great storyline, absolutely loaded with an ALL STAR CAST. It was amazing to see all the villains from the previous movies return and the chemistry between Toby, Andrew and Tom was not only hilarious but genuine and fantastic. They really listened to the fans on the one. Toby and Andrew have much bigger parts than I expected which made this movie for me. When they showed up in the movie the cinema absolutely erupted. It was a very special moment - one guy in my row was crying. Not to mention Dr Strange is not only brilliant in this movie but also has a huge part himself. This is quite possibly the best Marvel to date.", "getting tired of cgi overload situations": "Maybe if i seen it in imax theater i been more appreciative.I thought it was infantile in its dialogues and ways DR Strange deal with all this until it get so the end.Its a blockbuster . Big budget.Kids and young teens will probably adore.", "My favorite Spiderman movie!": "This was just perfect. It borders on Endgame for my all time favorite Marvel movie. This is how you do nostalgia right. What are you doing still reading reviews about this movie, go and watch it already!", "Everything I wanted and more": "Wow what a ride and such an experience. As a big Spider-Man fan I got a surprising few things from this movie too. First of all they stuck with the villains stories no matter the reception they got on the previous films they stuck with it and that's honestly so respectful. To see not all of them actually be villains because Peter is trying to help them from themselves by not dying was the Spider-Man I have been hoping to see from Tom Holland which I didn't feel in the other movies. Green Goblin is easily the most terrifying how he pretends to be on Peters side and tries to manipulate Peter and May. Lizard wasn't in it much but hey he was still good in the movie. Sandman was awesome, he protected Peter from Electro after the events of Spider-Man 3 and just wanted to be with his daughter. Electro was fun and fresh too with his new look and the visuals. Doc Ock obviously amazing and to hear the call backs to Spider-Man 2, so happy they didn't make him a villain and he actually helped them. Second of all Aunt May being Peters \"Uncle Ben\" was amazing, she delivered the line perfectly and she was just great especially since we had more screen time with her in these movies than we did with Ben in the others. Thirdly Matt Murdock! Are you kidding me! A very small part but wow it's good to see him again looking great and I can't wait to see what they do with that character. Fourthly Andrew and Tobey of course... Andrew coming through that portal and being not quite sure if it was him until he came forward was unreal everyone went mad in the cinema (Same with Tobey) he is still great after years, Tobey amazing too they just hold a special place in a lot of peoples hearts and their interactions with the characters especially Peter (Toms) Just very impactful and maybe they will come back who knows. 5th point is that in the portal coming through we saw Kraven and a Rhino variant and I wanted them to come but who knows... overall they ended the film great with the villains not having to die. Final points I'll say is that Green Goblin vs Peter was pretty brutal, it was intense and Tobey stopping Peter from killing him was just so perfect. My last final point is that ending... Peter having to leave everything behind to keep them safe was the Spider-Man we all know and love. Him getting an apartment struggling to get by and being Spider-Man still with a comic accurate suit and not an iron spider suit. This is the Spider-Man I have wanted and I can't wait to see what they will do. The ending made me think of the game for the PS4/5 and if they go down that route of tone and stuff then this could be some of the best Spider-Man movies coming up. No gadgets, just Spider-Man and Peter Parker being their natural selves and the heroes we all love. Overall this film is something else and I'm glad I was there to see it, it's a good laugh, it's a good thrill and it's Spider-Man. Thank you to everyone who made this film!", "Very entertaining, but lacking originality": "A good all round superhero action film with great special effects and cast of characters. The way it brings together the multiverse does allow for some entertaining surprises, but the lack of a new or single villain as well as the seeming invulnerability of the hero does negatively impact the tension. There's a good amount of humour and drama, but little stands out as truly great in this 'greatest hits' compilation.", "my opinion": "Wow, the greatest movie after Avengers End Game. Thank you, Marvel, and thank you, Sony. Comedy, drama, romance and enthusiasm are all present in this movie. The ending is very, very sad.", "The best Spider-Man movie...": "\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is an Action - Fantasy movie and the third movie of the \"Spider-Man\" franchise, in which we follow the story of Spider-Man after \"Spider-Man: Far from Home\". Everybody knows the true identity of Spider-Man and Doctor Strange can help Peter with a spell. Everything change when this spell goes wrong.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an amazing plot, contained plenty of action scenes and much of suspense. Regarding the plot, there were some plot twists that I did not expect so, it was a nice surprise and something that made the movie even more interesting and enjoyable. The direction which was made by Jon Watts was very good and he used wisely both information and characters to create this special movie. The interpretations of Tom Holland who played as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Alfred Molina who played as Dr. Otto Octavius / Doc Ock, Benedict Cumberbatch who played as Doctor Strange and Willem Dafoe who played as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin were simply fantastic and their combination worked very well and created an outstanding result. All in all, I have to say that \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is one of the best Marvel movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.", "History is made": "I don't know when again in a future Marvel movie would we have something as historic as this. The story flows so well and it's extremely funny, sad and cool all at the same time.Can't wait to watch it again!!", "Some exec saw that 4 pointing Spiderman meme": "And decided to make a movie about it.That's about it. Make up an excuse to get all the previous actors who played Spiderman, Andrew and Tobey and write up a story to get them together.It's a terrible concept and doesn't work. Just from the initial phase of Tom distracting Dr Strange during one of his spells, 5x, ugh. It's annoying. The action is sub par and the dialogue is fit for teenagers.Then stretch it out to 2.5 hours as Dafoe has to get his acting scenes in and be the lead villian. This is just a fail all around guys, no other way to put it.", "Spectacular and amazing but not a complete homerun": "Updated with spoilers:\nThis is the spider-man movie to see. This is the love child of the entire MCU. The action is fantastic, everything is great, and there is so many brilliant callbacks and wonderful nostalgia mixed with love, emotions and great acting. For the first 40min or so this is one of the best superhero movies ever made, with Daredevil cameo as the top of the line - and I loved this move, however it has a few errors that lower the score and the longer the movie goes the less I enjoyed it which is kinda strange since the ending is spectacular and Amazing.The CGI is not always on point. Those computer graphic misses stod out was because it is excellent otherwise, so kinda weird with a few misses. I think the Sandman was badly done and The Lizard was a joke. I also seriously dislike Peter decision to try to save everyone and the fight with Strange. That is where the movie almost lost me. And these are clearly evil people, and they died in their respective universe. But okay, the plot does need to happen... The worst thing though is why them? In all the universes, of all the people that know who Peter is, these are the ones coming through? Why not 97 of Uncle Ben's? That would make more sense. My final complaint is that all that comes before comes to Peter is now erased, which is fine and a great hero sacrifice, but it also create issues with continuity and storylines.The great awesomeness is all the rest. The music score is amazing, best since Captain Marvel (which, no matter what you thought of that movie, has the best original score of any superhero movie). And the Flashpoint? Haha.. great stuff. The action is spectacular, the script amazing, all the actors do an fantastic job with Willem Dafoe probably stealing the acting crown. Two end-credit scenes, although I heard some saw a long \"trailer\", which I did not see so felt that was kinda weird, perhaps only in some theatres? The first meh, kinda cool I guess. The second about something I care nothing about with a character I care absolutely nothing about so kinda disappointing to me. I am not going to see Dr Strange II, I really dislike Wanda and I dislike Elizabeth Olsen portrait of her even less. That TV show was the worst I have ever seen, except for Batwoman.. nothing is worse than Batwoman... That Strange movie will suck.Despite my criticism this movie is together with the current running Hawkeye show (which is fantastic) I feel like the MCU is still alive and kicking. And with Daredevil and Kingpin now part of the MCU, can be worse for sure. This movie really take hold of you and give you that magic which the best superhero movies do. I would rank this as the second best Spider-Man movie and top 10 for sure within the MCU. 8/10 and I highly recommend.", "It's a movie for the fans!": "This movie is filled with a lot of fans moments!Even for memers!Some say it's not enough... But personally for me, it was more than enough!It was like being served the dessert you've been waiting for!If you are a fan, just go and watch it! Don't wait for spoilers! But take sanitary precautions during this covid time!", "A Spider CU's Messy Fan Feast.": "Aside from the rushed \"pre-paid\" 10s and 9s, the quality of the film should not mainly be based on the stunning visuals but also on the plot, screenplay and acting skills which clearly fails to hold itself together.Starting with the \"Only in Theaters\" bs, which I feel is quite outdated, pretty much like the suits behind the industry itself, to ancient that they don't know we are living in the digital era as the new way of life! Why force people to either free stream or the typical silliness of the theater experience, being stuck among people talking, phones peeping, bad seats, extremely loud sound, unable to pause or rewind...etc.Not to mention the contagious threat when you can enjoy your experience wherever you wish digitally! The only reason I see it is for the rich company to get more rich. The option for digitally streaming and theaters should be available from day 1.About the movie itself...Playing on being a Spidey's CU fan fest with the multiverse concept the film can hold itself for being interesting yet it can't hide the fact that the plot is forced and the directing is average with lots of moderate fighting scenes.Silly as it may sound but if you only saw any trailer you practically have seen most of the film by now. The plot is messy and forced and the screenplay feels inconsistent and awkward at points, mainly to force lead the plot into the multiverse situation, don't get me wrong, I do respect the homage and as a matter of fact most of my rating is based on it but my eyes never glow whenever I see a rendered 3D scene like most, the human factor play a lot in my count.", "YES YES YES": "The most satisfying way to end a trilogy. This movie is chef's kiss to all marvel fans. I was laughing crying and smiling at the same time.

In order to reverse his publicity as Peter Park, he enlists the help of Dr. Strange played Benedict Cumberbatch. The spell doesn't work exactly as planned and opens a window into alternative universes that collide all the villains and Spider-Man's together much like Spider-man Into the Spider-verse. William Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church revise their mischievous ways but Holland's version of our friendly neighborhood spider-man uses Stark's technology to help each one from being killed from their own universes. Tom, Zendaya and Jacob bring together the other Spider-man reprised by Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire. Marisa Tomei added a level of support, love and emotion to the point that we all cherish. The story showed a unique perspective of Spider-man that we haven't seen in any of the other films. I loved this one, one of my favorite Marvel movies ever, it was filled with empathy, adventure, pure emotional ride. I could watch this one over and over again. Add this one to your library.", "Spectacular.": "Where to begin? I would find it extremely difficult for any Spider-Man fan to dislike this film. What's amazing is the feat that Jon Watts, Kevin Feige, Amy Pascal and others accomplished here.Let me just say the the plot has a lot of mumbo jumbo, comic-book logic that typically most comic fans can get on board with including myself, but because the MCU has built enough trust with everyone, you just kinda go with it. Even if you don't, the magic of all these actors and legacy characters returning for this dazzling spectacle will kinda make you forgive it.Lets also just get this out of the way. It was the worst kept secret that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were appearing alongside Tom Holland. The consensus on this was pretty much acknowledged to almost every fanboy, fangirl and most casual fans too. Also the return of Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx's Electro, Thomas Haden Church's Sandman and Rhys Ifans' Lizard made it more apparent. It's just a marvel(pun intended) that Sony and Marvel/Disney were able to bring everyone back. Never would I have thought it was possible.The villains are a lot more poignant and prominent than I thought they would be. Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe are THE MVPs of the bunch. Dafoe is used to great effect and is as menacing as I remember him and Molina commands the screen with his presence and delivery. They still feel very much in tune with what Sam Raimi did. Jamie Foxx has a second chance with Electro and it works a lot more now than it did since the last time we saw him in 2014. Unfortunately Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans are the benchwarmers of the villains. BUT, used to some capacity where they don't feel totally left out.Now lets talk about the Spider-Men.TOM HOLLAND: I think Marvel Studios and Sony either had this planned all along or they heard the fans and listened. What I loved about Holland/MCU's iteration is that he is kid who brings his exciting energy and youthful enthusiasm to the Avengers. Also as fan of Spidey comics, particularly the Ultimate Spider-Man series, I feel most of the best stories is when he's a teenager in high school. So I got what I wanted in that regard, however my criticism of his portrayal is that he was basically Iron Man Jr. With a lot of Stark tech. But here, they strip him down, beat him to a pulp, he loses his Aunt May, makes sacrifices and learns from his mistakes. He finally learns and understands with the help of Tobey and Andrew providing their wisdom. I think finally we are going to get the Spider-Man that we hoped he would grow into. It is Holland's best performance as the character by far.ANDREW GARFIELD: Jon Watts and his writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers redeem him. Not that his portrayal was bad, because personally I always found Garfield's Spider-Man the most accurate of the bunch and there are some things to like about the Marc Webb films. Garfield gets the closure he needed as his movies ended abruptly after the 2014 sequel. Every moment he has where he shares his experience with Holland and Maguire on screen is a major highlight. Especially when he talks about Gwen Stacy. He also has a nice moment where he saves Zendaya's MJ, mirroring the fact that he never got to save Gwen. Garfield absolutely crushed it and displayed his amazing acting chops.TOBEY MAGUIRE: For many, including myself Tobey Maguire is the OG. Growing up with his Spider-Man films, words can't really describe the emotions I felt seeing him back. I was practically reliving my childhood the minute he appeared. It was all coming back to me, being on the hype train during his era of films and just obsessing over the Sam Raimi films, it just brought me back. I truly felt like a kid again. Tobey's presence in the film feels very much like the older brother of the group and he bounces off Holland and Garfield seamlessly. It's been a hot minute seeing Tobey on the big screen since PAWN SACRIFICE(good movie by the way) and he hasn't lost a step.Once Garfield and Maguire appear, all three share the limelight as co-leads and not a single one of them feel left out.As for the rest of the cast. Benedict Cumberbatch always commands your attention. I was initially turned off of the idea of having Holland's Spidey have another mentor like figure, but here Strange and Spidey are at odds on how to handle their problem after the botched spell. So that was a nice surprise in the marketing and in the film. Marisa Tomei has way more to do in this film than the previous films and has an emotional send off with her death. Zendaya's MJ has grown on me since FAR FROM HOME and Jacob Batalon's Ned is less annoying here which I appreciated.Piggy backing off that, I did admire that Watts aimed for a more mature tone throughout the film. As I get older I do crave that serious tone a bit more and I savor it every time it is present. I mean yes the standard formulaic humor is still present, but I appreciated every moment where things got serious.I love the MCU and I'm always there to watch their product, but I can be honest and say that at times, they are like comfort food. I know what I'm getting and I know I'll enjoy it. I also haven't been shy of the films I've really disliked, but they have been consistent as a whole. However, when they either take big swings or assemble(pun intended) a film with a more mature tone, every so often we'll get absolute gems like the first IRON MAN, the CAPTAIN AMERICA trilogy, the first AVENGERS, the first GUARDIANS, and INFINITY WAR. I'm extremely pleased that SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME belongs with those gems. Should Sony and Marvel/Disney keep working together I look forward to more adventures as the Spider-Man I wanted Tom Holland to be. I would also be lying to you if I didn't crave more of Garfield and Maguire. Anything is possible nowadays as we even got a Charlie Cox's Daredevil cameo, which was also heavily speculated and if you've been keeping up with HAWKEYE, you know we're in for a treat.While the story can be cluttered, the film drives it home with the development of Holland's Spider-Man, some excellent performances, and fan service with a purpose. Definitely the best MCU Spider-Man film, one of my favorite MCU entries as a whole, and in the conversation of one of the best Spidey films with Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 2 and INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE.9.5/10.", "Messy but emotional": "NO SPOILERS - The first act is a mess saved by some familiar faces and one or two funny scenes. However, with the first emotional event of the film, everything changes. First, with a lot of fan service and some weird changes on the tone (I still don't get how MCU wants everybody to move from crying a lot to laughing hard in the next minute), but always growing to a very strong third act on an epic battle (even if slightly confusing).There are problems. The fan service - already mentioned - is simply too much. It's not only what you are thinking. It's remembering all the single moments you can imagine, it's in a lot of dialogue, lots of lines and mostly is there only to tell you \"hey, I'm here, remember?\". But what works mainly as a gimmick supports a very good emotional arc, which happens for the first time on this trilogy. This also helps Holland and Zendaya, who are now better actors and have time to show what they can bring to the table.It's not a perfect film. It's still behind the first two of Maguire but I hope they can keep on this way.PS: The humour is still an issue, but a bit less than on the previous ones.", "Just see it!": "10/10Excellent cast, interesting battles & lots of fun.This is the grown up third movie. Whereas the first two felt like teen movies.I do not want to spoil anything here. Go and see it!", "Overhyped and Overrated": "Not a terrible movie. But it is the most overhyped and overrated film in the last year. Enjoyable but probably won't watch it again. Think it's time to stop all these marvel films and tv shows it's draining the life out of them.", "I Literally Lost Two Hours of My Life!!!": "After watching this version of Spider-Man, and I was just looking for some distraction, I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my life. The story was written for kids and strangely enough, it's teenagers and adults who are loving this movie. The screenplay is not all bad because it managed to bring all the villains and spider-men from the previous versions and comprise them in one movie but the plot is poor and childish.Marisa Tomei as Peter Parker's aunt is laughable, her acting and dialogues are naive, she seems misplaced in the movie. Tom Holland was a good catch for the role of Spider-Man other than that just another superhero boring story.", "Truly terrible!": "The 9/10 rating on here shows how manipulated these ratings are.This film was so boring and dragged out, and there was no point to any of it.So much cgi it was like watching a cartoon much of the time.If I'd not been with my daughter I'd have left half way through.I genuinely struggled to stay awake and felt angry at how bad it was by the end.Tom was great as always, but the film sucked.", "Believe the Hype": "I just wanted to scream throughout the entire film, watch this in a cinema because you won't regret it, the gasps of joy were audible throughout and this is easily in the top 5 cinematic experiences I've ever had. Now, I know nobody wants spoilers so without going into any detail whatsoever I just want to say, believe the hype because this exceeds it, usually I don't want to get people over excited for something but this has to be watched, it is 20 years of Spider-Man all put into one film that manages to feel like the perfect culmination of all that history, my only criticism is that there couldn't be a Stan Lee cameo because if he had still been with us today he would have loved this.", "Amazing Spider": "In the beginning I was thinking what the plot could be... combined with Doctor Strange and multiverse the result it's Amazing. Adventure, comedy, drama, special effects creates one of the best Spider movies!", "Spider-Man: No Way Home Delivers Epic Marvel Action And Plenty Of Surprises": "Life for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is complicated thanks to his dual life as Spider-Man and the challenges of being in High School. Unfortunately for him; his best intentions are about to make things much worse in \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\".Taking place where \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by Tabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.As if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.Desperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.Strange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).Strange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.As more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.What follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.The film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.The film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.While there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.There is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.", "MOST MEMORABLE EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD IN CINEMA..": "Spider man no way home is filled with old school memory, nostalgia, heart, action, adventure, high octane and action scenes, heartfelt and tearjacking emotions and most importantly pure fan service.. smnwh is one of the best superhero movie ever made and I'm saying this as a true DC fan, but i also love marvel..

Spider-Man No Way home became the biggest hype of the year 2021. In the end and I was personally expecting a dissapointment due to the weak performance of MCU in the last time, but No Way Home did way more than I expected. The movie full of nostalgic and emotional scenes. The movie that connects all the generations together and makes a perfect ending to all the three Spider-Man franchises. In the end, this is an another masterpiece from Marvel, with the best fighting scenes I've ever seen in my life, with the best Picture, the best CGI and the best acting so far. I loved The Spider-Men relationships and I have to say that all the three legendary actors (Tom Holland, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield) did a perfect job portraying their Spider-Men.", "You have no idea what this movie alone has accomplished. Setting everyone and everything off in the greatest way possible while delivering pure entertainment.": "The MCU Spider-Man has finally arrived. I had to take some time for this experience to sink in and assimilate what it alone has accomplished in a 2h runtime. Well done, Marvel, well done.For those who criticised this movie of having a \"pandering\" fan service or messy plot didn't quite understand the main purpose and theme of the movie. I am not excusing its possible filmmaking-related flaws, but it never set out to be flawless in the first place and I love that about it.This movie wasn't only about pleasing fans but it was also about providing Tom Holland's Spider-Man of the wake up call it so desperately needed. Everyone who criticised the MCU portrayal of Spider-Man has been proven wrong as the character has evolved and matured over the course of the movies to reach the portrayal we all know and love. Far From Home was a step in the right direction from Homecoming, but this one is the pinnacle of it all. I have to give it to screen writters and everyone creatively involved in the movie from a story perspective because they have outdone themselves. This movie, while not exempt of filmmaking flaws and contrivances, has delivered what we never thought we needed. Maybe it's me, maybe I'm blinded by the fact that any and all plot devices used in this movie are of my liking. In a world of magic and sci-fi, political disputes and spionage are rendered a bit underwhelming to me.About the fan service, this is fan service done right, because it services the story. The multiversal backdrop serves primarily for two things: redemption and realisation. I don't want to get into too much spoilers, but certain characters and emotional moments return to redeem characters who need redemption and for others to realise that actions have consequences. Something that we finally see in an MCU Spider-Man movie, something that ever since its comicbook conception in the 1970s has defined and established the character as one of the best in the industry.Like Dave Filoni said about Star Wars: \"It's not really about what we decorate it with (x-wings, lightsabers, aliens) but the familial conflicts, the emotional turmoil that defines Star Wars and sets it apart from the rest\". Spider-man is not what we decorate it with, is not only about the swinging, the villains, the crazy adventures, it's about the human element, it's about how these affect the Man in Spider-Man. I have always been more fascinated with the portions of the comic where we see internal struggle within Peter, when we see him fail, loose, suffer; because it makes the eventual triumph that much more spectacular.This movie single-handedly fixes whatever I saw was wrong with Tom Holland's Spiderman portrayal and elevated him to the stratosphere, leaving him off with a great prospect on what is to come. Not only that, but every character introduced is given enough moments to shine and takeaway something from this major event. Every single character that I wasn't quite sold on (from the principal ones I mean) have found a place to shine and show performances that enhances the movie, particularly Zendaya, Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina.It's one of the most daring MCU plots yet and it also manages to please all the cinematic Spider-Man fans at the same time. Whatever movie flaw it might have I have overlooked them as I do the rest of the MCU movies. These are not meant to revolutionise cinema, they are here to entertain, to provide interesting characters and stories and, sometimes even, to elevate and uplift us.IN CONCLUSION, I have no issues with this movie overall. I have some small nitpicks here and there, mostly to do with some of the comedy and side characters. But other than that, it sets out to do what it intended and, believe or not, serves as both conclusion to the MCU Spider-man and also transitioning movie to the stories to come. And I for one can not wait to see what's in store. If you are a Spider-Man fan you will love this movie because it does everything right, if you are a casual MCU fan you will be entertained and amused; and if you are a casual movie fan this movie might be a bit confusing. But then again, these are comicbook stories, I don't know what to tell you.", "\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" saves the best for last!": "This movie was incredibly amazing and beautiful and also action packed! \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" turned into the next Endgame, with one of the most surprising twists and turns. Not that this is Tom Holland's last Spider-Man movie, but this will be his best Spider-Man movie. No Way Home is one of the Best Marvel Superhero Movie of all time! No spoilers for this movie tho, but I can only say one thing that comes to mind. This movie is definitely \"A MUST SEE Superhero movie of the year!\" Thank you to Marvel and all the Spider-Man fans for making it happen!", "Possibly the Best Movie of the Year": "This movie has it all. I went through a wide range of emotions and all while having fun. There are no points at which I'm asking myself why did I watch this movie (or pay to). This is one of the only movies I will watch again from this year of cinematic rebuilding.", "The biggest and arguably best Spider-Man outing yet": "THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW!There's not much chance of devoted Spidey/Marvel fans walking away from Jon Watt's and Tom Holland's latest web-slinging adventure without a strong sense of satisfaction from an epic outing, that in many ways feels as grand and risky as when the world first wondered how Marvel would manage to bring The Avengers to life all the way back in 2012.The third trip between director Watt's and his leading man, that sees the groundwork laid before it combine here in a loaded and fan servicing collaboration, to talk about No Way Home without giving away its many narrative treasures and likely iconic pop culture moments is a difficult task but there's reason to believe even early on in its release that this Spider-Man outing will go down as one of, if not the best big screen solo outings for the local neighborhood vigilante yet.As is always the case with such loaded Marvel outings, there are a few narrative conveniences that don't hold up to much examination and a few half-explored ideas but too dwell on these moments would be a waste of ones time when there's so much joy, fun and even unexcepted emotion to be found in Watt's film as Parker and his offsiders find themselves battling a severe multiverse problem that threatens to derail the world as we know it.Filled with an abundance of action set pieces, well-known Marvel comedic beats, more throwbacks and nods to lore than almost any other Marvel film before it and fun character interactions, what is perhaps most surprising of all about this high reaching adventure is the wealth of strong performances found within it from one of the most stacked casts the long running superhero brand has seen yet.From the expected and unexpected cast additions, everyone here brings their A-game with Holland and Zendaya as the loving couple getting great moments together and feeling well and truly like they've both become their respective characters in body and soul, while other returning cast members from both recent and less recent times all appear to care more than just a paycheck collection would suggest giving No Way Home a strong sense of purpose and heart, with the small moments making more of an impact than the films various action oriented segments.Likely to be a film that is explored multiple times and one that is sure to provide hidden moments of joy and satisfaction to those that delve back into it across the ensuing years, No Way Home is another groundbreaking achievement from Marvel who could've easily sat back and enjoyed their success after the events of Endgame but have continued to push the boundaries of blockbuster movie making as they keep looking to provide us with top notch entertainment that is undeniable and unmatched in quality.Final Say -There's no doubt about the fact that Spider-Man: No Way Home is the biggest and arguably best Spider-Man outing yet. A stunning achievement in pushing forward while also acknowledging the past, things here might not be perfect but there's too much to like here to deny that Marvel has once more raised the bar for the comic book cinematic landscape.4 imprisoned trees out of 5Check out my film blog Jordan and Eddie for more reviews!", "Simply put, a masterpiece": "A perfect bridge between the previous mcu Spider-Man style and the more traditional style of Spider-Man story. The movie is devistating but that's what makes it a great story. Not just fanservice, everything has a purpose. Best superhero movie of all time and I think it's my favorite movie ever.", "Tries really hard, but only reminds of better Spiderman films": "After the animated Spider-Man - Into the Spider-Verse, it was an incredibly smart business move by Sony to attempt something similar with their new Spider-Man movie. And considering the mammoth task of juggling so many characters, the overall storyline isn't bad. This could have easily been a far less focused movie tripping all over itself. However, No Way Home trips over something, that isn't its own fault:\nThe Tom Holland Spider-Man films and universe are just not very interesting. Tom Holland is an okay actor, but his tenure has suffered by having been shoehorned into the other Marvel films, never having had an origin story or even much in terms of character development or motivation.Does anyone remember how his story even began? Everyone remembers Tobey Maguire's Spidey origin. You kind of remember Andrew Garfield's, even if it was almost the exact same story, just less interesting.Tom Holland is a bit of blank state. He does his wide eyed stare and overexcited fast talking thing, but is given very little to work with. Most of the Marvel movies had him on as comic relief, playing second or third fiddle to their mainstay characters.His own movies likewise got bogged down in \"bathos\" humor, constantly winking at the audience and having characters break character for Family Guy style self-referential humor or \"what is happening?\" moments. They were largely plot driven films instead of character driven like the Sam Raimi films.Both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield command the screen whenever they appear in this movie. They slip back into their roles like it was yesterday, and it truly makes me hope that Sony will be brave enough to continue their stories in their respective iterations and universes. Andrew Garfield's films suffered from poor script writing, lame villains and a botched attempt at starting a cinematic universe, but he is extremely charismatic and fun to watch. He almost steals the show here.Willem Dafoe and especially Alfred Molina are fantastic here as well, while Electro and Lizard are unnecessary in an already overpopulated roster. I'm glad they didn't throw Venom in as well (surely they were tempted to).One of the major problems here is that the villains have no relationship to Holland's protagonist, and they have little to no motivation to fight someone they never met. The script demands it though, since these Marvel movies need an action scene ever 20 minutes.The parts where characters are talking are actually a lot more interesting than the fighting scenes, which just grind the narrative to a halt to throw a bunch of noisy CGI crap at the screen. This is especially frustrating at the end, where a giant brawl breaks out for no reason whatsoever right in the middle of the heroes and villains actually negotiating.Zendaya and the comic relief kid are charisma vacuums, with Zendaya failing to act as any kind of emotional anchor to the plot, and the other guy failing to be funny. When they share the screen with the characters from the previous series, it becomes painfully obvious how outclassed they are. Maguire and Dunst shared real on screen chemistry, as did Garfield and Stone.In the end, the best this film has to offer is nostalgia and *hopefully* a path to resurrect the previous Spider-Man film series as Sony does their own thing, separate from the MCU. The MCU is pretty much grasping at straws at this point and burned out much of its audience with six subpar films (Eternals, Shang Chi, Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Far from Home and even Endgame, which was a major step down from Infinity War) and who knows how much terrible filler stuff on TV.Sony would do well to pick up where they left off. A 4th Raimi Spiderman with Maguire would be a box office hit.", "Great Movie!": "Could be the best Spider-Man movie...The actors in the movie were very good, the acting of Tom Holland and Andrew Garfield was great.I recommend you to watch, my rating is 10/10.", "The More Fun Stuff": "SCORE: 10/10Marvel is so special and I am constantly reminded of how lucky I am to have become such a big fan. If you don't like this movie, we can't be friends and I seriously question your judgement. Rewatching this again made me realize just how good it was and how well they handled the story, characters, and humor. This really was the More Fun Stuff and I am extremely happy with how they executed it, hopefully leaving more people satisfied than not. It didn't add too much to where we felt like we were cheated from the original, and they didn't add too little to make it not worth the rewatch. I was impressed at how they were able to bridge the gap on certain conversations and interactions from the original without overdoing it or making it feel out of place.Now for the movie itself. It's beautiful. Tom Holland's Spider-Man is able to make huge strides while Marvel introduced a concept that would change the course of film forever. 3 Spider-Men, in 3 different movies, across 3 different time period, all coming together in one movie that explains their ability to coexist. It still blows my mind at how seamless the stories blend and the talent of acting across the board from the heroes and villains. Endgame and Infinity War belong in their own category, but in a few years we will look back at this as the main catalyst for the mega-successes that The Kang Dynasty and Secret Wars will be.", "Pretty Amazing if you've seen all the previous Spider-Man movies": "There's too many characters in here but that doesn't mean they're a bad thing, most of them were already developed from the previous Spider-Man movies, this movie just focuses mostly on Tom Holland's Peter's development and some villains with motive that's simple.I like how it mostly focused on Peter's story arc, Some reunited characters had also their own arcs but it's too little compare to Peter's.His character arc is building since the Homecoming movie, The movie ends with Peter living in a apartment with no Stark gadgets but just his own self. Back to basics.The movie is also well paced, It's a 2 hour 30 minutes movie but you won't get bored, You just can't take your eyes away from the screen from how amazing it is.", "I'm NOT the target audience for this film": "I am not the target audience. I don't mind Marvel films, I don't even mind comics, but I don't obsess over them in the way some people do (and it is fine that they get enjoyment from these films). This review is for people like myself, if you're a fan of Marvel and Spiderman then - simply put - you will love the film.For me, I found I was bored. The running time is long, the story is a little \"meh\" (Spiderman wants to SAVE the villains) and everything is just a little too convenient with plot points coming that are obvious from the get go. In short: It's a cookie-cut film. Marvel has their formula (and clearly it works for them) and they won't stray from that. Sorry, but I am in Ridley Scott's camp. There's no originality anymore.By now you probably already know that other faces do pop up in the film. There are some fun scenes with these characters and I chuckled a couple of times but - the rest of the audience was whooping, cheering and clapping which actually bugged me more as - it meant I missed a lot of dialogue after a character's reveal. Seriously, if you want to chat loudly - stay at home and watch the film instead of forcing others to listen to your inane thoughts.Tom Holland is good as Spiderman and, in this film, he shows a lot of range with his emotion - which was great to see because, until this film, we hadn't really seen that from him but, really, he is the only positive I can think of when it comes to this film. By tomorrow, I would have forgotten most of what I'd just watched.It's average at best. If you're a fan boy, it's the best Marvel film yet. Only you know which camp you belong in (and again, either camp is fine).", "A Full Spidey Fan Service": "No Way Home is undeniably the most emotional and the most entertaining of Tom Holland's Spider-Man. It's a full Spidey Fan Service for sure. While in Homecoming and Far From Home, Peter Parker's character felt quite childish, this film would show the transititon of a more grown-up Peter Parker, and Tom Holland did really well for making it happen. Of course No Way Home has many surprises that I won't spoil, but don't expect too much on storyline. The plot is pretty simple actually, and the trailer had already shown almost all the plot. So don't be spoiled if you wanted to have fun watching Spider-Man No Way Home, because the surprise elements are the key of this film.", "Weak story plot": "It's sad to see so many people including my favorite movie review YouTubers were out of his professional and give hign rating due to nostalgia but failing to see the weak story plot .Director can't handle messy fight scene and unrealistic cgi.. Kindergarten story , most part not logical. Dr strange not in his usual self as he say early he will sacrifice iron man to save the universe and still overlook this and help peter Parker. Ned easily open port while Dr strange train hard to open it. Every 5 min must put in lame joke such as Nel grandma part. Not even funny as it's kill the touching emotional part when both came in. Saving Mj part look too easy and fast ,should put slowmo and flashback like last time Andrew scene. Willem Dafoe nail the whole show with his performance. Should let Kelvin Fergie and Russo bros take charge. Can feel Andrew Garfield naturally like spiderman role a lot in this movie, he deserves part 3 for the role.", "Tom Holland is finally... Spiderman!!": "This film is a love letter to both Peter and Spidey, packed with every little thing that a spiderman movie needs...\nIt finally shows us Peter's selflessness, his desire to have everything, and the eventual acceptance that he can't. He learns and grows and changes so much. FINALLY FEELING LIKE HE IS HIS OWN PERSON!Tom Holland is finally... Spiderman!!", "boring": "After a long wait, in short, it was not worth seeing\nI was expecting a more interesting and exciting scenario, but it did not happen. There were not even interesting science fiction scenes.", "Story-wise decent, but the nostalgia makes this movie a real treasure": "\"Spider Man: No Way Home\" (not the best title) is, as you knew already from the title, one of the most recent Marvel movies out there. With the Avengers films over after the Thanos battle, pretty much every character is about to find closure in a way. Oh well, what you saw at the end of the most recent Thor film does not indicate that, but the final sequence with Tom Hardy here is not as much of an introduction to a fourth Spider-Man film, so it will maybe stay at three. The music you heard with the closing credits was also fairly fitting from this perspective. Of course, it is also a great connection to the three Spideys from this film here, but I will get to that a little later. Let's look at the basics first: The director is Jon Watts and he was also in charge of the previous two Spider-Man movies. Same is true for the two writers. It is not a surprise that they got chosen too for this one, but the real surprise was maybe that they got picked for the first film five years ago maybe as they were not really famous. Then again, these Marvel films rarely go for the truly defining filmmakers of our generation, but get in some new blood instead most of the time. Just like this trilogy here. The director worked on several Fatboy Slim music videos in the past and the two writers McKenna and Sommers collaborated on American Dad, which is both pretty cool. As for the cast, you will find a handful names from the previous films, obviously Tom Holland in the lead and also Zendaya who is really cruising right now with her roles here and in Dune. Jacob Batalon looks much more manly in real than in this film where he plays a nerdy character. Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange is really in every Marvel movie these days, which shows how popular he is. Benedict Wong I definitely appreciate here too as always. I like his character a lot, but sadly he does not have a lot of screen time here. Marisa Tomei is also back and she plays the youngest Aunt May you will probably ever come across. Still interesting that she is the only Oscar winner from the original cast here. They brought in another one with an Academy Award, but more about him in a second.The certainly most memorable aspect about this film here is how they used the multiverse idea to include the Spider-Man characters of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire despite how long ago it was for them to portray the character. Well, mostly for Maguire, but it was so cool to see them reprise their roles and the entire idea that they are still Spider-Man and always will be. No matter how much time passes. Of course, I am a little biased here because I adored the Sam Raimi movies back then, at least the first two, and I also quite like Andrew Garfield as an actor. I guess I will always rate these two above Tom Holland who I have disliked for a while, but he has grown a bit on me here admittedly and I will wait with my final judgement until I have checked out his previous two Spider-Man outings. As for the other two, they did not come alone, which adds even more awesomeness. We also get the key antagonists from their movies again. This includes Jamie Foxx, the other Oscar winner I mentioned early on and Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church, even if the latter two did not get featured too much. But Alfred Molina as Doc Ock and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn were and this was utterly amazing because I love the two characters and also so enjoyed their performances back then and now again in this film. What a blast this was and this is a key reason why I give this film a really enthusiastic recommendation and not just a solid one. I think Doc Ock was the one who we saw first in here in terms of the antagonists they brought back. They all had really cool introductions. Also interesting references about how they do not know about their own deaths, but talk about others' before they realize the gruesome truth. When they were there locked in these chambers, they almost felt like dogs. Dogs that once bit somebody, did something awful, but the protagonist tries to bring them and their hurt souls back and have them live lives as normal human beings without evil taking over.Dr. Strange is not happy about this idea at all and he even follows and fights Spidey over it. He sure could not be kept inside this chamber for long, but spider webs were more effective on one occasion. This role has turned Cumberbatch into an actor who is easier to like for me now after really struggling with him on Sherlock and also on The Power of the Dog very recently, a film that did not impress me one bit. But back to this one here: Strange is of course also the connection to the multiverse once again and with the latter I also keep struggling a bit at times, but here it was alright overall I guess. I remember his comment that they know almost nothing about the multiverse, haven't explored the way it works at all. I second that. Comedy is of course also something you always find in Marvel films and this one here is no exception. Unfortunately, they cannot get in the Stan Lee cameos anymore, but those were never really funny anyway, more like cult. Funny moments here include Strange's reaction when he finds out that Spidey has not even tried to talk to the people from MIT after he and his buddies got rejected. But yeah, I guess saving this woman's life there helped with that then. For me personally, it was very funny when the three Spider-Mans compared their \"web activities\" and certain techniques that the characters had in their films that differed from each other. Like how Maguire's had basically an endless stack of webs and Garfield's character had to literally create his in a lab or something which was exhausting. I guess this was where the superhero aspect already moved a bit aside for science as Garfield's was then a bit more of a Batman approach.What else felt funny? Oh yes, how they encourage each other, especially Garfield's character when they call each other amazing. Like \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". Another charming reference there back to the books and the original title. I could really go on and on here with the moments that will make you smile or maybe even laugh, but I will leave it at that. In any case, the film was also a triumph from this perspective. And I would not say this is a given because I have been critical at times with comedy in Marvel movies and I am referring there a bit to Tony Stark's Iron Man and his sometimes try-hard punchlines and especially to Chris Pratt who has absolutely no comedic talent if his material is not outstandingly good. By the way, Tony Stark is also included briefly in this film here or rather his company I should say. He himself is not for obvious reasons. A few words on Zendaya: I was critical about her too in the past and I still think the way she is overexposed in Hollywood right now does not match her talent as a whole. If we are talking about Spider-Man's romantic interest, I'd probably pick Emma Stone over her, Kirsten Dunst maybe not. Still Zendaya is growing a bit on me as well. I just wish she would go with her full name at some point. That would make it easier to respect her as an actress. Anyway, there was really only one moment here that she had that I did not like, namely when she stands up against Dr. Strange. That was not a strong female moment, but on the cringeworthy side, also how softly Strange reacted to her. He was right really when he said that Holland's Peter Parker is just a boy and that's it. J. Jonah Jameson would definitely agree and it is just a phenomenon how J. K. Simmons keeps portraying the character for decades. Awesome stuff as I adore the actor, but I must still say it is a such a limited character that there was almost nothing to him here this time. Only seeing him early on in his chamber there recording more anti-Spidey propaganda was funny. He surely made him his priority gently-speaking. Or, more accurately, his obsession. So there is a third Oscar winner on board here in fact.As my review is getting closer to an end, I also want to talk a little more about the other Spideys here. They included really great references to their films from years ago that kinda made me want to watch those again at some point in the near future. I mean pretty much their entire inclusion here did. But there were specific moments too and those were not about the comedy like some of the earlier stuff I mentioned, but they were about serious situations. I am referring to Franco's character in these very old films or also how Osborn says he has a job for Parker, just like he liked the character back then and with Garfield's character the most serious moment is of course when he holds Zendaya's character like he held Stone's back then. But Holland's character, the current Spidey, also has his own major loss here. Family affair. The moment was maybe not as touching as I would have liked it to be, so yeah there are negative criticisms for me too with this film for sure, but they are not too major. The good moments are far more frequent. The ending in terms of closure was really nice too with how he runs into certain characters again and we know there is hope for him and with Zendaya's character it is also best if he starts anew and destroys the note he prepared. It's basically as if his universe is a new one as well. Only he remembers what happened. Back to solitude and ready to save the world or at least New York many more times. Look at the cup on the table and what is written on it before he swings out in the end through New York during wintertime. The snow was amazing. At the very end, let me say that you also see Jake Gyllenhaal at the very start in what is a reference back to the second movie from this trilogy. But as I said, the closure to this third film and the entire trilogy could not have been any better. Great job and this makes it very easy to forget some previous mediocrities. Such a creative movie. One of 2021's best. Do not miss out.", "Watch only for special effects !": "We need more soul and feel in the stories , only having special effects does not make it more worthy.Definitely overrated! We really miss the original spider man who was so common yet so special. Being spider man was so special! In this movie, With so many superheroes sometimes it is hard to ascertain whether you are watching Avengers, Doctor strange , Spiderman or some other marvel movies. Spider man is just another person.The original spider man was so special, he had a sweet grandmother, a girl friend, he went to college , he liked milk and cake , he celebrated Christmas, yet he could cast a web.In this movie he simply is not so common anymore, by giving him too many powers , you disconnect him from humans and associate him with something else.We don't feel that that the guy we meet down the street could be that anonymous spiderman.", "Marvel's writing problem plagues what could have been the best Spiderman movie ever": "(No Spoilers)Spiderman: No Way Home is probably the biggest superhero movie since Avengers Endgame... There's no denying that. Ever since this movie's announcement, you knew this was a bigger deal than the usual superhero flicks. And being a movie with such high expectations, means that there's so much room for things to go wrong. And unfortunately... It seems like it did.Now I'm fresh out of the theatre, and I already feel like this movie had so much potential wasted. A sentiment I also share towards Avengers Endgame; where the only thing the writers seemed to worry about was 'fan-service'. Fan service is fine honestly, but the line should be when fan-service slowly starts taking over for storytelling. Because the storytelling in this movie was childish.Don't get me wrong... I enjoyed the movie... I enjoyed the theatre experience... It was fun... But fun is not enough when you realize what could have been. Spiderman: No Way Home could have been Marvel's most ambitious project yet, but it has the curse of Marvel's horrible writing staff who similarly messed up everything from Avengers Endgame, to WandaVision, to Falcon and the Winter Soldier, to Loki and to Black Widow. The plot of the movie sounds like some cheap fan fiction that somehow got made. And what's even worse is its absolutely cringe worthy dialogue; existing for the sole purpose of reminding the audience of previous Spiderman movies. It's such a dumb and convenient plot that just exists for the sake of nostalgia.I loved Avengers Infinity War and I really enjoyed Spiderman Far From Home, but I haven't enjoyed a single Marvel project since, because all their projects have been so shallow with no real substance to back itself up. Marvel has a writing problem that needs to be looked into, for the sake of cinema and storytelling.What a missed opportunity... What an absolutely missed opportunity...", "Entertaining.....but something felt missing.": "Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed this movie. Although it mainly just looked like a cameo showcase with some connective plot. Even the lines were cameo'd in certain areas to possibly trigger nostalgia more.I sort of liked the story and get what they were trying to do, but it seemed too complicated to be executed with a clean narrative. I don't like how Doctor Strange was down powered by Peter Parker, i know Peter is a smart nerdy kid with powers but it destroyed the whole mystic arts master vibe that we love from Strange. Maybe it's just me that felt that way.Like i said i get the idea but it was too quick of an execution. I guess development would cause the movie to be 5 hours long. It was a little cringy in areas where i noticed plot holes just so they could speed up the story and not give proper explanations. It was just too large of an idea to crush into a 2+ hour movie and make sense.My answer is enjoy the movie through nostalgia and entertainment, don't look for clean story because instead the movie looked like a brag on what Disney can accomplish when making deals with other studios. Using nostalgia as a weapon again, Disney do this all the time.", "Watch a fan made video instead": "Can't believe the high ratings. This movie drags and drags. It's like script writer zoomed with fans (not the best) and cobbled together scenes.It's like grandma showing photos of past Spidey movies and endlessly rattling (that's how the characters conversation feels like).Where are the honest reviews?Can't believe MCU is getting worse than DCU!!", "Great Ending To A Great Trilogy": "While No Way Home never reached the heights of some of the MCU's best for me, the film is still an incredible achievement that carefully juggles decades of Spider-Man storytelling to craft a satisfying adventure that takes you through many different emotions. The third act's big surprises might overshadow some of the movie's flaws, but the handling of fan service is done to perfection without feeling forced. A great ending to one of my favorite superhero movie trilogies of all time.", "Just Awesome": "Awesome Story line and thinking. Marvel nailed it Again can't even imagine how they thinks awesome like this. Never rates any movie with full star rating. Awesome Just Awesome.", "This movie was so insanely good; Best Spider-Man film ever (Yes, seriously)": "This is it. It's what we've all been waiting for. This is the Infinity War equivalent for the Spider-Man movies, it's the most ambitious cross-over in the history of Spider-Man, and honestly, the most ambitious cross-over since Infinity War.Insane cast, Willem Dafoe brings an Oscar-worthy performance, Tom Holland and Marisa Tomei both bring their dramatic A-game, Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield reprising their roles with heartfelt intensity, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx are incredible antagonists (though as far as villains go, Dafoe steals the show, just as Garfield does for the good guys).Insane fan service. Great intro of Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock in official MCU capacity. Fantastic way to bring back Garfield and Maguire. Great choice of villains, even if the 6th member of the Sinister Six was getting drunk in Mexico. We finally get an official \"With great power, comes great responsibility\". Nice meme material, \"You know, I'm something of a scientist myself\" and \"my back\". The fan service here didn't feel forced.Great action. CGI wasn't the best the MCU has to offer, but absolutely gets the job done. I think as the Dr. Strange's skills as a sorcerer have improved, so too have the creativity of the visuals used to depict his spells. Very fresh feel of the mirror dimension this time around, looking forward to seeing it again in the next Dr. Strange film.Most of all, it's a great story. The character growth is dynamic and well paced. It happens on all facets and it's very clear that the writers and Jon Watts have taken to heart criticism of the first two MCU Spider-Man films. There's the heart-wrenching loss of Aunt May (never gets easier to see any Spider-Man losing someone), a serious stepping up of Tom Holland's Peter Parker to be more than just an Iron Man Jr., and an apologetic reminder that Parker is broke (and not a Stark trust fund kid), both during the movie and once again at the end, when his slate is wiped clean. Garfield gets a chance to save Holland's MJ in a very dramatic mini-\"redemption arc\". The best part of the script is the motif that Spider-Man's best attribute is his incredible moral compass, and great moral strength, willing to take on all the pain and sacrifice so that his friends and neighborhood can live on prosperously even if he gets left behind. It's an echo that establishes the Spider-Man at the end of the film as a spiritual successor to Capt. America more strongly than it does as an Iron Man Jr. The growth that Maguire and Garfield's Spider-Men bring in helping Holland's Spider-Man realize that vengeance is not what Aunt May would have wanted, and by extension, is not the Spider-Man way is incredibly touching and a fantastic dynamic for the three Spider-Men. Toby Maguire's goodbye in the movie \"You know. It's what we do\" to Tom Holland is a great send-off and acknowledgement that the mantle of Spider-Man is never an easy one to wear, but it's one that Spider-Men in every universe wear with great power and responsibility.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a tale of sacrifice, growth, and redemption. Say what you will about the quantity of the MCU, but the quality of select films like Spider-Man: No Way Home is undeniable, and I hope this isn't the last time we see an adventure as epic as this was.", "What The Hell Was This ?": "I was very disappointed with this latest Spiderman epic ,visually it was top notch the disappointing part was the story ,i thought it was total crap .Stan Lee must be turning in his grave.", "Every second was real!!": "Honestly fully confident this is best spider-man movie. Found myself subconsciously clapping and just screaming inside with joy. The returns of some characters are incredible. The film balances the comedy with a dark/sad plot to follow. Tom Hollands spider-man in a film so crowded still manages to shine and outdoes himself with his performance. This feels like a true spider-man movie especially in the very last scene. His performance is incredible and some of the action sequences are beautiful with moves taken from the game. This feels like the most badass, realistic and cool portrayal of a spider-man yet. It maintains comic accuracy and tom's suits are beautiful. Some scenes are absolutely heart wrenching, i found myself crying numerous times. This film is a masterpiece and a love letter to all marvel or spiderman fans and a work of art. It avoids the other spider-man movies mistakes and just gives characters such realistic convincing arcs. A true work of art, round of applause for John Watts and Tom Holland.", "Amazing, friendly & multiverse neighborhood-ly": "Spider man, now a friendly neighborhood guy not just in queen's, but the multiverse. Movie was amazing, astonishing & similar other adjectives \ud83d\ude1c. Was entertaining from 0:00 to credits. Maybe, especially coz I am fan. Though, would also throw light on some negatives. They changed the characters a bit, my adding some more characteristics, which aren't there originally. Logic behind a turning point in the movie is a near to absurd. Still, it was super-fun over all.", "Spider-man stupidity doesn't make sense": "I love MCU's other spiderman's movies, they were great, specially the last one ''Spider-man :Far from home\"I was just mesmerized by it's virtual effects and story was kind of unique and tricky too. However, I excepted a bit more in this as the ratings seems really high. But, all my expectations fall flat. I donno why they tried to present Spider-man as a messy one! Most stupidest thing is why would he tries to snach the box from doctor strange? For saving these dangerous criminals??", "Pointless": "Convoluted plot. Self serving. Damaging to the Spider-man franchise. Not rewarding for fans of the Spider-man stories. Not a film I would pay to watch, glad it is included in my cable TV STARZ package.", "Perfection": "Spider-Man No way home is simply put a masterpiece. Encapsulating audiences in a world where anything can happen and everything does happen. From Matt Murdock appearing as Peter's lawyer and obviously all the villains from the prior Spider-Man franchises coming into this movie, it elevates the overall film enormously and creates nostalgia and empathy for characters that have been introduced years before. The first half an hour of the film set us up for a thrilling and action packed ride that doesn't have a bland or boring moment. Once Peter loses Aunt May to the green Goblin the tone of the movie dramatically dies down and becomes a more sinister and dark take on Spider-Man. This is in great contrast with the main attraction of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire reprising their roles as Spider-Man. The amount of nostalgia is uncanny in this movie and sets a pace of emotion but takes its time to lay a story and plot simultaneously with the action and VFX. The inclusion of the final fight sequence involving the three Spider-Man and the original villains was a cinematic masterpiece in terms of action, emotion, cinematography and acting with a great sense of humour and comedic timing. The small but noticeable nods to the Sam Ramii and Amazing Spider-Man movies are sincere and provide jest to the viewers and loyal fans. In conclusion the movie Spider-Man No way Home was a master piece that I wouldn't change in any sense of the movie.", "A Finale & New beginning": "The Movie was released on South Korea today.. and I saw it!I woke up very early at 7AM to see the first showing. Thanks for making me a less lazy person loolOverall I liked it and was satisfied. The movie is filled with fan service and throwbacks to previous movies -- so I highly recommend that you see all the previous movies. It will enhance the experience.And not only that, the movie has its own story and identity. What Tom Holland's Spiderman goes through - it was very satisfying to watch.The ending is the best ending in the MCU trilogy, and probably one of my favorite spiderman endings.The movie took some risks and things will never be the same for spiderman after this movie - and I am excited to see what will come next.There are some moments where the scene / conversation goes too long that it gets kinda frustrating / annoying. The action is nice but not as good as stuff like shang-chi.These are just small nit-picks, the overall experience is still great.*There are Two End-credit scenes, and Both are fantastic.**Willem Dafoe more like Willem DaGoat.", "Best movie I've ever seen.": "Yes, it doesn't make sense to only bring 2 spider-men from another 2 universes and villains that also were in those 2 movies, but Marvel here just tried to revive the past, remind us with Toby who we were raised by him. Andrew who's just amazing. And Tom who's Tony Stark's trainee. I loved every detail in it, I liked how Toby is still decent, polite, He's just our spider man who raised us to do what's right no matter what's the cost. And you always have a 2nd chance to be good. On other hand, Tom taught us that with great powers comes great responsibility, and we should never seek revenge and do the right thing. I love all of them and I hope to see TASM3 soon as Andrew really deserves it. And when I say the best I've ever seen, It's really the best I've ever seen. Hopefully Dr. MOM top this movie.", "Fun fan service but sloppy story": "The action is great. It was fun seeing all the villains. Defoe is excellent. There was also some really heartfelt dramatic moments. I did like the ending. But...\nPROBLEM 1:The whole genesis of the problems that Peter Parker faces is a complete betrayal of Dr. Stranges character. There is no way in hell he would gamble with the fate of the universe to cast this spell for Peter. Know matter how bad he wants things to be better for Peter.PROBLEM 2: Now all of a sudden we can cure evil in our villains?! I found this to be ridiculous. Complete incompetence of Peter to just not hit the button and send these villains back to their universe. Way too much of a gamble to just keep all the villains around while he creates some drugs to cure mental illness.", "Most overated MCU movie of all time": "You know a movie is bad when it relies on pure nostalgia to be relevant and it fails too. Cringe jokes, lifeless characters, bad writing and straight up boring. I'm glad i didn't waste my money to watch this on the cinema. The last great MCU movie was Infinity war. After this movie only Legend of ten rings is decent, all other movies including Doctor Strange in the multiverse of madness are pure garbage cash grabs.", "Every line classic cliche and total garbage.": "A kiddy movie for braindead people a disgrace for the mc industrie,\nwho wrote the lines a five year old would have been done better.So borring switched of after the entrance in to the school, what else to say,typical boring extended movies.", "Absurd garbage for imbeciles": "The most mediocre superhero crap that could be contrived in an effort to fleece small brained dummies.

No problem with that. Every week there is one or the other weak movie being premiered and get bashed as per their standard.What amazes me is the mass public reaction towards this movie, sometimes dubbing it as the best Marvel or Spider-man movie of all time.

The movie got all those star to come back and play in it. And since the first Spiderman movie was around the year 2000, 2 decades of fan came back to flood the scoring with a bunch of 10s. The plot I must say is quite infuriating, they have taken this no killing thing way too far and have decided to make the Tom holland peter a very annoying kid. Perhaps it is because it is the first major film in phase 4, but if they want to create an event to introduce the antagonist in phase 4 at least let it be something cool and not some stupid teenager's stupid mistake. If I were to summarize the film briefly it will be tom\" Peter tried to do good, but caused a lot of harm on the way, and in the end he actually didn't do any good, it also seems he have brought in even more problem.\"", "Junk Food of a Movie": "I am pretty stunned that this movie is as popular as it is. It's basically a contrived gimmick to pull together the characters from past Spidey incarnations and crack a lot of jokes.I have never been a fan of Tom Holland's take on Spiderman as a good hearted teen-ager being overly deferential to every adult he deals with. It's a one-note performance and from the start it's been contrived and unconvincing. Andrew Garfield relied on looking at the ground and foot-shuffling when he was trying to portray Spiderman. Holland just calls everyone 'Sir' all the time.So...in a stupid corny contrived scene, Spiderman can't shut up long enough to allow Dr. Strange to cast a spell and everything is set in motion. Dimensional reality is breached and the other Spider Men from other Universes wind up in the new Spider Man's reality. So do all the old baddies from the old movies. Doc Occ/Goblin/SandMan/Electro/Lizard Man. So the three Spideys + Zendaya and her giant nose and Spider's Nerd Pal join together to correct the histories of multiple universes and they succeed but at a huge cost.There is a ton of 'jokey' humour in this junk food burger that doesn't work. There are standard Marvel CGI effects. There are a strangely bunch of complacent half-hearted no motivation baddies.The whole thing is horribly contrived, doesn't make sense, the characters don't act in sensible fashion, and our Hero is left with nothing but his super-hero identity....which we are left with the idea that that is all he needs because it is his destiny.Plot wise this movie was as bad as The Eternals. It is basically a movie for kids I guess. Fundamentally it was simple, stupid, contrived. Like a Big Mac, it filled you up, left you sluggish and wishing you had eaten something of better quality.", "I don't think the writing was up to standard.": "First half is almost unbearable with Peter's friends and family taking larger roles than previous films, they just don't cut it. The comedy misses it's mark and the emotional scenes have no impact. The only good supporting character in first half is Dr. Strange. But, the second half does redeem the film somewhat. This is probably one of the weakest in the franchise.", "It's amazing!": "While I have several Marvel and DC superhero movies that I like, I also have many that I do not like, and I'm not that easily impressed. For example, I honestly found the previous Spiderman movie to be mostly pretty boring. But this one...this is amazing! The way both of the previous Spidermen, as well as pretty much all the major villains, from the old movies, all feature in this (they don't just make cameos, they are actively part of the story!), and are ALL played by the original actors, is just so incredibly awesome! They even throw in Daredevil and Venom cameos! Then add on the fact that they actually try to SAVE all the villains rather than kill them...It's just fantastic...If you're a Spiderman fan, or a superhero fan, this is a mut-watch, and if you're not, you should see it anyway!", "A lot of brilliance to take in": "The anticipation for the movie was second to only Avengers: Endgame. So naturally I was expecting big things, and trust me, it didn't disappoint.I found myself, throughout the film and the days after watching it, trying and failing to pin my thoughts down and give it a score out of 10. This is likely due to the amalgamation of so many previous characters, spanning from 2002-2021 through multiple movies and franchises. This was not a negative, but rather something to be very, very excited about and nervous of how it would be handled. I was scared of a clear villain not being established, however Willem Defoe's Green Goblin was expertly presented as 'the baddie'. Peter is haunted by him after the death of Aunt May, and his iconic, almost Joker-esque laugh gave him a real villainous tone.I can't write a spoilers review without talking about the other Spider-men. The relationship between the three Peter's is everything every Spider-man fan has ever wanted, from their hilarious conversations about web shooters and aliens to their instant connection over the loss of their loved ones. I could not help but laugh at the simplicity yet complication of it all, it's just three different Peter's, yet 20 years in the making. A side note, does this mean that the MCU started in 2002?The basic plot for this film is something new for Spider-man. And while it works very well, it did keep me asking questions about Doctor Strange's abilities. Could he have made everyone forget about the clip that Mysterio made instead of listening to Peter's suggestion? Surely he's smart enough to know that Peter wouldn't want everyone to forget? This line of logic is the main fault with this film. Specifically towards the end when every universe is about to raid Peter's and he suggests to just recast the original spell. Films in which the main character suddenly comes up with some form of solution at the end undermines the entire movie.Tom Holland takes the role of Spider-man in a different way than Andrew Garfield or Tobey Maguire did. Throughout his first trilogy, he doesn't \"change\" into Spider-man, he essentially stays as Peter even when he's in the suit. This helped bring Peter alive and give us a much more realistic representation of the character. He also doesn't have as much of a problem of balancing lives like Maguire did, or a problem with his Uncle Ben for that matter (Who isn't even mentioned by Holland's Parker after Maguire's Parker explains how he lost him). His adorable geekiness and lovable lightheartedness make this film not only a brilliant Spider-man movie, but a brilliant Peter Parker movie too.", "Obnoxious Super Hero": "How he deatroys the universe because he wanted his girlfriend to remember him. Then he wanted to change the super vilans who are already DEAD. This kid made onw miastake after another and everyone suffered beacuse of him. Except for the storyline everythig else is awesome.", "Absolutely perfect": "The whole film was amazing didn't disappoint at all!! Will be seeing it again this weekend 100%, just wow!!Whole cast were great... absolutely speechless throughout.", "An unimpressive fan-service movie, plenty of dull dialogues and ridiculous scenes.": "\"No Way Home\" is an ambitious project that tries to unite Spider-Man fans of different generations and I have appreciated this effort. I am not against fan-service movies, as long as the plot is interesting and well developed. It is a film that overwelcome its staying, with a length of almost two hours and a half. I had to split the viewing on two different days, because I was getting really bored. There are tons of scenes that needed to be cut, as some plot points are completely useless. The premises are ridiculous: basically all the mess happening in the film is due to some Peter's whim. Therefore all the fights that we see against the villains were perfectly avoidable, if only Doctor Strange was a bit more responsible and would just clarify with Parker his intentions, before executing the spell. It baffles me that such a powerful sorcerer commits these mistakes, it does not make any sense.It is enjoyable seeing three different Spider-Men generations united in one great movie with their respective enemies to fight. However due to the excessive length, this meeting between Parkers came way too late, when my attention span was already really, really low. There are a few good moments between them, but there are many cringey jokes, worth probably of a preteen audience. Dialogues are cheesy and annoying. It is sad that screenwriters could not come with something a bit more creative and well thought out, especially considering that this was the big reunion that a lot of fans were waiting for a long time. It is a disappointing result that does not really add anything new to the big cinematic universe: once again the multiverse is mentioned, and finally we start to see a glimpse of some consequences of this topic on the MCU, but it is not enough, especially for a two hours and a half movie. If you are a die hard fan, maybe you will enjoy this movie more than I did. For me it was a wasted opportunity to do something really great.", "Spider-Man: Consolidation": "This film was entertaining enough. I liked the acting, the little gems, the sheer hubris of the story. However, it was for all intents and purposes, a universe consolidation move (before they break it all again in Multiverse of Madness). It's one of those reset stories, but one that manages to unite previous resets, which makes it the resettiest of them all. It is there to basically answer all the comic geek questions about how could so many films and reboots and stories exist in the same MCU and open the door to the future.There were no real new characters, some were explained away, some where killed off and new concepts of the incoming threats hinted at. One end-credits scene winked towards a Venom recrossing, while the second was basically a trailer for the next Doctor Strange film, not a \"scene\".So there is a difference between the typical Marvel cinematic universe film and this one: the villain(s) are weak and unfocused while the plot, however entertaining, just a background to the goal of the film: to stabilize the canon and prepare for the new Doctor Strange movie. This does mean the Strangeverse will grow and possibly be amazingly fun, but also that I don't see the Avengers going anywhere for a long while, except maybe TV series.In conclusion: for the fans of the Marvel stories and the faithful viewers of movies and series in that universe, this is a big nice bonus, a step on a promising ladder of new content. However as a standalone film it has limited value. It is a good film, and probably a necessary one, but its storytelling will not blow your mind in any way.", "Beware of the fake reviews, this deserves nothing more than 6": "OMG, the first hour thirty minutes was a total waste of time, senseless plot and actions, and Tom doing what he does best, being the worst spidey ever. And his two best friends couldn't act to save their own skin. Frankly, the movie wouldn't have survived more than 4 stars if not for Tobey and Garfield's presence. The whole plot was a flop to be honest, I can't understand why they would even go for it. I mean the idea was great but the execution was terrible esp the introduction of the two spideys. And how in the world did Spidey outsmart Dr Strange in his own world, but he couldn't handle a mere human like Green Goblin?! And he was able to scoop up MJ and make a run for it but he couldn't pick up Aunt May and rush her to the hospital? Absolutely childish. Don't believe all the amazing reviews, they are just diehard marvel fans.Question, do different people write the scripts for each Spidey because Garfield's lines are the best.", "a great success": "I have many thoughts about this movie. But if I had to make a single sentence; I don't know if it's the best spider man movie but I'm sure it's the most iconic spider man movie in history.", "Best Movie Ever (Atleast When It Comes To Supes)": "Ohh man, what a ride. This movie is a dream come true for me. So Spider-man: No Way Home, before I write this let me collect my thoughts. I would say my review might be a lot partial, I have watched this movie 5 times in theatres in every format available. The movie is everything everyone wanted. Jon Watts \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f you really outdid yourself from the prequels. Let's start with the main crew. Tom Holland, I haven't been a big fan of his spider-man since his take felt a bit childish in the previous movies, but I gotta change my opinion now since, man he felt like a real Peter Parker this time. The Peter Parker known to make sacrifices for the greater good, he was perfect, from the initial childish role to maturing by the end of the movie, it felt unreal. Zendaya, she is just perfect, the best MJ - Michelle Jones that is, but his and Tom's chemistry is perfect, they are made for each other and so are their characters. Ned played a perfect supporting role. And the villains, nobody is better than Willem Dafoe. I guess they all redeemed themselves in a way. Especially Electro, \"I thought you were black\". Oh yeah, Dr. Strange, Benedict Cumberbatch, his and Peter's were nothing but amusing.Now moving on to the story. The daredevil cameo was quick in a rather fully loaded movie. The villains came and started wreaking havoc. Peter \"Tom\" got the line that he deserved when Aunt May dies by the hand of the Goblin. That rage that he felt I could relate to the character so much. The way his friends tried to help him, especially MJ. And then the entry of the two Peter's. Andrew was perfect. I loved him, cause I am from the generation who saw him as the Spider-man. He was amazing, just awesome. Whereas Tobey, his presence felt unreal. I never thought I would be so happy seeing him. And the conclusion and the way the Peters worked together that was the best one of the best action sequences ever. The way they made memes real and yes they talked about the webs, you know how it is produced inside Tobeys Peter. I loved how the conclusion came about where Tobey taught Tom's Peter to not cross the line and stay true to his hero name. And finally when Strange reversed the spell, where Peter made the decision of making everyone forget about him, to save his loved ones. The scene in the bakery where Peter decides not to tell MJ who he is and the new suit. The movie is perfect.IF NOT WATCHED YET, WATCH IT, PLEASE WATCH IT.", "Absolutely AMAZING!!!!": "This has to be the best Spidey film I have ever seen, especially if you have grown up with the films and franchise, the scenes and story just flow magnificently and have lots of surprises along the way. Go see it as soon as possible and dodge all the spoilers, you certainly won't regret it! There are two end credits scenes too so don't leave too early.....I want to go see it all over again it was superb! Make mine Marvel!!!!", "The film was want we wanted and more": "(SPOILER)\nThe film was fantastic it was everything we wanted and I love how the hype was made by rumours about Andrew and tobey and more I think that was so amazing because everyone want the film to be one thing and that what Sony and marvel and they did in such a good way that I diddnt get to the point were it was overwhelming so they did a great job.

Pure treat, executed insanely well. Great job marvel.", "Wow, just, wow.": "It was incredible... No more words. I went to 4DX and I absolutely recommend it. The amount of redemption you feel in this movie is second to none... Especially if you're a early 2000s kid this movie is a must watch.", "Fan service": "The movie was just a big fan service, the whole movie could just have ended with a push of a button, the acting was good but the plot was just bad and a big fan service.", "Horrible": "The first Marvel movie I couldn't watch all the way through. Poor character representation, meaningless, silly story. Viewing is recommended for children only.", "Extremely overrated": "Don't get me wrong, it is a good movie, and it has got a lot of interesting, new and nostalgic elements to make it noteworthy.But comparing it to the movies that lies around it on the #40 best movies of all time, and seeing it get better ratings than the likes of the last avengers movies is appalling. Comparing it to other marvel movies, does not suggest that it is a much better movie than Ant-Man, Thor and several others.Yes it is extremely fun that they have brought back the old villains and other spider-men many of us grew up with, but this does not ultimately make it an insanely good move - like other reviews may suggest.", "Excellent": "So satisfying. I love Dr. Octo.I was waiting for venom but they just a cameo lol.The moment when peter 3 catching MJ is so overwhelming and painful too.", "Spider-Man gets another masterpiece": "One of the best Spider-Man movies ever. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fanservice galore fest done extremely well with jokes, emotion, and heart added to the mix. Not only giving closure to so much of Spider-Man's character, but also for the fans who always wondered how certain things would play out if they happened. This is a movie you need to witness.Picking up right off from Spider-Man: Far from Home, the film gets straight into action with dealing on consequences and trying to amend outcomes. In some ways similar to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the film stays interesting from scene after scene and never misses a beat. Solid action set pieces and character interactions give the film a lot of fun things to work with, and by the end everyone was clapping and cheering.Without spoilers, No Way Home will please most people who are familiar with all the previous Spider-Man films. I got a little emotional and attached when certain characters popped up again and I definitely didn't feel the movie was a quick-in cashgrab at all. The performances were all really good, the special effects were top notch, and some of the music will be familiar to the fans.In the end, it proves Marvel can still pull off a really entertaining yet rewarding movie for Spider-Man fans. Some minor criticisms I have is there are a few contrivances and maybe some characters could have gotten a bit more screentime, but in the end I had such a blast with what the movie set out to do. No Way Home will probably be my favourite film of 2021. Try to go without spoilers though, it will be more satisfying.8.5/10.", "Everything We Could Have Hoped For And More": "They did what endgame couldn't. It was everything I had hoped for and more. Seeing all these familiar faces was great and being there to witness it among fellow fans is unforgettable. The pure joy I felt seeing Andrew then Tobey is unmatched. Oh and the fact they killed Aunt May?! I can't believe they had the guts to do that. Poor Peter has lost everyone he's ever loved. And that ending! I have so many questions about what happens next for him. How do you live when nobody knows you exist? Movie was just fantastic. Perfect fan-service, nostalgic, heartbreaking, intense, and hilarious. Everyone was perfectly presented and got the necessary screen time (which endgame failed to properly do). I hope to never forget tonight and the way this made me feel. Thank you Marvel and Sony for redeeming Andrew's Spider-Man and bringing together the holy trinity. I still can't believe they did it.", "Underwhelming, Relies too Much on Nostalgia": "As a huge Doctor Strange fan who is more than ready for more of the multiverse, I had very high expectations for No Way Home. Unfortunately, it was a let down. Sure it caters to fans with some nostalgic moments, but relies way way way too much on the fan service while lacking in pretty much all other areas. The story was all over the place, pacing was very wishy-washy, and the writing was horrendous for the most part. It felt very childish and cheap at a lot of moments with jokes that just did not land at all and some super corny dialogue. My best friend and I were genuinely confused at the amount of laughs, cheers, and claps from our audience in the theater tonight (and we are both very big Marvel fans, my best friend being a long-time, devoted spidey fan). So believe me when I tell you that we really wanted to love this movie. Honestly our favorite part of the entire film was the post-credits features. If anything, this movie only further solidified my belief that Tom Holland is the weakest of the Spider-Mans. Not necessarily his fault, but rather the fault of the writers for trying way too hard to make him a quirky, shy, stuttery, awkward teenager and not giving him any real development or depth to his character aside from maybe the two seconds after May's death and his fight with Osborn where we see a glimpse of a dark side in him, but that's it. Additionally, killing off May was just so lame. It reeked of \"we need to kill off a character for some kind of shock value but not anyone too important\". Another moment that I don't understand is when Toby is seemingly fatally injured in a sudden and surprising moment towards the end of the film, but then is all of a sudden okay a few minutes later? There were just too many moments that felt like it was relying on audience reactions and surprise in order to come across as a good movie. I think the main reason it is receiving such praise right now is because of the current hype around Andrew and Toby reprising their roles (which was great fun don't get me wrong), but in the long run didn't feel like it served much of a purpose to the actual story beyond wanting to drop a bombshell on fans. By the fifth conversation/conflict about how Peter can \"cure\" the villains and save the world, the entire movie became a jumbled and chaotic mess. Interesting concept but executed poorly.", "HYPE": "Whatever the fudge ur expectations are and how high it is... trust me. It outshines everything you ever think of. The trailer you've seen on YouTube showed you nothing.", "Farming more nostalgia": "Marvel fans are just like Star Wars fans. It's not surprising that both are owned by Disney and it really shows. \"He did the thing\", \"It's the guy\", \"Wow they did the joke\". It's just so bland and Disney is just mainstreaming everything to be some bland cash in on nostalgia. Every now and then you can see an interesting concept or a good scene shine through but more often than not, it is ruined right away by some stupid joke or switch to a funny scene. There is no character no soul left in these corporate franchises.Content like this doesn't matter, it is just like another Fifa or Madden game every year. They dont care about actually creating something worthwhile.What doesn my opinion matter anyways. For every one of my opinion there are houndreds of thousands of people who have no expectations.", "A celebration of Spider Man's legacy! No Way Home comes to an end as a comic book adaptation and is not afraid to embrace more fanciful aspects": "After months of rumors, theories and speculation, there was a certain fear that expectations around the film had become so high that it would be impossible to meet them. However, this third Spider-Man solo film within the MCU delivers exactly what fans expected and wanted, nothing less and nothing more. The film brilliantly resolves all the criticisms and complaints from most fans; Peter Parker in the MCU was too tight. He wasn't a penniless photographer and student, Aunt May wasn't worried about the bills, there wasn't a J. J. Jameson behind him.Aware of the importance that the Spider-Man has conquered in these almost 20 years, Sony and Marvel Studios have taken the path of nostalgia and made No Return Home a great celebration of this legacy without abandoning the current journey of the Friendly Neighborhood. The biggest proof of this is in the opening minutes of the production, which picks up exactly where Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019) had left off. With the adventurous and almost uncompromising tone characteristic of the two previous films, the story doesn't take long to give the young man a taste of the consequences of being treated as a public enemy by the population. So he turns to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. In the best of intentions, the wizard helps the boy, who ends up disturbing the spell to the point of opening cracks in the much talked about multiverse. This intervention results in the Multiverse being inserted once and for all in the MCU - before, with brushstrokes in Loki, WandaVision and What If...? - And that brings back Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx's Electro, the Lizard and the Sandman. The reason why the gallery of villains from the different versions of Spider-Man in the movies is gathered is not only commendable, but also a hallmark of Spider-Man and the guiding thread of the entire plot: good for good.Gradually, No Return Home abandons the simplicity that has been Spider-Man's trademark in the MCU and begins to add seriousness in a gradual, but efficient way. More than denying what they did in Homecoming (2017) and Far from Home, screenwriters Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers promote a more than welcome evolution for the hero and those around him. This also contributes to giving the adventure the epic tone it deserves. This chapter is clearly a coming-of-age plot for today's young Peter Parker from beginning to end. The production delivers numerous factors that lead to the character's growth, providing key moments to make him a leading and somewhat independent hero. While his previous films promise such a question, this is definitely the project that lives up to its evolutionary premise. The film plays in the face of the hero and those who watch that he has to face real and painful consequences, to learn about the responsibilities that come with the mantle he chose to wear to help people and that's exactly what the film addresses: growing up in narrative magnitude and make the character grow in development.Despite the plot seem lost at the beginning, and probably, tiring in very brief moments, and being just an ambitious film that will play with fan service to win over its viewers, everything makes a lot of sense in the journey. This is not a production that wants to please the audience with its huge catalog of characters for nothing. Spider-Man: No Return Home is fun, electrifying and exciting, like a roller coaster full of surprises, and luckily, it delivers great memorable moments. There is a lot to process here, with several characters to assimilate and contain the emotion for what is yet to come, however, there is a very well distributed division to highlight that each figure present is an essential piece to compose this great puzzle that makes clear the extremely well-crafted script by the duo Erik Sommers and Chris McKenna.Knowing the weight of each character involved, whether those who already inhabit this universe, such as Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) and the inseparable Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon) and MJ (Zendaya), or the villains who return, the text of the duo of screenwriters finds space to deal with each one more than satisfactorily. With so many people involved, the story ran the risk of becoming a mess, but this problem was overcome with a balance rarely seen in Marvel productions.The script strives to give moments to each of these characters and the direction of Jon Watts takes the cue to translate that into memorable moments. Full of reverence for what Sam Raimi and Marc Webb did in the pre-MCU Spider-Man films, the director does his best work in front of the hero by stepping out of his comfort zone and taking advantage of the possibilities created by the presence of so many iconic characters. The action scenes are full of energy and really exciting. With text that quickly ties who the visitors from other universes are to potential viewers who haven't seen Spider-Man's previous adventures on the big screen, No Return Home has a clear path to give them space to shine. With a function as simple as it is functional in the plot, they dominate the stage and enjoy every minute - with dialogue that works almost like inside jokes with fans that bring nostalgia without sounding gratuitous.Not by chance, the script is full of situations to catch the audience by the heart. It's nostalgic to see Maguire talking about his MJ or even the brotherly look he gives Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) when they meet again, just as the way the story presents Garfield's Peter as this someone bitter for having been unable to save Gwen Stacy - and makes for a great redemptive moment for that. It's impossible not to vibrate with each of these references to the point where you want more movies for each of them. PFor this reason, it is easy to overlook some inconsistencies or things poorly explained. It doesn't matter why Electro (Jamie Foxx) has become so much more villainous than he was in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 or even the swings the Lizard (Rhys Ifans) and Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) have in their motivations. All of this is easily overlooked in favor of the fun that this great party offers. This makes Homecoming like a big comic book come to life. In a story like this, you don't expect a big epic or anything like that, but a fun adventure that excites and leaves you excited at the end. And the new Spider-Man is all of that, even in the little things - from the appearance of Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) to the famous phrase \"With great power comes great responsibility\". The film delivers everything you expect.The classic Marvel formula humor is properly placed in the plot, working properly between these, highlighting the incredible return of Doctor Octopus by Alfred Molina, and the great and fun comic relief of the film, Jacob Batalon, playing Ned, best friend of Peter. And in addition to not having gained as much prominence in the two previous Spider-Man films, Zendaya finally earns her space, as well as becoming a beautiful and significant part of Parker's essence.Already the performance of Tom Holland is a major factor for everything to be even more fun and make the process interesting. He proves that he's not just a young man brimming with Spidey humor with no real problems. There's a sense of connection through every screen moment through his brilliant performance, underscoring that he's worthy of taking on the Peter Parker mantle for pop culture. Holland's growth is visible and rewarding, and is consecrated as his best performance to date in the MCU.The villains work very well together, however, there is no way to put aside and highlight Willem Dafoe's unique performance as the Green Goblin. The villain who marked a generation in the first Spider-Man movie starring Tobey Maguire shows in every way how timeless his relationship with the role is, even taking for himself, breathtaking action scenes. It's also visible how Jamie Fox grew up with Electro, gracing every screen moment he was present.Aware of the responsibility at hand, No Way Home comes to an end as a comic book adaptation that is not afraid to embrace more fanciful aspects. And he does it with pride, because he abandons the worry of looking cool or modern. It is curious that Marvel Studios, which usually fills its productions with clues to the future, has decided to look back on the Spider-Man case. After putting Peter Parker under the wing of several figures in its universe, the studio seems to finally have the courage to emancipate him, and it does so by celebrating a story built over nine films, dozens of cartoons and thousands of magazines.", "Worst Spider-man ever": "The only non-brain dead person in whole movie was Doctor Strange.Every line classic cliche and total garbage.No words can explain how much they just can't make a movie anymore without making it to get you not wanting to watch another movie anymore.", "Expect disappointment and you won't be disappointed": "Should have applied this logic to this film.Heard great things about this film and I was looking forward to watching it.WOW ! Was i disappointed !!!!Tried to do far too much in such a short time.It's that much of a disappointment I'll stop my review here and waste no more time on this film.", "Don't buy into the hype": "This movie really wasn't that good. In fact the sheer stupidity of Spider-man's decisions made it so agonizing to watch that I could barely get through it. You think you seen stupid characters before? Just wait till you see this clown. Don't waste your time.", "My new favorite Spider-Man movie": "Not only is this one of the best MCU films, its debatably the best Spider-Man film. It no doubt feels like a love letter to how far the Spider-Man films have come. This film wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for many things like the MCU setting up their own Spidey and Doctor Strange as well as everything that happened in all the previous Spider-Man films. It's fan service but the fan service has purpose to be there. But underneath all the fun callbacks it's still a damn good Spider-Man story. Tom Holland to me is the best live action Spider-Man we've had so far and he's come such a long way. From taking orders from Tony Stark in Civil War to now giving the orders to two other Spider-Men really is an achievement for him. The movie even fixes things many have had problems with. Not just for him but for other things too like how much of William Dafoe's performance as the Green Goblin we missed when he had to wear that helmet in the first Raimi Spider-Man movie. There's so many incredible moments in this movie id never thought id see one day. From Spider-Man defeating Doctor Strange with math to Aunt May's tragic death to watching all three Spider-Men swing together and do science was such a treat. It has almost everything I could want in a Spider-Man flick.The only negative I have for the film is the mid credit scene with Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock/Venom. I'm not a fan of those films as I don't like the direction they took this Eddie Brock and Venom. Having him jump to the MCU & than jump back to his own universe was just a waste of time & this whole Marvel Studios having to share the rights with Sony thing is just getting so obnoxious. I really hope they get the full rights back from Sony so these dumb villian spinoff movies can die before it gets even worse.Still it didn't ruin my experience with this highly entertaining flick. It's one of those movies I can watch for hours and never get bored\ud83d\udda4", "\"The multiverse is a concept of which we know frighteningly little.\"": "Easily the most anticipated and theorised comic book film since Avengers: Endgame. Spider-Man: No Way Home is set directly after the end of Far From Home. With Spider-Man's (Tom Holland) identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. When the spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear.It was always going to be difficult for this to live up to the myriad of potential expectations that had built up in mine and millions of others heads after the first trailer released back in August. Luckily throughout its duration No Way Home excels at fan pleasing moments and truly giving Peter monumental stakes and potential consequences. However it is undeniably overstuffed and choppy, as well as for me personally a lot of the MCU'isms not always particularly gelling well with the returning villains.I will be keeping the plot details vague, but for those who had expectations and ideas of what the film might be, it probably is pretty much what you expect. The opening act ripple effect of Peter's identity being revealed, with he, MJ and Ned being turned down by colleges and constant harassment sets the stage well and understandably Peter's desperation for Doctor Strange to fix it. From there the rogues gallery pour through and it's up to Peter to stop them.Here is where some of my favourite aspects of the film are, as well as my irritations. It's undeniably great seeing these characters return to the big screen, and throughout the second act it is uniquely executed and delivers some satisfying interactions between the foes (though some of their motivations could have been a bit more fleshed out), as well as time to breathe. However it is once again the abundance of joke attempts and alterations to a couple of the characters that just make some of the interactions feel awkward and cringe inducing.Doc Ock's bridge battle is a standout return and the choreography, sound design and score all intertwine nicely. Holland wasn't lying about this being a darker and more violent entry into the franchise, with the first Goblin brawl being the film's highlight, alongside the jaw-dropping visual spectacle of the mirror dimension duel. The final action set piece is pure spectacle and grin inducingly fun, it's just a shame that yet again it's another CGI heavy sequence set at night, so it's frequently hard to see what's going on at certain points.This is probably Holland's best Spider-Man performance as he really has some emotional heavy lifting to do, as well as keeping the quips and enthusiasm fresh. Willem Dafoe absolutely steals the film. He's still got all of it: the grin, the laugh, the expressions and genuine menace. Molina as well, brilliantly capturing the commanding intelligence and personality of Doc Ock and Jamie Foxx is far better suited in this iteration of Electro. Benedict Cumberbatch adds a layer of bitterness and snark to Strange, yet keeps his core values and dedication to help in check.Spider-Man: No Way Home may just be the film many fans of dreamed of. Unfortunately for me, whilst it still delivered a lot of what I wanted, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. Dafoe & Molina prove once again why Spider-Man 1 & 2 will never be topped, the increased personal stakes for Peter are welcome and I'm still partially in awe that the film actually happened. However the leering presence of now extremely familiar and annoying MCU traits and tropes, certain character interactions and an overstuffed storyline do hold it back.", "Marvel series converted into a Movie special": "In summary this movie was well received and for good reason because it's a solid good movie. With that being said it wasn't great and it wasn't the best spiderman movie. It heavily relied on nostalgia to carry the plot and development and while I can appreciate it all it didn't exactly climax as I was hoping for. Felt like the marvel series as of late just compiled into a movie instead of episodes.Tom holland uses up the last of his awkward teen spiderman attitude in a overdue effort for his character to finally start truly evolving. Yet it comes pretty slow over the course of this film. Additionally, the main conflicts in this movie basically are all spidermans faults when you really think about it which makes it even less of a plot arch due to the circular reasoning behind the movie.Nostalgically it carries the film for obvious reasons and while I loved what happens I feel like it wasn't as wholesome as I expected it to be.. I guess I just got a high expectation from all the great feedback of the film.There were some glaring issues with the plots reasoning and motivations but I get it. Overlooking some of those things it felt like this film was just a filler marvel movie to set up for the next phase and it showed up in its quality. Felt more like a movie special for tom holland instead of a side series that marvel did for loki, wandavision, wintersoldier, and hawkeye. Basically the same quality and effort except instead of a series you got a movie with nostalgia.It was still a solid film to watch but not exactly top tier from marvel. Still loved the nostalgic parts though! They might have carried this movie but it worked!", "Joyous Entertainment": "TBH I thought I was all Marvelled out. Done. Dosed up to the gills with super heroes. Nope. This was DOPE. One of the best super hero films I have seen. Really outrageously fun, funny and pack full of thrills, spills and even a few surprises.Watch it. Enjoy it.", "Mid 8/10": "Although this movie has some horrible pacing, especially in the film's first half, where some scenes feel so abrupt, with that said, this movie slaps harder than me testing a fresh watermelon. I don't want to go in-depth cause there is a lot to unpack in this film. So I will say that this is one of the best Spider-Man adaptations and one of the most important. This movie has an excellent balance of humor and tragedy, heroism and villainy, and the vast characters this film brings. If this rating/review is about portraying the challenges a hero encounters and the actions they must make, and how they portrayed Peter Parker so well, this movie would be a 10/10. Without a doubt.", "Severely overrated. Bad Plot.": "The only reason this movie made so much is because of nostalgia. ONLY NOSTALGIA. The movie without Tobey, Andrew, and DaFoe would be so bad. Even if they were never anticipated and the movie had the same plot, it would easily be one of the worst movies ever.", "Great Escapist fun and entertaining": "My Review - Spider-Man : No Way Home\nMy Rating 8/ 10I've never seen a queue like this one at our local regional Blue Mountains Cinema so it looks like this new Spider-Man movie will be a Box Office bonanza . It certainly needs to be as the estimated Production Budget was an obscene $200 million USDollars .I rated the previous Spider-Man: Far From Home a very respectable 8/10 as I enjoyed it immensely.This movie is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and is the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\nSpider-Man: No Way Home (2021) takes place directly after the events of Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019). Meaning that it takes place in the Spring/Fall of 2024.With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange for help. When a spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear, forcing Peter to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man.The ingredient I enjoy most in this Marvel franchise and there's a lot of comic book humour in Spider-Man or as I think this one should really be titled Spider-Men. No spoilers but I enjoyed the second half of this long movie more than the first especially when Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire form the formidable trio of Arachnids.It's amazing to me where original quotes from Spider-Man show up and are used by other cultural iconic personalities I didn't realise that Ru Paul's often used quote \"With great power comes great responsibility, which Queen \ud83d\udc51 have you chosen to get the CHOPPED? Is a proverb popularized by the Spider-Man comic books written by Stan Lee and published by Marvel Comics\nOf course the CGI effects are the best State of the Art but I think it's the great ensemble cast that makes these films so entertaining including the Actor of the moment Benedict Cumberbatch as the Wizard Dr Stange . I particularly enjoyed Zendayer as Peter Parker's girlfriend she has some great moments with Tom Holland (Spider-Man) and she's delightfully natural.Tom Holland helped to save this movie from cancellation by forcing renegotiations between Sony and Disney. Under the terms of the new deal, not only does Spider-Man: No Way Home still take place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but Spider-man can also appear in future MCU movies, as well as Sony's own Spider-Man franchise.If Sci Fi Action is your favourite movie genre you'll probably rate this latest Marvel movie higher than my quite high 8/10 Rating but I thought it a bit dull in parts and a tad too long 20minutes longer than Spider-Man : Far from Home which I enjoyed more and that movie only cost a mere $140 million estimated budget to make.Great Escapism Movie - Well done.", "A Bad Direction": "It's been a while since a movie felt like a complete waste of time. There are so many existing stories which could be adapted yet they went with this. The popularity of this is depressing. The multiverse is ridiculous. The number of villains were ridiculous, The dialog of the 3 spider-men was rather bad at points. The McGuire Spider-man tells the Garfield Spider-man that he is amazing repeatedly. That was such a call-back to the previous movie titles that it motivated me to take a bathroom break.Since there are going to be multiple movies with multiverse as a key plot device, I am ending my interest in the MCU.", "MCU has officially mastered the art of saying goodbyes.": "This is 20 years worth of emotions all packed into one neat 2 hours 15 minutes package. To have this many characters and pull off a project this beautifully is a feat of a whole new level! I especially like the parts where 3 spidermans comes together as a team, Tobey and Andrew becoming the big brothers and providing the much needed guidance to Tom. Tobey even acting as the senior most and guiding Andrew through relationships and the best part Tobey putting himself between Tom and goblin to prevent Tom from running into the path of vengeance. I've seen the movie twice in 12 hours but couldn't shake the emotions I felt for the three of them the first time. The end kinda felt like we're saying our goodbyes to all three of them, which is a massive tear jerker, it also felt Miles Morales, Gwen Stacy will be stepping into the sony universe of spiderman pretty soon.", "It's fun, full of chuckles and very meta. BUT a little perspective please.": "As I've said in some of my past reviews, some people only know two ratings, either a 1 or a 10.When every review, I see, is putting out a 10/10, perhaps one should step back and get some perspective. This isn't The Godfather!If you've enjoyed Holland's other outings, you will enjoy this.The trailer gives you clues as to what to expect AND I would strongly suggest you watch all previous Spider-Man films (the Sam Raimi versions and the \"amazing Spider-Man\" versions).It'll help.First of, the film is certainly fun and funny. Lot's of jokes and in jokes.There is some lag though. There is whole 10 minute scene in Happy's apartment that plods a little but then we're back to it.I think of all the previous Spider-Man relationships, Hollands and Zendya's is the most believable (well that may well be as they are a couple in real life).The film is sort of like a sweet nostalgia trip.There are a few questions, we as the audience needed answering and which are even asked in the film, but the answers are never given. Despite that, it does a very good job of resolving a lot and putting to bed a number of issues from past films.I have said nothing of the plot nor do I intend to.The reason you are reading this review is either you want to understand why I didn't give it a 10/10 and therefore why am I not fanboying over it or you genuinely want to know whether it's worth seeing in the cinema.The answer to the first question is that it's a very good film but it won't make my top 10 of all time. There is a lot thrown at this and a lot of it sticks but some of it doesn't quite hit the mark.The answer to the second question is well it depends on the cinema.My advise is that you go see it a big screen, good seating, social distanced cinema. You want that cinematic experience.I went to an multiplex with people sitting next to each other in a reasonably packed theatre with a screen which, frankly by today's standard, was bog standard to small (which surprised me considering the calibre of film being shown),So yeah, go see it (especially if you've seen all the previous ones) but on a grand big old screen cinema with comfortable seating.Enjoy.", "One word to describe this film? Childhood.": "Unreal.This is the kind of film where I felt like it was both an honor and a privilege to watch it.I grew up watching the original Spider-Man movies. I never really got into Tom Holland's Spider-Man, but I'm not sure if any future Spider-Man movies will ever be able to top this.I haven't watch many, nor do I really care about the other Avengers and their respective movies, but this is a must watch for Spider-Man fans.I'm going out of my way to review this movie, a review which maybe no one will read, but I need to get some of this awe off my chest.", "Spider-Man swings to victory": "Out of all the MCU Spider-Man films, this is the one that surpasses the others by miles. Homecoming was a fun flick after Civil War, but it felt too simple. FFH should have waited to come out after Endgame by another couple months. This film is a Spider-Man fanboy's dream. The performances are really well done, the chemistry between the Peters is great, and the Venom cameo was pretty good. However, the first third of the film was simple and rushed. Overall, it's a must-see and it's the best film in Phase 4, which is a lot because most Phase 4 films aren't great nowadays.", "Meh": "I have not enjoyed the movie at all, in honesty I watched it in two parts because it didn't make sense.Q1 - how did Spiderman let the villains out of the cells?Q2 - if Dr Strange is in control of the Mirror World why did it take him a lot of time to go out of it?Q3 - if something is happening to the universe why is noone trying to help\nQ4 - do you find it believable that all anyone needs to transform a reptile or a sandman back to a man can be found in a school lab?Q5 - why were the other two Spidermen added, Dr Strange said that the spell pulled people desiring Spiderman, so why would any Spiredman desire himself?Q6 - Mysterio said who is Spiderman, not where he lives, how did the tv found out so fast?Q7 - why are there so many positive reviews, the movie was drenched in CGI, the sequences with no CGI were not believable to be real and all looked like a set!", "A penultimate love story between spider man and spider man": "Out of all the reboots, this movie made me laugh the most. It was a much sadder story. My favorite part of the entire experience is how the stakes were high the entire time. Not a single minute of this movie is boring or predictable.It felt a lot like endgame in the way the story is wrapped up nicely. Please go see this in theaters, it's an amazing experience.", "BEST FILM EVER MADE": "This film was emotional with happiness sadness and all the other emotions jon watts knows how to make an amazing spiderman film it should be better when i see it monday or tuesday.", "Great, very great": "Excellent superhero film with such an exciting story, crazy action phases, beautiful music and in addition to ancient historical characters are back to the delight of the spectator.", "The Spiderman film you always wanted": "After leaving the cinema it dawned on me what I'd just watched a film that should have been lost through inter studio politics and there greedy hands but what we have is quite possible the zenith of all superheroes movies. I honestly didn't think Avengers:Endgame would ever be equaled as a grand MCU movie but this just puts everything before it in the shade, maybe it's because Spiderman is such a beloved superheroe? Maybe it's the imperious special effects? Maybe it's the supporting cast? Who knows but this is the Spider-Man movie you always wanted\nOnly thing left to ponder is will Sony and Marvel/Disney see the potential of working together to give the money paying public more of this kind of collaboration or will the dollar signs get in the way.", "The Best Spiderman movie of all Time!!!!": "It's the best Spiderman film I have ever seen in my entire life!!! Also one of the best comic book films . It's Dark emotional and suspenseful at the same time . Tom holland was just amazing . Must watch!!!!", "No words": "Perfection. I'm very rarely left with no words, and yet here I am. It felt like it as giving me a childhood gift. Growing up with the first Spider-Man, I felt completed in a way I didn't know I needed. Wept, laughed, healed. Truly the reason I love the cinema.", "Welcome again to the spider-verse": "I highly enjoyed Spider-Man: No Way Home. It was a great culmination of all three properties of the Spider-Man franchise blending Sam Raimi's Spider-Man universe, along with Marc Webb's Spider-Man universe, into the Marvel Cinematic Universe into Marvels famed \"Multiverse\". My only real quarrel with the film was that it spent too much time re-introducing the characters we already knew from previous movies and now timelines. All the character performances were superb and endearing.", "This is a sad film for the Spider-Man Saga": "The best movies hands down were with Tobey McGuire. Everything after the first has been a downhill mess. I don't understand the great reviews for this movie, I feel movie taste has really gone down for Marvel Movies. The plot was terrible, just a mess of random things happening with throwing a bunch of popular actors from the previous movies together. For the record, i also think the whole avengers saga is a CGI catastrophe so if you are a big fan of those types of Marvel movies, then you definitely won't agree with this review.The main Spider-Man character in this movie is shallow and plays on a lot of the plot from some of the originals, the aunt dies, he greaves, etc. Also, he tries to \"save\" the bad guys and convert them into good guy, come one how sappy is that.Not much more to say, I would not waste my money on it. If you want to see a new movie, opt for Top Gun Maverick, a decent sequel to the original.", "THEY DID IT.": "The best Spider Man movie starting from the story line to the action the drama the emotions ,a visual treat for all the MCU/spiderman fans\nA great way to end the year 2021\nIts a must watch not just once but atleast 5 times..", "Spider-Man goes beyond his Universe": "In the vast world of the Avengers, the appearance of Spider-Man performed by Tom Holland was greeted very warmly. The young hero is very much loved all over the world, and the successful Infinity Saga, which was just gaining momentum, was replenished with a famous character to please the public. Two solo albums followed, which were well received by the audience. Well, the announcement of the third film about Parker's life and his meeting with heroes from other universes raised interest in the upcoming film to the skies, perfectly playing on the fact that even fans of films with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield will also be interested in the project. The option really turned out to be a win-win, while giving the audience another high-quality story.The plot plot, however, looks kind of ridiculous, implicates Doctor Strange here. The magician and the magician reacts to Peter's request, in my opinion, somehow not in an adult way. But we all understand that if the magician had refused the young Spider, the story would not have happened at all (although everything is difficult here because of other projects, including Loki and Wanda/ Vision). Nevertheless, a certain solution triggers a chain of events that demonstrate a lot of interesting content on the screen.It cannot be said that the film was created exclusively for fans. The story is strong and allows Tom Holland's Peter Parker to grow up, rising to a new level. The dramatic events that meet the audience during the narration necessarily affect the personality of the young Spider, perfectly demonstrating that he will have to answer for any of his decisions on his own. He is no longer a teenager, and the stakes are high, often it's human lives. And if you have decided to act the way you acted, then be ready to answer for the consequences, even if it hurt your heart unbearably.This film shows well who and how of the characters moves further along their storyline. There are a lot of heroes and villains here, whose fate is really interesting to know. Well, the great trinity will definitely make you not only smile, but also worry about the fate of everyone, especially in the finale of the story. Viewers will see a reverent and respectful attitude towards the previous Spider-Man franchises. The presented characters will tell how they lived at a time that we have not been able to see on the screen, they will tell, it seems, everything that is needed to ensure that the audience has a general picture of their worlds.However, do not forget that this is still a film about the current Spider-Man. The picture will be focused on it. Holland has surpassed himself in terms of acting. A young man together with his hero turns from a teenager into a young man who is ready to live as an adult and independent person, having left the custody of older comrades. Finally, you begin to understand that in future tapes he will no longer need mentors, such as Tony Stark, Nick Fury, Happy Hogan or Stephen Strange. And after the end credits, you catch yourself thinking that the trilogy about the guy that happened is just the teenage period of Spider-Man. And the potential of his individual future stories is very great.\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" has become a great blockbuster. It has everything you need for a successful movie. The stars have converged. The successful, but recently stalling Marvel cinematic universe has given fans of the past and present a really worthwhile project. The creators have successfully entered into their Fourth phase about the Multiverse a strong project that is directly related to it, and also thanks to an uncomplicated plot gave the world the opportunity to plunge into the past and see the heroes and villains they have loved for a long time, literally breathing new life into long-familiar images. All this made it possible to earn an excellent box office, prepare the ground for future projects about Spider-Man, and, most importantly, reminded and even taught young viewers important things. It is necessary to be responsible for every adult independent decision. Take it on your shoulders, learn from mistakes and understand that every person has them, even if it's Spider-Man.After all, \"the greater the power, the greater the responsibility.\"8 out of 10.", "The best part of this movie is...": "...the end credit teasers.I know, I know. I shouldn't expect so much from a comic book movie, but I wanted more. I wanted better.This is a very big \"fan boy\" movie, so I understand why so many people are gushing over it. However, for me I found it:boringway too longnot very funnylacking an interesting plottoo many \"villains\" for one moviehaving really bad CGI (in some parts)The audience clapped every time (insert some character from a past movie) appeared on screen. That's fine, but that shouldn't be the whole substance of the movie.I liked the scenes with Dr. Strange more than the scenes with Spider-Man. Unfortunately, Dr. Strange isn't in the movie very much.If you like a lot of call backs to other movies, then you'll love this film. If you want more than a surface-level story, then you may be wanting more after seeing this movie.", "Gotta love Peter Parkers": "I had no idea what to expect from this movie. The couple reviews I heard had only mentioned that No Way Home was \"surprising\". I was ready to be disappointed to say the least. However I quite enjoyed it. For awhile many people have wondered how the individual spider man movies fit into the same narrative and how they conceptualized it was impressive. Not to mention the fact that they were able to get the original actors from the other spider man movies.. Absolutely loved the banter between the spider men and the loyalty they had for their own story within their respective universe. I also liked the set up for continuation with another Doctor Strange movie. I hope we can see more of him in the future.", "Great movie but could be better in some ways!": "I thought going into it that it was going to be a good movie. Unfortunately people spoiled that Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire where going to be in it and they were just, didn't know when they were going to be in what scene. It was a great movie and when those two other Spider-Man came out my theatre ereputed with cheers and I have never seen so many people cheer or shout since Avengers Endgame and it was amazing. This movie was definitely the best Spider-Man movie they have made and definitely beats the other two Tom Holland Spider-Man films. I do wish we would have seen them mention the name \"Sinsister Six\" as if you know the comics you would know what that means but it was nice too see villains from all three franchises just wish we would have saw more and more dialogue with them and there Spider-Man's. Side note would have been a 10/10 if they put more Daredevil in the movie more and not just one scene but overall 8/10. Overall great movie just need some minor changes.", "Wow": "I'm going to watch it all over again and again and again. What a crazy script, acting, villans, characters, cast, crew just how crazy is everything about the film. Wow wow wow.", "Ultimate fan service": "This movie was absolutely phenomenal!It was everything you want as a fan and more.I love how they introduced the multiverse in this and what it will bring in the future.I really like that they \"changed\" the uncle ben story. We have seen Aunt May in three films and that made it extra emotional.Seeing Tobey and Andrew was amazing and the chemistry's between the three of them was great. It gave me chills seeing all the Spider-Man at the same time.It was like a love note to my childhood!!!", "Shut up and pay the ticket": "Best Spider-Man movie ever. Among the beat blockbusters of all time. Great acting. Great vfx. Do you want anything else? Go and watch itWe need amazing 3.", "Very Entertaining": "This movie although over two hours long went by in a flash. There's not much more I can really add to what everyone has already said. There's lots of action in this movie and the dialogue was funny and not to over the top. Loved how even though this movie was told from more of a gen-z perspective, older Marvel fans will not feel disconnected from it.", "Can a Spider-Man come out to play": "Wow, one of the best marvel movies ever, it has the action, it has the emotions and it's a beautiful movie start to end, a little slow at the start but it seriously finds its footing after about 25 minutes!!I actually felt something with this movie that other marvel movies failed to deliver, It is a love letter to Spider-Man and all the fans, a great spidey movie and even better movie.I understand why it's making so much money, I don't think this movie is just nostalgia bait, it uses it to empower the story even further, I have seen it 3 times and in every watch THAT SCENE still has me in awe, also can we appreciate how amazing willem Dafoe was in this movie !!!", "This movie was awesome.": "I love this movie. I never thought I would see three Spiderman going against one of the OG villains from the previous Spider-Man. This film was fun and surprising and I'm glad to see this in opening night. The only flaw I had is that I wish we had a little more storytelling to it but the Aunt May Death was very emotional and it did feel a little rush to me. Overall, Best Spider-Man movie along with Sam Rami Spider-Man 2!", "Marvel continue their hot streak of epic blockbusters": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is the latest blockbuster to arrive from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Spider-man's identity is revealed to be Peter Parker, whose life gets turned upside down, and he is faced with his greatest challenge yet.No Way Home is a great superhero film filled with amazing action, heart-wrenching emotional scenes, and incredible surprises. If you have watched Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame you will see many similarities. Both in the sheer scope of the film and in the epic nature in which it unfolds. In my theater the audience erupted several times, cheering and applauding.The action is hard-hitting and significantly more violent than previous Spider-Man movies from Marvel which adds something new and great to this film. The story is also great which both makes for an amazing movie and it paves the way for plenty of great movies to come. The movie also features the best performance from Tom Holland yet. He is finally coming into his own as Spider-Man and it is honestly amazing to see.Go see this movie immediately. Do your best not to get spoiled and see it in the cinema. You won't be disappointed. Spider-Man: No Way Home is the greatest Spider-Man movie I've ever seen and one of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen as well. Overall a great film and I can't wait to see where the Marvel Cinematic Universe goes next.", "The most amazing Spiderman.": "I'm not going to lie, having heard so many great things about this film made me a little dissapointed during the first hour of this film. Sure, it was enjoyable but I was expecting something spectacular waiting anxiously on the edge of my seat. But, in the end i was so far from dissapointed. This movie truly has everything a good \"superhero\" movie can have. Lots of great friendship and love scenes, fight scenes and those really, really intense scenes. But the thing that makes this movie stand out the most is because spiderman carries the sense of humanity. This movie made me cry, laugh, irritated and even a little bit angry sometimes and that's what makes it so great. The emotions made it the best spiderman movie so far. One moment that really made me cry was when Garfield (spiderman 3) catches MJ, not wanting Holland (spiderman 1) to feel the same sorrow he felt for Gwen. I also feel like you get the most out of this movie if you've watched all of the spiderman movies made, it gets you really sentimental.If you haven't seen this movie yet then you really have to as soon as you can, one of the best movies i've seen this year.", "It really doesn't worth the time and money": "VFX and sound is awesome as always. However, the story is forgettable and hard to relate. Peter is very annoying for the whole first act and although he's there for the second and third act, somehow his presence disappears. I watched it on IMAX just to see if I'd enjoy it fully, but nope. I'd prefer Eternals over this one. There are some emotional moments that are nicely done. You feel the heartbreak for sure. Some moments on the other hand feels fake. Dr. Octopus talks too much that he becomes annoying as well. And I'll never understand why Peter lets them all out from the prison at once.", "Mostly terrible": "Unless you're 12 or a huge fan of all things Marvel (regardless if it's good or not), I don't see how this was enjoyable. The plot was horrible with more holes than Swiss cheese, and there were dozens of references that make no sense to anyone that doesn't have a Master's degree in Marvel Comics. Everyone the great cast couldn't save this mess.It felt like a good 80's cartoon mixed with a terrible 80's cheesy movie, but darker.", "No good deed goes unpunished": "Remember when they killed off Emma Stone?Spider-man requests Dr. Strange cast a spell to make everyone forget who he was except a few people. As a result villains who he has killed return from across the multiverse. You are expected to know string theory. Their return causes havoc and Spider-man must find a way to cure them before Dr. Strange kills them.In the grand scheme of things, Marvel has gone out of its way to explain the other Spider-man movies when no one really wanted or expected one. Having saved the universe a few times, I am glad to Marvel coming down to Earth and back to the basics without attempting to top each episode.", "Disappointing": "I was so excited to see it.

Hoping the next one will rise to the expectations of a Marvel movie.", "I guess sony keeps the mouse in check": "I'm not sure this would have been the same type of film if it was total marvel control...But thankfully we got something special. I was not a endgame.. and none of of the other marvel films or series since.. Shang Chi is probably the best before this film, and that one sits in the lower tier of great marvel films ever made... This one is up there right next to infinity war, the first iron man and other great marvel films..\nI wish Stan Lee was here to see this film. He would have loved it.", "Best live action Spider-Man movie ever made": "Yes, that statement is really bold, thinking about the original 2 but I can firmly say that it is true, Spider-Man No Way Home is the best movie of the whole entire year, yes, even better than Zack Snyder's Justice League.I can't believe they actually did it.This film is the perfect culmination of everything leading up to this point, the performances are unforgettable, Molina and Holland give the best performances I've ever seen from them, they are unbelievable here.Dafoe is perfect, his performance is haunting.This film has the best action sequences since The Avengers, the direction was insane, mind-blowing really.But it's not just that, it takes risks, I will not spoil anything for you, but this movie touches all the heartstrings.Cumberbatch is incredible in this, even better than usual.Also, it is one of the funniest films Marvel has ever made, every line spoken fits perfectly.They did such an amazing job bringing everyone back, and the special effects were exquisite, as I've come to expect from Marvel.I loved every single second, it's a mind-blowing, exhilarating ride from start to finish, I will be seeing it again in theaters, 2 and a half hours never felt so short and entertaining, I didn't want it to stop.I'll just get what you know is coming out of the way, I'm gonna give Spider-Man No Way Home an A+.I will be remembering it for years.", "A neat fan-service": "Tom Holland's version of Peter Parker is still the most annoying of them all. But apparently, it works as a plot device in his third so-called solo outing, Spider-Man: Way Home.The film's sole purpose is fan service and ties any loose ends neatly. So neat that we tend to overlook the so many coincidences and/or conveniences that occur in its plot.Nonetheless, kudos to Jon Watts for executing an enjoyable feast that will satisfy any Spider-Man fan from every universe.", "zendaya ruins the movie": "Worst spider-man movie yet, Zendaya is so annoying i couldn't even watch it . She can't act and ruins the film with her cutesy ness that is clearly fake. They should have chose another actress because she is terrible.", "Wish-Fulfillment All the Way": "An absolute banger of a Spider-Man movie. Hard to tell if it's better than the excellence of Spider-verse, but very much brings the entirety of the live action Spider-Man films to fruition. Loved so much in this film that would have sounded silly on paper but worked SO well on screen.", "With great powers comes a great film": "I give infinite credit to the writers and producers at Sony (and Disney). They knew exactly what the fans wanted and likewise expected; and No Way Home delivers beyond the enormous hype. Not since Captain America wielded Thor's hammer in Endgame has a cinema erupted with such joy and vivacious cheering.And never have I smiled so much: NWH is bursting with delightful chemistry, Easter eggs, truly impeccable fan service and a never ending supply of fun and emotion in equal measure, all of which helps to elevate NWH in becoming the most joyous and ambitious entry in the MCU thus far.Spider Man has truly become something of an icon; and No Way Home, if nothing else, is a jubilant celebration of Peter Parker and his alter ego, including both his comic and onscreen iterations (past and present).9.5/10.", "Ultimate!! Amazing!! Spectacular!!": "One of Mcu's Best Movies By Far Heartwarming yet Heartbreaking, Do Yourselves a Favor Skip The Trailers Go In Blind and Enjoy It It's Funny and TTragic... The Only Problem I Had Was The End Credit Not Going To Spoil It But It Left Me Puzzled, Other Than That It Was a Brilliant Movie Great Cast Story and CGI Loved It..", "Call it a fan service, but for me it was a movie delivery of life time.": "This movie is a treat for those who have been watching and loving spider movies since past two decades. Nostalgic factor is turned up to ultimate level.Hats off to the creative team for piecing the idea for this movie and making it happen.This movie is for the fans, by the fans.", "Time for a change": "It tries too hard to smart and funny.This is my least favourite Spidey move - by a big margin.I re-watched the original Spider-Man with Toby McGuire and everything just clicks with that movie.I genuinely don't think there's anywhere to go with this MCU incarnation of Spidey - and Holland, although a good actor, can't compete with McGuire's dorkiness.Time for change.", "Brilliant climax to the Tom Holland trilogy": "An amazing collection of moments from 20 years worth of Spider Man movies. A brilliant cast with loads of fan service!A small criticism would be that it is a little unbelievable how the Villians cross multiverses as the entire problems of the film could have been resolved with a simple conversation between Peter and Doctor Strange.But overall a brilliant film.", "Far too long and far too little of what makes Spidey great": "This is my small voice about this movie. It Iooks like it made great bucks for the studio which is fine.But renting this, I'm glad I didn't sit through it in a theater. It's very very long and laborious and doesn't, to me, concentrate on what makes Spidey great.Spider-Man is charming because he's a kid, like other kids, but burdened with a super power.This extreme world ending, world shattering stuff is so heavy and extreme.Maybe I'm old fashioned, but maybe even a feature film could still be about a kid struggling to solve local real world problems?", "A masterful, emotional roller-coaster": "\"Where do we go from here?\" is the biggest question I have after leaving the cinema. The possibilities are endless both for Spiderman and the MCU as a whole.Firstly, this movie absolutely delivers on so many levels. So often, the hype for a film could leave you disappointed but not this one. Fan service is at the very core of No Way Home but at the same time it ties in beautifully to what we're seeing with this new phase of MCU projects.With all the craziness, epic moments, secrets and reveals, I was worried this movie will take the attention away from Tom Holland's Spiderman but if anything it just adds to his story arch and sets up an amazing potential future for the character. I honestly can't wait to see what comes next for Spiderman and Peter Parker. Holland does a fantastic job and we really get to see just how good of an actor he is in this movie. No Way Home is filled with fantastic visuals and plenty of emotion, and in classic MCU style, thrilling action, your usual one liners and (not always, but definitely in this film) a storyline that keeps the Marvel steam train running at full force.There are many scenes in this film that will leave long time Spidey fans feeling like a kid again and is exactly what you'd expect it to be. The feeling of joy, nostalgia, excitement and to some extent, relief, was truly magical and I'm forever grateful to have experienced it. It would be extremely difficult to ever witness something like this on the big screen again. Thank you Marvel, and thank you Sony.In my opinion, there are some areas in the film 's storyline where it suffers a bit. Some of the character's decisions are a bit Strange (no pun intended) in parts with certain events being questionable. But then again, that's the tricky part with these films. It's science fiction and you can never read too much into the details. Sometimes its best to just accept it for what it is, which in this case, is an epic superhero adventure.Despite the VERY minor questionable plot details, No Way Home is undoubtedly a phenomenal film that will go down as one of the greatest superhero films of all time. It is a true love letter to Spiderman fans and an event that will surely open up a multitude of possibilities for the MCU.", "YOU HAVE THE AVENGERS \"GREAT\" - WHATS THAT?": "Rip roaring web spinning adventure that catapults Peter Parker into a fully pledged Spider-Man , Peter seeks help from one of his Amazingly Strange friends when he realises the value of a secret identity but medalling in ancient secrets soon gives Peters alter ego a lot more to contemplate. The Avengers are all but diminished and the new Avengers are being shaped for what seems to be formidable challenges ahead as we enter into a Multi Verse of the Universe were what came before will seem like a drop in the ocean on more levels than one. Very enjoyable great concept and brilliant cinematic magic, I was losing hope for this genre but it seems we have turned a corner lately and I have enjoyed The Ten Rings and this Spider-Man a lot more so I say more of the same please.......", "Great Movie! Best MCU Spider-Man story": "This movie is great. It really is great. This movie have a lot of villians but that doesn't hurt it not at all. I must say by far the best MCU spider-man film to date. They handle the question of revenge so great I think. The ending is just yeah phenomenal. I don't even know what to say barely left the theater before I started to write this both Tobey and Andrew back. (sorry Nicholas Hammond maybe next time). If you love any of the 2 previous versions you will most likely love this movie since there are a bunch of references and actors from those are returning back. Peter Parker also have good character growth at the end of the movie he doesn't feel like a kid anymore. He feel a lot mroe mature and finally is standing on his own legs. It is great watch it if you haven't. Honestly you shouldn't even read this if you haven't watched it.", "The best of all worlds": "Wow, this was phenomenal. Combining the best bits of all Spider-Man universes and then having a solid story and gravitas. It has the villains from Toby Spider-Man, Garfield as Spider-Man and Holland and Cumberbatch from the current Spider-Man. I can't stress enough how good this is. Possibly the best marvel movie to date.", "Impressive": "This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman. I loved every second of it!", "Greatest of the Tom Holland Spiderman Franchise, By A Mile!": "A certified crowd pleaser, No Way Home had me grinning from ear to ear with my finger pointed at the screen far too often. It is definitely my favorite of the Tom Holland films, and a shade under Spiderman 2 as the best one yet. To see Alfred Molina, William Dafoe and Jamie Foxx reprising their roles, was INSANE. Each of their entrances caused goosebumps and their acting, pure nostalgia! Props to Dafoe! His voice and facial expressions remains perfect for the Goblin 20 years later. Really, the reality where we see these characters together is unthinkable, yet here we have it, and the film ensures its more than fan service! Spiderman, choosing to 'cure' gives these characters a shot at the main theme of the film, redemption. This brings us to the grandest (& most spoiled) reveal in recent years, the appearance of the other Spidermen! It is difficult to comprehend and put into words the feeling of seeing Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield suit up. Filmmakers even graces its fans by showing PLENTY of these Parkers as they play huge roles in the third act, complimenting the emotional themes of the film. In fact, my favorite redemption story arch was that of Andrew's. I was blown away by how invested he was. When he caught Zendaya's MJ, his outpour of raw emotions sent shivers down my spine. It was gratifying to see the filmmakers give him justice. Another positive is we finally have a mature version of Tom Holland's Spidey. We see his mistakes and struggles to confront its consequences, themes of a grounded and relatable superhero we love and admire.All positives mentioned, the film does have shortcomings in its plot. There were moments I feel unnecessary like Aunt May's demise, Sandman's motivation and everything Ned. The premise that 'too many requests' during the spell casting ushered the multiverse crisis had a weak hold on me, and to blame it on Spiderman was a head scratcher. The film does however, a tremendous job of giving us things to love to overcome these holes. The sheer volume of iconic characters is a remarkable feat no one thought possible.Spiderman: No Way Home is then, a well packaged present as it delivers what both hardcore and casual fans want and desire. And for that, I give a score of 8.5/10.", "the 2nd best marvel movie...": "The runner up is spider-man: no way homei remember about all of the rumors considering goblin (dafoe), doc ock (Molina), electro (foxx), lizard (ifaans), sand-man (haden-church), and of course peter and peter's return (garfield)(maguire)i was scared for the film if they didn't show up and i'm so happy they did. I will remember the theater moment i had when these iconic characters returned and i'm excited that venom can now be in the mcu thanks to Hardy's adaptationbenedict provides another stunning performance as doctor strange (i'm slowly believing he will be the new \"robert downey jr.\" of the mcu.", "BRILLIANT!!": "So, i went to see this movie and i was shocked. I was not expecting it to be this good. The way holland portrayed spider man in this movie is immaculate. The special effects were so detailed and mesmerizing. The soundtrack for the movie was absolutely stunning. Not to mention the way andrew garfield and tobey maguire were able to come back for the final part. This movie and endgame are a very close tie, and this movie is definitely gonna be in the marvel books. I would 10/10 recommend you watch this movie! You wont regret it!!", "It is amazing movie": "Spider man in this movie definitely different super hero\nI like MCU the forth act it's so powerful start\nI many people they think is the movie offer good.", "No Way Home Run!": "LIKES:The Special Effects:\nDisney's resources can be used to craft amazing pieces, and No Way Home shows just how much of the good stuff they have when they put their time and money to it. Spiderman's dive into the multiverse is beautiful on almost all fronts in both design and animation. Dazzling displays of light, color, flashing, and explosions are blended together to make exciting, comic book feeling moments, all while getting hit with darker layers as the fight progresses. Spiderman facing the various villains seen in the trailer are fantastic, as web slinging, dodging, and various blasting occurs to rock the screen with amazing, theater rumbling effects. It's a very cinema worthy movie for this alone, but there is so much more to it.The Comedy:\nDisney is all about cramming the jokes into the movie to lighten things up, and sometimes they take it too far. Fortunately, No Way Home manages to keep the comedy in check, timing things at the opportune moments and hitting running gags to keep us ingrained in the MCU Spiderverse. The banter was mostly kept in check, each of the characters styles blended well together with awesome chemistry, and even better it was not too much to trip up the emotional moments this movie has, which is a fantastic balance for this reviewer.The Action:\nFor the most part, the fights and chases in this movie feel very much like something from the Marvel comic universe. Taking that classic Spiderman taunting, while implementing strategy, agility, and use of environment, led to some decent moments that were suspenseful and interesting to see what damage would be caused. As the movie's tone changed, the nature of the fights changed too to keep pace, and by the end it was an amazing blend of comedic, action, and emotion to paint a near perfect finale for me.The Acting:\nAgain, Marvel casted well in this movie and opens up so many great chemistry networks between the characters that were in this movie. Holland is still a wonderful blend of Peter Parker and Spiderman, who has taken the character again to further heights and pulls the character through the ringer. This movie puts the main character into the ringer and Holland does things so well to really grab that emotion and pull at your heart strings. Zendaya's quality still shines through, and her rendition of M. J. still holds the same core foundation, but starts to further evolve and grow the seeds planted at the end of Far From Home. Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange is top notch as usual, he's fun, he's classy, and he really sets the stage for the future of the character in this bizarre multiverse being set up and is exciting to see this transition layering more onto the character. Jacob Betalon as Ned again rocks in the comedy moment, but also extends to some other moments that were again perfect for the story. Alfred Molena, reprises the role of Doc Oc super well, bringing the same narcissism intellect of the character, but diving back into the complexity of the character we had in the second movie. There are so many more to compliment, but I can't due to potential for spoilers, but rest assure that the chemistry between this cast is a mixture of quality.Handling the Characters Well:\nSpiderman: No Way Home had a lot of balls to juggle and for me, they did it quite well with the material they had to present. Extending the story from the end of the last movie, while mixing in Strange felt very natural, with adequate time spent listing out the problems and solutions the two \"Avengers\" had to find for the spell that went wrong. And once that door was opened, the complexity of the story required a lot more planning and direction. Watts and the team succeeded, managing to keep a lot of characters in the mix and making sure their inclusion was meaningful past the simple marketing for toys. Even the villains get some decent balance, again bringing their own interactions and plot components that for the most part were not forced or counteractive. It was a fantastic display of coordination and effort and given the potential disaster this could have been, I'm very much happy with the results.The Emotional Heart:\nThese movies and characters mean the world to the fans, and that means crossing into the heartstring pulling territory. No Way Home hits this several times, and I loved the moral testing components that they wrote in here for so many characters. Diving deeper into these characters, we got past the simple good-guy vs. Bad-guy motif and instead got something much bigger that again justified the inclusion of so many things. This is certainly one of the clutch moments of the MCU and I dare say it was something that sets so much up for the rest of the wave.DISLIKES:Pacing at the beginning:\nIt's all about the set up and making sure we are ready for everything to happen in the movie. As such, that was the part of the movie that I found to be a little drawn out and boring at times for me. I don't know if I was just tired, or I was hoping for a little more movement or suspense and it took about the first thirty minutes before the first fight really kicked in. Once that happened, the pacing issues were very minor at that point, only going a bit fast a few times in how some of the twists were brought in.The Computer work at times:\nAs much as I enjoyed the special effects and CGI, I can't say that it was flawless. No Way Home does have moments where the computer look reared its head and took shortcuts into the less realistic looking realm. The very artificial movements, the digital look to the skin, and a few other moments did drop into the lower resolution. Again, a minor flaw for me, but something I have seen in the past get fans upset.The Action at Times:\nThere are times where the fighting really started to ramp up, finding a great pace and stride that was gearing up for a great Spiderman brawl. However, the action would then trip and lose that momentum with an abrupt ending. There were great moments where they achieved all those incredible fighting sequences, but there were times I would have liked a little more coordination and magic that we had with other films, especially at the end with the way they were solving some problems. It feels like they were running out of time and some cuts were made to offset the full coordination, but again this is still a nitpick moment for picking on to find the answer.Some of the Bad Guys Needed A Little More:\nDoc Oc as I said earlier was a fantastic villain they did so much with and Green Goblin as well has the bite that feels like an extension of the classic character. However, the Lizard and Sandman (which have been seen in the trailers), felt a little more time was needed to further expand upon their characters more and give them the same bite they held long ago. I know the reasons they were brought in for the most part, but... there still could have been some more fun with them to help get a little more mojo and time with them would have been amazing.Predictable:\nI got most of the twists they were trying to surprise us with. Lots of foreshadowing handed you the keys to getting the big events that were going to happen and how they were going to help repair the mess they were looking. I can't say that the call of things being a surprise were really a surprise. However, this minor dislike still does not take away from the enjoyment of the movie for me.The VERDICT:\nSpiderman No Way Home achieved a lot of greatness for this reviewer and makes me feel a little more comfortable from what is coming out of Marvel in the future. It's a fun movie that has so much to it and really brings forth an amazing experience meant for viewing in the theater. It's exciting, it's got heart, it's got comedy, and it keeps many things in the air with a balanced manner that was certainly exceeding the expectations that I had going in. No Way Home shows the multiverse may be in good hands and if they can continue this art of balance of new ideas and foundations, then we are in good hands. Sure, there are some pacing issues at time, some simplified solution finding, and a few characters needing a little more time. However, overall, this film is in the top Spiderman movies and I strongly encourage you to see it in the theater if you can find the time.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0\nMovie Overall: 8.0-8.5.", "Best Spiderman Movie": "Lord have mercy, this is one of those movies that as soon as you leave the theater you instantly want to go back in.Best #Spiderman movie ever made. Amazing performance by Tom holland & Willem dafoe. The score was amazing & please for the love of God stay all the way to the second credit! TRUST ME!", "Marvel Studios got Spider-Man right, this time!": "If you love Spider-Man then you'll definitely love this film. Not only does \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" have an amazing script but the characters are written perfectly. Not only will this blockbuster blow your socks off visually and emotionally but it will bring back a lot of needed nostalgia that is a breath of fresh air for Spider-Man fans of all generations.", "Excellent Spiderman Movie": "It was so great to see all the main villains back and all the original actors, plus the three Spidermen and Dr Strange. This was a Marvel happy meal. Spiderman No Way Home was perfect. It was such a treat seeing them all bouncing off each other and Dr Strange. I am not going to go into a synopsis of the movie as there are plenty of reviews doing just that so I don't need to. Needless to say, this is the best of them so far. The performances are brilliant, you can see how much fun everyone is having here. The action is great and it really does ties things up nicely.This is definitely a must see for fans of comic book movies and for people who just love great movies.", "A good fun movie!": "This movie is good like all the other mcu movies I've seen. It's great to see our favorite villains from the previous spider man movies. The ending was a little depressing though.", "Fanboys will have you thinking it's a masterpiece": "But then again they think every Marvel movie is a masterpiece. It's really not that good. Quite boring actually but we can't have any of that. Why tell the truth about the movie when fanboys are hyping the hype? Surely the hype can't be wrong. Ugh, the first SpiderMan was wayyy better. This one just didn't do it for me. Marvel is hit or huge miss and this was definitely a huge miss. Wait for it to come out on streaming. You'll be glad you saved your money.", "The Ultimate Fan Service Movie": "While this third movie in the latest trilogy of Spiderman films will more than placate the fanboys and fangirls out there, it is at a cost. This movie could have easily clocked in at two hours and feel like the perfect blockbuster movie. But no. After the finale, the \"good byes\" stretch on and on. Then of course there is baiting for other upcoming MCU movies. Even the fun jokey jokey scenes that are the hallmark of this franchise get cringe-worthy sometimes. I still give this movie a thumbs up, because it took a concept and found some fun with it. There is a little bit of manipulation, with more than a few tear jerker scenes (really? How many times do you need to push the waterworks?). But the biggest thing this movie has going for it is re-thinking the villains. Instead of the villains arriving and being bad guys, we find a way to make them sympathetic, and the audience will go along with the alternate storyline.I also like Benedict Cumberbatch. He fares well as a secondary character that only appears in the movie every once in a while. At the heart of the success of this current iteration of the Spiderman franchise is the friendship, particularly MJ and Ned. They stay integral to the center of the story quite intentionally, so you feel this is more of an ensemble piece that the previous two movies. However, the expected fan service (rumors are true) takes over and becomes the twist in the story. The concept of multiple universes has been pushed by Marvel for the last couple years, and here it is used as a vehicle for conflicts that arise.So I enjoyed the story, the treatment of the villains, plus the high buck action scenes we expect, and the supporting characters. For that reason, I will declare this film is the best of the three. Just get ready for some tugs at the heart in the third act, where you may find yourself getting a little annoyed that another music cue (the solitary piano notes with the sad violin) is making you well up again.I will give this a 7 out of 10, despite the extra half-hour of hugging.", "Spiderman at it's best.": "I knew about the inclusion of certain characters in this movie and was worried they wouldn't be integrated into this story in a natural way. But I was proven wrong, the plot makes sense and comes to a satisfying conclusion, the pacing is great, the movie really puts Peter through a lot and remains focused on how he deals with these issues, and what being the friendly neighborhood Spider man is all about. Many heartfelt scenes and comedy that hit for the most part makes this among my favorite Spider man movies.", "Perfection.": "Everything I wanted this film to be. It even rivals Into the Spiderverse or Spider-man 2 as best Spider-man film. Go and see it on the big screen! Definitely in the top 3 best marvel films.", "Pretty Darn Good": "Peter Parker, outed as Spider-Man, and framed for Mysterio's death (see previous film), asks Dr Strange to cast a spell to make everyone forget he is Spider-Man. But things go horribly wrong, and the multiverse suddenly gets very real indeed.The trailer reveals the Doctor Octopus from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 makes an appearance, thus linking the MCU with the original Spider-Man franchise, but it is worth watching all 5 pre-MCU movies beforehand because there are moments here which payoff all those movies.This is a very good movie notwithstanding the fan service. It's a good story, the action and effects are first rate, the performances are excellent, and there is a lot of emotion. Far From Home was very good, albeit a more intimate movie after the cosmic goings-on in Infinity War and Endgame, but No Way Home makes it clear that Phase 4 will be as capable of weaving intimate personal issues and massive threats as Phase 3 was.", "With great power comes great responsibility!": "This is it! What a masterpiece watching I remember watching the first Spider-Man at age 7 in cinemas excited not knowing what to expect and was blown away! Here we are almost 20 years later I've never felt so complete watching a film! What a PAYOFF!", "Great experience but do not look too much into it...": "On the surface Spider-Man: No Way Home is highly entertaining, funny and with some heartfelt moments and all contributes to a satisfying view. It is great too see again some old villains and in general there is a lot of fan service but is done well and it's not annoying. The movie is also able to trigger people reactions and if you watch this movie in a passionate theatre the experience will be great because you can hear the sounds of the people around you, and it was something that I didn't experience since the pandemic has started and it was nice. You'll probably walk out from the viewing with very positive vibes and with high levels of satisfaction. BUT if you start think about it with a more critical view the magic will vanish because nothing makes sense. The premise is so stupid and the movie happens because Peter had suddenly become retarded, and not only him. Things happen because we will never know (like the reason for the return of the villains, the movie tries to give an explanation but in reality doesn't). And realistically what is the probability that between an infinite number of universes could happen exactly what has happened in the movie? How fortunate we were! And also the finale (that is very very satisfying and emotional) comes from a sudden change of the rules established previously in the movie. And so you can see that everything is only a pretext to please fans but without a real structure or a good premise behind it. The plot is useful only for the fan service. And if on one hand it is what has made my watching an experience, it is something that has to be noted. And so I am divided between my fan nature that has liked this movie and my rational and objective nature that dislikes it because of the nonsense of the plot. And so in conclusion what I can say is: go watch it for the experience without expecting a good movie, only a collection of cool scenes.", "90 mins in and already the best spiderman movie ever": "I won't spoil anything, but this story is very smart and balanced. It's funny, dramatic and full of spectacular action. But what makes this one the best spiderman movie for me, is the fact that all ingrediants are there. Great original story, lots of great action, solid acting from all involved, fast and funny. Simply a great ride! Coming from a guy that collected spiderman comics around in 1970.", "Some good bits but overall just average and nothing special": "I don't agree with the rating of this film. For me the first Spider-Man was the best and it's just gone down hill after that.The thing is this is nothing special. Nothing we have not seen before. For me it was mediocre. Maybe I'm just getting too old and I'm getting bored of Marvel films in general. Not the worse Spider-Man but not the best either.", "Spidey Heaven": "Marvel know how to make a good superhero movie. They don't launch into the action, but begin by building the emotional stakes. They get the audience invested. Then they kick things off and pile on the fun.It's been a while since I have seen a movie deliver so much pure joy. If I am to refrain from spoilers, I can only say that there are some very smart writers at Marvel.They did miss one trick though; at one point, one character says to another \"you are amazing\". The other character should have replied \"if I am amazing, then you are spectacular\".Fellow nerds will understand :-)", "Just about perfect": "Tom Holland's third featuring entry as the titular web-slinger is a masterpiece. The character development is poignant and heartfelt. The love for the source material is in every frame. All of the actors are brilliant and nobody phones in anything. This could so easily have felt like nostalgia bait but it's so much more than that. Willem Dafoe's performance alone is worth the price of admission. He is unbelievably good in this movie. Andrew Garfield is perfect. Tobey Maguire is perfect. Tom Holland has always been great and this is his best performance. Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx are perfect. Cimenatography stunning. Script is once in a lifetime. They do so much in this movie and they pull off all of it. Comedy beats are wonderful and often ingenious. Drama is heartwrenching and believable. Instantly relatable. We don't deserve a movie this good. This movie didn't have to be this good. But it is and I love it.Does it have any faults? The story doesn't make a lick of sense, but that's okay. The actors sell it.", "First film I've seen at the theater in over two years...": "I believe the last film I watched at the theater was that Lion King remake, but before that it was Spider-man Far From Home. I used to go to the movies all the time, but due to the whole pandemic thing I have not gone in a long while and add to that crippling depression making going out for me a very difficult task. That being said, I am a huge Spider-man fan and I have seen all the Spider-man films in the theater so I managed to get out of the house for my off day from work rather than just staying in bed all day. I was rewarded with a very good film, full of action and nostalgia; however, that being said due to my state of mind it also made me severely sad and a bit suicidal. Just hard for me these days to fully enjoy anything with me growing older and life becoming a pointless endeavor. Still, I enjoyed seeing the old villains, especially Dr. Octopus as he is my favorite Spider-man villain from the comics.The story, Mysterio's message at the end of Far From Home has Peter hounded by the press, taken in by agents and ruins his and his friends MJ and Ned's chances of getting into MIT. So Spider-man goes to Dr. Strange's place where he asks if there is anything the good sorcerer can do. Dr. Strange says he can make everyone forget Spidey's identity, but while in the middle of casting, Spider-man keeps adding stipulations causing the spell to go out of control. Soon enemies of Spider-man from the multiverse emerge and Spider-man must round them up so that they can be sent back; however, our hero soon learns that they are going to die and he wishes to help him despite Dr. Strange's protests. Soon Spider-man finds himself in the need of help as things get there darkest and he finds two other allies to help set things on the correct course.The film is good, but it definitely did not help my depression one bit. Watching the scene where MJ was rescued almost had me burst into tears, as I remembered the scene from one of the other films and remembered my fiance who has since passed away was with me during this time. I also felt alone as Peter was and feel a sense of hopelessness as my life has no meaning, so while a good movie, it probably can hurt someone who is struggling with bad depression as I am. I was honestly hoping for a more happy type film to make me feel a bit cheered up more than one that made me go further down...So a great film, one of the better MCU films and my favorite of Tom Holland's Spider-man films. I honestly, though, would love to see Garfield return to the role for maybe another Amazing film as it was good seeing him as Spider-man again and it would be nice to see some closure for his Spider-man. Heck, I would not mind another Tobey one either as that series never did have full closure either! That one is probably less likely due to Tobey's age though. I will say my only real complaint of the film is the lack of a new villain, this being due to the fact Spider-man has a whole gallery of villains so having a new one would have been easy and would have given the film six Spidey foes making them sort of a Sinister Six! That would have been cool, but still an amazing film all the same.", "Spider-Man No Way Home": "This is easily Hollands best performance. MJ and Hollands relationship builds throughout and you get to know them more. Ned is yet again funny as he always is. Bringing back Tobey and Andrew was a great move they both had good performances in this movie and the Villains they brought back too made this movie one of the best Spider-Mans ever.", "Bless your cotton socks Mr Feige": "People kept whooping. They kept on cheering at every little thing. We get it, you remember things from old movies. Now please be quiet so that we can actually hear the dialogue. Yes, everyone here is a Marvel fan; the characters on the screen can't hear you. Chances are no one involved in the filmmaking process is here in this screening so there is no need to clap and applause.A hefty amount of nostalgia bait, some crippling plot holes and inexplicable character choices make up what is the best Spider-Man 3.Should have brought back the Aunt May from the Rami trilogy. We needed another monologue about heroism.", "An exciting adventure weighed down by misleading marketing": "Spider-Man is fantastic for 2 hours out of it 2.5 hour run-time. The finale certainly dwindles but that isn't the biggest fault. The problem for me was with it's over-abundant fan service and the disingenous marketing surrounding the movie.I don't usually mark spoilers but it feels necessary here. It felt like this was supposed to be the film that got the multiverse started beyond the Loki series, and it truly doesn't. It is an entirely self-contained story. Even the venom tease from venom 2 post credits does not come to fruition, and instead, just passes through to another post credits scene to further tease.The film did have mostly positives across the board which kept it at an 8 for me. In particular, I think this is the best sound design in a Marvel film to date. The punches, terrain shattering, and dialgoue were so crisp and distinct. The sound scape just felt right in every scene and I would love Christopher Nolan to take some notes prior to directing his next thriller.", "The Best Spider-Man mMovie Ever": "I dare say this movie is a bit better than Avengers: Endgame. Why? Because there are some unexpected expected suprise here and there. It's great in every angle: action, comedy and emotions. This is all I can say because I do not want to spoil it. Don't forget to sit after the very end of the end credits.", "20 Years and Worth the Wait": "I could not believe how good this was. I was expecting no end of fan service but this how you do it right. This film seemed to be made with love for the character and the audiences who love him.And him. And him too.SPOILERS:Tobey Maguire was my first Spiderman as a kid and Spiderman 2 holds up to this day. Seeing Alfred Molina and Tobey share a scene together was absolutely touching. Andrew Garfield's performance was chock full of nuance and gave his Spiderman a proper send off. As lame as his films were, his Spiderman was a lot of fun and deserved better.", "Movie for the fans": "This is 100% a fan movie. Has everything you could have wished for. I honestly don't have words to describe this film. I'm getting Iron Man 1 vibes and more! Just go see it. Do it!!!", "Most Insane Spider-Man Movie": "Hands down the best spider-man film ever. I truly believe that this movie was the most anticipated film and it lived up to its hype. Still shocked at how it was pulled off. But it was done and now I hope there's a future for our spider-man and maybe any of the other characters that showed up in this amazing film. Best film since Endgame!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Superbly recycle two decades of Spidey to connect them all and close this chapter to start fresh new stories from now on.": "Spiderman Far From Home is to years of stand alone Spider-Man movies what Avenger Endgame was to Avengers: an amazing grand finale to wrap up all the previous adventures in a grand manner, thus allowing a new phase.This allows something very special:\nTobey, Andrew & Tom are no longer three different set of movies, they all come to as one adventure, together.Spidey is now reset to a new beginning (no caretaker, no girlfriend, no best friend). This will allow the building of a whole new story.Because Spidey Tom still remembers it all, this closed chapter can't be dismissed or forgotten, it is the building block of what's to come. It's a bittersweet legacy which opens door to bringing back the past if writers want to go that way at a later stage (after all, a spell can be reversed, most times!).I always loved these three actors, seeing them together was a dream come true I could never have dreamt of in the past. And before you know it, it's already the end of the movie, this is how captivating it is. 10/10 for me for sure!", "it had nothing": "The story was boring, acting unimpressive, peter parker character is exceptionally unremarkable.

It got me hooked from the begining to the end .theres no boring moment, every minute was just hookd on watching. The ending of the movie was something I didn't expect ...the ending itself was like a new begging . It starts all over again, friendship, love , a new school and city !!!Spiderman this round was just epic!", "Everything you want it to be and more": "Remember when critics said there were too many villains in the third installment of the Raimi trilogy? Well Marvel somehow managed to have twice as many villains and they all got an arc, not to mention some other amazing cameos... Oh it was just soooooo good. I can't wait to see it again ASAP.", "for the fans": "Greate movie, def is for the fans that grew up with spiderman's movies and waited years for this. To me is an 8 bc is fun, has some nostalgic value, and is nice to see old faces and how those characters grew, that said it wasn't that much, but still.The action scenes could have being better, there are a lot of characters and it felt underwealming, the sand dude has no reason to fight against the spidermen, Doc Oc is a cool character, why not make him fight? Whats with all of them knowing they where going to die, dd they revive? Why not at the end make people forget about Spiderman and not Peter??Don't think is very rewatchable, but had a great time. (even tho I knew the other Spidermen where going to appear, why no one talked about the bad guys or Murdok, that was a surprise to me and I watched like a year and a half of its release)", "Whatever happened to originality?": "As good as CGI is you still have to have an original story, this nonsense doesn't.I admit that I am not a fan of middle aged men pretending to be hero's in Lyra suits, in fact the whole superhero concept is alien to me but I can remember when movies used to be original, have a story, engaging acting and some sort of reality but this has nothing.", "Amazing! But watch the order Spiderman movies first!": "Absolutely incredible! They did an amazing job wrapping everything together. Definitely watch the older Spider-Man movies first though, and you will get far more out of this one. And of course watch all the other Marvel movies first too. Lol.", "Overrated": "This movie is annoying and tasteless. It is the same thing that is done in every marvel movie, just with fan service. I really don't know why it is rated so high.", "OK but not the best": "I liked homecoming a lot better but this movie is still really good fun good for the whole family I enjoyed it not the best of the series but again this is just my opinion.", "Actually as good as they say": "This first part's not about the movie itself but the experience I had which I'll now always associate with the movie now. Okay so I bought 4DX tickets and it was my first time, it's crazy man. The seat started moving around like a roller coaster, wind was blowing, when the scene was somewhere cold in the movie the cinema got cold all of a sudden, water was being sprinkled everywhere, chair was vibrating and moving all over my back. The wind and water was coming from different directions, hit me behind my ears, in my face from the from the seat infront, from the sides, under and behind my ankles. I expected it, but was still really stunned. And I got a large Pepsi which I finished in about 20min and didn't pee before the movie, which is 3hr long if you consider the cinema ads in the beginning, so halfway through I had to pee really bad and the seat was throwing me around, my bladder hurt so bad\ud83d\ude02 didn't want to miss a thing so I had to wait for the movie to end and people were staring at me all weird 'cause I was the only one leaving since we all wait for the post credit scenes\ud83d\ude02 there are two of them.But my outtake from the movie, what stood out the most to me is Tom Halland is really good at playing sad scenes, every time I see him sad or crying I feel like I wanna cry too, the African in me doesn't allow it but I do. That Andrew Garfield scene also made me wanna cry. Spider-Man's not one of my favorite heroes but I think this is one of the best movies marvel has made so far, and I love how each of the Spider-Mans all brought back the same feeling their individual movies had back then, it was great to see. Not really a complaint but I wasn't really convinced Dr. Strange was that oblivious to the consequences of what he and Spider-Man were doing, he accepted doing the favour way too easily and didn't seem surprised when everything went haywire; and can't really blame it on the acting because Cumberbatch is astounding so I'll assume it's a \"giving thanos the time stone\" kinda situation. Unlike some MCU movies, this one didn't make the fan theories seem bonkers.The movie's quite long and takes you through different emotions, I got happy, then sad, then surprised then sad again and I think good movies should do that. Recent trend in superhero movies is to make them more comedic and I love it but thought was getting a bit too far because I think movies like Let There Be Carnage should have been much darker and gory, with a higher rating like R 18 even with the funny bits, not to say the same about Spider-Man, but i think they got the comedy-drama-action blend perfectly here. I was honestly surprised it's maintaining a 9/10 rating even after being released a couple days but it is as good as they say.", "very decent installment!": "Personally for me , it is far from best Spiderman film ever) It feels so overwhelmingly too much , with all the previous villains and previous Spidermen , that for me all film somehow lost focus...\nnevertheless , definitely worth to watch !", "Favourite film ever": "I cannot explain my love for this film!! My favourite film ever! The fan service with you know who being in it (3 big surprises). The atmosphere in the cinema was amazing and made it so much better clapping cheering. There was great action, good laughs and throwbacks and emotional moments. Basically everything a film should have!! PERFECT.", "Mostly for teenagers": "If you are no teenager no more, stay away from this. In order to diversify there is far too much focus on friends and girlfriend and the stupid dialogue that follows such a focus, because for some reason everyone needs to be totally cool all the time.", "\"You wouldn't happen to be from another universe, would you?\"": "I believe this film entered IMDb's 'Top 250' at number #9, briefly rose to #8, and has now settled down into the 17th spot as I write this, right between \"The Matrix\" and \"Goodfellas\". I go on this little rant every time a new comic book super-hero movie comes out, because in anyone's wildest imagination, this cannot possibly be the 17th best movie of all time. Not that it will stay there as time goes by, but it just boggles my mind how a movie's audience and IMDb voters can impact a film's standing when it first comes out. Anyway, enough of that.For me, I thought the picture was quite a fun and entertaining experience. The idea of the two former Spider-Man actors returning to the big screen to help out Tom Holland's current depiction of the character was just a marvelous touch. Combined with many of the past Spidey villains and that quick cameo by Charlie Cox as Attorney Matt Murdoch made this an exciting and unexpected pleasure. Anywhere else the whole multiverse concept could have been a huge bungle, but the screenwriters here did a competent job of melding the disparate universes into a cohesive story that didn't seem far fetched within the context of Spider-Man's comic book history.With over four thousand reviews already posted here for this movie, there's not a whole lot I'm able to add to the discussion. Just know that if you go see this movie, it will quite likely exceed your expectations via creative story telling and superb visual effects. In other words, it's what you go to the theater for.", "I don't usually rate a movie 10/10 but this movie ...": "The movie that we were waiting for a long time is finally here and This movie was great , amzaing and one of a kind . I really liked this movie , Spiderman no way home won't let you out disappointed , It made me sad , happy , shocked , nostalgic , laughing and tearing . I didn't t believe that this movie was real and it felt like a dream . I didn't like the visual effects in some of the scenes but it doesn't matter with this greaaat movie , It's not enough to watch it once , I really recommend you to watch this great movie and the best spiderman movie and one of the best movies i've seen . If you love Spiderman you'll love this movie and it'll be one of the best spiderman movies .", "Worst Spider-Man Movie": "I do understand that we are watching a Sci-fi movie, totally fantastic one. But, at least it has to have a clear plot, storyline and logical entertainment. The movie is like bringing you here and there without any particular reason. Simply, the movie starts with some kids including Peter want to admit to the university, but they are unsuccessful, because everyone knows Peters identity. Peter goes to Dr. Strange and asks him everyone forget who he was, so he lives a peaceful life. Dr. Strange messed up and brought all these creatures to earth, so they caught all of them and wanted to send them back home. Meanwhile, now Peter is against Dr. Strange because some of them might die, because fate is fate. Peter released them, so I stopped watching this nonsense movie just there. I don't really care if entire world got crazy and think that it's the best movie, for me it's just empty and nonsense movie ever.", "Excellent Spider-Man Story": "Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tom Holland) has his identify revealed to the whole world. He asks Dr Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help so the whole world would not remember that Peter Parker is Spider-Man, but the spell goes wrong and Demons appear. We will see other Peter Parkers (Spider-Men) from different dimensions appear: Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield. This should be interesting.Normally, I would not watch a Spider-Man movie, but when I was told that the other Spider-men would appear I was curious. I am glad I watched because at the end for the final showdown, all 3-Spider-Men get together to put the Demons in one place so they can be healed (and not killed) and sent back to their own dimensions by the Wizard, Dr Strange. The scenes with all 3-Spider-Men were pure gold. Kudos. This was a very big plus for this story.Also, for any Spider-Man movie it's really all about the CGI and in here it was the most impressive I have even seen. I had to ask myself just how they did all that including spectacular Cinematography as everything looked too real. It's true CGI makes movies better.The story, the acting performances and dialogues were all perfect. Also, there are touches of pure and honest humanity as well. Very real heartbreaking and touching scenes with Aunt May (Maris Tomei) and Peter Parker. Have that box of Kleenex nearby. You will need it.Notables: Marisa Tomei as May Parker; Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan; Jamie Foxx as Max Dillon/Electro; Willem Dafoe as Noman Osborn/The Green Goblin; Alfred Molina as Dr Otto Octavius; Zendaya as MJ, Peter Parker's girlfriend; Tom Hardy as Venom; J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, reporter who blames Peter Parker as Spiderman for everything that has gone wrong; Jacob Batalon as Ned, Peter Parker's best friend; Benedict Wong as Wong, who warns that a spell by Dr. Strange would only bring bad consequences; Rhys Ifans as Dr Connors/The Lizard; Thomas Hayden Church as Flint Marko/The Sandman.Usually, we would see Stan Lee somewhere in Spider-Man stories, but Mr. Stan Lee had recently passed. However, his influence is always there as a writer of Spider-Man stories. KudosThis is an excellent Spider-Man story, maybe the best one. A pure touch of class was having all three Spider-Men interact together and that caused me to watch this story. I was impressed.

They destroyed every character, Molina deserved it, he admitted he did it for money, i don't know how much they payed the others to let them humiliate their characters like that. Willem Dafoe deserved all the praises for holding the ground and keeping his integrity and regret that we don't have a joker movie with him. I hope everybody sees this movie and compare the views, see the cliches and the unoriginal ideas. Waiting for Morbius, hope that one isn't destroyed too.", "Hollywood egos run amok": "The writers nowadays seem drunk on their power to bend the universe and bring favourite characters back to life. Trouble is, they seem to have a problem even with their own internal logic (eg: that 50% of the population absurdity, when planes were dropping out of the sky and smashing into buildings and driverless vehicles were causing chaos and mayhem among the other 50%; so the snapped 50% clearly took a lot of 'collateral' lives with them) and so the plots go haywire.This plot was clearly aimed at high-school children, but they will see through all the gaping holes once they get over the entertainment and special effects. It was entertaining and there were a few excellent moments (look out for blind lawyer trick). And the acting was full of enthusiasm. But they all deserve much better writers!Tom Holland was excellent in \"Uncharted\", but here he mostly comes across as a very limited kid who always acts impulsively instead of thinking things through.", "During a pandemic, winter surge, new variant, mandates, and lockdowns.": "The theaters are packed, because it's the first good movie made this year. Critics can't hide behind \"pandemic\" excuses to explain away bad movies that focus on diversity, and sending messages over good story telling anymore. This was non-stop fan fare the whole time! TAKE NOTE CRITICS AND DISNEY! THANK YOU SONY!", "I Don't Want To Get Off Mr. Bones' Wild Ride.": "Near perfect event film, never seen a theatre cheer louder multiple times. The best non-avengers MCU film by far and probably only second overall to Infinity War. Oddly hilarious but quite emotional. They may only be theme park rides but I don't want to get off Mr. Bones' Wild Ride.", "Strongest of the MCU Spidey Trilogy": "I'll be honest, I was going this expecting the hype around the film to exceed its quality but it was delightfully surprising.Despite knowing the biggest and most exciting twist of the film (thanks internet), the film managed to surprise and deliver.With the absolute stand out performance of Tom Holland as Spider-Man and the surprise appearance of a few familiar faces, the film delivers in an action packed yet still emotionally powerful way quickly and easily becoming the best of the MCU's Spider-Man movies.The only real criticism I have of this film is it's reliance on past characters and films to carry the narrative of the film. Rather than coming up with new ideas for Spider-Man and the future of his character in the MCU, they chose to rehash old favourites. Whilst I understand that to a certain extent, it is a little disappointing to see so much of the film hinge on it.", "Beautiful movie! Might be even better than endgame!!": "This movie was absolutely stunning and emotional and incredible and many other things that I cannot express now. Getting out of the theater I was a little trembled. I have never seen a superhero movie like this before! Tom Holland is amazing and real and fantastic and he delivers his Spider-Man character with everything he's got! The movie overall was a perfect way to close off this trilogy and send Tom Hollands Spider-Man on a new adventure! I cannot wait to see what is next for my favorite actor in the MCU! Even though I did not see the other Spider-Man movies (non-MCU) to prepare for this, it felt very emotional to see all three Spider-Man together! Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield and the rest of the other actors from the other films were amazing and their little screen time gave them perfect character development! This film touched me in a way that I cannot describe! I love Spider-Man No Way Home and I love how the MCU is heading in the right direction! I cannot wait for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of madness!!!!! WATCH THIS FILM EVERYONE! Trust me, you will not be disappointed ONE BIT!!!!!!!!!!!", "Martin Scorsese was right!!": "I miss film with stories and not being lazy and now marvel has been brining back old characters just for the audience reaction, cinema wise best experience ever, I watched it at home \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 it was soo boring no story no nothing and mcu film ruined films industry like Martin Scorsese have said, cause if we watch a film these day people would get board and say \"no action\" or \"no comedy\" and it's just sad to see.

I walked out of the theater astounded. Tom's performance in this movie was one of his best throughout his time with Marvel. Don't even get me started on Willems performance as green goblin was 2x better than when he first played him. My emotions were on a rollercoaster throughout the entire film. I watched it opening day, I'm going again today, and I'll be seeing it at least two more times next week.", "Thee spider men in the multiverse - pretty cool!": "I watched the movie in a flight, and I'm happy I did that.Here are a few things I didn't like.It was so obvious / awkward to get Garfield saving MJ (Poor Gwen)Why...why did Peter set all the villians free...(Poor Doctor Strange) And why was the aunt so blindly supportive of doing thatNot to mention the whole mess was just because Peter being annoying during a magic curse \ud83d\ude02", "Best since Spiderman 2": "All i can say is i was really skeptical about this film because i'm not a fan of characters coming back from the dead but they really got it right in this in my opinion.

You can watch it many times. I myself going to watch this movie again. It has everything that should be in a movie.

Besides that, what's left of this is:\nIncoherent plot. Awful script. Mediocre action and fights. Again, A banquet of Nostalgia and references to the old movies. Mediocre performances except from Dafoe and Tom. Too long, too many excuses , too many plot-holes and conveniences for the sake of extending the movie.

Trying to be both inventive, and still relying on good characters vs bad characters, and if one changes, it does from good to bad or vice-versa, but having no human emotion. So this feels like scripted by an AI of Apple, studying 5-year olds.All this being said, one will watch it nonetheless, because it is over rated, to the point it made it to top 250. But on the way our it will end it in the Marvel pile of movies, where it rates as about as average, maybe an inch above.So for me these movies rank as 4/10, with these new copycat at 5/10. In my view, don't bother, but one cannot be really stopped in wasting 2.5hrs of their life that easy!", "An excellent action-packed dramatic film that made me fall in love with Peter and MJ as a couple": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is a thrilling gut-punching ride. It's highly entertaining but also very emotionally impactful and will leave an impact on you long after you've left the theater.The drama is incredibly compelling and gripping and you'll be on the edge of your seat all throughout the film. There are constant stakes and tension; not a moment feels \"safe\". You feel Peter's vulnerability and the sheer chaos of his situation. The \"Spidey-Sense\" scene is a prime example. The action sequences are also very tense as well as exciting and well-choreographed. I gotta give praise to the fight with Doc Ock, as it's really entertaining and one of the film's highlights while also not making the same mistake as Spider-Man 2 (as great as that movie is) in which Spider-Man hits Doc Ock with so many devastating blows it's not even believable that he, a normal guy who just has mechanical tentacles, can survive or not be horribly wounded. In this film it's mostly the tentacles that Peter hits, Ock never gets directly hit in the face or launched into a car. The battles between Peter and the Green Goblin are also very brutal, physical, and personal.There's a lot of great character development for Peter, MJ, Aunt May, Otto Octavius, Norman Osborn, and Electro. Peter selflessness is really emphasized here and Tom Holland delivers a fantastic performance as always. Peter and MJ's relationship is especially impactful in this movie; you can tell how much they care about each other and their chemistry is perfect. MJ is there for and supports Peter making for some of the most adorable and warming scenes in the film. They feel compatible and it has become my favorite film Spider-Man relationship. The friendship between Peter, MJ, and Ned is so genuine and heartwarming. Norman Osborn's turmoil is acted brilliantly by Willem Dafoe; he's so sympathetic as Norman and so deliciously, frighteningly evil as the Goblin. Doc Ock was taken straight out of Spider-Man 2 (and that's a good thing, of course). Seeing Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield return was also a treat and there are a ton of great character-defining and poetic moments with them, especially with Andrew. At the same time it pays respects to all of these characters it also isn't afraid to have some comic relief and poke fun at the character's quirks. It's self-aware while also paying tribute to all of them, pointing out things that are strange in a way that doesn't feel like they're trashing on them. JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson is also perfect; he's infuriating in a good way and his constant accusations towards Spider-Man ramp up the tension. Oh and it's really great that the Lizard and Electro got a redesign, since their original designs weren't all that good.The themes about responsibility, loss, growing up and relationships are very strong, and like the last two MCU Spider-Man outings, they are very well-integrated into the plot. The death of Aunt May and ending are heartbreaking, especially with how much Peter and MJ love each other, yet also so Spider-Man. You WANT him to tell her the truth so bad, but him not doing so is so in-character for Peter. You WANT her to remember him so bad, but... she doesn't. The ending swing is triumphant yet somber, heroic yet heartbreaking, gorgeous yet lonely. It leaves such a strong impact. It's so great to see classic Spider-Man... and yet, you feel so bad for Peter. The soundtrack will give you goosebumps, especially during the most emotional scenes.This film is one of the best of the MCU, and I can't wait for what they have in store for Tom Holland's Spider-Man in the future. We're getting 6 more movies, and I have no doubt that they will be excellent. And please please please get Peter back with MJ if they just throw away MJ and Ned and their relationships with Peter I will riot out of heartbreak.", "Don't care about the flaws it's a blast": "Amazing Spider-Man film in my opinion still not as good as into the spider verse but still phenomenal. It's an exciting well acted superhero flick with a great 3rd act and post credit.", "Eh": "I hate Marvel movie and in this case I could've just lie and say I hate this movie too but no, I'm actually a little impressed of what they've done here. I love how this movie took a more playful route, the comedy is alive and although I dont think they're funny they're consistent and its giving the impression that the movie doesnt take itself very seriously. I like that better compared to their previous serious approach. Problems like plotholes and things that are just came to be are still here but it's somewhat justified because the whole plot makes no sense in the first place and so these plotholes are just a shortcut to get the characters to interact with each other and I'm honestly fine with that, its a movie where a grown man pretending to have superpowers anyway. Much of the films are nostalgia bait and much of them are effectively done. Instead of just referencing them they actually put some effort into creating something new but similar and incorporate bits from the past. Although some didn't turn well and come of as cringe like when aunt May died and she said great responsibility power thingy stuff, that was just cringe. Still the story here is the same old brain dead virtuous tripe and some actors are badly miscast, like Jamie Foxx. And there's no reason for this movie to be over 2 hours long. Anyway its a major improvement to the previous two Jon Watts' Spider-man. And I really wish they took more of this playful route and just embrace the goofiness of the superhero genre instead of trying to be all preachy and inspiring.", "Incredibly ambitious and remarkably executed": "I cannot fathom the work that went into pulling this movie off, from all sides. It left me feeling incredibly bereft and totally lost for words - if it wasn't for encouraging news regarding the future of Tom Holland's Spider-Man in the MCU I think this movie would have broken me. But I cannot stress enough how impressed by it I am - I rarely leave reviews, only when I feel compelled to do so, and this movie has that impact. The sheer reaction in the cinema gave it an Endgame level feeling, not surprising as this film is essentially Spider-Man's Endgame. Be prepared to laugh, whoop and cry in equal measure, but see this film in a cinema packed with as many spectators as you can. It's an unforgettable experience, and I can't wait to watch it again.", "Did not even bring back nostalgia": "Tobey andrew huh\nNothing they came and went away i did not feel anything cringe comedy stupid dialogs and dumb endgame type ending but even more lighter.", "contrary to popular belief": "My review is contrary to popular belief. There were high expectations for this movie, and after careful thought, I am not satisfied with how it turned out.As trailers were being released, I only watched the first one because I did not want to risk seeing too much considering the Sinister Six was hinted at (except for the mystery sixth member). But that was pivoted to essentially every villain for himself situation for majority of the movie and made for a loose story.The story did not hit home for me. Spider-Man was essentially trying to save the villains from themselves by curing them. The cure essentially would take all their powers away and all that would be left is just a human. To me, this made Spider-Man the antagonist.There was one part of the movie that I truly enjoyed and that was when Doc Ock first appeared on the bridge (also shown in the trailer). That entire sequence was edge of your seat worthy. But then as the movie progressed, it became too predictable which took away from the edge of your seat feel.One thing that really bothers me about the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies is his web swinging in New York. We have yet to really see that happen despite this is his sixth appearance on the big screen. That is one of the most exciting parts of Spider-Man is seeing his web swinging throughout New York City, and the audience finally got it but only for approximately 15 seconds.Sony and Marvel should have done a better job with producing a story which showed the Sinister Six instead of their tactic of bait and switch.", "The best Spiderman ever": "The best Spiderman ever. I frankly don't like the start. Too fast, too confusing but then it gets better and better. And when the other 2 Spiderman join....it gets really awesome.", "a 90-minute movie stretched o boring, 160-minute pain": "More than an hour of movie time wasted on overly-emotional, tiresome emotional claptrap. Oh, we're such good friends! Oh, we love each other so much! Oh, I'm such a reformed bad guy. Give me a break. After 90 minutes, I was retching with impatience, disgust and boredom.", "Simply Put: A Ton Of Fun!": "This movie finds itself in the midst of a tornado of familiar faces and weaves them all together as close to seamlessly as one could hope for. Marvel's usual irreverent humor is on stellar display here, in addition to their penchant for punching you right in the nostalgia as well as hitting you right in the feels. The visuals are predictably spot on and the whole experience left me wanting to revisit some beloved classics. Granted, if you haven't kept up with the MCU, you'll find yourself a bit confused at times, but I'd wager to say it's a damn good time, regardless of your experience.", "Pure Fan service, but is it good?": "It delivers a punch of fan aglore down our throats you can't help but be giddy and excited about it.But what is up with this rating? 8.8?The movie hold ups.And a lot of it's cameos have legitimate roles and add to the emotion and story in a surmountable way.But are we really falling for this? Is this all that constitutes cinema? Fan-bait media.I'm sorry, but this is no higher than a 7. I'm just bringing the rating down to it's rightful rating.There is good energy and life spirited throguhout, but this is fan service. Not bad fan-service. But is that what makes great cinema now?", "SOOOO SO GOOD!!!!": "If you have been watching the spider man movies since 2002 you will love it. It literally keeps you on the edge of your seat. Best most epic scene was when all three spider mans come together. When Toby popped out everyone in the theater literally screamed in excitement! It was absolutely worth the $11 ticket. Hell I'd pay $20. Also, Zendaya was fantastic in her role as was Tom. They have great chemistry. Jamie fox was hilarious too! The saddest part eas aunt mae dying. Definitely bring some tissues.", "What has become of this fanbase?": "What has happened to standards of quality?!And Spider-Man being your friendly neighborhood everyman?!The whole point of this character is meant to connect to people with everyday problems facing them with a lack of control over it because he's trying to balance out those everyday problems as he grows as a person into a matured man. While keeping the super heroics on the most personal grounded level as possible.At some point seemingly everyone has abandon this idea.Now he's just every other generic superhero that just there to beat the villain with stupidly high stakes with no grounded relatable problems and a incredibly forced team up added to it. While getting all the gadgets, perks and help from any superhero he meets without any hard effort for it.Cause that's what Spider-Man is all about that's all everyday problems we ourselves have dealt with.This fanbase now are just jam-packed with A grade hypocrites.Claiming to have high standards and expectation for this character being relatable and unique from other superheroes yet will drop it as soon as some other cool superhero shows up or teams up with him.All of a sudden the superheroes are the only things that matters, not the people themself.For a fanbase of a character who's all about responsibility the fans sure don't care much about acting responsible or consistent for what standards they say they have or for what they say or do themselves.And now cause of that actual irresponsible behavior this character life is one none of us can connect to anything in our own life's anymore.And I'm done with all of this garbage!Especially with this insane fanbase with zero standards not caring whatsoever what this character meant to represent anymore!4/10 Mediocre movie just as expected.", "Complex and well handled": "So great. I loved every aspect, and they handled some hard topics with grace and still managed to keep the action. I wanted to cry and laugh and was totally captivated the whole time.", "Expanding universe, shrinking story": "The thing about multiverse stories is they are great for callbacks and humor...but not great for coherent plotlines or character arcs. (That's part of why the multiverse functioned best in Spider-verse: animated films can get away with being less tethered to reality.) Anyway, I loved seeing old characters return or the amusing banter, but this was my least favorite of the MCU Spider-man movies. The earlier tales, especially the first, worked because they felt like simpler teen movies and the main characters - Peter, Ned, MJ - had fantastic chemistry. Those moments were too few and far between here because we had so much multiverse to traverse and so much plot to explain. The twists were convoluted, the plot holes were large, and the whole thing worked better when it revolved around academic bowl and prom. Basically, my favorite MCU remains simpler MCU. Involving more villains (and heroes) than ever before was definitely not \"simple.\" They're expanding their universe, but shrinking the story. Is it fun? Yes. Could it be better? Absolutely.", "2.5hrs of an epic classic in superhero fans' eyes is a bit much for those with more mature tastes": "Why do only the superhero movies get all of Hollywood's best (casts, effects, polish, etc) with \"Spideman: No Way Home\" a prime example? Likeable Tom Holland leads too many top names to list (but inc Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Willem Defoe, Jamie Foxx, JK Simmons, Alfred Molino, Marisa Tomei, Jacob Batalon & so many more) in a spectacular adventure (directed with flair by Jon Watts) in which characters from previous spidie flicks (inc old leads Andrew Garfield & Tobey Maguire) return to wage explosive moral battle against each other. For superhero fans it's an epic... but for more mature tastes 2.5 hrs of this is an excessive waste.", "Could this be the greatest comic book film of all time?": "Firstly, I'm a big spidey fan. I've loved all the actors who played them but I do consider Tom Holland the best out of the three.I don't want to post any spoilers how ever obvious they might seem to some, because I know people who still know nothing about this film but I have to say, WHAT A FILM!!I didn't want it to end! Probably the best film to come out of the MCU. Up there with Infinity War...I think it could be better.I can't think of anything bad about this film but there was one part I wasn't sure on...a certain line...but it didn't devalue it for me in any way. It was just different and I didn't expect it to come where it came from.And that bridge fight is even better than the train fight.A MUST WATCH for all Spider-Man fans.", "Clever fan service": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is clever fan service. The usual MCU self-references are present, but No Way Home takes a step further, acknowledging previous Spider-Man eras as its central story. Turning references into legitimate plot points deserves credit. Furthermore, the cast is truly stunning and the main selling point here. The film successfully brings all these eras together and gives everyone time to shine. Naturally, this all helps the acting too because the excellent cast clearly enjoys their roles. Add in the patented MCU filmmaking baseline, and the result is a surefire hit.However, No Way Home's gimmicks do not make a masterpiece. On a technical level, the film is still basic MCU. Occasionally, there is abstract sound and visual craft, but those aspects are mostly standard. The same goes for the editing, music, and production, which all meet (but rarely elevate) the material. Lastly, the writing and direction both get lost in the massive shuffle. This is the most epic MCU Spider-Man, and, unfortunately, the least heartfelt. The tone isn't focused and the emotional beats aren't earned. The attempts are decent, but don't resonate amongst the excitement. Nevertheless, No Way Home is certainly everything the fanboys want.Writing: 6/10\nDirection: 6/10\nCinematography: 7/10\nActing: 8/10\nEditing: 7/10\nSound: 8/10\nScore/Soundtrack: 7/10\nProduction Design: 8/10\nCasting: 10/10\nEffects: 8/10Overall Score: 7.5/10.", "Time Heals All Wounds...": "We walked into Emagine Theater in Royal Oak and there were couples and teenagers all over the place. When we entered our Theater in the Multiplex the place was already packed and somebody was already in our seats, so we took the empty seats in the middle on the second deck. The packed house reminded me of when I walked down the aisle next to the wall in the dark for the showing of GREYSTOKE: THE LEGEND OF TARZAN, LORD OF THE APES (1984). The audience was primed to make this movie a communal event. Just as I was taken aback by the mythic power of Tarzan back in the day at that Harper Woods movie theater, I was not completely prepared for how well received Spiderman would be this time out at Emagine.This movie is a Spiderman for a new generation. After the catharsis of AVENGERS: ENDGAME (2019), I was ready to move on as the limitations of the genre were becoming more and more apparent to someone like me approaching and achieving an advanced age. But the buzz about this movie was powerful and growing to be overwhelming, and besides, my nephew wanted to see it and could more easily relate to the trials of Peter Parker. Suffice it to say that this version of the adventures of Spiderman did not disappoint. When we walked back out into the lobby there were teenagers lounging around everywhere seated on the carpeted steps and strolling about as though school had just let out for spring break or summer vacation. Somehow watching Spiderman gave them the space to be themselves and it was intriguing and faintly exhilarating to behold.I understood what they were feeling and respected it. I still remembered vividly how I felt after reading THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN #4, and his knock down drag out battle with the Sandman. I sensed these young people were feeling much the same way now that I felt way back then, and I was more than content to let them have their moment. These movies were the emotional equivalent of what I experienced in the original comic books. I was gratified to realize that I could appreciate the breath of their experience with a greater sense of depth and perspective now that my teenage years were long past. This was their very special event that I could never completely understand, just as I might consider that they could never completely understand what it was like to be there at the beginning, flipping through the pages of the very first Marvel Comics.The movie was very entertaining and I felt immediately at home in Steve Ditko's version of the multiverse now transplanted to the screen by director Jon Watts with the blessings of Stan Lee. I recognized right off that the plot was a reworking of Spiderman's epic battle with THE SINISTER SIX in his very first 72 BIG PAGES ANNUAL comic book. Kraven the Hunter was nowhere in sight and Mysterio was long gone from the last sequel, but the rest of the gang was all there with the Green Goblin bringing up the rear. So Spiderman still found his hands full fighting head up with the likes of Electro, The Vulture, Doctor Octopus, and The Sandman pouring out of fissures and disturbances in the multiverse caused by Peter Parker fudging Doctor Strange's spell to help him turn back the hands of time to that point when he possessed a secret identity. If you can get ahold of that annual from 1964, you might find it amusing to compare the subplots from the annual with the movie. Each has its own particular merits.There's no time for Spiderman to enlist the aid of The Fantastic Four, Captain America, or even The Avengers, so who should show up from their alternate universes to give your friendly neighborhood Spiderman a lil' help? Hopping in hardly missing a beat, here comes Tobey McQuire and Andy Garfield each in his turn to the rousing applause of the audience! Together with Tom Holland these crime fighters make a tremendous trio, but there is still a lot of exploding Time and Space to be handled in the multiverse and Super Villains to confront gnashing their teeth and strutting their stuff. Doctor Strange does his best to referee the action with an apocalyptic spell here and there, and the Spidermen in triplicate do their best to send the villains packing back to where they belong while struggling with their own self doubts that it even can be done. But somehow, everybody ends up tumbling their way in a return to their home universe or close to it, no harm and a lot of foul on the prowl, while Spiderman once again finds himself swinging around and over skyscrapers like some kind of urban Tarzan with Zendaya as Mary Jane holding on for dear life with terrified, giddy glee.All of it is a fun ride through every dimension but loose, and here and there it tugs at the heart strings and makes wacky sense in a very wry, offhand way that is the signature of the Marvel Universe. Where The Amazing Spiderman goes next is anybody's guess, but one thing's for sure, nobody is leaving the party now!", "Better Than The Previous 2 Films, But Still Not A Patch On The Originals!": "So, I've come back from a screening of this tonight & have to say I'm surprised! I didn't think I'd hate or dislike it as much, but at the same time, I wasn't wowed either despite the returns of the original characters from the other & Universes!The film picks up exactly from where the last Spider-Man Film left off! Peter Parker is accused of murder & must try to clear his name while simultaneously go to college with his best mate & girlfriend, which they all fail to do, so with the help of Doctor Strange he tries to brainwash the world so they can all go to the same college together! But something in the spell goes wrong & causes the other universes (other franchises to us) to come into their world, this means the original Villains & other Peters & they must fight off these villains & put them back where they came from, but this Peter has other ideas...!I found the film to be overall interesting, I mean it still suffers from the same issues the first 2 films of Tom Hollands Spider-Man does, you know, characters aren't how they're portrayed in the originals, dumb goofiness, other characters being added in, muddied story-line & sub plots/characters & overly long runtime with dragged comedic scenes which take away from the seriousness!But aside from that, surprised, this film introduces the old characters & what's more, they're the original actors from Tobey McGuire's Spider-Man & the rebooted Andrew Garfield Spider-Man! While weird it somehow worked just about & the story wasn't too bad either!However, the film is 2hrs & 15mins too long! It drags there's scenes which are too dumb to be in the film which take away from the seriousness! While I liked the return of the original Spider-Mans it felt dumb & weird to some extend & that it wasn't its own film, like with the previous 2 films...!Overall, it's a good film to an extent, but it's not amazing! 6/10!", "Great one!!": "This movie really has ignited my love for the franchise once again, and I am truly excited for what comes next.Nostalgia, there seems to be a real thirst for it these days, and there is a lot of it to enjoy here. There are plenty of moments throughout that will have you speechless, they really do break all of the rules here.This is one incredibly good looking movie, dazzling special effects, dizzying action scenes.Overall, \"No Way Home\" didn't felt like a 2 h 20 min movie because it is superbly entertaining. Directing was terrific due to superb pacing - every minute of this movie wasn't boring or anything.", "You didn't rehearse that, did you Peter?": "Spiderman's name is,,, Peter Parker! - MysterioPeter's world isn't just turned upside down\nat the end of Far from Home,, it's turned sideways!!! Everywhere he goes, everyone knows he's Spiderman! This, along with the controversy that he supposedly murdered Mysterio and that the drones were controlled by him,, well it dismantles the lives of the ones closest to Peter as well. In hopes of restoring some balance to their lives, Peter asks Dr. Strange to cast a spell that will make everyone forget he is Spiderman. It does NOT go according to plan,,,Now,, for spoilers!!!Tom Holland and his gang are joined by all the main characters from the Sony Spiderman movies!!! Molina, Foxx, Church, Ifans, and Dafoe!!!! This, of course, brings McGuire and Garfield!!! It was epic!!!!! I don't want to spoil much,, but the scenes with the 3 Peter Parkers is everything you could want and more!!! This is a 9 rating!!!!! The best Spiderman movie by far!!", "BEST THING EVER": "Tears, laughs, nostalgia, heartache, emotional beats, everything about this movie is perfect. You won't regret watching it 5 times just for the effect. Ugh I need to get my next tickets asap.", "Didn't like it? I missed the part where that's my problem!": "Spider-man has been my all-time favorite superhero since I was a kid; to be more precise, Tobey Maguire was the only real spider-man for me and I was never able to even have the slightest interest for Andrew Garfield's spider-man. I remember wearing his suit when I was five or six years old after watching the Sam Raimi's trilogy for the 100th time and pretending that I was the friendly neighborhood spider-man. Who knows, maybe my passion for science came from these movies, cause you know, I'm something of a scientist myself. All these memories came rushing back to me after I heard the rumors about the possibility of multiverse in the new movie. I did not care if they would vitiate my good memories because of an awful storyline, all I needed was to see Tobey wearing his unique costume one more time. The moment he walked into the scene for the first time after fourteen years, the lyrics from \"No leaf clover\" by Metallica came to my mind: \"Good day to be alive Sir!\".I loved everything about the movie and I really appreciate the fact that the producers gave us another chance to see our beloved heroes and it even surpassed my expectation. Although, I would like to mention some of my opinions that I believe could make the perfect movie. The introduction of other Spider-men into the scene for the first time could have been way more exciting, however, it still did not stop the audience from expressing their huge emotions including myself. On the other hand, green goblin seemed so desperate in the first scenes before turning into the marvelous villain that we used to know. Moreover, I was expecting to see more fights between Doc Ock and Tom Holland when they met but apparently that scene was only made for the trailer to distract us from thinking about three Spider-men.Dialogues and interactions between characters were purely hilarious, not to mention the references to the old movies which have turned into memes nowadays. To be honest, I kept waiting for the moment to hear Tobey say \"I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye\", but I suppose that is never going to happen again.Right after the movie ended, I thought to myself how they can make another new MCU movie better than this one, because for me, this movie was the closest thing to an ideal movie after Sam Raimi's version. I have a feeling that spider-man (Tobey's) has shaped my personality and it has been a part of me for as long as I can remember, therefore, if I have to, I will wait another fourteen years to see him again, regardless of the story.", "The best Tom Holland Spiderman out of his other movie": "I totally love Toby and Andrew growing up. Love Andrew but his story is so bad i kind of forgot his story and only remembering his jumping, and flying style, which is really iconic since its used in spiderman games.I do think Aunt May in Tom spiderman is a bad irresponsible parents for him. And this movie just prove that true. I cannot believe how easy Tom lives because he seemed ignorant. I love dr Strange in here.In fact the movie execution is almot perfect. And i walk out of cinema very happily. :)", "Really good": "I really loved the first 2 Tom Holland Spiderman movies, and really think they are the most entertaining of the entire spiderman series so far. I was thinking this latest/biggest movie, looked like it was maybe a bit too rammed with badguys. But even some of its most questionable parts really pay off. Making for another ace adventure.There really is alot going on in the movie and casual viewers could be overwhelmed. But at its core its all still centred around Tom Hollands spiderman. As it should be. And he really steals the show from all the additional characters.There are of course lots of great jokes. Including the series making fun of some of its earlier stuff. There are alot of villians, but they're all returning characters, so don't feel underused. More like they're getting some extra time to shine. There maybe is still one too many though. It's all building up to a big finale. Where things maybe do go a bit overboard, and I got lost. But it all feels epic, and like a really huge event for fans and everyone else, so all worth it.I wasn't sure I liked some of the stuff going on with the ending at first. But thinking about it afterwards. The fans are just going to continue getting what they want here. Especially after the awesome mid credits scene.", "a terrible blockbuster": "Today I'm going to talk about Marvel's latest effort, the latest film from the MCU Spiderman: No Way Home, for the direction of John Watts.This film was a mediatic phenomenon, as we all know, there were high expectations and have been made a lot of assumptions by Marvel fans and not only. I think this hype is good for cinema in general but a terrible film like this isn't worth for all this hype, the others lose something because everyone have been to the cinema only for a film that I don't feel like call as such.The direction seems not to exist and unfortunately, I'm not kidding, everything is made by the computer and you don't understand anything. There isn't photography or cinematography, anything, not even a shot that you could remind, nothing remains in mind except the thought about the money you have spent for buying a ticket and watching this total idiocy.The previable plot has a lot of plot twist that do not add anything to the plot which is predictable, like the 90% of the events, so the story is a total idiocy.It seems like the people who written this film, which is not a real film, did not have any ideas and invented a mess for end in something obvious. The concept in the beginning is useless, so if I want to remove what is useless this film would last for like 15 mins.The screenwriting isn't decent, to add, with a lot of mandatory rules broken with narrative elements that are equal to all and not innovative, and all this fix me a question in mind: How did they write this film?The principal character are: Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spiderman, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange and the ones from the old Spiderman's films.Tom Holland's Spiderman isn't interesting because is like a dumb boy with stupid ideas that don't make sense, he wants to be a hero but he is incapable, it comes out badly. He is kid that acts in an unwatchable way, in fact he has two expressions; one when he's happy and the other one when he is sad, when he cries, he is ridicules and not credible.In conclusion his acting was cringe.Moreover, this Doctor Strange of Benedict Cumberbatch is like a child in fact he has behaviors truly questionable; he is stupid and the symbol of the terrible fanservice, he made thing that the old Doctor Strange would never do, he can't even do spells in the right way, c'mon. So, for resume everything in one word, he is an idiot.Thanks, this film, they demonstrated that the actors of the Sam Raimi's trilogy are the best, because they are such great actors and they work perfectly, from fantastic William Dafoe's Goblin to wonderful Otto Octavius of Alfred Molina.When I think that I spent my time in 2 hours and 30 min of vision, which are super long, for this terrible film, I feel sick, I wasted my time and everyone who watched it, because there isn't something new, it isn't cinema, only a product of marketing, only for sell tickets and so and so forth.Having seen this film, I'm really scared for upcoming new MCU movies, if this is the type there will be in the future I recommend Marvel to do a pleasure for itself and everyone else and close the doors and say goodbye to everyone.In conclusion, with all the hype there was for this terrible film, they could done it better, and it didn't take much in hindsight. They must not have the objective of satisfying the fans but only do something new that could be called entertainment and not repugnance in the vision, something that could not be called only fanservice but also cinema.", "MARVELOUS": "Not Just A Film, But A Tribute To Every Spiderman Fan...

I think my main problem is the comedy. First of all, I didn't find much of funny just super corny. But they also relied on it too much where I felt like it was detracting from the more serious moments. I was getting tonal whiplash. Am I supposed to be sad right now? Or Am I supposed to be laughing? And also I know movie has gotta movie and propel the plot forward but there were certain things that happened that felt WAY too convenient. And it sucks because this film genuinely has a good plot and themes. And some seriously dark moments in the film that gives it gravitas. I think I would have enjoyed the film more if they had just toned down some of the jokes, the meta, and some of the fan service to focus more on the story. I thought Tom Holland was great though and really stepped up into a more mature Spider-Man. And I thought the character arcs in general were good. Again, didn't hate the film. Lots of stuff to like, just overall not my favourite. I'm struggling how to rate this though...probably somewhere between a 6-7.", "Blast From The Past": "Being a mid-90s baby, I was the perfect age when the first few Spiderman movies came out. To say I was obsessed could very well be an understatement. Ive always enjoyed the depth of the Peter Parker character as well as the supporting roles (villains) around him. This movie does extremely well in bringing back those villains I loved so much growing up.Electro, Doc Oc, Sandman, The Lizard, and most importantly, Green Goblin all make appearences as shown in the trailer. Now first off, I want to say that Doc Oc is easily my favorite villain from those movies. However, Willem Dafoe shines the most in No Way Home as Norman Osborne/Green Goblin. 20 years has gone by, but he has proven that he is still the baddest of them all.Aside from the awesome perfomances from the old villians, we also get a much better look into the growth of Tom Holland as Peter Parker. This is his best perfomance yet as the web-slinging superhero, and the writers show that by not pulling any punches against his character in this film.You will laugh, you will cry, and you will cheer. Spiderman: No Way Home has given us a great look into the future of Marvel and what it means for our favorite Avengers. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!", "Spider-Man: No Way Home (What a wonderful movie)": "When you link the past of childhood with the present and the future, we say that it is something unusual. That's how we felt in Spider-Man No Way Home. The Marvel movie series always makes us feel something special emotionally and psychologically. This is how we feel in this movie. At first, when Peter Parker's secret was revealed, he wanted to fix his image in front of society after society know that he was the murderer of Mysterio. He wants to get his friends who are not guilty of Spider Man's actions to go to the university from which they were rejected because they are Peter Parker's friends. And then he went to Doctor Strange to help him that the whole world forget that Peter Parker is Spider Man. And here the amazing events began. Multiverse have been opened and everyone who knows Peter Parker has come to Peter Parker to take revenge on him. Bad guys we've known since childhood, Peter Parker the first, Peter Parker the second, and the third seeing them together fighting bad guys as if they were brothers is something I wished for ever since Spiderman appeared with the Avengers and here it is. What's sadder in the movie when May died and Peter Parker's reaction was this scene in which the director knew how to make people cry from a lot of sadness. Also when we saw Tobey Maguire, it was a more than wonderful scene, a scene that made us cry with a lot of joy. Events in which there is no boredom, the movie is more than wonderful in all respects. The soundtrack with the events and the battles with the bad guys is more than wonderful. Peter Parker's second scene when he saves M. G and does what he couldn't do is more than amazing scene. I hope we see another series where we see the three Spiderman together again. Finally, the end of the movie was realistic and a little sad, but it was a realistic ending and a prelude to the new Doctor Strange movie. I advise you to watch this movie immediately, thank you.", "Finally something good...": "Is it a 10, no.... but close. Its got the nostalgia bit, its got action and it doesn't lecture. If you want a good movie, you got it. As for superhero movies this is the best of 2021.", "Spectacular Spider-Man!!!": "After the trailers and building hype, No Way Home delivers what fans want and more. Tom Holland is at his best as Peter Parker in what is possibly his strongest Spider-Man outing yet.This is the first of the MCU Spider-Man that stands outside the shadow of Iron Man and Holland's Spiderman finally feels like Spider-Man in his own right. He delivers an excellent performance and manages to stand out in the sea of returning characters. The supporting cast is excellent with Marissa Tomei finally standing out as Aunt May.The returning villains were a huge part of the marketing and the writers give these previous antagonists the respect and reveverance they deserve and some have even been improved. Alfred Molina continues to be excellent as Otto Octavius delivering a compelling character arc that does not compromise what came before. Jamie Foxx redeems Electro and finally makes him feel like a threatening antagonist in comparison to TASM 2. But the standout has to be Willem Dafoe, returning as Norman Osborn and he makes his already excellent villain a truly threatening villain and elevates the character to the position of perhaps the greatest live action Spider-Man villain. Spider-Man does battle with these villains in some of the best fights to come out of Tom Holland's Spider-Man movies even with the occasional dodgy CGI.Overall, No Way Home delivers the best action and emotion of Holland's trilogy and perhaps can stand as one of the best Spider-Man movies. The main villains are superb, and Tom Holland's Spider-Man finally feels like his own man outside of the shadow of Iron Man and the MCU.", "The real AMAZING Spider-Man": "Hands down the best Marvel movie to date. Very clever. I am not one to watch movies multiple times in the cinema but I could watch this on repeat. The surprises keep coming. I love a good throwback.", "A resurrection": "Definitely an amazing movie. The reunion was so special to see, it was wonderful to see the previous 2 spidermans in this movie. I really, really loved it. It proves that it is not always bad to bring back some of the elements, characters or even actors from the previous movies. It takes skill to implement old elements, treat them with respect and make them turn out great in a new movie. The fact that Andrew's Peter Parker saved this universe's MJ was a touch that must have had long-time fans (me included) grabbing for tissues.Other than that I can't wait to see the next movie. I think Tom is a great Spiderman, though all 3 of the actors are the best Spiderman, there simply isn't one who is better than the other. They all portrayed the character in amazing but different ways and it's lovely to see them together to notice their impact.Furthermore, all performances in this movie were great, I really can't think of any bad points in this movie. Definitely recommend watching.", "What is so exciting about this one?": "This one was exactly like how I expected it to be. I knew who all was going to be in the movie. The trailer itself makes it pretty clear. It was just clumsy writing. Poor reasons after poor reasons to bring in certain characters.I don't get the high praise for this one. Maybe the people who praise this are all meme lords or something. Or they must've watched every Marvel movie and tv series twice or thrice.If you are a casual moviegoer like me, you'll probably find this one just average.", "Didn't like one bit of it.": "Really it was awful. I'm just surprised how it got a 9 star rating? Fixed maybe. I mean superheroes often do stupid things to start a storyline but this Spiderman has won the crown of stupidity. And doctor strange is what? Now losing from a kid called Spiderman? Spiderman is so so stupid to change the whole world because him and 2 others failed to get admission in some crap. Honestly I feel Tom Holland is the worst Spiderman and this movie are the worst Spiderman movie ever. I feel the best Spiderman was tobey Maguire. He was and will always be the best.", "Decent...not sure what these 10/10 are about": "Thanks to writers Erik Sommers and Chris McKenna, Tom Holland is officially the dumbest and most annoying spiderman ever.I didnt like how they couldnt be creative and do something else but to do an Into the Spider Verse live action.Production 8/10.Acting 7/10\nScript. 6/10\nDirector. 6/10Would i recommend it? Sure, if you got nothing else to do.", "Best marvel movies ever, they are the best!": "Tom Holland delivers once again in this crazy marvel movie! I love the way he acts, and this movie might be better than the first 3 movies of spiderman(by raimy) i think most people will be entertained by the fun and storyline, it is a great continuation of the spiderman universe and one of the best films in many years(since endgame)I think most people will like the surprises in this movie, doctor strange is in this movie in twist that i will no reveal here, very smart done.Great movie go watch it.", "My expectations were so high and I wasn't disappointed": "This movie is great. There is nothing more to it. Tom Holland gave a great performance. Seeing Tobey and Andrew made me cheese like the portal scene did in Endgame. This movie did everything it set out to do and more. If you're reading this and you haven't seen the movie. Go watch it right now. I don't give 10/10 because I don't believe in a perfect movie, but this movie really will come as close as movies get.", "They are Spidermen": "This one takes the trophy out of all Spiderman movies. Loved every second, action packed, amazing story lines, great concept, and what makes it even outstanding is how all three Spiderman connect even from diverse Multiverses from pain hardship and the birth of a brotherhood. They are all different but still appreciate each other and know what's their strengths and limits as a Spiderman team. SO AWESOME TO SEE\ud83d\udcaf\ud83c\udf89 AGAIN Octavius, Electro, Sandman, reptile and Green goblin... This one give avengers endgame a run for its star count.", "Very good.": "When I first saw a trailer for this I thought it looked a bit over the top, I thought the whole mutliverse thing was confusing. However, having watched the film I've decided that I really liked it. The multiverse was exciting, and it was especially nice to see Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield back as alternate Spider men, it was also great to see previous villains back.", "Best MCU/Spider-Man Series Movie Yet": "THIS IS IT.THIS IS IT.THIS IS IT, AND ALL WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR.This movie defines surprise and all the possibilities in the Spider-Man Series movie. The setting was smooth and the transition between and into from the second (Far From Home) and third (No Way Home) is exceptional.Every single scene was portrayed well, and all the emotions tide up our taste and heart. This is the only movie where the whole audience would scream, cheer, laugh, yell, wow, and clap.The cast is definitely amazing and it just accomplished all the marvel and Spider-Man fan's dreams.The movie definitely did an excellent job connecting different universes and explaining how all three Spider-Man tied up and influence others. Where they have the same similar background and story. One of my favorite scenes was during the final battle when MJ fall down and Tom Holland did not catch her; Andrew Garfield jump down to save MJ. Where because in his universe/story, his girlfriend Gwen died because she fall and Andrew failed to save her. Where this time, he accomplished his story/will/dream, fulfilled his mistake, proven to himself, and also saved a life. And this is such an incredible move, and also such an emotional moment that tied up everyone's heart together.Near the ending scene in the coffee shop after everyone's memory about Peter Parker was erased. When Tom Holland was back and see MJ, he is now just a stranger to all his friends, family, and members in his life. The scene is so sad and the Director delivers the message so well that it truly touched me and tears are just falling from my eye nonstop. I was crying so hard and I cried again later. But it is definitely worth the tear.", "Best Marvel, best Spiderman movie": "Amazing. It will be difficult to top this one. In the entire Spiderman universe, this has got to be the best. Spider-Man: No Way Home is more than just a Spiderman tribute. It is more than just a dedication to all the faithful fans. It is more than just the redemption of Sony for how it had previously handled the Spiderman franchise. This film puts Spiderman front and centre in the Marvel Multi-Verse, where he rightfully belongs! Closes a long, long chapter, and now opens a new one! It's also for fans who have grown with Tom Holland as the new Spider-man and now see the world with greater maturity and growing into adulthood. It's emotionally bittersweet, yet satisfying close. The film is not perfect but it checks all the right boxes. For Marvel fans, you cannot NOT watch this one as it ties directly to the multiverse and the What-If TV series. I believe that going to be the most talked about Spiderman film for a long, long time because there's so much to digest in this film in terms of the story-telling. So please go watch it soonest possible so that the rest of us who are going to watch a few more times can finally talk about it...properly!", "One of the best Spiderman movies out there watch it:)": "I still don\u00b4t know if this is better than spider man 2(yes the original with Tobey Maguire) the second one was a masterpiece by Sam Raimi.Now this one is up there, and you will enjoy every second of it from beginning to end.The anticipation for a Marvel movie certainly hasn't been this high since 'Avengers: Endgame' two and a half years ago! In this movie spider man have to find himself, since he is lost and alone.. he turnes to another great artist from the marvel universe, you have to watch the movie to see it for yourself.)The movie is very emotional and the writing is very good.Well lets say it this way, I still can't get over how good this movie was! Had me on the edge of my seat almost the whole time. Fantastic film.Watch it! 10/10!", "See This Movie - Now": "I give this movie a solid 9/10 - and to be honest, being a Marvel/Sony movie it probably deserves a 10/10 for what it has done. It's a great movie - the best Spider-Man movie by far and definitely up there for MCU movies (though Endgame probably best movie for me... this one is incredible) won't go into spoilers though they are everywhere at this point. It's an absolutely well executed, best chapter in the trilogy - best chapter in the SpiderMan Mythos. Well done all around. Look forward to seeing this again with my other kids who didn't get the change tonight.", "Just watch it!": "I loved this movie! It was totally worth it to go to movie cinema for this spectacular show.It was best superhero movie in last 10 years.I want say thank you to genius young actor: Tom Holland. He was so charismatic and believable that my heart was almost stopping while watching.The plot itself is another big plus. You will see few clever twists and not expected ending.Just loved it.", "BEST MARVEL/SPIDER-MAN/ COMIC BOOK MOVIE OF ALL TIME!": "You may feel all kinds of emotional feelings a human being can feel at once!This movie contains everything a movie should have\nAnd i personally enjoyed nostalgic parts the best.", "This is mediocre nostalgia": "While I could say that the movie was complete garbage for the majority, it was the salvation from a 1star film by Dafoe, Garfield, McGuire, and Cumberbach. However many of the jokes fall flat on their face, many of the moments that should've felt like \"achievement\" felt like participation award simply for doing. Even then there are so many holes to fill that do not make sense. Without spoiling it in a absolute way, there are also some serious questions about some of what happened that really are bad.I believe most people will love this simply for it's touch of nostalgia, I don't believe it merits a worthy enough film simply based on that. I felt that everything seemed so rushed and smashed together that I am sure I missed elements that may also come into question that I didn't catch. As for the ones I did, believe me it's bad. I especially didn't care for the racial comment in it but regardless, I felt that the 5stars are warranted for the nostalgia and performance by those special few.The fact is that also this didn't understand Peter Parker, Spider-Man, or any of the villains. It was very much in question what kind of nonsensical idiot would've done some of the things they do in this film along with everything \"just so happened\" to be just the thing/action/power they needed. This was a win for Tony Stark, and Starktech but for Spiderman this was barely mediocre - thank Toby and Andrew for saving this movie from the fire.", "The Perfect Spider-Man Film": "The amount of strong emotions Jon Watts packs into Spider-Man: No Way Home is incredible. The pure joy of watching this movie will never fade. It's funny, sad, nostalgic, and everything in between. And every one of those emotions hits home. It's raw, it's powerful, and there is no Spider-Man movie like this. Each character is fun to see, and none of them have a dull, stagnant moment. Tom Holland gave Peter Parker his all, and I couldn't be happier with the outcome. Willem Dafoe gave a chilling, Oscar-worthy performance as Green Goblin. Benedict Cumberbatch was a great addition and a pure joy as Stephen Strange. Alfred Molina was heartwarming to see. And to top it off - we get none other than Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire. The final fight scene put a smile on my face as I watched in the theaters. It's such a spectacle, and every second of it is extravagant. It's been 6 months since the release of this movie and I still couldn't be happier with what we got. It is a game changer in the superhero world, and there will be nothing quite like it. It's such a rewarding movie, and I still can't believe it exists. I hope to see more of Tom Holland's Peter Parker in the future, because there is nothing quite like it.", "Childish and boring": "Cheesy, cringy jokes every 5 minutes, the same old Marvel formula! It seems this formula works at making money, i wonder why? Well, it means people's tastes in movies is worse and worse every year! They pay to watch those childish marvel..things! But this is one of the many cases in wich big money does not mean QUALITY! Spider-Man man is no longer Spider-Man! Is Iron Boy! Tom Holland must be the worst actor to play this role of Spidey Boy! Zendaya is the worst actress i have ever seen! The only good things in the movie was some special effects and Tobey Maguire apareance! Now this..thing is in top 17 movies of all times based on ratings, above real masterpieces, and this make me lose faith in humanity!", "Honestly... I liked the previous two more": "In my opinion , the idea of establishing a thread between the previos spidey generations is defenitely ingenious and to be praised.Combined with some great visuals and spectacular CG effects this should be one of the best Marvel's achievements.Ufortunatelly not.The story is lazy and slow, saved only by the slightly more clever ending. The scenes that are supposed to be funny are just lame, ackward and unecessary. But what I've really missed was the friendship energy that distinguished Spider-man from all the other Marvel movies.To be honest I've enyojed the previos two chapters more... its definitely not a 7 but neither a solid 8 rating from me...", "A Spectacle": "This is the movie for a Spider fan. Endgame vibes throughout the film. It's not a perfect movie by any stretch but the emotional payoff in this trilogy for Tom Holland's Spider-Man is fantastic. Powerful performances delivered by several of the cast members. Get ready to feel the full range of emotions.", "Ok.": "It wasn't as grand and spectacular as everyone rave about. I was expecting something marvellous, but all I get was a half filled glass of water that should've been filled and overflown. A missed opportunity to fully utilise the awe-inspiring scope of the Spider-Verse.Just like Jon Watts' previous Spider-Man films, this one too turn Peter into an annoying teenager who mess up everything. I hate it when they turn my favorite comic book characters unbearable. Tom Holland's performance was sometimes so bleak and annoying.", "One of the best marvel films I think ever made": "This film completely lived up to my expectations and that is saying alot as I absolutely adore marvel. The storyline I thought flowed really well and they introduced the characters from the previous film in a great way. Honestly, I was worried that they would ruin it and make it cringey but it was absolutely fantastic. Would highly recommend.", "It is the best movie of 2021": "It recreated my childhood (I never thought that I will see Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfeild and Tom Holland in same movie (I don't knoew i'm gonna experience such a movie again). I wish I could show this to my family but it is not available on OTT.", "Yeah, It's Really That Good!!!": "Tough to make one better than this - delivers across the board - so much fun, so complete - it's got it all! And yeah, it's really that good. Fantastic!", "Amazing? No.": "I purposely didn't want any trailers as these days, they ruin movies and reveal most of the good stuff. Not many of the key action scenes from the movie were not in the trailer. Peter Parker came off as very annoying, definitely in scenes with Dr Strange and when Peter wanted to \"try\" to save the lives of the opponents from other universes. But what really frustrated me was the blatant product placement of the Hyundai, there was no need whatsoever for it to feature in the scene it did the way it did. It stopped centre on camera and the audience got a good view of this new car. Surely Sony didn't need that extra cash? Entertaining but not revolutionary. Dune was much better.", "With great stakes comes great expectations. And boy, were those expectations exceeded.": "This movie is... incredible. Out of all the Spider-Man movies I have seen (The original Raimi trilogy and the MCU trilogy), this one is the best. And that's saying a lot, because Spider-Man 2 was an absolute masterpiece that made me really appreciate not just Spider-Man, but Peter Parker, the boy behind the mask who wants so desperately to live two separate lives, one as a superhero with the responsibility to save the lives of the people around him, and another as just a regular, gold-hearted kid with friends and family. All that being said, however, the reason I like No Way Home more than Spider-Man 2 is because I had not actually seen the Raimi trilogy until AFTER I saw No Way Home, as that movie is what made me realize how deep Spider-Man actually is and that I wanted to look more into him. So, me loving this movie the most is almost definitely because of my personal experience with it. It sparked my interest in the webbed hero with just a kid behind the mask, and it did so while also living up to the expectations of long-time veterans and fans of him. This movie is an absolute must see if you are at all interested in Spider-Man. While it may not be perfect and have its flaws (like the pacing at some points being a bit weird and having quite a slow, drawn-out startup), it is still an absolute masterpiece in the Marvel series, and the writers, directors, and all others involved in the making of this film can be happy knowing that Stan Lee is smiling down upon them from heaven, truly proud of how his beautiful character and universe is being carried on to soar high.", "Nostalgia meets lazy writing": "Please stop celebrating mediocrity. The premise was super-exciting but the execution really poor. I can understand the hype for Andrew and Tobey however I cannot swallow the really shallow and dumb plot full of holes and unforeseen conveniences.The problem is that people are used to mediocre marvel plots just because the are fed with some cool visuals. Doctor Strange was also completely out of character here.", "Best Film of 2021": "This is without a doubt the best film of last year. This is one of the best films in the MCU and is definitely on par with Spider-Man 2 for my favorite Spider-Man film. It is chocked full of surprises. In terms of filmmaking Dune was more well made and crafted, but in terms of what entertained me and me laugh, feel emotion for... No Way Home delivered. I saw it three times, and though I will admit there are some plot holes but nothing too distracting. It's a celebration of the character of Spider-Man and why he is so beloved by many including myself.", "Tobey made this movie 10/10": "Tobey Maguire was great. Everything else was just good.The crowd was cheering once our hero return back to the screen as a marvelous true Spider Man.", "An average film hiding behind nostalgia": "Let me get to the point, this film is just a crossover attempt to cash in nostalgia and is easily the weakest of the three Spider-Man films so far.The action is great but lost is the humour and the plot, if you break down the story of this film you quickly realise that \"into the spider verse\" did it better. The story of the film doesn't have the development of the previous films, the introduction of previous people just felt crammed in for the sake of it.The plot:\nI'm Spider-Man\nSpell goes wrong\nSend them back\nNo I want to cure them\nIt goes wrong\nCures them\nSend them backCompare it to the actual plot of say mysterio trying to steal stark tech and cashing in on peters emotions it just felt weak. The cameos are lack lustre as well only two guys really perform well with others just throwing in a line here or there, the whole thing was a nostalgia grab.In my eyes this film with Peter being revealed should have been Spider-Man the fugitive being hunted down, introduce kraven and a Jameson backed scorpion, have a death of a major character in Spider-Man's life and then fearing more people being hurt go to dr strange for a \"forget who I am\" spell and lead into this film. The reason for wanting a spell here is \"my friends are sad\" it's just felt like a weird jump from one film to the next and it makes me worry for dr strange 2, too many characters apparently now means sacrificing genuine story.People say this is the best marvel film but I say take those nostalgia glasses off and compare this actual story to into the spider verse or the previous films and review it again. It's a solid average action spectacle but lacking a real plot. Kids will adore it though.", "A game changer. The ultimate spiderman movie.": "If you follow the marvel movies and shows, this one is an absolute must see. Even if you dont follow the movies, this is just top notch entertainment. No Way Home had completely fulfilled every expectation and more.The story is somewhat tricky so there is a bit of listening or knowledge of the previous films required. The action is somehow getting better and better. Willem Dafoe and Alfed Molina seamlessly jump back into character after all these years and Goblin kicks alot more ass this time. They even bring in some old music from the Raimi films. And the parts I can't spoil.... wow. You just have to see it, beyond being a superhero movie, it truly broke cinematic ground. Spidey saved theatres!", "Honestly, I don't think I could have asked for much more": "I will preface this by saying I'm a huge Spiderman fan and that if there was anything that was wrong with this movie I would have been more critical than a typical movie.Luckily, I can say that No Way Home was literally everything my little spider boy heart could have hoped and imagined this movie to be and then some.I laughed, I cried, I yelped...this is decades worth of built up characters that so many people know and love. Instantly when certain characters show up (you know who TF I'm talking about) people who got to see the earlier Spiderman movies instantly are invested.The thing that I would criticize this movie for was the reasoning of certain plot elements, such as how Tom Holland trying to save the villain from the other universes so this causes an issue with then getting sent back to their timelines. That's just a bit of silly premise but I really couldn't care less because of how much fan service was in this movie.This is the movie Spiderman fans could have only dreamt of during a wet dream. Yeah, I'm probably going to watch it like 30 times too. Do something about it.", "A lot of fun": "I thought this was probably the most entertaining Spider-Man live action movie that has been made. Even at 2 1/2 hours, it left me wanting more. The characters were way more likable here than their other appearances, and I was way more invested in this story. One thing that bothered me was how the plot depended on an incredibly goofy character decision. I didn't think there was any way a person would ever choose that route--even a fictional superhero. Also, I wasn't as enamored with the villains as most people seem to be. But the high points more than made up for that. Definitely worth watching back.", "Wow, just WOW": "This film reached top tier quality at the begining, and simply kept going up!Personally, I went back to the theaters multiple times to rewatch this masterpiece. But, it wasn't just something you watched... it's an experience.From the character growth of Peter (Holland), Ned, and MJ to the relationships between the Spidermen (Holland, Maguire, Garfield) the storyline was all around very well put together.The fact that Strange says \"we\" when discussing the erasing of Peter Parker (Holland) from the memories of everyone on Earth, showed a deeper emotion from him that we don't normally see throughout other Marvel movies. It was a nice hint towards his true feelings.Though I was upset when Aunt May passes, it was a moment that connects all versions of Spider-man together. The fact that the line \"with great power, comes great responsibility\" is in her final few words, ties the overall idea that has been shown since Maguire and Garfield were Peter. Now, Holland is part of them as well.The relationship between the three Spider-men was absolutely perfect. It's what every Spider-man and Marvel fan needed/wanted to see. Each Peter finally got to have a sibling-like relationship with people who understand exactly what they are going through.In conclusion, the ending of the film was both heart wrenching and calming at the same time. Though Ned and MJ do not know who Peter is anymore, it gives an idea of where Hollands new films will go next. But it also leaves open questions that will hopefully be answered soon!", "Easily this year's most satisfying blockbuster": "Easily this year's most satisfying blockbuster, featuring an epic story and moments that fans will keep close to their hearts for years to come. Yes, it is obvious fan service in parts and you're never completely surprised by any of it, but it still works because the whole thing is so well-executed.", "Great, Amazing, Heartbreaking, Nostalgic but lazy at points": "The movie itself is groundbreaking. It fills you with so much e,Orion when everyone forgets Peter, Aunt May dies and the final fight against Goblin. It was great to see all the villains back but at points it felt like they got a bit lazy like Lizard got left out most of the movie, Eleectro never knew Peter was Spider-Man and Doc Ock was just gone the entire third act. Like what was he doing. Was he hanging out at MJ's coffee shop. And Tom Harry's Venom should've had more screen time. Now let's talk about Tobey and Andrew, it was great to see them back but I felt like it at points they did try a bit too hard with the laughs except when the mentioned the Spider-Man pointing meme. Overall great movie with some defiance flaws but my secon favourite MCU movie anyway just behind Captain America The Winter Soldier.", "The Spider-Man film that'll likely make you feel like Spider-Man": "Let the film marinate, the hype wear down and then conclude: That was totally wicked!Spider-Man: No Way Home has had all the hype behind it and Kevin Feige and the crew behind and in front of the camera does not disappoint. It's been marketed as the biggest film since Endgame and well, they delivered. No Way Home will hype old fans and new fans alike. It is intense.As it's still very early days of the release this is a SPOILER FREE review.TLDR at the bottom.Tom Holland has comfortably planted his feet into this role and this time round he gets to shine in his 3rd solo outing as a 17 year old with his friends going through typical situations 17 year olds and friends go through, but yaknow whilst being Spider-Man but it doesn't come without its gripes. The pacing. The film starts with a fantastic opening sequence starting right where the previous film left off and we're put in the middle of the chaos. Its exhilarating, frantic and well in the future it bodes well for anyone on a Spider-Man marathon. However, as soon as the opening dies down, so does the pacing. We're put through slow scenes for quite some time. Long enough to say in your head \"Oh get on with it\" but short enough to say, \"To be fair, this pacing is necessary because we know it's gonna be an all-out battle at the end in true Marvel fashion\". It's something that works but feels uneven as we go from fast to slow to fast.Further, my gripes with most MCU films, some of the jokes fall flat. The writing here for the most part is great, nothing stand out. It fits the tone but in true Marvel fashion there's moments that can break the tension because of a poorly placed joke; nothing as bad as an epic scene from GotG 2 (2017) of them getting in formation in all it's epicness then getting bonked on the head, but these are more dialogue jokes that just don't land. I.e., the scene shown in a trailer of Peter and Co. Making fun of Doc Ock.Speaking of the villains, one thing I feared is that we all knew the villains of previous movies would appear in this film and I had hoped that they didn't diminish the core of these villains by turning them into jokes but I'm glad to say this isn't true - for the most part. When it does happen, it's a short time and it's quickly followed by something grand.With all the above being said, the good stuff is great.The cinematography is noteworthy. Right off the bat you can tell that the cinematography is unlike any prior MCU Spider-Man film. Mauro Fiore, the cinematographer on films like Avatar (2009) and Training Day (2001), does a phenomenal job of putting you directly in the scene for maximum immersion. The long tracking shots allows you take in the entirety of the scene and feel the frustration or the chaos ensuing on screen, whilst the slow scaling in on shots allows you to feel the emotions the characters are going through. Fiore also knows how to make you look at a static shot in awe. The lighting, the depth of field. It looked crisp. Honestly, at times I forgot that this was part of the MCU. Overall, visually, this film was a treat to the eyes. There are sequences that are trippy, I mean Dr Strange is in this film, and there are sequences full of what you expect of a blockbuster Marvel film.The cinematography also conveyed the tone of the film. The light-hearted teenage film remains as it did in prior films but there are times where scenes play out and it gets darker, the crowd goes silent and the hairs on your arm stand up. In all solo films, this is the one that Holland gets to act his heart out. This is pushed by the fact that the narrative is more mature as it deals with moral conflict, and it does make you think about character decisions and the brutality of it depicted on screen via the acting and narrative. The storyline presents the audience with real stakes which is fuelled by the TV shows and just knowing the general direction the MCU is heading, and this real stakes thing is not something you see often in an MCU film.Whilst each scene has it's action and poignant moments, it's the soundtrack that highlights the scene. For the most part it blends into the background of each scene, and it emphasises the scenes' emotions, but in one particular instance the soundtrack was operatic and it sends chills down your spine. It was beautiful to hear.Jon Watts does a fantastic job with presenting old villains to our current cast, and I'm blown away at how he and the writers: Chris Mckenna and Erik Sommers manage to balance the characters out whilst still allowing us to feel the emotions that the characters go through. We don't need to see development of each villain as we've already had backstories on them all, and that's used to its advantage as in turn, it makes this a Spider-Man film. Watts also manages to create a fan favourite film - many times a scene would play out and, in my head, I would think \"This'll be cool if this shot was next to accentuate the scene\" and boom the shot appears. He knows his audience and how to reach them, in this film more than ever.This is aided by the supporting cast. Zendaya, Jacob Batalon and Marisa Tomei play their respective roles adequately as they push Peter in his internal and external battles and act as comic relief from time to time but along with the darker tone, allows us to also get invested in them as characters and their relationships to Peter.Now how does this film fit into the MCU? Well first of all, its definitely towards the top of the rankings in the MCU films and whilst it may not set up anything, it gives us a taste of what the MCU can achieve with the multiverse. We know that's coming with the upcoming Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). We have to also remember that we were all under the impression this was Tom Holland's last outing as the wall crawler and if that had remained true, this film was a fitting send off.There are many surprises along the way. My eyes teared up from joy, from sorrow, I laughed, I got invested. All in all I walked out the cinema hyped so much that before I even thought about writing this review, I had to wait a day to ensure that I wasn't blinded by the hype.Overall, this was a fantastic entry into the MCU and I imagine rewatching this film 10 times over would still make you feel like the first time you watched it.P. S. A massive kudos to the director, the writers and everyone that worked on this film. A film of this magnitude is difficult to pull off and daunting to say the least. The amount of expectations and hype surrounding the film before the release is one thing but to be able to pull it off on this grand of a scale and leaving fans happy is astounding.P. P. S. Now we know what they can do, bring on the X-Men & F4.At some point a spoiler review will be coming and can get into more specific things.TLDR: It's a solid film and a solid addition to the MCU.", "You won't BREATHE. Once in a lifetime experience!": "This movie was made for Spider-man lovers, not particularly but STRICTLY. If you're looking for a story in the greatest level, you won't get it. NWH is strong in surprises, soundtrack, performances, visuals, emotional depth and the crazy fan-service. While the story is predictable at times, the insane ensemble cast just steals our attention and gives us everything we ever wanted in this movie. Thank you SONY for making this DREAM-MOVIE. I'll never forget it. Please guys, just go watch it.", "A near masterpiece of its kind, truly an incredible accomplishment for the MCU": "Fans of the MCU and other Marvel films are in for a treat! My expectations were modest going in as it is very easy to mess up such a large juggling of characters. My expectations were exceeded with easily one of the best films made so far. Every time these filmmakers set a new high bar, they continue to find ways to impress.I have to criticize some debatable character inconsistencies that act as plot devices to get things going into the chaos that is the plot. For the most part, though, it worked even if more could have been done with such an ambitious concept. The success comes mainly from what I have to say below.Just about every factor that went into making this film was done with the utmost care. Even though I mentioned a few plot device inconsistencies above, the character focus in this movie is strong and fully realized to further expand chemistries in our main cast. The emotional appeal is stronger than ever and we really feel the power with outstanding performances and antagonist thrills.Not only does this movie combine universes' characters, it also blends together themes presented from those universes for a whole heartedly meaningful purpose beyond fan fare. That is truly the most impressive accomplishment in my opinion. An intellectual achievement. It also did very well with combining humor with the more serious moments.Michael Giacchino outdid himself this time around with a musical score that shows an understanding of the scenes' emotions and intensity. Too often do action movies switch too quickly between slow and fast-paced, but here we have good transitions and unexpected power during the crucial moments. Additionally, the action scenes themselves were smoothly filmed and accompanied by awesome visuals at times.Overall, a great film in this universe that opens the door to complex possibilities. The strong character focus sells this film with refreshingly new ways of defeating antagonists and a third act that plunges into powerful and even heartbreaking moments. It was all subtle enough to work without being over the top, and even though more could have been done, this is a movie I will not soon forget. A near masterpiece in the superhero genre that took on new narrative grounds with high quality results.", "Run of the mill": "Another cookie cutter film by Marvel with nothing truly special expect the fanfare given by recasting old actors.It's competent but honestly felt like a waste of time, would only recommend it if you're a marvel/spiderman fan.", "What a load of crap!": "Dont they realise that their viewers have grown up.This is a cartoon! Not a movie.Juat adding tonnes of characters, each scene predictable. Fake emotions. No story. No pathos.", "My favourite Spider-Man movie from now": "I know people have their own opinions and might disagree with mine. You may still prefer Raimi's Spider-Man 2 or Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse to be the best. But THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE.I walked out of the theatre with my brother and we didn't talk about the movie until we got home, speechless yet with a massive grin :DI agree a few things were rushed, eg: Sandman's and Lizard's character development.But they went for a really dark, realistic Spider-Man journey and this maybe the best performance by Tom Holland in the MCU as Spider-Man.I'm not gonna spoil the movie, GO WATCH IT YOURSELF ;)Tobey's Peter and Andrew's Peter have exceptional character development and Andrew's redemption arc is the scene you wanna see in the movie.Another really positive feature in this movie is the consequences. We haven't seen many consequences in the previous MCU Spider-Man movies as they aimed for a light-hearted version. But this movie has it all, physical consequences including an important character death and relationship consequences involving (Tom's) Peter in the future.And oh my god, Willem Dafoe.... my man killed it. His Green Goblin is the best Spider-Man villain. Dafoe's presence on screen giving an unsettling feel and putting you on the edge of your seat along with his menacing performance seals the deal.Overall in my opinion, the positives easily outweigh the negatives by a long shot. This movie is completely worth the watch no just for fanservice, but also for a well-made, not overwhelming, emotionally driven Spider-Man movie.", "Fan Service with a Dash of Depth": "I've definitely cooled on this movie after seeing it. We all know what was coming, but man I cheered like crazy with the theater audience when our other Spideys showed up regardless. However, as the dust settled, I've been able to step back and can still confidently say this movie is still pretty good when you take out the shock value. This is mostly because of the emotional connection and depth they delve into between the Peters. They found a way to make all the stories we've seen before tie together (albeit loosely) to further help develop Holland's character journey. This was more the surprise for me. This doesn't touch Endgame-level in my book, but it's a great Marvel film.", "Magical mayhem": "Great cast & storyline. It is good & chemistry between the leads are believable. Marvel does it again & continuing their hot streak of making good films. DC film makers need to take note & follow by example!This is like the personification of being on one of the best rollercoasters ride but in film form. I cannot wait to see the next installment of this franchise.", "Exhilarating": "I've been a web-head all my life and tonight I left the theater with the biggest smile on my face. This movie is everything I've ever wanted and I am never going to forget it.All the characters have been handled so well. Spider-Man's arc in this film was insane and very well-written. The pacing of the movie was perfect. The cinematography took me by surprise. It was unlike any other Spider-Man film and one of the best of all comicbook movies. The camera movements during fights were perfect and the score was captivating. Truly exhilarating stuff. It really does justice to the source material.Greatest live action Spider-Man movie and one of the best CBM of all time. Best cinematic experience since Endgame. I am going to watch it over and over again for the rest of my life.", "What a ride": "Marvel's fans wet dreams are coming true!!!!This was a real joyride from the beginning to the end.

The film is a sequel to the Spider-Man film series. It was nominated for 1 Oscar as Best Achievement in Visual Effects.The action takes place in Iceland in our time. Peter Parker's secret identity is revealed to the entire world. Desperate for help, Peter turns to Doctor Strange to make the world forget that he is Spider-Man. Unfortunately, the spell goes horribly wrong and shatters the multiverse, bringing in monstrous villains that could destroy the world.Zendaya is excellent as MJ, and Tom Holland also gives a great perfomance as Peter Parker, who has to look into the eyes of real old-school villains, people and creatures imbued with hatred or obsessed with their own ideas. The screenplay holds from beginning to end; the special effects are wonderful and soundtrack is superb.The word that best describes this movie is engaging. This is one of the best action-adventure films i've ever seen. In my view, it's suitable for adults and teenagers alike.", "BLOCKBUSTER": "#SuperDirection #AwesomeStory #Blockbuster #Rocking #UnbelievableIt was a great experience watching Spiderman no way home 3d in theatre.

I genuinely loved this Spider-Man more than all the others. Zendaya is phenomenal, Tom Holland is spectacular! The visuals were amazing, the storyline was wonderful. The cameos were superb. 10/10!!!", "Story 7 nostalgia 10": "The movie is honestly pretty bad. The movie before tobey and Andrew comes in is pretty boring. The only good parts are the Old spider men the Old villains and nothing else. Cinematography is nothing special, score is nothing special, special effects is honestly awful, tom and zendaya super Weird and unrealistic couple. The only thing that saves it is the cameos.", "Not a masterpiece, but it will go down in history": "I didn't expect it to be that good. They did an amazing job and hit right in the nostalgia.The jokes were good(there 1-2 cringe though), they introduced us the old Spidermans with a really smart way and the villains were also really good. It had the amount of drama and brutality it needed and the music was also amazing.The only that I was a bit meh with was the ending. I don't understand what happened in the Maguire's and Garfield's world. Did they forget everything that happened and the story changed or something else? And it's also kinda sad that Tom ended up completely alone but with a new trilogy planned we have more to see so I'm not really worried.It was amazing, beautiful, it was a lifetime experience and I will never forget it. Remember guys, with great power...", "Lived up to the hype.": "Brilliant movie. Offering all kinds of emotions through out. Perfectly blending nostalgia and the modern MCU.

I was depressed and sad by the ending , not because it was bad but because what happened to Peter . I felt so bad for him . It was filled with Happiness , sadness and spookyness. I mean the entrance of Electro and a certain scene with goblin was super scary . There was definetely some flaws in the first half but once certain special people enter the movie in the second half , this movie becomes the best movie of this year . Loved this movie.", "Another Over-Hyped disney-marvel movie....": "First off, this was better than the last one but not by much. For the record, I think marvel has done some great films such as Iron Man, Captain America Civil War, Winter Soldier, The Avengers films, Guardians of the Galaxy 1, but the others have generally felt okay to meh.The new spidey once again has spidey needing a bunch of help from other \"avengers\" and even some \"other people whom I don't want to spoil\". Add to that, the increased screen time of the wanna-be MJ (I really can't stand the character, actress (if you can call her that) and the changing of a beloved character), a mellow-dramatic spiderman, and lame incorporation of past villians.The action is good but the sound is typical disney trash as it's too flat. Overall, there are some good things tossed in the film but it's not enough to bring it to being as good as Homecoming (even though I didn't think it was that great as well).I often feel as if the audiences of today have been fed so many bad films that they have become accustomed to bad films that if anything is slightly better than that it's considered GREAT. Add to this problem are the countless so called \"professional\" reviewers who constantly praise disney/marvel because they don't want to lose their precious free viewing to films before the public (disney has gone after reviewers for giving negative reviews). Basically, if you like the crap being put out I'm sorry for you, but it is what it is.This film is a easy pass and I wish I could get the hours back that I wasted seeing this.", "I Loved It!!": "This is it, my friends, the best entry in the Spider-Man series (which is saying a lot). The cast is excellent with Holland the best. He looks good in boxers as well. I thought the 2.5 hour film would drag a bit. But it flew by. Too bad James Stalin was not in it. Guess he's too busy writing his books (Hollywood Lesbos: Who Screwed Who is his latest). I had not been in a theater for years. It was well worth the wait. An amazing film that will break every BO record in existence. Congrats to all!", "Best of the trilogy": "Let's talk about the good things first: I think this movie is the best of the spiderman MCU trilogy not just because of the nostalgia but first because how they explained \"why\" the spiderman story is a little bit different like not mentioning uncle Ben in the previous 2 movies because that was weird for me knowing that he is important for spiderman. Showing us cleary that they intentionally did not mention Ben because this is an alternative universe where Spiderman is inspired by Tony and May not Ben is really nice touch to the movie. Because in the previous 2 movies I thought that they didn't mention him because it was redundant and we know about his story . And I liked that they brought back \"with great power comes great responsibility but this time May says emphasize that she is Peter's inspiration not Ben so I don't have to think about where is Ben anymore . Second, bringing us the \"Friendly neighborhood spiderman in the end of the movie instead of a spiderman with Tony's techs. Third, I think this movie is the foundation of the future MCU like Iron man was to the infinity saga and I think there is a possibility for X men coming to the MCU since we have multiverse now. Fourth, come on seeing Andrew and Tobey in the same move gives the movie 7/10 by default lol.But nothing is perfect. There are few things that not necessarily ruined the experience but I have to mention them. First, I didn't like how Peter defeated Dr. Strange specially that the fight was in the mirror dimension in my opinion this was a bad fight seen. Second, how on earth Ned was able to do portals even though there was no hint before that he is good in doing magic. I think this was bad writing. Third, making all villains like patients and they have to be treated to become good really undermined their back story in the previous movie plus it doesn't make sense. Ok I agree that Doc ock needed treatment but I totally disagree that taking electro's powers will make him a good person. In my opinion he was bad from the start and when he gained power he just expressed that. Last, I hated what they did to venom I was so excited for Tom Hardy is joining the MCU but no the pulled him immediately. I'm hoping that they do with venom like what they did with J. Jonah Jameson when the made a new J. Jonah Jameson with the same actor put totally different person in the alternative universe.", "Spider man no way home": "It is the best movie of spider man. It should eatched in theatres in 3d it was an awesome experience .With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, our friendly neighborhood web-slinger is unmasked and no longer able to separate his normal life as Peter Parker from the high stakes of being a superhero.

I enjoyed every part but leaving the movie I questioned everything about it but it was still amazing. I laughed I cried.", "Peter Parker's journey from being the kid who's Spider-Man to the Man who's Spider-Man": "At the very beginning, I must say that I loved the movie although there were some points that worried me with every leak. The movie starts directly after FFH events when Mysterio reveals Peter's identity. What I liked about the movie is:\n1. The motives: I liked how Peter chooses to cure the villains first before sending them to their timelines unlike Strange (The thing that makes him the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man).2. I like how Strange himself still trying to treat Peter as a man (Don't call me sir scene, and then telling him to call sir when he messed up the spell).3. I like that Peter is trying to do the good things despite the consequences he faced because of his choices (Going to Strange because he wanted his friends to get accepted in MIT, trying to cure the villains, choosing to let people forget him for the spell to work well).4. I loved Tobey and Garfield guest of honors appearance and although people were very excited for their appearance, but Holland remained the star of the movie, the main Spider-Man to concentrate with, feel pity for him.5. The action sequence was spectacular specially the fight between Strange and Peter, 1st fight between Goblin and Peter and their last fight.6. Giacchino's score was was excellent.7. Cinematography was amazing.8. Acting was very great specially Holland, Molina, Cumberbatch, DAFOE, and Tomei.Now let's discuss the bad things that weren't much:1. Why did Sandman and Lizard join Electro and Goblin in their last fight? (We knew Electro's motives earlier).At the end, The movie was perfect, it had nostalgia that didn't affect the main movie or it's hero.Now we should wait for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (which is the post-credit scene)I hope you like and enjoy it as I did.", "Very good": "Tasty but not enough, the actors are all great and charismatic except for Parker's friends, the chemistry between the actors is top notch, in this film Marvel was able to show all the characters in full, each of their dialogue was interesting to listen to, everyone has a normal amount of time on the screen.

Baffles me these films are really dumb all marvel films are I belive they use humour to disguise the fact they have no story its the marvel formula you put all the mcu movies on 20 TV's and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference they're all the same everyone's a comedian.", "Childish": "So let me get this straight - people didn't like spider-man 3 because there were too many villains , but this one is the best because there are too many villains?!?

But People are so blinded by childhood nostalgia to overlook so many obvious flaws. The first half of the film was so rushed to force Tobey and Andrew into the film, the fact that Ned of all people created a gateway between dimensions is ridiculous and way too overlooked. The humour is also so misplaced in this and forced. It's trying to hard to be serious yet corny at the same time. I see people saying it's better than the dark knight and it's just not comparable.

Willem Dafoe is brilliant as the Green Goblin. Andrew Garfield proved once again, that he is amazing. Tom Holland was exceptional as well. Seeing all 3 Spider-Men was the best thing to ever happen to my life. The pure joy and excitement I felt, was overwhelming. I loved every second of this movie. Tom's Spider-Man truly proved himself.

Please tell me that's the trilogy done and he is gone?", "All hyped up, not upto the mark": "As someone who grew up watching SpiderMan the real first one and seeing this movie, it's just feels like a rushed up one for making sure the multiverse comes into play and other heroes and jump right into the Marvel Cash grab. This movie is just a hot mess . The flow is just bad, like seriously, a movie has 3 parts like food appetizer, main course and dessert simple. But if your food is a bit too sour, bitter and sweet and it's not balanced out you wouldn't like the whole experience. This was such a lame excuse to introduce the Multiverse and make way for other movies. This wasn't well tailored for me.", "The absolute WORST Spiderman yet...": "I don't get it... did other people watch the same film? Perhaps they actually don't care about Spiderman and WHO he is. But yay! In this film we get to see him SPLIT PERSONALITIES... and WOW what a TRAINWRECK DISNEY created. Don't they know all they have to do is FOLLOW THE COMICS??? And why was this thing so SAD???

So glad I pirated this and wasted zero pence. Avoid.", "Actually sucks": "This movie relied on nothing but cheap Hollywood action and nostalgia. The set up is weak and the rest of the plot is bad humor, fight scenes, and old characters showing up and fighting for no reason at all. Don't understand how the ratings are so high.", "Something for the kids": "Further proof that the writers at Marvel are running out of original ideas, and stuffing these movies with cliched dialogue and action set-pieces that we've seen many times before. The first 40 mins drag... it's badly scripted and paced, and can only appeal to children with short attention spans. The acting by the main stars (Even Benedict, yes) is below par and lines delivered with the enthusiasm of an audit.But seriously, it does seem that Marvel can't make a stand-alone Spiderman movie without giving him other superheroes to help him out with the plot. He's a weak hero - there, i said it. His range is minimal and his \"teenage problems\" are fast becoming dated and irrelevant. Marvel are in decline and it's looking like they went \"too hard, too early\", with the Avengers.Ultimately, this is a kids' movie. Fans of Spiderman and Marvel will rush to defend this film, but make no mistake: this was a poor outing by Marvel. If you want to compare recent comic book hero movies then look no further than The Batman, then step back, take a deep breath and realise how bad this film is.", "The Best Marvel movie yet": "What can I say that is not yet been repeated, this movie is epic on every single scale The story is brilliant and the surprise keep coming , a must watch period.", "Good, but flawed (and overhyped)": "First of all, this film is entertaining, has lots of awesome action sequences and great CGI.But what annoyed me the most was that none of the villains could live up to their original character in their original films at all because there was simply no time to go any deeper. They only served as plain villains without depth. I very much disliked the concept that curing them is the solution and here's why:Let's start with Lizard: Though I didn't really like the film he originated from (\"The Amazing Spider-Man\"), his actions were reasonable. You were able to understand his motives (in general: become a lizard to grow his missing arm) which drove him mad. In \"No Way Home\" he is useless, not interesting at all (because none of his original character arc is thematized) and completely unnecessary as he is not a real threat, just annoying! He can not be cured by taking away the lizard inside him because for him, it's not a disease in the first place.So next one is Sandman: His criminal actions were also totally reasonable as he needed money for his sick daughter. While doing so, he accidentally shot Peter's uncle Ben. In the end, Peter and him settled their conflict because it turns out Sandman is not a bad guy, just a desperate one. They ended up not being enemies anymore. So his character arc is perfectly completed in \"Spider-Man 3\". Thus there is absolutely no reason for him to return to \"No Way Home\" as a villain! I remember the heartbreaking scene when Sandman first tried to emerge from the sand after the transformation and needed several trials to rise and grab the necklace with a picture of his daughter inside... \"No Way Home\" completely destroys this character built in \"Spider-Man 3\". But the concept of curing would fit to Flint as he never wanted to become a Sandman in the first place. Still, he didn't necessarily need a cure, as he reconciled with himself in \"Spider-Man 3\".Next up is Electro from \"the Amazing Spider-Man 2\": Max is one of the most tragic villains in Spider-Man movies so far. He is a brilliant man, but noone acknowledges him for anything. You could empathize with him and understand his anger. With his powers he could channel his rage and finally be seen by the world. Given the fact that in \"No Way Home\" he and the other villains were teleported to Tom Holland's universe just before their death, let's look at Electro in that blink of the moment: He was totally insane and about to become the biggest threat in Andrew's universe. Once he arrived in Tom's universe, he was a completely different person, rather sane and totally clear in mind. He was Jamie Foxx, not Electro. Real Electro would've never let anyone touch his powers.Ok let's talk about Doc Ock from \"Spider-Man 2\". Great villain with a big dream gone wrong. His character arc is also perfectly completed in his original film. In the end, he even sacrifices himself after regaining control of his machine to prevent any more damage. In \"No Way Home\", he was rather presented as a joke to force laughs. Very sad. But at least in his case, the concept of curing works perfectly, as it is something technical and Otto of course never wanted to lose control.Last up is Green Goblin from \"Spider-Man\": In my opinion, this character stays true to his original personality. And he is the only one out of all the villains that was taken seriously in \"No Way Home\" as a threat that he is. But it is very questionable whether or not his psychosis can be cured by an injection?Anyway, the dynamics and dialogues all around and between the villains were all just jokes and patters. Just fan service - big lack of depth.What I'm also not convinced of is the concept of wanting to always save everyone. It has always been the biggest motivation of any Spider-Man to try save everyone around him, even the villains. Thus, understanding that sometimes, it is simply not possible, is one of the hardest things to accept, but it gives you the strength to grow and make hard decisions. Tobey couldn't save Norman Osborn, he grew so insane that he basically destroyed himself. Andrew had to kill Electro in order to save everyone else. And Tom actually experienced it too as he couldn't save Mysterio.Though I have to say that Tom's naivity and childishness in the first half of the film really annoyed me as it seems like he hasn't grown a bit in the last 2 films. At least since he had to kill Mysterio (and let's not forget what he experienced in Infinity War and Endgame) he should've become more responsible. Tobey found that out in his very first film when he lost his uncle Ben and had to deal with it. Andrew reached that point in his second film when he lost Gwen and Tom got a reset in his third film, which is somewhat exhausting to watch.But I still ask myself one thing: I don't know how exactly the spell works, but wouldn't it have been possible to erase Mysterio and what he said from everyone's mind instead?", "This movie filled me with love and took all my tears": "This movie is absolutely beautiful, the storyline, the characters, the acting, the cinematography, the cast everything about this movie is amazing. Seeing this movie was such an emotional experience. I'm a big marvel fan and have been waiting for this movie for a long time, so finally seeing it was amazing, but also so emotional. This movie is absolutely insane, it gave me laughter, tears and it made me feel so many things. This movie is incredibly insane and I've never seen anything like it. The storyline is insane the cast is insane. This movie is freaking crazy dude.", "What a nostalgia mess": "After I've finished watching the movie, I tried hard to understand, what is this hype all about?MU is getting increasingly bland and worse, since the End game and the direction it's taking to make itself too serious, while at the same throws washed out style of humor everywhere, is becoming tiresome.First... The entry, the beginning was one of the worst I seen in an movie for longest time.The attempt to build up the atmosphere was forceful and draggy, to a point It was itching to forward the entire interlude.And the speed the plot built to a point where it managed to somewhat finally shape into something solid was agonizing.I won't talk about CGI effects or action scenes, that's defacto for MU movies and starting to think, the whole sale point lately.But good lord was the core of plot messy, dull and uninspiring piece of work. Who writes this scripts?The only reason why this is not lower is the ace they pulled and brought into the movie some redemption in form of what all previous movies have done better... And with it some essence.But even that was spoiled with blamesy of stupid jokes. Seriously, if you are going to continue this, you need to change the way you crack jokes and stop doing it in every single situation with exception where you remove permanently someone from MU movie universe.Essentially this was clumsy done hard reboot to change what they done in previous movies and stir more towards the Amazing Spiderman...I am really disappointed with execution and bewildered at positive reactions to this movie, when this would be butchering at the scale of what Hobbit movies have done to source material...", "I Admire The Decision To Assimilate \"Memory\" with Big Mantra \"With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibilities\" & \" Second Chance\"": "Just finished watching & It's strange to see Spider-man: No Way Home, for all the spectacles & conversations and the buzz surrounding the superhero world, is a movie about......MEMORYMemories can evoke a whole host of feelings, including joy, pleasure, fear or grief.Our memories serve a function as a \"tool\" to ignite our \"emotional core\" upon forced recall of specific events.With that's being said, Our memory helps us remember past experiences, previous learned facts, habit and skills. Memory is comparable to but distinct from learning in which is the process by which we acquire knowledge of the world. Our learning process and how we become someone we are today in life depends on how we \"manage\" our memory. We can use it to make ourselves better,...or worse.The events in No Way Home are started with Peter Parker tries to erase other people's memory about him. An effort that leads to big consequences & great responsibilities.Villains become villains triggered by their memories. Other Spider-Men become wiser because they've been learning so much from their memories.In film, Eternal Sunset of the Spotless Minds, Dr. Howard Mierzwaik uses a procedure called\n\"reconsolidation\" to eliminate or destroy the memory, preventing it from future recall. But what happens next? People loses their identity, their \"emotional core\". What at first is seen as the most logical way to reinvent one's self, losing memory is the cause of bigger catastrophe.The term \"second chance\" in No Way Home means trying to be better persons by embracing memories: mistakes and other things we've been through in the past. I admire the decision from the screenwriters to assimilate \"second chance\" with memory and how we should not erase the memory, but rather to deal and to manage it for something better. No Way Home also manages to reconcile the DNA of this franchise by continuing the mantra spelled by Sam Raimi, \"With great power, comes great responsibilities\" & uses \"memory\" to cement that.With great power and the ability to manage our memory, we can bear the brunt of great responsibilities.Our memories of people close to us; our memories of people that are meaningful to us, shaping our identity, to become the better version of ourselves.Peter might ask Doctor Strange to eradicate the most painful events in his life in order to move on. But no, he lives with the memories of people he loves the most. To start a new life, embracing his memories to be better.No Way Home underlines what we love about the grounded and friendly neighborhood superhero.It doesn't matter what other people's memory about him; he doesn't need to be remembered as big hero. What really matters to him is the memory of people he loves about him.Ooh what a way to use memory to start the new chapter of another trilogy (I assume) of Spider-Man.", "Thank god the ratings are good": "Never thought after ending the MCU Would still be amazing but it's getting better and better what a story what a movie loved every second in the cinema.", "Just crazy stuff in this movie! you will be surprised alot of time in a good way": "This movie is crazy in big ways, and i will not spoil it for you, but it is very good!Crazy stuff all around to the end, and you will be speechless in the end.One of the best movie out there.Thanks.", "They pulled it off!": "This movie was truly everything it could've possibly been.

It was \"amazing\" to have a series that started 20 years ago pay off so well in continuity.'Nuff said!", "Dream Come True": "This movie was a dream come true. Matt Murdock returning. Garfield and Maguire. All the other villains. I would do anything to go back and re watch this for the first time. Amazing acting! Perfect balance of comedy and emotion.", "A Cinematic Melting-Pot!": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is equal parts reinvention and newfound territory to take one of the world's most beloved characters in surprisingly creative directions. If Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse didn't bring home the idea of multiverses for the web-slinger in a broader sense for casuals, No Way Home consolidates the concept in the MCU thanks to its many 'legacy-surprises'.No Way Home is the culmination of EVERY live-action Spider-Man movie before it, and wraps it all up with a nice if somewhat overwhelming bow of affection. It's clear that Jon Watts not only wanted to fulfil his desire to make the proverbial Spider-Man story for cinema (alongside Spider-Verse), but also show that fan-service can serve emotionally potent stories; when done right fan service is a dramatic double-whammy of visceral effect instead of empty pandering.Spider-Man's probably one of cinema's most reinvented characters ever; and this film is the newest in a long line of interpretations that won't leave us anytime soon. But how can they top this? Where to go after the Sam Raimi and Marc Webb films crossing over with the MCU? I don't know; they can try, but this will be that 'special first' for the MCU to cross with other film canons.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a pay-off that feels earnest and well-deserved for any devout Spider-Fan out there, and for sure one of 2021's biggest cinematic bangs.The new (and MUCH improved) Spider-Man 3 gets 5/5 stars.", "WOW": "What an absolute masterpiece \ud83d\udc4f 10/10.The nostalgia in this film is a childhood dream a definite must see with countless rewatch ability!First time in a long time I've heard a cinema clap at the end of a film...", "Just Amazing!!!": "The movie definitely lived up to the hype, without a doubt the best movie this year!!This movie will captivate you from the start with the introduction of key characters to the amazing CGI and fight scenes. It is definitely worth the money. I could watch this a thousand times and would still cheer very loud!", "Spidermen through the years": "As always I liked it from the beginning as this is a spider man movie; then after a while it became fantastic when all 3 of them came to work on the same screen.There was nothing one can find fault about it.Loved it with my whole spidey heart.", "\"I love you guys!\"": "There you go, Marvel, it's possible! After \"Avengers Endgame\" the quality of most MCU films was extremely disappointing in my eyes. Neither films nor series could really convince me. But my last hope rested on the third and (for now?) last \"Spider-Man\" film with Tom Holland. And who would have thought it, but \"No Way Home\" (2021) made it! The film refreshed the MCU and in my opinion is the best thing Marvel has done in a long time in so many ways. But where do you start with this film? Difficult, because it's hard to tell anything about the story without spoilers, so I'll go into spoilers later, but of course point them out first.Peter's identity was revealed by Mysterio and now he has to live with the consequences. His personal life is over, but so are his friends MJ and Ned. And if that wasn't enough, many people believe that Peter killed Mysterio. Spidey sees no alternative but to seek out Doctor Strange. Because he might have a solution for his problem...It's almost impossible to go into the film without any prior knowledge, because the trailers alone tell you very clearly what to expect. But of course they don't reveal everything, which I at least welcome. Still, I recommend anyone who hasn't seen the trailer (if thats even an option for anyone) to avoid it and go into the movie as fresh as possible.\"No Way Home\" is the third film in this still quite young trilogy, which actually doesn't really work without the \"Avengers\" films (and many other individual films from the MCU), but you can say that we all have a real, complete Spider-Man series for the first time. Both the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield films ended quite openly. And while Tom Holland will certainly continue, this film is a kind of conclusion for the Avengers-Spidey.The story in this film takes on unexpected dimensions and for a long time I had the feeling that there were real stakes. I noticed that especially with the action. A lot of Marvel movies have those clearly defined action moments that are meant to look cool and epic (so you can put them into the trailers), but here the Peter Parker story came first. Each scene seemed like a natural progression from the one before, and I really liked that. I also think it's great that Tom Holland's character has to face the biggest challenges since Thanos. It's his film and his story. And it has never been as good as it is here. Holland is a great actor who has been fantastic as Spider-Man so far, but it's only here that I think he really matures into a character. The rest of the cast is great too, I really like Zendaya and Jacob Batalon in this film and they also develop into fleshed out characters.But that's not all: The action and the visuals of the film have improved. While technically good, the first two Spidey films were never as impressive as Sam Raimi's trio. Here, however, some people seem to have really thought about it. \"No Way Home\" is visually very impressive, wild and at times beautiful. Michael Giacchino (again) does a great job with his score and lets the Spidey theme sound really powerful with a few moments of goosebumps.The film isn't quite perfect, as many logic gaps are opened up in order to advance the story. BUT: That never bothered me because the fun, the emotions and the huge surprises were more than worth it. A movie has to entertain me and \"No Way Home\" did that every second. And that's exactly why I forgive the film's small weaknesses. Also, in an MCU film with magic and spider powers, you have to accept some supernatural and crazy things.But from here I have to enter spoiler territory. So if you haven't seen the film yet, you should NOT read on and jump to the conclusion. Here's your warning, so go ahead!SPOILER Alert!It was clear from the trailers that there would be an overlap with the previous Spidey universes. But even before that, there was speculation, fantasizing and there were first leaks. I think that's why everyone wanted to see this film. But despite all the fantastic appearances, \"No Way Home\" is still a film that not only does (great) fan service, but creates a new story with old characters. Especially the villains from the Raimi and Marc Webb universe refresh the whole thing nicely. Alfred Molina as Doc Ock and Willem Dafoe as Osborne are the stars here, but Jamie Foxx as Electro also gets a new take on his character. Sandman and the Lizard are there and the actors (Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans) give their voice for them, but the ending shots with the actors were (unfortunately) used from earlier films. At least we get to enjoy J. K. Simmons again as J. Jonah Jameson. This time he is a paranoid maniac who spreads consiracy theories, but it works.In addition, the idea that all villains should be healed is really great. No typical good versus evil, but Holland's Peter Parker wants to give these antagonists a new chance. At the same time, however, he is also struggling with the consequences of his leaked identity.But what would this film be without the appearances of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield? How much I wished for that and it came true. And both aren't just simple cameos, they both have integral roles in the story. And this is where the magic of the film comes into play. Something like this will probably never happen again, it's unique. And I never thought that Marvel could make me feel this overflowing enthusiasm again, like last time in \"Endgame\". Seeing Tobey Maguire again as Spider-Man was magical. And Garfield gets to save MJ in free fall, bringing some closure to his trauma with Gwen. Absolutely fantastic!The question is, of course, is it possible to see and enjoy the film without the Maguire and Garfield films? Yes. But of course the effect without these films isn't even remotely as great. And honestly, what Spidey fan hasn't seen the other movies? There's even a small, funny reference to Miles Moralis.SPOILERS end!Conclusion: What a movie. What a Spider-Man movie. \"No Way Home\" was the most fun I had in the cinema since \"Endgame\". Marvel still has this magical potential somehow and director Jon Watts got almost everything out of this story. An absolute festival that entertained and touched me like hardly anything else in 2021!", "WOW!!!!": "The best spider man movie in all time. I swear to have a sequel. The cinema hall explode when Adrew Garfield comes but when Tobey Maguire comes i cant hear the movie all the peoples screaming exciting. Everyone should watch it. Perfect acting from Tom Holland,Andrew,Tobey,Willem Dafoe,Molina. In this movie have a little and a big from everyrhing tears,happiest,exiting. The scene when Andrew save MJ...... it's perfect for me. Everyone want The Amazing Spider-Man 3 and to come back Gwen it will be interesting to see what can do after 8 years. #MakeTASM.", "Loved it!!": "I really am an optimist.. and always find something good in every movie I see.But honestly this movie made me feel a range of emotions.. all good..\nThey managed to redeem every character. And bring such a nice closure for everyone. (I'm trying not to get into details).The point is this is the best Spider Man ever!!!So worth it!!Honestly, Marvel is doing a great job with our heroes!!So beautiful! So emotional! So funny!So good!", "A marvel by Marvel": "Immensely enjoyed this marvelous movie by Marvel with special thanks to NSW government's Discover NSW voucher. Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), what a stunt and what a show that suits people of all ages. It is so visually striking, synoptically intriguing and emotionally attaching.Visual effects of its action genre are vividly expressed in various fights and stunts throughout this movie. Intriguing synopsis includes but is not limited to the unfolding of the spell and the multiple layers of the portals. Needless to say the emotional discharge reaches a new high when Peter Parker says goodbye to his dying aunt May and much loved girlfriend for the sake of public good.Cast and crew are always a much anticipated aspect of any Marvel movie. This cast is particularly strong, full of A-listers. Tom Holland, Jamie Foxx, Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire. It is particularly surprising (in a good way) to see the reappearance of three Spider-Men, past and present, as well as precedent and current villains. It is such a heartwarming reunion of the Spider-Man family. I honestly love all three Spider-Man actors. Holland has such a cute teenager face despite being in his mid-20s. He just doesn't look his age. Zendaya is a pretty woman too. Besides the chubby boy Jacob Batalon is lovable. All three teenage characters really express their teenage traits at a maximum.The filming location is also a sensation. New York, an alpha city in this globe, stands out so well. It undoubtedly invoked the memory of my 2015 trip to this city. Well I guess most people get to know New York from movies due to its many world class landmarks.Well done Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021). You truly deserve many accolades. I am sure you will fare well in your numerous sequels. Bring it on!", "Astonishing! Best spiderman so far": "This movie has everything! It's packed with action from start to finish, funny as hell, great visual effects and a few surprises with some unexpected appearances. Watch it on the big screen, you won't regret it!", "The trio makes its even better": "Yes, brining past characters made this movie epic. The spider man meme came real point each other, that was hilarious. The concept of multiverse just opens up the whole new storytelling in the MCU.", "I DONT KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN": "This movie is all I ever wanted in a Spider-Man movie! I've been thinking so much about I really enjoyed this A LOT more than the previous two Avengers movie. This movie does not use nostalgia as bait and that's great because it works really well with the narrative. Highly Recommend and safely return to theaters!", "Some truly inspired bits": "Parts are sappy (the soundtrack is the worst) but the script is well above average for the genre. It's not \"Black Panther\" but it's far better than most. Tom Holland is and will probably always be the best Spiderman, but it was a fantastic idea to bring all 3 of them together and the multiple-Spiderman bits were the best parts of the movie.", "SPIDER-MAN:NO WAY HOME-SPOILERS": "I went into this film expecting it to just be the best spider-man film, well little did I know that it would end up becoming my most favourite marvel film of all time,and seeing Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield on screen again along with the previous villains from their movies just blew my mind....also one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had.", "A closure for many stories": "This is a wonderful film which feels true to the spirit of the comics and the character.

But i have to try and be subjective so I won't rate this as a sam raimi trilogy fan but as a normal movie goer.Plot 8/10: good, fast paced and straightforward. But no masterpiece.Acting 8/10: pretty good performances by all sides, but nothing oscar worthyCinematography 7,5: some standout moments (peter realizes green goblin took over), but nothing too impressiveSoundtrack 8,5: this is where i can't be objective. Great soundtrack with the right amount of nostalgia and own personalityOverall: 8,5/10\nGreat Movie for non spiderman fans but an absolute must see for every spidey fan. Can't describe the experience, you have to go out and see it.", "A massive step up for Marvel": "I watched No Way Home about a week ago now, enough time for it to ferment in my mind. Usually my opinion on a film will change over the following days proceeding my original viewing, In the case of No Way Home my feelings towards the film have remained largely the same since I stepped out of the screening.My expectations were high, very high. Did it live up to these expectations? Yes, I think it did, a remarkable accomplishment. Overall, I had a great time here, a really great time in fact. Let's be honest, it was predictable, messy and even contrived at points. But looking from a purely \"entertaining\" standpoint, No Way Home achieves what it sets out to do tremendously.As mentioned, there are plenty of flaws, you could nit-pick for days. The film suffers from mild pacing issues around the beginning and particularly irritating plot points powered by infuriatingly stupid character moments. An obvious example can be found with Doctor Strange, which, without going off to much on a tangent, is by far the worst character in the film. His dialogue is repeatedly cringe inducing and he is just plain idiotic. Why wouldn't he discuss anything about the spell with Peter beforehand? It's almost as if all of his actions are purely to propel the plot.A problem I have with almost all Marvel films is their lack of identity, their lack of artistic integrity and mind-numbingly boring aesthetic. To me, for a long time now, they have simply felt like factory films. Acting as a cash cow to be milked at least twice a year. No Way Home succeeds by breaking away from this mould. This is largely thanks to its creative cinematography and directing in many scenes, the action specifically is shot exceptionally well which helps massively to enhance the movement of Spider Man and the power of attacks being hurled back at force between the characters.One slight flaw I found to be noticeable was the varied quality of performances. For the most part they were very good, Tom Holland really got a chance to show off his talent and Dafoe steals the show as he usually does. But I wasn't really that impressed with Jamie Foxx and I really wish they gave Tobey a lot more to do here. He'll always be my favourite representation of Spider Man however he was being noticeably overshadowed by Andrew Garfield.Apart from a few rather minor details in the grand scheme of things, I really enjoyed my time with No Way Home. I hope this acts as a stepping stone for Marvel because this was a very promising improvement so they best not throw it away.", "Lovely": "This is the best Spiderman ever! I loved every scene of this amazing film. It's funny, exciting, amazing and yet profound. And you will be surprised after the first 30 minutes....a true gift (but also a great marketing choice) for all the Spiderman lovers.", "What can I say? Absloutly fantastic": "I can't say much about it because I can't describe the joy that I had in this film. I watched to the film 4 times so far.

Longtime fans especially.I think it's going to be special for them and I think that's really good.As someone who has seen a couple of the movies I still think this was a sweet movie.I think it's paced well, some of the acting is great and it is engaging.My main issue is that messaging and basically the conflict of the movie. It is a disaster for me. It seems like \"I should do this because if I don't we won't have a movie\" sort of motivation. I think if they had just polished it up a tiny bit I would have been more onside.The underlying issue for me is that Tom Holland's Spider-Man is such an insufferable brat. He is so spoilt and unlikable for me. Looking at the other two Spider-Man characters from past movies, this character is just so annoying.Apart from them small issues I think this was a great movie. Definitely a must watch for fans.", "The ultimate Spider-Man movie!!": "This movie is everything you could possibly fantasize and then more. Absolutely brilliant, this is easily the best Spider-Man movie ever made, and maybe this is nostalgia talking but possibly the best marvel movie ever!", "Best Spider-Man we've gotten so far": "Rating: 8.2This was the spiderman to end all spider men. Looked incredible, and was as sensibly written as you can get when it comes to multiverse media. The stakes were high (aunt may dies), the pacing was fast, the humor wasn't forced, the callbacks to prior spiderman films were clean, and most of all: the ending wasn't a copout everyone forgot peter parker; a fitting consequence to peter trying to \"have it all\". I didn't like how Strange caved to peters requests when he first cast the spell then blamed peter for the fallout when he could've just not added the extra parameters. But the plot needed that catalyst to start the drama. The dialogue between the spidermen was everything you could've hoped for. Excellent watch.", "Orgasmic": "You take awesome Marvel magic, meme references, spectacular baddies, and throw in laughs, emotion, and feelings of euphoria. Once you have all that in place you are can share my Orgasmic Valhalla. I totally understand why my son has seen this film in theatres four times. This one now ranks as my top Marvel fav.", "amazing movie": "Superhero extravaganza! Spider-Man NWH didn't meet my expectations, it exceeded them. The most emotionally resonant MCU film so far. This movie is worth every excruciating moment we had to wait. The visuals, the score, the emotions, the story, and ofc the fan-service. This film understands spider-man fans like no other spider-man film before it. Truly a celebration of the most beloved character in the best way possible!", "The best movie": "It's the best movie of 2021, one of the best history movies and superhero movies, if not the best. Thank you, Marvel, and we're excited for the upcoming movies.", "This is NOT a 9 or a 10!": "This movie takes a LONG time to get going. I could sum up the first hour in 2 sentences...they should have cut an hour out because it was kind of boring in the beginning...I watched too many reviews before seeing it saying this was a 9 or a 10...this WAS NOT a 9 or 10...so I highly recommend going into the movie was NO expectations.... I was also told there would be NO WOKENESS, well, they were WRONG! There was probably 10 or so wokeness moments in the movie, so that was a HUGE disappointment as well.Its an OK movie at best.My favorite Spiderman movie is still Spider-Man 2 in 2004....now that is a 10!6/10 Just so-so, The WOKENESS ruined some of the movie...", "I've always been more of a DC guy, but this one made me think": "Movie that nicely wraps up the Spider-Man trilogy and Spider-Man as a whole. After leaving the movie, I could almost feel the sadness of an era being over, you just fell that blues when a beloved franchise makes its final repose. Tom Holland was fantastic in particular in this movie without spoiling everything. Having said that, everytime I feel this way about a famous franchise ending, I think to myself, and this lightens me up, what is next?", "THE MOST AMBITIOUS MCU FILM": "Unbiased Review of Spider-Man: No Way Home\nUndoubtedly Marvel Studios' most ambitious movie yet (yes more ambitious than Avengers: Infinity War or Avengers: Endgame), Spider-Man: No Way Home is just amazing. It beautifully and logically connects three eras of Spider-Man movies into one complete package of surprises, action, thrill and the most important of them -emotion. The dialogues are very properly crafted to bring as sense of continuity from the three eras of Spider-Man movies. The top cast of the movie have really lived up to their fame and made the movie come to life with their splendid acting skills and their hard-work. The CGI and VFX of this movie are more than what a Marvel fan desires. The job of completing this incredibly ambitious project was indeed a difficult task and since the film-makers are humans after all so plot-holes were inevitable. Overall, this movie is like heavenly manna for those who were in the hunger for the best Spider-Man movie.Features of this film:-\nActing- 5/5\nAction- 4/5\nBackground Music- 4/5\nLogic- 3/5\nSurprises- 8/5\nEmotion- 5/5\nPlot- 3/5Further in-depth analysis:-\nComing to the purpose of the movie which makes it what fans call 'epic', 'blockbuster', 'masterpiece', 'thunderbuster', etc.Spider-Man: No Way Home was the medium by which Marvel and Sony not only corrected the mistakes of Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man and Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man in their respective universes but also did justice to Tom Holland's Spider-Man's character arc.From the time of Tom Holland's Spider-Man's debut he had been living in the shadow of others which did not make him realise his own true potential. To be frank, I did not even feel like he was Spider-Man because the main-point of being Spider-Man (besides having spider-powers) was to have personal problems and keeping your identity secret even from your colleagues and not be dependent on someone else which Tom's Spider-Man constantly failed to do.It's a pleasure to see Marvel and Sony trying to correct their mistakes and making Tom's Spider-Man realise that his days of staying in others shadows are gone. It is time for him to start from zero and stand on his own feet because \"with great power comes great responsibilities.\"", "The Spider Man movie you've been wanting": "I never really hated Tom Hollands Spider Man, but he was not my favorite compared to the others. But this is my favorite Tom Holland Spider Man film.Takes place after the events of last film, where Peter Parker/Spider Man(Tom Holland) is exposed to the world, and his life and friends are in shambles, so Peter turns to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) in hopes he can create a spell in hopes the world will forget he's Spider Man, but it goes awry, and what comes next, will be a spoiler I don't want to give away.Tom Holland really shows more acting chops in the film, then he did in the last two. Effects are great, and battle scenes are epic. I'm not saying it's a perfect film, but in some moments it does things a little better then the other Spider Man films. The other cast are great also.", "Love this!": "The best Spiderman for me. My friends love this too. Watch this in Cinema and very happy watching it. :)\nThis exceed my expectations. Thank you for this movie.", "Absolutely AMAZING!!!!!!": "The words to describe this movie will not do it Justice, but here it goes. Best Marvel film to date! It was an incredible film that touched on so many AMAZING things and will bring great joy to generations. An absolute gem! Thank you Into the Spider-verse! This is a movie for the ages. Stop what you're doing and go see it now!", "Question is... can Disney/Marvel top it or have an equal?": "Your thoughts. Can't reply on it on here. But think about it. Where there is pandemic finially sustainable and a bunch of of us having to rewatch what we love with decent content. Then go watch other things. Think it changed the dynamic. Still hold true to what the past marvel phases were. Still some great stuff.", "Here are the facts": "1. It kept me completely engaged for 2.5 hours. I don't remember thinking about anything else but the movie for that long. It was truly immersive experience -- without the power of \"technology\" but just with plots and characters, which is what all cinema should strive for.2. This was possibly the best plot ideation to connect multiple reboots into one cohesive movie. Nothing felt forced or questionable.3. While it is not a flawless movie, those flaws are so minuscule that it hardly matters and I've never expected another MCU movie would be as good as Endgame or almost better than it.4. This was the best fan service movie they could do for Spiderman fans. What a phenomenal addition to the franchise.", "Fan Tribute": "The most anticipated film of 2021 is Spider-Man: No Way Home.The internet was inundated with leaked footage and fan speculations leading up to the release of the film.Every show time was sold out within two days of the first booking date, demonstrating how much people are invested in the red-blue suited jumping character, and boy did it live up to the expectations, exceeding all expectations.In each paragraph, I shall go over every key section of a film.Acting: Everyone did their best, albeit there are a few characters (the sand man, the lizard, and the happy) whose performances are unimportant because they are only in the movie to increase the anticipation.William Defoe produced an enthralling performance, and Tom Holland finally gives us a mature Peter Parker, which I've been waiting for since the first installment of the Home trilogy.Cinematography: It looks almost identical to every other Marvel picture, but a number of critical scenes are shot at night, which is unusual in the MCU.Camera Work: This section could have been better; it's not horrible, but there aren't any jaw-dropping visuals or movement, and it's just okay.Direction: John Wyats did a nice job, but it felt like he made the first half for Marvel to aid the MCU with movies, and the second half for Sony to please the fans.MUSIC : Michael Giochhiono is very good with every scores.Story: The film has storyline flaws, and I'll only describe three of them here. First, despite the fact that they mentioned they did spells for the worst reasons such as forgetting parties, I still did not find Dr. Strange's action of assisting kids for college admission through reality warping magic convincing. It simply does not fit with Stephen the arrogant genius's characteristics.Second, Electro should not be in the film because he never knew Spider Man's identity, and third, I'm not sure how the forget spell works (small spoiler), and after seeing the film, I have a lot more concerns about it.None of this matters now that the second half has begun and our school spirit has returned. The climax was fantastic and moving.Overall, my friends and I kept clapping, expressing happiness, and shouting with famous characters entries, and at the finale, we were on the edge of our seats, not knowing what to expect next.We still can't believe what we've witnessed. This film is a gift to all enthusiasts of superheroes. The cinema's atmosphere was incredible. I never imagined the Avengers Endgame emotion could be recreated, but it did.Thank you so much to Marvel and Sony for bringing this film to life.The film contains shortcomings, but they must be overlooked because of Marvel Studios' aim. They're accomplishing something that would have been unimaginable ten years ago.JUST ENJOY THE MOVIE FROM THE HEART AND REFLECT ON A BEAUTIFUL MEMORY.", "Just the hype": "Im pretty sure all the top 250 movies are better than no way home. Im pretty sure im gonna get a lot of hate , but Awful movie. The plot sucked and had awful pacing humour, and dialogue were subpar(like the octopus joke). And they couldn't think of anything better so they brought back some old characters which still didn't save this poorly written film. One bad dialogue scene was when the 3 Spider-Men where making jokes about Tobey's organic webs which was just awkward and humourless. And to add to that, Tobey saying that \"my back\" joke and Norman Osborn repeating \"I'm something of a scientist myself\". Just why?! The film could never decide whether it's a comedy or a dark action movie.", "A lengthy and tedious movie": "I understand the business reasons to bring Toby and Andrew back, but some of the awkward conversations were so not necessary. A should-be 80-minute movie has been prolonged to 2 and a half hour a-waste-of-time freak show.", "Worst one, sadly.": "I thought I'll watch one if not the best Marvel creation, but it turned out to be the opposite.The amount of sillyness packed in this one.. It's just annoying.Let me highlight the biggest one.Each of the previous Spider-Man movies had atleast 1 antagonist that they had hard times with through a whole movie. And their goal was to stop them, not to \"cure\" them. They didn't had a clue of how or why they turned evil. Now suddenly, they all know these answers, they also know the exact solution of how to turn them back to be normal/good. And it doesn't even take a whole movie to not just to stop all of the former antagonists, but to cure them.The characters were shallow, the actors made me think I was watching actors and not characters.It was just all wrong. All the interesting parts were missing from the movie. Why he has to hide who he is? Why is it not clear for everyone that Spider-Man is the good guy? The conversation about the web and other differences? (Let me explain, in order to partially know these answers you must watch the previous movies, but the characters do not know anything about each other, many people doesn't know neither or they just don't remember and this is why they should have added these parts. To give the characters more character.)This is easily one of the worst Marvel movies. And I have no idea why would anyone think it was good.And there are more plotholes and problems than these. It was just the biggest of all.Lastly, I'd like to thank you all who paid to watch this movie, you're helping killing movies. In the very near future movies like The Godfather will not be made because it's not about sillyness and colorfull dresses. (Just see how much money a bad movie like this makes and how much money a good one makes.. Barely covers the costs. You're all Marvel's herd.)", "The spider bit the wrong guy": "This movie is the apotheosis of stupidity. Every character looks stupid. The acting look stupid and the gags they try to put on the screen do not make you laugh. At all. I can't believe American teenagers are so dumb. Not all at least, so definitely the spider bit the wrong teen. I really dislike this new wave of Spider-man movies. Painful to watch.", "speechless": "Wow, the excitement buliding up to this film was definitely worth it! Everything's perfect, they couldn't have done it better. It's been almost 3 hours since i've seen the film and i'm lost for words. What a masterpiece!", "Great film": "'No Way Home' is an example of how fanservice should be done for fans. All the villains are perfectly matched, the Goblin's stupid mask has been removed and he has acquired a more spectacular look. The story of Aunt May and Uncle Ben is done in a smart way, and here you really feel like doom. Does the doctor spoil all the raspberries with his uber abilities? No, for we do not know their limits, and we have to take his word for it.", "Worst Super Hero made": "I couldn't find one thing to like about it.Such a climatic ending and cliff hanger for Spider-Man Far From Home, and this starts out flat as an opened, left in the car for a week, diet no caffeine coke.I was in shock how pathetically written the movie started out, doing an \"okay, all is forgotten, you kids can get on with your life now.\" Sloppy, lazy, and insulting, even to the youngest of fans out there.Like a date promised to go to a nice restaurant, and they end up getting treated to that one hot dog at the gas station that has been on the back rotisserie for a day and half.As we get over the first absurd shock, the movie just keeps getting worse and worse, more ridiculous as the plot unfolds. Recycled parts, with a really bad appearance with Dr. Strange in it. Their tango together and how that was written is even more absurd than the story line itself. This obsession to defy rules without maturity, by this 3rd Spider-Man, was just too annoying to even come close to liking it. It must be part of the mental issues with kids out there now, \"I can fix it, and save the bad guys.\"So very anti-climatic from leaving off from \"Far From Home.\" Stale, horrible plot, worst script, and so very dull. I wonder if Samuel L. Jackson saw the original script, and was \"Ahhh hellNaw, I ain't doing this sh t.\"For the love of Christmas and all that is Holly and Jolly, get someone who can write, produce, and direct these movies. Let the fans have a go at, or the film students who would do it for room and food truck. They couldn't do any worse, I promise.", "The best Spider-Man Outing for Marvel": "The first 2 MCU Spider Man's were okay but No Way Home is easily the greatest outing yet. It's almost impossible for a movie like this to fail when the storyline is balls to the walls and so satisfying if you've watched every single Spider-Man live action movie yet.The performances are all solid, but it's Defoe who ends up stealing the show. His performance as the Goblin really is one of the greatest villain portrayals of all time. Also, Andrew Garfield deserved a better Spider Man franchise because his performance jumps off the screen in his limited screen time.While a lot of these reviews are overrating the movie, it's still great and well worth your time for a seriously fun and inventive concept.", "Mind-blowing": "The emotions on this Spiderman can not be described. For me Toby id the best Spiderman and seeing him on screen made cry a bit. Garfield was better than he was in his movies. The plot was pretty basic but they delivered so good. The only downside for me is the Ending. I am not a fan of memory erasing, cause it creates too many plot holes. I cant wait to see how the movies will go on now that Holland met actual Spider-Man.", "Teenage rubbish": "Absolutely disappointing... everything is just trash the actors the story line and especially the humour, the only thing that kept it interesting is the CGI and the affects. But I hate this trash teenage acting !!! They just state the obvious and talk really fast and it's meant to be some what funny, they even has the old Spider-Man do it..... it's very dumbed down and not for adults.

Not that impressive.": "I give this movie a solid 3 because of the time I wasted watching it vs my high expectations. It is the worst of all spiderman movies. Spiderman has moved from the greatest experience to a movie suitable for kids. There is totally nothing interesting about the movie.On the second thought;\nIf the spell brought back all the dead villans in time from the dead, then why didn't all the MJ's and uncle Ben's came back to life also?Like I said, it is only suitable for kids who can't analyze anything on their own.", "How did they exceed expectations?": "I haven't written a review before, but it's Sunday of opening weekend and I've already seen the movie twice. I have enjoyed the previous Tom Holland Spider-Man movies but I can't say I've outright loved them. They've been good for what they were trying to be, which is kind of an heir apparent to Iron Man.This movie isn't about the Avengers or Iron Man and I loved it. I can't believe that, with all the hype, they exceeded expectations. See this movie. There is action, of course. But what made the movie was the acting, the emotions. Even in many of the fight scenes, you could feel the emotion. And some of the best Spider-Man fighting we've seen to date.It's hard to review with no spoilers, but you won't be disappointed. See this movie, even if you've not loved Phase 4 movies up to this point. You'll be glad you did.", "Loved it": "Larger than life. Leeds and MJ find their Parker who is comforted by MJ, after learning of May's death. He then meets the other Spider-Men, who share their own stories of losing loved ones and encourage him to fight in May's honor.

As the three Spider-Men struggle, they decide to plan a coordinative attack on the villains.

I guess that explains everything. One of the few marvel movies that have like 5 villains in it , so you can say that this movie is special .", "Brings it all together": "Took my kids today to watch the movie. They've watched every Spider-Man movie and the three of us agreed that was the best Spider-Man movie made.

The first 2 installments were Homecoming & Far From Home. Zendaya returns as his girlfriend, MJ & Jacob is his best bud. This one starts just as Far From Home ended, with Mysterio revealing Tom's identity to the world. Tom gets the idea to talk to Benedict/Dr Strange about helping him with his problem. Benedict decides to try a spell that would make everyone forget Tom's alter ego but things go wrong-of course-and a doorway to multiple dimensions is opened with some unannounced visitors popping up. You have villains and heroes from different multiverses to contend with-no spoilers here on who they are-and if you are a comic fan like I am, you will not be disappointed. It has lots of humor along with the usual fisticuffs too. There are 2 scenes during the end credits, one just after they start and the other one at the very end so don't leave too soon.It's rated PG-13 for action, violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 28 minutes.I really enjoyed it and will definitely buy it on Blu_Ray.", "The best Spider-Man movie EVER!!!!": "First of all i should say what i thought that the movie was going to be and i thought that Andrew, Tobey and Tom wasn\u00b4t going to share the big screen so when i was on the cinema you should have an idea of my reaction hahahaAnd now about the movie: It was so damn good i loved every second and if a could describe it i would say \"a roller-coaster of emotions\" first you are like so worried about the situation of Tom Holland (Peter of the UCM) and after that when Dr Octopus appears it\u00b4s so mind-blowing that you can\u00b4t believe it it was so unreal after this you are watching when aunt May\u00b4s plan and it was kinda weird (at least for me) but i still like it and then aunt may dies it\u00b4s so unexpected (again at least for me) it was so sad a minutes later you watch Ned and MJ watching a spiderman and it\u00b4s so crazy so weird and so exciting and then he takes off his mask and it\u00b4s Andrew Garflied (Amazing Spiderman) and everything it\u00b4s so damn great i couldn\u00b4t be more happy at that moment and then Tobey (Spiderman original trilogy) appears it\u00b4s better and the last fight it\u00b4s so exciting when the 3 spidermans fight against all of the Supervillians of the first 5 movies it\u00b4s a dream come true i loved it and the finale of the movie it\u00b4s really so sad and i guess that it was the best choice and that\u00b4s it about the story of the movieNow about the characters im going to talk about the most important ones:Peter Parker 1 (Tom): When i saw the first two movies i liked it even thought he was funnier than the rest and more charismatic than the others two in this movie you watch him doing everything cry, laugh, fight, etc and i started to appreciate Tom as Spider-man and as an actor it was very great and i hope to keep watching a Tom Holland like this.Peter Parker 2 (Andrew): He appeared in the second half of the movie and he was okey even because he did the same of the other two movies but i already have respect for Andrew (for Hacksaw Ridge and Tik Tik Boom) and he is a great actor and i REALLY hope to see him again as Spiderman cause i think that he was undervalued and he can do more.Peter Parker 3 (Tobey): This guy was a god maybe is because of the nostalgy or maybe because really was god but the thing here is that i really liked his appearance and just like Andrew i would like to see him again as SpidermanElectro or Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx): He looks so different now and for better because in The Amazing Spiderman 2 you could barely see him without the blue color and for me it looked kinda weird and the character in this movie it was good i really liked it it was better than The Amazing Spiderman 2.Orman Osborn (Willem Defoe): This was SPECTACULAR i think that this man did a great job as an actor the way he acts at the first half of the movie it was nice he looked as he was a \"normal\" man being so innocent i believed it and then at the second half of the movie he starts acting crazy the best part of this character it\u00b4s when he is being beaten up and then he is injected with the serum and acting innocent again and he ask peter \"What have i done?\" it was so good.In summary this is the best spiderman movie in all the aspects i really recommend it if you are a MCU fan or a Spiderman fanNote: The apparence of Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) it was so funny and so damn good.", "good movie": "Superhero extravaganza! Spider-Man NWH didn't meet my expectations, it exceeded them. The most emotionally resonant MCU film so far. This movie is worth every excruciating moment we had to wait. The visuals, the score, the emotions, the story, and ofc the fan-service. This film understands spider-man fans like no other spider-man film before it. Truly a celebration of the most beloved character in the best way possible!", "A DREAM FOR SPIDER-MAN FANS.....": "First of all hatts of to the makers, script writers & everyone of them who make this movie happen. This movie is a dream for all Spidey fans and it has reached beyond our expectations. What a movie!!!Seriously no words to say just gonna say one thing go to the theatres and watch it for yourself. Because you don't know what's marvel/sony has stored for you. From the start till the end the movie keeps you engaging in every aspects. It has action, emotions & a lot of surprises. Tom just nailed his role. Superb performance by him & all other cast. Visuals & bgm are outstanding. Story was not that new but you can deal with it. Don't miss the credit scenes because it has extra surprises.....", "Worst spider-man ever": "I cringed from the first scene to the last.... Such a childish movie with cringe quote, this movie was surely made for teenagers... i miss the old marvel\nI still don't know why this movie is sooo hyped !!! Maybe bcz of zendaya and tom or all three spider in one movie !! But it was still soooo horrible that when i finished i was regretting every minute.", "All time brilliant film": "This is my favourite of the trilogy of Spider-Man films! It's an emotional roller coaster from seeing old favourites & enemies from the original SM & Amazing SM, to Aunt May passing & Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man saving MJ like he couldn't save Gwen! This film does a fantastic job balancing what we love about the current era & bringing back the love we had for the older ones! Doctor Strange is brilliant in this & adds so much. Peter losing Aunt May after losing Tony is painful but him willingly let everyone forget him for the greater good was heartbreakingly beautiful. This film is fantastic & I highly recommend seeing it. There are two credit scenes too. One after the first bit & one right at the end.", "Thanks Marvel": "Everything is told about this movie. Everyone know how awesome it is to see everyone you grow up with together. We are the generation who are built with spider man. We all dreamed of having web shooters, we will always love spider-man. So unless there is a movie with all batmans this is my favorite.", "Good - not great": "I thought this movie was really good! Really enjoyed watching it and was so happy to see Tobey Maguire back as Spider-Man along with Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin and Alfred Molina as Doctor Octavious.I grew up with those movies so those will always be special characters/actors.While the movie was good, really good, it wasn't as great as the 9/10 10/10 star reviews - there were definitely some plot holes in the movie (for example... why not just erase everyone's memory of what Mysterio told the world? That protects the Avengers, Jr. Avengers, & family and friends from forgetting who you are.7/10 is a \"solid movie that you should watch if your fans of the genre\" but I definitely don't think it rises to the level of 9/10 \"everybody on earth should see this film\" and 10/10 \"this is one of the greatest films of ALL TIME.\" It definitely was cool seeing the Spidey's together - but it didn't quite hit like that first Avengers movie.Interested in seeing where Spider-Man goes from here - hopefully that he can restore MJs memory. Ned is definitely going to become a super villain at MIT and not remember that he is Spidey's best friend.", "Peter Parker, giving it all his heart, and everything else...": "The first thing that comes to my mind is how prodigious the script writing is, masterfully layered, epic on countless levels, and moreover deeply emotional... Peter Parker faces extremely complex choices, going through a big number of ordeals, putting his heart in the front-line all the time... And yeah, it shows you how constantly trying to right every wrong is more than a monumental task for one sole being. Luckily, he has several wonderful supports -all along this chaotic journey- who give their heart to fill these roles in the best possible way, and that, in itself is very touching... But in this movie, the stakes resonate on a wide number of aspects, it isn't at all just about \"good & bad\", it's a human story (which makes it the magnificent movie that it is) and the hero at the core of all these meanders has to fully embrace his responsibilities... A true hero's journey sadly is punctuated with tragic steps that tell you how right is what you're doing. And indeed, in the end, it all takes you back to this existential question, and its heartbreaking answer : \"What did it cost ?\" ... \"Everything.\"Now on a lighter note, the easter eggs and winks to the audience, there are tons of thems and each one of them smoothly flows in the most logical & delightful way with the story (the audience cheers and applaudes on multiple occasions) ; either rewarding you in the process or planting seeds for obvious future storylines to come and develop further down the line... And again, most of these elements have an emotional impact to them, or lead you to some intriguing (and interesting) questions...\nWhat's for sure is that you go through a lot heart-grabbing moments, all along this movie... It has a lot of epicness to it, of course ; but what leaves you in awe is that the emotional aspect of all these scenes is what really leaves you blissfully happy. And when the movie's over one and for all, you can already enjoy all these clever (but numerous) little seeds, eventually evolving in new mind-blowing directions in the future...How not to applaude this movie, from its great build-up (every character has at least one thing that makes you attached to him and his eventual outcome), the way it's navigates so well between epic sequences and dialogues that add ever more to the moving aspect of it all ; leading you to this legendary last third of the movie, in which anything is a real blast (PS : the two end credits are really worth waiting for).I'll finish with the quality of the whole piece, from the nicely mastered staging, the pace (2h30 that flow like 1h), the obvious dedication (and passion) that's infused in every scene by the actors (but also by all the team behind the movie ; you can feel it all along) and the dialogs that are a delight... The special effects are once again amazing... The score offers several memorable pieces...\nNot just one of the greatest superhero movies ever, but an unforgettable movie, period.", "The best Spider-Man yet!": "I loved, loved, loved this movie. I laughed, cried felt nostalgic...just a wonderful time and what movies should be, an entertaining escape from reality!", "This is a fun ride but with few problems": "The last battle looked flat and dark. Could've been visually interesting or even the team working together rather than posing once and just standing joking around.Spider-Verse did Multiversal Travel so awesome that I hoped they would've done something when Tobey and Andrew arrived rather than them just walking through the Portal Ned creates (who by the way just apparantly knows how to do it, when the freakin' DOCTOR STRANGE had to train months and got sent to Himalayas)\nAnd why the hell couldn't Strange make people not remember 'Parker is Spiderman' rather than apparently vanishing even pictures or Birth Certificate or traces of Parker to make Peter never existed.The only action scene I remember is the one with Doctor Strange. I came home to remember how much personality those 1st 2 Raimi films had. After seeing the teaser for Multiverse of Madness, I am actually excited for that one. I hope Tobey and Andrew come back for something in the future.", "They didn't let the multitude of spider-man movies go to waste!": "The multiverse is a thing. At least in the Marvel universe.In the last few months, I've watched all the preceding Spider-Man movies to be able to appreciate this piece better - and I'll be frank: I was not a huge fan. I was never the biggest spider-man fan and also did not enjoy Spider-Man 2 as much as many others did (it was one of the worst of the spider-man movies for me).No Way Home, however, was quite pleasant.You've probably all heard about the general plotline. Mysterio got Peter's name out into the open and accused him of being a vigilante and Peter's life has gone downhill from there. Out of desperation, he paid Dr. Strange a visit and made him cast a spell to change things. But the magic has gone awry and Spider-Man related characters from all universes soon started appearing.Peter has his handful to deal with the nostalgic Spider-Man villains but also gets his fair share of time with the previous two Spider-Mans.I especially enjoyed the humor: They managed to keep the movie serious but still light-hearted and quite refreshing! There were a lot of nostalgic scenes involving the old characters and their reunions. Letting the amazing spider-man save MJ from falling? What a heartbreaking scene. The Dr. Strange scenes were always cool, even though he seemed a little underpowered in this movie.There were many plotlines to make it convenient for the movie. How could Ned just do magic?I'm not sure about the ending, though. Why would Peter not just tell MJ, Ned and Happy what happened? So I guess in the end Spider-Man won't take a place replacing Iron Man... But I suppose somewhen in the (far?) future in a possible Spider-Man 4 we will see reunions happen.Oh, and my favourite quote in the movie (I'm a mathematician): You know what's cooler than magic? Math.", "A little overrated but still a good movie": "So, I went to see the movie in the first few days of the premiere, because I've always been a huge fan of spiderman and since I was little I've watched marvel movies and stuff. I didn't think the movie was bad, I found it a little confusing at times, but even so, I think it's a good movie, I don't think it's what people say about it, I don't think it's the best Spiderman movie. The narrative has its flaws, Peter Parker goes to ask a magician who is supposed to be responsible, to help him do something that can have huge consequences and the magician warns him, but still does what he wants, and i do think he as an adult should tell him he wasn't going to do that because it was too dangerous. The movie also surprised me positively, I love the part where all the spidermans come together, because as a spiderman fan I felt a lot of happiness to see all the spidermans come together to defeat all the villains.I can say then, that I found the movie a little overrated, but still a good movie.", "Fine, but dumb plot": "The movie is fine and enjoyable enough, but the plot is terrible. It's one of those movies where the whole thing is driven by how dumb the main character is and the stupid choices they make.Don't do X. Does X.Don't trust Y. Trusts Y.Use Z to fix the problem. Doesn't use Z.Repeat.", "Well, you can't top that": "This is the best Spiderman movie ever. And there were a lot.The plot is amazing, the characters superb, and the creators knew how to press on all the emotional buttons. Well done!", "Pretty good movie": "Expected a lot, and for the most part, was satisfied. My only real problem with this movie, was the pacing. At time's it was sluggish, but it's easy to bypass. Overall this film is a nice nod to the fans. If you've ever liked a Spider-Man film, you'll enjoy this movie.", "OMG": "This is such a beautiful movie. When May dies I just cannot even\ud83d\ude22. I mean it makes soooo mush sense. Tom, Zendaya, Jacob, Andrew, Tobey, Willem, Jamie and everyone else did such a great job in this movie. The way they portray their characters is soooo perfect. Now Imma cry myself to sleep.", "A bit too much...marvel": "As many silly jokes as you'd expect in a marvel movie. Which drags the score down.Some great moments too of course.But, the way the movie treats itself at the end and just have the cake after all the sacrificing.... It's too easy. It's too easy and this movie goes from GREAT to just really good.Marvel... Needs... To... Stop doing marvel for OUNCE.Sam raimi should have made this movie.This was movie was good when it could have been great. People over hyping it because of band wagon...", "Memories": "No words man! It was simply unbelievable! What an epic experience it was! Literally brought back memories from my childhood! Thank you marvel! Thank you so much for this wonderful experience.", "I'm glad this movie exists": "First of it, sorry if I wrote bad expressions, I am not English, Iam Spanish.I will be honest. I think the movie is just as mediocre as the previous two. But it will not have the same score as its prequels for the inflated valuation it has had, as it happened to Endgame.No Way Home has been \"more than a movie.\" It has been pure and simple fan service. I think if you take away from what this movie stands out for, it's kind of absurd. But that has been the magic that has wrapped this film. Ever since Tom Holland donned the arachnid suit, there has been an endless debate between which of the 3 Spider-man seen on the big screen is the best. Everyone would rather say their favorite than have some objectivity.For me, Holland and Garfield films are not even the Raimi ones; others prefer Garfield's youthful and hooligan tone, and others prefer an even more youthful Spider-man in relation to the world's great superheroes, such as Holland's. Garfield's also shared similar characteristics to Holland's but Garfield's is the most affected of all by having a terrible production and direction, so much so that they didn't even bother to carry out the projects they had of him and they left it in oblivion to forever.This film has been a cinematic event, no matter who it may be, and no matter how bad it is. This movie does not answer the question of who is better Spider-man. Nor does it add fuel to the fire by calling for debate. This movie reconciles the fans. He suggests that you put aside the prejudices that you have had with one and the other and reunite them in an adventure (which also makes you turn a blind eye to the script), where the writers show that they have put effort and affection in the scenes where they talk together. In the meeting, in the laboratory, in the final battle ... their dialogues, their gestures ... seeing them on the big screen again after so long, fills you with emotion.Not just from the Spider-men. Seeing his villains also makes you smile. Alfred Molina as Otto is sensational again despite the fact that he could have appeared more after the attack at Pete's house; Literal Norman stealing the movie being the main villain (I almost had a fit when he stabbed Tobey's Spider-man, damn it. I thought, I haven't waited 20 years for this, don't kill him!), With that giggle and Goblin expression; Seeing Electro's Jaimie Foxx has also been emotional despite the fact that his character is somewhat absurd in his original film ... and I would like to say the same about The Sandman and The Lizard, but it is that, at least with the Sandman, I didn't like what they did with him.From the moment the Sandman is CGI and Thomas Haden Church didn't appear, I could smell what they wanted to do. And the same with the Lizard although this is a Lizard, that he gives more. And well, collecting the frames of his appearances in the original films seemed to me an impressive crap. I suppose they have not appeared for reasons of contract or personal.Anyway, I know that this film is not what is read by networks, much less, that the majority of votes are for pure fanservice, but what do you want me to tell you, I am glad that this film exists. Seeing not only Tobey Maguire putting on the suit, but also Andrew, fills me with joy, you don't know how much. I do not care that the plot of the film is based on the fact that a child does not know what to do with his wishes and affects the universes in that way; I do not care if Peter's repellent high school friends reappear because in this installment they do not appear so much, and I even do not care that, except for the main heroes, the farewells of the villains are somewhat anticlimactic and that some dialogues are forced no, the following (Jaimie Foxx talking about the black Spider-man) and that the film falls into constant inconsistencies.I am grateful to Marvel for delivering this cinematic event to us. Thank you for adding the universes from these movie sagas to the MCU, whether you like them or not. Seeing this data, dreaming is free, and who knows if Marvel has any surprises for us and we will see these heroes again. You live on dreams.PS: And doing the joke, now that they belong to the MCU, Raimi's Spider-man movies become the best trilogy. I'm gone.", "Overhyped fan service": "After the endgame Marvel has lost the mojo i didn't like any film after that Shang chi i tolerated but this one i had hopes but it was very disappointingThe makers are more interested in fan service than telling a good story to make up for lack of emotions they are killing of main characters in the film same goes with endgame iron man doesn't had to die but they kill him just to make us emotional same goes with here aunt may.There was no reason to bring out that other two Spider-Man it was just pure and simple fan service. I don't mind fan services if it doesn't make the story week and to remind all the makers of the film making sad faces in the film doesn't it make audience emotional. I like the other two Spider-Man films in this Trilogy but this one I hate it sorry to say this was terrible. At the end of the film The Hero is alone forgotten I don't know how can they come out of this shi#hole.", "Wow, wow, wow!": "Amazing movie, amazing hero. Very well played. The caracters were fantastic, especially Tom Holand and Willem Defoe - what actors...\nThe movie is full of great action, drama, comics, turnovers and everything you need. I watched 3 times but today i will watch the movie again because i have it in 4K format. One of the best hero movie ever made!", "spiderman 17: rehashed trash": "Yeah, they did it again. They told the exact same story in a slightly different way and got away with rave reviews. Guess everyone is brain-dead or too young or stoned to remember the plot to the last one...I wish we could expect something new in the future, but it looks like spiderman's real power is being reborn every 5-7 years in some alternate world, and going through the same loop of self-discovery, puppy love, loss of parental figure, final showdown with oh so predictable outcome, followed by the post-victory self-sacrificing isolation...Yo, future spiderman reboot writers, you taking notes? Rinse and repeat the above and apparently you can keep milking this mess for generations to come!What a joke. And I actually believed this time was different maybe... but instead, spoiler not spoiler, they literally had to rehash the past as they seemingly don't know how to make a proper villain anymore.Like, seriously, the only real bad guy in this whole mess is teenage stupidity and hormones... And lol i do mean the movie, but also clearly the writers.", "This movie made me seriously doubt IMDB ratings": "I am rarely motivated to take the time to rate/review movies. So the fact that I am even here typing this should tell you something. I ended up watching this movie because my child wanted to watch this so badly, citing the excellent ratings on IMDB as a reason to tell me it was worth the risk of covid exposure in a theater. I really wonder how is it even possible that people would rate this movie a 10/10 unless they are such die hard Marvel fans that they are ready to rave about anything that Marvel sends their way. Just to be clear, I have myself thoroughly enjoyed a lot of Marvel movies/series. The plot in this movie seemed like it was made up just to create a spiderman sequel. The plot seemed so dumb and lack luster. The background score seemed annoying at times. And as other reviews have pointed out, it was like someone had to tell us when exactly to laugh for what was an intended joke and on more than one occasion, the scene was a few seconds longer than it needed to be and it felt so awkward. I did not hear a single person actually laugh to any of the jokes in the theater and there were lots of people in the theater. I think this is probably the worst Marvel movie I have seen and by far.", "Would give it a 10 as a fan, but 7 more objectively.": "This has been the most exciting Marvel movie since Endgame and a historic moment in the history of film for what they pulled off! Bringing back actors from previous Spider-Man movies in the way they did! It's a miracle!(I managed to stay away from all the trailers and speculation. Now that I finally watched the trailer .... they show the whole movie in it, don't they?)So why the 7 stars? Because as much as I love all the fanservice (even if quite well done and I don't say it in a derogatory manner ), there are stll storytelling flaws - mainly with the morality aspect of the story.When Aunt May asks Peter to keep the villains here, she had only met Osborn who was freaking out about being in a new universe where nothing familiar to him (including himself) exists. And her idea of helping was to keep him here? That sounds like kidnapping! That sounds more like wanting to 'help' him herself so she can feel like a good person, rather than doing what's right for Osborn. Not saying May is that kind of person, but the writing makes it look odd atleast to me. She didn't even know about the villains dying if they returned. Besides, aren't they still going to die when they are sent back to the moment of their death despite Peter 'curing' them? If that's not so, the movie doesn't explain how.Essentially, I felt they tried to make a trolley-problem out of this when in this case the people on one of the tracks are already dead. All of this makes both Spider-Man and Dr Strange look extremely irresponsible (although not in the way the movie acknowledges) . Maybe whatever's going on with Strange that made him quite as cavalier as he was with the spell, not even discussing the parameters of it with Peter before casting it, will be explained in the Dr Strange movie. If not, it's simply out of character and feels like a contrived problem to get so many characters into the movie.Coming back to how they tried to make a trolley-problem out of this, I simply feel what Peter did was wrong - trying to 'save' the villains who were already dead (and I guess WILL die anyway once they return) and putting the entire multiverse at risk on top of risking so many more people getting pulled into the mess.", "A Fantastic and surprisingly emotional movie": "Spider-Man No way Home was a blast of a movie; it was fun, hilarious and at times, very emotional. I wasn't expecting the movie to take the turn that it did, but I'm glad that it did. Tom Holland really shines this time around. In the previous movies, he has been good yes, but here... This is a spoiler free review, but Tom gives a brilliant performance in a scene that was a real tear jerker. As for the rest of the cast - they were also fantastic. This movie more than the others, really gave our main characters a chance to shine. Zendaya is also great here, as well as Jacob Batalon and Marisa Tomei\nare also really good. I was also surprised by the screentime of, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx and Benedict Cumberbatch. I was expecting them to be in the movie for a short time, but they have a good amount of screentime, and they are great in every scene.The music in this movie is also amazing. Marvel doesn't have a good track record of good music, aside from a few, and this one is added to that few. Michael Giacchino gives his best score since UP, and I loved how he added the villian themes from previous movies.This movie does have its faults, which I won't really put here, since they dive into spoiler territory, but some scenes feel a little too, fan fiction. Almost like the writer is speaking directly to the audience. But these faults don't really drag the movie down.No way Home was a blast of a movie, with amazing acting, visuals, music and is by far the best movie in Tom Holland's Spidy series. Who would have thought the third Spider-Man movie would be the best...9/10.", "Will leave a smile on your face.": "This movie was, in my opinion, an amazing conclusion to the ENTIRE Spider-Man franchise. Seeing the three Spider-Men reunite made me feel like a child again, and it was definitely worth watching in theaters. The ending could've been better though, I was left unsatisfied with Peter's decision to avoid his friends, but other than that, it was great.", "Best movie ever !!": "This is not only the best Spider-Man / marvel movie I have seen so far, it's also the best movie ever! It has action, adventure , new themes and ideas and romance ! Loved it!", "Great expectations met with comedy dialogues and interactions.": "Firstly, this movie was an overwhelming hype before its release. Thinking back then about the interactions of 3 loved spiderman's was a daily topic on different platforms.After release, I was hoping to visualise the best movie, but it was unexpected to witness such a rushed, emotional and comedy type marvel movie. It is not surprising to find comedies in spiderman movies, but this time it was a bit too much and was rather a casual movie than a typical marvel one. Even interactions between the villains felt so trivial, this movie was clearly targeted for younger audience.I personally believe that DC movies are perhaps serious in a way which actually has a breath-taking plot, whilst spiderman has always considered more of a humorous scripts and play. I can recall that my other siblings and uncle slept back then, I was the only one left hoping that something exciting pulls off and then I can confidently wake them up, but unfortunately the movie was over before I can realise it.The movie was arguably a great execution of emotions, entertainment and climax but it could have been a blockbuster considering its potential. It lacked serious plots, tensions and maturity. At start, the movie was soul grabbing but as it gradually moved on, it was boring and dramatic.", "Spider-Man opens up the Multiverse with old familiar villains, but the story could have been better.": "Spider-man: No Way Home is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series and the third Spider-man movie in the new Spider-man series. The film is directed by Jon Watts, who also directed the previous two Spider-Man films.In the previous film, Spider-Man's secret identity was shared with the entire world. Peter Parker (Tom Holland) his life and the lives of his friends and family have now become a lot more difficult, because the whole world is after them and doesn't allow them any privacy anymore. To get things back to normal, Peter asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help. With a magic spell, Strange tries to make the whole world forget Peter's secret identity, but Peter's interference causes the spell to go awry. As a result, the multiverse breaks open and villains from other universes now end up in Peter's universe. Together with Doctor Strange and his friends, Peter must defeat these villains in order to bring them back to their own universe. They must do this before the multiverse breaks open further.With this film, Marvel gets the chance to use old villains from previous Spider-Man films in their film series and further adapt it to modern times. Fans of previous Spider-Man films can relive old times with this film thanks to the bringing back of the older villains. Despite the fact that they use a lot of old elements from the older Spider-Man films, the film itself also has a good story of its own. Here, Peter and his friends are suddenly treated differently by the rest of the world because of their newfound fame.Thanks to the improved filming techniques and Mauro Fiore as the photography director, they manage to better capture Spider-Man and the returning villains in the film. Moments now come across as more believable compared to how it was done in the older movies. With CGI, they've also rejuvenated some of the actors who play the villains, so that it's almost like they've come back from the old movies.Despite the creative sides of the story, other things are a bit simple or a bit weakly brought to the fore in the story. As a result, drama moments and tension of certain events can be lost a bit. If the story had been better written, the movie itself could have been a lot better.The returning cast members from the previous Jon Watts Spider-Man films have to play their characters in some dark and dramatic ways. Tom Holland and Zendaya know how to bring this to the fore, but thanks to the script, Jacob Batalon continues to be used more for comic moments in the film.The returning villains from previous Spider-Man films manage to recreate their roles in this film in a recognizable way and some even get the chance to expand their roles a little better or more in this film.", "Spider -Man No Way Home review :": "This movie is a next level Marvel movie. This movie carries on with a fast pace and contains many surprises which will surely make u cheer and will wish if that scene lasts forever. It also has numerous comedy scenes. The CGI and VFX used in this movie is the life of the movie. All the actors are in their best form especially Willem Dafoe (Green Goblin) and Tom Holland (Spider-Man). The background score is very peaceful and each music gives the perfect feeling of that particular scene.Movie rating : 4/5\nPlot : 3/5\nActing : 5/5\nBackground score : 3/5\nCGI and VFX : 5/5\nSurprises : 5/5.", "Characterization, nostalgia and fan service done right. No Way Home is easily the best thing in MCU Phase 4.": "As a long time fan of The MCU since its inception back in 2008, Phase 4 has been wholly disappointing. Even the stuff I enjoyed had elements in them that kept it from being good, let alone great. Granted, I haven't seen everything in Phase 4 yet (a couple of Disney+ series I have yet to watch) but it's hard to muster up the excitement when you're consistently being let down by a franchise that you once revered. One of my main criticisms has been the world-building, particularly when it comes to the multiverse; the lazy writing and the incohesive melding of this expansion of the universe to what came before. So when it was revealed that the next Spider-Man movie will have multiverse shenanigans as they'll be bringing old villains from previous non-MCU spidey films as well as rumours that the spider-men themselves might make an appearance, I was a bit apprehensive about that news, especially considering how established characters have been treated going forward whether in the MCU or in other franchises which is probably the biggest criticism I have with Phase 4. Also, the fact that nostalgia baiting and keychain jangling have been the norm for a while now certainly wasn't helping the anticipation levels either. So imagine my surprise when this movie simply said \"Hey fam. Fret not. We got this.\" Suffice to say I had an exhilarating experience and it reminded me of why I used to love the MCU.Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) picks up right where Far From Home ended with Spider-Man's identity now revealed to the world and him being framed as the one who killed Quentin Beck or Mysterio; now Peter and his friends have to deal with the fallout. The entire first act was the weakest part of the movie as I was not engaged or entertained to the extent I wanted to be or I wasn't \"feeling\" it even if there was entertainment to be had; Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock from Netflix's Daredevil making his MCU debut appearance to help Spidey being a notable highlight (the entire one-shot scene before that was dope too). This was mainly due to the messy and rushed writing at crucial plot points to get the rest of the story going, particularly Dr Strange (one of my favourite MCU characters) coming off like an idiot with the handling of the spell when at this point in the MCU he should know better. However, when the main plot kicks in due to the spell going awry, the movie started getting better and didn't let up till the end and surprised me in the best of ways.Now, I had only watched one main trailer but unfortunately, the rumour about other spider-men making an appearance being true was spoiled for me since I wasn't able to watch it in theatres. What I was not privy to, thankfully, was in what capacity were they gonna be in the movie nor most of the plot details and how it pans out, so I was ecstatic when it turned out that both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are not just cameos but full-fledged secondary characters. Similarly, the villains had a much bigger role and presence than what I had assumed from the trailer, particularly Doc Ock and Green Goblin, and it was glorious.The thing I loved the most was how director Jon Watts, who has now successfully helmed all the Spidey movies in the MCU, and the writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers were able to meticulously take the meta-narrative and pop culture sentiments of both the Raimi Trilogy and The Amazing Spider-Man duology, write it into the plot of this universe while maintaining the integrity of what came before and give the old characters new arcs where they can grow, all the while making sure that Tom Holland's Spidey remains the central focus. In other words, the characterization was sublime. Mad props for achieving this and setting a prime example of how to effectively utilize nostalgia and fan service. It also goes to show that if you can nail down your characters, then the weight of faults in other areas reduces drastically.The actors didn't hold back either. This was the best performance from Tom Holland as Spider-Man and Zendaya as MJ, and this was the best depiction of them as a couple (Andrew and Emma are still my favourites). Tobey Maguire felt right at home as the oldest Spidey who has the most experience and hence, the most wisdom. Alfred Molina was once again wonderful as Doc Ock, particularly when Peter fixes the neural inhibitor chip; the performance, the FEELS. Jamie Fox and Rhys Ifans were having a blast as Electro and Lizard considering how these villains were treated in the TASM movies. But the ones who stole the show were Willem Dafoe and Andrew Garfield. What a performance by both of them. Willem felt as if he had time travelled from the set of Spider-Man (2002) and jumped straight into No Way Home with his nuanced dual-personality performance and the madlad at his age did most of the stunts which not only shows but adds even more menace to every scene he was in. Garfield getting a second chance at being Spidey after the failure of TASM and utilizing that in every single scene to his best had me smiling and riddled with FEELS.Speaking of emotions, I was not expecting this movie to move me several times to the extent that I was tearing up. I love all three renditions of live-action Spider-Man even though, granted, some of the movies aren't good in retrospect. It was absolutely surreal witnessing them together and interacting with each other, whether real talk or fun banter. Same case with the villains. I loved the interplay, I loved the banter, I loved the interactions no matter how small or big and I wish there was more. I also greatly appreciated the restraint on the typical MCU humour during serious scenes where many other movies have failed to do so by undercutting tension willy nilly. My favourite scene was probably when Tobey and Andrew first meet Tom and console him; man tears abound.Technically, this was a solid production. The de-ageing effects were great (Marvel has kinda perfected it by this point), the visual effects were pretty good even if not mindblowing, and there was some beautiful cinematography at display in certain scenes such as Peter mourning the loss of Aunt May in the rain. The soundtrack by Michael Giacchino was beautiful whether it's the revamped MCU Spidey theme, the incorporations of older themes or new tracks for this film.Regarding faults, as mentioned earlier, the writing when it came to the plot and how some of its mechanics worked was weak and made some characters appear stupid. Not all characters had similar levels of characterization and the one that stood out the most was Sandman whose actions, later on, contradicted his motivations as well as where we last saw his character in Spider-Man 3. The humour, while relatively restrained and landing in a lot of areas did fall flat sometimes.Overall, I was in a blissful state by the time this movie ended having been reminded why I used to enjoy the MCU. Tom Holland Peter makes the biggest sacrifice as a true Hero would, ending on a bittersweet note, and it felt as if instead of having a single origin movie, MCU Spidey got to have three to come at a place where he can now carry forward as the classic Spidey, and it's character writing like this that MCU should be focusing on in other properties too since it is what made it famous in the first place. You can have all the crazy plots and scenarios as you want but if the characters inhabiting them are not interesting and consistent, well then you can say goodbye to long term investment. Had the movie done what so many others have done with nostalgia and fan service, this would have been a completely different review. Even though it's not the tightest in terms of writing in the Jon Watts Spidey Trilogy (Homecoming takes that one), it's my favourite. I sure do hope that Doctor Strange 2 doesn't take the wrong lessons from this success. And if I were to rate this, I'd give it an 8.5/10.", "One of the best crossovers of all time!": "MCU's Spider-Man teaming up with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield is the greatest to ever come. I mean Tobey's Spider-Man has been my favorite Marvel hero alongside Hulk of course, but this film is such a dimensional triumph that you can't take your eyes off!", "This movie live up to its hype": "The first part of the movie had to give a closing to the end of the second movie so it did feel a bit rushed, specially how murdock dealt with the issue; we could've seen a bit more on that matter. Neverthelss, I think this film portrayed the best death scence of the MCU, mainly because we didn't see it happening until last last minute of realisation. We are lead to believe that she was fine (as for such film) but in fact she wasn't, and realising Peter didn't have a biological family really hit me bad. I could resonate with the feeling perfectly (even though I havent been through that.)Lastly, the ending where everyone forgets who he is gave a similar feeling of emptiness and loss. Not only he doesn't have a family, but he's truly alone as no one remembers him. However, he did finally became the spider man we know off, skipping in buildings of NY.I disliked however, that JJJ was too evil. Normally he's a stone in the shoe but I feel they took it too far with this version. Also, I feel that Dr Strange could've prevented a lot of this by ensuring Peter taht the spell would affect EVERYONE, and not just whom Peter wanted to. Some poor communication from someone that smart.", "Better than endgame": "The best Marvel movie ever, the best, woow just crazy. Every emotion has come, power , love, laugh, everything, my heart was pounding I'd rate endgame a 9.0, and no way home 10.", "Marvel up and DC down. Stop blaming Marvel it is DC that is the problem": "This movie was what i needed, it was very funny and great acting with so many surprises.Without a doubt, the nostalgia factor plays an important role in this new film, despite reusing some challenges from the past, they manage to give it a different approach and make them feel quite fresh and innovative. With all this, adding that this has the biggest and most ambitious production of the franchise, not only showing us the results of a joke or a challenge, but also making this an impressive audiovisual show.The hardest I laughed in a loooong time. Absolutley amazing.", "A web of chaos and enjoyment.....": "My rating: 97/100 (9/10)No spoilers here.... An absolutely incredible film! It was a lot to take in, but it was worth the journey. Having caught up with the previous films this one was a little easier to understand, however, I was still lost at times due to my limited exposure and knowledge of the Marvel universe. If you love Spider-man you should absolutely see this film in theatres if you have the chance. I don't think you'll be disappointed. With the villains from other Spider-man movies making an appearance it brought back some great nostalgia. It actually made me wish there was more, but in the end I personally wasn't disappointed with what I was offered.", "And so much more": "This movie not only lived up to all the hype and expectations it exceeded them! Wow! So good!!! Honestly, I didn't know how they were going to bring all these stars into one movie and do them all justice, but man did they ever!", "This film is everything The Eternals isn't.": "Without doubt this is the best Spider Man film yet made. It's filled with character, passion, loss, humor and pathos; plus the special guest stars will bring a smile to your face. Our cinema cheered when they appeared.This film is everything The Eternals isn't.", "Spider-Man: No Way Home Exceeded my Expectations": "This movie was more than I could ask for. Everything from that first cameo from a special character to the end of the movie, it kept getting better. Tom Holland's acting in those emotional scene was what elevated this movie even more. Perfect nostalgia with call backs to best catchphrases and moments from previous Spider-Man movies, This movie is everything a Spider-Man could ask for.Green Goblin saying \" I'm something of a scientist myself\"\nDoc Ock saying \"The power of sun in the palm of my hand\nTobey saying \"You're Amazing\" to Andrew\nSandman working together with Spider-Man when he first meets Tom's Spider-Man\nAnd Green Goblin being as menacing as ever. One of the best theatre experience ever.", "Best anyone can ask of a Spider-Man finale": "Amazing movie with great acting and fantastic effects. It brings to a close amazingly not only the last trilogy but all three of the Spider-Man series. I'm not sure how anyone could've asked for much more out of this film. It delivers what is expected wonderfully.", "Spectacle over substance, and makes Tom Holland's Spider-Man into a jerk": "How am I supposed to root for a hero who attacks Dr Strange, strands him in the mirror dimension and steals his ring, then releases five highly dangerous superpowered individuals and brings then to a residential apartment building full of civilians?Everything bad that happens from that point on is Spider-Man's fault. This is a recurring theme in the MCU Spider-Man trilogy: in Homecoming his negligence with a Chitauri power core almost gets his friends killed, and in Far From Home (by far the best film of the three) he accidentally activates drones to attack his school's tour bus, again leaving all of his friends seconds from death. How am I supposed to empathise with a superhero who's so reckless and juvenile, and who is forced by the terrible writing to constantly make poor decisions that endanger those around him just so there can be An Action Scene? This is not Spider-Man.", "The ultimate Spiderman Endgame": "I wasn't a big fan of the teenage spiderman concept, but Tom Holland and the story really did grew into what \"Spiderman\" deserved to be. This movie really was exactly what I had been waiting for, for a looong long time. And they did it perfectly. It's partly because of spoilers I went to watch the movie, but am I glad I did. For me this was what I needed because they covered so many unfinished topics and I'm thankful they made this the way they did. I can't wait for what's next.", "Movie terrible": "Let's be honest, there's nothing from any media that deserves a 10/10, especially for crap like this, how is this movie 8.7? How unfair, while good Spiderman movies like Tobey Maguire's 1 and 2 got a low rating, horrible movies like this one that was made just to make fanfic and please Marvel addicts, Poor, horrible and pointless script, Exaggerated CGI and extremely unnecessary with a horrible direction, I think the only argument people find this movie good and get a 10 for these people addicted to Marvel, It's precisely because of having the 3 Spider-Man together, and of course, Exaggerated CGI with several clich\u00e9s that every little fan from Marvel likes it, sincerelygrade 2/10.", "WEB SLINGING EPIC \ud83d\udd78": "Omg WOW! Just...WOOOOOW!!! This is top-tier epic seeing old faces make a returning comeback!! And also I tip my hat to Tom Holland. This is the best profomance as Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet!! Can't wait to see more of what he can do with this beloved character. The story is so emotional in many feels and it's grounded very well! I never thought as a Spider-Man fan would love this film as much as I did as a kid growing up! It's the greatest Marvel movie of all time and it will forever have a special place in my heart.

There's so much care and so much attention to detail I recommend a second viewing to experience and just plain comprehend everything this movie has to offer.", "No movie is perfect but.....": "Spoiler freeI will make this really simple. If you are looking for a movie that's going to give you a good time with nostalgia, good action, and well written comedy, this delivers!It had everything you could want from a Spider-Man movie.Lastly, I want to say that in the past I wasn't sure about the Peter /MJ chemistry in these films. I couldn't have been more wrong.", "Home run!": "Another fantastic addition to the Tom Holland series of Spiderman films. It packs a lot in what with the multiverse concept and the return of some characters from previous Spiderman runs. But it's handled well and it's certainly good to see some of them (though some are more memorable than others!). It definitely confirmed my opinion that Holland is the best Spiderman - he's just such a natural fit to the character. The action looks great as always and there's a bit more emotion in this film than others - it's definitely the most serious of the 3. Given who features in the post-credit scene it will be interesting to see where they go next.", "Amazing film!": "Arguably the best Spider-Man movie out there at the moment! Cinematography and vfx was top-notch along with actually giving a legitimate reason to put in a lot of villains,Unlike TASM2. But I will not spoil the movie as people should expect nothing but a surprise on the big screen...", "It's worth it.": "I felt like a little kid all over again and I'm 25, I won't give out any spoilers here as I sometimes do with my reviews, but amazing action, great effects, and the chemistry between the cast is phenomenal. I wanted to cry from nostalgia during certain scenes. The only reason this movie did not receive a 10 from me is a recurring issue I have with all the newer marvel movies, too much humor in the scenes that probably could or should be serious. I'm not saying the whole thing has to be dark and gritty like a Batman movie. But maybe more of the kind of humor we saw in the original Spider-Man trilogy with Toby. Highly recommend, best Spider-Man film since Toby Maguire's Spider-Man 2 hands down.", "Best spider man movie": "Frankly Everything thing was great about the filmed. The only negative thing is that I wish the investigation at the beginning of the film would be more accurate.", "one of the best theatre experiences in a long time, 9.5 out of 10": "This movie is an absolute blast from start to finish and been in a packed theatre and hearing the reactions of the fans was the best reception i had ever seen from a cinema crowd, it gave me a lot of things to love, tobey, andrew, doc ock, green goblin, sandman, lizard and electro was much better in this than in TASM2. Tom holland is spiderman to me and will be forever and of course i have always loved the rest of the cast zendaya as MJ and jacob batalon as ned are both amazing and benedict cumberbatch, although in the movie that much, really shines every time he is on screen. I do have one issue with the movie however and that was Peter's logic in trying to cure the villains, i thought it was nice to show that he wouldn't just let these people and showing that everyone deserves a second chance but his logic to me just didn't make sense, i saw it coming from the very start that something was going to go wrong and that did kind of frustrate me a little but all in all in didn't take away from my experience that i had with it, and it is still one of my favourite mcu films and my favourite spiderman movie.Overall 9.5 out of 10.", "Pure entertainment": "This movie is a great one. I wouldn't go as far to say that it's a masterpiece, but it's one of the most exciting movies I've seen.The dynamic between the 3 spideys is truly awesome, and aunt Mays death is heart wrenching and gets you in the feels. The CGI is great as well.However, It is not a perfect movie. After seeing it for the 3rd time, the plot holes become more apparent and they're hard to ignore at times.

I felt they were to independent and carried the weight of Avengers. Yet they were fun entertainment. But this instalment called \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" (2021) was best of the three. If you are a fan of Spider Man in general - go see this on the biggest screen possible, and i will say it no more.Overall, \"No Way Home\" didn't felt like a 2 h 20 min movie because it is superbly entertaining. Directing was terrific due to superb pacing - every minute of this movie wasn't boring or anything.

Well done Marvel for a truly original concept which was fantastically directed. I found myself not being lost in the blur of CGI as I have in previous recent Marvel productions.

Can I just say how awesome this was with the three Spider-Men. The different villains that each Spider-Men had in their universe was so fun.

This was great watching this very good movie.", "Hard watch": "If your a Marvel fan you will big this film up.Realistically the storyline was no existent.Acting was below par.They threw money at a project which guaranteed a return.But the film expectations are at a such higher rate now after films such as Endgame, Deadpool, Guardians of the Galaxy and the Disney TV series even feel better thought out then this garbage.", "The best movie in Marvel phase 4": "As Marvel phase 4 has come to an end, I consider no way home as the best Marvel movie after Endgame. First of all, this movie has chosen a really interesting topic that will draw the audience's attention together as it gathered all the elements from the previous two spiderman movies. Even though it's been a long time, the movie still left remarkable characterics and features in each of the villans. The plot was smooth and excuted well. Unlike Black Widow, the movie doesn't have unnecessary scenes and it also comes with great actions. This movie also symbolises the growth of Peter Parker. Enjoy.", "Good time": "I enjoyed this movie, it was fun, entertaining and the story itself was actualy pretty interesting, not the greatest, but kept me interested. The one thing that brought this movie down is the constant attempt at humor, it took what could be really cool and turned it into an SNL skit, and what should have been serious was more of a joke bc this is Marvel, everything has to be funny, all the time. Im not saying it was all bad, i got a few laughs here and there, but it was to over the top sometimes and i just think the movie would have been better if they dialed it down a notch and just told a good story without everything having to be funny.", "NOT Good": "I Believe The Concept Of The Movie Was a Way To Make The World Forget That Peter Parker Was Spiderman, Web-Head, The Wall Crawler, Spidey, But In Doing So Super Villains From Other Spiderman Dimensions Showed Up, So Spidey Wants To Change Their Fate, Make Them Good Law Abiding Citizens...One Problem \"They Are Super Villains\" And Without Super Villains There Are No Superheroes! So In the Process Of Doing This Poor Aunt May Dies, Mmm, If The Web-head Wouldn't Have Tried To Make People Forget That He Was Peter Parker, The Super Villains Wouldn't Have Showed Up And Aunt May Would Still Be Alive, The Movie To Me Should Have Taken Another Route Because It Was Really Stale, Dumb And Boring!", "very good movie": "One of the greatest comic book adaptations ever, daredvil, Infinty War and The Dark knight would be up ther but Baby driver is better than all objectively, Tom holland is a good actor and Ned is the 2nd best character in film, Baby from baby driver solos, Doctor Strange is so old lol hahahahahh hes going to die soon, andrew garfield is a fenomenal actor and a massive sigma hwat a goat but not as good as ansel egerton I love Tony maguire but ansel egerton still clear overall. Baby driver is a nihilstic film which files miles known as \"baby\" in which he repays a debt to a crime boss whom took pity on a young baby and is not for the average viewer as it is for sigmas like me and patric bateman, and kanye west. Spider man no way home is also for sigmas but quite as cool as me, bateman and Ye are.", "Pure entertainment!": "Script is clever. Loved the way they made sense to everything and all the actors did very well too. Non-stop entertainment, and ideally watch in IMAX!", "It took a while but it kept escalating to something amazing.": "Reminded me of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Marvel comics is use to turning personal stories into epic events but for me that's strange for the movies.It does work better for the design of these Spider-Man movies, simple because spider-man is perfectly design for those personal stories. In this case it was one of the biggest crisis Peter Parker had to face when one of Spider-Man's biggest enemies J. Jonah Jameson (think about it) reveals to the world that he's spider-man. The event has Parker taking on personal issues that come with the reveal as Spider-man comes under criminal allocations (forcing him to need a lawyer (wink, wink), and his fame as the web swinging Avenger is divided, by those who love him and those who hate him. All this, not only messing up his life but the lives of those closet to him so he does a Marvel team up with Dr. Strange to change all that.The results of this team up turn No Way Home into the ultimate Fan film bringing together everything we loved about Spider-Man in Cinema for the last twenty years. In this plot No Way Home was spectacular. They paid homage to everything good about all the Spider-Man movies and poked fun of everything bad about the Spider-Man movies. We got to relive some things in spider-man movies that were not all that good made so much better in this film and things that were sensational in some of the movies were made even more sensational for this movie. Would love to be more detailed about what I'm talking about, but there is far too much story to spoil so I don't think I can.I'll say that No Way Home is an evolution for Spider-Man. We literally get so much Spider-Man, noting that next year will be the characters 60th birthday and it feels like we are getting that anniversary special a year (or few mouths) early. The best part is that as much as I love Tom Holland's Spider-Man he finally becomes the Spider-Man comic fans have known for the past 60 years in this movie.The action was exciting, the level of drama was top level. It could have made me laugh more but I loved the fact that they were more concern with showcasing the true type of hero Spider-Man is. I wonder if that has something to do with the fact that even though this film takes place in the Marvel Cinematic universe, it's obviously from opening credits to end credits not a Disney movie?Excellent, comic book movie!", "Generally good fun, a bit long, a bit predictable": "I enjoyed this movie, and laughed out loud several times. But I also found the pace a bit slow at times.I might also say it was familiar. There's not a lot here that hasn't been done in a Marvel movie before. If I'm noticing that, I'm obviously not fully invested in the experience.I'm also found myself wondering just how long the teen angst and immaturity stuff was going to last. You find out in the end, but still.I particularly enjoyed the reunion portion, though that was a bit over done as well. What ever happened to the tight 100 minute movie? Is it in the contracts that each actor must get a certain amount of screen time? Yes, I know the answer.In short, I thought Far from Home was the better flick. I think this one is just getting higher marks because it's not woke garbage we've been seeing recently.A good time, not a great time.", "Okay but not great": "It was fun to watch. But the plot was very poor.The whole story of the movie is set in motion by very stupid choices by the hero's that should know better than this.", "Overhyped": "The film was good overall but not at all what I expected. The entr\u00e9es of Tobey and Andrew could be so much better and more epic. Their was some scenes I appreciated like Andrew saving mj when she was falling and thanks to that making Andrew get a second chance after losing Gwen. Willem Dafoe did a great job ones again playing both goblin and Norman. Probably best acting of at least the villains in the movie. I never liked Tom as Spider-Man, great actor but I feel like the movies get to unserious with him, no way home included. That's one of the main reasons why I'm going to give this movie a 6 out of 10, but of course many other reasons as well.", "Soo good": "This movie has soo much fan service. It was great.

Doctor strange does a spell witch opens up the Multiverse, witch leads up to his Aunt may to get killed and Innocent civilians, while putting Zendaya in danger over trying to make the BAD GUYS good and not die instead of putting them back in their universe. All because you didn't want anybody to know your identity and go to MIT.I know that other spidermen are in this movie to but don't get much screen time.

However, I felt the film did not exactly delivered to its promise. The concepts were good, but there were too many cliches, forced \"humor\", and at the end it became too predictable. This is primarily a film for the fanboys and visuals lovers.", "Not a superhero movie fan but this nailed it": "I don't mind superhero movies but tend to watch them as individual movies and not following the subplots between them all. This film really nails it though, it is a great film with plenty of twists and turns, and it is so round just brilliant, and easily brings themes from other movies into it.The twist is Epic as well.I would be surprised if this is not one of the film's of the year.", "What a terrible mess": "What a complete mess of a movie. Since Disney bought the franchise it is becoming more and more ridiculous over the years.Let's turn Spiderman into a multiverse mess, with Dr. Strange playing God and even bringing actors from actually good movies to try and save it all in the end.Wrong suit (again), Peter Parkers have a tendency to not wear a mask, even in the middle of a sandstorm, ridiculous MJ, ridiculous plot, terrible CGI that defies gravity everywhere (again).What the hell did I just see? Me and my kid were looking into eachother in desbelief.Has Disney and Marvel lost all sense of good story writing? Is the Spiderman universe so limited in good villains to have to recicle old villains and even old Peter Parkers into this mess? Read some old comics and learn why Spiderman was one of the most inventive and interesting characters in Marvel.This looked like a mix between a Dr. Strange movie and an Avengers movie, let's bring all the toys together, make a big soup of the script and in the end rub it all out with some godlike spells.Spiderman deserves better, Stan Lee deserves better.Disney should sell their Marvel rights and give the franchise to someone capable of doing justice to the real Spiderman.What's next? Obviously another terrible Venom impersonation (perhaps from another actor) that finally confronts Spiderman (again) as if it wasn't already done in the past (and in a better way)Read some real comics, you will better served than this.", "Excellent movie!": "Spider-Man: No Way Home\nI'm Speechless & Overwhelmed.

Game-changer in the web-headed franchise with Peter Parker (Holland at his most affable best) facing public awareness of his identity threatening his loved ones and involves Dr. Strange (Cumberbatch) to concoct a spell that goes sideways which splinters the MultiVerse with past foes of 'other' Spider-men to enter our own void. Stunning visual effects with astounding action sequences and peppered with enough meta humor for several film the apparent final chapter of the HOME trilogy does just that - hits home. A lot of fun and by all means splurge on the IMAX version.", "Nothing much new, thankfully din't watch it in theatres.": "Story: The story is similar to the animated movie released in 2018, Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse. The difference is the heroes and the villain's that are caught in current universe are from previous non animated movies, rather than totally different universe.What light ones up is the heroes coming from previous movies but still the idea is somewhat stolen. I had a lot of hopes from this movie felt sad for not watching it in theatres, however I am thankful for that decision now.", "No Way Perfect": "Just because we get to see all 3 Spider-Man in the film doesn't make it the perfect Spiderman movie.I thought that the plot move really quickly, to give the film plenty of time to explore the returning villains, which is good. But for a movie with 5/6 villains, there are only 2 action sequences, and a very underwhelming climax.Surely, they could have done more paying tribute to the old films, and at the same time adding the new one to the mix. The ending feel little rush, and feels too family friendly.Nonetheless, respect for Kevin to finally bring all 3 Spideys to the big screen.", "I just realized...": "You know what's cool about this movie?

Not only does Peter Parker come full circle in his development into the webslinger he was meant to be, but every moment of nostalgia didn't feel like a cheap cash-in for the fans but rather something meaningful and important to drive the story forward and for Peter as a character. It is one of the many marvel films that manages to bring it all in terms of action, comedic/emotional moments, and nostalgia that works all wrapped in a perfect bow. I may have some bias mainly because I've been a fan of the webslinger all my life but to me, there is no question that this is the greatest MCU, if not the greatest Marvel film, I've watched. Highly recommend.", "Excellent movie": "They did really good putting the three Spider-Man movies together. The actors were fascinated and the multiverse was an interesting point.

Deserves an easy nine.", "Hype.": "This movie was something different, and by far gave me the best cinema experience I have ever had and most likely will ever have. Now I wouldn't have given the movie a 10, however the way I was jumping out of my seat and cheering when Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire appeared on my screen can never be topped. 10 year old me would have given anything to see this film and I would give anything to go back to release night and watch it again, amazing.", "Amazing!!": "I'm Speechless & Overwhelmed.

They could have done something really cool with the whole identity-reveal thing, but instead it veered off into extremely confusing territory.In the earlier Tom Holland movies, the interactions between Peter and his friends from school is what gives the movies life, but here their relationship fell a bit flat. All their lines are so cliche and difficult to take seriously.But the biggest problem is the nonsensical character motivation. Each and every one of the inciting incidents made zero sense. First of all, why would Peter go to Dr Strange over some college applications? Secondly, why would Dr Strange cast such a dangerous spell over something of so little consequence? And thirdly, why would Peter think it was a good idea to try to save some random villains from a different dimension??? I mean, they'd have to go back anyway, and even if he manged to change them, he has no idea what happens to them when he sends them back, or how that changes the dimension that they came from.It was cool to see the other Spider-men, but it felt a bit like that was this movie's only focus. In the end Peter changed everything back anyway, so does this movie contribute to anything in the MCU at all??? I feel like after this movie, litterally nothing has changes except that everyone who ever knew Peter Parker must have a very confusing jumble of memories. Like, how does that even work out? *sigh*", "Good drama!!": "This is one of the best Spiderman movies in terms of emotions. The movie as usual had great action and humour. The ending was moving. Looking forward for the next installment.", "NO WAY HOME: BEST THEATRICAL EXPERIENCE DURING PANDEMIC": "The pandemic may continue to spread fear amongst the fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But that did not stop them in watching a movie that will forever leave a mark in their lives.Spider-Man: No Way Home is the latest installment of MCU's Spider-Man and it follows Peter Parker trying to maintain both hero and personal life after his identity is exposed by Mysterio from Far From Home. But things got way out of hand as he confronts Dr. Strange to cast a spell which brought forth villains from the multiverse.Before I dive in and share my thoughts about the film, it's best to also share my experience with the previous two movies.Homecoming was not exactly a memorable film for me though I found it good like a 7/10. In Far From Home, however, the film managed to lift my expectations for the franchise to a 9/10. How about this third film you may ask? Well I would say it is easily the best from the three and I'll explain why.And since all of its trailers show certain parts of the movie, those are the ones I will be talking such as the characters and events. For the spoilers, I will be leaving a caution throughout the review so be warned.Let me just start off by saying how undeniably amazing majority of the cast are. Almost every single one of them delivered their roles well according to their characters and they did not disappoint me at all.For obvious reasons, MCU's Spider-Man Tom Holland definitely carried the film throughout its runtime because of his fun charisma and also a relatable character because of his challenge trying to figure out who he wants to be after the past events that led to this.MJ played by Zendaya is, as always, great at delivering hilarious lines at the right time and you can see that her chemistry with Tom Holland do fit well as boyfriend and girlfriend - supporting each other through thick and thin.Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds, the best friend of Peter Parker, is also good in the movie and his contribution in the trio, though might lead to some success and failure, is always funny and cool to look at.The biggest part of the cast that I would definitely want to give praise on is how they managed to bring some of the villains from the different films of Spider-Man altogether in one cinematic plot.Alfred Molina as Dr. Otto Octavius has always been my most favorite villain from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy and he really didn't fail in his character as he maintained the personality and is one of those few characters who I want, as an audience to change.Speaking of Sam Raimi's trilogy, who on earth would not forget Willem Dafoe acting out Green Goblin because he is definitely an interesting character to expound on and the film did manage to level his character up.Then of course we have Thomas Haden Church who played the Sandman who I did not like at first but his role in the film did made me want him, just like Dr. Otto, to maintain his good side.As we continue on mentioning the films of Spider-Man, it would be right to mention Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man because even though I don't generally like both films, the villains inclusion in the story did add some excitement to it.I am very happy that both Rhys Hans' Lizard and Jamie Foxx's Electro were also given a lot of upgrade and while they also act as villains, they also shared some of their personal side so that I could connect to them a lot more.Lastly, Marissa Tomei as Aunt May probably delivered one line that would forever change the perception of Peter Parker as a hero and his outlook on what it really means to have true change in people.My minor issue with the movie in terms of the character aspect would be Dr. Strange played by Benedict Cumberbatch. While he was really good in the film, I was mildly disappointed that his role wasn't much of a mentor and didn't do anything much.It's time to dive into the plot structure of the film. The first act was great in setting up some of the conflicts arising with regards to Peter's identity being exposed to the world. As a result, he faces a lot of challenges in getting into college alongside confused on which side he would choose.The minor issue that I have is the fact that it went into a wish-fulfillment wherein Peter wishes for Dr. Strange to erase the memory of people who know Peter Parker which would later on create more conflict to the story. Thankfully, that's the only issue I have because as the story moves on, it becomes more amazing.The second act was able to not just let Peter Parker encounter the villains from the multiverse but what also felt like a pure fan-service rollercoaster because although it might seem at first like a video game plot, the characters themselves saved the film as it reached to a point where things need to get serious now.The final act has probably some of the most epic and satisfying sequences that will forever be ingrained in my mind and have a realization of what it means to the future of the Spider-Man franchise.This was helped because of the musical score that was made by Michael Giacchino who also did an accompaniment with Pixar movies such as Up and Ratatouille as well as sci-fi like Star Trek (2009) and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.After watching the film, I realized that there were a lot of themes presented to me that I could easily relate to since I am already at the age of adulthood. Like how media and the press could easily manipulate the perception of people, what it means to be prepared for what life is up ahead, and how people still see the change in others managed to stick with me a lot.As a fan of the MCU, it really was a rollercoaster of emotions. Not only did I feel nostalgic because of the villain's appearances, but I was completely emotional and satisfied with how Tom Holland and the rest of the actors managed to live up to the hype that this fan-service film had. Especially during this pandemic, I was happy to watch something like this alongside Dune that still gives me hope in a cinematic experience.", "If Spiderman is your all-time favourite superhero, this will be your new favourite movie": "What can I say? This movie is brilliant. Too brilliant. Fantastic. Clever. Heart-warming. Perfect from the start till the end.The whole production was brilliant. If Spiderman is your all-time favourite superhero, and if you're a 90s kid, you'll come out of the theatre thinking this is possibly the best movie ever made. Or a Marvel movie, at least.DON'T SKIP THIS MOVIE. Enjoy. :)", "Emotion-Driven Spidey Action": "I'm the kind of guy who doesn't mind knowing spoilers before watching a movie. \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" on Amazon prime VOD was a tempting prospect, more so since I didn't have the time to catch it in theatres. That said, the movie held all the MCU tropes and tricks that I as a fan have come to appreciate. I liked it regardless of all the spoilers Instagram made me privy to.\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" seamlessly picked up where events left off in \"Far From Home\". Peter Parker's identity was out, and he was struggling to make sense of the chaos that followed in the aftermath of such a dangerous reveal. Add Dr. Strange (my favourite MCU character) to the mix, and there was a multiverse of possibilities unravelling in this brilliant movie.Good direction by Jon Watts. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers did remarkable work on scripting \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" - though it often felt like people were saying 'Peter Parker' too many times. Michael Giacchino's musical scoring was top notch - he also scored for \"The Batman\" (my favourite DCU character). I was a little disappointed to see Giacchino use more 'silent scenes' than ones with consistent MCU-style musical scoring, but oh well.Mauro Fiore's cinematography was aces. Darren Gilford's production design was wonderful. The art direction and set decoration teams did amazing work as well. Sanja Milkovic Hays's costume design was superb. The hair-makeup, stunts, sound effects, CGI, and VFX teams did outstanding work on this project.For as long as Tom Holland is alive, nobody else can play Spider-man better than he can, in my opinion. He did an outstanding job as Spidey in \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\", especially considering all that was going on. That Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire reveal, though! Made my day in more ways than one. They were involved for a while in the film, and it made for great viewing.MJ (played by Zendaya) was remarkable. Doctor Strange (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) was excellent, though he felt a bit powerless in this one, tbh. Ned Leeds (played by Jacob Batalon) was great. Happy Hogan (played by Jon Favreau) was good. Wong (played by Benedict Wong) was noteworthy. May Parker (played by Marisa Tomei) was good - her death felt a teeny bit convenient, though, imo. J. Jonah Jameson (played by J. K. Simmons) was good. Matt Murdock aka Daredevil (played by Charlie Cox) was superb to see make a cameo in this movie.The baddies brought their own brilliance to the film. Max Dillon aka Electro (played by Jamie Foxx) was memorable, though his performance was surprisingly robotic and lacklustre. Dr. Curt Connors aka The Lizard (played by Rhys Ifans) was good. Flint Marko aka Sandman (played by Thomas Haden Church) was also good. Norman Osborn aka Green Goblin (played by Willem Dafoe) was timeless perfection, but his motives were not as compelling as I'd have liked them to be. Dr. Otto Octavius aka Doc Ock (played by Alfred Molina) was nostalgic magnificence, but most of his scenes felt like a man who couldn't quite make up his mind about which side to choose instead of the Doc Ock we all know and love.The movie was slow in several places, but that was entirely welcome in order to convey the mood of the moment. They lent the villains a nice touch of pathos. A few key scenes were filled with anticipation and thrills. \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" brought together some unforgettable characters from yesteryear Marvel titles, especially Garfield and Maguire.The main fight scene in the Statue of Liberty was great and made the movie worth watching. Significant emotional elements played out there. They were well-crafted with notable throwbacks.It was 'strange' to see Dr. Strange not come with the 'make everyone forget Peter Parker' plan, and even stranger to watch him wait for Peter's permission to cast the spell when the multiverse was bringing a whole slew of villains to the city through cracks in space-time.The \"Venom\" pre-credits and \"Dr. Strange\" post-credits scenes held promise.\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" can't in all fairness be called the best MCU movie made so far, but any fan of the franchise will enjoy what this title brings to the multiverse.", "Very good and enjoyable. But top 20 of all time?": "This movie was a very pleasant surprise especially the latter half of it. It was great fanservice and the very fact we can see all those actors unite on screen is amazing.However it's a mess. A very enjoyable one but still a mess. It's obviously been shot separately with the actors not being in the same rooms due to covid but it still feels stiff at times because of that. Also the CGI is slightly undercooked as they probably worked on it all the way up to release day. The first act falls flat especially when you compare it to the rest of the movie.Overall this is a good movie however it has no right to be above movies like The green mile, Inception, Interstellar, Gladiator, Alien (1979) , Django unchained etc.", "Still speechless & can't believe it's true": "Andrew Spider-Man & Tobey Spider-Man together and all the nostalgia with all the villains you wished for ...

But when me and my younger brother watched this part of the Spider-Man series, we fell in love with it. It's the most appropriate version your kid could ever see.

I do truly believe the best way to label the film is as nothing but \"peak fiction\". Any MCU fan will deem this as another satisfactory film in the series and i'm sure after the films release, every Comic book store on earth was filled with embryonic joy. I read another review that claimed that this is what cinemas were made for and I couldn't agree more , the variety of emotions shared amongst every man/woman/child were truly sensed through everyone's reactions in the cinema.", "With great budget comes great irresponsibility": "This movie is a perfect example of how creatively bankrupt bigger Hollywood studios really are.For decades fans of certain IPs (especially superhero stories) have been complaining that Hollywood can't stick to the source material. So what does Hollywood do? In their typical out-of-touch manner they try and prove how they're \"hip\", \"down with it\" and \"know what's up\". On the blu-ray you even get an insulting extra feature where this bland and annoying voice counts down how much of the \"Easter eggs\" you got in the movie. If you are a true Spider-Man fan and see this, it would only make you laugh and cringe. It just goes to show that this wasn't really made by people who are interested in the original stories, but they felt like it would be a great selling point if they managed to half-heartedly attempt to convince you they did their homework. That is just the most disgusting approach to an audience I have ever witnessed. First of all, it seems to simultaneously try to be a critique of the way Marvel movies are made AND at the same time validate them for whatever reason (I mean it's obvious that the reason is profit and keep milking this cash cow).The first half of this movie is exhaustingly cynical in its attempt to be lighthearted (which it didn't need to be) and funny (which it also didn't need to be). And right about the middle it decides to awkwardly change the tone from an awful cheesy blockbuster to an authentic Spider-Man story with actually heartbreaking moments.This is why I can only give it a 5/10. Half of the movie I absolutely love. The other half I hate with a passion. It would've been much better if the movie was just bad, but no. They had to go all out with doing an incredible concept, incredible cast, incredible conclusion and then just dump some cheesy jokes (that also NEED to be repeated for some reason, doubling down on the awkwardness and cringe), appallingly needless exposition and \"funny\" moments that ruin the emotional impact of the narrative.This doesn't feel like your typical dumb cookie-cutter cash-grab Marvel movie. No, it goes the extra mile to make you feel like you're being scammed. It reads like an e-mail from a Nigerian prince that wants to give you a million dollars. You really want it to be true, but you'd have to be stupid to fall for that trap.I've always hoped Hollywood would somehow do better. With this movie, this hope is gone. Its pacing sort of reminds me of Hancock. But where I don't care about Hancock as a character, I certainly do care about Spider-Man. He is my childhood hero. And they completely ruined him.", "Infinity/10": "This is quite possibly the best superhero movie I have ever had the pleasure of watching. It is possibly a centimeter away from perfection. Nough said.", "Actually good": "All I can see in the reviews that it's overrated and overhyped, and people giving it 1 or 2 rating because of that. So it looks like it's actually underrated? It's a decent movie, I enjoyed it, some of the jokes are out of place, and maybe there's too much emotional/drama scenes, but I overall enjoyed this movie. It's a nice addition to the MCU. The characters are good, the acting is good, there's an actual story and not just random jokes happening like in Thor Love and Thunder, it's a 100X better movie than that. It's so far the best Marvel movie since Avengers: Endgame. I don't know what people wanted to see instead. Just the same story with a boring villain? At least this movie had an interesting concept, even if the execution was not perfect, but it was decent. I don't really know what else can I say? I liked it and I can recommend it to Marvel fans or if you liked the previous Spider Man movies you might like this as well. Well, basically that's it. I really don't know what else can I say, it's good, it's all right.", "Best spiderman movie ever.": "This is my very first review here . Am still emotional , the nostalgic feeling , the acting , the cast . It was a dream come true for all spiderman fans. This has to be the best spiderman movie ever, hands down. I was completely blown away . Its definetly on par with endgame , Dont believe any negative review, just watch it!!!!!!!!!!. 10/10.", "How did they manage it?": "The ninjas, cutting all those onions! If you have seen all the previous spider man movies then you know what i'm talking about.. if not, then go watch them!This movie celebrates them, and make then justice and it all comes together like perfectly coordinated dance that leaves you wanting more.", "The Amazing, Good and Bad.": "No spoilers until you see the warning.So this film is really hard not to like. It's really fun to watch, especially with a group of friends. The story is done perfectly but it could've been a little better if it didn't feel so rushed. Like I mentioned, yes this film is kinda rushed, like the pacing makes the movie feel an hour and it makes rewatches a bit dull. Anyway, the villains are good, except for the sandman and lizard who were so boring with honestly zero personality. Sandman's motivations don't really make sense but we'll get to that in the spoilers section. As far as the acting goes, they all have done a terrific job, especially Tom Holland and Willem Dafoe. There are sad and funny moments. The cgi is not very good in some of the shots and that's the biggest problem with this film, the bad cgi made me distracted but anyway let's get into spoilers. If you haven't seen it yet, go watch it, it's definitely worth your time.SPOILER WARNINGThe first act of this film is Peter dealing with the fact that his identity is revealed and it's just mcu comedy and stuff. They didn't really make a big deal out of it, and it felt like they just wanted to get to the multiverse stuff. The second act is slow and fast at times, and the bad cgi can be seen, and tbh the fight scenes the first time you watch them feel really cool, but when you rewatch the film they kind of feel weak compared to other ones, BUT this problem is only on a few parts of the bridge scene and the entire electro fight in the woods. When the fight with doc ock ended I was like, \"oh already?\", it was so fast. Peter finds out some of the villains die, so he fights Doctor Strange who doesn't care and just wants to finish this. The mirror dimension fight is actually pretty cool and Peter wins and gets the villains to Happy's apartment to cure them. He makes some of the cures until the goblin takes over Norman and brainwashes the villains into fighting Peter. Aunt May dies by gobby and says the iconic line \"with great power, there must also come great responsibility\". This fight was a masterpiece and Aunt May's death was emotional, cause Tom Holland nailed it in that scene and the music that was used made it 10x sadder. Then Andrew and Tobey appear and god the cgi is terrible, the portals looked so weird and fanmade. The entire movie's tone changes and the pacing becomes slow. All the Peters meet and the scene is just marvelous, pure perfection. But after this really emotional scene with them sharing their anger and grief in the past, the pacing goes fast. They make the cures and the final battle is fun but there is questionable cgi. The villains are cured but the spell is destroyed and Peter needs to make the heroic and responsible choice or the fabric of reality will break. Peter makes the choice to get everything about Peter Parker out of existence and be alone. Peter loses everyone and truly becomes Spider-Man. First of all, wow the ending is such a masterpiece and this is a satisfying conclusion to this trilogy, despite all the bad cgi and fast pacing the story itself is a 10/10 honestly, Andrew was redeemed and got the love he deserved since 2012, him saving MJ is really satisfying. Garfield's acting made it satisfying. Tobey was good, and the wise version of Peter that teaches both of them a lesson. Anyway this was a great conclusion to finish an origin story and get to the real stuff.", "wow! how did they do it?": "Whoever thought of the concept behind this movie deserves a raise and maybe an award too..but I think ending was lil bit meh.. it was expected.If the ending was different and not what they show, then it wouldve been the best marvel movie ever by far!!", "Exceeded the best of my expectations": "I went into this one expecting the worst, but came out of it being blown away. It brought so much nostalgia to me. Really good chemistry between a lot of the characters, and it also learned from the mistakes of past films (Spider-Man 3, Amazing Spider-Man 2) making each villain interesting in their own way. Really did something that no other superhero movie has done.", "An excellent super hero/action movie": "Seems like the latest Spiderman movies keep getting better. This was a really well written story that incorporated characters from all the previous Spiderman movies and it did it in a very satisfying way. I felt like not only did this have really emotional/satisfying ending it also seemed to add a little oomph to the older Spiderman movies as well, some of which I didn't really care for.I have watched just about all the Marvel movies and have been finding them shallow and boring without much heart (yes including End Game). This is one of Marvel's rare gems that I really enjoyed.", "The best Spiderman movie & D'best film in the MCU": "This is the coolest and the most amazing spiderman movie ever seen. I'm the big fan of spiderman since I was in elementary school and Spiderman No Way Home is number one after spiderman 2 (2004) for me.Watch this one on the big screen you'll never regret that. The movies was so epic and got me so many ghoosebumps.", "Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021, Jon Watts) A marvelous production feat disguises a plot with issues but finally Spidey feels like Spidey": "SPOILERS\nThere is no denying that 'No Way Home' is one of the more ambitious MCU films to date. We knew multiverse stories were coming and 'Wandavision' hinted at it a bit but didn't go there and 'Loki' explored it even further, but the first MCU movie to really crack into the multiverse concept winds up being this Spider-Man film. It was an inspired idea to not only bring in villains from previous Spider-Man films, but also to bring in the Spider-Men as well so we get Tom Holland fighting alongside Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. The multiverse angle is, without a doubt, the huge selling point of this film.What I am not too keen on is how they constructed the story to get to the multiverse. This film commences after the events of the previous Spider-Man film where Mysterio outed Spider-Man as Peter Parker. Peter winds up going to Doctor Strange who nonsensically agrees to cast a spell to have people forget he is Spider-Man. The spell goes awry and folks from other Spidey universes start filtering in. Then it becomes a battle to corral all the villains with help from the other Spider-Men and render them harmless before sending them back to their universe. Why this is supposed to help them when they go back I honestly don't know, but that is what we are lead to believe. In order to restore the universe Peter allows Strange to complete the spell having everyone forget who he is. This has the benefit of sending all the multiversal characters back to their appropriate home, but also leaves Parker in a very odd space at the end of the film with no Aunt May, and no friends and no Avengers/Stark support which Holland's Spider-Man has had throughout his entire run in the MCU. The semantics of that Doctor Strange spell baffle me more than anything, but like most comic book logic it is something you are just supposed to believe, embrace and move on. This does set up Holland's Spider-Man for more films in which he is finally more solely Spider-Man and not a child of the Avengers or Tony Stark which will be nice to see when the next film gets off the ground, and while Parker ends this film in a lonely, dark place I suspect it is only a matter of time before Peter's friends get their memories back. This film also serves as a fitting springboard to the next MCU film where Doctor Strange will be doing his own multiverse story. It was also nice to see them bring back Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock showing up here in what only amounts to a brief cameo but we can anticipate seeing much more of him in the future. This film is fun and energetic and a wild ride and eye popping in its ambitious scope. It is amazing to think from a production standpoint that they were actually able to pull it off.... Avengers assemble indeed. It is more like Spidey alums assemble. Story issues aside this was still a wonderful movie to experience that succeeded on more than a few levels.Eric's Grade: B.", "Could've been better": "So far all of Tom Holland's spiderman movies have great ideas that are not executed well and end up not satisfying. For people who watched NWH for fun and nostalgia, they will love it. But for me, it is of little value if the filmmakers' strategy relies solely on the return of beloved characters just so we can see them again.The script ranges from average to bad making the multiverse characters nothing more than plot devices or even just cameos. The idea is to make a script for which you don't use previously said things by the characters to make us aware that we are indeed seeing them, but taking the basis of their personalities and writing new lines where you don't underestimate not just their power, but their intelligence and wit, also. Because I didn't feel like I saw Raimi's Spiderman and characters, aside the Green Goblin. Most of the villains choose to stay in the universe just for power and if you haven't seen the previous movies, here you will think they are evil for the sake of being evil, while sandman just wants to go home. They say couple of lines because they are brought into this movie and have to say something. Nothing of that really adds up to the story, their dialogs are only brief info dump for the clueless, which also applies to the Spidermen's conversations. No matter what the fans say, I wasn't convinced by their bond especially since half of the script suffers from the usual unfinished sentences as a replacement for humor, bits of modern psychology advices and terms you see on instagram like \"boundaries\" and \"self-talk\" and characters not paying attention to details or caring too much what a person from another universe says or experienced, all camouflaged as a \"realistic 2020s conversation\".Andrew: You can shoot webs from your wrists?Tobey: You can't do that?Tom: (waves hands) Ok, anyways-Tobey: I fought an alien made of a black goo once.Tom: Oh great, I fought a purple one in space.Tobey and Andrew: Cool.Andrew: I fought a crazy Russian guy in a rhinoceros machine.Tobey and Tom: Oh, cool.You would think that the screenwriters who had this opportunity of realizing the comeback of iconic superheroes after so many years would write a more intelligent dialog. Despite the hype, I tried to stay aware that the crew is the same that wrote and directed Homecoming and FFH, which brings me to the fact that Tom Holland's Spiderman is the dumbest and most gullible Spiderman I've seen so far.I have nothing against Tom Holland as an actor or a choice for this role, but whoever writes his character, they've done such an awful job. Why? They focused so much on making him a gen Z kid and using him to mess up the story for the purpose of a conflict that they forgot to make him a Spiderman and Peter Parker, a huge problem in all of these movies. He doesn't care about people in general. I guess the comic book Spiderman is a bit douchey, but doesn't he learn eventually? In Homecoming he helped ordinary people so he can prove himself to Tony Stark, I don't remember if he actually did that in FFH, while he didn't even care about curing the villains in NWH. That was aunt May's idea and he even insisted on sending them back. He only cares about his future and protecting only the ones he loves like MJ, Ned, aunt May or Happy, characters I must admit are boring and I don't care about a bit. Neither they actually mattered in any of these movies, maybe Happy and aunt May who are not so bad, but they have sincerely no real importance except babysitting Peter Parker. Which is so different from the original trilogy's aunt May, a loveable, forgiving, supportive and wise lady who inspired wisdom in Peter in every movie and whose presence was not defined by sex appeal, and Harry Osborn who had his own storyline that was affected by the death of his father caused by Spiderman. Even Mary Jane which I liked the least felt part of the plot, while here MJ and Ned's whole personality is hanging around and being friends with Peter. Or should I simply imagine how close the actors are in real life and how much TomDaya love each other? I'd rather read the comics.Still, this isn't why I called him gullible.Spiderman identity is revealed and he is made a criminal by J. Jonah Jameson for killing Mysterio, who served mostly as a propagandist and a cameo. Daredevil, a laywer and again, a cameo, tells him everything will be fine and he will deal with it (we don't know how, but let's go with it) and that's it, now Peter thinks he has no problems and can care about going to MIT. But there IS a problem. *gasp* Wasn't it over yet? His girlfriend, friend and he are not accepted, obviously. Now he is more aware that there's still a problem. He goes to doctor Strange, acts like he makes a noble demand because a lot (four) people suffer from all this, talks a lot amidst the spell even when scolded not to and screws up the spell. Turns out they didn't need to cast the spell, he could've tried to convince that MIT lady to consider MJ and Ned for the college. He succeeds, but the spell brought people from other universes. On the request of aunt May that they should cure the villains, he traps Strange in a dimension so he will not be bothered by him and like he didn't learn from the accident with Mysterio... He openly talks to the villains about that Stark machine that can cure them and lets Norman Osborn freely use it. You can guess that everything goes downhill and Peter cries. If\nhe only paid attention when Norman mentioned that he is controlled by someone else or was smart enough to learn from his mistakes of trusting people too soon.Spiderman: No way home wasn't without things that I liked, loved or piqued my interest, but I couldn't expect more. I loved the idea of seeing the 3 Spidermen and their villains in one movie, maybe even just the villains, but not like this and not with the plot holes it opened. It got the desired success, yet it didn't leave me worried for the current filmmaking, at most, it sealed what I already came to terms with and that's not its bright future if it continues like this. You can ignore the rules of storytelling and characterization, play on nostalgia and other gimmicks and still achieve what you want. Marvel has a fantastical universe that makes me dazzled and goes beyond imagination, that's why I admit their success, but I understand people who say that they ruin filmmaking. Watching NWH reminded me how much I miss Raimi's trilogy and I need to stick to it as the closest thing we have of a comic book-accurate Spiderman story combined with good directing, characterization, script, memorable moments and storytelling.", "Without disappointment": "A very honest opinion. It was the best Spider-man ever made, thanks to the return of everyone in the other movies.For me, the 2h 28min passed very quickly, because you were very captivated by everything that was happening. They could have done it easily in 3 hours 28 minutes, I don't think anyone was upset.Tom Holland did his best role in the spider costume. It will be interesting to see a sequel because the ending left some puzzles. What will happen next?If you're a fan of Spider-man, you can't help but like the movie!

Of course aided by side characters who are too funny to be taken seriously, something Marvel is doing more and more since Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool.The movie is brave and entertaining, groundbreaking for it's choices.

Well, here goes!From the previews we know Peter has been outed and he seeks help from his work colleague, Stephen Strange. Well, that's not even an appetiser to what's in store throughout this fast-paced, action-packed, awe-inspiring, romance. Yes, romance!This film isn't about revenge, retribution nor retaliation. It is simply about love in all its forms. A complex emotion to visualise, hence the marketing gurus invented roses, diamonds and Mother's Day to define it, but love is like the COVID virus- it fluctuates, changes and adapts in many different environments!Peter's love for MJ, his aunt, his best friend, his powers, his Avengers friends are all different, yet still called 'love'. Well, through comic book metaphors 'love' has broken barriers, dimensions and heaps of hearts in No Way Home.Only in understanding that 'love' is a main character in this tribute can you comprehend the title and its deepest meaning.The acting complements the seamless and jaw-dropping CGI, Special Effects and Stunts. So in tune are they that you forget some things you saw weren't real!Peter's journey, although not yet complete, has definitely been through the wringers! All of Spider-man's incarnations have had their share of moral dilemmas, and yet this film surpasses all previous choices and redeems the actions of a true hero: one that puts other's wellbeing above their own. And if that is not love, I am perplexed as to what is!The only reason I gave it a 9 is because it lost a point for just bringing the boys back to play- no exes in sight!!The future of the MCU just took a turn that this avid fan anticipates will be even more majestic than it's reliance on an evil mastermind in its previous incarnations had achieved! I, for one, cannot wait for more!", "MCU's Magnum Opus?": "Spider-Man: No Way Home delivers the ultimate comic book story delivered so far in the MCU. When reviewing movies, pointing out gripes matters most when the gripes take away from the overall experience, I can safely say such a criterion does not apply to this movie.The biggest, most notable improvement and talking point about this movie is the story of Peter Parker and the presence of morality in this film. The events of the movie all act in service to the lesson taught to Peter Parker, and of course, the audience. We see Peter go through hardships and have the biggest role models to him tell him how and why he should still be the hero even the bad people deserve. This movie has it's themes set in consequence, responsibility, and self-sacrifice. Every thing goes wrong for Peter, yet in spite of it, the right people at the right time guide him to the moral truth. This culminates at the ending, with Peter's life effectively set to 0, no friends, no girlfriend, no superheroes knowing his identity. He's all on his own for the first time, at his lowest point in life, but we see that he still throws on his new mask, still swings through NY, and is still Spider-Man'ing.Throughout the movie, the classic villains do various heinous things to him, and we see the \"Man vs. Enemy\" struggle. At various points in the movie, villains like Green Goblin, Electro, Sandman and the Lizard jeopardize the already waning stability in his life, causing Peter great stress. This, along with the low public opinion of Peter Parker causes self-conflicts within Peter. The great takeaway from this is the \"Man vs. Self\" struggle presented subtly by Doctor Strange, and upfront by Green Goblin. Green Goblin tells Peter that despite how responsible him or his Aunt May want him to be, those with power don't conform to responsibility. This idea festers in his mind, which boils over at the end. Green Goblin kills his mother-figure in Aunt May, and Peter genuinely feels the desire to kill Norman Osborne, which is a VERY welcome negative-change arc for the character, considering the usual cookie-cutter every-man that MCU heroes usually are. This change leads to the other two Peters informing him on what's right, which is where MCU Peter cements his instilled lessons in his mind on what a truly responsible person must be, even if he doesn't want to be one. Anyone paying mild attention to the film should understand the lesson this movie presents to its cast and its audience, and should appreciate it, because it's slapped on our faces and handled so well.The comedy was great, though comedy is subjective so I won't delve too deep into what makes it funny. There's less quirky \"high school humor\" which is refreshing because the way the characters joked and acted in the first two movies was nothing like the average high school student today. There are various callbacks, various acknowledgements of absurdity, various memes that make the jokes stick, which is welcome.The villains were magnificent. The movie doesn't waste time or babysit the audience by explaining who each villain is in too much detail, and rather operates best when the supplementary movies and material are known/understood by the audience. As I said, the callbacks add to this effect, making it so that people who have these older Spider-Man movies fresh on their minds can think, \"Oh yeah, this did happen\" when something is referred to. The best thing about the presence of these villains is that they don't develop a personal aggression/relationship with Peter Parker. They act as the force of change for Peter's life instead, which is good because it doesn't feel like it was rushing plot points, or left parts of their relationships half-baked. This movie is 2 hours and 30 minutes long, and with 5(ish) villains, I don't think this movie would have benefitted from the Far From Home approach of making the beef personal. Kudos to the writers for understanding why it should be this way. The \"villain\" of this movie presents an interesting question to Peter, as they are seen numerous times doing heinous things to Peter and the world around them. That question is, \"Do the bad people deserve help?\" It's easy to say no for anyone else, but for Spider-Man (all 3), the answer is yes.1. Green Goblin: Genuinely the scariest interpretation of the character yet. We see him go from looming menacing threat, to cowering old man, to genuinely frightening villain back-to-back-to-back. He ruins Peter's life for literally no reason out of nowhere which worked so well in instilling fear in me. Aunt May does the right thing by offering him help, he gets taken in and helps out a bit with Peter on helping cure Doc Ock and Electro, then BAM. Crazy villain that destroys Peter in one of the most intense brawls, kills aunt May, and leaves the place smiling. Willem Dafoe cements his place as one of, if not the best Comic Book movie villain in history, as he is the first villain EVER to have me genuinely scared and heartbroken for the hero.2. Doc Ock: Doc Ock felt like a half-villain in the movie. He was like an appetizer for the fact we were getting all these old villains. His fight with Peter on the bridge was extremely fun, his humor was fun, and his insight on the multiversal situation was fun. He gets cured by Peter pretty early on, which is what people (myself included) wanted because it'd feel like character-robbery if Kevin Fiege just plucked him out of his universe and made him full-villain again. He then disappears, which is a gripe, but one that doesn't need much explaining. He comes back, makes the save, and proves his worth as a hero.3. Electro, Sandman, the Lizard: These guys were mostly powerful punching bags for Peter, there was no personal attacks on him, just conflict and general aggression. As I've said earlier, they work to service the plot more than service the characters, which I'm fine with.The fights were stellar. The fight with Doctor Strange was one of the best fights in the MCU. The fight with Green Goblin at the condo, and at the end were some of the best fights in the MCU. I don't need to say much more.Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's presences were VERY welcomed. Two Spider-Men were just the moral compass that Peter 1 needed to get back on track, and they have some genuinely emotional scenes together. Seeing the chemistry they all had makes me want them back in another movie, that's JUST how good they were together.There's so much more to cover, but I don't write for Oxford. 10/10 Super Hero movie. Not much else to say. Have a nice day, and remember, with great power, comes great responsibility.", "Am I the only one who laughed at the washing machine?": "Honestly when the rumors first started floating around about bringing back characters from previous films, I groaned. I thought back to Riddler/Two Face, Sandman/Venom, and a multitude of other superhero films that suffered from poor character development inherent to overstuffed-itis. In particular, Sony's executions have been poor. But I'm happy to say; I stand corrected. This was a beautiful \"endgame\" to all Spider-Man films from the past 20 years. And yet able to tie back to the very basics of the mythos which is that about how Peter deals with loss. Emotional? Yes. Jokey? A little bit but reasonably subdued. Action? Still a little hard to follow, particularly at night, but I've resigned to the fact that all Spider-Man action scenes are going to be like that. Most characters got a bit of incremental development. And while there was a lot going on, I'm happy to see that the film knew enough to focus on Peter Holland. I'm still occasionally wanting to yell at Peter Holland \"are you daft?\" but I acknowledge the writers knew enough to preempt that reaction in verbalizing that he's still just a kid. Overall, a beautiful bow to tie off three sub franchises.", "The great reviews": "The \"best movie ever\" type reviews come from those who only watch Marvel movies. Incredibly overrated.

I don't even know where to start. Peter cries to Dr. Strange about his \"reputation\" and Strange decides to cast a spell to help. Why would doctor strange care? Anyway...Peter screws it up and then all the villain's from other Spiderman movies come in. Alright no biggie, Strange tells Peter how to send them back to where they came from, simple enough. But noooo now Peter all of a sudden has to \"Save\" them? Seriously, what in the good name of hell is this bull all about? Are we that woke now as a society that we have to \"Save\" fictional movie villains from 15 years ago? After about an hour of filler crap the plot picks up again but instantly falls dead. His auntie bites the big one, but seriously, who cares? She is not even relevant in the MCU. She dates Happy and then for him to compare May to Ironman made me sick. But, that's irrelevant, just like May. After some inner turmoil ole Pete is tasked with vengeance and tries to \"kill\" Osborne. Another failed moment, and a different parker is stabbed by the bad guy. Again, who cares? By the end of this monstrous piece of cinema garbage I was praying for an ending so I could leave. In the end Strange is able to cast a spell that \"magically\" fixes everything. I mean he could have done this right after the first one was botched, but noooo, they made us sit through 2.5 hours of useless crap. This by far is the worst MCU movie I have seen up to this point.

Willem Difoe steals the show in these sequences.I said spoilers right so stop reading if your going to see this movie.With the multi-verse open the cream that sits atop the movie is the appearance of Tobey Maguire & Andrew Garfield as alternative Spidey's.

The major fight scene with all 3 Spider-Man really is a comic book readers wet dream!One of the highlights is a conversation about where Tobeys web fluid comes from. Hilarious.Back to the movie itself, it tries to be great and has great ideas but in the end it's just Spiderman and it's villains fighting it out. Don't get me wrong, it's good fun and an enjoyable movie.Tom Holland is a really good actor and is great in this. By far my favourite.

Journalists and onlookers do not give way, plus not everyone considers him a hero, which has an extremely negative impact on the quality of life of Peter, his girlfriend MJ and Ned's best friend.

Throwing all the fan service at your feet including the return of Toby and Andrew in their roles. Which... I didn't know when I went to see this movie.. meaning I did crap my pants a little in excitement when that happened!The movie does suffer a bit of the \"don't think about it too much\"It's hard to do multiverse, or time travel, or magic in a way that always makes sense from every angle. This entire thing started because of a messed up spell.. a spell to make the entire world forget that Peter Parker is Spiderman, and gets messed up because he wants a few to keep the knowledge.It's also mentioned that the spell can be used to eliminate quite specific memories, like a party that Wong had..\nSo.... why not... instead of making everyone forget who Spider-man is, make everyone forget what Quentin Beck said.. more specific.. it keeps the secret from everyone except of the people who already knew it before Quentin Beck said it.. Or discuss other ways to do the spell.. or.. at least.. spend 2 minutes discussing the spell and its perimeters instead of just going straight into it.And the whole \"fixing villains\" plot. Sure, it's in Peters' young and naive nature (helped by Aunt May). But there is no guarantee that it would actually prevent their death when you send them back.. So.. what's the point..Either way... it happened.It was great to see the old villains back in action. Great to see Toby and Andrew back in action. And this movie did a lot for them, especially Andrew. Providing a better \"closure\" to his arc than his own movies every did.. And hopefully setting up more of his movies.. And I also liked that this was a new way of setting up the \"New York, broke, friendly neighbourhood, spider-man for Tom Holland. Without the avengers and fancy gizmo's that Tom Hollands' Spider-man had since the beginnen that we know him... perhaps they'll move forward with that Arc too, which could be interesting for sure.Sometimes plot and story had to make way for some fan service. But for me it didn't really matter for the overall feel.. I had a very enjoyable time watching it. And have rewatched it a few times already.. plot wise, probably 6-7/10.. entertainment 9/10 easy. So averaging 8/10 for me.", "Everything you want in a Spider-Man film!": "Marvel/Sony you got my money worth from this film!! One of best theater experience I've had mostly because of the audience everyone was so engaged with this film everyone was truly a spider man fan and you can hear from pity the theater cheers tears and boos!! This is what you want in your theater experience and Marvel/Sony achieved it! Tom Holland finally became the spider man he deserved to be! And the rest of the cast was really top notch! Don't skip out on this film! Doubt anybody will tho!", "Blockbuster": "Sony and marvel have provided everything which we (fans) asked for. Watch this movie don't miss it. It'll worth every penny of yours. We can't compare this movie with endgame but surely it's not less than endgame. Better to watch on theatres.", "One of the Greatest Marvel Movies Ever Made": "This movie completely blew me away. I had been following the rumor mill and hype train for this movie for awhile now, and it still exceeded my expectations. This movie had so many ways that it could've been a mess, but it managed to handle everything perfectly. The first act was definitely a little all over the place, but once the spell went haywire, the movie kicked into high gear.Doc Ock showing up on the bridge and having his fight with Peter was excellent, and the little tease of Green Goblin was great too. Doc Ock looks identical to his Spider-Man 2 appearance, which still boggles my mind. The way that the spell worked and the way it pulled villains in made much more sense than it seemed in the trailers. Basically, everyone who know Peter was Spider-Man before should still know as opposed to just dead villains. From here, the whole chase after the villains was great, especially the sequence with Electro and Flint, who was just so confused. Then comes Norman Osborne, who absolutely stole this movie. Willem Dafoe knocked it out of the park as the Goblin, truly making him feel like the Joker of Spider-Man.The fight at the condo was excellent, and the way Norman just kept going and going was nuts. The death of Aunt May was absolutely heart breaking, and allowed for our Peter to go through an incredible arc. Then came the other Spider-Men. I love the way they were introduced, and the theater went WILD! Both Tobey and Andrew knocked it out of the park, especially Andrew. His character wasn't great in TASM (in my opinion), but he was great in this movie. One of the most entertaining, scene-stealing characters of the film. I love how they recreated the Spider-Men pointing at each other meme in a way that didn't feel forced. Any scene with the 3 Spider-Men was perfect, and absolutely legendary. So many iconic moments, especially the three swinging out and landing to face the villains. This final fight was just incredible, with so many call-backs and great moments. Andrew's Peter saving MJ was one of the most emotional moments of the whole movie, allowing that Peter to finally give himself some forgiveness for Gwen's death. The way the fight ended, with Peter (Tom) nearly killing the goblin, only to be stopped by Tobey's Peter was perfect, as it showed Peter (Tom) the true Spider-Man way.The way the movie ended was purely heartbreaking, with Peter having to say goodbye to the other Peters, and his best friends. This ending sets Peter (Tom) up to finally be on his own. Nobody knows who he is, so he's gonna have to start over and keep on going. I also love the way that Peter's new suit looks, with the bright blues and bright reds, it looks incredible.All in all the film blew me away, definitely becoming one of the greatest films of all time. I cannot wait to see what's next for Spider-Man.", "Fan-Girlin over the movie": "Me being a spiderman fan sincee the longest time, bottomline, it was anything and everything I could ever ask for.

Ludicrous plot with zero depth and awful acting makes it an annoyance to sit through for any length of time-it could barely sustain my interest even for the first 20 mins. And why does everyone in the movie have to crack a stupid,cringy joke everytime they open their mouths to say something-can't they be serious even for 10 god-damn minutes?! And what the hell is \"Scooby-doo this $hit \"supposed to even mean?! Its definitely one of the most egregious and annoying one-liners i have ever heard.All the glowing positive 5-star rated reviews on the internet were nothing but blatant LIES intended to hoodwink the public! Even reputable reviewers/media outlets have accorded high praise on this awful cr@p-fest of a movie. Marvel must have bribed the reviewers really well it seems,or the folks who reviewed it were probably half-wits who watched this movie with both or one of their eyes closed and thus they have no idea as to what it was really like.The experience of seeing this film can be likened to watching a cr@ppy bollywood movie full of stupid,moronic characters and a paper thin plot that makes no sense but fills you with an overwhelming desire to shoot the actors in their faces whenever you see them on the screen.", "no way home has less action and more emotions": "I don't want give any spoilers but this movie has best sequences action emotions last scene is literally made crying all superheroes and villain fight against each other that is why this movie earned more than other spiderman, when all spiders met eachother Andrew toby tom that was so sad moment for viewers because that is a biggest part of our childhood if i say anything it will be more spoilers for who didn't watch yet but this is the best movie of marvel series toby and andrew appearance brings lot of interest in this movie because their entry level is awesome all earlier villains came that was suspenseful scene and zendaya is very pretty and Benedict Cumberbatch has iconic performance\nthis movie deserves more than 10 starts \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50", "Forget Me Knots": "A 20 years journey brought us here , and what a masterpiece I've just watched !!! .

Parker feels guilty and wan't to erase that association with the help of Doctor Strange who whips up a dangerous spell that he tampers with, just because Parker keeps changing his mind, and accidentally opens up portals to other dimensions.I guess we can somewhat excuse a young and naive Peter Parker of coming up with such an dumb, thoughtless, hasty and dangerous idea, but the fact that Doctor Strange acts this nonchalante and stupid, who goes along with this and carelessly uses a very dangerous spell, and doesn't even cancel it when he notices how uncertain and wishy-washy Parker is - that's what makes the base of which the rest of the movie stand on so dumb. It kinda reminds me of the premises of 99% of all sitcom episodes where the issue could've been resolved in the first two minutes, if the characters wasn't so dumb.If we disregard the mostly unfunny banter between the Spider-Men, it was fun to see them all together and they actually used them well and had a purpose. They weren't just pointless cameos. And the movie was wellmade and pretty decent over all.", "No way Homey": "What an absolute load of rubbish!Marvel has decided to take the 'soapie' road home where tears & fears rule over the hero, and the storyline is guided by a constant flow of dumb decisions and obvious repercussions.It seems that Marvel is ditching its appeal to mature audiences and targeting the teenage market, such is the emotional & childlike drivel served up.How is it possible that a company with so much money can continue to write such poor stories.

It was like a power ranger episode from the 90's that would be a good animation ( maybe). The whole movie was a mess just because Peter was a bad boy. Someone should put him to it's place and don't tell me that the doctor tried. He made everything happen in the movie and I felt like he was like a joke throughout the whole movie. The only person who died was really not important, It died just for that famous phrase so it give some characters later something to say. They could help so many people with their grate minds in like half an hour. Bad guys are good guys then again bad guys who are actually good guys. So many silly moments that could just be cut off from the movie. And while watching it I felt like nobody really wanted to play in the movie.

Very week and forced story, only for the sake of nostalgia. After reading about all the hassle Marvel had, with getting Tobey on board, it really showed in the reel that he only did it for the cash to be able to support his poker addiction, and not really for the fans. Hell, he's right, why the hell would he enter this piece of trash anyway for less? This spider man doesn't do it for me, and I'm afraid the actor is approaching his saturation period, as also his height... He's the Karate Kid of the Spider Men, he's going to look like that for all of his life, no matter how many push or pull ups he does, he's going to look always like the cry baby that lost his parent's in the The Incredible... And then they cast him in Uncharted?? Holy S%#$. This movie was way longer than it should be, the story was rushed, the special effects were, Jesus Holy Christ bad even for a computer game standards, and they even recycled a scene from spider man 3 but the put it in reverse (the transformation of the sand man was the original but in reverse, the actor didn't even show up in the movie, only provided the voice)... Final rating, watch it on a Sunday afternoon on TV, for free!", "Full satisfaction": "Even if you are not Spider-Man fan, this is the good movie\nand for MARVEL Fan this Movie is Point movie, everything you want them to introduce is in this movie, Now it feels like Marvel after Endgame.", "The best MCU movie I've seen in a long time": "Beware: there are huge spoilers in this reviewBecause I could go on and on about how happy and excited I was about the appearances in this film, I am going to skip over the part where I have a huge nerd freak out (because I've loved Spider-Man since I was like 3) and just talk about the writing in this movie because I've seen people trash it and I don't actually think it's that bad (I actually think it's very good for a Marvel movie.) No hate to Marvel or anything, their movies usually don't have very good writing.1. Actually becoming Spider-Man: This was the biggest factor of the movie for me. For a long time we've had a heavy influence from Iron Man which led to this weird combo character where Spider-Man was also kind of Iron Man and while I loved those films I didn't like that aspect of it. This movie takes that factor and throws it in the garbage. Having Peter help the villains was the best decision for this movie because like MJ says, \"that's who he is.\" This movie is full of who Spider-Man is and why we all love him. He tries to help everyone even if it doesn't directly involve him because \"With great power comes great responsibility.\" Throughout the film he is trying to help MJ and Ned with no thoughts to his own happiness because \"that's who he is.\" When everyone forgets him we have Spider-Man on his own and we finally get the Spider-Man that we can recognize. At the very core of this movie is Spider-Man becoming who he is and I am glad we finally get to see it.2. Peter's character development: This movie has a very clear arc for Peter. Everything goes wrong because he want's the people he loves to remember that he is Spider-Man. At the end of the movie he is willing to give up everything that he was fighting for and have everyone forget who he is- a selfless act in a sea of selfish ones. By the movie allowing Peter to make mistakes- and big ones- the audience gets a chance to see Peter become who he needs to be. Before this movie there was a pretty big problem: how could they get Peter to go away from Iron Man and become Spider-Man? This is how. Peter Parker makes mistakes all the time, that's why people relate to him and that's why his journey is so satisfying. The ending to this movie is bittersweet but it is a perfect ending because we can see the Peter Parker that is familiar to us and we see him grow through his mistakes and become a better person, a selfless person, because of them.3. The story makes sense: Maybe it's just me but I remember watching the part of this movie where Peter has Doctor Strange cast that spell and I thought \"this is exactly what I would do.\" Peter wants the best for MJ and Ned, of course he would get Doctor Strange to cast a dangerous spell for them. Of course he wants them to remember him as Spider-Man, that was the way their relationships all grew. I will admit that there are some parts of this story that didn't really make sense- like why Doctor Strange didn't just wait for Peter to tell him the conditions before casting the spell, or why he couldn't add that MJ and Ned would still remember Peter during the spell at the end. But overall I think the story made sense for a teenager that just had his world torn apart.4. Every character has a story: Marvel often falls victim to one dimensional bad guy syndrome. All 3 of the Spider-Man movies squash that problem by making the villains somewhat like-able with motivations better than \"I want to take over the world\" (kind of with the exception of Mysterio, no hate Far From Home.) This movie turns that up to the max. The only 1D characters in this movie are the lizard and electro. Everyone else has internal conflict, everyone else has a personality. In a movie with this many characters that is hard to pull off, and it is very impressive.These reasons are why I think this movie has good writing. We see a character that actually struggles and develops, that has motivations that make sense, and that stays true to the source material. On top of all this we have all of the appearances, some very funny moments, a Spider-Man story with more consequences and higher stakes than ever before, great acting, fun fight scenes, and a great score. The movie also keeps to the story about Holland's Peter Parker, a difficult task considering everything that could of outshined him. At the end of the day the movie is still about him. Honestly, what else could you want from a Marvel movie?", "Masterpiece + best marvel movie made in history the credits are insanely unexpected": "This is all marvel fans needed and it showed us everything we wanna see idk what to say the movie is just completely mind blowing u should just watch it if u still didn't and don't skip the 2 credit scenes.", "Didn't work for me": "The first half was like some really terrible sitcom without laugh trackThe second half was like some TED talkFelt like watching chota bheem with kids where every little characters suddenly becomes professional and fights the villains of the dayHappy to see Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield playing spiderman again but other than that it had nothing to offer for me.", "Best movie ever": "Hands down the best movie ever how tobey maguire and andrew garfield came in and the final fight was just amazing and the ending when everyone forgets who peter is that was an amazing ending to the homecoming trilogy i cant wait for the spider man 4.", "Great movie, a lot of potential": "Awesome movie! Definitely one of the best marvel movies. And I think it deserves 9/10 rating - given how many people absolutely loved it. It is not about whether it's as Oscar worthy or equally quality made as Godfather, but whether it hit the right notes for the large part of the audience - which it did. If you put 1 ratings, just to lower the rating from 9/10 - that is just low life thinking, just enjoy a movie and put a real rating - from your perspective, don't try to counter attack \"marvel fanboys\" - because they put 10 due to how they feel about it.

Nothing further needs to be said and therefore nothing further shall be said.", "Better than I hoped": "This movie was so good. It ticked all the nostalgia boxes. It also reminded me just how good all 3 of the Spider-Man actors are. Spider-Man 3 almost made us forget how good Tobey Maguire was. He was a great Spider-Man. And because of how bad that 3rd movie was, we almost forgot that. And his role in this movie was just perfect. It makes me wish they made another movie with him in it. Andrew Garfield was so under appreciated in his role as Spider-Man. Both of his movies were only ok, but not because he wasn't good enough. He was really good. And the way they framed him in this movie gave him the redemption he deserved. And next to those two Tom Holland fit in perfectly. He wasn't outshone but he didn't diminish the other two either. He just simply cemented it in our minds that he was worthy to carry on the role. I just really want another Spider-Man movie from each of these 3 after watching this. So good.", "HOLY SH-": "This movie was incredibly filmed the cinematography was amazing! The story was best of the best probably one of my favorite marvel movies to this day, I loved how they brought back the originals. This movie was funny, action packed, and heartbreaking.

Anyway this movie was probably one of the best movies of Marvel definitely recommend watching it in theaters.", "Had a lot going that's for sure!": "I was pleasantly surprised and happy by all the cameos as well as the screen time they got. I did feel like the story line was a bit weak, especially in the middle with the whole repetitive \"spiderman just got duped\" for the bagillionth time but then it picked up again. The ending was great left me bittersweet and rather wistful.", "Spiderman and Dr Strange: No Way Home": "Movie was excellent for the most part. STRONGLY recommend watching the all the Sami Raimi spiderman and amazing spiderman movies leading up to this one as no way home is tied to those movies and a continuing of them to some extent. I did myself but I have movie amnesia and I forgot nearly everything that happened in those movies lol. It did confuse me seeing the other spiderman's bring up events and characters in their respective movies.No Way Home was literally unskippable, The MCU has always given us excellent \"3rd installment\" movies. See: Ragnarok, Civil War, Infinity War and now this.Seeing the 3 spidey's together is an all time great cinema moment. Dafoe stole the show as Normald Oswald and The Green Goblin with his masterful Hyde/Jekyll dynamic with a dash of Ledger's joker mixed in. Wish sandman had more screen-time. Luckily the other spiderman 3 is still around and the CGI holds up well even after 15+ years.The real problem with the movie is how much focus, emphasis, and reliability was on Dr. Strange. Peter went to Strange to fix the issues and went back to him to fix them yet again. Idk what the movie writers were thinking giving so much screen-time and power over the plot to another hero character that wasn't even the main focus of the movie. At times it truly felt like I was watching a Dr. Strange movie. Yes, I am aware Dr. Strange was trapped in another dimension for a period of time but that doesn't disapprove my points.Didn't help seeing Strange casually one shot one of the vintage spiderman villains when he trapped him in that glass thingy. Everyone knows Dr. Strange is several tiers above spiderman (their small tangle was plot biased in favor of spiderman as this was a spiderman movie after all) on the power scale and that scene proved Strange could have solo'd spiderman's rouge's gallery without much difficulty but the plot wouldn't let him for obvious reasons.That being said, the overwhelming influence Strange had over a movie that wasn't even his was briefly band aided when Spiderman trapped him in another dimension and the vintage villains and spidermans showed up and etc, but Strange showed up and saved the day once again. Now imagine if he was died in that dimension, everything would be screwed and spiderman by himself couldn't do anything about it but use talk no justsu to try to save and convince the villains to change for the better.Dr. Strange single-handedly created the movies plot and issues and he single-handedly destroyed it by the end of it. This is exactly why I think his name definitely deserves to be in the movie's title.", "If logic means something to you, don't waste your time on this movie": "The plot is just absurd. Very basic and drags on forever. You're left puzzled why it's made to drag on for so long, focused entirely on doing something illogical. One potential upside is you may find it satisfying if you have a strong memory of all past spiderman films. If you do end up watching this, you'll likely find yourself a bit bothered afterward, thinking - they could have just closed the story at 30 minutes, victorious. This was kind of a waste of time.", "Ambitious and entertaining Spider-Man film": "Spider-Man's identity is revealed and he asks Doctor Strange for help. Strange's spell goes south and Spider-Man has to face some known faces.The first half of the movie is intriguing and entertaining but there is too much to digest in the second half.

Spider-Man fans will enjoy it, even though some of the callbacks are uncalled for.The action is great and the visual effects are better than the previous Spider-Man films starring Tom Holland.Peter's character arc is great. He develops and learns a lot even with the multiverse stuff going on around him.The humour is inconsistent and sometimes out of place. Spider-Man and his friends are immature and not very intelligent. They do at times succeed in making the audience laugh, but there are many unnecessary jokes sprinkled throughout the movie.\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is overall an entertaining movie with few flaws. If you like the previous Spider-Man movies you will most likely like this one too.

So glad to see him back on screen. I'm curious to see what will happen next after the ending with Venom. Always great to see Tom Hardy too. Excited about the new Dr. Strange and Thor movie coming too. I hope they can top this one, or at least compare to it!", "'Spider-Man: No Way Home' Is The Most Satisfying Movie In Spider-Man's Trilogy !!!": "'Spider-Man: No Way Home' on the surface, the most ambitious live-action Spider-Man movie Sony Pictures has produced. As the No Way Home trailers have already revealed, the new Spider-Man movie brings together three eras of Spider-Man, with villains from Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's runs as Peter Parker jumping into the Marvel multiverse. We get Dr. Norman Osborn/ Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) from Spider-Man, Dr. Otto Octavius/ Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) from Spider-Man 2, Flint Marko/ Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) from Spider-Man 3, Curt Connors/ Lizard (Rhys Ifans) from The Amazing Spider-Man, and Max Dillon/ Electro (Jamie Foxx) from The Amazing Spider-Man 2. It's all happening - in one Spider-Man movie.This allows Spider-Man: No Way Home - from returning director Jon Watts - to take a nostalgic trip down memory lane, though I wouldn't go so far to say that it's standing on the shoulders of giants. To be fair, many of the villains No Way Home brings back come from some terrible (The Amazing Spider-Man 2) and forgettable (Spider-Man 3, The Amazing Spider-Man) Spider-Man movies. That said, Spider-Man: No Way Home does its best to cast them in a new light and redeem them as best it can. Dafoe and Molina naturally fare better, the latter being part of what is still one of the best superhero movies of all time. But though it might feel like the universe is expanding - we have a proper multiverse - really, the Spider-Man universe is collapsing on itself in No Way Home. There are no new characters introduced in this round.Spider-Man: No Way Home sends Holland's Peter Parker to some dark places, though it's never too far away from another crumb of nostalgia it can't dangle in your face soon after. It's like bits of pathos are mixed in with dollops of, \"Oh look, fond (and not-so-fond) memories of other Spider-Man movies.\" After all, there's the bigger matter of how this - the return of actors from old Spider-Man movies - all feels very much like a cynical commercial enterprise. Spider-Man: No Way Home ends in a slightly reassuring way that feels like Sony Pictures might be happy to put a lid on things, but we've always known that nothing is hallowed or permanent for Hollywood. They will dig up and exhume whomever they want, even if they must do so via hokey digital means.Picking up right where we left off in Spider-Man: Far From Home, we find Parker's regular life upending in front of his eyes. Cameras and attention follow him everywhere - he's the most famous person in the world now, we are repeatedly told - with some even coming for him, believing that he really did kill Quentin Beck/ Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal), the Far From Home holograph-specialist villain who presented himself as a dying hero to the world by manipulating footage. More importantly for Parker though, it's impacting the lives of those around him: his girlfriend MJ (Zendaya) and best friend Ned Leeds (Jacob Batalon) are rejected from colleges, and he and his aunt have to move homes to stay safe. Having had enough, Parker comes up with the worst possible idea.As you might have already glimpsed in the Spider-Man: No Way Home trailers, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange/ Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to cast a spell that would make people forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Set aside the stupidity around Peter asking for such a crazy favour - there are so many superheroes who have to live with the burden of their identity being in the open - what makes it more insane is how casually Doctor Strange agrees to his request. Strange waves off Wong's (Benedict Wong) warnings by saying they have used such spells for much tinier stuff in the past. Okay then. But invariably, things take for a turn for the worse after Parker realises that he's not properly conveyed his request: the spell Strange is casting will make everyone forget Peter Parker is Spider-Man. You know, including MJ, Ned, and May.Although it's easy to follow the film independently, knowledge of the previous Spider-Man films only enriches this sweeping experience. 'No Way Home' is undoubtedly the most crowd-pleasing Spider-Man film of all time. This celebration of your friendly neighbourhood Avenger solidifies the web-slinger as the most beloved Marvel superhero.", "Once in a generation": "It is one of those movies only p[ossible due to 20 years of previous movies. A true one-of-a-kind movie. In addition, it was just great. I'm not sure if it is a good movie without watching the previous toby and Andrew versions, but that is most likely the case,", "Amazing!": "It will fulfil everything you wanted and leave you without words. At the end you will still want more. I can not rate this movie enough. The rollercoaster journey you go on leaves you hyped for hours after.", "Disneyfication": "Awful from beginning to end with poor jokes and plenty of product placement, poor performances and jokes to boot.

Peter Parker is struggling with his new life, so he's trying to get his privacy back by asking Dr strange for help.I'm probably the last person to watch this piece of beauty ,but anyway I'm writing about it.It's absolutely entertaining, more than 2 hours of funny moments, emotions and memories.It was challenging to make the 3 spider-men together, but it's the source of the nostalgia that every spiderman fan had watching this one.It's full of surprises in terms of the characters, but spoilers made it looks normal and made me waiting for them actually, some painful surprises and good ones too in the story itself.And finally Tom Holland's character development is wat got my attention in this spiderman movie.The movie includes some good references from different old spiderman movies.Marvel did its best to make us happy, to make our fantasies and our imagination come true.And talking about production, soundtracks were fascinating, and I got no words to describe the visual effects but Marvel-ous.", "I wrote in a review that Holland was the best Spider-Man ever": "I wrote in a review that Holland was the best Spider-Man ever: I stand corrected, they all are and this Multiverse madness is absolutely mind-bending...", "This is more like a family reunion...": "...as it brings together past villains such as Dr. Octopus, Electro, Green Goblin, Lizard, Sandman, and a few other characters from past versions. They have returned thanks to the multiverse, an inter-dimensional portal accessed by the stern Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) in a spell gone awry intended to restore Spider-Man's (a winning Tom Holland) anonymity after Mysterio outed Peter Parker in Spider-Man: Far From Home.The multiverse functions as a Macguffin of sorts. It's the jumping off point for Marvel movies to do what they do best, and No Way Home doesn't disappoint, thanks to that tried and true formula of good-natured banter and giddy CGI set pieces. I liked how it taps into Electro's awesome power. I kind of imagined that Electro, played by Jamie Foxx, perhaps, and this is a big perhaps, could be a crime-fighting consultant in some future movie. And Willem Dafoe gave a tortured performance as Norman Osborn, fighting hard to silence the diabolical inner voice of Green Goblin.All Marvel pictures have non-preachy messaging. No Way Home touches on grief, vengeance, and also makes a case for humanity's redemptive nature.", "The most overrated movie of all time by fan": "Simple plot, normal action, not gonna big surprised at the ending, not very creative of directing style. Every actors' acting is always getting one dimensional style.", "It's so very good": "I loved this movie.It's a great job. We saw the meeting of the trio in one movie. It was a complete movie.

I recommend everyone to watch it as soon as possible.", "A Movie That Actually Wants To Reward The Moviegoer!": "...and doesn't preach at ya for being such an awful human being, etc! Imagine that! And see, it made money cos it wasn't woke and gave the fans what they wanted! I was so thrilled and surprised to see Toby McGuire too cos somehow I'd avoided all the rumors regarding this release and man, it was just like when we got to see Luke Skywalker in The Mandalorian!I was upset that Aunt May died but I guess it was to evolve the character of SpiderBOY to SPIDER-MAN! And Tom Holland def brings this to life!See, it isn't that difficult to please the masses Hollywood. Just have a coherent storyline that jives with previous movies' storylines and never forget character arcs. The beautiful nostalgia gift we get in this flick would be a big yawn if it had not been against a background of an actual plot and actual character development. Thank you very much SONY!!", "Teenage bravado": "I thought Far From Home was bad, this is worse. It was painful to sit through. Peter, a know-it-all teenager, decides he's going to do whatever he wants with no mind to the consequences. Which I suppose is typical of teenagers these days. Forget listening to people with decades of experience when you have ignorant teenage bravado.MJ continues to be an absolute idiot, like mouthing off at Dr. Strange for Peter's ridiculous actions. Throwing bread at alternate Spider-Man who \"respects\" her for being so distrusting? How incredibly stupid, but hey, let's empower stupidity. It's the thing to do in this day and age.Now Ned with no training can all of the sudden effortlessly do magic? Oh and then let's add in multiple group shares about feelings and throw in a good cry with all the Spideys. Who green lit this junk?Once again we see the writers have absolutely no idea how a multiverse works. Could someone please talk to a scientist just once to get some reference?", "IMMA CRY MY WAY HOME!": "Ever since the trailer came out, there was so much skepticism, will they really bring back the OG Spiderman? Is it just the villains? Will the multiverse stay intact? What about the goofs? Well, MCU got that Big Brain energy so yes, they can create magic. So no, Avengers Endgame wasn't the only multi-dimensional masterpiece.I've been watching these movies for years now and oh that nostalgia hit goood. I had on an ear-to-ear smile and felt so proud watching it. It lives up to expectations. If you haven't been following up, you've got a lot to catch up on, there are some great recapped YT videos if you are short on time. I can't put it on paper, so YKIYK.No Way Home isn't just a movie, it's a feeling.", "All things find their way home.": "I would say people were longing for the next chapter of Spider-Man after the end of Far from Home. Not to mention the last two years of COVID-19 made people even more wanting for the third chapter of the new MCU Spider-Man movie. Well the wait is over and... Holy !#!$ did Marvel deliver.I will say this. If you are fans of the Sam Raimi/Toby Maguire Trilogy and the Marc Webb/Andrew Garfield duology, you will love No Way Home.The bringing together of new & old characters worked for this movie and the attention given to the comic book lore is commendable.If you haven't seen it yet, go see it. I swear you will not be disappointed. And be sure to stick around for the two post-credit reveals. Love you, Spidey. Keep on swinging.", "What a stupid movie": "They literally had no story. Just made the movie unnecessarily. Dr strange act as his servent, does what spider says. Dr strange was trained hard to make portal and the fat man make it easily without any prior training.

Pathetic.", "STRAIGHT TRASH": "95% Rubbish. 5% Action.The 90's Animated Series is a better watch than this 2021 crap.I notice Marvel superheroes barely wear their costume mask in these movies.The Green Goblin wasn't even in his mask. Just Willem Dafoe face on a board. I prefer to see the Superhero and Villains in their mask than to see the actors face for the majority of the time. I hated seeing Robert Downy Jr face the entire time while in his Iron man outfit.Outside of that, the jokes are lame, super corny one liners, and they become too overbearing.They struggled to stitch the 3 spider-man figures together.Stupid storyline.As other Users have said, how could this apartment become a high tech lab producing cures.

So everyone sets out on a grandiose therapy session which involves a lot of death that's apparently justified automatically.The problem with this piece of crap writing getting good reviews, is that they will just keep making more...", "Why does it seem as if Marvel is trying to dumb down all of their franchises?": "Why does it seem as if Marvel is trying to dumb down all of their franchises? This film has nothing like a cohesive story. Sections of the story, and locations are disjointed, and adrift without continuity. Jumping from one weird scene to another, I found it nothing like the heroic stories of the first few Spider-man stories. Those stories followed the characters through their lives, and we travelled with them on their great adventures.To me it seems like they want to make the characters ridiculous, without any nobility of character. Mere two dimensional cut-outs of super heroes. I found it very hard to get past the first few minutes of the film due to its superficial story telling character.In the Golden Age of Marvel Stan Lee created heroes with great character, and villains of endless greed, and spine chilling evil. Comparing this film to Spider-man 1 to 3 illustrates how far their film making has fallen.Is this due to the people who now control Marvel? Almost all of the films from Marvel of recent years have been utterly uninspired. Give me the inspiring heroes of the past, not this Woke Drivel.", "Amazing... masterpiece.": "One word... amazing.....enjoyed every second of the movie........nd...it is greater than previous movies. Trust me.moreover, this movie is also very emotional for marvel fan.", "No real scenery anymore, just cgi.": "I don't really like Tom Holland but who writes spiderman like this. Egocentrical, self-serving and stupid. All these shortcuts, Ned Leeds has magic talent and without effort uses Strange's spells. Guess i'm not the demographic for these movies anymore, too long and modern idiotic characters.", "Spidey Spidey Spidey": "Whoa what a movie.This should be hailed as a spectacular success. It is a visual buffet, the audio effects are amazing but its the script and the story that lead the way.What a great story, the merging of all the Spidermen and their villains is so well put together.The film is full of joy and heart.Has a few moments it borrows from Star Wars (Luke and Vader).All smiles here :)", "It's not a movie, just the latest in a greedy franchise": "God, shoot me before I have to watch more of this Marvel crap! It's nothing but comic book characters against green-screen shots that cheapen real actions and numb you. Spider Man is not a thoughtful movie that begged to be made, but rather the latest entry in a mindless mega-franchise that's designed to shake ten bucks out of your pocket. If you watch it, they'll just make another and fleece you again.", "A dream came true!": "As a big first generation Spiderman fan, I never thought that this day would come! Not only Dr Oc, The Green Goblin and Sandman return, but their existance has a true contribution to the plot of this film. They are treated from a different perspective as the lost souls who can return home. Tobbey is finally back! And Andrew too! The interesting part is that they have not only reprised their roles, but they have matured and evolved. Generally, I don't care about any inconsistances, this film was epic!", "Exceeded expectations": "As a movie it is a marvel and it is historical, it is entertaining, it has a very good treatment where it kept me euphoric and with a lot of tension. Too many surprises. I saw drama, which is what I needed in this kind of film. Positive character development. I feel that it had a lot of pressure to limit the duration, I feel that they put together several scenes in one to fit as much as possible.Very good photography, the script is good. The soundtrack is fantastic. Using great composers such as Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer, Michael Giacchino, which contribute greatly leaving their mark. A wonderful work of direction of actors, they transmit much body and with their expressions.", "This is the greatest MCU movie ever after Endgame!!": "\"I will not spoil anything for you\"This movie really exceeds our expectations. If you can watch this movie in the theatres without getting spoiled your mind will blow up. Of course dont forget to bring tissues in the theatre.

The chemistry between characters are top notch. There are some awesome comedy scenes too!!Overall the movie is great. If anyone seeing this review and hasn't watched the movie yet ; Please don't wait. Your mind will blow if you can watch the movie without spoilers. This movie is solely made for theatres. If you wait to see it in home then you will be missing a big important event of your life.Bonus tips : Don't miss the mid credit and end credit scene. I will not say anything about mid credit scene because it will be a spoiler but in the end credit scene they gave the teaser of \"Doctor Strange : Multiverse in the Madness\"For me this movie is really 10/10. I don't think anyone should miss this movie. Otherwise you will regret later.", "A little above average": "I don't often watch superhero movies. I hadn't seen a Spider-Man flick since \"Into the Spiderverse\" (the animated one), which was good, and before that I hadn't seen one since \"Spider-Man 3\" with Tobey McGuire. I completely missed Andrew Garfield's turn as the character, and hadn't seen Tom Holland before either.Some of \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" reminded me why I'm not that interested in these types of movies. As always, it's too long, and the special effects don't impress me. When was the last time you were genuinely impressed by special effects in a movie? For me it was some time in the early 2000s. Also, I never find superheroes particularly interesting as characters. Batman is perhaps the most interesting because he's a tormented, almost anti-heroic figure. The X-Men are also among the best because of the whole \"anti-mutant discrimination as a metaphor for racism\" thing. But Peter Parker? His unflappable, wholesome boy-next-door thing keeps threatening to get old.The other characters unfortunately were no more interesting. Sam Raimi was able to make Peter Parker, Aunt Mae and MJ feel like real people. Here they're really just stand-ins.There were some things I liked about the movie though. At about the half-way point something I'd never seen in a movie happened: the other actors who played Spider-Man appeared in this one, as did most (all?) of the villains from all the other Spider-Man pics. This finally got me invested: seeing them all interact with each other was interesting. I was going to give it a six-out-of-ten for that, but then the movie ended in a scene that actually felt kind of emotive, and to cap it all off, De La Soul were played over the end credits. So I had to bump it up a point for that.", "A perfect spiderman movie": "The first two two spiderman movies were more like ironman jr. And the movies was weak at being emotional and the plot was very light hearted. But, this one is a perfect spiderman movie. It shows the consequences of being spiderman, as the green goblin says in this movie. \"No good deed goes unpunished.\" And spiderman is a superhero that works alone and makes his costume on his own. This movie showed that even though almost for the half of the movie it relied on stark tech suits like the upgraded suit, and the iron spider suit. Also, peter meeting other spidermen and learning from them was really awesome. Even though the first 1 hour of the movie was very messy and has a very cheap plot, I believe this was the perfect spiderman movie.", "\"I Want You To Tell Me When You See Me Again.\" - Three generations of Spider-Man, where it's all about the power of love and responsibility": "A trilogy conclusion of incredible emotional power, which brings together entire cinematic universes and periods in a work unprecedented in the history of cinema, Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic love letter to films by Sam Raimi and Marc Webb, as well as those starring Tom Holland, which also comes full circle both with Sony's Spider-Man Universe and the licensing agreement with Marvel Studios, while opening the door to the next adventures of Spider-Man. Only in our wildest dreams could we have imagined such a feat being achieved while becoming one of the best superhero movies ever made. Benefiting from all the skills and passion of its cast and crew, it sets a milestone and also marks the best Marvel movie of all time.This especially since this brilliant twist on two decades of Spider-Men movies doesn't have an ounce of propaganda and/or messy storyline that plagues some MCU movies: It's a gem, with nothing but substance and heart! And, precisely because Peter Parker/Spiderman has too much of a good heart and believes he can change fundamentally bad people, he loses everyone close to him in one ultimate sacrifice.\"With great power comes great responsibility\" seems to make love impossible for Peter Parker again. One more bittersweet ending in Peter's existence, which made Zendaya say she would have liked to see Peter and MJ go to college together. Indeed, what fan could disagree with her? Who isn't heartbroken and hoping for our college sweethearts to be reunited in the next chapter of their life? By the way, is there any petition for Spider-Man 4 storyline to reunite them as Zendaya wanted for the ending of No Way Home?In the meantime, we should be able to dry our tears a little with the confirmation of the engagement of our two lovebirds in our part of the multiverse, right?Spider-Man: No Way Home is about real friends teaming up and true love. Essential values that make it a major and unforgettable cinematographic achievement.I saw it in theaters in January and now on DVD, for the second time, and it's still a shock that makes me shed seas of tears.", "Goosebumps": "Marvel did it again, gave us another masterpiece, in my opinion this movie is the BEST spiderman movie, 100/10... The acting, the CGI and the plot was AMAZING..Well done Marvel \ud83d\udcaf", "if you are not a fan of superhero movies but think this might be worth a go because of the ridiculously high ratings. Don't be fooled. Its just the same fare as all the rest.": "The MCU is the most overrated set of films on IMDB. Upvoted massively by fanboys to distort the ratings. The 2002 Tobey Maguire Spiderman was a classic. The 2nd and 3rd of that trilogy, and the Andrew Garfield ones were by and large lacklustre. I am not a fan of the new MCU but I keep checking in hoping that at some point they will actually start to be good films. The new spiderman trilogy is sadly the same as all the rest. Mindless rubbish. I can't even tell you what the story is. There's so little substance. And it's such a shame in this one because Zendaya is a wonderful actor and her chemistry with Holland believable and real. But we barely get to see it. It's just a load more spectacle and blast of visual effects without substance. I would love for a Marvel fan to explain to me how this film or any other of the MCU affected them on an intellectual, emotional or spiritual level. I just don't see how they can as there is so little human substance. And if they can't effect you deeply then why do people like them so much. I just don't get it.", "The perfect Spider-Man movie": "Like most, I was hyped for this film to say the least. And after Black Widow (which was pretty good), Shang-Chi (which honestly was pretty great) and Eternals (not great at all) didn't make my inner Marvel nerdiness implode, I was hoping that this could deliver. And it does that, and so much more.After some recently mediocre CGI that we've gotten recently from Marvel, there were some pretty incredible effects here. And I didn't notice an overuse of CGI on the Spidey suit like in Homecoming and Far From Home, so that is of course a positive. The acting here is superb, with Tom Holland giving it his all as always. But some standout performances I found most appealing was Zendaya as MJ and Marisa Tomei as Aunt May, they both give great performances, which is great as they never really got their standout moments in the previous two Spidey flicks. I also really enjoyed Jacob Batalon as Ned here, even more than I already did. He may not have mechanical arms or a red and blue suit but he still has a great presence. Overall, it was just incredible seeing these iconic villains back on the screen after not seeing the Raimi villains for over 10 years, and not seeing the Webb villains for a while too. And as usual, stay after the credits. Please.As for some negatives, I really can only think of one. And that is that I think that Lizard was definitely overshadowed by the other villains, and to be honest, he was the villain I was least excited to see again. But it was still great to have him back.No Way Home is the latest and most crucial Marvel film since Endgame, sure to live up to the hype. It even made my usually quiet British cinema clap at a certain scene. Would recommend to...pretty much everyone.", "Felt like someone's fanfiction": "I understand this movie is getting heavy-praise right now and you're probably already thinking of downvoting this, but at least hear me out.I'm a big Spider-Man fan, and I genuinely enjoy most marvel movies. I don't think I consider too many of them masterpieces but they're enjoyable. I went into this movie wanting to like it, but instead what I got was a story that read out like someone's fanfiction without much else to offer.Don't get me wrong, the film's fine enough. There are some funny jokes and it does feel good to see Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin and Alfred Molina as Doc Ock again, but not much else than that. Peter and MJ's relationship feels very cookie-cutter and at some point you get tired of hearing washed-up actors talk about their old films.It's not a bad movie, but highly overrated and everyone really needs to calm down over it.", "Awful, even with it's weak attempts at nostalgia.": "I knew this film wasn't gonna work, since once again they've overstuffed another Spiderman movie, sigh... these clowns never learn. The humor is the worst part of this film, and it's so cringe and forced, especially when they subjugate the Maguire and Garfield villains to it. Then they throw Maguire and Garfield into the mix to, which makes it even worse.There's more stakes in this film which is good, but by now I just don't care, since the last two films have been so safe and snuggly that I've felt nothing for the entire journey. They use Doctor strange well however, and since some of this film happened in the comics they deserve some credit for pulling it off. But most of the movies premise is weak, and it's battles are all dull and anti climatic, especially the final one.MJ and Ned are once again a nuisance, and they continue to make me miss the days of the real Mary Jane Watson, as well as Harry and Gwen. This Aunt May hasn't improved either, but you can't improve a character that will always look like a model instead of an Aunt.", "Very stretched and boring": "Warning: SpoilersI loved that the earlier Spiderman heroes appeared again, and that interaction was good. Else, this was a very boring and stretched film. The thing about Maths overpowering superpowers was silly too. All the actors acted very well, but the premise of the film was comical. I liked the spell-scene which showed the limitation of 'spells'. I hope creators show their normal, day-to-day lives too, instead of clubbing multiple characters together. Spiderman has superpowers but is also desperate to enrol into an elite college? Isn't saving lives enough for our wunder-kid?", "Exhilarating and exciting": "The most exciting and exhilarating Spider Man film ever. Gives chills and nostalgic feel. Spiderman is not a character, it's a feeling and the director has curated a movie with such love and bought spidermans from other movies in a good manner that it wins heart. My take, 10/10.", "Probably the best of Marvel till 2022": "Amazing script adjoining multiple verses of Spiderman saga. This one's probably the best sort out script of Marvel so far... Last 30 minutes will give goosebumps to the 90's kids.", "Pros and cons": "This is definitely one of IF not the worst comic book movies I've ever seen. The movie contains a plot that can easily be avoided with basic common sense. The effects at times were awful, the movie quickly wraps up it's first plot in favor of the \"Multi verse\" plot. This movie needed to rely on fan service half way through. Peter & Strange were completely ruined in this movie. This movie ruined the villains from franchises that came before it. An example would be electro, believe or not he was decent is The Amazing Spider-man 2. In NWH he's not acting like himself. Sandman was completely butchered in this movie. Sandman had a reason for what he was doing. In this movie he goes evil for no reason, it's not even explained it just happened. The acting is mediocre, almost everyone gave a weak performance. The one shining star in this whole film is Tom Holland himself, that guy was the only one pouring his heart out into this movie. If you like mediocre movies that only have fan service to back them up, this is the movie for you.", "I think there's no argument left.

They really brought the Movie up to another level.2. Doctor Strange and his universe are so good, bringing it into the Spiderverse was a Visual delight.3. The Action Scenes are so good.4. Jamie Foxx. (Very Funny Joke in a particular scene)5. Willem Dafoe.6. Otto Octavius.What A performance from these guys.The Audience had a Blast with this one and it was a Full Cinema, 2 particularly loud shouts happened in the cinema and I think you know what they are.19 Years Packed into one Movie. Endgame was only 11 Years.Amazing movie and the Dialogue between THE 3 Characters Was so good.", "Sorry, more excuses to make a movie than a movie worth watching!": "Apologies to all you folks out there that seem hell bent on making this sound like a great movie, but seriously; it was really a mediocre movie!It lacked so much, took vast circles, then some ludicrous twists that it leaves you wondering whether this was story that was written, or simply made up as they went along. Don't get me wrong, the CGI was amazing, as is the case for these types of movies but, did it make up for the cringe fest that it rapidly became.I like Tom Holland, he is a good actor, no doubt, the 'Benedicts' are awesome actors, but no amount of brilliance can substitute for a diabolically stupid plot.Synopsis: it was Daddy Daughter night out and my daughter really wanted to watch this movie, so it was 100% worth the watch, just to see how much she enjoyed it, but as an older viewer I was expecting some modicum of entertainment but soon found myself wondering what the heck was going on! It just felt like a 'movie made for the sake of making a movie' and I since heard that they had to make this movie to retain the rights, if that is true, then it kind of reinforces my opinion of it.", "I wish I loved it": "This is coming from someone who's favourite movie is Spider-Man 2.The hype for this movie was immense, having the opportunity to see classic villains like Alfred Molina's Doc Ock and Willem Defoe's Green Goblin was a dream come true. However, I was sceptical; I wasn't a fan of the past two entries of Jon Watt's Spider-Man, sure they were fun movies, but they weren't what I was looking for, they weren't truly 'Spider-Man' movies. No Way Home dares to be a 'Spider-Man' movie and fill what was missing in the past, but falls short of the highs of the Rami Trilogy and Into the spider verse.What made Rami's trilogy so special was how relatable Peter felt; Spider-Man 2 clearly grounds Peter in the real world with real problems that we can relate to, but I've never felt this way with this iteration of Spider-Man. This movie does give Peter a struggle, gives him choices that have consequences but some stuff just didn't sit right with me.Aunt May's death showed that Uncle Ben meant nothing to this Peter, that he wasn't truly Spider-Man until this point and this is a sort of origin story, which is an interesting spin on things. If only Aunty May was developed in the past movies for her death here to mean something here; in the past she was just the hot aunt that was fully supportive of Peter being Spider-Man, no conflict what so ever. They try to make her Peter's moral compass but it's just not enough for it to have an effect and left me feeling hollow. Spider-Man PS4 handled Aunt May perfectly in a way No Way Home couldn't. But Tom Holland gives his best performance as Spider-Man and that deserves credit.I can see that bringing in villains from the past is fan service, only Green Goblin has an emotional impact on Peter, the rest serve no real purpose but to get reactions from the masses. They also never feel like they're in the same room, which kinda bugged me.Now the Peters. Of course I'd be happy to see Tobey and Andrew. Little moments like Andrew saving MJ and Tobey standing in from of Norman's glider felt real. The scene when they all talked about their grief was powerful, Andrew being a standout. But the constant jokes, call backs and references just killed me; I've always had an issue with tone in MCU movies, but No Way Home makes it such a problem.This movie is doing so well because it's standing on the shoulders of what came before. A snake eating it's own tail. The movie feels like it was made by a corporation and not the vision of a filmmaker. I miss the days when practical effects were used, nothing felt tangible. There is some great memorable cinematography here (the hallway fight scene) and shot composition, which was missing from the past movies, I wish we got more of Jon Watt's artistic vision and expression.The ending puts things in a great place, Peter finally on his own, not able to rely on people like Iron man and Doctor Strange. Putting him in a crummy old apartment facing the consequences of his selfishness and being the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man. A perfect set up for a smaller scale, intimate Spider-Man story, which I hope to see in the future.No Way Home doesn't have the heart of the Rami movies or the love for Spider-Man that Into the Spider-verse had, but it's a movie that was made to please the most people and I'm fine with that.", "Spider-man: no way home": "Before all of the hype I wanted to see Spider-Man in the theater, and the hype just made me want to see it more. I didn't know what to expect, but I certainly expected better than what I saw. Besides being a snooze fest, it was so sappy and saccharin I scheduled a dentist visit during the movie.The movie started going wayward the moment Peter Parker (Tom Holland) went to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for a spell to make everyone forget him. It wasn't a bad idea for Peter to go to Doctor Strange to fix his little revealed-identity problem, it was just oddly dumb of Doctor Strange to actually accommodate Peter. Doctor Strange truly attempted to make everyone in the world forget who Peter Parker was. It was a massive spell that seemed very excessive just to fix one man's problems. The movie went into silly mode as Parker kept interrupting Doctor Strange as he was doing the spell. The result was a host of old nemeses from different universes converging upon this universe to find Parker. If it was explained, it was explained poorly.At this point the movie was on shaky ground, but it hadn't given way. \"No Way Home\" would suffer another setback when Parker fought Strange to prevent him from sending all of these villains back to their respective universes. You see, if they were to go back then they'd meet death at the hands of, or because of, that universe's Spider-Man, and this universe's Spider-Man was way too moralistic to allow that to happen. No, Parker would fix it so that they could all go back home and they could all live happily ever after.Everything after this part of the movie was immaterial to me in the grand scheme. For me, when a plot is based upon a faulty or simply bad premise, everything that follows is equally faulty and meaningless. Not that the things that follow can't be cool aesthetically; they're just empty.Parker was operating upon the righteous advice of his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). Per her wisdom, Parker had an obligation to help these poor misguided men, no matter what the exponentially more knowledgeable Doctor Strange said. Doctor Strange wanted to do the most logical thing which was send each villain back to his own universe and let fate take over from there. Parker, with his oversized heart and undersized common sense, wanted to keep them in his own universe as pet projects until he could fix them, then send them back. Nevermind that he was going to be actively tampering with the course of events of another universe thereby massively altering their timelines with untold consequences, he simply wasn't old enough, wise enough, or experienced enough to know what was the best thing to do. Furthermore, it was a slap in the face of the other Spider-Men. As if to say, \"You guys screwed up, I'm going to find a better, more wholesome solution because I'm a better Spider-Man\"I was so thoroughly perturbed by this new mission of Spider-Man's to save these villains that everything after that began to annoy me. The attempts at comedy were awkward and grossly unfunny. The emotional moments were too often and too long. The final nail in the coffin of this was the runtime. Boy did they drag this out. I could put up with a didactic and flawed plot if you get us through it in a quick and exciting way, but in their attempts to have this grand send off for Spider-Man we had to suffer through an ocean of tears, a chasm of emotions, and an abundance of silence with slow music. I left the theater drained and upset as though I'd just been to the DMV. Everything was set up for them to reboot Spider-Man if needed, but at this point I could use a break and no more Spider-Men about \"home.\"", "great movie": "To me, this is better than the finale and even all the other films of the square. It brought me back to childhood, united eras and gave the right to all three spiders to exist, even in different worlds. Super Film That Reaped a Sea of Emotion.", "Best Tom Holland Spiderman": "The theater we were in gave standing ovations and cheered the loudest I have ever heard in a movie. Two surprise characters make an appearance. I hope that Tom Holland gets a few more cracks as Spiderman in the MCU.", "Good but not great!": "I love Tom Holland as spiderman aka Peter Parker he has never been disappointing. Willem Dafoe did also an amazing job(as always) and most of the rest actors did too. But if you focus in the movie a lit more, you will see how overestimated it is. There is no plot, there are many plot holes, it has serious pacing issues, it constantly repeats itself, it's really predictable. All in all, it is wrong. This film is a fan service project that had a huge success because of the nostalgia and the hype and that's all.", "This has an Avengers style grandiose epic feel to it": "Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched in the movies. The storyline follows post Civil War activities when the world discovers Peter Parker is Spider-Man. He approaches Dr. Strange about removing people's memories of him but while Strange is casting the spell Parker interrupts him causing Strange to make a mistake and open a vortex to multiple universes letting in Spider-Man villains from other universes. Can Spider-Man catch the villains and send them back?This movie is directed by Jon Watts (Spider-Man: Homecoming) and stars Tom Holland (The Devil All the Time) , Zendaya (Dune), Benedict Cumberbatch (Star Trek: Into the Darkness), Willem Dafoe (Platoon), Jamie Foxx (Ray), Alfred Molina (Boogie Nights) and Marisa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny).The special effects in this are out of this world as you'd expect from a Marvel movie. The storyline is clever, unpredictable and just the right level of complex with plenty of surprises sprinkled in throughout. The dynamics of the characters are very well presented and the ending is clever and well done and closes the trilogy perfectly. Defoe delivers an incredible performance and this is easily my favorite presentation of Green Goblin yet. All the villains are well done, to be honest. The cast overall does a fantastic job in this picture. This also does a great job of weaving in the holistic Marvel universe characters and themes throughout including an excellent after credits scene.Overall this has an Avengers style grandiose epic feel to it. This and Into the Spider-Verse are the two best Spider-Man movies by far. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.", "Where's the plot?": "Lame, slow, weak plot, inconsistent, convoluted, confused, talky, lacks tension. Tries to cash in on every past touchpoint but fails to pay it forward.Implausible even for the MCU and a waste of two hours.", "fan service at its best": "The best spider-man movie of all time and definitely up there with the MCU movies. Nostalgic and nicely done to where it didn't feel like cheap fan service. The cinematography and directing were a huge step up from the previous two films and i was shocked to see it was the same director. Major kudos to him for stepping up his game drastically. Obviously the villains (aside from sandman and lizard) stole the show along with tobey and andrew. We were all given the closure we needed and it was so great to see andrew garfield back, his spider-man gets a lot of hate but i truly believe he is the best spider-man. His emotion made me tear up in almost every scene he was in. Playing tobey's score during his scenes was a really nice touch as well. Tom holland improved as well with the more serious themes, i hope it's not the end of his spider-man.", "Worst Spider-Man movie ever!": "I've seen ever spider man movie and this one is the worst in my opinion. It is not edgy at all but rather just goofy silly as if made for young children. Zendaya is completely uninteresting as a love interest. There is zero chemistry between her and Tom holland. Dr strange is portrayed as a bumbling idiot. Just stupid overall.", "One of the best movies ever!!": "One of the best movies i've ever seen! Anyone who says it sucked, lacks everything right in their brains lmao, this movie has the best of every Spiderman movies combined, the plot was amazingly put and the emotions were right on point! .. definitely worth the watch!!!", "Another generic Marvel Movie": "The story makes no sense whatsoever, how can people give this dire gargabe a 10.

It's the same movie they already made 50 times.", "One of the better marvel films": "This one is one of the better marvel films. It's original, clever in construction, funny yet dramatic at times. Also, the CGI doesn't disrupt the flow of the story. All in all, a good cinematographic experience. If you enjoy the Marvel universe, this is a great addition to it.", "Not a fan of superheroes": "I am not a big superhero fan and most of the Marvel films pass me by without me noticing - but this was recommended a few times so I gave it a go.I watched it with my girlfriend: we both really enjoyed it.It is clever and witty with a good blend of action and character moments.Watching the banter between the various villains then the different spider men was really well done and made me chuckle a few times.I recognised the the first Spiderman (the one who upside-down kissed Kirsten Dunst) - I have no idea who the middle one was, but it didn't stop me enjoying this.The effects, acting and production are all great as expected.This was great fun and I would happily watch it again.", "A soft reset movie that traps audience with nostalgia": "This movie is like the JW:Fallen kingdom for Tom Holland's Spider-Man. This movie starts with peter parker at his flashy iron spider persona and ends with (spoiler alert) peter parker we all know and love(aka like tobey and andrew's). The plot is weak and electro(from TASM 2) who never knew the identity of Spider-Man in first place is.... just there for fan service and nostalgia. The serious moments get ruined by forced cringe jokes but otherwise the movie is fun and enjoyable. That being said, i am happy that its a reset movie(although with forced and weak plot but that's understandable) and now we will get to see the true Spider-Man in tom holland's next trilogy of 4-6. This homecoming trilogy falls weak to the previous two takes but i am hopeful that next trilogy will top the tobey's trilogy in the future now that he would NOT be assistant to some C-lister.CGI on this movie especially on lizard and sandman is also crap. They reused scenes from TASM and S-M 3. That's really not good and feels like a cheap powerpuff girls movie.", "''This is all my fault... I can't save everyone.''": "Spider-Man: No Way Home directed by John Watts is what I would call the perfect crowd-pleaser and it feels like a love-letter to every Spidey fan out there. We all love spider-man. He is the hero that showed us that everyone can be a hero too, that everyone can save the day. Spider-man is just a normal kid, someone that is still trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life, someone that just wants to be able to be with his friends and have a good time. Spider-man is the hero we all grew up with and the hero we all wanted to be.As a great fan of spider-man I am in an utter for words.Watching this in a theater was an amazing experience that I don't think I will sooner forget. The crowd was great and felt like everyone was connected by the love that they had for the friendly neighborhood spider-man. It was a thing of beauty, there were children, teens, adults and elders, everyone just cheering up for the faith of what is perhaps the greatest super-hero of all time.It's incredible how immersive this experience really was and how by the first five minutes of the movie I was already drowning in this universe and was replaced by the younger version of myself. I don't know what flaws there were here or if there were actually any flaws really because I felt like by the moment my 12-year-old self was summoned it never disappeared until the very last second, making me watch the whole movie through a completely different lens. A lens that didn't let me be attentive to any sort of flaws because I was just so glad I was watching a part of my childhood being displayed in front of me in the big screen, in such an heart-warming and nostalgic way.I cried, I laughed, I clapped my hands, I jumped from my seat once or twice, and I almost broke a finger and I think that says a lot about Spider-Man: No Way Home.Jon Watts seems to finally kick it in the box with No Way Home making his last two directing jobs in this trilogy look not so good. The score was very nostalgic and the music made me shiver in many different scenes. The cinematography was surprisingly great and had a distinguished look from all the other marvel movies. The action sequences were top tier.This was Tom Holland at his best, the man really gave everything he had to give to this role, and I am glad he will finally be recognized by everyone as a great Spider-Man. Willem Dafoe takes the acting award here. He was incredibly good and probably gave one of the best performances the MCU has ever witnessed.Spider-Man: No Way Home was filled with references and fan moments. It touched my heart for 2 hours and 30 minutes straight and for that I don't think I will ever be able to properly rate this movie since anything less than 5 stars feels like a betrayal to the person that I was while sitting in the theater watching this movie.At the end of the day, I'm just glad I was able to watch this with my friends and in the biggest screen possible.Thanks Spider-Man!", "Breathtaking When Its Firing on All Cylinders, Still Hugely Enjoyable When it Isn't": "So much of the MCU now can feel repetitive or it can be hard to distinguish one movie from another. I like almost all the MCU movies to some degree (Thor: The Dark World and the Eternals represent the low end and even those movies don't outright suck) but with the sheer volume, not every movie is must-see. To No Way Home's Credit, it feels like essential viewing and it's worth it to see in on the big screen. With the stakes, the action and the new precedent it sets for merging different movie universes, it's operatic and although it could be enjoyed in the privacy of your home, I'd absolutely recommend catching it at your local theatre.Truly \"special\" action in the MCU is hard to delineate. Almost all of the films in the series are at least good, a couple are merely passable and but there's a few standout action set pieces to be fair. One of the noteworthy entries is the original Doctor Strange, its pretty reliant on the CGI but its pretty thrilling and fighting between planes of existence is fun. They bring that style of fighting to No Way from Home and it works. I definitely have no complaints and it's just as effective transplanting it to here.Tom Holland's portrayal of Peter Parker is my favourite version of the character. I've said that since Homecoming and he's got the acting chops to capably pull off this character from both the physical and emotional sides. He's great again in this, some of Parker's immaturity hampers him but he's still the only actor that has truly pulled off young Peter Parker. I thought this was Zendaya's best work as MJ, she still has great chemistry with Holland and she gets more to do. I still liked Batalon's acting job as Ned even if his character was a little too goofy in some moments for the movie. Benedict Cumberbatch has Dr. Strange down at this point, he's similar to other characters that he's played but its good casting and I can't complain about that. It's always nice when Favreau shows up as Happy and it was great that Marisa Tomei finally got to show her range as Aunt May. She's been such a side character but she gets her moment in No Way Home. Seeing some of the old villains was a huge treat and despite some getting more screen time than others, no one phoned it in or didn't take it seriously. Willem Dafoe slips right back into Norman Osborne/The Green Goblin like a glove and out of all the returning characters, they did him the most justice by showing the duality of Osborne that I loved in Raimi's original. I was so excited to see Alfred Molina as Otto again, his portrayal in Spider-Man 2 is underrated, Molina showed up ready to work and they were true to his character in how he fit in the overall plot. I actually like Jamie Foxx better in this than in his original appearance, he seems more like himself and he retains his character's naivety while evolving a little. JK Simmon's return was my favourite part of Far From Home, he IS that character and I got the same sense of joy watching him build off of that character by parodying an Alex Jones style conspiracy theorist.I'll provide more of my thoughts on the overall story later but I wanted to touch on how the movie has real stakes and provides real growth for Peter Parker. It's harder to do that correctly than you would think but without spoiling anything, there's a spot in the movie where Peter is offered the choice between doing it the easy way or the hard way. He decides to try and be heroic and there are real consequences to that decision. The movie is effective at not only showing the consequences of those actions for the world at large but also with Peter. It's pretty jarring but as much as it's upsetting, that's what good movies accomplish and No Way Home invests the time to do it right.With how much No Way Home is getting showered with praise from both critics and fans alike, my review would be all positive but I did have a few comments on things that stuck out to me. While I enjoyed the sense of humour and fun that Homecoming and Far From Home, I do feel that the first half of the movie being so heavily angled towards the comedy undercut some of the stakes and emotional weight of the returning characters. I can't say much more without spoiling anything but I was so in awe when we got so see one of our favourites from the other universe that I was disappointed when it would be followed up by a slapsticky joke. But I might be in the minority there and I accept that. Some of the plot points weren't airtight as well, if you set aside the merging of the universes business and look at the story from a bird's eye view, the plot is kind of basic. If you nitpick enough, there are some holes. But I think that won't be a problem for everyone as well and I don't mean to just whine and ruin the experience for other people.Spider-Man: No Way Home is thrilling, heartbreaking and genre-bending. It deserves the ample amount of celebration its already gotten and I don't want the fact that I didn't think think it was perfect to cheapen my praise. Even if it isn't flawless (to me) it's a unique and memorable entry in MCU, there's superior character work, great acting, memorable action set pieces and A LOT of fun to be had. My audience cheered and applauded throughout the screening and instead of getting annoyed, it made me smile. It was nice that when some of the older characters made appearances that it meant as much to other people as it did to me growing up. No Way Home is still fantastic and if you're feeling fatigue from so many superhero movies, this is still one of the ones it's worth making time for and giving a chance.", "Love Letter": "Is a love letter to all Spider Man fans.

I dare say he was better here than the original movie.WARNING!!!!!Spoiler below:It was really cool that Daredevil made a cameo but that was just about it. A cameo. Why? Missed opportunity. If it was me i would have put at least one scene were Daredevil shows up in his suit and helps Spider-Man.Also i loved the Raimi movie memes like:\nNorman saying he is something of a scientist himself.Or the one where $&##;@ stretches and talks about his back.Also the way spiderman showed up when ned opened the portal and they were saying peter peter. That was a nice surprise.Also I really hope they make another Tom Holland movie with venom finding a new Eddie Brock or the same but from Hollands universe? Since a part of Venom stayed in Hollands universe.ALSO this is the perfect opportunity for to make up and give us the sequel we never got.Since Raimi is now working with Marvel again after Doctor Strange they can let him make his Spider-Man 4 since Tobey Maguire is also back. Just Do It. The movie will start with Tobey going back stabbed and telling MJ what crazy thing he just experienced.Can't wait.", "Ambitious, Entertaining 2nd Tier MCU": "I wasn't a huge fan of Avengers: Endgame - I found it too long, a little dull, and a bit of a cheat in the way it pressed the reset button to get out of a narrative dead-end. Not that it was bad, just it didn't blow me away the way it seemed to do for so many. And I expected to see feel similarly about this - a film that ended up almost saving post-pandemic cinema and seemed to be lauded by just about everybody.It would be easy to see the multiverse as another MCU reset button, a desperate attempt to bolster flagging interest in the mega-franchise. Even if that is what lay behind the multiverse narrative here - and it may well not have been - this is the first time in a while that an MCU film has seemed to reignite some fun and inventiveness; it embraces creative ideas, is not afraid to be a little silly ... but it's also not immune to some Endgame like pomposity and over-inflated sense of its own ideas. That being said the film provides a genuine moral dilemma which, though not entirely explored as much as it could be, does give real food for thought.Two and a half hours is, of course, too long for this sort of film, but we're well past the point where anything superhero related has a sense of economy and efficiency.All told, I imagine the runaway success of this film is in part explained by an audience deprived of communal large-scale experiences thankful for something inventive, fun, and exciting; that's not meant to be faint praise ... it's just that a little further on from release it's more second-tier MCU than it is top tier. I do fear that the MCU is becoming so sprawling that it's starting to alienate the less committed fans ... but there's no denying that on its own terms this is genuinely ambitious and entertaining; something which the MCU tends to be at in its better incarnations.", "A motion picture EVENT.": "Even as a casual viewer, this was incomparably immense; to continue on from 2019's historic \"Avengers: Endgame\" (which is arguably when all other solo-franchises within Disney's fictional world seemed to lose their sense of direction) with a continued purposefulness, naturally establish the epic multi-verse saga (sadly, the only movie to be great within it, thus far), resurrect previous incarnations of the titular character (played by different actors whose profound inclusion somehow doesn't over-shadow the entire project), thematically pay-off their individual story arcs (one of which was unfinished) to advance lead Tom Holland's own emotional journey & then use the two legendary predecessors (Andrew Garfield & Tobey Maguire) to essentially explore what it means to be \"Spiderman\" (organically facilitating his layered development) in order to finally force the current version to confront his personal identity (the very thing Peter's been grappling with) so he reaffirms who he actually is, what he stands for & what his symbol represents etc. To audiences, learning the true iconic lesson (\"with great power comes great responsibility\") so the narrative's able to ingeniously re-contextualise the MCU trilogy as a coming-of-age tale acting as a super-hero origin story (a naive boy, gradually maturing in to a man), whilst simultaneously succeeding in saving not only his soul from perishing & corruption, but the ensemble of antagonists too (whose fates are intertwined with their counterparts), righting unresolved wrongs & rectifying biggest regrets (Raimi's having the chance to prevent the glider from perforating Norman, Webb's preserving the life of MJ in the way he couldn't with Gwen & Watts' rescinding his quest for vengeance) rewardingly granting them closure & providing a second chance for all, borne from the protagonist's main attribute (wrongly perceived as a weakness by 'Green Goblin') of morality (stressing the importance of his defining trait - proving why he's deserving of redemption & emphasising what makes him so special as a genuine \"hero\" - selflessly making sacrifices in service of the betterment of others), setting the web-slinger up to be the real personification of the inspirational figure we all recognise from the comics in future installments (the present form having learned from their mistakes in order to transform in to a superior - purer - manifestation?) - all in the space of 1 single film!?Take a bow. Striking a meaningful balance with all those plates spinning precariously in the air (without dropping a single one) is remarkable to witness.From a storytelling perspective, 2021's box office hit is easily amongst some of the best the mouse house has ever had to offer cinema-goers (garnering major financial success for a reason - not just a gimmick) - imbuing depth & actual personality (for once, as opposed to corporate soullessness), resonating powerfully in a heartfelt pay-off that satisfyingly feels earned, after years in the making. I'm just frustrated to say that the visual filmmaking (despite being shot by the indomitable cinematographer of James Cameron's 2009 masterpiece \"Avatar\", Mauro Fiore & directed by Jon Watts) is over-reliant on unconvincing VFX & lacks (in style) the brilliance of its endless substance... Which is admittedly one of the only times I've (if) ever been able to say that. Basically, the blandness of the aesthetic paints the impression of a standard Marvel movie - when it's a shame, since \"No Way Home\" is anything but.Creatively, the talent at the helm accomplish wonders; honouring the past & revivifying their combined legacies (without veering in to cringe-worthy sentimentality or over-indulgence) & utilising the culmination of seemingly disconnected plot threads (tied neatly together) as a catalyst to carve out a new, promising future.

All the scenes with toby and andrew were so rushed it hardly felt like they were even in the movie. The \"villains\" were back and forth between good and evil so much it was a mess. I loved the movie for what it was, but overall it fell short for me. For a movie that relied so heavy on fan service, they forgot to give us actual substance.

But MCU has managed to succeeded to conclude their Spider-Man trilogy. Spider-Man: No Way Home is close to be another one of my favorite MCU films. We've seen Peter Parker enter the MCU films even though he was owned by Sony. And yet, the movie has given the level of charm that sets the universe, including with the additions of the villains we know in the Spider-Man universe. And that makes the story a lot bigger than the previous two, along with the characters that both prove how we care for them and great additions that really work for the film. And of course, the visuals are incredibly crafted with both the costumes and the creativity from Strange Magic's powers. This is an absolute must watch for MCU films that have waited for this film. If you were excited and actually watched it in the theaters, good for you. Me, I didn't. But I just rented and watched it on streaming. Yeah, I miss going to the movies as well. I'm not gonna lie, this has came out a lot more what I expect. In fact, I find this to be the best of the three. Spider-Man has offered a lot of content that turn out great, and this was no exception.", "Truly Awesome": "Well made film for all THE spiderman that has come till date.

Also, the movie contains a lot of emotions and make you laugh and cry so many times. What a great end to the trilogy.", "Spider verse still did it better": "Before you spider fans start bashing me just know Spider-Man is my favorite superhero of all time... I'm Not hating on the movie it's a solid enjoyable and very entertaining ride... I give it a solid 8 but it's not no 9.2 this is an insane score for this movie rn and I think it's just the hype at the moment. If anything it's a average movie at face value HOWEVER me being a fan of the entire spider man saga as we know it I'd give this a 8/10 a lot of problems but I do agree the spectacle overall outweighs the negatives. Definitely an amazing achievement in cinema. Worth the watch and fine, it is worth the hype just a little bit. But I'm trying to be a little more strict on my films I watch.", "Non Beatable Movie In the World": "I have Never Seen Such a Beautiful Movie Like this Marvel You Are the Best.SpiderMan Was my favourite Movies from childhood and you have remembered me my fabulous childhood and make my mood thanks for all movies that you have created for us.", "It lived up to the hype": "I did not expect this to live up to the hype.A film like this with everything ever from every Spiderman not just the MCU one would never have worked outside the MCU. It's like a greatest hits tour.All three Spidermen were good, this was so ambitious and was pulled off well.", "Nostalgia factor hides a below-average plot": "Nearly 20 years after Sam Raimi's original blockbuster hit theaters, it was amazing to see the second reboot of the webslinger's story reach the heights that it did in 2021's 'Spider-man: No Way Home.' With the added benefit of being fully welcomed into the MCU, Tom Holland's Peter Parker has asserted dominance on the Mount Rushmore of spideys, but this installment proved that three spider-men are better than one.Yes, this film is pretty messy and cheesy, and Jon Watts and the writers tried to fit too many characters into the story, but there's something about seeing Holland, Andrew Garfield and the OG Tobey Maguire all don the suit and assemble to take on their infamous archnemeses. Of these, Jamie Foxx's Electro steals the show, which is fitting considering he originally appeared in the weakest entry to date.Despite the overall silly tone, 'No Way Home' is filled with mixed emotions, ups and downs, and bittersweetness. Parker's relationships with his friends and loved ones are tested and taken to the brink, so it will be interesting to see how future films handle some of the difficult consequences of this one.Putting aside the plot and bloatedness of the cast, with the introduction of the multiverse, 'Spider-man: No Way Home' has pioneered a concept that will enable Hollywood to find ways to bring together many beloved permutations of superhero castings - great for fans and business security alike.", "Extraordinary, Must watch": "This is the best Marvel movie I have ever seen with lots of inspiring scenes and amazing action. You should watch it in the biggest screen possible. Don't miss this movie.", "Expectations Exceeded!": "What a phenomenal movie totally worth the 2 hours of my time and it seems that they hinted at a possible live action Miles Morales, when Andrew Garfield revealed his face in front of Electro, Electro said \"I thought you were gonna be black\" in which in which Garfield replied with an apology and said no in which Electro responds with \"Don't sweat it there's probably a black Spider-Man somewhere out there.\" After that line I am hyped for a live action Miles Morales movie.", "Didn't scream like this ever before.": "Everything was great. The plot was very interesting and the cameos were lit. Its hard to review this title without giving away spoilers so I just want to say just go and watch the movie because it's definitely worth it. You will get a bit of everything.", "A bombastic, entertaining fan-centered experience that needs a stronger plot": "One could argue that there has been no movie more anticipated in the last couple of years than SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME. Spider-Man fans and moviegoers alike were dripping with anticipation to see how Tom Holland's version of the character would handle the Multiverse, and now that the moment is finally here, fans are exploding with excitement. After all, if there is one thing that NO WAY HOME excels at, it is giving the die-hard fans an experience that will leave them in a state of euphoria for weeks. This film is one that is unabashedly created for fans, which is admirable given how well it gives Spider-Man followers what they want and more. However, when it comes to being an actual movie with a solid plot and humor that sticks the landing, the film often comes up well short.Describing the plot of this film is like walking through a field of landmines, so everything I describe will have to be maddeningly vague so as not to spoil the surprises. The film continues from exactly where the end-credits scene of Spider-Man: Far From Home left off, with Holland's Peter Parker being accused by Mysterio of murder and with his identity as Spider-Man revealed. These revelations alter his life and the lives of those around him, causing him to turn to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for some help. However, Strange reveals more horrible problems that may not only impact Peter, but the fate of the entire universe.NO WAY HOME starts off as a somewhat typical superhero movie with a decent yet forgettable plot and humor that often falls flat on its face, making the first act the weakest stretch of the movie. Much of the movie's plot revolves around the main three characters (Peter, MJ and Ned) attempting to get into MIT, which comes across as a cheap device to get the actual interesting superhero stuff started. Parker makes some very poor decisions near the first half and ends up accidentally causing all of the catastrophe that ensues. The movie reminds the audience that Peter is just a kid and his decision-making skills are naturally not the best at his age, but the plot relies on these poor decisions to such an extreme extent that the film falls apart if one thinks about it for more than five minutes. The first half contains the same fundamental issues that dragged Far From Home down, including a sense of humor that falls flat just as often as it makes the audience chuckle.However, the film also contains a lot of the strengths that power the previous two films -- mainly Tom Holland himself as Spider-Man. Holland embodies this role like no other has before, and delivers an emotionally charged performance that surpasses any expectations of a superhero movie such as this. The other performance that stands out here is Willem Dafoe, who steps back into a role that he hasn't played in almost two decades as if he never left. (That is not a spoiler, it was in the trailer.) The villains in general are surprisingly well-fleshed out and supply some of the strongest scenes in a somewhat underwhelming first half. The last performance that should be highlighted here is an actor who brings more emotion than every other, and who proves to fans that more material should be created starring his rich and interesting version of an iconic character. (Have fun deciphering the possible subject of that last sentence.)Luckily, NO WAY HOME picks up in a major way during the last hour of the film, with plot elements that prove to be far more interesting and emotionally compelling than anything presented previously. Even the humor seems to land more in the last act, and the chemistry between certain characters is electric, making me wish the entire film had this degree of quality. As some expected, the last act of the film has a substantial amount of fan service -- moments that pander to fans' expectations and which will have little significance to the uninitiated. Sometimes fan service can fail miserably, but in this case it works so well that the movie becomes far superior as a result. The writers also blend the fan moments with important plot points and very powerful scenes, making the last act as satisfying as it could possibly be. The saving grace for NO WAY HOME is the knowledge that despite the lackluster first half, the writers knew exactly where the destination of the plot was located, creating an satisfying experience overall.SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME is an experience worth having, especially in the theater with a large crowd of fans on every side. As a fan-centered project, this film is an unqualified success of epic proportions, and is already on track to become one of the most successful movies in history. Nothing I can say in this review can minimize an achievement like that. However, for a movie that is endlessly praised and hyped up, NO WAY HOME fails to deliver an unique and new experience other than the fan service. At the end of the day, the film is another MCU movie, and no amount of moments that are created for crowd reaction will remedy a decent and forgettable script. This movie will be justifiably remembered for being an ode to Spider-Man, what the character means to people, and the fans that make the character the phenomenon it is today. If only it proved to be a better stand-alone story without relying on the Marvel Cinematic Universe to curate the mediocre plot.B.", "Didn't know my childhood had waited 20 years for this!": "Watching No Way Home felt like my childhood and my adulthood were embracing each other in a warm, friendly hug. The nostalgia was brilliantly balanced with advancing Tom Holland's Spider-man and developing his character. Andrew Garfield's Spider-man also received some long-awaited closure after an abrupt end to his story. The effects, action, and humor all reinforced a heartfelt film focusing on the characters' processing of loss and grief.Overall : One of Marvel's absolute best!", "Amazing!!!": "Best movie I have ever watched in theaters. Hands down best Marvel movie to have been released! Spiderman no way home is a 10/10 movie. No doubt you'll love it.", "A film to wrap it all": "At this point, there is no doubt that this is a good film. With this film being a culmination of all three series, it was interesting to see how everything came together. There were also many well timed comedic scenes.However, one has to ask, is this film good because of itself or because of the ones that came before? As someone who watched most, but not all the spiderman films from all three series, some details simply went over my head, details that add significant value to the film itself. While the film is in itself an interesting film to watch, it is NOT for one trying to dip their feet into the MCU. One would likely be too confused to enjoy much of the film. However, with background knowledge, it becomes a joy to watch.Watching this was a funny, emotional and nostalgic journey that is sure to satisfy Marvel fans, and probably most other people. Watch it!", "So meta it falls flat": "This is, according to some dude on the Blu-ray cover: \"The bestest Marvel movie of all time\". No, it isnt. That's The Punisher with Dolph Lundgren. But I digress. It's sad to see how LITTLE it takes to give a movie 10/10. It's not even the best Spidey movie. But it at least borrow at least 2 characters from the best Spidey, Doc Oc included. The\" story\" is obviously for kids by now, mixing this \"multiverse\" completely in, reintroducing I don't know... 5-6 villains from the past parade of movies. Including the 2 former Spidey actors. While that may give orgasm to some, I found it irritating as hell to hear all the meta meta jokes and winks. It's a sad state to see this \"fantastic\" movie play in 2 billion worldwide. YES, I have Marvel fatigue. At least it's better than the terrible The Eternals... and Black Widow.", "The Orgasm Of The Spiderman Movies Franchise": "When you collide three universes into one, things could get super messy. But in this movie, things went splendidly. It's the closure to the three Peter Parker stories. Tobey Maguire's got to save Norman Osborn, something he couldn't do in his franchise. Andrew Garfield got to save MJ, something he couldn't do in his franchise (he couldn't save Gwen). And Tom Holland got to be a real superhero. A real Spiderman. To put it short, this movie is the orgasm of the three Spiderman franchise. Am I satisfied? More like, I'm spent after the triple orgasms.", "Worth the watch": "Good movie. Not my favorite Spider-Man but still worth the watch.Probably my Favorite thing about this movie is the amount of interesting opportunities it opened for the Spider-Man movies or tv shows that will come.My least favorite thing is that the plot doesn't leave a mark. This storyline could just as well have never happened and not much would have changed.", "Best Spider-Man movie ever.": "I watched it in Dolby atoms and it was incredible. The film was a good amount of time and I didn't get bored once. The jokes were very funny and made sense. The soundtrack was amazing. I went wild when Tobey Maguire And Andrew Garfield came through the portals. Venom should face up against Spider-Man in Tom Holland Spider-Man 4.", "Second Chances.": "Marvel has given me an idea of giving my self a second chance to my life, Il never suicide just to be alive to watch these films. I was just 8 years old when the Tobey was spider man and now he is back feels like I'm a child again.", "Time to go home": "All a bit daft but harmless funBest part of film was bringing the other two Spider-Men back, which was a clever idea and could only work the one time.Always think the acting talents of Zendaya are wasted in this sort of movie which relays so heavily on special effects, though always good to see Marisa Tomei on a big screen\nIf you like seeing all the enemies of Spider- Man come together in one film, then you will not be disappointed, but though Tom Holland has been a decent Peter Parker I am not sure where this franchise can go now with regards to making classy sequels and I for one will not be in a hurry to see it.", "Spectacular Spider-Man": "Everything that every Spider-Man fan was hoping for, No Way Home creates a collision of continued MCU storytelling with pure nostalgic joy.Two and a half hours fly by as viewers are repeatedly hit with exciting reveals, in a film virtually impossible to properly review without spoilers. Simply put; a great (and mostly importantly, coherent) plot which has depth without becoming convoluted, the return of some of the fan-favourite villains, each updated without losing their charm, and an enforced investment from viewers.CGI and action scenes are brilliant, giving the likes of Doc Ock and Green Goblin the opportunity to revel in greater special effects. Plus the acting is just as good as it was nearly 20 years ago - Dafoe is superb yet again and even given the capacity to improve upon his previous goblin. Electro is hugely improved upon, stripping away the goofy style of The Amazing Spider-Man, and Sandman is kept consistent. Lizard still looks pretty stupid, but who cares. Honestly, the villains don't each get that much individual screen time, but there's so much else going on that it doesn't become a hindrance.It not a perfect film, but for someone who was a child when the original Spider-Man trilogy came out and has followed this character on screen since, it brings everything together, and is just joyful.", "The most fun I've had in a cinema for a long time": "This movie has some of the usual MCU flaws but they still tied it together really good. There are also loads of references to the old movies making it a really fun experience for long time fans (myself included). The characters that were brought back from the classics were well written and stayed mostly true to their original personalities. After making some (in my opinion) pretty bad movies and shows I feel like this was a big comeback for the MCU. It might not have been the best movie ever on a technical level but it sure was a whole lot of fun. Fans of the old movies and just Spidey fans in general really need to give this a watch right away.", "Simply bad writing...": "Ok, I'm a Marvel fan. I really am but the movie just wasn't that good. I mean having 3 spidermans and 5 villains from different universes is just incredibly Amazing, but hang on a minute getting all of these characters in one movie for just the fact that peter parker (Tom holland) could cure 5 VILLAINS FROM DIFFERENT UNIVERSES is just so bad.I mean look what can you get from a 3 spidermans and 5 villains in one movie from different universes....\nCome on CURING VILLAINS is that what you can get from All of THAT. It's just like when you want to go from a country to another country and you have a Helicopter but you ride a bicycle. I mean you have a helicopter why would you take a bicycle!!!Unless there's some hidden script, I don't know about that would explain all of that sadly the movie was just made for nothing...\nAnd there's more...Ok, solving the problem of the people knowing Peter Parker's identity (Tom Holland) by a spell that would let all the world forget peter parker was awesome, but is Peter Parker's interruption to Doctor Strange really an excuse for opening a multiverse??? And again it could just be better....\nAnd the worst thing was after all of that, The World forgot Peter Parker. I mean after all of this 2 hour and 30 minutes movie they would let all of the people forget him, WHY???? You did it from the beginning 15 minutes of the movie and it didn't work and then you do it AGAIN.I'm a HUGE FAN OF MARVEL, but I just expected more from this Incredible idea.......", "MCU IS ON ANOTHER LEVEL.": "The Movie which brings us all together. Story,Screenplay,Vfx,Background score and the Emotions, Everything was perfectly crafted and executed. Tom Holland in a different dimensional play. Lots of Surprises that you didnt even expected.

I would like to support her.", "With great direction comes world class film": "Just watched Spiderman no way home. One word, it was amazing. This has to be for me on of the best Spiderman films and for sure tom holland best Spiderman movie. This film was a tribute to the other two Spiderman movies and really a great tribute to all us Spiderman and comic fans.The story was very good, we got to see the emotional rollercoaster side of this film, with joy and sadness. Lots of action scenes in this film with a balance of comedy.Yes the rumours are true guys, everyone, we got to see alll three Spiderman's in this film, Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and my man Tobey Maguire aka all of their versions of Spiderman !!!!That part was so insane and incredible, everyone in the cinema was clipping and shouting with joy when we saw Andrew and Tobey in this film as Peter Parker.Once again Peter Parker makes mistakes and has to clean up and make things right but do what is right. We get to see the Multiverse which leads to doctor strange 2.We got to see Doctor Strange and Matt Murdock in this film guys.Now the best part, we got to see. Alfred Molina as Dr Otto Octavius, Jamie Fox as Max Dillion, Thomas Haden Church as Sandman, Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curt Connors, but man this nearly made me cry to see Willem Dafoe as my main Green Goblin.Once again, Willem Dafoe acting was amazing, incredible, just how he can take this role again and switch from being Norman Osborn pretending to be helpless Norman and then just a few seconds switching to the Green Goblin.This is the best, amazing, Spiderman film, full of surprises, but just to see all three version of Spiderman together on screen was outstanding. It was good to see Andrew Garfield as he was my second favourite Spiderman who was more of a funny Spiderman that makes jokes he should have had one more film. I grew up watching my main Spiderman the one and only Toby Maguire who to me is the best Spiderman aka Peter Parker.This really, is truly a a great Spiderman films for all Spiderman fans of all three generations. Just amazing.Also what I love is the detail of each of the spider mans. We get to see how Andrew Garfield Spiderman is doing with the death of his girlfriend and how it has made an impact on him and we get to see how mature Tobey Maguire Spiderman has become over the years and was the one to help, get to Tom holland Spiderman. You can see the differences of all three spidermans.", "One of the Worst MCU movies EVER": "A shallow movie with repelling CGI. Unable to transfer emotion. Bombarded with too many actors. Intentional leaks in order to fool the people just because we'll see 3 spidermen together. I'm sorry to see everyone has fallen to their trap. This is by no means a good movie.", "The Tom Holland Spiderman movies are the worst": "The lasting impression from the movie...how much I miss Andrew and Tobey. Andrew stole every scene he was in. He really should be Spiderman. The neurotic acting by the 20 somethings Tom, Zendaya, and the diversity sidekick was so annoying and tiresome. Zendaya can not act! She is only in the movie because of Disney and being Tom Holland's girlfriend. The plot of the movie...Saving villains by giving them a second chance. This is Woke Spiderman. Lots of fan service, a plot with lots of holes, and wokeness. Disney movies just make me cringe anymore. Spiderman 2 is still the best.", "This movie shouldn't be above 7.5": "There is a lot of things wrong with this movie. First when everyone knows about Peter Parker being spider man. People should be constantly bothering Peter and his friends. MJ is working when Peter and his other friend go there to talk about college acceptance. No one is there, why? Everyone knows that's Spider-Man. Peter, his friends and aunt may should be all celebrities that can't be out in public. Then we have the time when Peter go to meet dr. Strange. He tells him to erase everyone's memory. But he kept telling strange he wants this person to remember and then that person. Why was Dr. Strange even doing that? Why didn't he just stop the spell and tell him exactly who he wanted to remember. This made Dr. Strange look like a fool who just got his powers. Dumb!!! The main problem of this movie is when they finally get all the bad guys and Dr. Strange gets ready to undo the spell and have the bad guys sent to their world. Peter Parker/spiderman doesn't agree because he doesn't want them to die. What the hell!!!!! What is a he a saint that needs to save everyone? Even the bad guys? This pathetic spiderman causes this mess through Mindless Dr. Strange and then Peter has the audacity to tell strange that he doesn't agree and fights strange. This causes even a bigger mess. Spider-Man is not like a 13 year old that they made him out to look. He's like 17/18. He shouldn't be this dumb and immature. There were good moments in the movie which was really well done. I liked the movie but I can't just ignore all the negative parts of the movie. Most importantly this movie shows 8.3 rating and that's really high considering those big flaws they had. 7.3 should be the right rating.", "This one really surprised me": "It doesn't feel like your generic MCU movie.There is no political message, no ultra-strong female characters just for the sake of it.

After breaking the Multi-verse the young Spider-man needs some unique help in fixing his mistake, enter Spider-man (Tobey McGuire) and Spider-man (Andrew Garfield.)

An excellent ending to the Spider-man trilogies!", "Was expecting a lot more": "With great hype surrounding the film I expected the MCU to have branched away from its typical algorithm. Unfortunately I felt it was a lot of the same with predictable plot developments and fight scenes.

I never thought in a million years that they would one day join together in a such visual treat.Even their villains kept in great shape over the years, they still looked same as those days.Wow just Wow!

To say I was captivated and mesmerized would be a huge understatement.The second half most especially was so spine tingling, full of intensity, speckled with tinges of sweet comedy and emotion.Also I unexpectedly cried like some crazy person halfway through in one very sad scene and then again at the end, I was absolutely sobbing (and was subsequently embarrassed about my sniffling which I was trying to suppress in this new Covid world!).I was completely overwhelmed, in a good way.

Thereafter, in another cringe worthy turn, Spidey decides he's allowed to make things worse.At this point, Disney seems to clearly be moving away from character development and plot driven scripts to setting up next sequel in their mega franchise MCU (next Dr Strange, in this case).Please stop getting greedy Disney, there's so much good source material to tell good stories. 2 duds like this and The Eternals back to back, suddenly DC is looking better.

It is very Nostalgic. How the script has been well written. They make every fans dream true. Comedy, Emotions, Fight Squence, Conversations everything was best. All the Cast have gave wonderful performance. I was waiting for this movie for 2.5 years. It is best spider man movie ever, how they make spider man famous then in climax do the best thing with spider man, That is Spider Man does. No complaints but I just have a doubt, where as Doctor Strange took so many time to learn magic, Ned just did easily. Overall Movie is Best. Every minute it gives nostalgia. Spider man is love from childhood. Thanks Marvel+Sony and John Watts, how precisely he directed this masterpiece. The great future coming to MCU.", "Every wildest fantasy made possible": "If you liked:\nAvengers: Endgame\nAny Spider-Man movie\nLogan! This review features spoilers only related to the things seen in the trailer. If you've watched it, you're good. !Judging by the fact that this movie passed the $1 billion mark in worldwide box office in less than a weekend; it does not need an introduction or any setup. If you're a Marvel fan you have probably already watched it; and if not, you most likely know what the main premise of the film is and why it was exciting as hell when rumors started getting out and the first teaser dropped. The Multiverse, a concept we saw introduced in \"WandaVision\" and \"Loki\" (but don't be scared if you haven't watched much of other Marvel stuff, you don't need it to understand the plot). Peter teams up with Dr. Strange; they have a little too much fun and break the borders between our reality and multiple other realities. Literally anything can happen on the screen from now on, and, as we see in the trailer, Marvel bring old villains from the original Spider-Man movies back to life: Dr. Octavio Octopus, Green Goblin, Electro... That by itself, if you think about it long and hard, is sort of a miracle and is one the most amazing and revolutionary things that could have happened to such a big cinematic universe. This is because a completely different company with different interests and incentives owns the rights to those old characters - Sony (which is why Venom is also not connected to any of the current Marvel films). It is probably unimaginable how much money had to be moved and how much time those two giants had to spend negotiating in order for something like that to happen, taking into account the fact that the whole Tom Holland Spider-Man deal was almost canceled some years ago. Also, they could have just bought the rights for those characters; but Marvel went an extra mile and managed to also recast all of the original actors! And they don't just bring them back in a short cameo; they breathe life back into their stories, they give those characters closure and redemption, and it just makes you nostalgic for things you never knew you needed to be nostalgic for. They even used the original soundtracks for individual villains (like Hans Zimmer's epic Electro Suite); which made me, as a soundtrack geek, appreciate this immense effort even further.The third film is a lot more dramatic and heartfelt than the first two; think Endgame compared to Infinity War; and Holland is finally getting a lot of chances to show off his acting skills in a CGI-filled universe that doesn't usually require that much acting. Overall, they did an amazing tribute to ALL 7 of the previous Spider-Man films, paying attention to the smallest details and making every wildest idea possible; and if you're a fan of at least one of them, you will be rewarded beyond your expectations.Go give Marvel your money. In theaters.", "The Film We'd All Been Waiting For": "Elaborate, nostalgic and extremely well-polished. With familiar faces of the MCU making somewhat a surprise appearance, contributing to the chart-topping Box Office success. Rave reviews of a well-humoured, thrilling script that justifies its praise and proves to be one of the greatest action spectacles of all time.With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, our friendly neighbourhood web-slinger is unmasked and no longer able to separate his normal life as Peter Parker from the high stakes of being a superhero. When Peter asks for help from Doctor Strange, the stakes become even more dangerous, forcing him to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man.Tom Holland has came a long way from his Billy Elliott days and an awkwardly forced Geordie accent. The 25-year-old from Kingston upon Thames has pioneered his persona and made the role his own over the recent years. To visualise the three versions of Spider 'men' in the film only reminds us of Holland's class, the witty and at-times clumsy character takes away the seriousness of the superhero picture. The cinematography of the film is state of the art, from a snowy Doctor Strange's HQ to dusking green-land in a turmoil chain of events. Like most Marvel productions, the stunt team are under-appreciated for their roles in production - Tom Holland impressively performs his own, and trained tirelessly in preparation, however, the movie credits 75 names in its stunt section, emphasising the importance of their involvement in crafting such a high-profile, high-quality instalment.The watch itself is tantalising, a gripping plot which turns in mysterious ways and continues to give; a multiverse, modern day college decisions and the not-so-usual auntie and love interest relationship bode to create a masterpiece.Rising to its expectations. A scintillating display.", "Fun and awkward": "They tried to do something great and it wasn't! The\ntwo older spidermen were very good but the villains unfortunate were not, most of the time ( Green Goblin was good, Dafoe helped a lot) as their motives kept changing. Their decisions kept changing, never got what they were thinking! Did anyone get if Lizard was bad when in the cage or if he had a goal in this universe he was found in, was he waiting for a cure in the van? Did he want one? Didn't Electro change his mind about the cure very easily? It is a big decision! And he didn't seem like the Electro we knew, neither as Electro neither when he was cured, completely different guy! And it wasn't the electricity that made him evil but the new found power, how did he change so quickly after the cure! I can understand Doctor Octopus changing to his old self! Also, Doctor Octopus was was kind of mild for a period before the cure, which was strange, not like the madman we knew! Why did Sandman get angry at the end and attack Spiderman, he is supposed to trust him, he believed him the whole movie! What made him feel sooo betrayed? The jokes ( if that) were childish at best and too many! It was fun but not a lot, time passed! I an 38, if I was 20, I guess I woukd like it better but most adventures are made for teenagers these days and seem to be made hastily and without inspiration but because they were ordered! So many good actors, I wish they shined more!", "It's good and nostalgic": "Though the plot is deeply flawed and driven by insanely stupid decisions, the entertainment value makes up for it and the nostalgia hits the spot...\n.", "Back to Marvel Excellence": "I have to be honest here, after too progressive and boring \"eternals\", underwhelming \"black widow\", awful \"captain marvel\" and a few dissapointing series (no I did not like Marvel tv shows), I did not expect much from this movie, but they trully delivered their Marvel excellence. One thing can be said for sure, Tom Holland is a rightful heir to Robert Downey Jr. In this universe. He is the main draw and I hope they will give him few more movies of his own.So many refernces to previous spidey movies and cartoons, it's amazing. Andrew Garfield deserve one more movie of his own. They could explore what happened after.I took a star off the perfect rating because the story lacks logic, and spiderman trully acts stupid after what he has been through.New Dr. Strange can't come soon enough.Advised for all!", "WOW! What an epic film! This film has a darker tone than the first two MCU Spider-Man films that I saw. 10/10 stars \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d": "I just came back from watching the film. We all knew that the multiverse was coming and it finally happened. When I saw Alfred Molina's character of Doctor Octopus in the teaser, my mouth dropped and I had goosebumps. I liked Molina's line, \"Hello, Peter\". It's great to see Alfred Molina again. It was also awesome to see Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin and Jamie Foxx as Electro. Benedict Cumberbatch is still great playing Doctor Strange.I definitely loved all the action scenes and special effects throughout the entire film. I couldn't take my eyes off this film. There were dark moments in this film and that's what I like about it. It's all the thrills and chills of the entire story and plot. Tom Holland and Zendaya really have great chemistry in the MCU. Jacob is still hilarious as Ned. There are Marvel references that I noticed in the film but I won't spoil them. It's great that Marvel Studios has this big project working with Sony and Columbia Pictures. The whole Marvel project gave the audience something big like the previous ones that we've seen throughout the years. I want to watch this film again and again to give me the excitement. This film has a high entertaining value for me.", "Best Marvel Movie Ever, a Real Perfection": "NO SPOILER here, calm down.The drama, the humor, the action, the CGI, the scoring, the acting, the writing (how it connect 'them' all and gave each characters fair share of appearance) are perfection. I cried several time, thank God we all wore mask lol. God these casts acting were looked so sincere. I'm so glad of being born as millennial (1991 baby here), therefore I'm lucky enough to watched all Spidey movies on theatre. Something gen Z-ers cant relate lol.If you had the money (and someone to babysit your toddlers if you have some), please watch this one on movie theatre. Don't wait till it's available on streaming apps, cable, tv's or worse, download it illegally. Don't say You have no time for it either. Soooo many things are unfair but we all get 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Go watch it, NO WAY HOME is a gem.", "Unwatchable": "This movie wad a pain to watch, it was slow and without any logic.It contains a lot of forced scenes which don't add to the story, the jokes are... There were jokes in this movie?Luckily Stan Lee did not need to watch this rubbish this movie shows.I'm never ever gonna watch another Marvel movie again.", "The 3 Amigos ....": "So far the best Holland\u00b4s Spider-Man movie because of the much anticipated 3 Amigos reunion plus the 5 villains from the previous movies.Great CGId action, and plenty of drama with a main character dying.This is in times a much obscured movie since the last Avengers movie.3 more of Holland\u00b4s on the way.", "End of an Era!": "All these years came to this. I can't believe that this movie even exists! I loved Tobey and I watched his movies like a thousand times. Then when Andrew came I also loved him. After that when Holland played Spider man I loved him. I had never predicted that one day they would gather in one single movie. This movie is a celebration for all these years. Special thanks to the one who no one is talking about Mr Stan Lee! I am sure he is proud now.", "Absolutely Insane": "Such a good movie, the way they incorporated all the villains and Spider-Man's was very well done. Feels like an Avengers movies in regards to the amount of ppl in it yet it never felt crammed. Will and have watched again.", "This is a little better than Avengers: Endgame.": "THIS IS SUCH AN INSANE MOVIE! Tobey and Andrew are back and the Sinister Six have come back for an epic showdown! This is in my top 5 of my favorite movies of all-time!Fantastic movie (100/100)", "See through the hype": "Just watched the new Spiderman movie, and was I happy it ended. Don't get me wrong, there are quite a lot of good scenes, ideas and action sequences... but it's all too long, over emotional and the story is all a bit balancing on a hype idea. (Trying not to spoil it here).I did feel a few things coming, and it was getting predictable. I also don't really understand this superhero metaverse.... One movie they all work together, and then the next movie its just on their own... although there are plenty of bad guys to catch.The VFX are amazing, I saw it even in 3D and was worth it! All the performances are great, and even a bit camp. I did enjoy the movie, but when there was another dramatic dialogue, and another, and another... I was waiting for another good action sequence. Good Spidey-movie... but to my opinion not the best.", "AMAZING": "This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman. I loved every second of it!", "The strongest since EndGame": "Wow, believe me the hype and the waiting was totally worth it!Im gonna keep this short and with no spoilers, but i have the ability to write over 100 lines about how the movie was perfect and still wont be able to give it the right amount of praise it deserves.One of the most important things that I noticed that this movie doesn't totally rely on vfx(not like shang shi).And not like any other super hero movie, here in No Way Home, the story, the characters, the drama and the scenario is what's going to keep you on the hook.", "Very bold and exciting film!": "The creative envelope was pushed here, damn amazing storyline and great action sequences. Definitely worth another watch.The acting was top drawer all round but Cumberbacht steals the show. The Marvel multiverse was really opened and we should be seeing lots more superheroes and supervillain soon.", "Master piece": "It is indeed a master piece. A beautiful of all spider man movies there were, a splendid work of art and entertainment and Jon Watts have beautifully portrayed this piece. Seems he was truly meant for this character. The way he brought in all the characters, from the present, the past the other universe, magnificent.It will bring you entertainment, it will bring you joy, it will keep you glued to your seats, you simply cant guess the upcoming scene, let along the ending and the nostalgia that will shower, it's simply the wow factor in the movie.The covid and lock downs have hit every industry big time, but this is so much good, then the rest of senseles boring and pathetic movies that are coming for more then an year now.Buckle up, diaper up (you cant take a leak during the movie) and be very entertained.", "A stuffed movie": "A trip down memory lane when three universes and generations of Spiderman are brought together in one movie. It gives both good performances and at the same time a stuffed film. This is not negative as I feel the film uses its time wisely. Tom Holland will probably never be allowed to have a Spiderman movie for himself, but I'm not sure he wants this either, as he himself helped secure the deal between Sony and Disney.The nostalgia is cherished, also on the legacy of the two visiting universes, which one can do when the film is in this situation, as it does.It gets a bit sought after when it comes to closing the spell, and due to its endcredit scene with Venom, the whole concept of the visitors having to be captured also becomes completely irrelevant as the film does not play within its own rules.All in all, though, it's an entertaining, relatively touching, and a great fan service of a movie, and that's okay, too.", "Finally!": "Marvel did with Spider man what Sony could NEVER do AND will NEVER achieve. Live action multiverse. Everything was perfect and I hope Spidey stays with Marvel and in time Spiderman characters from Sony can be introduced in the MCU cuz Sony have no idea what they are doing.", "Cringe overload. Too long. Boring talking scenes.": "Long, boring talking scenes about nothing. This movie needed a better editor and writer.Some good action scenes, ruined by tedious back and forth conversation filler.Numerous awkward plot holes. Implausible, stupid decisions by key characters. Dr Strange for some reason gets outsmarted by Spiderboy's \"geometry\", as a way to keep Dr Strange out of the picture until the end.Spiderman is an annoying brat the whole time. Whinging and yapping about this or that.The scenes with all three Peter Parkers were yawn-inducing. There was one funny line, about not having spidey sense for bread.The scene at end with Parker stumbling over his words, gazing for 3 hours at MJ in the store, asking for a coffee. So unrealistic. If she had no memory, she wouldn't be standing there for ages gazing into a customer's eyes. Awful, clunky editing.Did the spell magically erase everything written down too? I thought it was a \"memory wiping\" spell, but apparently it changed everything ever recorded on video or written about Peter Parker as Spiderman.Good film-making is about the courage to cut things out, leaving a tightly paced efficient story. This movie fails in that task, and is only somewhat saved by a few good action scenes, the effects, and Dr Strange.The writers lose the plot with implausible nonsense, generic cheesy emotion and a mess of ideas. It causes a separation of viewer and content, where you don't care anymore because anything can happen. So you just watch the forgettable light show.", "BEST Marvel Movie of all time !": "This movie absolutely blows me away everything about this movie is PERFECT I couldnt think of a single bad thing about this movie the fact we got all 3 Spider-Man's topped it off for me and then of course the venom scene at the end this is hands down the best marvel movie of all time and definitely in my top 3 movies of all Time overallAbsolutely Brilliant \ud83d\udc4c", "Didn't Disappoint": "I was not a big fan of Homecoming or Far From Home. I enjoyed Spiderman (the character) in Civil War and the last two Avengers movies, but I couldn't get into the stand alone films. After watching this movie I understand why. Neither of the previous movies had compelling villains in my mind. Vulture, even though I think Keaton is a great actor, was forgettable. To be honest, the only thing I remember from the last movie was the Peter was outed as Spiderman at the end. Another thing I realized is in the MCU Parker didn't really do anything to earn what he has. Stark handed him some toys and he did his thing. He had no real motivation to be Spiderman. Tobey Maguire's (the best IMO) Spiderman was responsible for his Uncle Ben's death. This motivated him to do good. Garfield's Spiderman had the same motivation. So in this movie the villains (from other universes/previous films) were great. To me the film really hit its stride when the other two Peter Parkers appeared. The back and forth between them made the movie as far as dialogue goes (that and Dr. Strange who is my favorite Avenger next to Stark). Tom Holland is the weakest Parker/Spiderman, but he does a decent job here. His pain was believable when he lost Aunt May. His anger was palpable when he was trying to kill Osborne as well. So in the end I guess I'm saying that the characters from the other universes made the movie for the most part. The film did make me want to watch the old Spiderman movies again (and re-watch Daredevil whose cameo was awesome).", "Great": "Best Spider-Man film so far , great to see everyone back and Tom has really progressed well into this role looking forward to see what else marvel has in store for phase 4.", "Well done Marvel": "So basically this is The best Marvel movie of all time, the storyline is perfect and the characters are awesome.The way they bring back the old characters 10/10\nTom Holland is the Star!", "Good movie": "Good movie and so fun.jzushhshbbshsssijshxushs.hxusjiaiwsjsjxuxuxuzuzuuzusskwkw.jsiejsidjuduxiwowi2k2k....doxisksowooekeid7d3hhe77f.duusieisisooswwu262683irkfjjjncbxjxioekjsjdydhchydjs8.", "Finally a Spider-Man film from the MCU": "After having 2 films with Holland as The Iron Spider-Boy FINALLY he becomes Spider-Man in a film that actually IS about spider-man. MCU phase 4 has had a very very rough start with financial flops Black Widow that needing $700m to break even due to the 4 times being pushed back and costing $100m a pop only to bring in just over $500m, on top of SJ suing for $50m, Shang Chi needing $500m to break even only to fall short by $100m end of its run and then Eternals a critical and financial bomb along with China not being interested and most of Europe not being bothered. MCU Phase 4 really needed something big and I have to say Spider-Man No Way Home has done that. Nice surprises and a great finale, easily the best spider-man movie in Hollands lack luster trilogy.", "Ain't it sweet here?": "Let's start with the fact that this film has both goods and bads and overall the goods outweigh the bads, but this is no way a better film than Spider man 2 or Spider man Far From Home. And although I enjoy nostalgia and it's superb that both Toby and Doc Oc appear here, there are somewhat too many villains in this film with a ridiculous idea to save them all . So while the cameos feel great, the peak of action in the film was not the battles with the villains , but the battle between Dr Strange and Spidey and after that everything else felt pretty bland . In fact due to multiple villains, there was almost no space left for a drama Spider man 2 style, so what we get is a numerous action sequences with a lot of mess happening in the background... But overall the film is a decent popcorn action flick...", "BEST SPIDER MAN MOVIE EVER!!!": "SPOLIERS\nTOM WENT CRAZY AND THE WAY HE ALMOST KILLED THE GREEN GOBLIN IS JUST CRAZY AND THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST 30/10 THIS MOVIE IS JUST SO GOOD AND THE WAY MY CINEMA WENT CRAZY WHEN THE SPIDER MEN SHOWED UP LITERALLY I WAS SCREAMING AND EVERYTHING IN THIS MOVIE IS JUST GOOD.", "Geniuses are idiots... again.": "Spider-Man is supposed to be super intelligent. Doctor Strange is supposed to be super intelligent. But in these movies, once again, the only reason events happen is because people who are supposed to be super-intelligent are super-stupid. This is a mess. And at this point, given that Disney and Sony clearly do not understand the characters, I am washing my hands of the MCU. I don't care how brilliant some future movie down the road might be, it isn't worth sitting through crap movies like this one.", "The high rating people are crazy!": "I stopped watching it around an hour and a half. The dialogue between the characters was like watching conversations between the characters being spliced together to make a conversation. I don't know if this coronavirus pandemic thing screw with everyone's head but. This isn't good people...!", "Waste of a Budget": "Spiderman: No Way Home was an insult to everyone who loved the Tobey Maguire and/or Andrew Garfield Spiderman films. The former was a trilogy of good action movies with character development and compelling story, which many of us grew up with as \"our Spiderman\". They're classics, with dark villains who believed in what they were saying. The latter were, in my opinion, the best Spiderman movies. Andrew Garfield nailed the role of a comedic Spiderman and a tragic one. He never felt awkward in those shoes.Tom Holland's only Spiderman appeal is his look and his age. He is only skin-deep; he lacks the substance needed for a good Spiderman. That being said, the issues with NWH go a lot deeper than just the main character.The villains were completely cheapened and cheated. One could scarcely call them villains; I have felt more threatened by grass. They reused old lines in a manner similar to that of The Predator (2018), taking away their impact for the sake of a meme that was better before. It's yet another example of Hollywood running out of ideas and resorting to lazy writing.I want to say that the Spiderman team-up was a redeeming feature of the film, but unfortunately that would be a lie. Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield both had good performances, but not amazing. Neither one of them were in their element, because the atmosphere that their characters are intended for is totally different from the one they were thrust into. The aspect of solemnity was entirely missing from this film, so when Aunt May died, it was more shrug-inducing than anything else. Her character was shallow and lacklustre, and the removal of such a silhouette was not impactful.This movie was an insult to the concept of Spiderman, and was clearly targeted at small children with complete disregard for long-standing fans of older Spidermans... you know, the ones who can pay for tickets themselves? Marvel doesn't make film anymore, they just pump out low-effort, high-budget garbage with lots of bright colours and magic, and then rake in the profit.", "One of Marvel's Best": "The only problem with this movie is that it will be tough for Marvel to exceed this level of greatness going forward. For those of us who get really excited by nostalgia and action and heart, this made for one of the best movie theater experiences of all time.", "Very Overrated": "All the hype around this film got me a bit excited for it as I have always loved Spider-Man as a character and love the Raimi films (No. 3 isn't great tho).Wow was this disappointing!The story is so contrived.The decisions Tom Hollands Peter Parker makes are very stupid and are only made so the film could happen.The way Tobey and Andrew are introduced is such a bore.Every action scene looks like a videogame cutscene because of an overuse of CGI.And the rest of it is shot like high school musical.It lacks any sort of narrative tension.Tom Holland is not a great PP either, he has no on screen presence.What a letdown.", "I have no idea how this movie has 8+ rating": "Well, that is how you know what spending tons of money on the marketing can do. This movie is just an average, I preferred the storyline, dialogues and acting in the first two movies of the sequel. This movie has nothing much to offer, beside multi-dimensional theory and all three spider-men in a single movie. The script was below average, the story was average and the acting was the worst from everyone. I was expecting a bit more thrill.", "A reasonably fun movie, but a nostaligia cash grab nonetheless with a completely illogical plot": "The hype surrounding this movie was absolutely incredible and I guess that is at least part of the reason why a lot of people consider it some kind of a masterpiece, which it absolutely isn't.The movie itself is reasonably fun, I liked it a lot more that any of the avengers movies, which require you to be pretty much brain dead to enjoy them. Still, logical and meaningful plots were never a strong point, or any kind of point, in marvel movies, and the same is the case here.True to that, here we have a situation in which Dr Strange just goes along with Peter's wish to make everyone forget that he is Spider-man, without thinking about it even for a second; then he keeps changing the spell mid casting according to Peter's interruptions, instead of just stopping and trying to work it out properly (which he should have done in the first place; isn't he supposed to be a smart, responsible adult?). Of course, everything goes horribly wrong so the movie could happen (as Ryan George would say).Sadly, none of the plot makes any kind of sense. Why would changing the spell (so that some of the people remember that Peter is Spider-Man) crack the multiverse? Because reasons. Why would that spell pull villains form other universes into Peter's? Because reasons. Why would all of the people from different universes in the end gang up on this specific Peter, when they have one of theirs in their universes? Because reasons. And most importantly, why would casting a new spell, to make everybody just forget about Peter, magically heal the cracks in the multiverse? Because... wait for it... reasons. (As a side note - none of the internet articles that loudly claim to \"answer all of your questions\" about the plot of this movie actually answer anything. They can't, because the plot makes absolutely no sense.)There are also random annoyances, such as saint aunt May, who is supposed to be... well, some kind of a saint, but is just stupid and lacking sense, just like the movie as a whole.This is a movie that caters to the fan(boy)s. It is big on \"feelz\" but lacking in sense; because it is much, much easier to make \"feelz\" than to make sense.", "Monumental Achievement for the MCU": "Ending a trilogy is typically a monumental task, but what No Way Home accomplished is nothing short of miraculous. What they kept from audiences successfully, the technical feat, the story they put together and most of all the brilliant performances, should be commended for years to come. It's hard to argue with people that this is the best Spider-Man film to date. I still need more time. All I'll say is, 2021 is the most consistently great year Marvel has ever had and we should never doubt their ability ever again.9./10.", "Not the best plot": "Why? Because the plot is really messy such that the villain come to peter universe is just because peter,mj and ned doesnt accepeted in mit.i think it could be a better reason. Character like lizard didnt make a point here. The villain is really easy to beat dr octo come and some of the villain become normal again and doesnt have any desire to kill peter. And the cgi isnt the best you can look when andrew and tobey come out from ned portal. But i still give it 7 out of 10 because andrew and tobey are back. They really carry my rating.", "Why is this a 8 on IMDB?": "The steady decline of the MCU continues. Story is all over the place, and most plots have to connect to the next movie. And when you have to add from previous versions of the Spiderman just to get something going, I think it's time to wind up. For all the fan boys it's great I'm sure. However, the quality and the story lines are just in steady decline. Gone is the fun. What you get is a bad story and actors trying to make up on that.", "Love Willem Dafoe!": "This was an enjoyable addition to the marvel series and a far better formula than the usual, mad villain rises to power, steals the girl, superhero has a down point then bucks up and rescue's girl.I loved the first 3 spider man films with Tobey Maguire and the amazing Spider-Man films were not great but I like Andrew Garfield, making it brilliant to seem them all in this film.Green goblin and doctor Octavius were amazing as well. I'm so glad they were in this film.Zendaya (stupid name) was very average and hardly there in this film, as usual. Tom Holland while nice to look at was also, very average. I feel this was only made worse when compared to Dafoe who was doing some excellent 'insane' acting and breathing life back into this role.Graphics were poor for a 2022 marvel film. That cost 200 million.... Although I imagine most of that went on the cast.Well written, decent script, excitable and enjoyable. Which is all you can hope for really with these films.7.0/10 for the story\n8.0/10 for the cast\n5.9/10 for the animation.", "FINALLY": "It was a brilliant movie, that knows how to use the nostalgia of old spider fans perfectly. The best acting game was definitely presented by Willem Dafoe, he played masterfully, his mental laughter fits perfectly into the character of Green Goblin. The only aspect that hurts me is the ending of Toby's story, in my opinion he should die and get an ending at Logan / Iron man's top level.", "Astounding movie": "Today me and my friend sansith went to the skylight Cinema and watch this amazing movie,also it was astonishing experience to my life on the last day of 2021, Also we spent time talking about the lives we are live one and I can't describe those things using a Google voice\nkeyboard. Simply amazing...", "How does MCU keep making it better and better": "It was really emotional as our childhood superhero comes back at screen. It like living in childhood again. Story to acting everything is just perfect. A must watch.", "The best Spider-Man movie to date!": "This movie continues off from Spider-Man far from home where you follow Peter as he tries to live a life where everyone knows who he is. He then seeks out the help of Doctor Strange to see if he can make people forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. This movie has a really compelling and engaging story ever. If you are a fan of Toby or Andrews Spider-Man movies then you will love this one. The movie has great shots and fight scenes and has the best character development for every character in it.Tom Holland as always does an amazing job as Peter and Spider-Man this time bring more of a Spider-Man who has given up then wanting revenge. Zendaya continues to get more scenes and you absolutely love the relationship she has with Peter in the movie. Jacob Batalon is still really funny in these movies. J. K\nSimmons makes a come back as J. Jonah Jameson and is the best still. Benedict Cumberbatch doesn't get a lot of screen time since it's not his movie but it's still nice seeing him in here.Overall this is the best Spider-Man movie of all time! And there are tons of characters I wish I could talk about but I don't want to spoil it.", "Epic": "All i can say about this movie is that it was flawless in every way and tom holland is so good as spiderman and every moment in this movie was epic and i loved it.", "Spectacular to watch with a perfect nostalgia": "I have to say this one is the best sci fi superhero movie i have ever seen in a theater till date. Tom Holland once again proved by his acting and others casts they are all gems. This movie will not be forgotten for years and century. Best spidey flick till date. A perfect theater watch, there is more than 15 moments in the movie where the theater will roar and you will get goosebumps, you will cheer and cry together for all those marvelous scenes. Story Direction and mostly Screenplay, you even don't feel like you have spend 2.5 hrs and of your life every time you watch this gem.", "Great movie for long time fans": "As much as alot of people have said this movie is just a nostalgia and reference fest it's not quite, everything makes perfect sense from a comicbook point of view and for anyone emotionally invested in the overall journey of marvels movies will get what this film is, it's the start to the next phase, i haven't LOVED every marvel movie, there are a handful I consider great like winter soldier for example but some are filler and basic origin stories and such but this was something different it was a spectacle that lived upto expectations and did what most comicbook fans always want, marvel certainly don't need to rely on nostalgia, but bringing back doc and goblin fits in perfectly with various spiderman comics and how things are done there.Looking forward to seeing what comes next, not a huge fan of doctor strange but I am interested in his next movie.", "Really fun ride": "This movie isn't looking to do anything but be a fun ride that gives fans what they came for, and it achieves it. I had a blast with this one. It felt like a comic book that all of us who've lived through the big screen incarnations of Spider-Man all probably dreamed of happening at some time, and it did. That's really all I can say. It wasn't trying to be epic like endgame, or deep like eternals. It just sets out to entertain you, and yes, with heavy doses of nostalgia. It works, at least for me.", "The best spiderman ever": "Damn what a movie i like so much how was this movie was in the beginning and the end too. More better that the avengers endgame. I like to see all the characters of my childhood of all the spiderman man movies.", "Rating Things in spider man no way home": "In this film i so supraiced because the VXF is Fire man and the drama and the actions in Soo cool .you should watch it in Cinema better than phone becuse the sounds and the Fell is So amazing think you marvel for this amazing movie.", "Where Am I?": "The general public is still split on whether Spider-man is a hero or villain? However after Spider-man's last battle, his popularity is steadily on the decline. Unfortunately for Peter Parker everyone knows that he is Spider-man.Spider-man is desperate to make-right some past events, so he visits Dr Strange to help him. From here things get way out of control. There are lots of familiar characters dropping in and adding to the story and action.The movie drags on a bit for the first part. But is needed to link the story together. The story is clever, well thought out and has some interesting twist's to it. There is lots of action mixed with a healthy dose of political correctness. Visually it's great and well made, what you expect from a Marvel movie. There are some deep and heart tugging emotional scenes, along with the all web slinging.Maybe just a bit long at 2 hours and 28 minutes? But the second half of the movie, makes up for the slow start. A good movie and in the top echelon of superhero movies.", "The 3rd Act of the movie changed the whole projection!": "Let's be honest, the movie has great moments, it is self aware over past MCU Spider-Man films and it took it's lesson from Spider-Man (2018) & Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) yet, it has issues that shouldn't be taken lightly in my opinion.First of all, even though I am not a fan of MCU Spider-Man as it overlooked every thing that made him the friendly neighborhood, I never doubted Holland's acting and I think he shined brilliantly in this movie. (On a side note, he should pursue more diverse roles like in The Devil All the Time (2020) rather than cheesy action movies.)\nBut, also, without going much in the detail, I loved that they were self aware and made him going back to characters' roots at the end.Tobey and Andrew being back, their interactions with each other and Tom was amazing. We all know, Tobey is always going to be special especially people like me grew up with his movies but also, personally since Andrew is my favorite, him taking this stage to remind why he is a great Spider-man to everyone was essential.In every scene he was in you can't deny how radiant he was and his chemistry with his co-stars was off the charts just like in his duology. I hope he will get the appreciation he deserves.Them being the inspiration for Tom's Spider-Man was also sweet and nostalgic. (You might notice it in the end with his new suit.)As Tom Holland mentioned in many interviews, you can notice the inspiration of Spider-Man (2018) especially in the fight scenes. And, the interactions between the three Spider-Men felt as fluent and organic as it is in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018).Now, these are all great moments and improvements from previous movies but now into the technical part. It is like Marvel movies invest too much in the third act of their movies they literally made the rest of the movie for just to make them. There is literally an inconsistency with it's \"Cinematography\", \"CGI\" and the tone.How on earth they managed to make Lizard look like its from a PS3 game? Or the sequences with Strange within Mirror dimension and their Lair.Cinematography is just bland as it is in every Marvel movie until the 3rd act.The dialogue is really messy too. Seconds after, Andrew's Spider-Man mentions how his loved one died in his hands, and him looking at Tom and Zendaya's characters in sorrow they get in to a conversation about their love life. I get what they are trying yo do but compressing it all devalues all the emotions.As it was in a certain really emotional scene between May and Tom's Spider-Man, there is a hard cut to SWAT teams getting off their truck. Let the scene play out itself in my opinion.Overall, the movie is so much better than the previous MCU Spider-Man movies and it had great moments but let's not hype mirror the essential flaws within the film. Yet, it is certain that they are aware of the critisims from the past and it will set up a potentially good trilogy next time for Holland.Lastly, one more time Dafoe and Molina reminded the next generation how great actors and antagonists they were. Especially, Dafoe is just pure excellence.", "Disappointed.": "Movie is more of a fan service. No new characters or anything. Very disappointing for a MCU fan. U won't miss a thing even if you skip the movie except for the 2nd credit scene.", "Cinematic genius": "Marvel finally came up with a film worthy of endgameAll projects post endgame have been a bit lame and so this had a lot riding on it.The reintroduction of Garfield and maguire walks a master stroke as was the return of dafoeIt's a great way to top off the trilogy and came to its conclusion much quicker than the mcuI honestly can't see how the mcu version can top this but it has opened the door for a return of Garfield with the amazing Spider-Man 3 alongside the sinister 6 that Sony are setting up with venom and morbiusGreat things lie ahead for Sonys Spider-Man but I fear the MCU version has peakedSimply spectacular.", "GOOSEBUMPS GUARANTEED": "Sony and Marvel finally gave us a very good movie after Spider-Man 2007. I just couldn't believe the fact that this wouldn't had been a movie if Tom didn't convince both Sony and Marvel. Ok back to the point, it was goosebumps literally! Seeing Doc Ock and man! Willem Dafoe as the Goblin was the literal highlight of the movie. Although there are people whom you expected, you can't deny that Willem Dafoe killed with his role. I'm such a fan of him after this movie. THIS MOVIE HAS EVERYTHING! FROM FAN SERVICE TO A GREAT SCREENPLAY, YOU JUST CAN'T FEEL THE TIME RUNNING! Must watch film in theatres and it's worth the risk and the cost.", "After 19 years in Spider-Man history": "I absolutely loved it . Seeing Alfred and William Dafoe Thomas as dock and green goblin sandman was absolutely awesome. It felt like I was 6 years old again in 2002 seeing Spider-Man for the first time on the big screen . And dock ock after 17 years since Spider-Man 2 . Thomas as sandman was even more exciting. He looked so good in the green shirt in Spider-Man 3 after 14 years. And Jamie foxx being electro again was absolutely brilliant. But seeing Tobey maguire back as the old Spider-Man I remember 19 years ago to 20 years just brings back so many memories . I can still feel my little 6 year old me before I was 7 just felt so amazing. Andrew Garfield looked so good being Spider-Man again after 9 years. When they mention all the people they lost . I just felt like I was sitting in the theater back in 2002 2004 and 2007 and 2013 at home blu ray 2014 where I saw all the important people they lost uncle ben 2002 uncle ben 2012 Gwen Stacy 2014 just breaks my heart. And aunt May Spider-Man no way home just broke my heart seeing peter lose the people he loved so much and iron man tony stark still makes me sad. But I'm so excited to see Spider-Man keep moving forward and be the Spider-Man he can be .Spider-Man welcome back and merry Christmas.", "A": "The film was beautiful\nit was the best film for tom holland\nJdjskakaskskentnrjrkrkrkdkdkdkdkfkkffkfkoodkd.

The action scenes were to the point and the chemistry between all three spider men was outstanding. My only critique would be that May's death was unnecessary. I mean he is already an orphan and has already lost Tony so idk it seemed a little bit meh. But overall the movie was visually appealing and the script was very interesting with Willem Defoe once more giving an amazing performance as the green goblin.", "I guess I've had too high hopes": "Movie started alright, honestly I loved the first quarter, it was very exciting. But everything collapsed at the moment Peter decided to keep the cube and cure all villains. In fact, right before that he caught all those villians single-handedly was also unacceptable. Moreover, he messed up bigtime already by bringing them to their dimension and on top that locking strange into mirror dimension and trying to do something more idiotic by curing them? Pretty weak premise to carry on, far from convincing.As for other Spider-men, I've been thinking that a cameo would be really cool by Tobey and Andrew. But they should have came out in the moment of need, in action. Instead they came in to grab a coffee and meaningless long conversations killed the joy so quickly. It was nice in general yet we've had unnecessary 15 minutes at halfway point didn't help the pace.Also I cannot believe curing all villains plan worked. Maybe he should have cured all spider-men including himself while he's at it so they could have threw the future of the franchise into the garbage. Who decides who is sick actually?Speaking of which, I cannot simply ignore something. What was that electro saying to Andrew's spiderman? \"You're helping poor people therefore I thought you're black?\" Seriously? And pete replies that \"I'm sorry\". Simply unbelievable. There are more appropriate ways to say \"Miles Morales movie is coming\". I'm not white, and not even American but actually this is seriously offensive stuff.Sorry, I was expecting too much from this movie and my disappointment exceeded my expectations. I guess I was hoping a story like Into The Spider-verse. Like MJ said, \"if you expect disappointment, you'll never get disappointed\". This movie perfectly deserves this shallow quote.", "On point": "For me personally, Toby Maguire made the film. Seeing all the past spider-men come together was just an amazing treat. The action shots were so dynamic and enticing and made it impossible to look away. It's like all my nostalgia blended together with a contemporary twist of an action movie. It's a very well thought out and collaborative film and I enjoyed it immensely.", "amazing spiderman": "I was attracted by its trailer, especially as Dr. Strange is casting the spell.Besides, it draws me to watch the newest artwork of the director Jon Watts after he's been so successful.I consider the reason for its hit is: Spiderman is a public hero, and they did well.As a result, No Way Home is amazing! Just like what Tobey said.My poor language might not describe well, but it's definitely worth spending your time.", "Hyperbole": "Avoid. This movie has been massively overhyped. Tom Hollands Spiderman sucks, the whole thing wreaks. I can't get over the disappointment of it all, don't waste 2 hours of your life like I have.", "Best SpiderMan Movie Of All Time!": "Okay, this movie is practically perfect for a Spider-Man fan, some people like non-superhero fans or non-Spider Man fans may not like this movie as much as i do. One of the many positive things about this movie is that, you can tell the difference between this and the previous MCU Spidey Films is that this one has a lot more emotion to it, one of the problems i have with the first 2 movies is that, they feel emotionless and empty, sometimes bland but this one is full of emotions, which is what you need to make a good Spider-Man Story.Another Great thing about this movie is that it has character development, mostly for peter though. From the first 2 movies Tom Holland's spider man had always been happy, energetic and positive, and this one he's completely different because he just had understand what '' great power comes great responsibilities'' really mean.Aside from all the time, the visuals, the acting, the music is all perfect and beautiful and it's so great to see all the familiar faces we've seen in past Spider-Man movies come together and make this masterpiece.Overall This Movie is not perfect as a movie as a whole, but for Spider-Man fans like me it's literally everything you could've asked for, and you can still enjoy it even if you're not a Spider-Man fan.", "Alot More Emotional Than Expected": "An instant classic that sends off generations of Spiderman characters in a beautiful way.The chemistry between Holland Zendaya and Batalon is so great again.The biggest surprise was just how emotional this movie got. If you grew attached to previous Spiderman characters and especially the MCU Spiderman characters, this one will tug at your heartstrings in a big way. It's not a movie you'll forget anytime soon.", "insane, nostalgic, outstanding move": "I was watching this on cinemas in day 1, and i watching this at night with my friend.I had a lot of spoilers before, and i didn't expect that i can be happier than this, this is awesome the story making the 3 spiders from when i was a kid, teenager, and now i had grow up as a colleger, this is took me some memories that make me feel more good than that.", "Better than I expected": "I really expected this movie to not be very good. I was surprised. The call backs to the previous Spiderman characters was really, really good. Well done. Marvel.", "Fantastic movie": "Really amazin movie, especially for all the big fans to see all the different actors in the same movie. Truly amazing!In my opinion this is probably one of the best if not the best marvel movie so far!!", "Spiderman won't let you down": "We all missed TOBEY. Having 3 different Spiderman in a single movie is simply triple the fun plus all the old bad villains making a comeback had me stunned. It's easily the best of the MCU Spider-Man movies. A must watch Spiderman. Venom making a special appearance at the end of the movie keeps us excited for what comes next.", "It's amazing": "I am a Marvel fan, and when this picture came out I was delighted. I went on the day of the premiere, I never regretted my time. If you haven't watched this solo movie about Spider-Man yet, you should definitely check it out. I think this picture solved all the problems of previous films. Seeing your favorite characters and actors again is top notch. Especially when it's in the cover of a well-written screenplay. I recommend it to everyone, especially to watch until the moment at about 1:37 in time, I shouted at the top of my voice with joy.", "My Kind of Fanservice!!!": "This has to be my most anticipated Marvel film of all time. I am a huge Toby McGuire Spiderman fan and I was so happy to see both Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina getting to reprise their roles as Green Goblin and Doc Ock. I was also happy to see Jamie Foxx get to play Electro with a good script so he could redeem the awful Amazing Spider-Man 2 blunder. I also really enjoyed seeing Toby, Tom and Andrew all getting to play their versions of Spiderman together. Such a thrill.I did have some issues with continuity and plot holes. Like if all the villains pulled into the MCU knew who Spiderman was, why was Electro there? Electro was never established as knowing Peter Parker was Spiderman so it makes no sense. Also I didn't understand how Peter could have gotten an apartment at the end of No Way Home, since his existence had been erased. Wouldn't that erase his birth certificate and credit score? Did the spell making everyone forget who Spiderman was also erase all the online forums, media coverage and photos of Peter? And if that is how the spell works, then wouldn't that also erase the existence of Peter's birth certificate and credit score making it impossible for him to get an apartment or a job? I don't know if I'm looking to much into this. I guess he could have got an apartment under the table paying rent through other means.Anyway I did highly enjoy this film despite its flaws and am excited to see where Spider Man's journey takes the character next.", "Nostalgic": "Very Nostalgic when saw the old Spiderman in this movie. Loved every second. I with my friends went cinema well personally i prefer 2d instead of 3d. Doctor strange, love him alot. The magic of his is goodesss.", "Masterpiece": "Loved the movie and everything on it it's a Masterpiece i'ts keep you exited every sacond of it and to be hounst if you have a bad day and you wanna somthing good to fix your mood and you need somthing to fix it you would love to see this one it is soooo well made it deservie every second of it\u2764\u2764", "Loss of words": "Spider-Man No Way Home is one of the best marvel movies ever. The story was played out so well they could not have done it any better and it deserves all the good reviews it gets. There was humor, drama, so many emotions. The acting was very well done. I highly recommend it is worth it.", "The Sequel We've Been Waiting For": "I never would have thought this would happen. This movie had me so giddy from the start. It was unbelievable, and met every expectation I had, or exceeded them. I'm ecstatic they pulled this off.'No Way Home' is a top 3 MCU movie, and I never believed another Marvel movie would get close to that territory after 'Endgame'.", "Fun Big Budget Disaster": "First off, in the grand scheme of IMDB ratings, this is *not* an 8.4 by any stretch of the imagination. The paid ratings/reviews and recency bias among real users has reached a tipping point at this site and it is no longer a reliable source for objective movie reviews spanning the history of cinema.Ahem...with that out of the way, \"Spider-Man No Way Home\" can be seen from a few different vantage points.In one, and the major, sense it's a pretty entertaining big budget superhero flick that's mostly well written, acted and directed. There are some funny one-liners and situations and, of course, excellent special effects. However, the run time is too long and the writers tried to tie way too many MCU storylines into it. I mean like *way* too many.In another sense - perhaps related to the last point in the preceding paragraph - it's a \"Why did they really need to make this?\" type of film. There are a couple of obvious answers and they are, in order, 1) $$ - HUGE box office $$ and 2) A genuine love of the MCU by the writers, which they took too far w/ all the storylines they tried to cram in. Another aspect of this movie - and the continuing MCU saga movies - is the same actors and actresses are in all of them now. Not only that, but they use actors that are also appearing in seemingly every other big budget or Oscar bait movie made. Do I *really need* to see frickin' Benedict Cumberbatch or Zendaya in ANOTHER movie at this point? Couldn't some other actors use the work? Yes, I understand that there is a continuity issue with switching actors while trying to extend the franchise(s) along the same story arcs, but since we all know they're never going to stop re-adapting Marvel characters/comics, isn't it time for a reset/refresh? Get some fresh faces in there and start over already. Kind of like what they've done with the switch from Toby McGuire (who probably is too old to play a young Peter Parker, admittedly) to Tom Holland. Either that or just take a break!By now you can probably see that I'm fatigued of these MCU creations in just about every way and that \"Spider-Man No Way Home\" only added to that. Still, if you've read this far and are looking for a fun, shallow superhero film, and you haven't already seen them all, you could do a lot worse than this.My rating: 5.4/10 rounded down to 5. This does not deserve an 8.4 rating along or above the pantheon of legendary movies that currently have equal or lower scores.", "I loved it so much": "This movie was so?! IT WAS SO!!! Ugh, I loved it so much and it hurt me so bad. This movie was sad and painful and I loved every emotionally crushing heart wrenching moment of it.SPOILERS! AHEAD!!!......and even further because I don't want to risk spoiling anything for anyone......Like ... compared to Tom, Tobey and Andrew's spideys are so old. They've grown up now. They've made mistakes. They can't go back in time and help themselves, they can never change what's been done, they can't take any of it back. But seeing them being able to give Tom's spidey what they didn't have, for them to be able to do for him what they needed done for them, to be able to help him help himself ... oof. That cut me so DEEP this was so beautiful and so SAD. Man. Because they're all a Peter Parker, yes, but they're not him, and he isn't them. But isn't he? Because they were him. They looked at him and saw themselves. Everything in them that was once young and pure and good and hopeful and burning so brightly. But it was being stifled. It was dying, and they didn't want him to be like them, to end up like them. So, they helped him fan that tiny spark into a flame again. They helped him find himself again because nobody helped them.", "Yes Peter. The Multiverse is real...": "Review: the Spider-Man Universe (Or should I say Multiverse) comes full circle with Surprising and memorable returns of past villians and yes even Heroic Spider-Men. The third movie of the MCU Spider-Man saga concludes the High School Peter Trilogy on an incredibly high and shocking note. Believe the hype. This Movie is indeed wild shocking, and perhaps the Best Spidey Movie yet.Takeaways:\nWillem Dafoe returns as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. And he easily reminds movie goers and Spider-Man fans, why he is the most vile and dangerous Spidey foe. Dafoe does it again as the man with two personalities!Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) , Electro (Jaimie Foxx), Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church) and the Lizard (Rhys Ifans) also return, along with the Green Goblin. However fans may be sad that they are one member short of it being the sinister six. But I thought bringing the original actors was a great way to get them into the MCU, because in this instance, why replace such great past portrayals?-Sweet! Charlie Cox is back as Matt Murdock/Daredevil! Even if it was just short and not in his crime fighting costumeThis is Tom Holland's strongest performance of the Red-Blue WebSlinging Superhero. His acting was the best one out of all his Spider-Movies. The highlight of this is when Peter is crying and then struggling over the death of his Aunt May (Marissa Tomei) when she was murdered by the Green Goblin.ANDREW GARFIELD SPIDER-MAN!!!!TOBEY MCGUIRE SPIDER-MAN!!!!!The final Statue of Liberty Battle was dare I say it...AMAZING!Tom Spider-man: \"don't mean to brag, but I fought with the Avengers\"Tobey Spider-Man: \"Wow that's great! Who are they?!Andrew Spider-Man: \"Are They Like a band?\"\nTom Spider-Man: \"Uhh never mind....\"It was funny When Tobey Peter tells Ned that his best friend from his universe tried to kill him. And this freaks out Ned. Ned then promises Peter that if he continues to us Magic, that he wouldn't become a Supervillian that tries to kill him! LolZendaya's MJ is my favorite female Lead in a Spider-Man movie (With the Exception of Hailie Steinfield's Spider-Gwen from \"Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse)Though the ending was sad when everyone forgot who he was, I thought it was very in line with the Spider-Man of the original Comics, and it was a wonderful start to the next Chapter for Peter Parker/Spider-Man. It was great that Peter no longer has ties to Tony Stark (who was his mentor and suit creator) and he can be a Spider-Man on his own just like the comics. And I am so so glad that we saw him in his Self-made costume he created on his own. (Without stark tech) that is huge character development for Tom Holland's Peter.The New Spider-Suit at the end was great!!!", "Amazing, Spectacular and Sensational": "Laughter, excitement, tears, nostalgia, magic..... Spider-Man truly is Amazing!No Way home is a home run. Avoid spoilers and support the theater! It's worth every dollar! No spoilers from me, just a ton of praise!", "One of the best movie in Spiderman franchises": "Spiderman no way home is completely family entertainer movie. Story & screenplay is superb. Direction, location,vfx,action scene everything is just mind blowing. Tom Holland, Toby McGuire & Andrew Garfield everybody done super action. Film twist & powerful scene is just Worth to watch. Obviously Must Watch movie. Film comedy scene also very good.", "Spiders United": "No way home hits all the check marks for a hardcore fan of the series. It opens door to multiverse where Marvel cinematic world could go in any direction possible but for this particular triology it did the trick. You will see finally Parker in a mode mature serious role where his life and loved one are finally at stake where vengeance is clear and where the action sequences are real. The only drawback this movie had was too much talking and fewer action sequences. When you put too many villains in a 2.5 hour movie not everyone gets their fair share. If you recall that mistake is what doomed Tobey's Spider-Man. Only reason it didn't hurt no way home was because of different story line and fan favorite come backs. I really wanted to see more of green goblin. Him and doc Oc would have been alone enough to suffice fans thirst but it turned out electro stole the show. I'd say take one villain and show the heck of him so fans are fully satisfied. We couldn't see enough of Vulture but we did see mysterio.Overall this movie is worth watching and can be watched at home if you missed theatrical release.", "Watching a 2nd time ate the cinema": "So the biggest compliment I can give this film I'm paying to see it twice , excellent characters , cinematography it's heartfelt , it's sad , it's funny it had me feeling like a little kid again seeing spiderman and made me feel my age again seeing the real life problems of spiderman just being a regular person.SpoilerSo the movie is great for fans of every spiderman but its just takes it that one step further by bringing back Andrew and Toby theres no more arguments over who's the best because when you see them together you realise you love each and every one for the own personalisation of spiderman.I'm paying to see it again if I could I'd watch it again straight after it brilliant from every aspect the only sad things is the wait for the sequal.", "Sinister 5?": "First, I hated the story. Spider-Man/Tom Holland is the villain in this movie. He created the chaos. Also, imagine the chaos in the alternate universes when they returned by changing the fate of the villains.Second, since it's Sinister 6, I was expecting Venom to appear as the sixth villain since it was hinted in the Venom 2 post-credit scene. No Venom. What a disappointment.Third, as same as the previous Spiderman, where's the police? Lot of law enforcement at the start but none on Liberty Island.", "Top notch production with several stupid plot holes": "The good: The production design, drama, acting and action is pretty much flawless. Nostalgia is also well performed.The bad: The story, while engaging, is dependant on several really stupid plot holes. The first of which is Doctor Strange (who is supposedly very intelligent) casting a spell with potential to rip space/time apart without any preparations what so ever, like going through alternatives and what consequences the spell will have for spidey, who very predictably have objections. It is never explaned why one of the seemingly good guys suddenly switches sides.And ending... Why no exceptions, at least one or two? And wouldn't also the other Spidermans be affected by the spell?As much as I'd like to, I could not get past these problems, and ultimately they pretty much ruined the movie for me.", "So hyped!!": "This was a masterpiece. As everyone else i was hyped seeing this movie, and they nailed every expectation! Def watch again. I was sitting on the edge of my seat every second waiting for the next happening.", "What a screwup": "The last couple of Spider-Man movies have not done the character of Peter Parker any favours. In the last movie he decides to hand over Stark glasses to the bad guy that gives him access to...well, everything. What a genius. This movie he decides he can turn supervillains into good guys before returning them home. What an ego. Clearly the writers believe The character of Peter Parker is a total screw up.", "This film feels like a discombobulated fanfiction": "The first 'part' of the film definitely felt like filler, The movie goes in with the whole thing of peter getting framed for getting rid of Mysterio being a pretty big deal, only for the charges to be dropped not too long after. There's a youtube video which theorises that the whole thing was probably just a whole big set up by Tony stark's company which is why the charges were dropped so quickly.It almost felt like Peter was acting dumb on purpose, As the whole thing could have been solved so easily. If Peter actually bothered to think about the certain people in his life that he didn't want to be affected by the forgetting spell and then clearly telling Doctor Strange beforehand instead of mentioning it whilst the spell was being made. In fact the sole reason why the mutiverse broke apart was because Peter just kept interrupting Doctor strange whilst the spell was being made in the first part not the spell itself. Then we also wonder why Peter asked for almost everyone to forget him, instead of just his alter ego, spiderman or even better yet why didn't Peter ask for everyone to forget Mysterio and everything he ever said or did instead. Making Mysterio that one thing everyone needed to forget in the spell, would have certainly have been have the easier option as Peter would have never had to think about the important people his life he wanted them to excluded out of the forgetting spell because that would never be needed as making the important people in life forget about Mysterio would never have made a difference in the fact that they would still care about Peter exactly same way they would before the spell was made. The same thing about about the important people in peter life not needing to be excluding from the spell (the spell if Peter asked the world to forget him as spiderman instead) would still certainly not make that much difference as they would still remember him as 'Peter Parker' but just not as Spiderman. I'm pretty sure Peter had good relations between them long before they found that he was Spiderman so their relationships isn't hanging by the thread of that Peter was secretly a superhero. So all he could still maintain a relationship between them this time promising to keep his secret to remain unknown or gradually reveal it to them after some period of time, this time making sure that the secret stays between them and only them. Even the whole world would have forgotten that Peter was spiderman not Peter himself. Poor Peter simply made it harder for himself by literally choosing the worst option that could have used in the spell.Don't get me started on the return of Tobey and Andrew's ilterations on the character. They definitely felt like MCU warped versions of themselves and are almost next to nothing like the way they were in their own films. Everyone already knows the reason why, its because the two of them wanted their cameos in the film to be as minimal as possible and didn't want to steal the limelight from Tom's ilteration of the character but isn't that kinda ruining the whole point? The one thing everyone was hoping for was to see both of them reprising their roles. I think both of them knew that they didn't need to put too much hard work into it because they already knew that just their presence alone in the film would be enough to satisify the masses.Both Andrew and Tobey's Peter parker/spiderman seemed literally unfazed by the jarring fact that they were suddenly transported to another universe. Yes I know that their own universes are not all normal and are still strange in their own rights but nonetheless they could have still have felt suprised about the whole thing. The pause which occurs when both their ilterations appear was painfully annoying and wants the whole audicence to clap like seals and cheer for every time nostolgia is baited in the film. Its almost as if the characters (Tobey and Andrew's Peter Parker/Spiderman) are aware of how painfully obviously the fan service is to the audience choosing to play within those boundaries instead of even daring to challenge our expections. They also seemed unconcered of the fact they have alternate versions of themselves. Let alone the speedrunning development of the supposed brotherhood between the three Peter Parkers/Spidermans.Green Goblin was given the most significance in the film, which is saying something as since he was plucked into the MCU universe, his film is now the first one in the MCU timeline, Followed by Doctor Octavius as his film is critically aclaimed and might even be better than its predecesser. Then its followed by Electro, which is ironic since his film was considered so bad, even worse than Spiderman 3, that it shattered all hopes of a third film and terminated the The amazing spiderman franchise for good. Then its followed by Sandman, which is again ironic as his film is considered the worst in the spiderman franchise, however his film was still good enough that it managed to generate enough assumed hope that there would be a fourth film for a couple of years. Last but not least is the Lizard, which is unironic as his film was the better received one in the amazing spiderman franchise.Everyone already knows the real reason why Sandman and Lizard were pratically useless in the film as both actors were never actually on set during the production of the film. One reason was because of covid restrictions but there could be other forever unknown personal reasons why they couldn't be there on set, but they still wanted to be included, so atleast they managed to voice their CGI versions of themselves. This definitely explains why Sandman was unable to transform to and from his human self like he did in his own film. The scene of them getting 'cured' of their evil selfs was just reused stock footage from Spiderman 3 and The amazing spiderman. The stock footage reused for Sandman was him just transforming to and from his human self something which never happened in this film. The stock footage reused for Lizard however was when he was actually getting cured by Andrew's ileration of the character which is something that was referenced in the film.The whole climatic battle was secretly to stop the green goblin while the other villains were chasing the spidermans around fruitlessly and aimlessly.I noticed the all praise for the film was mostly for old actors returning and rarely anything for the plot of the film itself. This film was just nostalgia bait. The tangible dialogue for the returning old actors was mostly just saying stuff that they said already which is much easier than creating new dialogue and its only because people could say 'oh look they said that again'. I do understand that there had to be references in the film, but they have at least added more new interesting dialogue.This film feels like a discombobulated fanfiction about what would happen if practically almost everyone from the three modern disinct eras of spiderman had the chance to interact with each other.I am not saying that this film is all bad. There were definitely some interesting and emotional moments in this film. I am just talking about the flaws in this film. This film is good but not great.", "crazy movie": "When aunt may died this is so sad but there's the point when peter Parker turn into real peter Parker and make his own life without Tony stark technology or doctor strange or anyone from the avengers so this is crazy point and I love it.", "BEST MARVEL MOVIE EVER!!!!!": "*SPOILER ALERT!!!* READ AT UR OWN RISKwoahh!!! It was such a good experience..... laugh, joy, tears, excitement, oh my god it was just AWESOME!!!I was really excited to go to the movie when it first released in India but screw the tickets ....they were sold out.And then I went to the movie today, It was the first time i shouted and yelled and was excited in the theatre... there were applauses, cheers which i first time ever witnessed in my life in a movie theatre.Coming to the movie it starts exactly at that second where spiderman far from home ended..\npeter is exposed as spider man to the whole world as a villain and faces legal trouble and is constantly followed by the authorities... and then decides to start a new life with MJ and Ned and apply to MIT and do not get admission into the college... Peter then comes to Dr. Strange and asks to fix what Mysterio revealed the world that he is spider man.... Then strange casts a spell(i really don't know the strange name of it). Peter messes up and strange contained the spell and threw spiderman out of the sanctum.Peter goes to the MIT chancellor and convinces her for a second chance... just then Dr. Otto Octavius comes nd screws up the scene finally he, the lizard, electro, sandman are now in the wizard's dungeon..Strange finally finds a solution to reverse the spell and send back to their worlds and spidey does not come in terms with strange... and fights with him(finally peter wins).And peter fixes otto and promises to fix others but then the green goblin turns onto peter and sadly he kills May...(it was really tearful).While Ned and MJ worry about peter and Ned uses strange's sling ring\nand calls peter and guess what peter comes but this time it is *Andrew Garfield*!!!!(oh my god the the theatre was on fire with the yells). And then Ned calls peter again and this time its *Tobey*(again people were not in their seats even me). Then the show begins...it was a really good fight and the box that should reverse the spell was destroyed by the goblin... then peter(tom holland) asks Strange to cast a new spell where everyone would forget who peter parker is... it was a tearful goodbye..\nAhhh!! Everyone is back to their respective universes and peter is all alone in a rented apartment and continues his duties as spiderman. He visits may's grave and talks to Happy.He tries to reconnect with MJ and Ned but takes aback knowing the danger coz of him and his spidey profession.

It doesn't work and is just boring and disjointed. Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield look out of place and disinterested (and a bit unwell).Tom Holland is bland and people like Willem Dafoe are given little to work with. Zendaya is basically the only person in the film who presents a small bit of charisma.The Spider-Man 'franchise' needs a long break and a complete reboot.Ps.

This is the first time that I thought 'ok, this is not a film I would want to watch again.'The fan service was a top priority it seems (complete with meme-level references) and the novelty this film introduces wears off quickly (especially since it has been rumored long before release.)The script is particurarly weak, the dialog had cute punchlines but lacked cohesion, the direction was kinda bland and even the fx were not to my liking - although they look great, something was off; maybe it was just a case of trying too hard to fascinate the audience.The whole premise was weak, with frequent stupid decisions by the characters and Dr. Strange being particularly non-sensical, careless and possibly out of character.On another note, Tom Holland does not look like a school boy anymore; it's kinda distracting.Well... \u00af\\_(**)_/\u00af", "What. a. film.": "The perfect marvel film. Struggling to put into words exactly how awesome this film was. Matching the MCU spider man with the villains of marvel past us just the most ridiculous idea on paper but this next phase of marvel films just pulls it right out of the bag.If you are are a marvel fan and are contemplating seeing it, just go see it. Now. Go. You will NOT be disappointed.", "Into the Spiderverse - meets Ghostbusters - meets To All the Boys: Always and Forever - meets Act 3 of Beauty and the Beast": "TAKEAWAYS:1. Sooo... was the Daily Bugle in front of a green screen, or was it a production? Or was that an editing mistake?2. The entire scene at Ned's Lola's house is really cute.3. ANDREW GARFIELD! #LoveHim4. This film has a runtime of 150 minutes that move in the same way that our protagonist moves-fast and fun with moments to catch your breath and admire what's around you.I personally found the film to find its rhythm starting in Act 2, with Act 1 being a little too quick paced and choppy for the first 20 minutes or so. On one hand, I appreciated that pacing because it reflected what Peter Parker was actually going through mentally and emotionally with the current conflict of that Act. On the hand, and I think this is more of a plot issue than it is pacing, there was something about how other characters were used to transition from the anxiety pacing of the first 20 minutes-specifically when meeting with Murdock... It was like someone slammed on the breaks to only go from 60 MPH to 30...it just felt a little weird to me.5. The messaging of the film that I interpreted felt a little forced. The core of the message is given to us in 2 different phrases-May's \"When you help someone, you help everyone...\" and also her telling Peter \"With great power comes great responsibility...\" For Peter, I found the marriage of these 2 statements ultimately being a message about what people sacrifice/should sacrifice/how sacrifice looks in order to help/protect/support /prioritize (the well being of) others.Now Spider-Man, the hero, already does this in nature, and Act 1 does a pretty decent job balancing Spider-Man and Peter embodying the theme in regards to the college letters.Act 2, despite things eventually coming together for the remainder of the film, is where the theme feels forced in order to move the plot. There is NOTHING that empathetic about Norman when he meets May that says \"they can/should stay so we can help...\" I was 100% with Dr. Strange. It felt stupid and very much aligned to that \"white savior complex\" idea. They are villains. They don't belong where they are. It isn't until Peters has his realization about Doc Ock where THAT direction made sense, and had there been a situation where the plot could've made it so that Peter was able to notice all of their \"personal issues\" to THEN move the plot to be about helping them with the issue before letting them go, that would've provided more cohesion and continuity with the theme for me.But the film does manage to eventually create a clear enough path of getting from point A to Z with the theme choice.6. TOBEY! OMG! The nostalgia! And he looks good!7. I definitely appreciated Jamie Foxx's comment about a Black Spiderman... because we all know Myles should've been in this film...8. Spider-Man: No Way Home is about Peter/Spider-Man having to address a variety of multi-verse problems he caused due to trying to handle a personal problem that was causing problems for others close to him.The story felt developmentally appropriate for the age group of the characters, and really sets the future films up for some really great storytelling, especially with Peter, MJ, and Ned.The second half of Act 2 + Act 3 were the strongest for me, and had just the right amount of action, comedy, and sentiment (I was not expecting to be crying in Act 3! I felt the people a few seats from me were talking about me when I grabbed the tissue LOL).Act 1 was \"cute...\" and I appreciated the film jumping right in with a problem, but the way all that tension and conflict just...dissipates... really messed with me. It was as if writers didn't plan backwards with the resolution of the mess firsts, and then figuring out what the mess could look like in order to logically get out of it. It was just too sudden.Then the first part of Act 2, as I alluded with the theme... I am just not a fan of the idea that these villains needed \"help\" in the way it was delivered. It felt a little lazy to be honest.10. One element that I love about the Spider-Man story is the characters. Tom Holland is really carrying the Peter Parker character well, and I genuinely love seeing him as this character-he just seems to embody that \"friendly neighborhood Spider-Man\" persona. Needless to say, Holland really moved the story well, and was the main reason I was in tears.Ned and MJ were also very enjoyable in this film. I will say that something felt a little off with the relationship between Ned and Peter. In many scenes, Ned looked like this 3rd wheel (especially the scene where they find Peter on the roof... I wasn't convinced that Peter was worried about Ned being there...)...and maybe that statement made about \"the best friend\" by Peter Parker 2 (or 3 LOL) was some foreshadowing that is supported by what I noticed?? We shall see.Also, it was really cute and wickedly fun (did I just say 'wickedly' LOL) to see Andrew and Tobey! It just took the fun factor of the film to a different level.And lastly, Willem Dafoe understood the assignment. I truly enjoyed him on screen as well.* * *\nOverall #SpidermanNoWayHome gives Into the Spiderverse - meets Ghostbusters - meets Act 3 of Beauty and the Beast - meets To All the Boys: Always and Forever.This was the first film I decided to see once my 10-day isolation period ended, and it was a really great re-entry to my theater experience. I do think that Myles should've been part of the trio, but I'm also aware that we don't want to take the hype away from the current Spiderman that is Tom Holland...because we know that would've been social media gold LOL. BUUT, I was very happy to see Andrew Garfield. Like, the paychecks this man received in 2021... what a year for him!

So the first does carry down the percentage a little bit but I am starting to really like the first act of this film with the whole everyone knowing he is Spider-Man I like a very interesting story from the comics. I like the music they have at the beginning with swinging with MJ is way better than the Homecoming music they chose for that film. Then they all try to into a college but doesn't go as planned because they are evolving with peter park aka Spider-Man. Before that, they get involved with the cops of the drones and I do like the cop in this who is the leading the entire thing but then later we head to aunt mays house and my boy daredevil is here I was happy when I saw him because now we'll be seeing more of him which I'm so thankful for I hated how they ended in season 3 and now him returning is amazing and I can't wait for the future for his character than peter parker goes to doctor strange to get a spell to forget that everyone knows who Spider-Man is and of course, Spider-Man said everyone that knew Spider-Man so the other Spider-Man come into play and the villains so than peter steal the box from doctor strange and the music in those scenes are amazing plus Spider-Man winning the fight against strange with math was pretty funny too. Than peter brings all the villains to the apartment to cure all of them but the goblin comes into Norman and brings absolute chaos while I like the conversations sandman is having with electro I love all that in this movie I want a superhero movie just like this it's knows that is funny and it's for the fans not for critics who just hate films. But anyway so Norman helps peter to get doc ock back to his normal self which does come to play in the ending of the film so than Norman becomes goblin again while sandman is on his side with electro and lizard is crazy so he is on his side too i love the fight peter vs Norman in the apartment he is getting wooped by Norman and I love it than his glider comes in where aunt may and she gets hit and sadly her death and the music the shot where peter is siting at where you see J. J Jameson is beautifully shot than ned starts doing magic and Andrew Garfield and Tobey go through the portals and my god I litterly loved it how they came into the movie perfect where that's almost 1 hour 30 minute into the movie brilliant and not having the entire movie about them but about tom Holland's peter dealing with his personal problems while having the death of aunt may than they think that they should heal the villains and all of them cuz he already got one cured why not cure the rest than a lot of comedy plays into this entire couple scenes with all three peter's talking about their universes and stuff than they lure the villains onto the statue of liberty this whole fighting on the statue of liberty i love with the iconic landing with the three Spider-Man and them curing all of them have really good fight scenes and doc-ock saying in the palm of my hand with the music my god i loved it so yeah all round an Spider-Man movie where all the spider-mans come along with the villains also and an amazing performance my tom Holland and William Defoe so I give Spider-Man No Way Home an A+ and 98%", "Phase 4, here I come!": "To begin, I never thought that Marvel could ever surpass the emotions it brought with the Endgame. Wrong. Although, to this day, Endgame is still one of my favorites and with the rough start of Phase 4 movies, I thought it would only go downwards from here and best they could have ever achieved would be the Endgame itself. Let's be honest here, Eternals and Black Widow wasn't as thrilling as they seemed to be. However, Spider-Man No Way Home, topples Endgame in almost every way possible and sure is the best Marvel has ever achieved. Not only it's their best work yet, it also brings emotions we felt and loved before. If there was another star, I would have rated it 11! Thank you for all the creative work you guys have done! Impatiently waiting for your next movies!", "A fun but hollow MCU multiverse crossover": "After months of hype reached a fever pitch, \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" released to enthusiastic reactions from Marvel fans. I really enjoy Tom Holland as Spider-Man, but am a much more casual MCU viewer. While I found this sequel to be a moderately entertaining 2.5 hours, I definitely did not find it to be anywhere near as enthralling a viewing experience as Marvel devotees did.The film picks up soon after \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" ended, where Peter Parker's identity had just been exposed by the villainous Mysterio. Parker, infuriated that everyone knows who he is, goes to Doctor Strange to ask him to cast a spell so that everyone will not know that he is Spider-Man. But multiverse-related chaos ensues involving a multitude of villains, and Parker and his friends must work to set things right before it's too late. Tom Holland and Zendaya are superbly charismatic and fun as Spider-Man and MJ, respectively. The film has some amusing, CGI-filled action set pieces, although none of them are particularly unique or memorable compared to other MCU movies. As is typical of these films, the script provides enjoyable moments of comic relief combined with some clever callbacks to other MCU movies. Unfortunately, I didn't find the film to be as potent and impactful of a viewing experience as I hoped. It's certainly fun for die-hard Spider-Man fans, but a lot of it did not feel totally satisfying to me. The film's most problematic flaw is that feels like it has little narrative or structural reason to exist beyond simply fan service, unlike other major MCU crossover films like \"Avengers: Endgame\" or even \"Captain America: Civil War,\" where the plot progression and stakes felt much more consequential. In contrast, this film's attempts to establish grounded emotional stakes for neither its characters nor the future of the MCU feel as impactful or profound. Yet those simply there to see their favorite web-slinger will still enjoy the ride anyway, and on pure entertainment value, I still did to some degree.

Jamie Foxx is an unnecessary element to any film. The Happy/May stuff I guess was needed for the sappy ending. Thomas Haden-Church and Rhys Ifans were just collecting a check.Some of the effects were decent. But at times, they looked rubbery and wrong. I really didn't recognize the score as being Giacchino as it was generic beyond belief.When the film was actioning nonsense with light bits of humor, it worked.

(a really honest review)": "After reading a few reviews, I've come to the conclusion that I'm probably too old for these kind of movies. I am a big fan of the Marvel movies, so I know the whole series. Admittedly, I've never been a big fan of the Spider-Man movies, with the exception of the first two with Tobey Maguire. But let's face it, this movie is a smorgasbord of stupid decisions, starting with the very first one that carries the whole movie. How can Dr. Strange recite that absolutely stupid spell that everyone warned him about and do it without questioning anything? That's what the whole movie is built on, and also the consequence of it at the end. Whereby the final punchline makes no sense at all. Attention spoilers: If everyone forgets \"who Spider-Man is\", in the sense that no one associates Peter Parker with Spider-Man anymore, then everyone doesn't necessarily have to forget who Peter Parker is. Nobody forgets Spiderman either. In my opinion, this twist was only built in so that the dramaturgy of the film works. But it remains totally illogical and leads the whole thing ad absurdum. The special effects are also really bad in parts. The train scene in the mirror dimension remains especially negativ in memory (oh come on, you can manage the Green Screen better than this)...and it is a key scene at the same time. I'm probably pretty alone with my opinion, but I can not give more than 6 stars (and that's already generous). If you liked this movie, it's fine, enjoy it.", "A GIFT FOR EVERY SPIDER-MAN FAN": "Spider-man : No way home is hands down one of thee top MCU movies out there.

This movie captures the essence of the character. And even better, it finally gives the MCU Perter Parker some well needed and deserved character development. It's the classic Peter learns that helping others is your responsibility when you have the ability, but what's so great, is that as opposed to him getting rewarded for his good deeds, he gets actively punished for it, but that doesn't stop him. He proceeds to do whatever he can to help and to save the ragtag group of villains. No matter how much he loses, he persists, for a group of people who are trying to kill him at various times. And yet he persists. That's what makes him a great protagonist in this film.Overall, 10/10 very good movie. Seriously. Watch this.

Being a part of creating something which inspires people like me. No way home brought elements of beautiful writing, acting, and cinematography that just wasn't quite there in the first 2 (still great movies). The movie has the heart felt tragedy that just pulls us so much closer to Peter Parker as a human and Spider-Man as a hero.

Willem Defoe is just insain as green goblin. Sadly, I do not think we will ever get a movie with only him and spidey, but damn. What a performance by him and everyone else. I was impressed, and smiled all the way home. What a great experience this was!", "The GOAT SPIDER MAN MOVIE EVER \ud83d\ude3b": "Omg what a movie it was a complete treat to the Spidey fans thank you @sony and @marvel entertainment for giving us such a master piece of a movie\nOnce in a life time experience that everyone should experience.", "Far from a masterpiece, but ok": "Not great, not terrible. The graphics and footage of the battles are at a high level, but the dialogues, and especially this \"humor\", are far from a masterpiece. 6/10 will be okay for this movie.", "I can die in peace now": "Expectations were met, expectations were exceeded. A movie made by a fan for the fans. The best Spider-Man liveaction movie just for the scale alone and finally a strong competitor for the much beloved INTO THE SPIDER-VERSEAbsolutely no chance of disappointment, so rush to your nearest theatre and stay spoiler free as much as possible. And thank you to the people who made this film possible.", "The Ultimate Movie": "I just finished watching it and I already eager to watch it over and over again.This movie will make you laugh, excited, and eventually make you cry.Spider-Man No Way Home should be a reference to how to make a perfect superhero movie.", "10/10 movie": "This movie was AMAZING. They somehow managed to make it perfect despite the fact that it was so easy to mess it up. I loved every second of it. The story, pacing, aunt mays death, the fight between green goblin and peter, bloodlusted peter parker, the way the three spiderman interacted, peters character development and the amazing ending that hyped us up for the next trilogy. They fixed every problem that Tom Holland's spiderman had and finally gave us a comic accurate peter parker. There were absolutely 0 problems w the movie.", "More of the same": "There are many great indictments of the community of this site and the reviews system, none more egregious than Breaking Bad outranking the Sopranos. But this contrived, predictable churned-out flick having an 8.5? Despicable. When it comes to Marvel, you get an occasional Black Panther or Logan that sort of stands out from the heap, but this is just another dime-a-dozen time sink.", "This is not a good film": "There is nothing original about this film. The obvious lack of original ideas has never been clearer. This film quite literally recycles past SpiderMan scripts along with the villans and heroes, AND the actors that played them. I very much enjoyed the previous films from which this film derives its content, but bringing those characters and actors back into the current franchise was not fun, not interesting, not surprising. It was boring. It was a complete cop out. I felt ripped off. I was ripped off. We were all ripped off. And yet, somehow this drivel gets 8.7 stars on IMBD. As far as the acting, it was good, but such a waste of talent! I should think there were no actual writers paid for this script, just overpaid actors and CGI techs.", "unexpectedly pleasantly surprised": "In an era where nostalgia is the main driving selling point of movies fueled by constant over the top fan service, the latest installment in the mcu spider man manages to do both masterfully as if the creators of the movie wanted to write a love letter to spider-man fans everywhere. I am still baffled how it managed to do so. Still amazed how well this turned out being the 8th movie about a spider-man. The cg is top notch ( I didnt even notice the de-aging technology), great story with stakes, good character development, amazing actor performances etc etc etc. I can go on and drool for hours but the movie is not without its flaws. Although they are tiny and miniscule compared to what the movie provides as an entertainment value.One of the main flaws being what they did with doctor strange and how they assassinated the character but it is something that can be put on your suspension of disbelief and forgiven. Other flaws are mostly nitpicks.If you are any fan of spider-man movies I guarantee it that you will have a good time with this movie.", "Spiderverse is always great": "It has been the most beautiful moment in a cinema, at least for me, its like you are watching 3 different generations of spiderman for around 20 years in just 1 movie, and green goblin is the best character.", "This is an Avenger level greatness": "This is an Avenger level greatness. I love how new characters are portrayed. As usual, there are two epic after credit scenes. Although there seems to be a major downtrend in IQ among Americans that has gotten so low that almost every film makers just slow their pacing down. I'm glad the director doesn't follow that stupid trend.", "Why is everyone weeping?": "Half hour in the movie I would have rated it a 6 or a 7, and really just for the presence of Dr Strange. But then the plot got overly complicated. It's like they don't know how to write anymore so they throw in a bunch of unrelated twist and turns and then mix in the fake morality dilemma ingredient, because we live in the era of \"feelings\". Everyone in the movie gets a chance to weep in the face of the spectator, appalled and unentertained. Hollywood, you're a failure.", "I don't know how they pulled it off!": "This movie has a plot line full of elements that given to any other movie would have gone up in flames. The writers, director, and actors bring it all together beautifully and pull off an amazing movie that deserves recognition. One of the best and most creative stories I've ever seen.", "Best Spider-Man movie ever!": "Spider-Man No Way Home was amazing! Hands-down my new favorite Spider-Man movie and possibly Marvel film of all time. I laughed, I cried, I gasped and I cheered!", "So many member berries": "The CGI was so mind numbing that I could feel my brain cells dying yay!I found myself doing involuntary soy face multiple times as the audience audibly gasped at the recycled IP and litany of pointless cameos.", "Absolutely AMAZING!": "I loved this and I mean LOVED it. There was so much involved. There were surprise appearances (not shown in the trailer) and so much more. It made me want to revisit the older movies and watch a few things I haven't seen yet (no spoilers so keeping that vague).I think it sets up future movies very well but the ending was a little sad. I am hoping there is a way to fix it BUT we shall have to wait and see.The laughs, the joy, the fights, the comedy, the tragedy... this film has it ALL.The characters are also so well developed now. I read a non spoiler review recently about how, the length of time they have taken to set up each character and develop them in previous movies has paid of dividends in this film.Absolutely fantastic! You're going to love it!", "Leaning in to the multiverse": "For Marvel this new Spidey outing is both 'more of the same' and an audacious step into new conceptual territory. They certainly didn't have to do what they did to make an entertaining film, but credit to them for using one of their absolute favorite characters as a stage to launch the multiverse on the big screen. All those previous Spider-Man movies with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield and all their villains? No problem. They happened in different universes and now let's put them all together.On the negative side, there's just too much material. They did have trouble figuring out what to do with all those comic book villains from the previous cycles. But there's a lot on the plus side:I was surprised by just how much screen time the 'other' Spidey's got. They weren't just token appearances -- the script totally leaned in all the way. Three really is better than one, at least for a while. And Tobey Maguire really looks good. I was impressed by his easy, mature delivery.The romance. Peter and MJ make an increasingly compelling pair. There are deliberate moments where MJ says something true and insightful, and Peter just stands back and looks at her with love shining from his eyes. Again, this is something the writers didn't have to do, but it adds depth that superhero films often don't have.The stacked cast. Wow. I'm impressed with how Marvel can successfully attract top rank actors to do these roles. Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina slip back into their Green Goblin and Doc Ock personas like it was just yesterday, and Marisa Tomei continued to nail Peter's Aunt May.What they did with Doctor Strange. In his own movie and the Infinity War saga he was one of the ultimate heros with just a hint of prickliness. Here, they've developed his character a step further. He's sometimes acerbic, arrogant, and not altogether nice to the 'kids' (Peter, MJ, Ned). It's a bit of a return to where he started, as the cold, brilliant and self-centered surgeon that he was. And it's obviously a setup for his Multiverse of Madness film coming next.A full recognition of the fact that Spider-Man is, actually, a tragic character. Doing good and trying hard are second nature to him, but the universe just isn't kind in return. We see this in every iteration of the character, and if anything it's even more face-on than the others.Bottom line is that this is one of the best Marvel accomplishments. I actually rate it higher than the Infinity War pair.", "Speechless": "What an amazing movie, believe me you don't want to miss this one.Tobey was like big brother\nAndrew understood that he is amazing\nAnd tom understood the meaning of with great power cimes great responsibility.", "One Spider to Rule Them All": "This was very likely the best Spider-Man movie of all time! The character progression is next level in this movie and it so good to see old characters come back again!", "The Amazing Wider-Span...": "Through time portals, resurrected, they all fell. By strange hand, a multiverses magic spell. Now past threads have been re-spun. Peter Parkers overrun. By those trapped within their web and sent to hell.", "Nostalgic,and that's it": "This movie has all three live action Spider-Mans, their villains, Daredevil, and Venom (in the post credit scene). It also includes an interesting soundtrack from Michael Giacchino. Interesting concept, and it certainly helps expand the MCU. However, this movie has bad visual effects for the first hour (scenes at The Sanctum Sanctorum and portals at Ned's house have some of the worst vfx), mediocre dialogue, and flat acting.Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire tried their best to return to their roles, but Tom Holland's acting is just bad. He is flat and remains the same throughout the movie, Peter Parker changes as a character, but Tom Holland doesn't show enough acting. The VFX was also bad. In The Sanctum Sanctorum, none of the character had extra strands of hair sticking out and the lighting looked too perfect. The Grand Canyon fight demonstrates more bad rotoscoping and lighting. Although the VFX did improve for the final battle. But what did I expect? The movie was entertaining enough and it has a fresh concept. Despite being overloaded with visual effect, it serves as a nice action movie for the older Spider-Man fans.", "garbage movie": "1. Peter parker is just Tobey Maguire and other is just totally awkward esp andrew (cow)field\n2.

My experience.": "It's a stunning, memorable and entertaining movie. Thank you Feige and Amy for this partnership in giving us the best Spidey movie the audiences can ever experience. The movie's pace is really good which keeps you on the edge of the seat. Great performances from all the actors. This movie is good to watch in theatres to get that kind of audience reactions.", "By far the best Spidey Film....": "... and I loved some of the others, particularly the first two Tobey M films and Homecoming....And it gets better with multiple viewings.Great action, as you'd expect, and much of the cast gets a decent amount to do. But what elevates it is the Heart. The Death of a major character and the heartbreak conveyed by all the parties, and more at the end with the final decision to put things right.The 'villains' (they aren't all bad) are very effective, particularly Doc Ock, Osborne and Electro - others a bit wasted. Great support from Strange, and of course MJ and Ned, and more of a cameo but effective as ever from Happy.But what takes it to the top level akin to Endgame is of course the 'Spidey' team-up with Tobey and Andrew - hardly a spoiler anymore. Was a bit circumspect about this before I saw it, probably because SM3 and both Garfield films were average, but their performance in this, along with MCU Peter, were sublime - some great heartwarming dialogue between the 3 - it really reaches another level. Just love it.Feel for Sony because how do you possibly top this? Actually like the MCU, after Endgame you probably can't, but it's going to be fun watching them try...", "Masterpiece!": "I don't really follow all the Marvel movies that come out so I wasn't aware the movie existed.This week for some reason I wanted to watch the first Spider-Man movies with Tobey Maguire, because I really liked them as a little kid (only knew nr. 1 and 2 though). Now I'm 21 and the last time I saw them was 15 years ago!So after watching the first one I thought, why not watching all Spider-Man movies there are? And so I did. I really like how they incorporated Spider-Man into the MCU and I think that all the Tom Holland movies are really great as well as Tom Holland himself as Spider-Man.But this film??!! I couldn't believe they were able to make such a great movie wile I was watching it the whole time! And what a great hommage to all the other Spider-Man flicks. Especially since I saw them directly before this one, all the plots really did come together in this masterpiece of a movie.Really hats off to the makers of this film! And if you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and go watch it!", "A- (high 8). December 21' @Regal": "Follows exactly how you would beat-by-beat but damn is it spectacular. Well made film with solid performances all around. Emotionally driven arcs that have been culminating for years. Pays off. This is a must watch again as soon as you can. Nothing in particular that sticks out poorly. Maybe some spotty CGI here and there but otherwise really well done.", "Out of world": "It's the best out of best . You cry, you laugh you jump, you scream and you say wow in every 5 min .But beware of spoilers and get ur ticket as soon as possible, for this is the biggest movie of this decade after endgame, you can't just sit in your home and let go of this experience.", "Everything is here what I wanted": "It's a treat for a fan. Almost every exciting moment is here. I'm feeling so lucky that I've born in this era. After watching this can't get out from this hangover. Jon watts did amazing job. Love every moment of it. Finally I can say this is not a movie it's an emotion!!", "The Spider-Man film we didn't know we wanted, but needed.": "SPOILER WARNING! I have been a lifelong Spider-Man and Peter Parker fan, I still read the comics, and when it came to the movie incarnations of the Wall Crawler, it's been mixed emotions. Whether it was Toby Maguire, Andrew Garfield, or Tom Holland, there were things I liked, things I did not, and some that just made me shake my head. I was like most fans, thrilled by the triumphs, but equally let down by the disappointments - and there were more than a few disappointments in the past two decades that Spidey had been on the big screen. And that is what makes SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME something special, because director Jon Watts, screenwriters Chris Mackenna and Erik Sommers, and whoever else at Sony who was calling the shots, have leaned into all those high points, and let downs, and given the fans something truly special that gives us closure, while opening the doors to so many new possibilities.The film's trailer pretty much lays out the basic plot, which picks up right where FAR FROM HOME left off. After Quinton Beck revealed to the world that Spider-Man is really high school senior Peter Parker, he seeks help from Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange in the form of a magical spell which would make the world forget who Spider-Man is underneath the mask. Of course there are complications from a botched attempt to cast said spell, namely that it transports many of the villains who have fought the other iterations of Spidey from their universes to the one inhabited by the current Spider-Man. And if the bad guys from those universes came through, then it's only logical that... It's actually a pretty simple plot, some have criticized it as such, but so much is built upon this basic foundation. The film has so many truly emotional and satisfying moments that we didn't know we needed until we saw them up on the screen. It was such a kick seeing Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe back as Otto Octavius and Norman Osborn, also known as Doctor Octopus and The Green Goblin respiectively, and though I was not the biggest fan of Jamie Foxx's Electro, he won me over with this encore. Thomas Haden Church returned as The Sandman, and Rhys Ifans was back as The Lizard. It wasn't quite The Sinister Six film we were supposed to get, but pretty close just the same. Then there was the moment when the mask is removed, and it's Andrew Garfield, followed by Toby Maguire, stepping through the portal. The sight of all three Peter Parkers interacting and working together to defeat their common foes is the cherry on top. The fact that Maguire can make webs come out of his wrists while none of the others can is addressed, and it's the little details like that which make this film really something special. And having Garfield be the one to catch the falling M. J., something he failed to do for Gwen Stacy, was an awesome highlight. It was a reminder how much he committed to the part, and how maybe it wasn't as appreciated at the time as it should have been. It was good to see Jon Favreau as back as Happy Hogan, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon as M. J. and Ned Leeds, and J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, who is now an Alex Jones like podcaster, and still capable of making big trouble for Spidey. Charlie Cox's brief appearance as Matt Murdoch opened up a lot of possibilities for the future. Benedict Wong's character has been doing double duty this year with his appearance in SHANG CHI as well. And there is a twist with Marisa Tomei's Aunt May that is very true to the corner stone Stan Lee and Steve Ditko set in place for Spider-Man all those years ago. There are some interesting winks and nods in the course of the film: like having Flash Thompson's autobiography be titled \"Flashpoint\" the original comic book multiverse story put out by the Distinguished Competition way back in the early '60s, and was having Norman Osborn smash his Green Goblin mask early in the film an acknowledgement that it too it much resembled something from the Power Rangers, a frequent criticism over the years?SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME is true to its title, a corner turned with no going back, and there is a bittersweet quality to the final scene. It reminds us that the story of Peter Parker has always been about living with loss and sadness, and the triumph that comes with getting beyond them, and finding what is great in life. There's a mid credits scene with Tom Hardy that drives home the point there is Sony's Marvel movies, and then there is Disney's MCU. I had hopes that The Fantastic Four might be reintroduced in a future Spider-Man film, it would be the logical spot to bring them back, but that is unlikely. Sony wants to make more Spider-Man films with Tom Holland, who is great in the part, but I wish they'd consider making one more Spidey film with Andrew Garfield taking on Kraven the Hunter.", "Spidermans": "This was all I wanted! I have been waiting for this senario for years, watching three peter parkers in a sreen! With the help of paralel universes, all the diferences between three spiderman movies are justified, which is great.", "Over-Rated !": "I think if Tobey and Andrew not participated into this movie; that was the worst version of Spider-Man. Each of component was added to promote this movie but do not like it. Thanks to Sinister Six and Tobey & Andrew \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "The greatest Spider-Man movie ever and amazing ending (and beginning) of a trilogy.": "This movie was seriously amazing, the CGI looked insanely good compared to the other movies with spidey in it. The fight scenes are absolute remarkable and so is the emotions that it gave. Of course, I'll just say it, Tobey and Andrew being in this movie really made it something, the nostalgic references they made (for example Tobey speaking about his back and them talking about how he has organic webs.)But it's not just that Tobey and Andrew being in it that made it great. We finally get to see a big leap in Tom Holland and even though the green goblin technically isn't his enemy from the start it became personal when Tom had to witness Aunt May die (truly saddening scene. I also love how they finally used Uncle Ben's quote, \"with great power comes great responsibility.\")I'm going to finish this review off by talking about the ending and the future of MCU Spider-Man. The last fight was absolutely remarkable, a hand-to-hand combat with heavy and emotional punches, and you could see how feelings got to Tom when he nearly stabbed Osborn, but Tobey stopped him. It was a perfect moment, no words, just them looking at each other because they had a connection in how it is to be overtaken, they understood each other, and it was honestly beautiful.So the future of Spider-Man is looking extremely promising, thanks to Toms incredible sacrifice of making everyone forget that Peter exists and that there is only Spider-Man was an excellent step for Toms Spider-Man. I'm happy to see that he has grown from the Iron Boy Jr. To Spider-Man.Him living by himself now off to college with what seems to be a new darker tone (and an amazing new suit, finally a better symbol) really excites me for the next trilogy coming.", "As close to 10 stars as you can be": "With the exception of a few especially weak villain characters, No Way Home brings the punch and the fun that strikes a cord with any Spider-Man fans. It may have saved movie theaters.", "SPECTACULAR": "They really did a masterpiece. Im speechless. They put everything in a great way. Perfect scale for every story. A nostalgic and braingasm movie for all the fans.", "I am still at a loss for words.": "This movie was amazing. I wish I could rate it 100000/10. I was so happy to experience Endgame level applauses in this theater. I really think the applauses were much louder in this one. Nuff said.", "Spider-man brings it home!": "Spider-Man: No Way home is much better than Spider-Man Far from home, in my opinion. The \"multi-verse\" thing and the over-populated supporting cast translated to a bit of a chaotic story. Unlike Far From home, this story spends less time on tech, and more time on the characters and action.", "Holland's best film.": "Greetings to all readers, I watched this picture in the cinema and recently on KinoPoisk just right. I was even more convinced that this is a great film that solves the problems of \"away from home\" and \"coming home\". Tom Holond in this film is simply magnificent, one dramatic scene with Mine is worth it, the actor played his role 200%. This is probably the most lively and spiritually close to me \"spider\" of all his other appearances on the screen. Most of all, I remember the spiderverse, I was literally sitting in a chair screaming and I was not alone, the whole room. I think it means something. If you haven't watched this tape yet, now is a great opportunity to do so.", "An epic arachnid adventure!": "This movie is like Spiderman ... surprising, incredible and emotional at the same time. Tom Holland consolidates himself as the great Spider-Man that he is thanks to a good development of his character supported by well-known faces to whom we have a lot of affection. They also respect most of the villains like The Green Goblin, Doc Ock and Electro. And what to say about the great scenes that this one has, scenes that will remain etched in our memory forever. Thanks for everything Spider-Man!!", "Can this be more stupid?": "Tom Holland brings in villains from previous Spiderman worlds which could be sent back with a spell...BUTTT he figures out they all died in their worlds so his and his aunt's super plan is to help and cure the villains.He brings these villains to his home, all let loose like a party, what would happen next, any guesses?Stupidity loses and its chaos everywhere, killing May, so an innocent woman dies to save 5 villains and more will die.Worth a watch? NO.What is this idiotic plot? It had so much potential with all 3 Spidermen and Villains but the reason, Ah.. what was the writer smoking?", "Way": "The new film from MARVEL once again embodies all the dreams of fans, because it seemed that this part combines all the best, everything that the audience of the film wanted to see. This film allows you to meet your favorite characters again and what is worth noting is that it gives a chance to correct the mistakes that were once committed by many of the film's heroes.Not only did this film become, as usual, a story about the life of those around Peter Parker, namely his friends, as well as relatives, but first of all about Peter's personality itself. In the past parts, as a rule, in addition to Peter himself, there were also other stronger characters, like Tony Stark or Mysterio, on whom all attention was focused, but now everything is different, here the whole drama is based on the thoughts and experiences of Spider-Man. And the fact that this part will become a crossover to the previous one was not a secret for a long time, since it became clear from the heroes of other universes, as well as from the echoes of Mysterio himself on the screensaver.", "Best marvel movie": "Best Marvel movie no doubts. Dr. Strange collaboration was the best idea. Very good humor, with fantastic cast. It takes you to your childhood memories as well, new suits are fantastic. Waiting for Tom hardy vs Tom Holland .", "An epic, big, and one of the best Spider-Man films": "'Spider-Man: No Way Home,' Marvel's most fan-centric film to date, is a triumphant cinematic experience. Despite an unavoidably complicated web of conflicts and characters, it manages to weave a remarkably cohesive narrative that rides high on action, emotion, and romance in equal measure. Director Jon Watts has packaged the film extremely well. Tom Holland also gets to show off his dramatic acting range and he is better than ever. An epic, big, and one of the best 'Spider-Man' films.", "This is a good movie , but i still think Holland is the worst Spidey ever": "-This is a great movie , but it is great because of all characters from the Spider-verse ,not because Holland is so great ,this is actually the first Holland's (actually is not just his version ) movie i could watch ,because i grew up watching Spiderman the animated series and Nicholas Hammond's version was the first superhero movie (and the only one until the 90's) which was allowed in my communist country ,Romania and in that version ,Spiderman is taller he is mature , very athletic and he fights with human mobs (only in the animated series he fights with super-villains) so it is weird to see an omnipotent kid as being Spiderman .I hope the next version of the superhero to be 'Supaidaman' but i think this is too progressive for Hollywood ,because of the money. I hope too see all the Peter Parker's again ,even with a bigger involvement .It would be cool too see Spiderman 9 with Garfield and Spiderman 10 with Maguire and so on , this would be something WILD .I'm really sad nobody wanted to see the original back or even his Japan version in this movie ,it looks like a form of disrespect for the history of Spiderman.", "Nice, but does the beauty depend on the films themselves or on the previous ones?": "I managed to survive the spoilers for once. Yesterday I went to see this film and the expectations were very, very high and I must say that I did not leave the room disappointed. Let's go in order, the film opens straight from the end of Spider-Man: Far From Home where Mysterio reveals Spider-Man's identity to the whole world, and that was something I really appreciated. The fact that the film is based on the fact that Spider-Man's true identity has been spread is fascinating because such a situation has never happened before and it is interesting to see the reaction of people to this news. The fact is that Peter Parker and all the people who have been around him are seen as threats, this aspect will have an important impact on the studies of MJ and Ned who in fact will not be able to enter MIT. At that point Peter turns to Doctor Strange to make everyone forget who Spider-Man is. During the spell, the multiverse opens by letting the most loved and evil enemies of the other universes such as The Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Lizard, Electro and Sand-Man enter their universe. Peter finds himself having to capture these villains to be able to bring them back to their universe, once captured Peter learns that almost all the villains are destined to die at the hands of Spider-Man, obviously of their respective universes. At that point Peter tries to \"fix\" these villains to try to save them, but to do so he had to stop Doctor Strange who wanted to send them back. Peter, once Doctor Strange stops, gets to work to help the villains, but there was already tension in the air. Peter manages to help Doctor Octopus to have control over the tentacles, he had prepared a cure for everyone but the evil part of the Goblin made itself felt and rebelled against Peter bringing the rest of the villains to do the same, in the escape Goblin kills aunt May. Ned and MJ who were worried about Peter, try to get him to them through a portal, and actually Spider-Man was there, but Andrew Garfield's. Then Ned tries the spell again and brings in another Spider-Man but Tobey Maguire's. To conclude, the Spider-Man reunite, heal the villans and Doctor Strange returns, but in the meantime something went wrong and all the enemies of all the other Spider-Man universes were about to arrive, so Peter asks Doctror Strange to redo the spell and make everyone forget who it is. Strange casts the spell, everyone returns to their universe, and everyone forgets Spider-Man's identity. This was the story in a very short time, I left out some details because I wanted to talk about it better in this subjective part of me. I liked the film itself a lot because we finally saw Holland's Spider-Man become a mature and responsible Spider-Man, it's as if the previous two films only served to anticipate this growth. I liked the fact that Aunt May in the last moments of her life says to Peter: \"with great powers comes great responsibilities\" and that this phrase, during the confrontation with the other two Spider-Man, was repeated almost in chorus. The characterization of the characters is fantastic, we finally have personalities in this film, some deeper others less but for example Aunt May who has never had a very important role in the films, in this one she has a fundamental one. The villans are managed very well, I loved the Goblin because basically he hasn't lost his charm and his madness and I liked Doctor Octopus when he becomes good, a little less Lizard that we say was not very present if not for a few jokes and a few punches. I enjoyed the numerous Easter-Eggs featured in the film such as: Miles Morales, Kraven, Venom, Harry Osborn, Daredevil etc ...\nLet's talk about the two post-credits scenes, in the first we see Eddie Brock setting himself in this universe (Tom Holland's) and at some point he is sent back to his universe again but leaving a part of the symbiont. This suggests that when we see a Venom inside the MCU it will not be played by Tom Hardy but rather another who will have the symbiote on him, and it is something that I appreciated. While the second Post-credits scene is simply a Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness teaser and is simply spectacular. I end this very fast and very long review by saying that this is by no means a perfect film from a directing and scenic point of view but it is emotionally gorgeous, despite many directing and plot errors it is a film that every Spider-Man fan must absolutely see just for entertain oneself, I would define in short a film practically only fan-service but not made at random. But I asked myself a question at the end of the movie, is this movie good because it is actually good or is it good just because there are the other Spider-Man and villains we had seen and loved in the past?", "Entertaining but seems a bit over hyped.": "The first hour of the third Spider Man solo film with Tom Holland (and number 8 in total if we count all Spider Man movies) is extremely hectic as Spiderman's identity is revealed. I probably would have wanted a bit more desperation here rather than the MIT rejections to be considered as a showstopper for Peter Parker's identity reveal. It seems a bit \"first world problems\" to me to be honest. Maybe all 3 characters would not have gotten into MIT even without the identity reveal. Did the characters ever think about that? This question is not really explored which seems a bit silly. Sure this is just a movie but since all 3 characters have for years been involved with saving mankind is a ticket into MIT really such a big deal?Spiderman and Doctor Strange basically being the complete cause of all the chaos in this movie is not so satisfying either. I was very worried when I saw the trailer that this was going to be the case. And it is, although perhaps not AS BAS as I thought it might be. But still sort of stupid.The initial interaction on the highway with Otto Octavius is pretty damn good and some of the best action on display, but why Peter Parker is casually walking down the road during a traffic jam makes the start of that scene pretty unbelievable and weird.Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin is pretty excellent and a decent final foe, but Jamie Foxx's Electro character not so much and does not appear all that threatening and too busy thinking about what he wants or not, but he does seem to improve as the movie goes on.When we finally get to what we have all been waiting for and was heavily hinted at (I think) by the trailer with Octavius saying \"You're not Peter Parker\" and we see the 3 recent Spider Man actors all together everything seems to grind to a halt. We have jokes that don't seem to land and the pacing seems too slow somehow. The fact the iconic meeting each other scene happens in Ned Leeds' mum (or whoever she is) home doesn't help. His mother (or whoever) seems like a major distraction here with the change in language also. I know this is for comedic effect but for me it just didn't work which is a shame. It was great seeing Garfield and Maguire but I think this sort of multi universe meet up deserved a better story and a better purpose. The purpose just being to redeem some bad guys and have Aunt May die in that process (oh well) seems a bit bizarre in the end.The Maguire to Garfield line \"but you are Amazing, no really, you are amazing\" line was probably the best joke in the film. Good stuff. Maybe needed a bit more of this.Peter Parker 1's final battle with the Green Goblin is good but too short. I wanted more of that. Also the other Peter Parker getting stabbed and it turns out to be nothing seemed a bit unsatisfying.Overall I think this movie mostly suffers from inconsistent pacing and some unsatisfying plot points. I would have wanted the hectic start to be slowed down a bit more whilst exploring Spiderman's identity reveal more and not just have the MIT rejections be a catalyst for seeking out the Dr Strange spell. A lawyer (also a superhero?) showing up and saying don't worry about all the problems with the authorities just mentioned seemed a bit lame (the tell and don't show sin). The MIT rejection part should have been scrapped in favour for a more dark with any of Peter's friends / family / love interest ending up in serious trouble rather than just needing to look for another university. Also have the Spidermen meeting up together be a bit faster and fun with jokes landing better (see when The Guardians of The Galaxy meet Thor in Infinity War, there was a great connection there and straight away you bought the Thor teaming up with Rocket and Groot, not so much here -it's even mentioned!). Maybe it's just me but if felt like there were sort of awkward silences at this point too.The whole amnesia stuff at the end to fix things I think is probably necessary but it came across as a bit lame and possibly not earned. I do like the fact Peter sort of let his friend and MJ \"go\" as in they are probably better off without knowing him but this part sort of seemed unsatisfactory with Peter not being able to communicate that intention to anyone and even the audience particularly well. Maybe if we had heard some sort of memory line at this point it would have helped. Perhaps something that he could have said to Doctor Strange during the initial spell \"never mind, MJ and Ned not knowing my identity is only better for them, and will keep them safe.\" Again toying with the route to darkness knowing Spider-man's identity early on in the film would have made this all far more satisfying and wholesome.For me this movie is a 7.5 out of 10. Good but not great. Infinity War to me remains the truly great Marvel movie so far. The threats seemed serious and earned and the jokes were all satisfying. It all comes close here but just doesn't get to the landing.There was a slightly better film possible here. With some re-writes and more critical thought it could have gotten there.Perhaps that better Spiderman 8 movie does exist somewhere, in the multiverse.", "A movie worth the wait": "This is for sure one of the greatest movie i've ever seen, it is a aesthetic masterpiece for sure with great settings, costume and story. Usually i'm not a fan of spiderman, but no way home have changed my mind dramatically. If i should bring up one bad part of the movie it has to be Tom Holland. I'm not a big fa of him in particular.

Fairly standard.Direction was fairly by the booksA few unnecessary scenes taking time away from good charactersTonal mess, resulting in muted emotions while watchingSome cheesy callbacks to older movies. Not too distracting, but took me out of the movie once or twice.Terrible final post credits scene that leaves me with a sour taste in my mouthtoo many characters, leaving me wanting more from the best ones (spider mans, green goblin, octavious)", "One of the most emotionally impactful, narratively satisfying and ambitious movies of the MCU": "Despite being the 27th film in the franchise, Spiderman: No way home proves that the MCU is still not out of fuel and has a lot more yet to offer. Directed by Jon Watts, the film picks up directly after the events of Far from home and takes the MCU in unexpected new directions and expands the world further in addition to providing significant development for the characters. What could've easily been an over bloated and incoherent crossover, turned out to be a surprisingly heartfelt, coherent and thoroughly entertaining film, while also acting as a crucial part of the MCU moving forward.The lighthearted and comedic nature of the previous two Spiderman movies was maintained here, but the story takes some unexpected dark turns as well. Tom Holland delivers his best ever performance as Peter Parker. Peter's growth from a child who was struggling to manage his new life as Spiderman, to a strong and matured man who comes into terms with the responsibilities that his powers has bestowed upon him, forms the primary focus of the film. The choices and sacrifices he makes, the scenarios he is put through as a consequence of his actions as well as his relationships with the people in his life, all collectively work together to create a satisfying and emotionally powerful arc for Peter, while simultaneously leaving the door open for further development of the character.The much anticipated return of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield and their subsequent interactions with Holland's Peter was without a doubt the strongest aspect of the movie. What could've easily been moments of cheap fan service was instead utilized exceptionally to provide significant development and powerful closures for Maguire and Garfield's characters. Maguire's Peter preventing Norman from being impaled and Garfield's Peter saving MJ's life were defining moments for their respective characters, instead of being mere call-backs. The sequence where they share the grief of the loss of their loved ones to Holland's Peter was another noteworthy and impactful moment. Andrew Garfield delivers a show-stealing performance and showcases the unrealized potential of The Amazing Spiderman films.The return of the villains was also really well done for the most part, with Green Goblin, Dr. Octopus and Electro recieving several moments to shine, while Lizard and Sandman were mostly sidelined without having any major involvement in the story. Willem Dafoe once again proves that he is one of the most talented actors working today, as he adds yet another iconic performance to his outstanding list of movies and performances. He delivers an exceptional performance as Green Goblin, perfectly utilizing his incredible versatility to portray both the contrasting faces of the character. He transitions from the confused and sympathetic Norman Osborn to the evil and psychotic Green Goblin with remarkable ease.The action sequences were another stand-out aspect of the film, particularly the final battle sequence and the mirror dimension sequence, the latter being the most visually impressive sequence in the film accomplished by well-crafted CGI. The film also provides homages to the Raimi and Webb films with numerous references and call-backs.However, there a are certain plot points which happen just for the sake of convenience and came across as lazy writing, particularly the sequence where the characters instantly come up with the \"cures\" for each villain and Ned's sudden ability to use magic. The humor was quite strong for the most part, but there were a few instances where the usage of humor undermines what otherwise could've been emotionally powerful moments.Despite some convenient plot points and a few misplaced usages of comedy, Spiderman: No way home sets itself as one of the strongest and most ambitious entries in the MCU. The film accomplishes the monumental task of creating a crossover event of three different cinematic universes and successfully incorporates these storylines and characters into a single coherent film which also manages to provide satisfying continuations and resolutions to the storylines of each universe and their respective characters. The film also provides an emotionally compelling arc for the titular character while simultaneously setting up a promising future for the character and the MCU as a whole.", "one of the best movies": "I saw it 2 days ago, it was the first session and my mind was blown.

In its favor, however, we must say that is character has been cast aside to make shine other characters, like the great Alfred Molina's Doc Ock.As always, the film is pervaded by a light atmosphere, typical of the Marvel movies, but it is surely deepest movie of the \"Home trilogy\".Good work from Jon Watts, capable of administrate such a big cast and give an honorable finale to Tobey Maguire's Spider-man, while Andrew Garfield's Spider-man seems has something more to say... maybe, we will see!My rating: 7.3/10.", "Age of talentless crossovers and fan service": "It is terribly bad, so sad for Mr. G and Mr. M, they deserved better(as Holland himself).

It is certainly refreshing after the garbage the \"M-She-U\" has put out. It is a fan-focused and story driven film that delivers the goods in every way.

There was little build up for it and too much focus on little quips and humor between them three, which was great!

It becomes a confusion as hell when Peter Parker 1 (Holland) and co., girlfriend MJ (Zendaya) and best friend Ned (Batalon), attempt to 'save' those villains (how 'holier-than-thou'!) and no accomplished writers can make a virtue out of the desultory explanations of how that can be done (the corollary to mingle magic with science), all comes down to a devastating tragedy to plunge Peter into the nadir before he gangs up with Peter Parker 2 (Maguire) and 3 (Garfield), confraternity incontrovertibly triumphs over villainy, and when the dust settles, Parker 1 has a hefty price to pay, but he does it with resignation and renewed optimism.\"read my full review on my blog: Cinema Omnivore, thanks.", "Best of the Tom Holland era Spider-Man": "Great movie that also does great service to all the Spider-Man movies that came before.

If any hero epitomizes the \"... and through it all, I took the blows, and did it My Way\" path from issue #1 to #200, it was Spider-Man.

I watched Dr Strange and the Multiverse of Madness just last week and it didn't feel boring at any point. This movie made me check my watch at least 3 times. A big flaw is the inclusion of so many irrational and completely dumb decisions which characters would never normally make. Why? Well the writers are too lazy to think around the most obvious path to getting to the end of the story. Cause if Dr Strange or Spiderman did what they normally would, this movie wouldn't even exist.

Could it possibly live up to that gargantuan level of anticipation? Do you know, I think it just about does.With his secret identity revealed to the world, and accused of murder, Peter Parker (Tom Holland) asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to cast a spell to make everyone in the world forget who he is. When the spell is interrupted several new villains appear in New York, each confused as to where they are, but with a focus on revenge against Spider-man. As the rifts in the multiverse worsen, Strange arrives at a plan to close the breaches but the cost is too much for Parker, who desperately searches for another way.I've been watching Marvel films for a long time, before the MCU was even a glint in Kevin Feige's eye, so it's perhaps understanding that I found this to be one of the most emotional films that the series has ever produced. Seeing Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Hayden Church return as their respective characters was pretty affecting, particularly with the way this film continues the character arcs for some of them. To say that all of the performances, effects and cinematography was excellent is an understatement, but also is standard of the work that Marvel and Sony usually provide.What's not always so spot on is the story. Here though, it's the movies key strength. The objectives are kept relatively straight forward, so it makes a film that has so many characters and plot points in it, is easy to keep up with. There are a few highly emotional moments, both obvious and more subtle and I'm not sure I've ever been with a live audience and heard them audible gasp as loudly as they did at one point in the film.Last word. Can I just say a well done to Jon Watts. Sony and Marvel, Pascal and Feige usually land most of the plaudits - but he's brought in a trilogy of three great Spiderman films, in five years, and with a global pandemic hampering one of them.

Even the better actors like Cumberbatch and Molina appeared idiotic. Don't get me started on their stabs at writing humor. Not at all funny, very lame. I won't give specifics because if anyone who is reading this hasn't yet watched the movie and decides to do so, I won't have ruined any part of it and they'll just have to see if my opinion of this over-hyped and very expensive-to-make movie was worth watching. For me, it's a big NO. Too bad because I was looking for some good escapism, but I'm not 12 anymore and my standards are different now. Good writing plays a huge part in whether I like a movie and this movie was very wide of that mark. And I'll say it again, Tom Holland is just a terrible Spider Man.", "i love him peter porkour": "Best spider movie no way home compare to far from home and homecoming but winner is no way Home because No way home doctor strange character act this movie.", "The Best Spider-Man Yet": "Absolutley loved this spiderman its the best of tom hollands spidey movies yet, fast paced with the right amount of humour & actionalso great to see the villains from the tobey maguire spiderman trilogy along with andrew garfields 2 spidey movies and not to mention seeing tobey maguire back as an older spiderman along with andrew garfields scene stealing funny & bonkers spidermanthe tag team-team up between the spider-men & the villains battling it out on & around the statue of liberty was truly funlast time we seen the statue of liberty used in a marvel finale was back in 2000 with x-menwillem dafoes green goblin is truly scary and jamie foxx is alot different this time around & alfred molinas dock ock still has that menacing charm and as for thomas haden church as sandman he kinda got cheated with re-used spiderman 3 footage and the same goes for rhys ifans lizard but other than that its brilliant from start to finish.", "Some problems stay": "I had fun with this movie. The emotional parts get me, the story is interesting. However, there are some weak spots.The movie struggles with the mass of characters. The just disappear and enter stage again when they are needed for the plot. That isn't good writing. The characters make stupid decisions and decide things that seem like a mismatch with their personality, but have to happen so the story goes on. Some key moments are staged bad. So If your willing to ignore the problems the movie has, it's very enjoyable.", "Everything we needed and much more!": "Spoiler!This was without doubt the best Spiderman-movie ever! Watching all of them, both Tom, Andrew and Tobey, just doing their take on spidey, all so similair yet so different, beautiful! And all the great vilans, not to mention the amazing Benedict and the gourgeous Zendeya, what a blast!Thank you Marvel and Sony for making this possible, and looking forward to see what venom is up to :D.", "Hard way back": "Maybe I had too high expectations for this movie, I was disappointed afterwards since I had expected 'phase 1-3' standard.There was some very high peaks in this movie, like the old villains and the three Spider-mans, that I really enjoyed.BUT, it was poor writing and dialog filled of stupidity that could have been so much better.Great to see Matt Murdock enter the 'real' Marvel world but ridiculous writing that all charges got swiped away and that Peter and MJ walked hand in hand at the school the day after.Even more ridiculous how they opened the multiverse portal just because Peter and friend couldn't join College.Than it just got from worse to worse when they decided to save the villains and risking, if not the whole multiverse, than at least Earth.I liked the guy in the chair in earlier movies but he got far too much attention in this movie and I really don't think the story around Peter, MJ and him is interesting enough.This movie is boarder-lining a 5 for me but ended up with a 6 thanks to some great scenes with great acting from the old crew.I'm just worried that Marvel will not find it's way back to Phase 1-3. I gave Black Widow, Shangri Laa and Eternal 5 but I loved Loki and liked What if, Wanda and Falcon so I guess there still is hope :)", "6.8/10 - a gimmick, yet not a bad one, with some undeniable qualities": "Okay, this one's a bit hard to talk about without spoiling anything, but I'll do my best and see how it works out. (Don't worry btw, if it isn't marked a spoiler review rest assured that there are no spoilers.)Anyway, with this film you may say that the hype is through the roof. It had one of the highest-grossing openings of all time, it got by the first week of its release to the top 10 of IMDb, and even some of the harshest critics seem to enjoy this film. When I've seen this film at opening night people went c r a z y at certain moments, it was like it's a game of soccer and not a movie XD Quite a funny experience, actually.Well, anyway, I did enjoy it, but I beg to differ from all the people who lavish praises on this film here.No Way Home is the direct continuation of Far From Home, depicting how Peter's life has changed after his secret identity was revealed by Mysterio. Desperate, Peter tries to solve this issue in a non-conventional way, and things go south. That's about as far as I can get into the plot without spoiling anything.There were quite a few things that I enjoyed it. Some of the villains (the two that were shown in the Trailer, if you know you know) were awesome. Their characters had some layers to them, the actors were spot on, and just the general way that they were written in this film is quite decent. Some of the funny moments felt natural enough to make this film more fun without making me roll my eyes and sigh. Also, this is probably the most interesting dive into Tom Holland's Spider-Man that we had so far. He went through a character arc that actually adds a lot to him as Spider-Man (though it did have some writing problems, to which I'll get in a moment). And I did like the ending too, even though it doesn't entirely work, logically. Again, fits Peter and adds some depth to his character. Also, J. K Simmons as Jay Jonah Jameson is so good here, I love every single second that he's on screen.One last thing - I like how this film is not afraid to go into (relatively) dark places, which was a problem in Infinity War imo but here it was done fairly well.Issues I had, folks! Quite a few here as well. Let's starts with the writin and the dialogue. As I said earlier, it wasn't all bad, but it did have some cringe moments XD Y'know how it is. A bad joke here, a line of dialogue that feels unnatural there. Not a terrible issue on that aspect, but when you look at certain characters...well. I'd say that this film has a noteable issue here - it has a lot of characters in it, and quite a few of them (also some of the important ones, like Aunt May which was extremely boring here. She was used as a plot device, no more) are just so flat and uninteresting. I get why those characters are there, and I can't say that there was a lot to do with them, but it doesn't make it a whole lot better.Honestly though, the biggest issue of this film (which is related to some of the previous ones I mentioned) is how gimmicky it is, how it puts so much effort into fan service and as a result makes the plot really flimsy and forced at points. I can't say that I don't enjoy the fan service, cause I kinda do and it does work out in a really decent way at certain points, but it doesn't make up for that problem. Some of the characters being written in a boring way just emphasizes how some of them are only here to do a massive fan-service. And you know, it kinda works, but I can't say that it didn't make this film feel just like a big, corporate, capitalistic move that doesn't try that hard to be good as a film. At times.Yet, after all of this ranting and critcism, I'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy this film or like it overall. I had a fun, memorable watching experience both on first and second watch - some of that is because of the people I went with to see the film, but some it's definitely due to the film being enjoyable and unique in what it does. A gimmick, ,but not a horrible one. If you're a fan of Spider-Man and Spider-Man films you're probably gonna like it, at the very least, and it already made a lot of impact and buzz so you may as well watch it just to understand what everyone's talking about (though I wouldn't recommend watching it without watching the other Spider-Man films, no only from this trilogy but in general).Anyway, that was a long review. This film is flawed, but very enjoyable, and it has some undeniable qualities. I'm feeling a 6.8/10 on this one.", "Best Marvel movie of all time .": "This is the greatest Marvel of all time . The cheering and clapping it received from the crowd was huge from starting till the end . The movie had everything and in true sense it's a marvel done by sony and Marvel . Everyone should go to movie hall to experience the true feeling of the movie .", "BRUH.": "Tom holland is so good at balancing between Comedic and Cute high school boy to Powerful Rage-Filled Man . Zendaya and tom ' s chemistry is obviously electric , and honestly every crying scene had me tearing up with them. The so-called fanservice is actually a very well done connection to the other spider-man movies , bringing the earlier introduced multiverse plot to life in a super fulfilling way . And u can tell that everyone had so much fun doing this. Such a memorable cinema experience . Please watch this movie, do Not let the 1star reviewers who just wanna hate on superhero movies affect ur view, let the beauty of Spider-man wash over u lmao.", "If you're 14, I bet it's great": "Such a cliche and non creative movie, the plot seems like something out of a middle school fantasy assignment written by a fat guy with glasses. It seems as if they believe that as long they mention lots of sci fi words it'll all make sense and everyone will be mind blown. I guess if I were 14 I'd be freaking out right now, luckly I'm not.", "Great movie but overrated (minor spoilers)": "I've been looking through some reviews of my favorite movies and after watching spider-man no way home i've think you have overhyped the movie a bunch. Don't get me wrong I think spider-man no way home is a great movie and a great (maybe) ending to Tom Hollands triology in the Spider-man movies. The problem with me and especially marvel movies is that I feel like i watch the same movie on and on with just some small changes of character. That isn't the problem with this movie, and i love how they have handled the multiversial topic which can often get out of hand and sometimes chaotic. I love how good Tobey, Andrew and Tom acts together making me think how i would love to see them in another movie together. I can write a whole book about how i love Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin but i'll let you find out that yourself. Because he really proves his skillful acting in this movie.", "Best Spider-Man film ever!": "This is fan service, cinema masterclass and amazing filmaking all in one.No spoilers but there are surprises. Things you won't be able to predict. Seeing these characters made my jaw drop.", "Spider-Man": "Being that my favorite superhero is Spider-Man, this movie is everything to me. It is a combination of 20 years of Spider-Man movies and you finally get the closure you deserve. It has to be my favorite marvel film to date. The ending gave me chills, just freaking awesome!", "Ok": "Could have definitely be shorter by at least 30 mins which would have given the movie a much better pace.Seeing all the old villains as well as the nice reunion with Tobey and Andrew was cool but the plot itself has been a bit strange and even boring.", "Go see it. Now.": "It's impossible to talk about this movie without making spoilers, so this is going to be a useless review. Going to the movie theater without seeing spoilers was hard but worth it. I didn't go to a theater since Star Wars 7 so that experience was amazing.", "Sooooooo great!": "The perfect movie. Toby McGuire and Andrew Garfield totally made this movie!!! It was so fun to watch. This movie made me laugh, cry, and the action scenes were awesome!!!!", "The best ever": "It was really amazing movie I were really surprised with the surprises on it. On of the best movies from marvel , not boring at all,\ngood job everyone.\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d", "Fan-service with terrible plot": "Well it looks like the marketing geniuses are able to figure out how to keep the sinking ship that is the MCU floating with their massive hype machine. I tried as much to avoid spoilers for this movie before going in, but was left disappointed.The biggest reason for all the hype is all the crossovers from previous Spiderman Movies and a few cameos from other MCU properties. However the plot is ridiculous, and the action scenes are generally boring and drag on.The entire premise starts where Spider Man Far From Home leaves off: Spider Man is accused of murdering Mysterio, and his secret identity is exposed for the whole world to see.This starts the story with an interesting dilemma, as Parker meets with attorneys, and is trying to get into MIT with MH & Ned along with him, and this accusation basically ruins their plans. So feeling guilty, Parker seeks out Dr. Strange and asks him if he can do some magic to resolve his personal problems.So first off, the idea that all three AND Flash were about to get into MIT is ridiculous. MIT is one of the hardest schools in the world to get into, and we are never shown Ned or MJ to be science whizzes, let alone Flash who is shown to be trailing all the other smart kids at school.But more importantly, the whole Dr. Strange spell thing was nothing more than a plot device to set up the crossover showdown. An out-in-the-open Spider-man would've made an interesting twist in the MCU. Instead, this botched Deus-Ex-Machina is used in a hamfisted way.I really hope this does not become the canon explanation for the multiversal, and I hope the brilliant Loki series is acknowledged for being the true source of the timeline chaos.I was also disappointed with Venom being a no-show except the post-credit trailers, that was a tease in the true sense of the word.I guess the ending puts Spiderman back to where his fans want him, no longer living in the shadow of Tony Stark and Peter Parker just being a working class kid struggling to pay rent in the big city. But having to use a magical timeline rupture to correct all the problems that the MCU created with Spiderman was a silly way to do it.", "Wow... Just wow": "This movie is so awesome. You would laugh you would cry... It's an amazing movie. Everything works great and you better watch it while you can. The music is great.", "A religious experience": "Watching this movie in a packed cinema on opening weekend was one of the greatest movie experiences of my life.

It had everything and more. I mean emotional rollercoaster, badass villains and great comedy. It felt tied together. There is not a part I wouldn't have put in - even as saddened as I am about Aunt May dying and everyone forgetting Peter (big ouch) but honestly I think that even as sad as those moments truly were - it makes the movie to what it is. And I mean we did have a lot of redemption in it! Andrew for gods sake! I am so happy that they decided to also show his emotions when he saved MJ. Really good choice. I also really wanna shoutout the comedy part of the movie (which is all of it) I really freaking laughed in this movie. So good.Definitely will be watching it again when it comes out. But I will most certainly also be skipping the two main sad parts. Can absolutely not go through with that again!", "What happens when you listen to the fans <3": "An amazing film.

That doesn't mean it's the \"best film ever made\". Distinctions like that are useless. But I do think it's a film that nailed everything it set out to do.It's visually exciting. It's funny. It's got heart. It even manages to ask some unique questions for its genre and tells a story I don't think I've EVER seen told in a superhero film. It ties together eras and manages to even make years of billionaire corporate meddling into some form of canon.There simply isn't a weak link in the movie from start to finish. There's enough meat here even for fringe fans of Spidey or the MCU. It's just a great movie.", "No Way Home managed to do the impossible.": "Spider-Man: No Way Home, where do I begin. This big adventure with Spider-Man offers emotions, heart, humor and great fan service. Thats for the people who Haven't seen the movie. Now for spoilers.SPOILERS!!Spider-Man: No way home, in my opinion, is fan service done right. Firstly, lets talk about the villains. Sandman and the Lizard were useless, but, I would be lying if I didn't enjoy their banter with the other villains in the movie. Surprisingly, Electro was a massive improvement over TASM 2, he seems like a guy I can be friends with tbh. Other then the electric powers and being evil thing. Alfred Molina's Doc Ock was great in this movie, And I love how he's a hero in the end. That was a theory I had while watching the trailers and I was so happy when he did become a hero in the end (even if it was a short amount of time). But the best villain is hands down, Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin. Green Goblin was amazing in this movie, Willem Dafoe's performance really enhanced this character in the movie, Green Goblin also was actually intimidating in the film. When Tom's Peter kept punching Norman, and he just laughs maniacally, chills down my spine. Alright, enough with the villains, lets get into the really good stuff. TOBEY AND ANDREW ARE HERE!! And it isn't a \"Hey, remember that guy?\" Type thing, the movie actually develops them after they're films. Mostly Andrew (that redemption scene was amazing btw) and Tobey even had a bit of redemption when saving Norman from being killed by Tom's Peter with his glider. (It was also a nice callback in a way from Spider-Man 2002) and hearing that Tobey's Peter made it work with his MJ after the events of Spider-Man 3 just made me very happy. And seeing the 3 Spider-men working together at the end made my inner child scream out of excitement in the theater. This film not only made me smile, it also made me tear up a bit, from Aunt May's death to Andrew saving MJ, it was to good. I haven't teared up while watching a movie since I saw Endgame in 2019. And the callbacks and references to previous movies just made me grin in the theater. Most notably the \"I'm something of a scientist myself\" line. Heck, even the Action was better from the previous 2 MCU Spider-Man movies. It was fast paced, fun, and seeing each villain using their powers in each battle was great. (My favorite ones were the Doctor Strange fight and the apartment fight). And Peter Parker, he does make a dumb choice by letting the villains go into Happy's Apartment, but he did it because he wanted to save them. Thats something Peter would probably do tbh. Tom's Peter Parker suffers real consequences in this movie, The second Aunt May dies, the film goes from lighthearted and fun, to dark and sinister. And the ending, holy crap, that has to be one of the most saddest endings I've ever seen. Tom's Peter literally has nothing now. Just Spider-Man. No MJ, no Ned, no May, just, Spider-Man. All of that, just to prevent the Multiverse from breaking. And that scene where Tom's Peter goes to MJ after the spell and sees the band-aid on her forehead, and decides not to make her remember, that made me tear up a bit. THATS GOOD DRAMA FOR THE POSSIBLE NEXT SPIDER-MAN TRILOGY (I mean as of editing this review, it has made 1.7 billion dollars. So its highly Sony and Marvel are gonna make another movie). Man, this movie is such a wild ride. A roller-coaster of emotions, comedy and heart. Now, this movie isn't perfect. Especially to people who haven't seen the other Spider-Man movies or grew up with them, and the plot-line is very messy and there are tons of plot holes. But in the end, as A Spider-Man fan who watched all of the Spider-Man movies since I was a kid, this movie is fantastic. It may just be fan service, but it was some damn good fan service. Thank you Marvel and Sony for the greatest Christmas gift I could have ever asked for. I will forever cherish this trilogy. Have a good 2022 ya'll.", "The Best MCU movie yet": "The strongest part of this movie is easily the acting in this movie. When the actors were filming this movie, they didn't know there were going to be three more movies after this and you can easily tell they wanted to bring their all to this movie. There is so much emotion in this movie that everybody conveys really well and everybody easily switched from serious to fun. This movie was easily Tom Holland's best performance as Peter and Spider-Man as you see his struggles and can easily relate to him. What definitely helped with everybody's performances was the writing for this movie. The writing easily made it seem like everybody in this wasn't always following a script and was just saying what seemed natural at the moment. I will say though for the writing the humour, for the most part, does work but there were still a few jokes that just didn't land or fit the tone properly. One thing that honestly surprised me about this was the pacing in this movie and how smooth it was. Going into this movie I thought this movie was going to feel slow in the beginning and then rushed but in reality, only two parts that felt rushed but both are justified because of the story. The last thing I'll mention briefly is the action in this movie. The action in this movie is easily some of the best for this series both Spider-Man-wise and MCU and I found myself smiling during every fight scene. In the end, Spider-Man: No Way Home completes this trilogy with a bang and cements this as a perfect MCU trilogy.", "Here's an honest review from a man who loves movies": "Simply put, any kind of movie that gets this sort of hype almost never delivers for my liking.And here it is, it's the same old. There's a lot of action, there's a plot, and there's a lot of talking. You have script A, which is the important stuff - the meat and potatoes of the experience - the point gets across. Script B is the filler, the time in between to fill out the runtime, but in this case it's mostly comedic relief and pointless conversations, and I didn't find any of it funny and frankly it was mostly boring. The comedic relief writing in any movie ever is mostly ineffective, and this poison always finds its way into most superhero movies. That's an easy thumbs down for me. This formula is like a day in the desert that desperately needs water.The acting: good. The familiar faces of Marissa Tomei, Jon Favreau, Willem Dafoe, Jamie Fox, and Alfred Molina is what made me want to see this movie, albeit they weren't handed with an award winning script but they're old kids on a new block and they haven't lost their touch. Special props to Thomas Hayden Church, watch the movie Sideways to become familiar with how talented he is.The Spider Mans: not good. What on earth kind of entrance were they thinking for the Spider-Man reveals? Some kids apartment? Really? I loved how nonchalant Tobey McGuire comes in with that weak grin on his face. He knew he was just collecting a pay check and getting the heck out of there to disappear for another 20 years. Andrew Garfield, now I don't know if he was playing Peter Parker or Ashton Kutcher, and I don't think he knows either. I don't think he's a good actor and if this movie wasn't made then he would be putting his acting resume to good use and probably land him a job as a commercial salesman. Tom Holland isn't bad. I want to see him thrive in more serious roles and expand his career away from the Marvel Universe. His blend of Peter and Spidey is pulled off neatly.Zendaya and Holland's friends are there, they are there to remind you that you are watching a kids movie. I can't take them seriously. This is where Emma Stone and Kirsten Dunst came in handy to add some maturity to these films. They should've left the teenager stuff for Miles Morales and the animated series. I don't mean this as a diss but it doesn't help that MJ and Peters buddy look way too young for their age.When the hype gets this big, it's not in my deck of cards. You'll either love or hate my review. Now go watch Sideways.", "Perfect ending": "I've been waiting for this movie for a long time and it's a perfect match for my expectations. The part that everyone knew was so amazing, I was about to cry. The story is somewhat convincing, but there are parts in the middle that can raise questions. But it doesn't matter, when you watch this movie, most people will think of its good points. I especially like the acting of the actors and the ending part that leaves a lingering impression. The actors gave such a wonderful performance, and the ending was the most thoughtful and sad yet hopeful one I have ever seen. The movie is like a great gift to me.", "Pure and unfiltered ecstasy": "Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)Tears of joy. If you have never experienced it in your life, you are about discover this wonderful feeling. I used to dislike Tom Holland's movies because of how basic and soulless they felt...No Way Home has changed that. This film actually felt like a proper Spiderman story that not only entertained but also possessed genuine heart and emotion while allowing Tom's Parker to finally live up the iconic Great Responsibility. I expected to see surprises and it was everything I hoped for and a lot more as this film provided an ecstatic superhero, and most importantly Spider-Man fulfilment.As you all saw from the trailer, Dr Strange casts a spell and boom, we have a multiverse where Spiderman facing many villains. Strangely enough, the actual film is not as simple as that because the story progresses in a most unexpected way which greatly elevates the experience without a single second being wasted. It's not just Spiderman fighting bad guys while cracking jokes. No Way Home manages to have a human side to the story where Peter deals not only with the consequences of his identity reveal, but also with things like being accepted into university and having a normal life.As Peter finds himself in an extremely difficult situation, he doesn't take the easy way out that would instantly solve his problems. Instead, he tries to make the right choice which is insurmountably more challenging and this ultimately makes him into a true hero I have admired since my childhood. Peter Parker grows and matures from being an MCU Spider-boy sidekick into a real Spider-Man.No Way Home is a marvel to behold with excellent action, creative fight sequences and awesome CGI. There is lots of on point humor with occasional references to some classic memes. Despite being crowded, every character gets a good amount of screentime with one particular villain giving an outstanding performance. What I loved most though, is the emotional weight of this film with so many beautiful moments that made me genuinely care about the story. There will be tears or sadness and tears of joy as you will bask in the grandiosity of this cinematic magic.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for movie and TV Show reviews.", "Exciting": "Unexpected things happened in movie when Andrew and tobbey entry . I was not able to control my excitement really i was totally surprised I can't explain it in word.", "I love it......!": "I knew it from the beginning that this movie will be a blast! And yes every moment of it was...!It is hard to explain it in word how good Spider-Man movie this is...\nI used to thought Spider-Man 2 was unbeatable but this no way home had beaten it...", "Tom Holland cements his place as the best spidey actor": "Spider man has always been my favourite character, due to the nostalgia of reading the comic as a kid, or just the characters sheer brilliance. In the last two movies that Holland did as spider man, I was slightly disappointed because we only got to see a child who was constantly babied by Tony Stark. The Spider-Man who we watched in Homecoming and Far From Home hadn't really earned his place in my heart, with Holland's childish charm being over used and making the character of Peter Parker a boy who frankly doesn't live up to the standard set by his predecessors. In this movie however, not only did it give me a nerdgasm due to the fantastic ensemble cast, but I finally got to see Holland flex his acting muscles and show me whey he was cast in his role and why he has reached his levels of stardom.This movie was brilliant. The emotional themes which were laced into he movie kept the plot moving, with Holland, Willem Dafoe and Marissa Tomei showing us why they were truly hired. Unlike previous Spidey movies like TASM and Far From Home, this one truly captured my attention and boasted the elements of Spidey that I love so much.I will admit that when going into the movie, I was very hesitant about them bringing back the old Spider Men and villains, because I believed that they were better left untouched, but after watching the movie, all of my negative thoughts were blown away. Each villain gets their own time to shine, each of them harness their old selves whilst also elevating their characteristics.Toby and Andrew both come back, something which elicited screams of joy from everyone in the theatre. They were brilliant. Toby was calm but excited, mature but fun, wise but still held that social awkwardness that we all adored back in the day. Andrew in my opinion, was way better as Spidey in this movie than any of his own. There was a pure emotion behind Andrew's Spidey and we finally get to see why he was cast as Spidey. It worked. Having three socially awkward super powered nerds somehow worked.I won't lie when I say that this is by far my favourite Spidey movie of all time. There were so many tear jerker moments in the movie, with Tom Holland standing out in all of them. He finally showed me SPIDER-MAN in capital letters. His character's emotions were so believable due to the way in which he portrayed them. His character came across as human, as someone who makes mistakes and then seeks ways to fix it, in order to keep those who he loves safe.The classic uncle Ben line gets dropped multiple times in this movie, finally making this 'Home' trilogy as Holland's Spidey's origin story in a sense. We see how the famous Uncle Ben quote truly makes an impact on Peter at the end, making us cry with tears of sadness but also pride.My words cannot express how much I loved this movie. Especially that final scene.", "Genuinely poignant, funny, and entertaining": "One of the better of the 9 films, and probably the best in this series. The film is genially about loss, responsibility, and what we do to fill in the holes in our lives. It's also a fun romp while at it. That said, there are some gaping plot problems that make your scream - \"really?\"", "Great.": "Spoiler free review:\nThe story of the film was not the best, but the film was still amazing.

It's hard to say if this is my favorite Marvel movie because it still has competition in general (just other movies that I really like), but there is no experience like it.", "Exceeded all my expectations\ud83d\ude0d": "I was afraid that NWH would also be as bad as Spiderman 3 or TASM 2 with so many characters being involved. Nothing like that happened here. It was smart writing, everybody did their parts perfectly. Willem Dafoe is the real MVP of this movie which came in as a Surprise for me as I wasn't expecting much from him. As a good Spiderman movie, it had emotions, drama and humour. Go watch it, before anyone spoils it.", "struggling 7": "Nothing anyone hasnt seen before.Its not a bad movie, but its target audience is millennials and under. Way too much CGI for my liking. The movie's attempt to evoke any emotional feelings failed and it was difficult to stay engaged. It was all very generic and unremarkable.", "Some great moments in a brilliant film!": "Spiderman: No Way Home.The only thing that upset me about this film was that the title doesn't make an awful lot of sense until right to the end, and then it's a little disappointing / saddening to say the least.The ensemble cast give a hell of a performance, and I have to say I think Andrew Garfield is actually better in this film than either of his two solo outings. Toby Maguire wasn't CGI'd back to his youth, but rather masterfully portrayed as a mature, wiser Spiderman which was brilliant.Kevin Feige and the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe juggernaut can be rightly proud of this, and a hat tip to Sony for agreeing to license/share everything necessary for the MCU to have every iteration of Spiderman (*and possibly a new Venom???) inside it.Great work, and the Dr Strange teaser trailer right at the very end of the credits was worth staying for. Superb film all round.", "Happily surprised.": "I'm impressed at the ability to fit so many things into one movie. And also somewhat frustrated at Kevin Feige's insistence upon making us cry every few years.Apparently there is a gay Spider-Man in the multiverse.", "\"It's all about family\"": "First of all, this is 100% worth seeing in theaters.. with all the fans clapping (even those that do it for a few seconds and stopping after no-one else joins in during the credits) and screaming at every little thing that shows up on the screen....\nAs a Spider-Man movie, it doesn't get more Spider-y than this, with the amount of characters and how they are handled. It's not an Avengers-level movie, but reminds of it and yet feels more grounded and \"smaller in scale\" (quite similar to Far From Home). The sum of it's parts make for a very dense script, while keeping consistency of theme and tone throughout. There aren't any \"lows\" as I felt it's predecessor had, but the highs (outside of some particular elements for people invested in the franchise) aren't as highs as the whole concept and creativity of Mysteryo's reveal in the previous entry. It's hard to explain.. but I think of it as a lot of little pieces put together in a way that it feels grander as an experience that's hard to disappoint, yet the divisions of the puzzle-parts are quite clear and noticeable.If this is your first Spider-Man.. It might not get you there. And any Dr Strange fan might find this a complete travesty to his character as it was introduced! I sure did. But personally, and considering what they went for, it's hard to think about anything I was unhappy with or things I would change (aside from Stephen Strange), which is a good sign on any viewing! Had more serious and emotional bits than expected, great action as well. This is clearly fabricated to be as \"hype\" as it is because it was fabricated with a lot of love and respect for what it has been since Avi Arad.", "This movie STANDS OUT from its predecessors!!": "\"Marvels still got it folks\", I guess that statement all on its own sums up the review for Spider-Man : No Way Home. In this post End Game era we have to admit we were all wondering how can marvel top that phenomenal movie now that most of the original cast have parted ways from the Studio, although we did see glimmers of hope here and there with Marvels entry into the OTT space and it's new initiatives such as Shang Chi and Eternals, I still felt that there was something lacking with the new direction and not sure if they could achieve that same magic again.But boy did marvel prove not just me but all the doubters wrong with this Spider-Man movie, not giving away any spoilers but this feels like a true Spider-Man flick after a long time. We see Peter reeling with the after effects of what happened in Far from home which not only affects him this time but the people closest to him. It was nice to see everyone in the movie more involved in the story than before , MJ, Ned, Happy, Aunt May, etc are no longer side characters with fleeting impacts, they have a purpose in this movie and that's to help Peter make the right choice and not the best choice for him.Benedict Cumberbatch is back as the mystical Doctor Strange but not like how hardcore Sherlock fans would have wanted , he actually takes a break from most of the sequences but makes his presence feel desirable and not overbearing.Classic villains like Doc Oc , Green Goblin, Electro, Lizard, Sandman play their roles exceptionally well. They don't drag the story too far to make it tiresome nor does their presence feel diminished, Jon watts actually did quite well in bringing a Russo Brothers like experience.Oh and I know that YouTube is totally flooded with leaks and you guys would already know the big twist that marvel wanted to drop on us but in the interest of preserving the essence of the movie am not gonna spoil it for you folks u better watch it in the theaters and enjoy it while you can.Absolutely fantastic. 10/10.", "overhyped....nostalgic af": "Another overrated movie from marvel....the only good thing here is the fact that you saw beloved characters (not all of them) from previous generations, and especially the moments between the three spider men ....that's it....nothing else\nnow, for the bad things\nthe acting is mediocre, not that you need it in this kind of movies....the story is a freaking joke, full of plot holes and questions...spider man is a complete idiot in this movie....everything he does has no meaning and bad results.....doctor strange does what he does best....hands....except now he can do spells that effects not just the entire planet, not just the universe ,but the whole f_ck_ng multiverse.....and he has cages that imprisons anyone with just a beam thrown at them....too bad he didn't thought of using that to thanos....despite that though, he is humiliated by peter in his own f_c_i_g demension\nwhat else? The rest of the fighting is not bad, but i still think that there is no realistic way to beat electro or sandman....but they did it...with \"cures\", with science b1tches.Next, i am really not fan of the starting scenes , where people start hating on spiderman for \"killing\" mysterio, and in general making his and his loved ones' lifes terrible....i mean, how can a hero who has done all these things stay calm about it and care only about not being able to go to f_cki_g MIT with his friends?? I would be furious, i would go in front of a camera and said that i should had left thanos kill you all, or something like \"how about i take a break for a month, let's see if you like me then\".That's it....in conclusion...8.6??? Go get a life idiots because you are propably bots anyway.", "Best. Marvel. Film. Ever.": "I really don't need to say anything else, it's an incredible ride from start to finish and I do mean right to the end credits! It has everything you could want and more.", "If I could rate more than 10/10 I would!": "This was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The energy in the theatre was electrifying! If you like Spider-Man even a little bit, you NEED to see this movie!!!!", "Fan Service of the Best Variety": "This movie is pure fanservice, but it (mostly) feels earned and true to what the original films they're pulling from. It never feels like it's butchering the classic characters to fit them within the MCU, and even though some are underutilised, they always do the characters justice.", "FAN SERVICE!": "This movie is so freaking awesome!If you are a real fan of comic books, it is impossible not to be emotional, or even reflect how lucky we are...This movie is the ultimate fan service! Is something that we all wanted, speculated and dreamed about.The main implications of the movie, are centered, in Peter's identity and how he wants to discover himself, both as a hero and a normal person (\"Who Am I\"). Consequently, the movie is a emancipation of Peter Parker in general, which is great, because there is a incredible, and needed, charactee development.Additionally, the antagonists and villains, are also a main aspect of the video, that opens up for the idea and possibilities for the Multiverse. It is crazy, to see all these amazing villains, from different Spider-movies, and it is impossible not to be thrilled with the idea, of they \"reunioun\".William Dafoe, is amazing in this movie... His performance was incredible, and he stole all the gaze of the other villains... what a great actor!The final outcome, for all these characters, is pretty good, and makes up for the whole idea of \"second chances\".Also, the movie has a lot of tension, and emotional aspects that were set up perfectly, in the right pace for the plot's continuity, and right time.The direction is top notch! Jon Watts, probably made the best Spider-Man trilogy, considering the character development and how he understood the assignment for these iconic character.Another important feature, is the references to the MCU, which were expected, but some of them, were surprisingly well prepared for this type of cinematic experience (THEY KNOW HOW TO MAKES US SCREAM AND SHOUT).", "Wowww": "Amazing. Film review and let you know that you are interested and have been working on and have to be able and willing and then we can get the office of talking with you and your phone and then we will need a quiet day \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c the office \ud83d\ude1c a good day please see attached file is scanned image in PDF format.", "It's really cool": "If you didn't watch the previous incarnations of Spider-Man, do it first, because some characters make a cameo. But it's well done! This film is entertaining and yes, there's a lot of \"fan service\", but there's nothing wrong with that, it's actually part of the charm. I think the end was satisfactory as well, because Holland's Spidey becomes more like the original (without Iron Man holding his hand). There is no political correctness nonsense in this film, thank heavens, just a ton of action, some good jokes and some character building. It is meant for Sipder-Man fans though, so if you are a Spidey fan, just watch it. You won't regret it.", "Feeling at Home": "What a satisfying cinematic experience! I'd still have to re-watch the movie at home, just to peel the collective from the personal, the impression and hype from where I actually am, before I put it in the same category as Raimi's \"Spider-Man 2\" (which I adore), or even this iteration's \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" that I liked quite a bit (in fact, it's my Top 5 MCU movie so far). Now, \"Far From Home\" is the phenomenon of 2021, so I need not waste words on the details about the movie itself. Instead, let me share a couple of anecdotes from the theatre where I saw it:1. There were a couple of little girls behind me at the theatre, OMG-this and OMG-that on pretty much everything flashy, in short, having the time of their lives, and I couldn't help but find it amusing (something which I don't think would be the case if I weren't a father myself). Now, throughout the movie, they didn't say a single thing about the Lizard, yet when it finally became Dr. Connors, one of them shouted a very distinct, \"Yuck!\" (I think even Rhys Ifans would find this one hilarious.)2. The first time we saw Maguire, I caught a glimpse of my friend - there was a huge grin on his face and I spontaneously mimicked one on my own. For the post-credit scenes, the theatre was emptied except for a dozen or so people who were approximately our age (we're both in our late thirties), the audience that got introduced to and hooked on the Spider-Man two decades ago. \"Man, Tobey's old\", whispered the friend as if he was fighting back tears, also talking about all of us that stayed not to see what comes next, but to say goodbye to Tobey once again.", "One of my best cinema experiences": "I did not follow all of the MCU movies, but I went to watch this movie with some friends.Loved the reaction of the audience, combined with the great movie that it was.", "Khan Review": "I only watched this movie for my daughter as expected was disappointed. As a kid I had watched Indian first 3D movie CHOTA CHETAN, today's generation must have not even heard about it. No 3D movie was able to beat CHOTA CHETAN till date hollywood included. I still had hope with Spider Man being a big budget hollywood movie I felt they will at least time will do wonderful job. Spider man is one of the best subject for 3D but sadly completely wasted. It could have been one of the best 3D movies but very very badly executed. Start to end it could have been a best experience for the viewers, others may not be able to understand my criticism they have to watch first Indian 3D movie Chota chetan to understand it.", "Great Spider-Man Film": "No Way Home was a great film! The interaction and relationship between the three Spider-Men was the best part of the movie. However, neither is this the best comic book movie nor is it the best Marvel movie. There some plot holes that hold this movie back. For example, Ned being able to all of a sudden open portals following the underwhelming entries of Tobey and Andrew. There are some factors that hold this movie back. On a different note, Tom Holland's acting was incredible, and the overall storyline was pretty well done.", "Great film, fun & emotional": "I'm writing this minutes after my second viewing. I was worried my rating (9.0) may have been heavily nostalgia based. And, after a second watch, I can confidently say it's not only nostalgia. This is a great film! One thing the MCU has gotten right, across the board, is in their casting. Tom Holland is wonderful as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. His range as an actor is phenomenal. He handles comedy, drama and action seamlessly. Holland, along with Zendaya and Jacob Batalon make a fantastic trio. They play off of each other wonderfully.Cumberbatch as Strange, once again, delivers. His role as a mentor of sorts to Peter is great. His line to Peter, atop the Statue of Liberty, 'everyone who knows and loves you, we....' and with that, Strange has a catch in his voice. That one moment shows how much he's grown to care for and admire Peter. He and Holland have great chemistry.Now to the nostalgia! Maguire, Garfield, Molina, Dafoe, Foxx, Haden Church, Ifans and Simmons! This was fantastic! The writing, the story, the interactions and call backs were all done wonderfully. Seeing Maguire & Molina together, Garfield & Foxx, the interactions between all the villains was great fun! Doc Ock's ark, for me, was the best of the bunch. Seeing him be redeemed was beautiful. Garfield, getting his redemption for Gwen's death was also a truly beautiful moment. Garfield seemed like he was having an absolute blast, as did Dafoe & Molina. All three were huge huge highlights.Aunt May's ending was an absolute gut punch. I didn't see it coming and maybe I should have. But her death was as emotional a moment as the MCU has had. (Minus Tony in Endgame, or any hero deaths from Infinity War). Marisa Tomei will be missed.All in all this was a great film, with tons of fun and emotion. Favreau's Happy Hogan didn't really have a place here. It seemed he was there just for his apartment and the Stark tech he had hidden away. Other than that, he offered nothing to the film. I love Favreau, he started all of this (along with RDJ) but he was not needed here. I hope we get to see both Maguire and Garfield return again down the line. They showed that all 3 of these actors, in their own way, have made Spider-Man/Peter Parker their own. And each iteration can be great without taking away from the others.", "The best superhero movie I ever seen in my life": "I just watched. I laughed, I cried and now I'm fully satisfied. My dreams comes true. This is \"THE\" best superhero movie I ever seen in my life \ud83d\ude2d. Please I request you all to watch this movie in theater because you will never get this big screen opportunity in your life.", "A perfect Spiderman movie...": "Literally couldn't have been better. The action... The emotion... The heart... The everything in this movie was as good as you'll ever see. At times it didn't even feel like I was watching a superhero flick, but a heartfelt drama instead. Get to the big screen to see this movie, because its the sort of movie that needs to be seen at the theater. Could not have been any better.", "With Great Power...": "As a Spidey fan since I was very young, ive seen all the Spidey films imaginable and this is without a shadow of a doubt the BEST Spider-Man movie ever made and maybe the best MCU movie made as well. The quality is off the charts, the villains are understandable and Tom Holland gives his greatest acting performance and most adult film yet. It's powerful, emotional and absolutely epic.. and if this is the last we see of Tom as Spidey then all I can say is bravo you absolute BEAST. I bow, you are the best!!", "We're being force fed sugar and being told its healthy cause it's sweet": "I guess anything can pass as good these days as long as the poop gets packaged with a neat ribbon.I will avoid spoilers besides from what we know from the trailers.Despite the things that happen in this movie that tingle my 2002-ness, there is nothing beyond that. I cannot believe people are ok with Marvel making every movie a very long and complex sitcom episode, where there is a status quo, it gets broken beyond repair and at the end a magical entity creates a loop in quantum space magic to stop the vortex from spreading into the multiverse and POOF, back to the status quo.The jokes are cheap, the vfx are cheap (not poorly made, just uncreatively used), the action is dull (apart from the mediocre final fight scene, serviceable) and all of the emotion is coerced out of us through nostalgia bait and just god-awful writing.I still love Tom Holland, even though he is a vessel for lesser writers, and I liked most performances in this movie, because lets face it, if the vfx, actors, sets, costumes and other technical aspects of a marvel movie are subpar, its unacceptable. Nobody seems to mind the contrived and uncreative writing though.They disrespected \"the bridge villain\" and did an ok job respecting the \"other bridge villain that comes later\". The other villains are bad and don't even get a chance to say anything once their story ends.Sad attempt at a movie, very very powerful nostalgia bait. I fell for it though, they got me.I will never forgive myself.", "NOSTALGIA AND HEART": "Nostalgia and heart is what defines the third installment in the MCU Spiderman film.The film starts with Peter's identity revealed to the world, and what follows in a world of mobile phones, paparazzi and The Daily Bugle - both fame and ignominy. One fallout is the rejection by MIT of not just Peter's college application but also of friends MJ (a charming Zendaya) and Ned (a winsome Batalon). It's this that ultimately drives Peter to ask Dr Strange to turn the clock back to the time before his identity was revealed or, if not that, to make people forget who he was.Superheroes nowadays can't just have fun and beat the bad guys. There has to be a larger purpose to their gift. What Peter chooses at this point is set to have consequences that he doesn't really think through - or the film even lets him face.The creatures who step out of the parallel universes into ours are a lot more fun. Molina has the meatiest screen presence and gets his own delectable fight on a bridge, complete with dangling cars and swinging men and women. Dafoe largely snarls and gnarls, but when they do get together, the actors who personify two of the greatest Super-Men villains, remain vile but now are also much funnier.The same is true of two other creatures who step in through a portal into our universe. The shrieks with which the cinema audience greets them say all about how much they have been missed despite the years in the middle. Holland, whose Spider-Man has always been just one of the many Avengers, holds up well when called to be one of a team.The editing is wobbly and rushed in several scenes but is far from capable in denying the fun that everyone has been seeking for.The dialogue is witty and funny, Holland, Zendaya and Batalon are believable as kids who find themselves often out of their depth, the battles are coherently staged, a mirror dimension of the world that Dr Strange builds in one such clash is just wow, Spider-Man is satisfyingly nerdy (\"What's cooler than magic? Math\"), and the past is adroitly linked with the present.Yes, No Way Home is all that you have been hearing and talking about. Yes, it gives you bangs to the power of three for your buck. Yes, it is gratifying to indulge in your favourite Spider-Men films of the recent past once more.And yes, Holland remains as likable and eager as ever.But when the dust settles on this metaverse of multiple villains and many heroes, which Cumberbatch's Dr Strange conjures out of some very furiously moving hands and not seemingly as engaged thoughts, it's unclear what all that was about.", "God": "It had great action and good fight scenes, I always wanted the three Spider-Man and Tom Holland to meet and comment on each other, which in other cases was really satisfying except for a lot of Venom in the movie, but overall it was great.", "The finest superhero movie in years!": "I had very high hopes and expectations before watching the movie and I wasn't let down. This movie's plot has a perfect pace in the beginning and at the end of the movie, great characters, the idea of bringing Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire as previous Spider-men, and also almost all of the previous villains is absolutely breath-taking.The only issue that I was having when I watched the movie is that there were too many things happening all at once, my brain could barely process it haha. However, the fact that the amazing spider-man saved MJ and partly \"avenged\" himself for not being able to save his own Girlfriend, Gwen, is very heart-wrenching. This scene alone deserves the 10 stars.Stan Lee would have been proud of what he had accomplished.Now let's wait for the amazing spider-man 3 and let's hope there is another one of these portals to bring Gwen's Doppelg\u00e4nger from a different universe back to Peter to make him happy again.10/10.", "An epic, crowd-pleasing gem.": "This is easily the best live-action Spider-Man film since Raimi's Spider-Man 2. It has everything that makes this character's stories endearing......clear-cut character motivations, legitimate surprises, a compelling arc of responsibility given to Peter Parker, legitimate consequences to Peter's actions and to the events of the story, comedy that doesn't detract from the tangible stakes, and a strong emotional core to latch on to.This story juggles a LOT of characters, and it doesn't do all of them justice the way it could, but I am beyond impressed with what they did here. It's actually one of the most beautiful Marvel stories I've ever seen put to screen.", "Best Marvel movie ever along with Infinity War": "Awesome movie. Don't miss this experience in theatres. Not spoiling anything but if you are a Marvel comics fan, you're in for a treat.There are many appearances and references from previous Marvel movies and tv shows. So I suggest you do a quick recap before watch this.", "It's ok, has problems": "The acting is decent in this movie, toby and Andrew were the standouts for me. The plot starts off good with the reveal, then it goes downhill, then it's good again. Peter makes some BAD decisions, he is a menace in the whole film. The last half of the film is the best part, but it is hard to overlook how bad Peter is at making decisions of he is supposed to be so smart.", "The return of the Sinister Five": "Peter Parker Identity as Spider-Man has been revealed by Mysterio. Now his life's forever changes as he's hounded by the media, the police and the public. However peter life is not the only one affected as his friends and Aunt May are also persecuted. Peter eventually get the idea to go see Doctor Strange(Benedict Cumberbatch) to have him cast a spell that would make the whole world forget he's spiderman. The spell goes wrong and now Supervillains from other universes invade this one. Now Peter has to make things right and put everything right. This movie while still following the MCU formula manages to still gives something fresh and unique. All the hinting of the multiverse with Doctor strange and Loki now it finally put in to play. The films an overall a nostalgic trip to all Spider-Man fans. To see all these old characters return in a single movie together, I can't be helped but feel warm on the inside. Seeing William Dafoe return as the Goblin and Alfred Molina as Dr octopus truly is fascinating. It feels very much like a into the spider verse live action. While some Villains are given more purposes and reason, really the Lizard and Sandman are kinda pushed to the side. Others like Electro(Jamie Foxx) is given better justice here are relevant to the story and theme of peter as a character. Their not just showing up getting beat and moving on to the next. All of them are in the movie pretty much from the moment their introduce till the finale. Though the two best hands-down are Norman and Otto there's no half ass phone in and they both reprice the roles perfectly capturing those images at the Raimi films are remembered. Peter as a character by the end of this movie has developed more into the Spiderman many know him as. I was never really on board with him as this kid who everybody tony stark just handed everything. Tony given him all his tech, he's having to follow in Tony's footsteps. He didn't have individuality. While peter he makes really stupid decisions really everything that happens is his fault. His actions do have consequences and Doctor Strange really is the voice of reason. M. J & Ned do serve a purposes and while they have their moments, but they weight on the movie in some parts where they should not be involved. Though M. J I was brought around to her more here. She has more personality and opened up now. I didn't care for that whole emo/Goth attitude. I really feel more for her and peters relationship. J. K Simmon as Jameson is great that all I can say he's Jameson and it's nice to have him back in these movies. The actions is great when the action begins it begins and it's amazing. Doc Ock on the Bridge and this amazing fight with Dr strange with such tripping visuals. They have tons of great moments. The movies great with tons of fans service done right that doesn't come off as pandering or lazy. The only things is that unless you seen the other Sony films your feeling towards the films might vary. If your only familiar with this spiderman then many of the older characters won't grab you the same as older fans. It really is a movie for huge Spidey fans with tons of callbacks and references. *Spoilers* The media has done their best to avoid it, but yes both Tobey & Andrew are in the movie. It's amazing they both make all their scenes count. I love the humor between the three of them, the chemistry Especially Tobey and Andrew they really play off each other. They actually serve a purpose ot just thrown in for the fan service, but actually have have their perk to help defeat each villain. I love that Andrew while not my favorite has a very Charismatic charm. He gets closure over Gwen's deaths, the banter about Tobey's Webbing. All of it's great I wanted more them together in the film, but the time they have again they nail it and made it count. Also seeing Matt Murdock Daredevil make a cameo was great and gives hope to him and the other Netflix stars bleeding into the movies or show's . Though some things don't make sense and unsatisfying. Sandman has no reason to turn on peter like at all, he plays in Peter defense the entire time against electro. The second goblin reveals himself and electro bolts he just leaves with them. Tom Hardy Eddie Brock/Venom shows up in the end credits they do nothing with this. They pull him back to his reality he's behind a drop of symbiote, but why want was the point. Teasing audiences like they were getting this venom. So you can do another venom in this universe? You already have a venom that audiences are familiar with it was a bad decisions that gonna leave viewers pissed.", "I rated before I watched it": "Because of the taser is good.

Bad dialog. Bad vfx, bad sfx, kind of tolerable music and cinematography. If this is what we are going for, then the studious will assume we are all babies. Is this how you end a trilogy? Is this how you betray the audience? So many logical problems with the script, constantly trying to force the emotion.

The reason why i was so excited about it was because of how they brought back all the actors who played the heros and villains in the previous spider man movies, and of course that aspect was awesome, but even that was just the icing on the cake. Even without the returning actors this movie would still be fantastic. One of the things i liked about this movie was that unlike the previous MCU spider man movies it actually had a more serious tone to it, not gonna spoil anything but it does have some genuinely powerful moments in terms of emotion and narratine. I also liked it how they had a couple scenes where we saw the 3 spider men interacting with eachother in interesting and funny ways, like that scene where tobey maguire showed them that he can shoow webs out of his hands unlike the other 2 who need web cartridges. Yes some of those scenes did drag on for a bit too long but i really didnt mind because it was still entertaining. There was also a lot of references to the other spider man film series, both serious and comedic ones. Now one of the things i was worried about going in was the movies 2 and a half hour runtime, i was worried the wovie would drag on like avengers endgame did, but thankfully the movie never felt like it was padding itself out and the plot was always moving at a steady pace. Now to be fair this movie isnt perfect, the plot has a couple minor contribences, some of the jokes fell flat on their face, and tobey maguire looked way too old in this one, to the point where he was almost unrecognizable. I mean i get that its been over a decade since his last spider man movie so of course he would have aged a bit since then, but i still think they could have solved that with a bit of makeup like they did with samuel l jackson in captain marvel. Thankfully though the movies strengths well outweighed their flaws so im still giving it a perfect 10. The ending was very strong and conclusive, im just hoping that marvel finally puts the tom holland spider man franchise to rest after this because honestly, there couldnt be a better way to conclude the trilogy than with this.", "What is this masterpiece": "A full-fledged movie, from action to comedy to drama, what a really great movie.Toby is the best spider man for me\nAndrew is the best spider man in terms of drama\nTom is the closest to the comics.I hope to see a new part of Amazing Spider-Man in the near future.", "Goosebumps loaded!!!

The story is great, almost too simple, yet we get sucked into this journey that takes the audience on an unforgettable ride.Tickets are going to be sold out quick for this film but be patient, it will be well worth the wait.A must see!", "This is how you do fan service properly!": "Spider-Man No Way Home might be the most hyped and most anticipated Superhero movie since Avengers Endgame. After that shocking cliffhanger from the previous movie and the fact that villains from both Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy and The Amazing Spider-Man were returning for multiverse madness, the hype went through the roof. However, does it live up to the hype or collapse under its weight?Let's get the obvious praises out the way first. The action sequences are all still very exciting and enjoyable to watch. The fight scenes utilize Spidey's and the villains' ability very well leading to a very fun choreography. Although, my favourite fight happens to just be a brutal fistfight in an apartment that illustrate the new tonal direction of the film. Michael Giacchino returns to score the film and his music score is better than ever. The first half of the film has a similar music score to that of Spider-Man Homecoming and Far From Home. The second half is where Michael's music score starts feeling more sombre and heroic, which is very effective and fitting for the story. He also includes some subtle music soundtrack from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and The Amazing Spider-Man that is very fitting. One complaint that I had about director Jon Watts is that his Spider-Man movies are not visually interesting. This isn't the case in No Way Home with there being good cinematography and memorable shots. There is a scene with Strange and magic that looks visually pleasing and a scene with Peter in the rain that looks stunning.Tom Holland is still phenomenal as Spider-Man with him delivering a great performance. His chemistry with both Jacob Batalon and Zendaya who play Peter's best friend and girlfriend respectively is a wonderful sight. Seeing the three of them work together like the best of friends feels very believable. Benedict Cumberbatch also returns as Doctor Strange and he gives a very different side to him that we haven't seen before. He gives a more playful yet lecturing father-like side to him that bounces well off Spider-Man. Alfred Molina returns after 17 years as Doctor Octopus from Spider-Man 2 and he is still able to embody the character perfectly like he never left. The best performance in this film comes from Willem Dafoe who returns as the Green Goblin From Spider-Man (2002). Willem is somehow able to give a performance that is even more frightening and unhinged than his performance in 2002 Spider-Man. Jamie Foxx also returns as Electro and thankfully his performance is no longer as cringy or silly as it was in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. This time he does feel like a villain to be reckoned with.The story is also a huge step up from the previous MCU Spider-Man movies as it feels like there is more emotional weight this time. One issue with MCU Spider-Man over previous Spider-Man movies is that Peter never has anything personal at stake. This isn't the case in No Way Home where it feels like he is dealing with a lot and even downright suffering for it. He has a proper story arc that is incredibly satisfying. One worry I had was the fact there were 5 villains in this movie. Surprisingly, the movie does a good job of juggling them all. Everyone has a fair amount of dialogue that illustrates their personality while clearly stating their motives for them being against Spider-Man. Even if their motive is just wanting to turn a city into lizards.Unfortunately, Lizard and Sandman don't get as much focus compared to the other three villains. Both do feel like they are just there to have a big CGI battle at the end. I also find Sandman's motive clashes with the other villains which makes it weird for him to be teaming up with them at all. No Way Home also still seems to have a problem that a lot of MCU movies have which is doing quips and jokes without letting the serious nature of the moment linger longer. The film also has some weird editing where it feels like they don't linger on an actor's facial performance for long enough and just cut away to someone else's reaction instead. There are also a fair amount of scenes done with close up camera shots instead of a long or wide shot even though it would be better. Both of these are very noticeable in the final act, most likely due to the studio filming these actors in different places.Overall, Spider-Man No Way Home might be the best MCU Spider-Man film so far. While it is certainly filled to the brim with fan service, the film is still able to maintain a compelling story while making the fan service complement the story. This film should've been a bloated mess and it should have crushed under its weight, but it didn't. While the film certainly has flaws (and some plot holes and plot conveniences), it never damages the experience. No Way Home is an excellent movie that lives up to the hype. This is how you do fan service properly!", "See for yourself how great this was": "No spoilers needed here's a summary go enjoy this wonderful two and half hour experience for yourself it won't disappoint. Every thing from the acting, to the characters re introduced, all the way to the score is just a symphony of art brought together to make a great movie. While of course this is just a single viewers opinion I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a MCU lover as well as a spiderman lover in general. A very great use of my Saturday night absolutely no regrets.", "The best comic movie every": "This is first time Spiderman movie surpass iconic Batman as well as all comics universe movies because it's show how strong Spiderman series are connected with solid story\nA really amazing movie and entertaining \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb super recommended.", "An Amazing Movie for all Spider-Man fans": "This is movie is a pure treat for any Spider-Man fan big or small. Hopefully all of you get to experience with the least amount of the movie spoiled. I would say that the biggest negative of the movie is any spoiler or trailer you see going into the movie. The movie will bring on a ride that will put a smile on your face from ear to ear. Go enjoy is fun time in the theaters.", "No Point": "Obviously I'm part of the minority. I will say it started off ok, but man the ending destroyed any potential. TH isn't that great of an actor to me, but he's trying. The ending was pure trash and made the movie pointless. Side note the \"rules\" of this broken universe are further fractured here. Please explain Venom's ability to be there because it doesn't work within the confines of their established rules from this flick. Won't see any more.", "After Spider-Man into the spider verse what's the point?": "The only thing good about the movie was the come back of Andrew and Tobey, the three of them made a great pair but as usual for most of marvel's production after End Game there was a big hole in the story, the screenplay was awful a total waste of the multiverse so predictable nothing really new the success of the movie is do to nostalgia and of course it's marvel so you always have to watch just in case it's a great one as End game....if you want to watch something substantial about the multiverse just watch Spider-Man into the verse world just perfection from every angle screenplay, sound track just perfect or you could also watch Everything Every all at once which is after watching it and posted a review about it that I remembered that I had to write something about those disappointment of the multiverse and let's not even talk about Dr Strange and the multiverse of really madness cause it was just so crazy bad this movie.", "truly mediocre": "Although there is a huge effort during the first half of the movie to distract with a lot of pretty action. Overall there is no plot until maybe midway. And that plot only occurs because characters have to act a lot more stupid than they typically are. One thing that is really disturbing about this version of spider-man is that the character is virtually the same reckless teenager he was at the beginning. Then in the second half there is a pointless sacrifice as part of an attempt to sort of reboot the series, an effort to restart the character back to his beginnings. Seems they were afraid to continue to develop him as was. All of action makes it sort of fun to watch, like an Olympic event, but otherwise it is a pointless superhero movie meaning nothing.", "What's happening to real reviews?": "The movie is absolutely not a masterpiece. I think these reviews are really overrating it.Plot is really simple, and things happens because writers wanted to, that's it. Goblin and dock oc are only villains well made; Dafoe is amazing. But the rest is pretty empty; it's just fanservice which plays with nostalgia and great of the past. The death of May is really not touching; we don't care about her character, that s why. Compared to death of Uncle Ben in Maguire trilogy or Gwen in the amazing Spiderman, it s almost nothing in terms of emotions. Also, soundtrack seems absent, I don t remember scenes where it's in; exceptions for when old Raimi soundtrack is played. You want to get excited? Go watch Tobey maguire's Spiderman. You just want to watch a Spiderman movie for kids? This is fine.", "A movie that gave us hope that Marvel has more to give us.": "After a worst movie in all of Marvel's history (Eternals). Marvel came back in the best way we can imagine. Marvel has a lot more to give us. Spider Man No Way Home is a movie that was built 20 years ago from the first Spider Man movie with Tobey Maguire. That's why it's one of the best movies in history. That you bring back the most characters influenced by us from old Spider man movies, it's just succeeding as you should expect.", "Pretty cool": "The movie is a real roller coaster of emotions. At one point your heart leaps with excitement but at another you shed tears of heartbreak. Cinematically, it is a masterpiece. It certainly comes as a shock with its happy toned prequels. Don't watch it expecting another movie from the Spiderman Home trilogy. It definitely needs a sequel though. I recommend this movie.", "Homeless": "The best part of this film is the ending. The meaning of no way home is that when the whole world forgets the hero, people will want their loved ones to find their lost memories, and Peter Parker, in order to protect their loved ones, would rather live Live an incognito life, because the hero's road is lonely, he doesn't expect a double life, and loneliness becomes his only companion. The first 2 hours can be greatly reduced, and it will be very bad, smelly and long.", "\"You're not Peter Parker.\"": "Spider-Man has swung into theaters, and has not only saved my faith in the MCU but has elevated it to new heights.I will keep this review brief as to avoid spoilers. Plainly put this was a great film, to say Marvel met expectations with No Way Home is putting it lightly as they blew away my expectations.I am also very happy to say that this was the Phase four Marvel film I've been waiting for, the one that makes Phase four standout from Phases one through three.Definitely a Spider-Man film for the ages so stop reading this, and go watch Spider-Man No Way Home. Also if you can, watch it in whichever premium format you can because this film was amazing in IMAX.10/10.", "Great Marvel Movie": "Clearly one of the best Marvel movies in recent years, coming from Sony this time. There is so much fan service in this one that you cannot retain from having a huge grin throughout the movie. And when Dr Strange is there, it's just a huge plus to any Marvel movie.", "One of the best movies ever": "This movie was simply outstanding. Surely one of the best Marvel movies, and this movie really is in the top leagues. Having all these villains portrayed by the original actors and of course the fact that Toby and Andrew are in the movie just makes it even more better. The story is intricate and written beautifully. I feel like Peter really changed and matured in this movie, with the deaths of main characters like Aunt May, Peter really considers the consequences of being a superhero. Also the ending of the movie was sad, but it also gave a lot of opportunities. For future movies and this movie really made a huge pact in the MCU.", "Do what every Hollywood action sequel do..": "Do the same thing over and over again but more extreme, bigger and longer until the storyline is totally unrealistic and unwatchable.\"That special something\" of the first spiderman movies got lost along the way.", "Best of the Three Spider-Man MCU movies": "I thought this movie had a great balance of drama, action and comedy. It didn't shy away from deeper themes like the other two films and I felt that split it apart from those. As well as that, Peter doesn't rely on a mentor much in this film, (for example Tony) which means most of the development goes to his character. I loved this movie and would say it's worth watching.", "SPIDER-MATIC EXCELLENCE": "Where do I start with this film, it was truly a cinematic experience for the ages. I managed to get DBOX tickets and I truly believe that such films should be experienced in greater premium format.Moving on to the film itself, this has to be the greatest Spider-Man film made till date! Everything was just spot on: the duration, the backstories, and the relevance really made this film worth waiting for.Do not want to give out any spoilers here but the way the MCU has merged itself with the other parallel universes itself is quite impressive. My theatre was roaring when particular entrances were made!If you haven't watch it yet, I'd definitely recommend it watching it in a premium format and with family. Get out there and get your tickets!", "So Bad Nearly Walked Out #YawnFest.": "WOW What a disappointment love superhero films and have watched them since a child so really looked forward to this. Started off quite good though a bit slow but I'm thinking that's fine they are building up to the action and then 2 hours later I'm like where is the action. Honestly this whole film is so pathetic it is 95% of the kids talking wishy washy ohh I love you ohh I love you more all about feelings and emotions ITS PATHETIC.Obvious note that they have something against him wearing a mask now this is so you can connect with him as a person I suppose more weakness just completely utterly SUCKS if I wasn't waiting for my wife watching another film I would have walked out.Utter utter pathetic weak snowflake garbage massive shame as there could have been a great 1hour 30 mins action film here with a superhero doing superhero stuff not going round checking on peoples emotions. The food needs to open a can of Man Up and made a note to never watch another film made by this weak Director. It's a Boo from me.", "WOW WOW WOW!": "Now that's how you do a Spider-Man movie!I have been trying to put my thoughts on the page for days, and still find it difficult because there's SO MUCH TO PROCESS! It's basically a love letter to all the Spider-Man fans who have been there since the beginning. Even before the big reveals of Tobey and Andrew returning to the screen, it felt like a classic Spider-Man film with the villains and overall plot. (It's hard to describe.) I laughed and cried. Cannot wait to see what's ahead for Tom Holland's Spider-Man after that ending!", "Had Fun, but not a Great movie": "I am not a fan of the MCU movies, and many of the issues I have with the overall franchise I still had with this one. But I still had fun and particularly enjoyed seeing characters from the Sam Raimi movies. Did it deserve the high praise from audiences and the box office records? I don't think so.", "A Spider-Man's fan dream come true": "This is hands down my favorite movie to ever come from the MCU and definitely one of the greatest superhero movies ever made. Tom Holland really gives it his all as Peter Parker/Spider-Man for the end of the HOME Trilogy, learning what he truly means to be Spider-Man. Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange as the mentor in this movie was the perfect choice and probably my favorite out of all the mentors in the HOME trilogy. His character brings us some of the best elements in this movie, bringing us to new heights we haven't yet seen in the MCU until now. The relationship with Peter and MJ made me feel and care for these two characters more than I have ever cared about for two characters in the MCU before. I really felt and cared for these two characters and the fact that their together in real life to makes me feel even more for the two. Ned was definitely the comic relief character and showed us a side of his character we haven't seen until now either. Happy and Aunt May were great supporting characters too, with Aunt May bringing us some of the best lines of the entire film. Now it's time to start with the Villains, starting with Willems Dafoe's Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. He is absolutely terrifying in this outing as the Green Goblin bringing us a new terrifying side we never saw in Sam Rami's Spider-Man trilogy. His performance in this movie makes him one of my favorite villains not only just in the MCU, but in any movie of all time. Alfred Molina as Doctor Otto Octavius was one of my favorite characters of the whole movie, also bringing us a side of his character we haven't seen before and one of the most interesting characters of the entire film. Jamie Foxx's Max Dillion Electro, Thomas Haden Church's Flint Marco/Sandman and Rhys Ifans Doctor Connors/Lizard were great additions as the other villains. Some of the choices for their characters I felt wasn't used the best as I hoped they wouldn't of been, but with so much other things going on in this movie, it's hard to keep up with everything else with the characters too. The two characters I was glad to see the most though was both Andrew Garfield's and Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker/Spider-Man's. Andrew Garfield definitely stole the show in every single scene he is in and Tobey Maguire brought us a side of his Spider-Man that was new and thrilling. What I was glad the most though with both of these characters was, I felt the MCU finally brought us as fans justice and what we've always wanted for both of these characters for years and I think the MCU executed that perfectly. Another character I was glad to see was Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock/Daredevil. I'm a huge fan of the Netflix series and now that he is officially playing the character of in the MCU is a dream come true. Overall, as I said before, this is hands down as of today my favorite MCU film and it's unlike any of the other MCU films we have gotten over the years. It gave me everything I wanted and so much more. If I had anything about this movie to complain about, it's I wished we've gotten more development in the other villains in this movie and we got to see more of Venom than in the mid credit scene we got, but I can see why they only had him in that scene. This is definitely the best and truest Spider-Man film I have ever scene and it left me wanting more. I can't wait to see Spider-Man again in the future, because I know when we do, it'll be a version of Tom Holland's Peter Parker we haven't seen before and will give us hope for the MCU moving forward. I also hope we get to see more of the characters in this film. Rating 10/10.", "Spidey marvels again in ticket sales": "Spider-Man: No Way Home: 5 out of 5 stars\nThe ticket sales on Spider-Man: No Way Home indicate that audiences have connected with this flick as it reached 1.3 billion dollars and counting so it appears this flick will fly straight to the Oscars.Marvel Studios saw a spider-sense in this movie. This movie is dedicated to Spider-Man creators Stan Lee, Avi Arad and Steve Ditko who created the character. This episode of Spider-Man follows Peter Parker on a quest with his webslinger powers to be with Doctor Strange, Otto Octavius, Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, his best friend Ned, Mary Jane Watson and two previous Peter Parkers(Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield) to strengthen the Multi-Verse. The theater that I was in was jammed packed with people glancing at the screen laughing and they understood and caught the narrative of No Way Home. It has incredible action sequences, it's fun for the whole family and two post credit scenes that will have audiences clicking for Venom and Doctor Strange. But the important thing to learn about Spider-Man, is with great power comes great responsibility. As in the movie some friends and villains die. \"No Way Home\" is a blockbuster that will have young and old and some newbies to the web-slinger hungry for more.", "A bridge too far": "This had some great sequences, unfortunately, for me, that's what it felt like, a movie with some great sequences.I found that I just couldn't buy into this latest Spider-Man adventure - nor could I really care all that much. It felt convoluted and long and a bit of a mess that seemed to lack cohesion - and to be fair - that's despite the efforts of the actors, who produced some good material.", "One of the strongest MCU movies for me": "Spider-Man asks Dr Strange for help in a difficult situation.'No Way Home' makes impressive use of the multiverse concept to connect several movie franchises and achieves it with strong character moments.Tom Holland gives an epic lead performance of range and charisma. He is one of the main reasons I enjoyed it. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon give great support. Plus there are a number of brilliant cameos worked perfectly into the plot. Marisa Tomei and John Favreau are also great in the usual roles.Like the previous MCU Spider-Man films, the comedy is excellent, with lots of funny situations, humorous banter and site gags.I enjoyed some of themes explored by the writers around immigration and the divisive role of the media. JK Simmons' reimagined character from the Sam Raimi trilogy is worked nicely into these ideas. Importantly there was quite a refreshingly positive tone with the non-lethal intentions of the heroes towards the villains and this for me is what sets it apart from so many other action-adventure movies.As ever with Marvel, the visuals and spectacle is technically fantastic and dominates certain sequences. There is a bit too much for my liking, but not to the point where it spoils anything.", "Nostalgic Masterpiece": "By far the greatest Spider-Man film and by far the greatest marvel film ever made! This really isn't your typical overhyped superhero film.I enjoyed absolutely every minute of it and was amazed at the writing of the storyline linking both past and present.I really don't think they could of done it any better and the nostalgic feeling from The Green Goblin & Dr Octo back with the original actors is something I've never felt watching a film before.Thankyou so much to everyone involved in making this. 10/10.", "Fatally - literally fatally - flawed.": "There was some fun to be had, some big, if not entirely coherent, battle scenes, and a lot of web-slinging. All was OK on that score.Dramatically, it was a mess. We know that Peter is an irresponsible teenager. We've seen him develop in the other films. By now, after local, European and Galactic struggles involving the loss of comrades, one of whom was his mentor and father figure, he should have learned a thing or two. Unfortunately, we're led to believe that he hasn't. Instead, the writers have decided to turn back the clock on his character to the point where he's a more of an insufferable adolescent nitwit here than he was in any of the previous films.Maybe the film wanted to say something about responsibility and owning your mistakes, but I don't think so. It just needed to fake an emotional core, hoping to equal the much tighter and infinitely more truthful Spiderman 2, so they proceeded to kill off someone close to the hero. They didn't do it to emphasise a character flaw, or put Peter in his place for getting too big for his boots. It was a consquence of behaviour that the doomed character would certainly have trained Peter out of by the time he was five! It was a gimmick.I'm going to read Spider-man annual 2 again, the one I got from the comic rack in the corner shop in 1965, the first Spidey/Doc Strange collaboration, and maybe get rid of the bitter taste No Way Home left in my mouth.", "Never, NEVER, have I ever seen a better movie": "This was the best movie I have ever seem, it's better then all marvel- no, ALL SUPERHERO MOVIES combined! The action, that fact that the old villains came back! Everything was amazing. Absolutely amazing!", "This movie is beyond belief": "This movie did things that fans couldn't have expected is it weren't for the leaks and set images. But all that aside this is the best marvel movie to-date.", "Simply Mind Blowing": "No doubt one of the best MCU movies. If Spiderman is you favorite hero, then this movie will most likely top all of them. It's an very ambitious plot not seen in any super hero movie that if not done right could have fallen flat on it's face. But the MCU didn't just do it right, they knocked it out of the park. The acting by all is superb with one actor (dare I say) rivaling the great Heath Ledger's joker. What is so amazing about this film is the story fits right with previous Avenger movies, but some how nails who Spiderman really is to all of us. The film is fun and emotional with a hint at a second chance for the characters in many different ways. I don't purchase many movies on DVD, but this will be one of them.", "Great elements, but a bit messy": "So, this movie was really exciting! There were some bits that were truly exhilarating, and breathtaking. A lot of surprising moments and a heck of a lot of fan service in the sense that I am certain some of those shots were like panels take right out of the comics. Very cool.The story was a bit unexpected in some way and that was a nice surprise. The performances for some of the characters was absolutely fantastic.Unfortunately, the general theme and feeling of the movie was not to my liking. It felt quite convoluted and as an overall feeling, I don't appreciate how it sort of 'went' ... but I am still glad I watched it. In fact, some of the elements are so cool, I am thinking I may go for a second viewing.There is at least one moment in this movie where I heard the entire room audibly gasp and that is incredibly rare for my local cinema.", "Why you should watch": "This spider man film personally topped the trilogy of Tom Hollands spider man saga, it had so many pinnacle points which made feel more meaningful. The acting work of Zendaya, Jacob and Tom was to perfection, along with Jon faveru who although wasn't seen that much, made the film feel like it belonged to him whenever he was on screen. The film is well balanced with comedy, sadness and joy which combined and mixed in the right way give the film a sense of perfection. The film always kept me guessing as to what would happen next, it also brought back memories of my childhood with the appearance of Toby maguire and Andrew Garfield, who portray Peter Parker from their time lines. When the three spider men are all together it brought a tear to my eye and made my inner child jump with joy.

It definitely met my expectations and I definitely weren't disappointed.

Honestly I've never had so much fun and I've never heard an audience this loud ever, BUT that doesn't doesn't mean the movie doesn't have any flaws because it does. For example Lizard and Sandman were big disappointments, CGI was a bit messy in places, pacing was a bit weird sometimes especially in the first act of the movie, there was also a few plot holes but I think they can be explained.

I can accept debate between this one and Into the Spider-verse, but for sure no competition as best live action spidey movie. Not to mention, the spidey movie with most powerful emotions and lessons, not just for a spiderman movie, but a superhero movie as well.Tom Holland proves that he is a great spider-man. Tobey was a great Peter Parker and Andrew was a great Spider-man, but Tom is the best of both. This is also NOT a Iron Man Jr. Movie, is a Spider-man movie.The Villains. All of them shine and each have their own moments, but the one that tops and steals the show is off-course William Dafoe, and wow he is even scarier without that goblin mask.There are issues with the movie, but no movie is perfect. Most issues are nit-picks. Some audiences might not like the movie because they will see this as a movie that depends heavily on nostalgia. This is true, yet this movie is a love letter to Spider-man fans and putting that aside it is still a great movie.Watching this movie in theaters proves that super hero and comic book movies are MOVIES. This movie proves that blockbusters are the one keeping the theaters and the film industry alive. This franchise is now something we can compare with big ones like Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc. Something that you won't experience the same at home versus the movie theaters with other people. These movies are meant to be seen at a theater.", "Loved the scenes hated the premise": "A lot of reaches and coincidences involved to make the plot.

Andrew, God you are amazing, And Toby, man. It was such an honor to see you again in the suit. I never thought I would ever a movie better than Endgame, but Sony! You took the cake with this one!

It's a piece of art that can in my opinion NOT BE TOPPED!", "you need rose tinted spectacles": "This film is unwatchable.The director for some reason decided the first take was good enough- maybe there was only one take for each scene- and hence the acting is wooden and not at all believable.Then there is the CGI, Harry Harryhausen- in fact Wallace and Gromet- have better dynamic implementations. CGI from the 70's was better than this.Never mind the stupid wig/hat Dr Strange was kitted out with.I dont know if the plot is any good as I could not bare to watch any more after he ripped the door of the car in the traffic jam.You have to be very forgiving to watch this film.", "What a movie my friends": "Spider Man No Way Home is everything literally the end of everything for Peter, being serious here, this movie made Far From Home and Homecoming even better, it made all the Spider-Man movies better, the fight scene with Doc Ock made me see what Michael Giacchino was doing with the triology theme, Homecoming had and generic theme, the weakest, Far From Home was more strong, firm, and this movie made the strongest, talking about the villans, they made Electro better, and Lizard too, I was confused about Sandman motivations, but he was good in the film too, the building fight with Aunt May death broke me, for real, they did the scene so perfectly, the choreography, the CGI, the dialogues, everything was where should be, the ending fight with Tobey and Andrew, and talking about them, what a good apearence, it was perfectly in the right place, Andrew talking about Gwen made me cry, Tobey completing the line of Tom, the final fight, and what a final fight tho, it was so good, William Defoe did a really good job here, his acting was perfect, and at the end, Peter being literally erased from existense, this movie made everything of the other two movies look like a dream, the final suit was definetly the best. This movie made this triology even better, what a movie my friends, what a movie.", "One of the best superhero movie i've seen": "Here is my opinion on the movie. Not ok with it? Do a review yourself :-)I've seen every MCU and DC movies in theaters and i was surprise by the film. One of the 3 superheroes movies of all time on my board.We see a lot of caracters evolve and the movie takes time to set each one in the story.Full of action scenes of different types from one another. Escape the crowd, escape the magician, run from vilains, fight the vilains, save the world.The visual effects are great. The combat scenes takes the best of all spiderman movies and benefits from it. Camera angles and movements are excellent.", "It\u00b4s an okay movie, with some problems": "First of all, I don\u00b4t think that this movie is bad but that it is pretty overrated, it really is.Maybe the main problem on it is the writing with some serious plot holes. C\u00b4mon, doctor strange is defeated by spider-man with GEOMETRY.The majoraty of this movie is pretty boring too. Only being saved by it\u00b4s third act or more specifically the entrace of the other spider-man. From that moment on the movie is almost a 10/10 for me.Another thing that pisses me off is the cgi. Sometimes its good, like when spider-man and doctor strange are fighting in the mirror dimension and sometimes it\u00b4s pretty bad, like when it happens the entrace of andrew garfield\u00b4s spider-man or when the spider-man of andrew garfield lands in the final battle.Verdict:\nThis is an okay movie with some problems but it still is watchable. If you are a fan of the old movies maybe you should give it a try.Final score: 5.5/10.", "Disappointed": "Just like almost everyone here I was also hyped to see Tobey back as Spider-man again and boy was I disappointed. Tobey wasn't given a single moment that used to define him as THE Spider-man. I know this was Tom Holland's movie for the most part but even Andrew got a chance to redeem himself by catching MJ from falling to her death. Where was Tobey's moment? Apart from a few dialogues, one of them being about his back hurting that only cater to the memes that have been going around for a good few years now. I feel like Tobey's Spidey was not used to even half it's potential. It seemed forced. Felt like Tobey didn't wanna do it anymore and that sucks for someone like me who has grown up watching Tobey's movies over and over again.All the villains in the movie seemed redundant as well. They lacked purpose. I feel like they were only added in the movie for the sake of marketing and ending the trilogy with a bang (which I think worked for the type of audience they were targetting)They lacked so much in purpose that they didn't even put up a good fight (and to be honest, neither did Andrew and Tom, who were just running away from the villains for the most part). There was no dialogue between Tobey and William Dafoe, WHICH SUCKS FOR ME AS A FAN.I feel like a lot of it was forced to be honest.Overall, I'd give this movie a 5/10 for finally allowing me to see Tobey and Andrew back as their respective Peter Parkers but that's all there is to it.", "Good always has its consequences": "So many expectations, so many hopes and leaked photos. For any fan, a new Spider-Man movie is always the biggest release of the year. So far, Holland's films haven't disappointed, but they haven't jumped up to the bar set by Sam Raimi either. Did Watts succeed in creating something more, or is there really nothing in the film besides references?", "multverse consept": "To say that there has been an unbelievably long wait for the Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer is actually something of a grand understatement; just looking at the two other 2021 Marvel Cinematic Universe films that never had any marketing materials released before their covid-19 delays, we see a far different story in terms of publicity: the teaser trailers for both Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (September) and Eternals (November) dropped some five or six months before their respective release dates, while the full trailers arrived roughly three months out. The very first preview for the third Spidey didn't arrive until tonight, just under four months until the movie's December 17 debut, and, even then, the argument could be made that it only materialized because of a leaked - and work-in-progress - version from yesterday had forced both Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios's hand.While the exact nature behind this unprecedented MCU delay remains currently unknown, what is known is just how much news, rumors, and sheer speculation from seemingly all corners attempted to fill the content void over the course of the past year. And, intriguingly enough, the teaser's long-awaited arrival hasn't done much to address those ardently held theories - though it certainly has given us some bones of substance to chew on until the next, full trailer gets delivered from on high.It's a lot to parse, so we're going to do our best to wade through it all together. Here's everything we know about the big-picture, overarching connections of No Way Home now that we've received the very first narrative confirmations (and half-confirmations, as it were).", "Best movie": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is the most interesting part.The best end of the year, it was this film .. It just turned out to be \"a trump card in the sleeve of Marvel\". After watching this film, very interesting impressions remain.A chic idea with a multiverse, perfectly beaten. All fans of the universe I think will be delighted.While watching this film, you can experience a whole bunch of emotions, which is an important part of a good picture, the film does not become dry.Be sure to go to this movie if you want to see a really high-quality picture.", "Mind blowing": "Actually it's a fan service movie but other than its a perfect ending to the trilogy. The best Spiderman movie tobey and Andrew to respire their roles once again. Legends camed back.williem Alfred Foxx. And Tom's acting was Oscar worthy. This is movie in watts triliogy that we can see Peter struggle. Its funny dark action goosebumps entertainment all in one movie.", "Overhyped to the moon": "As is customary for all MCU movies, this one is also massively overhyped and overrated. I enjoyed the first Spidey movie (Homecoming) featuring Tom Holland as it was funny, the characters were all likeable and it had a decent story with some twists and unpredictable moments.This one however, starts off with a stupid but neat idea, the execution, however, is dismal. They just manage to rehash every other Spiderman movie before this and it was stupid, predictable and boring. I felt no chemistry between MJ and Peter this time around and I know they are a couple in real life but in the movie it just didn't work. All the other characters felt bland except for maybe a villain or two.Overall, I just got bored watching this and am glad I didn't pay to see it in theatres. I thought others would be cured of their MCU disease by now but looking at other reviews it is definitely not the case. Carry on milking this, Disney, seems like there's a lot money to be squeezed out. I am done with this though, enough of this repetitive CGI Superhero/Comics crap.", "No Way (Back to) Home(coming)": "I must be honest, I rate this a 5/10. I am bewildered by the 9.0 rating here and the general positivity being thrown at it. I think it's weaker than the second film.I do not think the dialogue is good, especially between the three spidermen. I don't think the villains are given proper screentime (and how could they with how many there are), not to mention they bring back 3 terrible villains I didn't ever want to see again. Sandman, Reptile man, Electro. And they are just as weak and irrelevant as when we first saw them in their original films. Some of them also switch back and forth from helping Peter as the plot requires it, which was weird. The only two good villains here, Doc Oc and Goblin are both noticeably aged, but apparently the writers thought the best time to have them come back is right before their deaths in their original films, even though they are like 20 years older ... Couldn't have, well, I don't know, brought them from a different universe where they had killed their spiderman and aged until they were defeated by somebody else? The same \"moral dilemma\" could play out. I guess that would make too much sense though ... So can't do that! Also annoys me they wasted so much time on the worst villains, meanwhile the only two who could have had the chance to shine were given very little material to utilize.Peter's sidekick friend is now a sorcerer? HUH? But it's okay because we make him fail and try over and over therefore he's not a Gary Sue.The heart to heart between the Peter's felt forced and unusual. The entire setup really just seemed like a thinly veiled plot to have multiple villains fight multiple good guys, which has basically been the latest trend in the marvel films, but this time with an extra extra gimmick (three spidermen). The pacing is generally not good.The ending is decent enough though. Whether or not Marvel will stick to it (they won't) remains to be seen, but it's at least a ballsy ending. I did also like Garfield's catch of MJ. That was a really good moment. MJ was also decent enough throughout, she was really the tether of the film. Aunt May's death was necessary and the best part of the film. But is also kind of ruined by the extraordinary amount of comedy in this movie. Combine the first and second film, as well as Thor 3's comedy and that's what you get to here. It's a stilted unfunny, awkward mess that contrasts this \"comedy\" with really dark themes. Why couldn't it just be a dark themed film with a few jokes? Why can't we just go back to that?I miss the more self-contained and aware narrative of Homecoming. While not perfect, it had a charm and wasn't too over the top. This entire movie just screamed of FANSERVICE and \"come on it'll be cool the kids will LOVE IT!\" Why must we always scale up every subsequent film? Why can't we just write a strong script, no matter if the scale isn't massive and bombastic? Minimalist storytelling, even for superheroes, can be great. Look at Logan. Look at The Wolverine. Look at Homecoming. We don't have to always save the universe or have massive battles. Sometimes all you need is one well written hero and an even better written villain. I'd rather have that than 5 thin villains and three thin heroes.Maybe I'm just too old for this now. I am starting to agree with Scorsese more and more. Marvel isn't cinema. It's an experience. It's a themepark in film form.", "Does it even have a plot?": "I didn't understand anything, except I knew that guy was Dr strange before anyone said his name.The movie didn't have enough characters, it probably needed 150 more for a 2 star rating.", "Fan Service": "I didn't expect much from the beginning but after all the hype I genuinely hoped that it is going to worth my time. It's awful with all the lazy writing, mediocre fight scenes and incoherent plot. How did this movie even get this rating 8.8?", "Lived up to the hype": "I was very worried going in to this film after all the hype that had been surrounding it for months. But man did it deliver! Great acting, great action, and tremendous reveals that had the whole theatre yelling! Great film... well done Marvel.", "Setup for future Spiderman movies...": "Ok even though alot if the rating are based of how big the movie was and how some old characters returned to this era butBut you can't deny that the plot was genius. It sets up future Spiderman movies so well now thatpetere doesn't have any money , any family or even anyone that knows him\nExactly like the spiderman in the comics now he is just a kid who has no money and has to rely more on his powers instead of stark tech and has to climb up himself.", "Best Spider-Man Movie Ever!": "This is the best and emotional final Spider-Man Movie ever! Wow! I love all those scenes! It just absolutely incredible! I love the acting of five villains in that film. I felt emotional the way when the Green Goblin killed Aunt May and Peter comforts her which makes me felt very sorry for him.", "NOSTALGIC": "I loved every second of the movie, im a huge spidey fan since my childhood and as a fan it was so satisfying and nostalgic from start to end, action packed and emotional.

This is a must watch, if you like super hero movies!", "best movie!": "And without a doubt Tom Holland's best spider movie and perhaps one of the best web-slingers ever made. Very good script, which manages to put all the pieces together in a very interesting way, very good visual effects, comedy that works, and finally, Tom Holland's spider gets a dramatic arc that it really is. Excellent, just grab the popcorn and have fun.", "I had a good time": "Isn't that what you want from a spider-man movie? Ok, it has its length, especially through the end, but, all this set apart, I've had a good and entertaining time watching it. Not really paying attention to detail or camera angles, because that's not that movie. It's a entertaining movie and not a controversial character study about growing up in \"New York\" or getting admitted to college.Just enjoy the show, especially the \"good actors\" appearance ;)", "Puts the \"Amazing\" in \"The Amazing Spiderman\"": "Absolutely wonderful movie. I didn't expect it to be this enjoyable. The story is incredible clever, hilarious, poignant, and very emotional without becoming sappy. It hits all the right notes in the best way. They managed to weave together our favorite heroes and villains in one beautifully layered movie without becoming scattered or obtuse.I'm still fresh off of viewing it for the first time and I'm certain to watch it again. It is probably one of the most emotionally-charged Spiderman movies to date, and the interactions of previous incarnations of the webslinger (as more than mere cameos) was incredibly well done.I'm fairly jaded when it comes to movies these days but this one they really hit out of the park. Definitely a 10/10.", "Read if you didn't watched it...some spoilers": "I believe they did a good job making this movie by getting the other Peters together. There were few scenes where the conversations and dialogues are longer than it should be. I also think they did lousy job of ending the legal trials and public exposure of Peter Parker being spiderman. At the beginning of the movie you see it to be the most important topic. You wait to see the whole movie is about it but it ends by a superhero blind lawyer who just had a 1-min scene at the middle of the movie.I loved it and i think it is worth watching.", "By far, the worst Spider-man movie": "Plot is a bit rubbish and popularity of former movies have been used to get some pulse. Imagination is OK, but should have been supported by coherence. It was not satisfying for me except for the visual effects.", "If It Wasn't For The Terrible Script.....": "The movie scenes were very well made, but so many times the wording interaction between some of the actors was subpar, especially between the various Peter Parkers. Sometimes the exchanges between Dr. Strange and Spider-Man were off put and just did not blend well. But the story line, the acting and the effects were outstanding.", "I love this": "Most amazing movie i have ever watched.film directory is awesome Nostalgic scenes are very reminiscent of childhood No matter how many times I see it, it doesn't seem old. Every time I see it, tears come to my eyes.", "Fanservice done right": "Everyone is here. The movie has a few funny scenes and convincing special effects (as expected). My favorite scene of the movie is when Tobey Maguire solaces Andew Garfield who feels that he is the Peter Parker from the most boring universe (which is what most people tend to agree with). In some scenes there was too much fanservice which makes these scenes feel unnatural, which is why 8/10 is the correct rating for this movie in my opinion. Finally, I did not enjoy the mid credits scene, it feels forced and should not have been part of the movie.", "I could not believe how dumb this movie was.": "So I finally saw this movie. I haven't been real interested in the MCU since Endgame concluded but this had great reviews and it's Spiderman so I figured i'd give it a shot.What the hell? This movie is the dumbest movie in the MCU. It has a plot that is so unbelievably stupid and hamfisted that I can't believe I haven't heard anyone call it out yet.It seriously feels like every single character in this series got transformed into a complete idiot with the end goal being that MCU wanted to figure out a way to force the Multiverse into the story line because that's apparently where we're going to go after Endgame wrapped up. Doctor Strange particularly draws my ire. Really Victor, you're going to create a complicated world altering spell with massive cross universe complications potentially so that Peter's friends can get good college recommendations? Are you serious? This plot seems like it was ripped out of Rick and Morty, I'm just waiting for Rick to show up with a \"I just wanted you to see how dumb and stupid the idea of going to a \"prestigious college\" was.\" It literally seems like a comedic gag and yet this is the plot that is supposed to set up the rest of the direction of the MCU? The absurdity of this convoluted plot is interspaced with fan service throwbacks to old Sony characters (who also act like complete idiots in this movie) and even I'll admit that I'll never grow tired of Willem Dafoe's Norman Osborne but they serve as little more than distractions to get you to not think about how stupid everything else is in the movie around them.The action scenes are all standard Marvel fare. The stakes being so totally ridiculous and unbelievable completely drew me out of them if I'm being totally honest. I honestly just wanted to fast forward through them so I can see what the next unbelievable turn of this windy circus show was going to be. I think this is the one area where \"franchise fatigue\" might actually be a thing because I just couldn't be bothered to get excited about yet another CGI fest intersperced with little witty one liners as is the MCU formula these days. Without actual stakes, this all just felt like it could have been copy paste out of Thor Ragnarok and nothing really would have changed.I went into this movie with pretty moderate expectations. I'm already divested from the MCU as it is, but I figured I'd give this movie a shot since it's the one that is pretty universally agreed to be a fun time and I cannot believe how disappointed I am with it. This was a VERY dumb action movie even by comic book movie standards, that feels insulting to the characters, and is a giant red flag that whatever Marvel is trying to do with the MCU without RDJ, Chris Evans and the rest in severe disarray.", "I wanted to love this...": "I wanted to love this movie but it just dragged on and on. Sure, it had some great effects and surprises but they just insisted on showing too much. Twenty to Thirty minutes of this film should have been moved to the delete bucket... but the editors just had to leave it here so we could see all the scenes they created.", "Just love you guys": "I dont get people who are amazed with this movie and give it a 8 or 9...its a movie for 10....wonderful story, it was really enjoyble and passed(at least for me) as it was only 20minutes...thanks marvel for this movie that brings childhood back. \u2665", "Awesome!": "I love it!!!!Perfect movie to watch in December.Happy, Fun, and Got a Surprise!!I would to watch this movie again on Theater.Wih you all the best everyone'", "You can spend good time if you don't have brain!": "Yep, it's true. If you want to spend good time when you watch this movie, you need to be vegetable or should do judgment and thinking skills offline. \"Sorry, your review is too short. It needs to contain at least 150 characters.\"", "My professional view": "This part of Spider-Man is especially important from the whole story of this movie. In addition to the new characters we see on our screens such characters as Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe and others that we haven't seen since the first parts of Spider-Man. More than ever this part of Spider-Man: No Way Home ties into the entire history of Spider-Man. I recommend everyone to revisit all the movies before this part to re-live the storyline. I advise to read the review of the film not just one, but from several film experts. Because this series turned out to be controversial for many experts. But personally for me it is a masterpiece that should be nominated for at least 2-3 Oscar nominations.", "Hands down, best Spider-Man ever": "This was a fantastic film, best non avenger marvel movie to date. The attention to detail as well as all the great dialogue completely makes up for that terrible last one with the dumpy non Wizard mysterio.", "Great for nostalgia, but not for standalone movie.": "You-YOU- YOU! It's all good actors who played the Spider man. Toby was a classic Spider man, nothing too flashy there. Andrew was modern and nerdy Spider man. This new one was Gen Z teen Spider man, because why not.This new iteration filled the gap which didn't exist on the older Spidy, having the drama and pain elements well defined. Like a good bigger brothers Spider mans teach the young one what he is fighting for. It's was nostalgia movie, in case nobody have seen the original villains or for the people who miss the old actors. Nothing new to add, only confirming the multi-verse theory. I didn't enjoy how long this movie was and how plain and simple the villains were, they had strong background, their own drama to tell. I really liked the Sand man, he really loved his daughter, but only once he mentioned it. By the way, how do you cure mental illness with a serum? I don't think the Goblin can be cured just like that. Anyhow I think this was okay movie with some lesson learned and building stronger personality. You could have done it better and shorter.", "Surprising": "This movie manages to be exciting and better than the previous two.The story is convincing and entertaining, the justifications are believable, there are emotional moments, there are many pleasant surprises, and the whole plot is shocking. I think that in the story part there are no negative aspects, but in terms of the visual, it is a setback for the trilogy, since the action scenes are not like to the ones in the previous film, the special effects need to improve, the direction is not very committed since some scenes seem to be done very quickly and without much effort, there is no planning of where each character was going to be in the scenes or where the camera could widely capture what was happening. The ending seems confusing to me, but maybe it will be resolved in some other Marvel movie.Without a doubt, it is a film full of very effective surprises and that improves in terms of story and script compared to the other two, it is definitely worth it.", "Nice": "What a movie\nThe best movie I saw better than any superhero movie all time\nIn my opinion, it is the best movie ever better than any Spider-Man's movies else.", "What a wasted opportunity...": "This could have been a fantastic movie, must be the first time someone did a multiverse film with this idea of bringing back old actors. However, it was a complete flop. The scene where Tobey and Andrew are introduced could have been memorable, but for some mysterious reason they screwed it up into a stupid teen parody.Seeing it messed up so badly brought back the same sorrow as the latest \"Star Wars movies\" and GOT seasons 7 and 8. We'll just forget it.", "Spiderman": "Don't miss it, I repeat don't miss if u don't want to regret...Hence proved Marvel is not just a franchise, Marvel is festival, Marvel is emotion, Marvel is happiness....", "Fan service in the best way": "This is the perfect conclusion to the Homecoming trilogy. It finally shows Peter Parker becoming Spider MAN not Spider Boy or Spider Teen.It was really amazing seeing all of the villains from the previous Spider Man instalments together - and despite them having small roles, not only do they have things to do, but they also have a lot more depth in the old movies.Tom Holland in this movie is 100% the best he's ever been in all of his appearances in the MCU - his acting is superlative and really moving.Doc Ock is definitely my favourite \"villain\" in this. Even in Spider Man 2, he was far more developed than the other characters.Doctor Strange is awesome as always and I cannot wait to see him in The Multiverse of Madness.Oh and a certain cup that says \"We are happy to serve you.\" will always make me tear up now. In a way it summons the whole movie: fan service with love and winks.I'll definitely be seeing this again in the cinemas.", "Must watch": "This was an emotional roller coaster full of action and surprises.

The movie itself is intense at some parts, yet draggy at others, full of nostalgic fan service, not all the jokes land well, many of them are pretty cheesy (well, it's still MCU after all lol), but over all you most likely gonna love this, not just for spidey or general comicbook fans, but also for general viewers and movie-goers. So yeah, go watch it. Don't forget the health protocol tho!8.5/10.", "The Definitive Spider-Man Movie": "The moment each villain popped up, the crowd exploded. The moment May died, the crowd exploded. The moment Andrew came on screen, the crowd exploded. The moment Tobey came on screen the crowd exploded. The banter between Tobey and Andrew is hilarious and their conversation with Tom is heartfelt. This truly changed Tom's Peter from being Iron Man Jr. To being Spider-Man. Mid-Credit scene they show Eddie Brock leave behind a drop of symbiote. Post credit scene we got to see the trailer for Multiverse of Madness.", "I only watched for Tobey": "So you would think that after the Spider man 3 flop with Tobey Maguire they would have learned NOT to cram so many villans into one movie... Nope. The movie was clustered AF. MY Favorite part in the movie was when Jamie fox says \"there's got to be one black spiderman out there.\" And that's the sad part.I watched this movie on a flight and most of it was boring. I was waiting the entire time for Tobey and when he came it was like he was so tired of being spider man that he didn't really want do the movie, he was just there.If they were bringing back villans they should have brought Harry back.Although this movie had tons of nostalgia and Tobey will always be my Spider man, I felt like this movie was highly over rated.", "One of the best spiderman movies": "Movie was really good. Finally they give a proper story for Tom's spidy. Story was solid, no big deal. But i personally didn't like the way they introduce Toby and Andrew. CGI was bad sometimes.And they have used too much jokes, every single situation is filled with jokes. Its bother me to feel the movie sometimes. However movie is enjoyable cause these spider men's chemistry. So I give it 8/10.", "Really good Spiderman movie": "Weather you like Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield as spider man better than Tom Holland as Spider-Man no one can deny that this movie pandered to all the fanboys and was just a super fun movie to watch. I don't think anyone expected this movie to be spectacular but it for sure delivered on the hype being one of the most anticipated Spider-Man movies I can think of. Having all the old actors come back and act in this movie us super cool to see and I was again amazed by Willem Dafoe's acting. Not only did he perform all his own stunts in the movie but he also gave one of the horrifying performances as Green Goblin, doing that role more justice than I think anyone else ever could. Everyone that came back for this movie also did an amazing job and marvel did them all the characters and actors justice with their roles in this movie.", "Greatest super-hero move of all time": "It's so much for me to see that mcu understanding what audience wants around the world and they deliver the largest and the most wonderful movie for spiderman.", "Spider-Man's greatest hits!": "SPIDER-MAN:NO WAY HOME (2021) pulled off a neat trick. It's a modern film that I heard nothing but great things about and unbridled praise where I almost fully agree with the raves. The only other major film in recent years that's been praised where I agree with the popular opinion is Joker from 2019, but then it's almost impossible to deny that film's brilliance based on Joaquin Phoenix's all-time performance. The fact that I even like No Way Home is a feat because I find most modern comic book superhero movies to be interchangeably cringe with too much comedy, CGI, and unrelatable characters. A huge reason that No Way Home breaks the mold is because it does something that feels unique. Yes, there has been multi-verse content before, but not on this level, in my opinion. I mean, the CW's Arrowverse does it's annual multi-verse gathering of superheroes, but that network is the definition of cringe content. Then there's the DCEU and MCU team ups, but that's just like the CW stuff but with higher quality and (slightly) better acting. Well, maybe not better acting in the DCEU! LolNo Way Home feels different. It merges the universes of the 3 modern 21st century Spider-Men/Peter Parkers played by Tobey Maguire (the first), Andrew Garfield (the middle), and Tom Holland (the current and the one that this film is centered around). Going in, I knew that Maguire and Garfield would be in this movie, but not to the extent they were. Like, they had a TON of screen time! And the interactions among this trio were gold. Seeing these 3 acting styles collide was surprisingly effective. I haven't seen Maguire in anything in years and was surprised by how well he slipped back into the part. I've never been the biggest Holland fan, but he really brought it emotionally in this movie. And Garfield is simply Garfield, one of the best up and coming young actors in Hollywood. I mean, this actor has been nominated for a couple of Oscars and SHOULD have been nominated for The Social Network. And his acting in The Amazing Spider-Man was another level from what is normally done in superhero movies.If I'm being honest, then I might even say that my favorite Spider-Man ever is still Nicholas Hammond from the 70s TV movies and TV show. Those movies and episodes have a charming, time capsule appeal and also a welcome lack of CGI, just real practical sets and action scenes. That content is probably the reason why I even entertained the movies of the last 20 years, starting with Maguire, transitioning to Garfield, and moving on with Holland. Spider-Man is a superhero that I've always found watchable. Speaking of, I still say that the best films for both Maguire and Garfield are their first movies Spider-man and TASM, respectively. The first take is unpopular as most people think Spider-Man 2 is not only the best Raimi-Maguire film, but the best superhero movie ever, which I wholeheartedly disagree as I found that movie way more cringe than the first one. And I already said TASM is the best film of all 3 iterations. TASM2 was terrible, though, which I agree with most people. Holland is tricky because I've never really fully liked either Homecoming or Far From Home and in this one, he shares the stage with Maguire and Garfield, so he can't claim all the credit for this movie being so good, although he deserves a lot of it.And as awesome as the heroic Spidey trio was, they must share honors with the supporting cast. First, I surprisingly liked Zendaya as Michelle/MJ for the first time in these movies and this film is the first time where I felt the Peter-MJ chemistry. Then there's Jacob Batalon as the always reliable Ned, who along with Vulture was the main reason I even remotely liked Homecoming. Also, this is definitely Marisa Tomei's best outing as Aunt May as I found her underwhelming in the first 2 movies. This one gave her more depth and importance. Benedict Cumberbatch was on point as Dr. Strange, at least I think so, because I've never watched any other movie this character has been in, including his own, so I have no baseline to compare it to. I just liked his humor and dialogue in this movie. I'll give obligatory credit to JK Simmons as Jameson even though this character always annoyed me in the Raimi movies and he didn't annoy me in this one as much. That's something.Saving the best for last...the VILLAINS! As much as I loved the heroic trio, I think the villains stole the show. The fact that the filmmakers even got all these actors to reprise their roles is great, but that they all had actual chemistry among each other is phenomenal. Alfred Molina (as Doc Ock), Jamie Foxx (as Electro), Thomas Haden Church (as Sandman), Rhys Ifans (as Lizard), and last but certainly not least Willem Dafoe (as Green Goblin) all bring it in this film. In particular, Dafoe was just as good, maybe even better than he was in the original Spider-Man from 2002. This film cemented my belief that Dafoe's Goblin/Norman Osborn is the best villain of all the films of the 3 franchises. Molina was probably the second best performance, appropriate as he was in the 2nd film. Foxx, Church, and Ifans didn't get as much meaty material but fit in perfectly with the ensemble.The 1 less star is for the first 30 minutes. Way too much of that typical modern cringe dialogue and bland interchangeable minor characters before it got to all the good stuff bringing in the multi-verse heroes and villains. Thankfully, the filmmakers relied on this collective troupe of experienced, veteran actors across the 3 franchises and let their natural charisma and talent take over. My only other complaint is that it's to bad the film couldn't bring back James Franco as Harry and Emma Stone as Gwen, for obviously different reasons. I wouldn't have even minded seeing Kirsten Dunst and her annoying version of MJ again! Lol But can't have everything. This movie was so good that it makes me want to see another film for each of Maguire and Garfield to see how their lives played out. At least now, Holland can claim to have starred in a legitimately great Spider-Man film even if he had to share the accolades with the other 2 modern Spideys. In terms of superhero movies since 2010, No Way Home is now a contender for the best.", "Mess of special effects and plot holes, lot's o' poorly written roles": "Looking at the other reviews here makes me wonder if we saw the same movie. For me this movie was NOT EVEN CLOSE as good as \"Far From Home\", which was a smart, well written movie with a heart - it's hard to believe it was the same writing team that produced this. I don't need to see Tom Holland crying again. \"No Way Home\" rapidly becomes a mess of special effects and plot holes, replete with poorly written roles for Tomei, Faveau and Cumberbach (some of Cumberbatch's lines later in the movie are awful). In terms of villains, having more is not necessarily better. Standouts are Zendaya, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx, but even then their presence seems wasted.", "The best Spider-Man movie ever made": "This movie is everything that a Spider-Man fan or marvel fan has expected.

The superhero Avengers fad trend has been overly done, & Hollywood keeps making more & more, & the movies keep getting more & more like out there scripts. Hollywood also keeps trying to do sequel & prequels for movies that came out decades ago, & they need to face facts, sequels basically usually suck.. Sometimes rarely u get a decent 1... The last Bad Boys 3, not half bad! But for Hocus Pocus 2, everybody that grew up to the Sanderson sisters back then & throughout the yrs, were ALL so psyched for the sequel, even though we (children of the early 90s) knew the girls would be alot older. & guess what, the entire world was so disappointed. The sequel almost ruined the original for some. It seems that Hollywood has ran out of stories to tell. & it's been that way for yrs & yrs... Me myself can't even watch the last 2 Avengers, cuz they had to kill off my exact 2 favorite characters... Ironman & Natasha. (Natasha was a favorite cuz we both are named Natasha w/ red hair.) \"Hollywood find ur guy's imagination & charisma! Give us another box office hit that makes it mark.\" Preferably in the gothic romance horror genre!", "It's not as great as what the public says": "Having watched nearly all Spider Man movies from 2002 until 2022, this movie feels like a mashup of all three franchises of Spider Man.It's quite a treat for viewers who get the inside jokes, but the plot suffers a bit from cramping too many characters from three different Spider Man movie series.I would have rated one star less, but the ending was the saving grace.", "It's good!": "A genius marketing play by Disney to bring all the Spider-Man and Spider-Man villains back on the Movie Screen. This movie is filled with Fan Service, but is overlooked because it's Spider-Man. The acting is done well, except for Paula Newman's performance on the bridge. Plot is stupid, but is a masterpiece compared to anything else Disney made that year. If you are a hardcore Spider-Man fan you will not be disappointed. You may even change your view on Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man (incredible actor btw)", "This is the way to do a superhero movie with multiple villains!": "Everything was paced greatly and every second was perfect! Wanted 2 more hours of the interactions between the Spider-Men! By far the best MCU movie, if not the best Spider-Man movie!", "Marvel disappoints me again": "I don't know if I'll ever truly love a marvel movie again. I watched the extended cut version of this movie and it still didn't have enough of Toby McGuire and Andrew Garfield. The combining of the three spider men, was the most exciting part of this whole movie and it didn't happen until the last 30 minutes of the movie. The entire beginning of the movie was entirely too much set-up plot and the ending felt rushed.Nothing frustrated me more than the ending. They decide to do the spell that they should have done from the very beginning! Are you kidding me! I watched almost 3 hours of movie, just for them to go with Plan A.I absolutely loved the nostalgia of bringing back all the villains and spider men of the other movie franchises. I'm actually shocked they didn't have licensing issues with it.", "Wow what a movie! i am speechless about this!": "What a great movie, fun,thrilling and emotional! This movie has it all. Graet star Holland is doing a great job as spiderman, and you will be happy after leaving the bio.I think the biggest surprise was the surprise of all the thing that happens! You think something will happen, but they change it and you will like wow what did i just see! Great movie and a must watch for marvel fans!Thanks again marvel.", "Better even than endgame": "Want saying anything more that I laughed I cried and everything... was the best marvel movie ever I loved it. From the beginning until the end I really hope that we will have more movies like this one from marvel and especially more Spider-Man.", "Another Spider Man for kids.": "This is another Spider Man for kids which for me is a wee bit unfortunate. I would very much have liked a Peter Parker / Spider Man that behaved like a real superhero instead of this na\u00efve kid who constantly thinks he knows better than the grown ups and, of course, constantly bungles things up.In addition I was not too thrilled about the story itself where Spider Man right at the beginning is framed as the bad guy. I know, I know, it is rather consistent with the original comics but Hollywood do not hesitate so change things if they feel like it so why not make a good change for once?The good thing about this movie is the special effects. They are quite cool. Especially the parts in this weird space where Doctor Strange and Spider Man dukes it out. Unfortunately that is pretty much it.The rest of the movie is really dragged down by the childish and stupid behavior of Peter Parker. Him being a real idiot and constantly trying to change the spell was just cringe worthy. Then he continues screwing things up because he do not want notorious criminals to go back to their real place because they will actually die there. Typical Hollywood sob story. Despite what that dumb b... said towards the end, yes Peter Parker you did something wrong, you screwed up big time and the wrong people died because of it.Another thing that was really annoying throughout the movie was listening to that moron Jonah Jameson from The Daily Bugle. He was spewing almost as much fake news as CNN and it just pissed me off every time he was on screen.It is a shame really. One would have thought that, given that they already did the young and immature Spider Man in Spider Man: Far From Home, they could have made him more experienced and mature in this one. You know, character advancement.Instead they just piled on the childish, na\u00efve and immature behavior with a good dose of juvenile jokes making what, with some actual intelligent script writing, could have been a great movie with all those cool special effects (and I really do like Doctor Strange) to be one just barely watchable.", "The fans win": "The fans win that's all that needs to be said. This movie was great. Confirming daredevil is in the mcu all the way to bring back Tobey. This was all i wanted in a marvel movie. Kinda mad about sandman being sand the whole time and wish harry was in the movie james Franco.", "A vague review to avoid giving much away, but I overall liked it a lot": "While Homecoming and Far From Home both functioned as coming of age teen comedies as well as superhero action movies, the third Tom Holland Spider-Man movie is far bigger in scale, feeling more like an Avengers film at times. The charm of having a smaller scale story is missed a little, but at the same time, the ambition and scale does still work pretty well, making for a fun and fast-paced two and a half hours.I can see some people criticising this for being too crowd-pleasing, as there is a lot of fan service, references, and moments that seem designed to get crowds cheering. I didn't feel like it was too cynical. The core of the film - its premise, pacing, acting, action etc - are all solid, so throwing in the crowd pleasing stuff felt mostly earned to me, even it almost crosses the line into becoming ridiculous.There are a few plot things that feel a little rushed and like they don't make complete sense. Maybe they do and the breakneck pacing doesn't always allow things to be entirely clear, I don't know. It means this film could either get quite a bit better or quite a bit worse with a second viewing, but after just one, I'm satisfied. I had a good time watching this, and the crowd did, too.Marvel's had two hits and two misses this year, when it comes to films, in my opinion. I like Eternals and Black Widow less the more I think about them, but got a lot of enjoyment out of both this and Shang-Chi. Am curious to see how much longer they can keep this whole MCU thing going.", "Surprisingly great, but ruined by the story catalyst": "The whole shabang started because Parker wanted his friends get into MIT.Compared to Batman or superman, who had been alienated by their city due to conflicting character flaws, harsh life stories, and human greed, Spider-Man was hated because of some drones that I could barely remember from the last movie.Great acting from Tom, Dr. Strange's own conviction, and a great plot connecting different cinematic universes. All shadowed by the dumb reason why they were in this mess.", "Kids movie 3 or 4": "Third or fourth installment in the kids series, kid spider man, with kid friends, kid antics, kids may like it, but old timers would rejoice at old villains, and that's it, rest is kiddish, adolescentish, wokeish, everything but spidy.", "What a film!": "I've never been into the Marvel much but over Christmas found myself watching the Spider-man's and Avengers and the newest Spider-Man - just wow! Funny, emotional, wild - it had me feeling all the emotions! Great casting, great direction, great cinematography! Go and watch, it's crazy what happens!", "Damn Good": "This movie is the first great Spiderman film in over a decade, combining elements of all three series of Spider-Man films to make a fun, action packed ride that absolutely steals my number one film of year. My biggest criticism of this film is the wild inconsistencies tonally, the most serious scene in the movie is followed almost immediately by a comedy scene, which is then followed by another very serious scene. This also happens for the plot of Spider-Man's exposure, it seems afraid to let serious moments play out at times, The Lizard and Sandman seem like afterthoughts, I felt they could've done more, especially with Sandman and his role in Raimi's trilogy, I can see why they didn't however, because the film already flows so well. Obviously, I recommend it, but I'm sure you've already seen it.", "Nostalgic and Perfect!": "The Idea is purely Fantastic. The Hype was real and it was Worth it!

Is it over yet?": "One of the worst movies of the year? No! One of the worst movies EVER! Literally Put me to sleep. I LOVED homecoming and far from home, so I was soooo looking forward to no way home. I even paid $20 to buy it instead of renting it, as I bought the previous two AFTER renting them. Boring as all get out. We would have stopped the playing of it but we had a guest who wanted to see it through in case it got better. It got worse and worse, even on my 12-foot screen. Time and movie I will never get back, but thanks to me, THEY got richer. But I will NEVER AGAIN buy before viewing.", "Sometimes the end of one adventure is just the beginning of another": "I saw Spider-Man: No Way Home last night and I had to put together a review because this was not only one of the best MCU movie ever made but also one of the best superhero movies ever made. So here we go (Huge spoilers ahead!):Plot Breakdown:So the movie kicks off right after the end credits scene from Far From Home and Peter has to deal with the consequences of the world finding out he is Spider-Man. He, MJ, Ned and May are questioned but nothing sticks as Mr. Murdock comes to help them. Then they move to another apartment in an attempt to escape the growing mob attacking Peter's house. At the same time MJ, Ned and Peter try to apply for MIT but they all get rejected which sets the main plot and the future films with Spider-Man perfectly. They all get rejected and Peter goes to Doctor Strange to have everyone forget that he is Spider-Man. Doctor Strange agrees and does a spell to have everyone forget Peter was Spider-Man, but Peter tempers with the spell and tries to alter it mid-way through and that changes the spell in a way in which not even Strange knows how it would turn out. So Peter finds out from Flash that a vice chancellor from the MIT is travelling to the airport so he goes to talk to her and convince her to let Ned and MJ in the MIT. This is where doc Ock attacks and he unmasks Peter to see that he isn't his Peter. Ock's arms get taken over by Peter's suit, but then the Green Goblin attacks and Spider-Man and Ock get teleported into Strange's prison. Then Strange explains that the spell worked in the way that it pulled all the people who knew Peter Parker was Spider-Man. He also caught the Lizard and placed it into the prison. So they plan to capture them all and send them back. So Peter brings Ned and MJ to help him with catching the villains. The next is Electro... so Peter goes into a forest and there he gets attacked by Electro but saved in the last minute by Flint Marko. He destroys the electricity towers and then cages the Electro. After that Norman comes to May and Peter takes him to the rest of the villains. Then Strange comes and he and Spidey fight over getting the bad guys home or helping them. That was one of the most craziest fight scene I've seen in the MCU. Peter ultimately wins with a genius display of Peter's intelligence, traps Strange in the mirror dimension and takes his ring which opens portals. They fix then Octavius but then Peter senses something is off. So Green Goblin and Electro storm off and May gets killed by Goblin's glider. This was heartbreaking to see happening to Peter, after first losing Tony his father figure in Endgame. Then we see MJ and Ned who are back at Ned's home deciding if they ought to activate the box Strange made to destroy the original spell. Then Ned opens a portal and a Spider-Man comes through and it's Andrew Garfield's Spidey. Then he tries again and finds Tobey Maguire's Peter. They find Tom together with Ned and MJ and talk him out of sending all the Spideys and villains back (Just a quick disclaimer, I will be naming the different Peters and Spideys by their respective actors names). Then they develop a cure for everyone and go the statue of Liberty in order to draw them all out and fix them. At first the three Spider-Men don't work together too well but after a quick pep talk they swing together and manage to cure Electro, Lizard and Sandman. The last being the Goblin who comes and destroys the scaffolding from the Statue and MJ falls while Tom tries to save her but he is then taken by the Goblin so Andrew jumps after her and saves her. The fight ends with a fantastic fist fight between Tom and Norman and as Tom was about to impale him with his glider Tobey comes and stops him only to be stabbed by the Goblin. Then Andrew throws the cure to Tom and he cures him. The movie ends with Tom suggesting Strange who was brought back by Ned, to make another spell to make everyone forget he is Peter and that would stop the first spell. Everyone forgets Tom's Spidey was Peter and then Peter goes to MIT and moves into his own apartment (Tobey vibes there... the only thing that was missing was mr. Ditkovich asking him for rent) and starting his own life of being the friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man with a new hand-made comic book-ish costume.End of Plot BreakdownThis was without a doubt for me, one of the best MCU movies, right up there with Infinity War and Endgame. You will hear many people say this is the most fan service fan service could be. But this movie isn't all about that. There are way more great things this movie does. The 2 standouts aside from Tom Holland (because this is his movie) for me were Willem Defoe and Andrew Garfield. The latter one has so much fun with his character. It is incredible to see what a great actor he is and what an amazing Peter Parker he can be with a competent script. I loved him in this movie even though I didn't really liked him in his own 2 movies. Willem Defoe is I would say the greatest shine overall in all the Spider-Man movies. He is truly incredible after all these years playing the Goblin with the same menace and cunning that made him a legend in the first Raimi movie. What I also loved about this movie is that they not only brought the villains from the Tobey and Andrew's movies but they also improved them, and I'm not talking only in terms of costume (which were improved for Electro and Goblin) but also their characters especially Electro and the Lizard which suffered the most in the Garfield's movies. Also the villains interactions were mesmerizing. To see Doc Ock and Norman interact with each other after being in separate movies in Raimi's original trilogy was truly a dream come true. Also Electro and Lizzard's interactions were neat. The only one that felt a bit like a spare wheel was Lizard, who in terms of plot didn't have much to do and affect the story. Another not so great thing was Doc Ock. Props though for Alfred Molina for coming back after all these years and still portraying doc Ock in the way we knew him. The only gripe I might have with his portrayal is that he gets less screen time than other villains and he at times is played for jokes. Him being cured at the mid point of the movie meant he wasn't part in the big battle at the end but only cured Electro and met with Tobey. It was okay overall, can't fault the movie for that, it was the obvious path for his character. But the best thing in this movie has to be the interactions between the three Spider-Men. They felt like they were brothers all this time and they all had a big part in the movie not only appearing for a cameo at the end to help Tom's Spidey. The best scene concerning the three Spider-Men has to be Andrew's rescue of MJ which redeems his character in way I never thought possible, and quite frankly it has to be one of the best character redemption scenes in any movie ever! Next one was Tobey's Peter stopping Tom from impaling Norman with his own glider. This time he stops Norman from getting killed with his own glider and also pays a small price for that by getting stabbed. Also, the ending is probably the best ending to a MCU movie and maybe to a Spider-Man movie. Speaking of Spider-Man movies, you could really see there was a vision here for Tom's version. To have him grow from a kid in the first two movies into a definitive hero by the end of this movie. It's so satisfying to watch that and it really puts to shame other studios trilogies that bombed, had no plan from the beginning and brought original members from older movies only for cheap nostalgia pandering to then disrespect them. This movie respects and honors every other Spider-Man movie that came before and moves the story in an interesting new direction building the main character properly in the process. It wouldn't be fair to talk only about the positives and not pin point some flaws this movie had: like the first half of hour of this movie has some off-placed humor and some strange behavior from characters like Ock and Tom's Peter with Strange when he does the spell. Even though this is the kick-start of the plot it is kind of weirdly executed and a bit cringy at time. This gripe I would say it's only present in the first 30 minutes - 1 hour of the movie. The first part of the movie is the one that seems a bit more like a comedy with some cringe inducing moments and humor that either hits or misses. After the point doc Ock appears in the highway the movie picks up and there's no turning back. Also there's a joke before the big battle at the end with Tobey's back which seemed a bit strange. I would have rather have that Spider-Men pointing at each other meme done in the scene. But these minor gripes won't take away from what was truly a remarkable movie that honored everything that came before it and prepared the way for a new story going forwards. I wish more movies were made like this one today. This will truly be remembered as a landmark in superhero movies and in franchise movies in generally. 10/10One last thing before I go... there were so many people involved in making this movie. I encourage you to support the creators of this movie because they truly deserve and go see the movie in theatre. Let's show movies like these should get made more often!", "Marvel capitalizes on its biggest character": "Tom Holland wraps up his first (and hopefully not last) Spider-Man trilogy with a major blockbuster. To put a bow on a year where movies made a comeback, what better way to do so than with a Marvel thriller that many had been looking for and hadn't received until now. Director, Jon Watts (Spider-Man: Homecoming, Spider-Man: Far From Home) continues his relatable portrayal of the web-slinger in his 3rd straight Spider-Man film as he prepares to revamp another Marvel series that has yet to find its voice in \"The Fantastic Four\".Synopsis:\"With Spider-Man's identity now revealed, our friendly neighborhood web-slinger is unmasked and no longer able to separate his normal life as Peter Parker from the high stakes of being a superhero. When Peter asks for help from Doctor Strange, the stakes become even more dangerous, forcing him to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man.\"What You See, Feel, and HearYou can't typically create a superhero film, especially one of this magnitude, without the massive use of CGI and green screens. However, ever since the creation of Marvel Studios, Marvel has been able to implement a fluency with the way they create their action and environments to keep their films as relatable as possible, and this goes to show in Spider-Man: No Way Home. As I watch a film of this caliber in regards to the character portrayal I can't help but imagine the difficulty of authenticity as these actors and actresses perform stunts, express emotions, and share dialogue with a completely different environment than what's being shown on screen. While watching a superhero film I'm a major fan of the POV camera positioning. Very few times does the audience get the chance to look through the lens of a superhero character and No Way Home utilized a variety of camera positions to keep the audience immersed with each character which added a level of investment as the film went on.Out of the 3 MCU Spider-Man films, you feel the most emotion with this film. From moments of major highs, and moments of major lows, Jon Watts tested the boundaries of emotions unlike his other films and each moment seemed to fit right into place. With a seamless balance of realistic humor and genuine fear we see the growth of Tom Holland within this specific character unlike we did with the first two films. Spider-Man is a relatable character, and because of his on-screen appearances since the character's creation in 1962 the audience has a greater attachment to him compared to others within the MCU such as characters from Shang-Chi or The Eternals. Because of that attachment I think there's a level of difficulty in separating nostalgic emotions vs. Neutral viewership when reflecting on this film.Dialogue and execution are major focal points. With a more well rounded chemistry between Tom Holland's Spider-Man and Zendaya's MJ, their conversations and circumstances start holding higher value than ever before. This film provides a darker energy comparable to Avengers Infinity War and likewise has an unpredictable ending. In addition, we experience the best performance and scariest interpretation of a Spider-Man villain up to date.My TakeUp until I saw this movie twice, I believed Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse to be the best Spider-Man film. That has now changed. I have never put as much investment into a film as I have with this one. For a year straight I would listen and watch trusted sources dive into the story of this character and share countless predictions and I can't express how excited I was to watch this film. Because of that investment I made sure to watch the film twice; once to purely take in the experience, and once to analyze the film. Both times were exceptionally satisfying. With minor critiques on the use of CGI in certain scenes, the acting performances were great, the story was captivating, and Marvel certainly didn't disappoint with who I believe is now their biggest character.Grade: 9.1/10.", "Wow it was so good": "Wow I never think I'm some day we have movie like this 3 spider man it's kind of wearied to see all of them in one scene androw toby tom best actor ever.", "Yes, it is 8 star superhero movie": "Can this movie be more good? Absolutely. Is it already good? Yes definitely.This movie have so much things in their pocket to make this one really, really good. And they do use most of them, almost to the amount that this can be perfect.The stories are gonna feel little bit faster from the middle of the movie, but that's okay I guess. They take time to make the foundation of starting stories really strong. That's good. They give us what most of us expected.Almost every act feel A class acting. Also thanks to the actor that they bring from another universe that has a really A class acting.I only wish the Spider-Man's can have more action scenes. OverallBeautiful, fun movie.", "Nostolgia made this movie for me": "So Yes, I, of course, went to see Spider-Man No Way Home. I was never a fan of the MCU version of Spider-Man; he never felt like Spider-Man to me, which was a huge problem. I thought Homecoming was wrong, but over time, I think, up to this day that the movie was just mid (okay), but I hated Far From Home; for me, it is worst than The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3, and with that leaving a sour taste in my mouth. And with that film, I was never going to be interested in a third Holland Spider-Man movie. Until they announced that Jaime Foxx would return, Foxx, spoiled the film for me that it was a Spider-verse movie. And over the years, I heard news and articles about the movie, and I tried my best not to get THAT level of spoiled. And on opening day I was there with my family and friends, and we saw No Way Home... And yes, the nostalgia is so natural in the movie. The story is pretty bad, and some things left me to say ok.Cons: The first half was terrible. We don't see much of the aftermath of Peter's identity reveal, and we don't see him struggle that much in his life. Instead, we see Peter act like everything is normal. And that shouldn't be the case; we should see Peter's journey. But, unfortunately, Disney/Sony played it safe from all the cruel things that could happen, and we don't see much of HIS consequences. I hoped everything that I wanted to see was what he was going through, and for everything that was happening in his life, does he get harassed a lot in the time off during this elevate. Shouldn't he get his house and his school break-in? Shouldn't thieves and robbers be trying to break into his house? He should have fought them. Also, we didn't get to see him in court; we didn't even get an extended scene of what the court would say, like In Daredevil season 3, when they talked about murder. But the essential thing that triggered him to go to Doctor Strange for help was that he and his friends didn't get into college, the college they wanted instead, of having one of his friends end up in a hospital or seeing anybody cares hurt, which could have been way better than what we got. Also, what annoyed me was when Doctor Strange separated from him when he separated his spirit from his body. HE SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. How could that happen? To this day, I am baffled to see how he ended up getting his body back. But what is worse is that I didn't even cry for Aunt May's death. This should be emotional, yet it wasn't as powerful as it should be, and that is because she was never betrayed as a good woman figure to Peter in all of these movies, and yet it felt like a one and done. In Homecoming, we should have seen her do something and be more of an ACTUAL mother figure than a babysitter to Peter. Yeah, they did a lot of \"inspiration\" from the Playstation 4 game. Yeah, the game is way better than this film in all aspects.And now the Pros: Seeing Charlie Cox, Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, Willem Defoe, Alfred Molina, Jaime Foxx, Rhys Ifans, and Thomas Haden Church reprise their roles from shows and movies that I enjoy up to this very day was brilliant. I was worried that they would have been nerfed into the comedy and weak side from the MCU. But that didn't happen, and I could not be more than happy that they did that. I am so happy to see Chalie Cox as his lawyer (even though I would like to see more of him). The villains are done justice, and they remember each other during the events of their time, not as villains, but from their past. And Spider-Man helping these victims was a true Spider-Man thing to see. But the show-stealer was Willem Defoe as Green Goblin, and he still is the best villain of all time; he is 66 years old and does all the stunts himself. So we have a true legend right here, and seeing Tobey Maguire talk with Alfred Molina and Thomas Hayden Church and when Andrew Garfield talk to Jaime Foxx feels home to me. I am a massive fan of both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, and seeing them interact and do perfectly in this movie was terrific. But I wish we had an even longer talk with all three Spider-Man, cause it was hilarious and perfect, and they made the web organic shooter joke. And Tobey being the one to stop Tom from killing the Green Goblin, was applauding. Although we should have gotten a talk from Tobey Maguire and Willem Defeo, I am to see that he becomes the Spider-Man we know today at the end of the day.I am happy with the fact that we got a real-life Spider-Verse movie. However, I wish it could have been better. And we could have gotten more from his struggle than a Spider-Verse movie. And sorry but Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse is still the superior Spider-verse movie. And boy did this hurt and sting for me. I give No Way Home a 10/10. Why? Nostalgia made up for it.", "Unlike many I found the story very weak": "Let's start with fist hour everthing happens because peter is a idiot and teen. Then Villians comes and he think we must save them. Story end they fight spidermen win. Everyone happy only universe unhappy.I didn't enjoy the story because everthing is so forced like we can cure why didn't you then I must ask. Only way I understand is spiderman has level of intellect so much yet no wisdom can do anything. Sandman is idiot I still can't understand him why he becomes villian. Electro is electro np. Osborne is only strong character I must respect the actor all point to him. Octavius is same I have np. Dr connor is idiot. 30 minute to solve all sickness is so weak There are no way this movie deserve 10 I can understand people giving it 9 they love concept but they know story is forced. 8 and 7 is still ok. But 10 you say this movie have no issue perfect. Man If spiderman so smart to solve all sickness all issues that fast many marvel movies are just s...t\nIf thing were like this villians comes heroes comes they fight strange help and collect them some become good guys others do not change maybe they save octavius or connor with other spiderman's solution but that's it.In short Spiderman comes with solution to cure all so they don't die in their movies(Where is venom) spiderman cures but he is too late peter parker must be forgotten and solution. Will you give that story 10/10 as a reader or watcher of many movies since 1980s I can't even I loved the story I would give 8 to be honest but I think it was so boring first hour was just empty hour last hour is just solution. If you write the story it doesn't even make a fair article it makes poor article problem and solution but no story. You give one lost and some crying + jokes that makes it still half article start and end.So in my opinion this movie deserve 6 and I think I'm unfair because I love spiderman, people who doesn't know character would give it 5 or 4.", "High on VFX & Nostalgia": "I tried to watch it after all the hype & yeah this is an enjoyable film but nowhere near the best Spiderman film. The storyline was as thin as paper & was extremely predictable. You can just summarize the whole plot in just 2 sentences. The acting was good mainly from the Dr. Strange & other supporting cast but Tom Holland's character came to the point when it became a really annoying high school kid. I mean he's trying to save everyone & let everyone forget about him but man he just can't shut up when something important was happening on screen.The main drawbacks for me were the lackluster editing, the long runtime which made it somewhat extremely boring with the conversations & the humour was also at the same level as the other marvel movies - too childish & cheesy.The biggest USP here are the previous characters in spiderman films we all grew up watching. I was really excited when they bring previous spideys especially Toby(who is my fav one) & Andrew Garfield was 'amazing'. Bringing back my other fav character from the MCU - Matt Murdock for a few seconds really seemed pointless to me. The antagonist from the previous films were great & so many but there was still not a proper one. Alfred Molina as Dr. Octavius really shines, Jamie Foxx as electro was looking hella cool (in a good way) & the other villians also played their part well but Willam Dafoe as green goblin steals the whole show & was the highlight for this one who should've been given more focus by the writer as per my view.The special effects were obviously great but overused like the other marvel films & can give a headache to an adult or a mature viewer.Overall this was a fun but predictable watch & not the best spiderman film for me as the Sam Raimi's one still holds the special place for me. If you're a teenager you obviously gonna love this & give this a 10 but for a more mature audience who is looking for great story & strong characters can look somewhere else.", "Kinda garbage": "Super predictable, trailer was misleading, Tobey looked like a drug addict, serious cringe between the 3 spidermen, green goblin was predictable and boring, sandman appeared like 2 times, same for the lizard man.Cringe fest with no real story dialog and the ending was predictable.", "Wow Sony and Marvel are doing something great": "I don\u00b4t know why marvel movies are so good, but there is something about them.. the story the thrillers the fun stuff.. when you watch the DC universe you don\u00b4t get anything from them, but from Marvel it is always nearly perfect.I recommend this movie, it was a alot of fun and alot of emotional stuff as well.Great movie.", "Atrocious": "This was so cheesy it makes mature cheddar seem bland. If you think this movie has ANY substance you trying way too hard to fit in with the crowd cos this is the most plastic Spider-Man ever.", "Yawn!": "I like a good action film and I enjoy my marvel movies. I found this film to be boring beyond belief. And the graphics (though brilliant) are insufficient to rescue it ffrom dreariness. Scenes drwan out way past their need. There is only so much teenage awkwardness that one can tolerate and this is so soaked in it that it's leaden! This film could quite easily have fitted into half it's running time. I understand a bit of padding. This film is the digital \"Michelin Man\"", "11/10": "Best spiderman movie ever!Andrew's emotinial scanes was absolutly felt true. When Tom said \" Great power\", Tobey was like, \"i heard that before, the sentence that changed my life.\" than complates that sentence. That thing is the reason spiderman is become spiderman so i think that was tom's spiderman's break point. That's why after everyone he loves and who loves him forgot about him he is gone somewhere and live alone. Than TRUE SPIDERMAN BEGINS BABY! WHOO!!", "Hard to relate": "I was 8 years old when Sam Raimi's Spider-man came out and blew our mind. It was a move that mase us jump from couch to couch, just like spidey, quote the characters, and play through the movie in our backyard. Then we got Spider-man 2-3, later Amazing Spider-man 1-2 with Andrew Garfield and later Tom Holland's take on the role.I always liked the dorky, relatable Peter, who struggles in life, has time management issues, tries to protect his friends, love interest and has real life problems. Tobey's version was perfect for this, and I think for this reason he's still the best Peter Parker.Unfortunatelly I didn't like the Amazing Spider-man versions that much, the story wasn't that interesting, only the acting and the chemistry saved it between Andrew and Emma. But the ending - for me - was and still one of the boldest moment in standalone superhero movies. It was The Night Gwen Stacy died.Tom Holland's spidey first came in Civil War, he was one of the many heroes in that movie, but he was likeable, fresh and fun so he got his standalone movies combined with following Avengers movies. Marvel always had issues with its movies. The antagonist is always the same (daddy issue) and the story never seen to risk big with one or two exceptions. We're always running the same circles.But why did I had to write all these before even mentioning No Way Home? Because it seemed different, it seemed bold, risky and maybe fresh again. But then I went to see it.My problem with Tom Holland's version of Peter that I can't relate. He's not dorky, he's actually talented and people recognize his talent. He has a bright future, love interests, a good friend, a loving environment and more importantly: always someone to look up, a mentor. He doesn't need to struggle finding his own path because its right in front of him and he knows it. No big struggle here. No everyday problems in his life.No Way Home starts when Far from Home end credit scene ended: The world knows that he's spider-man and thinks he killed Mysterio. Big problem? Tony Stark told the world he was Iron Man, Captain America never had a secret life and so on. Just prove your innocence and that's it. No need to ask Strange to use his magic to forget the world that he's spider-man. But he does, and interferes with the spell, the multiverse cracks up and people starts to come to his world. Only the ones with the knowledge that Peter Parker is Spider-man. That means Octopus, Green Goblin, Lizard, Electro and Sandman. Ohh and the two other Peter Parkers. Because they're here.So if you're not familiar with the old movies, this movie will mean almost nothing. Marvel did a 180 turn and said \"You need to know every superhero movie to understand this one\". Not just from the MCU, but every other. This was risky, probably payed off because the first movie is only 19 years old.It's truly good to see all three Spider-mans sharing the screen, referencing memes, using their own skills. The problem is all the best and brightest moments are references to the old movies. Andrew is still a hell of an actor. You can tell, he didn't just catch MJ, he catched himself too (probably one of the best MCU moments). Tobey's interaction with Otto is sweet and throws back to your childhood. The problem is they're not pushing forward the main story, Tom Holland's character. He's somewhere there in the background with the problem: everyone needs to forget him. And they do. And I'm afraid that years later I'll forget him too, because his standalone trilogy was good because of the other 2 Spider-mans. Now he's only Spider-man, not Peter Parker.", "Oh my god": "Couldn't take my eyes off the screen.Couldn't believe what I was watching.I screamed.I cried.I jumped.This is definitely and easily in the top 3 MCU movies.I locked myself up in my bedroom and stayed away from internet to enjoy it without a single spoiler: best decision I've ever made. Do the same, you'll thank me.", "A Spider-Man Movie I Never Knew I Needed": "Whether you're talking about classic comic books, animated television shows, or live-action films, Spider-Man has been in my life for decades. Not only has the character been my favourite superhero throughout my life, but I've loved watching every adaptation as well. I viewed all three Sam Raimi films on repeat as they were released and the same went for Marc Webb. The animated Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse was also a fantastic surprise a few years ago. As the Marvel Cinematic Universe grew and they began to include Tom Holland as the web-slinger, I was falling in love with the character all over again. Even if I had issues with any of the movies, the character has always put a smile on my face. When I started hearing what Spider-Man: No Way Home was going to be about, there was no way I wouldn't be there on opening night. With that groundwork laid out, let's dive in.This film picks up immediately following the events of Spider-Man: Far From Home. Peter Parker's identity has now been released to the world and many believe him to be a murderer. Not knowing what to do with his life at this point, he seeks the help of Doctor Strange to try and wipe the memory that anyone knows who he is. It goes awry and villains from all of the Spider-Man films begin to emerge. From here, the story itself becomes something that can't be talked about in a review. All I will say is that the last hour of this film had me in tears on multiple occasions, emotionally or not.Tom Holland has impressed me as this character since his very first appearance in Captain America: Civil War. From there, he has done nothing but immensely improve on that performance in his own films, but I have never seen him this committed to this role. The way he carries emotion in his eyes or simply just has fun in the suit is unparalleled. On top of his great performance, this is also the absolute best that both Zendaya and Jacob Batalon have been as his friends/support. This trio soars in this film.From the score by Michael Giacchino making me emotional to the raw human drama I wasn't expecting, I will say that I've never felt the weight and stakes in a Spider-Man movie as much as I felt them here. What I also really enjoyed is that Spider-Man: No Way Home feels the most distant from the Marvel Cinematic Universe than the other two. The burden of needing to connect to that world has been a minor issue of mine, but this film nearly always puts Spider-Man front and center, giving him his first real, full story. I really don't want to speak further about the revelations throughout the film, or even the villains because I believe everything in that regard is so well-done and deserves to be seen by fans first.Overall, if I had to complain about anything, I would say that the first 20 minutes of this film felt a little rushed, even in the editing. I completely understood they wanted to get to the good stuff, but before the plot really gets moving, it felt a little choppy to me. With that said, that's a pretty minor complaint, seeing as I was still blown away by a lot of this film. Jon Watts has done a great job directing this trilogy of films and I can't wait to see what he's going to do with Fantastic Four. The last hour of Spider-Man: No Way Home is everything I wanted to see in a live-action Spider-Man, but I didn't quite realize how much I needed it. Walking out of this film, I wasn't wanting to rave about it because I knew I loved it, but I wanted to sit on it and really admire the effort here. Although not perfect by any means, Spider-Man: No Way Home is still a triumph and one of the most enjoyable moviegoing experiences I've had in a while.", "Great Idea": "One of the finest spider man movies of all time. Multiverse concept was really awesome. Watching Tobey Maguire was really refreshing. Really a big thumps up to the makers. A serious must watch.", "Best movie in 2021": "It's not a dream anymore , I really loved this movie. Never thought I will see tobey, andrew, and Tom all together in one movie. You Cannot say anything because this movie has it all.", "Too complicated": "+ MJ\n+ Multiple new bad guys\n+ Surprise return of a previous actor from Spiderman moviesThe story was too complicatedThe jokes were too commonThe movie was too long.", "Refreshing twists": "There is a lot of humour in Spider-Man: No Way Home. Certainly a larger dosage than in the previous Spider Man stories. Without spoiling the elements of this particular sequel, the superhero is confronted with more human realities and aside from the necessary drama, he plays along at exploring ludicrous situations and taking the Mickey out of himself.There is a phenomenal cast of actors who give top marks performances and also a very classy use of special effects and CGI.So what is so different about this Spiderman story? The conclusion or ending which is neither of them or better a vehicle to open new possibilities. This is the moment when the screenplay acts one of the best pieces of visual storytelling.", "To Be Objective": "I had a great time watching this film because I loved the originals and didn't mind Andrew Garfield's run either. Yes. This movie is a movie for kids. Yes. Spider-Man fans will enjoy this film. BUT. If you are just a regular movie goer, only expect a decent to somewhat enjoyable time. If you haven't seen a Spider-Man without Tom Holland, you'll be missing something when you watch this, and if you don't have the nostalgia, you're mind won't cover up the countless flaws. For me, it was probably an 8 when I watched it but if I'm gonna try and be realistic it is not an 8 for the average person.The CGI is actually quite bad for a blockbuster and very noticeable, bordering on cartoon. The dialogue is what you'd expect from Marvel and when the humour doesn't land, the pause could fill the multiverse. I don't know why they have so many 'pause for laugh' moments, it just hurts the pacing and the runtime. The plot collapses under its own weight and makes absolutely no sense if you think about any part of it but since it's a movie for kids this isn't the biggest atrocity. The acting has some standout moments and good chemistry but some characters feel wasted or unnecessary. Others are betrayed by the writers, given weak motivations to be used as tools to further the plot.You should have some fun with this movie despite my negative critiques. It can hit emotional beats, even if they are clich\u00e9. The actors and prior knowledge of these characters and franchise really elevates the bland script and nonsensical plot. For what the film was going for I think it did fairly well, so it gets a 6. I would recommend it for any child or Spider-Man fan but otherwise don't expect to be blown away.", "A really good movie? Yes! The 16th best movie in cinema history? No way!": "I really liked this movie and I think I'm not alone when I say this is the best SpiderMan movie we have gotten so far. However, I think the current score of this movie is EXTREMELY exaggerated. In my opinion, there is no way this movie can surpass other movies like Back to the Future, The Pianist, Interstellar, The Matrix, etc. That's why I rate this movie with a 1, in hopes the overall score matches the Avengers Infinity War 8.4 score for example, which would be more realistic in my opinion. If this happens I will change my score for sure.Now, about the movie itself, it really stands out as one of the best creations of the MCU. It has really exciting moments that could make almost any audience roar, it has scenes that will pull your heart strings, it has thoughtful lessons that will remind you about the Sam Raimi's movies, basically everything a SpiderMan fan could ask for. Although I felt the fan-service was too obvious sometimes, I can't deny it was used cleverly. This is the perfect closure for this trilogy and maybe one of the best (if not the best) movie of the MCU.EDIT: The score of the movie went down to an 8.5, so I changed my score as promised.", "Extremely generic plot, dissapointing, mostly leaning on nostalgia.": "You may disagree with me when it comes to the second half of the movie, but especially the first half, drags on and on about conversations, Doctor Strange acting extremely out-of-character and the \"Wong\" race against the clock becoming meaningless extremely quickly.There is no plot here. It's just characters from other dimensions who have no emotional connection to the main character whatsoever fighting each-other. No background stories for these characters, no emotional weight considering they are all cameos anyway.Aunt May dying is sad of course, but she's the least emotional weighted character for the audience over the course of the 3 movies. It'd be better if she hadn't died at all, it feels forced.The fan service and nostalgia overwhelms immensely. The old movies were wrapped up, why do we only get cameos from some of the characters, what about all the fun side characters from the old movies?This movie is worse than Space Jam 2, because that one at least had a conflict between the dad and the son.", "The Amazing Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-man": "Besides the force plot points in the beginning, the whole movie was just wow. Consequences is what has been missing the recent Marvel movies and this movies really did bring that in. It hammered you down and some more towards the end.Sure it probably won't affect some people but wow it hit my heart hard.It also helps if you have been following all the Spiderman movies, from Tobey to Andrew, especially Andrew. He was great. Awesome... some of the scenes just hit hard just by looking from his eyes. It's truly a great year for Andrew Garfield.I also thought Dr. Strange played a bigger role but he appeared in just the right amount of scenes (including a really cool fighting scene) (Also it was his own fault for messing up the spells too honestly and didn't discuss it in detail.)And I hope the people that has been complaining about the Stark influence is happy at the end. But the poor boy just kept being miserable.", "They are here!": "A great story, the 17 year old kid's stupidity drive sthe movie plot and this is an amazing spiderman movie!The hype is real, I won't say much just experice this on the screens.", "So....": "No body gonna mention HOW MANY PLOT HOLES THIS MOVIE HAS????But... ohh noooo its Spider-man.... uhh 10/10I AM SORRY BUT NO...\nGood movie but should be at least 5 hours.I know the hyped is real here with all the Marvel girlfans but this 9.1 is extra outrages... FAKE RATING from a fake fans.", "Great movie. Great emotions.": "I was really looking forward to watch it and I was not left disappointed. I think it was a brilliant idea bringing back the previous spider-man and they just had such a great chemistry together. It was very emotional to me to see then back as each one of them played spider so well. The whole movie was packed with surprises, good acting, good action and good writing.I see some ppl giving 1 but that's is just stupid.", "Marvel + Sony = Happiness": "Not only was this movie amazing in every way (funny, emotional, suspenseful, action-packed), but the ability to do a movie about a multi-verse and pull it off using previous actors and characters is something most people could only dream of. I really hope to see more expansion into the Spider-verse because it is seemingly endless on possibilities. I'm so glad I got to see this movie in the theater with my son!", "HISTORIC FILM SEQUEL!!!": "OMG... this film exceeded all my expectations from start to finish, from the ALL STAR cast to the action scenes to \"THE WORST KEPT SECRET\" in the entire film!!!A HISTORIC FILM SEQUEL for Spider-Man!! GO SEE IT!!", "0815": "I can't understand the high rating. It's by no means one of the best films of all time. It's not even the best Spiderman movie. It is suitable for a Saturday evening with popcorn. The film lasts 2.5 hours but too much material that one wanted to accommodate. Too many villains and too many Spidermans.", "A good conclusion": "If Tom Holland really wants to step away from Spider-Man then this was really a great way. The 3rd Tom holland Spider-Man wraps up in a great way leaving it open to either continue the saga or to leave it at a stopping point.The movie itself is a slow burner with lots of fan service served just right. Everyone did great, the score was great, the visuals were great. Only thing for me was that it was a slow burner and the 2nd act dragged on. And really I could have waited for stearming( my moive theater choices are slim and out dated with compact seating ).", "Disney know to listen the fans": "Marvel team did it again, one of the best Marvel film to date, full joy, dont know what to say... watch it in theaters! And Imax too!Great job in vilan engagement and best acting from Tom to date too.", "What Walter Williams Is Watching": "With great power comes great responsibility.So, even writing this review I feel the weight on my shoulders and promise not to give away any spoilers.Your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man as created by Stan Lee has come a long way since 1962.At \"No Way Home's\" core Spider-Man's identity is now revealed publicly on electronic billboards as it flows seamlessly from \"Far From Home\".This time round \"Peter Parker\" asks \"Doctor Strange\", the marvellous Benedict Cumberbatch, for help.When a magic spell goes wrong, dangerous arch nemesis from other worlds appear, forcing Peter to discover what it truly means to be a Spider-Man.Tom Holland reprises his role as Peter.The in-demand Zendaya (Dune) is back as \"MJ\" ( a nice allusion to the original Mary Jane) with their best friend, \"Ned Leeds\" played by Jacob Batalon plus the wannabe best friend \"Flash Thompson\" played by Tony Revolori who's even written a book about his \"friendship\".It was also great to see one of the worlds best actors J. K. Simmons return as \"J Jonah Jameson\" in a new media role.This movie made me realise what's been missing from cinemas during this pandemic...people!Live audiences are part of the big screen experience that you can't get at home with your family and friends.Their reaction to the introduction of certain characters and references and memes to previous movies in the Spider verse made the movie jump off the screen and into the aisles.There are so many surprises for you that I don't want to spoil any of them.Suffice to say \"No Way Home\" is like a Jukebox playing the greatest hits of the Marvel Cinema Universe for heroes and villains.The script ranges from hilarious at times, but also will move you to tears during the drama and pathos.The fight scenes have to be seen to be believed especially on an iconic Bridge and at a famous New York landmark.This film marks the first MCU trilogy to be directed by the same director, Jon Watts.All previous film franchises like Iron Man & Captain America had only two consistent directors throughout their trilogies.Do NOT leave before the end credits, where you get an Easter Egg and a trailer for an upcoming movie.Both lay out vital clues for future films in the MCU.Come get some Superhero action in a Multi-verse that will blow your mind.", "The Spiderman": "I must admit that I am not a big fan of Spiderman, but I watched all the movies and I liked them. Now...this one is the best Spiderman movie I have ever seen!First of all, it connects three generations of Peter Parker, and that is a big burden to carry. But this movie manages to do it very well! There were some scenes that were really well shot, like the one where Peter looks at J. Jonah Jameson speaking in a big screen, while it's dark and it rains or the final fight with Goblin.Doctor Strange is also fantastic and Benedict Cumberbatch steals the scene every time he is on screen.The action sequences were fantastic and seeing all the old villains reunite was so cool!Overall, this is one of the best MCU movies, and it deserves a 10/10.PS.: Daredevil returns...and it is a very welcome news!", "Spectacular, Spectacular!": "To put it all in a nutshell:\nBrilliant visuals, awesome and surprising twists and a story that both considers the older spider-man movies as well as develops its own speed and tone even convinced me, who is not up to date when it comes to Marvel, to give this movie standing-ovations!", "Everything is just unbelievable Except": "Everything in the movie is unbelievable except for Tom Holland that he's not good at all to be Spider-Man. I hope the next Spider-Man will do well for this role.", "A pleasure trip that is full of nostalgia and fun": "Before I start jotting down my own assessment, I have to clear some things up; In general, I love to watch Superhero/Comicbook adaptations. I'm also a genuine admirer of Marvel and the content they produce. I have followed the entirety of their Cinematic Universe (Including the standalone shows) doing that subsequently, I had always wanted nothing but what's best for them. But that doesn't necessarily oblige me to give favourable feedback nor does it compel me to abstain from constructive criticisms; as a film analyst, it's my duty to convey my feelings with utmost honesty, and I will do just that.No Way Home is far off from the superiority I was being foretold. The film heavily banks upon the valuable memories and the attachments people have with this franchise or the character of Spider-Man in general. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy the ride, matter of fact I did. To get all the different variations of Spider-Man in a single frame, was a brilliant decision coming from the makers' side. To see Toby Maguire, Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland partaking in combats against the bad guys and having some laughs and fun while doing it; well, it was a sight to behold, an invaluable moment for the fans to cherish.And that's what this film stands for right? It's a fan service more than anything else. Catered towards the demands and desires of the franchise's fanbase. However, if you don't consider yourself a fanatic and don't bother putting all these nostalgic elements on the side, then you've got a script, that I'm afraid doesn't even qualify to be evaluated as a great piece of writing (Considering Marvel's usual standards).The screenplay isn't always high on momentum, it's very uneven with the pace. Some of the characters, the 'antagonists' in particular had little to no material to work with. Although I understand, it must have been pretty difficult to bring 'em all into a solitary feature. If it was any different production, I wouldn't have minded, but this is Marvel we are talking about. They know how to deal with a broader set of characters, don't they? This isn't something new to them, they had already done it in the past and that too in a competent manner.In the end, I do realize I'm in the minority this time but I am being completely honest in here. It's got some great action alongside a definitive emotional depth that results in a nostalgia dependant pleasure trip that I reckon would be more than enough for the plurality of the audience to fall in love with it. Can't say the same for me though. Why? Well let's just say, I made a different set of expectations in my mind.", "A Trip Down Memory Lane we will love Forever": "For after 20 years of the First Live Action Spider-Man Movie and 2012 and 2017's Reboot, this brings an entirely New Generation Of Marvel Fans Who grew up Watching These Movies in the 2000's!", "The most anticipated movie by arachnid fans!": "A film that deceived the viewer for a greater good, although there were many real leaks, there is no doubt that the surprise was just as exciting as if he had not seen them, It is a movie that I would see over and over again, all the characters had an important role and it did not feel forced, it fulfilled all expectations that even the craziest theories were the most real and calling them fools, there is no doubt that the spiderverse is getting better and better, this is just the beginning.", "definitely the best of the three": "Fortunately not too much time for all the usual disney/marvel 'comedy' which is so annoying.. this movie gets a bit more serious in the final two thirds and benefits from this enormouslyTobey Maguire who is my least favourite Spider-Man did great in this I thought, he did not do all the silly mannerisms and did a more subtle and authentic performance whereas Andrew Garfield who is my favourite Spider-Man was lost here and acted totally differently to how he did in the two Amazing Spider-Man moviesWillem Dafoe was absolutely brilliant.. finally we get what Spider-Man 1 should have been which is the green goblin without the silly helmet since Defoe facially is the green goblin. Dafoe acted like he had just come off of shooting Spider-Man 1... straight into the same character. Amazing. Really impressiveWhat I realized in this one though was that Zendaya really held these movies together, without her the three movies are a bit messy really. She was the glue that held them together.", "Truly AMAZING Spider-men": "This was amazing, and bringing back all of the true characters by bringing back the original stars made it that much better! Peter one, two, and three rocked it!", "Brings memory of great previous Spiderman(s)": "The best Spiderman movie ever.If you never watch the previous Spiderman movies before, please watch the SPIDERMAN (2002), SPIDERMAN 2 and SPIDERMAN 3; and the AMAZING SPIDERMAN (2014) and Amazing Spiderman 2.

The special effects and action were also above par.Now for the negatives. I still have no idea why anyone would think trying to \"cure\" a bunch of villains who shouldn't even be in your dimension in the first place, is a good idea. Much less Peter, who's supposedly a genius. After he made this decision, I just stopped caring about anything that happened to him because it's pretty much his own fault for making a really bad decision and then sticking with it, despite having had hours of opportunities to do so with the click of a button. How many countless people did he sacrifice, just so a few villains from other dimensions could get \"cured\" and possibly (it's not even guaranteed) survive back in their own?The dialogue was also very hit and miss. Some lines just made me facepalm. Off the top of my head, two particularly bad ones: the three Peters cracking cringy web jokes right before the final fight, instead of you know, coming up with a plan, and the random completely out of place \"racism\" comment about there being no Black Spiderman said in the middle of a fight scene.", "Amazing ending to the trilogy!": "Spider-Man: No Way Home was so hyped that at some point I though this might be the second coming of jesus christ lmao. The movie was so hyped and people were really excited to see the film and it turned out pretty good (ofc it will because it has 3 spider-man's in it).To start with the good things as always let's praise the CGi work here I mean almost 95% of the marvel movies have great CGi and here it's also the same case the CGi looked great, the film was packed with a lot of action sequences, the colors were on point, the choreography was excellent.The story is simple and straight forward but it ignores the storyline in the 2nd half and focuses on the 3 spider-man's a lot I mean everyone knows who is spider-man but still dude is travelling here and there without having to worry about people and he's accused of being the person behind all the things happened in far from home. Also the villains don't add up that much into the film except greeb goblin others are just there and does nothing else it felt like marvel just added them so people won't ask them questions like 'where are the rest of the villains?' also this same case goes for andrew and tobey's spider-man having less screen time and dialogues but still they did their work in the film.Marvel could've make it a lot better film if they didn't focused too much on the multiverse and doctor strange but still it's a good movie I pretty much enjoyed it myself.", "Fun for kids": "This really should be categorized as a kid's film like Spy Kids. I've never been a Marvel fan, but I have to admit some of their movies were pretty good. My personal favorites are the Captain America and Guardians of the Galaxy series. What I like about Captain American movies is how they try to make them more \"believable,\" have some level of suspension of disbelief. It reminds me of Michael Keaton's Batman when it first came out.Now, Spiderman really wasn't one of my favorites because it sounded ridiculous. However, the first trilogy with Toby wasn't too bad, well the 3rd movie was just ludicrous. I never saw the one with Garfield nor the first 2 of this series. However, I decided to watch this one after reading the synopsis and I wanted to see some CGI magic in de-aging the older actors. I was not disappointed with this.But overall this movie proved the point why I chose not to watch the rest of this series along to why I avoid most Marvel movies. Ironman 1 was alright, 2 was actually far more entertaining but what I liked about 1 again is how they try to make it somewhat believable in realism. By the time we get to 3 it was just a joke and in the multiverse and this \"nano\" tech suit, I just turned it off.I'm getting to my point. So this is suppose to be Spiderman, yet he has an Ironman nano suit now? I mean, how stupid is that? Yeah, I know they had some plot element that lead to it, but all this does for \"good writing\" is watering it down to cliches. It is unimaginative, uncreative, and just copy copy copy. I mean, same thing happened in Transformers when Megatron turned into another nano-tech. Remember how awesome it was in the 1st Transformers when Optimus Prime transformed and we watched all the gears and mechanical components move? Same thing with Ironman 1?Nano-tech is not awesome, it is CHEAP CGI, and furthermore it is an insult to intelligence. Nano is a measurement, 1 billionths of a meter. You can't actually see it. In these movies, you can clearly see large lego blocks. That's not even nano. The only sci-fi that did nano correctly is Star Trek Voyager, nano is microscopic. Borgs inject nanobots into people's bloodstream to alter them on a cellular level.Anyways, plot and storywise, this is really a kiddy film. It is fun for kids, but their target audience is adults so I can't give more than a 4 out of 10.", "The Legend Peter Parker Tobey Maguire returns!!": "This move is not great but what made it cool was seeing the original Spiderman return, the whole plot was actually pretty bad and their was barely any action and again the kid who plays peter 3, is just not good and i was surprised how bad Zendaya and the bestfriend did in acting in this movie. In the first two they were good in this one it was just not great. It has good actors but just wasn't great. Glad to see returning roles but just bring back Tobey Maguire again he is the true Spiderman.", "Now in my top 5 of favorite trilogies": "I'm a sucker for trilogies that succeed and I think it's really hard to create a cohesive trilogy. The third movie might be the hardest to make since it has to be a good sequel to the second movie but also has to go back to the first movie to wrap things up. It's amazing enough that this trilogy does this very well, most third movies in trilogies don't really satisfy. But what is extraordinary about this movie is that it not only wrap the story up perfectly, it also adds extra depth and closure to the other (unfinished) Spider-Man series. It even expands the MCU without losing it's focus on what is important here: Spider-Man becoming Spider-Man. Peter Parker has now grown up. Can't wait to see the new trilogy where he struggles with all-day your adult life and needs to juggle his responsibilities. But wherever that will take it, this trilogy succeeded very well and it's here to stay. Props!", "One of the best experiences in its genre. A masterclass in exceeding expectations.": "This movie is in all honestly peak MCU. As a stand-alone story I think it has more merit than Infinity War or Endgame.This film finds a way to bring back five previous villains, Tobey, and Andrew (not to mention a cameo from Matt Murdock) while having it all make sense and giving everyone some time to shine and redeem themselves.This is also Tom's best performance. He really sells the heartbreaking scenes. I was holding back tears both times I saw Aunt May's death in the theater.The movie also just has beautiful cinematography and action. The Strange fight scene in particular was wonderful to watch (and better than most of the Multiverse of Madness fights).I could just go on and on about this movie. Making Goblin the main villain, allowing Andrew and Doc Ock to have great redemption moments, Tobey and Ock reuniting, all amazing choices.My biggest gripes with the movie would be not giving Lizard and Sandman some screen time with their actors and Venom's credits scene feeling very pointless and misleading coming off of Let There Be Carnage.Regardless this may be my favorite MCU movie ever. A master class example in exceeding audience expectations.", "The last time I enjoyed these so much was when I saw DarkKnight": "I was engrossed right from the start, and I was engaged every second. It's filled with adventure, friendship, teamwork, love, empathy, and brotherhood.People in the cinema cheered multiple times when key characters appeared and when a hint of what Spiderman's future holds emerged. I thoroughly enjoyed it! Peter Parker (Holland, owning the role) is revealed to the world as Spider-Man, destroying his life and those of those in close proximity. He implores Dr. Strange (Cumberbatch, compelling) to use his magic to help. And there is an attempt. I think this is better than the end game. I have enjoyed it like I was enjoyed in Dark Knight really super JOB.", "Stick to a good story...": "Too many parallel universes and characters from different Spider-Man movies interfering with each other. The outcome is a very messy plot relying on way to many CGI effects making the visuals truly boring to look it... what happened to the truly great story with characters you cared for? Everything worth doing is not necessarily worth overdoing...", "I don't go around advertising it...": "Here's The 4K Lowedown on Spider-Man: No Way Home (PG-13 - 2021 4K)\nGenre: Fantasy/ComicMy Score: 9.2\nCast=10 Acting=8 Plot=7 Ending=10 Story=9\nImagine=10 Pace=9 CGI=10 Comic=9 Humor=104K: 9.2\nHDR: 10 Audio=9 Bass=8 Bright=10 Speech=9With his identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange for help.

And watching this was just amazing! It was emotional, magical and nostalgic! 10 out of 10!", "My favorite of the Holland Spidey movies": "This movie was great. I loved seeing all of the Gillian's trying to work together, and I especially loved the spider men (specifically Andrew Garfield). This movie was funny and dramatic, with a surprisingly emotional ending. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes marvel movies. Also, we finally meet daredevil, which is awesome.", "BEST MARVEL MOVIE MADE TO DATE": "I mean this was just incredible. Whoever put this together shouldn't have to buy another drink or meal ever!!! So amazing. Even the little moments were so genuine and felt real and were so good and carried so much weight. So great 2000/10.", "Total rubbish": "This movie is like a vegetable soup - random things are put into a pot, but anlike the vegi soup - it doesn't taste good. There is everything but a good script and storyline.", "What a pleasant surprise.": "The plot wasn't what I had expected it to be. It was a pleasant surprise. At the end of \"Spiderman Far From Home\" where J. Jonah Jameson outs our friendly neighborhood web slinger I expected Spiderman's fight for survival until he clears his name. Instead we have a multi-universe issue where are a spell to erase peoples minds on his identity a rift develops causing villain's from other universes entering this world. It is so nice to see \"old friends again\". Enter two of \"the other\" Spiderman.They team up to handle the threat. Sadly we lose a beloved character through the melee. The reason why this wasn't rated higher can be found in my reviews of \"Spiderman Homecoming\" and \"Spiderman Far From Home.\"", "Good culmination": "Firstly, the film doesn't let you breath at all. You get thrown in to this film, quicker than Usain Bolt in the 100 metres, it almost makes you feel as though you've missed 30 minutes of the beginning.Don't fret however, you soon get caught up, and the thrill's just keep in coming.I don't want to spoil too much, but the nostalgic feeling and the rememebrance of Spiderman 3 and the cringe worthy Maguire dance, are soon forgotten.All come together to make a pretty satisfying film, with the prospect of many more and much more romance to collect along the way, for all you love birds.I don't see an end which adds to the anticipation of the next movie, enjoy, sit back and relax, well.....try...", "Great, but a little overrated.": "I really like the MCU movies, especially Guardians of the Galaxy and Spider Man. I loved Spider Man: Homecoming, and I also enjoyed Far from Home a lot too, but this one is actually probably the weakest for me. It could be because I don't remember the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield Spider Men all that well, but I still think even if I did I wouldn't have enjoyed the movie that much more. I feel like Doctor Strange was out of character a bit, but I don't want to give anyone too many spoilers. But yeah, this is probably the bottom of my list for Tom Holland Spider Man movies, but still a solid, fun time.", "Yes! And No...": "This movie tries to be ambitious along two very diferent dimensions. And succeeds wildly on the one, fails wildly on on the other.OK, so the obvious dimension is that playing with and tying together the five previous Spiderman movies (with even a hint of Into the Spiderverse and Miles Morales). This was done astonishingly well, and it's unsurprising that the fans loved and continue to love it. Nothing more needs to be said on this score.The less obvious dimension is the on-going attempt by the younger generation to redefine morality by pretending that hard choices simply don't exist, that every moral dilemma is solvable just by wishing it to be so. This is not morality, this is cowardice. And so we have in this movie the happy idea that we can reform the villains. Yes, this is a beautiful dream; but it relies on magic. It is not applicable to the real world.Am I being silly here? I don't think so. If there's anything we should have learned from the past 300 years or so, it's that public morality (ie the morality of public spaces, the stories that get the most publicity) becomes the morality of a civilization.The morality of virtus became the morality of Christianity (for better or worse, as in Genealogy of Morals). What we now have replacing Christianity is something that pretends to be, and claims to be, deeper and richer, but is in fact grounded in the individual never having to feel bad. In this new morality there are two primary commandments\nyou're allowed to do whatever you want (as long as you know the correct words to justify it...) Be lazy, become a junkie, abandon your kids, leave your husband; they're all fine just so long as you present them in the right way. (Find a movie in which your situation happens, and study its lingo.)you should never have to make an uncomfortable choice. If magic is not available to solve your particular moral dilemma, find someone to blame for this magic not being available and shift the moral burden onto them.Those of us who have been around long enough thought that we'd hit some sort of end point of morality with the 70s or 80s. Sure, a public acceptance of a certain degree of grossness, but ultimately still grounded in people understanding personal responsibility and the nature of choices. I don't think any of us expected things to wriggle out so wildly from that ground understanding to this new world where choices should not have to exist, and if they do, it's someone else's fault. Fukuyama was too early - we have not reached the end of history, because this morality is something truly new, and it seems unlikely to me that it is capable of sustaining civilization. (And on the way, I suspect it will result in atrocity unlike anything ever seen before. Nothing is as heartless as someone infuriated that *you* are the cause of their moral qualms...)", "The best character development ever in a movie. MUST READ": "I never rate any marvel movies before because I don't really care about it after watching it (P. S i watch all MCU phase 3 including the series).But i thought to myself it would be a crime to not rate this movie. My favourite marvel movies before this was CA:CW and i rate it myself no more than 8. I thought the hype on this wouldn't be justified because some of marvel movies was over hyped IMO and yet this one got the hype justified. I rarely gave 9 to any movies i ever watch, but this one definitely deserve it IMO.I don't really care about the returning character because tom holland's Peter character development in this movie hooked me up and took all my excitement and attentions so it makes the fan service looks like normal thing. In the early part to mid part of the movies you'll get super annoyed with tom and i even think that this man is the worst avenger (indeed he is) but from that fall from the annoying things he did, he got punished really well and it start to build his true hero persona and i really love the ending which he let alone his friends and choose to stay them away from his dangerous life so he can focus on being superhero and THIS WAS MISSING FROM ANY MCU MOVIES where superheroes didn't feel like heroes at all. In this movie i've finally able to feels tom's spiderman(so far he's the only one) as a true hero which was the same feels as i got for tobey's spiderman.TLDR:\nSo yeah, this deserve my 9. Not because the returning characters but because the beautiful character development.", "Watch it if you're a true Spiderman fan": "I really thought bringing previous Spiderman will ruin this film...but it didn't....it really works...the film was just amazing... for the first time we were able to see the darker version of Holland's Spiderman ...holland did a great job again as Spiderman and also as an actor.... there are some minus in this film but I can't point out them cause all of them were overshadowed by the direction, screenplay, action sequences, performances,fan service and of course musical score... this film really deserves to be the biggest blockbuster of this year...you must watch this awesome Spidey venture if Ur an true Spiderman films lover.", "MOSTLY LIVES UP TO THE HYPE": "SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*I haven't seen Tobey Maguite's Spider-Man films (I think I saw 1 but I don't remember)*I haven't seen Netflix 's DareDevil*It's been a while since I saw Garfield's Spider-Man films but I remember loving them, especially 2.With a surprisingly boring start, \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" isn't my favorite among Holland's films. However, the 2nd and 3rd act brought back the charm, action and laughs I saw and felt in \"Homecoming\" & \"Far From Home.\" It's main selling point is the Multiverse and it mostly lives up the hype while the film's best part is its heartbreaking ending. As for major flaws, Garfield's Peter makes jokes that are a bit out of character (more in line with the MCU, not the Mark Webb films) and the way the other Peters were brought in annihilates Doctor Strange's (barely in the movie) training from his first solo film. Lastly, there's surprisingly little amount of action sequences in NWH.", "My story with Spiderman": "I believe everyone has their own stories and memories about Spiderman. Here's mine. Spiderman (2002) was the first ever superhero film I've ever watched. I've watched the movie countless of time. I've even bought a Spider suit and I was just 5 years old at that time. After almost 20 years and 24 years old now, I've finally seen the best Spiderman movie that ever made.To some people it might just be an ordinary Marvel's movie but to us, it's more than that.I watched this movie on the 15th December, the day it released in Malaysia. I've got no expectations although I've seen a lot of rumours everywhere but Marvel dealt with it pretty good. Just hire someone to make a fake clip about the film and the fans is gonna think the rumors is probably fake. Honestly, it's also a pretty good strategy by Marvel as the rumors not only hype up the movie but also make people wanted to watch the film just to confirm whether the rumors is true or not.Back to the movie, the beginning was fine until 40-50 minutes and I've even forgotten about the rumors while watching the movie until Ned started to make a portal. I didn't expect anything and probably think they're gonna find Tom using that but noooo. It reveals a Spider man with a different suit and then someone in the cinema suddenly started shouting. I was like why?? Is Andrew and Tobey going to appears now? Then the spiderman ran towards the portal and jump in. Still I think it could probably be Tom from other dimension or just some stunt actor. It was until that Spiderman revealed his face. Voilaaaa it's ANDREW GARFIELD!!!! Everyone in the cinema went crazy and just shouting like we've just won World Cup. It was then the tears from my left eyes started falling. It was at that time I saw hope. And then of course there's only Andrew in it and I've seen a rumors saying only Andrew going to be in it so I kept my expectations low. Then Ned started to create another portal. Everyone in the cinema was on their seats. Is it Tobey? Is it Tobey? Then voila!!! TOBEY MAGUIRE!!!!!! The crowd in the cinema just went crazy and it felt like an earthquake!!! At this moment the tears from my right eyes just fell. It sure is a happy tears \ud83d\ude2d. I was so happy that all Spiderman is in the movie.Not only the fans voice was heard but the meme that we've seen all over social medias was in it too. It's like dream comes true for all Spiderman fans out there and it's sooooo freaking satisfying. Seeing 3 Spider-Man swings together was the coolest scene in the entire movie and this movie just changed the way people looked at Andrew Garfield's Spiderman. I'm just glad he managed to save MJ in this universe as he failed to save his Gwen in his universe. I cried on this scene too after looking at Andrew's face who managed to saved MJ. So glad he did it.Not only that, the reference the movie used is all related to the past Spiderman movies which is not part of Marvel. I know a lot of people hated Sony due to the rights they owned but this time Sony did make a great decision and I bet it will be the best decision Sony ever made because this movie is definitely going down in the history as the best Spiderman movie ever made.Other than that, there is some lacking in terms of the plot but having Tobey, Andrew and Tom in the same movie is going to make all the fans out there forgets about the flaws. All the fans ever wanted is for their voice to be heard and this is enough because the fans will felt like they are part of it. So yeahhh D *cough* C listen to your fans out there.Well other than that, watching this film also reminds me of my good childhood memories because 5 years after the first Spider-Man movie was released, my parents broke out and ever since then, I was in depression until now. Watching this movie reminds me how happy and different I was at that time as I was always happy before everything just broke down into pieces. So yeahh, to me this is not just some movie but a key that unlock back my happiest memories.Thank you Marvel, Sony and the entire production crew for making this movie happened. And this is why, this will be one of the best Marvel's film ever.", "Passed My Expectations": "This movie was PHENOMENAL!! I've never expected anymore from a movie than I did for this one, and yet it actually turned out to be 10 times better than I had hoped. Willem Defoe was incredible as usual. Green Goblin in this movie is absolutely insane. And though it was the same Goblin as in the first Spider-Man, it seems like the one in this one is much stronger, crazier, and even has an enormous fight scene with Spider-Man. This movie absolutely raced passed my expectations and turned out to making it in my top 10 favorite movies of all time. With all the original bad guys and Spider-Men in one place, I couldn't ask for a better ending to the \"Home\" franchise.", "Movie was great, but the venom stuff is meh": "The movie was overall really, really good I would say 8.5-9. There was a few issues but nothing major, it's pure fan service enjoyment and one of the best marvel movies period.Only issue I had was with Venom, what was the point of hyping up hardy being in the mcu just to take him back instantly? If you were going to do that you may as well have just of sent a piece of symbiote instead of hardy himself at the end of the Venom 2 credits. Disappointing but, whatever.", "This is for Tobey.": "The movie was great but it earned the 10 /10 rating for bringing back Tobey Maguire the original and the best of them all........................................................", "Don't misjudge it.": "When i left the movie theater i was thrilled, I loved what i saw and watched, Spider man has been always my marve's favorite superhero. But when i was watching it, there were many bad and poorly written things, Too easy solution for big problems, the \"Evil\" part was the worst thing in the movie. The drama and the comedy were more blanced than any other marvel's movies, The movie is great because it remindes us with our memories with the beloved characters.It wasn't bad but not great ot perfect, It's just very emotional.", "ABSOLUTELY AMAZING": "I can't think of anything more simple to say that this is the best marvel movie and what a phenomenal trio! I couldn't be happier with how the movie ended up being! The fight scenes were sick as can be, everyone's performances were stunning. Seeing all three of the Peters just was iconic and I cannot wait for the next chapters because this is perfection! #OscarWorthy. ITS A MUST SEE!", "It's Like A Spider-Man Fanfic Come To Life!": "When I was younger I loved the two Spider-Man Tobey and Andrew and wanted them to return, I thought of it as a dream but then this came out, I'm so happy to see all my favorite villains from the past come back, Tom Holland is a good Spider-Man but nothing beats Andrew and Tobey.", "#SpiderManNoWayHome is the greatest movie of all-time.": "To be very honest, didn't enjoy Endgame this much. The times I screamed, cheered while watching this movie clearly exceeds all previous ones\nCombined. In short, BEST \"solo' SPIDERMAN\nMOVIE.", "Great but not perfect.": "Great movie overall.My 4 complaints that made this 5/10.1. Too many talking scenes.2. Too much explaining everything.3. No Sinister 6, Villainous Five maybe?4. Tobey Maguire didn't want to return, it shows in his performance.5. End credits removes Venom from MCU.Other than that I enjoyed it very much.", "You should be embarrassed if you think this is a 10": "But it was a lot of fun! You find yourself sick of Tom Hollands peter parker and desperate to see more of the previous guys but you just dont get it, the villians were also very poorly utilized, spending any time away from spiderman, meant we had no idea what they were up to. Also aunt May saying the line was such barf. The older spider men create that nostalgic feeling and get you hyped for the final battle, but the battle falls flat and favors the random sidekick formula as marvel always does. For me th most difficult thing was seeing serious actors playing serious villans in this marvel universe. Something about it just didnt work. The nostalgia made for a great ride but the storyline of the MCU spidey was far too thin to support anything but that. Zendaya seems like a nice gal, but her acting across from Tom is flatter than the first soda ever made would be if it were still in a cup today. Number one flaw is the CGI is horrendous. For the leading user of CGI the MCU is embarassingly bad at making things not look like cartoons. They get an 8 for milking nostalgia. Otherwise the storyline is really just awful and unbelievable for a Spider-Man flick.", "Sometimes Marvel hits the point.": "Gripping movie throughout. Realistically establishes the content despite fantasy edge. This really grasp the viewer's attention and makes him seated to it. I'm not a marvel fan, haven't seen all franchise of different superheroes. But I have gone through some of it like Avengers. And I say Marvel do sometimes hits the point. The point of being a masterpiece.I have not seen all spiderman franchise but still understood well about the entire storyline. Very well built. SNWH is about spiderman adventure in multiverse existence and all the knitty-gritty edges with it. Excellent effects and character developement. Though content wise it is similar to Spiderverse but still is different in the case of number of villains. Summing up both the movies are excellent though slightly different.Throughout the movie I was impressed by one thing -\nThe mistakes, an immatured minds makes and then learning from the mistakes, gradually makes you matured wise and peaceful. A wondefully established reality in this comic story.", "Nostalgia at its peak.": "I can't believe what my eyes just saw. It was by far the most ambitious work commitment by MCU. The movie surely lived up to its hype. Also the action sequence were. Amazing.", "Almost redeems the Amazing Spider-Man": "An absolute blast of IP-powered plotting surprises, thematic strength, and unabashed fan service, and as a fan, I felt very... serviced...? It's not perfect (unimaginative action visuals, over-dependence on self-conscious jokes), but I did cry twice. I mean, they wanted me to cry like 10 or 15 times, but still...two times is pretty remarkable.", "Triple Vision": "All the spidermans ?!?! Though the whole 'multi-verse' concept is sorta soap-opera creative writing, it's hard not to love all the characters that join in the film. Holland makes a great lead.", "Fan service done right!": "I've always been a Spider-Man fan and boy did they bid farewell in the movie. It's a much watch in the cinemas coz the environment was electric and movie full of comedy scenes.", "Wow a total mess of a plot disguised by fanservice and cute banter": "When I walked out of the movie theater I felt pretty good about the movie. I was never bored while watching it and the plot seemed interesting enough. The only moment I had an issue with was when Peter suddenly went into a blinding murderous rage when green goblin showed up but suddenly calmed down and decided not to stab him through with the glider. From the point where Aunt May dies to the end of the movie, we barely get glimpses of how Peter Parker is feeling. He is seen having playful banter with the other spidermen and barely seems angry even right after aunt may dies. He seems more sad then angry even as the other peter parkers tell him not to go murder people. It was such a jarring tonal shift that it took me out of the movie when Peter started beating up on Green Goblin (which doesnt even make sense because green goblin was far stronger than him in the earlier scene and nothing has changed).After a bit more thinking about the movie, I realized that so much of this movie is flawed. I will say, the action is good, the acting is good (andrew garfield plays a better spiderman than both tom holland and tobey maguire), and the film is shot well however the film severely lacks quality in the writing department.The whole movie happens because of ridiculously dumb decisions made by both peter parker and dr strange. The spell that is used is not explained nearly enough to have the end solution (everyone forgetting peter parker) make any logical sense. In the scene where tom holland was given that ultimatum, I felt more confused by the reasoning than moved by the sacrifice he was making. Peter tries to \"save\" these villains but he doesn't even attempt to get to know these villain's stories. Aunt may tells him its his responsibility to save these people because they are lost or at least norman is but Peter only realizes he needs to be saving these people because he is sending them to die, but Sandman doesn't even die and neither does the lizard. Sure the lizard is better off cured, but peter didnt talk to him enough to even understand why.This contrived plot line takes up a fair bit of the movie before norman goes evil and tells the other villains that they dont need to be cured and suddenly the lizard leaps out of the car like its planned, doc oc just runs off into the night after getting shocked a bit and sandman flees just for kicks while spiderman fights green goblin.And then aunt may dies and its sad and she basically gives the great power great responsibility line and tells peter its his duty to save those people.And then hes sad, the other spidermen show up, they work on cures for everyone and then the have the final fight.This plot just did not work for me at all.", "Just fantastic!": "Throughout the story, there are tears, laughter, and heart-wrenching delight on the verge of exploding. Fans of Spider-Man will not be disappointed. Because this is possibly the most complete Spider-Man I've ever seen.We believe that Tom Holland's Spider-Man is our least favorite. Peter seemed to be quite young to us. In comparison to others, it appears like his existence revolves solely around his pals. It's either about school, MJ, or being an avenger's enthusiast. We rarely see the gravity of his bravery.We adore Marvel's take on Spider-Man as a coming-of-age story, with Tony pushing, nurturing, and seeing Spidey as a child. However, we must admit that we are looking forward to the day when this Spider-Man matures. And deserving of the title of superhero, as well as a remark like \"Tremendous power comes with great responsibility.\" It's finally here, and the day has arrived.One of our favorite aspects of this installment is seeing Peter's growth. Following the previous section, I'm still a small child with no intellect. Create general mayhem (this part is basically the same, lol), but in this sector he learnt, matured, and was brave, willing to sacrifice like a superhero. We can see that he is ready to step up and work as a team with his seniors. Tony's pusher is no longer.We get to experience Tom Holland's intense temperament in this part, and it has to be said that his emotive moments, his sorrowful, anger-filled eyes, and his comprehension were plain and strong. Clearly, this was not the same Spider-Man. It's extremely good (albeit it's unlikely to win an Oscar, as Tom claims, hehe).The plot's story, which we may not be able to play sufficiently Everything appeared to rush in and then linger for a few moments. As a result, the tone and substance of the plot may be hazy. Including the action moments, which aren't particularly entertaining or exciting. As a result, this section is a little hazy for us. (We believe the action scenes are the best.) There will be a lot more. After the conflict is ended, the phrase 'Is that so?' enters my mind briefly.)In this part, the teaser's universe does not play a prominent role. It's more of a prequel to Spidey before we get into the main plot of Doctor Strange 2, which we're really excited about. Who thought of Spider-Man as a way to introduce Doctor Strange? Because it's Spider-Man, it knows how to play with the multiverse. Very astute. It's possible to play like this. Both the tale and the hearts of the people.The major reason to watch No Way Home is because of its excellent service. He knows what viewers like us want to see since he's a filmmaker. Wearing it can be considered to be limitless. I'm glad I got to see this at least once in my life. Because it is brimming with the sensation of being really Spider-Man. The film is interesting to movie aficionados because it pays attention to little things. And you transmit it effectively; it's stunning, and we believe this emotion will linger in our minds for a long time.", "Over rated": "The best thing about this Spider-Man movie is when Maguire comes back. He was and always will be the best Spider-Man.Yes it great seeing the three of them together but the films is overstated, bloated and not funny at all. Marvel once again turn what could have a been a good film into a comedy and one that isn't very funny.Holland is a good Spider-Man but he's been let down by being a support character in the marvel universe. It's very telling that it's even acknowledged in the film itself.", "Spectacularly Amazing!": "Spider-Man, No Way Home, is amazingly spectacular in every way. It is excellent as both a continuation of the current series, and a marvelous tip of the hat to the previous cinematic renditions. It serves as its own movie while also offering enough fan-service for the die-hard Spidey fans (like me!).We pick up immediately after Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and MJ (Zendaya) come face-to-face with the consequences of Far from Home. In case the MCU fans have forgotten, J. Jonah Jameson (JK Simmons) crossed into the present world of Spider-Man. More like a political commentator with his own online show, he rails against both Peter Parker and Spider-Man. They are one and the same.Not only is Peter's life upended, but also MJ, Ned (Jacob Batalan), and Aunt May's (Marissa Tormei) lives are turned upside-down. Between the press, the police, and the pressure, they go into hiding with Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau).The pressure mounts so much that Peter seeks out the help of Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). Maybe he can make everyone forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Peter wants to change the spell a bit, and keeps talking, distracting Strange and the spell goes wrong. The trailers tell the rest as enemies from previous Spider-Man renditions enter into his world. Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina), Norman Osburne (Willem Dafoe) and Max Dillon (Jamie Fox) come at Peter with a vengeance - but are just as confused as he is.Dr. Strange needs to send them back to their original universes where they face certain death. Peter doesn't want that and seeks to help them as previous Spider-Mans have done, but failed. This leads to a well-structured and well-paced plot that develops the characters and presents plot turns with real potential consequences. In the end, Peter Parker grows up and becomes responsible - bearing the brunt of those consequences.Tom Holland gives his best performance, dealing with loss, pain, and conflict with Dr. Strange. Also, Zendaya grew on me here, despite her emo portrayal of MJ. Her character, too, grows up and she has great chemistry with Holland. Ned, too, also grows as a character, and learns how to deal with power and responsibility as well.Now for the spoilers - so don't read beyond here if you don't want them. However, anyone familiar with the plots, and the nostalgia, can probably guess what will happen. Yes, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield reprise their Spider-Man roles and work together to defeat their cross-universe adversaries. They have to work as a team, and they learn about each other's disappointments, regrets and losses. One of the best scenes is when Garfield (God help me, I was glad to see him return) and Holland marvel at Maguire's webbing produced naturally in his own body.Oh - and Charlie Cox does reprise his role as Matt Murdock who is Peter's lawyer. The blind lawyer even has a chance to display his uncanny abilities in the brief scene!Back to Spider-Man (or rather Spider-Men), they also face more enemies that suggested in the trailers: Flint Marko, the Sandman, returns, as well as Curt Connors, the Lizard (but thankfully no Topher Grace as Eddie Brock). Another great aspect was that the villains have their own plot twists that are not easily predictable.Moreover, the plot does justice in fan-service by redeeming mistakes in the original Raimi trilogy and the awful reboot with Garfield.Anyone who is a die-hard Spider-Man fan like me will love this - and might even shed some tears. This is a movie that still has me pumped even an hour after it was over. It will definitely be seen again!", "Nearly 20 years in the making": "A fantastic story line that brings every spider franchise in line and re-opens each universe for future filmsA fantastic cast with brilliant Easter eggs for marvel and Sony to use. Everything ties together perfectly.", "Just awesome": "The build up to this movie pver the whole Spider-Man movies is just awesome and its so cool to see it all come together in an amaizing movie 10 out of 10.", "What was the point?": "This film was a fan-service. That is it.There is no real purpose for it in the MCU. The music lackluster. Tobey & Andrew were wasted. Benedict was the the only time we were not wanting to leave.You wont miss much if you watch it at home.", "I'll never get over this movie": "It's been 5 days since I saw this and I still can't find words to describe what I saw ... I'll just thank God for being alive to see this. Best spiderman movie ever ... so far.P. S.... A. G. You are amazing and you are the best for me.I love you guys......", "MARVEL's homerun of Spiderman": "No Way Home is probably the most anticipated movie of 2021. And amidst the pandemic, people are flocking theatres and although spoilers are everywhere, the movie is buzzing for right reasons. Sony has finally taken the MARVEL route, combined it perfectly with the nostalgia and delivered probably the greatest movie in Spiderman history.Whatever I could reveal about the plot is pretty much already in the trailer and anything else would be a spoiler. The movie is equally serious and goofy and manages to maintain the Spiderman charm throughout. The action sequences are brilliant, humour is thoroughly enjoyable and the visual effects take you for a ride (especially the ones that involve Dr Strange).It is a very hard task to balance so many characters of high importance in one movie. But Jon Watts successfully manages so many key characters and actors. The humour element added to the old Spiderman villains helps as well. I don't wanna go about how each individual has performed as I could go on and on.Spiderman No Way Home strikes perfect balance with the new age MARVEL universe fans and the old Spiderman franchise fans and leaves everyone quite 'spell'bound.", "Best of the Tom Holland ones": "I enjoyed this film much better than the other two Tom Holland films . It was good to see Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield in Spider Man again . The multiple villains including Green Goblin. Otto Octavious, Sandman and the Lizard were great. The Dr Strange character was well played by Benedict Cumberbatch. The film had some good action scenes .", "Loved every minutes of this film": "I'm glad they bought both the Spider-Man to this movie (Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield). It was awesome when they came to scene. And after the climax I just felt emotional for a bit. When they forgets everything and reform the world. It was a nice scene...", "Poor writing but great effects": "I was really looking forward to the new Spider-Man but was very disappointed. Firstly, the effects are great and there are some funny one liners, but it stops there. Basically, Spider-Man using his teen brain decides he knows best, creates a rip in the multiverse so that he and his friends can go to college. In doing so kills his closest relative and likely thousands of innocent bystanders. So with such awful writing the only audience that would get anything from this movie would be the same young teens that are probably sitting there going at least his friend got into college at the end. Hopefully this type of teen \"movie\" is not the new trend for Marvel movies.", "Unexpected!": "You literally didn't expect that 3 spiderman shown in this movie. And I don't understand why Dr Strange do the wrong spell because he kkow how to control it according to movie he have done this many time.", "The best spiderman move ever": "It was the best Spiderman movie ever. Period. There was everything to love here. I enjoyed every bit of it. 10/10 would recommend. I will be rewatching this movie quite a bit. A theater experience to remember.", "Spider-Man: Done Right": "I have so much to say about this movie. Above all else, I am most glad that Spider-Man was done right this movie. I really hope this puts an end to the \"MCU Spider-Man\". After watching twice in cinema, the movie still feels like a dream. Still cannot believe they really did it. Incredible work by MCU to pull this off. This movie will rank among the best Spider-Man movies along with Spider-Man 2 and Into the SpiderVerse.Spider-Man finally gets his Uncle Ben moment where he understands the responsibility that comes with the power. Still weird though that there is no mention of Uncle Ben. I really wished they had done Aunt May better in the last two movies, instead of just sexualizing her. For the first time in the franchise, Spider-Man felt like Spider-Man: a broke teenager for whom things always end baldy while he keeps struggling to manage his two lives.Tom Holland has been brilliant in the last two movies and didn't disappoint in this one either. Andrew Garfield is an incredible actor and he showed that again in this movie. I was just glad they were able to get Tobey Maguire back for the movie. For someone who has been out of movies for so long, Tobey Maguire was never off the mark.Props to John Watts the way he handled this movie. Giving Willem Dafoe the lead villain role was a masterstroke that worked well. He was downright scary as Green Goblin. Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man getting teary eyed when he mentioned Gwen and then the way he saved MJ, making sure he didn't make the same mistake, was just perfect. Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man stopping Tom Holland's Spider-Man from killing the Goblin was a great throwback too. There was something for all the fans and everything for Spider-Man fans.For me this movie was an achievement above End Game. They really did manage to return almost every main character from all Spider-Man movies for this one and managed it perfectly. And not only that, fixed the flaws with the previous movies making this the definitive version of Spider-Man.", "THANK YOU TOM, ANDREW, TOBEY!": "I remember my childhood with Tobey.I remember my teenager days with Andrew. Now with Tom i feel all of them. Whatever i write here doesn't matter. I can't explain with words my feelings. It's soo deep. Wish i could hug all of them. Even doc oc. All of them soo great.

Everything is perfect every character is perfect and dedicated to his role.", "The Amazing Rating Men": "How that movie got to 8/10 is a deep mystery.Painfully predictable.Unreliable story.Lengthy boring scenes.Granted, that movie qualifies for the most suspicious high rating ever.", "Prefect bookend for a new beginning": "Prefect bookend for a new beginning. Movie had plenty of character surprise and the best development of a Peter Parker and who is than we've ever had.", "My Favorite Spider-Man Movie": "This movie is a true masterpiece, from start to finish.In the beginning we can see the direct continuation of Spiderman: Far From Home, where the identity of Peter is revealed by Mysterio, the antagonist of the previous film.In this film the MCU's Spiderman has a better development during the story, compared to the previous films.This movie, in my opinion, has the best villain of all the Spiderman movies: The Green Goblin. Played by the great Willem Dafoe, who gives us a magnificent performance and unforgettable fights.Alfred Molina's Doc Ock was also a great villain, and had one of the best action scenes in superhero movies.I really enjoyed watching the movie :)", "OUTSTANDING": "Best Spiderman movie i saw for the series, credit goes to Marvel and to the Author of the movie connecting all previous movies and bringing all Spider Men and Velons all together to honor them in another movie blockbuster like this one, i watched it 2 times in theater, Gooo Spidy.", "woo!!!!! *claps hands*": "Never have i've been to a movie where so many people screaming woo. And clapping their hands at scenes. This is such a fan service movie that reconciles all the previous spiderman movies. If you enjoyed any of the other spidy movies, this is a must watch because its the icing on the cake.", "The absolute best": "I have no idea how they managed to make a movie that competes with endgame in only 2 years, marvel still somehow can make incredible movies. This is definitely the funniest entry, but it's also the saddest entry and they blend both so well together. This is a must watch. Now spoilers ahead do not keep reading if you haven't seen it.In the past, spiderman movies with too many villains just hasn't worked, but in this one it works because each of the villains was developed in the previous spiderman movies. Also, each character has a funny moment and has some depth to them, they aren't just punching bags for spiderman. Another thing is Andrew Garfield and Toby maguire Spider-Man's also don't just feel like fan service, they also have some depth. Don't get me wrong though, you will be grinning at every reference to other spiderman movies and all the interactions between the characters. Even if you didn't watch the previous spiderman movies, you will probably enjoy it, but I would highly reccomend watching all the previous spiderman movies.", "Pure fan service and Nostalgia!": "As a child growing up watching Toby's Spiderman movies and as a teen when watching the Amazing Spiderman movies, this movie just hits nostalgia at all points. As trailers indicated, Peter Parker's spell with Doctor Strange goes awry when he tries to interfere with it after he's been outed. Unlike homecoming, thankfully they didn't make Peter as Strange's apprentice. It is more of a Spiderman movie than a Doctor Strange movie. The appearance of previous Spiderman movie characters gives much depth to the story and all the actors especially Dafoe did an incredible job. Of course, the open secret of the appearance of Spidermen is what makes it like an event like Infinity war and Endgame. The writers handled both characters very well and did them justice by having them in the extended cameo. The mid and post-credits scene are perhaps one of the most interesting ones in MCU. The movie's main drawback is its plot. Don't get me wrong, it was just average and unoriginal, partly inspired from Spider-man: into the Spiderverse movie but saved by engaging screenplay and amazing presence of actors. On the endnote, just go watch it in theatres when you still have the chance. It's been the event movie, we all waited since the starting of the pandemic.", "Mid": "Plot didn't make any sense. There's no point in seeing the movie. Ffffffffff the meet going to be a long time ago and I was like 10 00 I was just thinking about.", "Cash grabbing nonsensical crap": "I really tried to watch this movie but marvel got really old. It's just the same crap over and over again. Superhero movies are getting old just like action movies got old in the 90s. It's just ridiculous watching these movies and I hope people will realize that soon.", "You're all grown up, dear boy. How are you?": "No Way Home was a cathartic festival. A pilgrimage back to childhood. It undid a lot of John Watts' previous follies, allowing Tom Holland's Spider-Man to experience tragedy, in all seriousness of the term. It took seven years and three films for Tom Holland to actually become Spider-Man. The only complaint I have with No Way Home is that it could have done away with its shallow jokes and could have comfortably gone on for another hour. In the process, giving us more of Goblin, and of course, the older Spider-Men. That apart, it was a true festival.", "Spiderman's 57 years old idea at its best cinematic form": "Here we see a beautiful picture, one that is as large as it's grounded; it's insanely fantastical yet is deeply intimate and close; dancing smoothly between the edges of the humorous and the sad and the charming and the personal and the existential. It jumps around as its central character from the smallest simplest gestures of a 17-year-old to the most dangerous threats to what constitutes reality itself, then lands into what this whole trilogy of franchises really is ... a tender coming of age story.Here we see a kid growing up, what makes him grow up, and why he needs to do so. This is an expertly externalized adorable contrast, similar to what is embedded into the origins of the character itself; the meeting of many, the young and youthful; the awkwardness of our old momentary school crushes and beginnings of romance; the flamboyant rage and the pinkish cravings to make sense of what's around and to embroid a sense of justice onto the world; then to be blessed/cursed with a true power to make a true palpable physically touchable difference, yet to experience the heaviness of the world and the impossibility of its rules, then only craving to escape back, but eventually to find out that growth is an eventuality, and that this young kid, as any young kid can be, is truly a hero, and that some of what constructs a hero are the clumsy journeys towards an honest confrontation with the self between its past and future. This is a picture that celebrates growth and is ever hopeful, despite its dread of loss, it necessitates it, making the statement that the would world continue to be, embracing the losses and deaths and the confrontations with the devils of the past as indeed a never-ending journey that has beauty and hope at its core. This is adulthood, and this movie speaks of that.This picture is beautiful and fun, heavy and dark, sad and heartbreaking. It pays homage to moments that we grew up with, it doesn't lean too heavily on the nostalgic but embraces it smoothly into its essence, it feels natural and true. Here is without a doubt, the best installment of this series, and one of the heaviest emotional culmination of any huge franchise; one that is made cleverly with passion and love that is abundant, and despite a few mishaps here and there, it is all magical.", "Fantastic third installment to the Tom Holland SpiderMan movies": "If you went into this movie expecting Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire to show up... well, I won't tell you anything because this is a SPOILER FREE review.I'm not just saying this as a Marvel fan, but I'm also saying this as a huge movie buff- Spiderman No Way Home was EASILY one of the best movies to have come out in 2021.Filled with laughs, action, and incredibly sad moments, No Way Home does not disappoint. The acting, the storyline, EVERYTHING was the perfect setting for a Marvel movie.I'm gonna keep this review short and just give everyone who is going to watch this movie a quick word of advice- watch BOTH end credits after the movie (you won't regret it).", "Spider-Men : No May home !": "The movie is pure Fan-service. Literally everything you can imagine (and probably not) is there and the Audience reactions in the Cinema was comparable to that in Avengers: endgame .It's not Perfect and there are many plot holes and continuity threads which would need to be cleared in the further marvel movies or shows .Best parst: Scenes with the three Spidermen- Really works amazingly and is a treat to every Fan.Worst parts: Scenes with the three Peter parkers. The chemistry just felt very fake and thir tones were just off , also may be its my fault that i didnt rewatch the tobey and Garfield films recently.Mid credits and end credits scenes are worth waiting For .", "The moment you've all been waiting for": "I can imagine my fans desperately wondering where is the SMNWH review.Wonder no more it is now here.Anyways...When I first saw the trailer I thought the movie was gonna be instant hash instantly. Since December I've been searching on YouTube Spiderman No Way Home sucks. I enjoyed every rant till this day.I must apologize. The movie was not instant hash. I was a decent film for its tier although its still undeserving of the records, hype and box office revenue.About: Peter aka MCU Peter wants to fix his problems so he goes to the Wizard and the multiverse opens up.Story: Stale, slow, timid.Production: cgi fest. Drawn out and a long movie with nothing fantastic to show. (No pun intended)Sountrack: It didn't make me want to get jiggy with it. (Bad slapstick joke.)Highlight: Nothing. It's sad that a multiverse movie was unable to have any highlights. Over 3 universes and no highlights. That's sad.Main Intelligence: 5Unworthiness level: 6. MCU Peter Parker \"girlfriend\" has always been questionable.Should you watch this? Meh. With so much hype and records this movie was lacklustering overrated. I knew it would. I'm not surprised that The jokes were immature and weak too.There is no doubt that This movie is great as a low tier movie and not as a major blockbuster. As a blockbuster it's weak and lacks maturity, groundness, evolution, and better storytelling. Let's not forget the horrible cgi and green screen.Seeing all the old villians and Spidermans did nothing for me. I just didn't care for their presence as much as I don't care for this great low tier movie. The villians were not all that great anyways. The hype could not fool me. For I am Mighty.For my imdb fans sake please watch this movie.", "A mess": "Gave this movie, which I was looking forward to, 50 minutes before finally turning it off. The story is a mess and stupid.

Love the movies with humor!I love that the movie respects the first original Spider-man cast: Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe. Great Actors!Great \"inside\" jokes/stories in this movie, so recommend watching the other Spider-Man series with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield to experience the best!", "Fun movie": "Really fun movie to watch with friends. Pretty good plot for a marvel movie with fun dialogue and action sequences. Overall ok movie but good for the mcu.", "Far from good: the franchise has lost its way": "First off, I just want to say how much I loved the first two Tom Holland Spiderman films. He's the quintessential Spiderman-innocent, bright, a bit cocky, relatable. The films were well-scripted and well-paced. However, with 'No Way Home', the franchise seems to have lost its way.Sure, it's an entertaining popcorn film, and Marvel fans will marvel at the clever way that several characters from prior films converge, but the bottom line is, there's too much happening, too many stories at once, too many clever twists, too much action, and not enough time to properly follow it all.It's almost as if the popularity of 'Into the Spiderverse' led executives to push for a way to replicate that in live-action. Unfortunately, 'Far from Home' is\ntoo clever for its own good, creating wild plot holes that it has to use magic to patch up, and throwing away awesome characters (and actors) on what are essentially bit roles.The best part of this particular iteration of Spiderman is the human quality, and while the jokes are all there, I found the relationship scenes to be laboured and often hokey. And the subtext of mental illness-that worked so incredibly well as a character study in 'Joker'-seems superficial and wrong here.In the end, as the old adage goes, 'keep it simple, stupid.' It was the simplicity of the story in 'Homecoming' that allowed room for the characters to breathe. 'Into the Spiderverse' was excellent, 10 out of 10, but it was a different animal. I hope the producers are able to get this franchise back on track, because the Holland-Zendaya chemistry is magic.", "Don't miss it...It's just simply WOW...": "What an extraordinary experience to see all the three best of the best spideis...and the storyline, direction, action sequence, cinematography just awesome \ud83d\udc4cI am so happy to see the Daredevil in MCU movie\ntoday in the theater.

It was a really pleasant surprise with our own Lawyer in the incredible scene in this movie.Plz plz plz bring back this character..full flege...and you will see how much popular it i\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5", "Lives up to the hype": "For those of us who grew up with the other Spider-Man movies, this was great. For those who haven't seen those, don't worry, it's easy enough to follow.", "People are blinded by emotions -- It could have been so much better": "This movie was extremely overhyped for the past year or so. It was made out to be the biggest Spider-Man movie yet, and it kind of is, regardless of the quality. It has several villains in it from past Spider-Man movies as well as cameos by the two past Spider-Men. It was clearly inspired by the AU storyline of Into the Spider-Verse, yet it doesn't utilize characters as nearly as well.For starters, Dr. Octopus is made out to be a laughingstock in this movie. His character is hard to take seriously because he's presented almost as though he's an oaf. This is immediately irritating because he's not like that at all in Spider-Man 2. He's an intelligent and fairly suave guy, but in this movie Spider-Man just makes him look stupid which isn't at all befitting of his character. The Green Goblin is never in his trademark suit except for his five second entrance. Don't get me started on Tobey Maguire. For fans of Sam Raimi's movies, his role in this movie is incredibly underwhelming. There's a joke about him looking like a youth pastor, and he gives Andrew a sweet pep talk, but aside from that they didn't take advantage of his presence. I mean, he's the original Spider-Man, yet he's treated as 'just another guy' as Ned refers to him. Andrew Garfield, from the worst Spider-Man movies, completely overshadows him. He has the much better reveal and a few memorable moments that focus on him. Tobey's Peter doesn't get anything special. It just irked me because of how much of a waste it was.Also, I feel like instead of doing something generic with the typical villains from the past, they could have had the original Spider-Men from alternate universes be evil while characters like the Green Goblin could have been good. And Tom's Spider-Man could have fought these evil Spider-Men. Something to that effect could have been cool. Maybe it would have been weird to see Tobey and Andrew as being evil, but it could have worked in a competent writer's hands. The writer of this movie probably couldn't cut it, though.Other problems have already been pointed out. The action sequences are good enough, but there's nothing particularly amazing or that could be called 'classic'. The humor is terrible like most gen-z humor. Aunt May actually makes a joke about octopi needing salt water to Doc Ock which is cringe-inducingly bad. I actually kind of like Ned's character, but MJ isn't very interesting, from what I've seen. This was my first Tom Holland Spider-Man movie.Anyway, this movie is overall a wasted opportunity. It has a lot in it, but it's all used in the most underwhelming way in the end. Could have been a really cool movie with all these classic actors. After all, it's meant to be fan service. Instead it was just OK.", "Spidey's greatest adventure with spectacular fan service!": "Leading up to the movie's release the expectations were sky high and I honestly thought that the movie would flop under the massive pressure of all the promises and clues there was given, but wow! It did not disappoint at all, and Marvel delivered an ambitious and high octane movie, worthy among some of the best superhero movies out there.Marvel brings a heartfelt, funny, sad, charismatic and chilling experience. A Spiderman movie that feels both part of the granter universe of the MCU, but also a focused Spiderman where he personally gets to shine without the other heroes \"stealing\" the spotlight. We see Peter Parker fully becoming the friendly neighborhood Spiderman with him going through a lot of hardship with tough decisions to follow. Tom Holland did an amazing job once again, but this time he truly showed what he is capable of as an actor. The cinematography feels pretty MCU'y but still there are some shots that are absolutely gorgeous.All around the acting was great and the storytelling was even better, despite there being some conveniently placed \"powers\" and incidents for some of the characters. The villains were of course also a big talking point going in, and I love that they didn't use them just as a cameo or a way to sell tickets. Every villain play a huge part in the core plot and brining it all together with the concluding ark for every character being wonderfully executed.As usual with marvel movies they have a hard time letting heavy and sincere moments linger. They have to abrupt the stomach aching feeling with a casual joke or witty dialogue to follow. I feel like they should have leaned more into the heartfelt moments for them to have a greater impact.After 10 years marvel is still able to bring amazing blockbusters to the screen, with one of the best Spiderman movies, if not superhero movies ever made. The fact that they managed to meet and even exceed the high expectations that were set for the movie is absolutely astonishing. My theater went wild multiple times, they laughed, they cried and I think we all left the cinema with chills and a smile on our face for both Spidey, but the entire cinematic universe as well.9/10.", "It lives up to the hype... For the most part": "I went into Spider-Man: No Way Home with huge expectations. After everyone had been hyping up this movie to be, like the best comic book movie since Avengers: Endgame My expectations for this movie were sky-high. And for the most part this movie met these expectations. It's a shame I didn't get to see it in the theatre though, becasue I would have loved to have seen this movie on the biggest screen possible. But hey, better late the never.My POSITIVES for this movie:1. It's the most ambitious Spider-Man movie to date.2. Tom Holland gives his best performance as Peter Parker / Spider-Man so far in the MCU.3. The villains are scene-stealers. Especially Willem Dafoe returning as Norman Osborn / The Green Goblin.4. The third-act is SPECTACULAR.5. The cinematography and visual are AWESOME.6. It's very emotional at times.7. The supporting cast is charming, as usual.8. The action sequences are really impressive.9. It ends the trilogy on a high-note. And it also teases many cool things to come down the road.My NEGATIVES for this movie:1. Certain people in the film feel a little out-of-character at times. And I didn't really buy the setup for this film 100%. Which is a little unfortunate.2. The fan-service was a bit of a mixed bag for me.3. The treatment of Sandman in this movie was very disappointing to me.4. I found some logic holes in this movie, that kind of bugged me a little.5. The MCU humor interrupts the flow of this movie a few too many times.My OVERALL THOUGHTS on this film:Spider-Man: No Way Home lives up to the hype, and delivers a grand finale to this trilogy, that offers emotional closure, thrilling action and a lot of awesome fan-service. Not to mention Tom Holland in top-form.I will definitely be re-watching this movie for years to come. And whenever I get a chance to see a re-release of this movie in the theatre, I will be swinging over there, like Spider-Man himself.This movie is one of the best Spider-Man movies, I have ever seen. As well as one one of the most fun, crowd-pleasing comic book movies I have ever seen.It realliy is one for the ages, when it comes to superhero films. I loved it.", "A fun surface-level blockbuster plagued by nostalgia": "I've been a little turned off by the MCU ever since the likes of Ant Man & The Wasp, and sadly despite stellar reception from audiences and critics alike, No Way Home fails to recapture my interest.Sure- it's nice to have callbacks to spidey films of old (better ones, nevertheless) but when your plot revolves entirely around catering for nostalgia, I'm going to be disappointed. Does it live up to the hype? Absolutely not. Some scenes were well handled and the comedy worked more often than not, but No Way Home feels more like an episode of an average disney + TV series than anything elseI'm glad people are enjoying it, but I expected more considering the mountain of hype.", "The people's Spider-Man film": "They return!This film felt more like the peoples film instead of a proper Spider-Man film, with the inclusion of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. The whole build up to this film evolved around Spider-Man fans wanting the old Spideys back. I've got to say I was one of these people, from the start I believed that despite any of the flaws that the film might potentially have (whether is was a big or minor flaw) it would be saved by the audiences excitement of Tobey and Andrew coming through the multiverse's portals.StoryOne of the things that I have a problem with about this film is the story within it. I came into the film as a fan of Spider-Man, not the MCU and the multiverse within it and if you aren't a fan of this, like me, then the whole story will appear very confusing. The way in which Dr Strange can access the multiverse through his \"magic\" just doesn't sit right with me, it takes away from the \"friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man\" that we once loved. Like the original Spider-Man trilogy and the two amazing Spider-Man films, this film and version of Spider-Man isn't in its own independent world, which isn't necessarily a problem, however all that goes on within the multiverse is very overwhelming for one to comprehend, especially for a child to understand. I would honestly rate this storyline as possibly the worst of every Spider-Man I've watched. I didn't enjoy homecoming and far from home too much, but the stories were a lot more simplistic and still somewhat felt like your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, without the overloading hassle of the MCU and the multiverse.Were they all worth it?Looking back at the movie, I view all the villains as quite pointless in ways, all of them had their own story lines in their original films and had a more than satisfactory ending. This brings in the question of why they're in this? It's because of what the people wanted to see despite any ending that they already had, it's completely nostalgic! Some of the most iconic Spidey lines and actions from the old films were performed by Tobey and Andrew, it's exactly what the people wanted! Despite my love for Tobey Maguire and his version of Spider-Man, I honestly didn't feel like he needed to be in the film, his story was complete. He ended his trilogy by making up with Mary Jane with the final hug we saw in Spider-Man 3. It would've made more sense to have Andrew Garfield in the film however, as his films were far from complete, the amazing Spider-Man 2 literally ended with a cliffhanger before the battle with rhino. And honestly, I think I would've preferred him to compete his trilogy than feature in this film. These two iconic Spider-Man actors were only in the film because of the revenue it would bring in. They obviously didn't spend much time over the script writing because they knew despite any criticism this film would have, it would make a lot of sales. To put it into context, these two older versions of Peter Parker seemed a little bit off their personality from their retrospective films, and I've got to say, I wasn't completely satisfied with it, despite my excitement for the nostalgia.ReflectionMy honest opinion about this film remains the same, of course I loved every moment I saw Tobey and Andrew, but the scriptwriting was quite frankly the worst I've see from a Spider-Man film. A lot of people were blinded by this due to the excitement levels of seeing the old Spideys back. And I beg to ask myself how people honestly thought Spider-Man 3 and the amazing Spider-Man 2 were too \"cluttered\" because a lot of this film was full of useless scenes and interactions between the characters. As I'm trying to be an unbiased fan of Spider-Man, I'm overall disappointed with the film in general, despite my excitement levels.", "Just a set up for something else!": "Average fan service movie especially for the under 18, very disappointed with how the story went, yes it's about Spiderman but this movie sounds more like a set up for Doctor Strange 2 rather than anything else.", "A movie to make your bad year great": "Awesome movie. Great ending. Don't know if they can make movie like this in the future again but this movie was something of a landmark for mcu phase. Now we can say the first movie of mcu was in 2002.", "NO WHERE NEAR A !)) but still the best of the three...": "The first half is lousy, the supporting characters are weak and the comedy (as with EVERYTHING disney) is immature and forced but the second half is pretty good. It's too bad all the surprised were spoiled before the movie came out - and those 'surprises' are what makes this movie amazing at times. Tom Holland is good but not the best. I'll never watch it again (like most MCU movies) but it's def worth watching (especially if you liked the first two bores) for the surprises that SAVE the movie. If it weren't for THEM, I'd give it a six.", "Storyline is suck!": "In my personal opinion, the storyline about Peter Parker wants to save some monsters without thinking about consequences to derail the multi parallel universals. That's insane & non sense.This is the worst Spider-Man film at the past few decades. Very disappointed!!!", "This is a MASTERPIECE!!": "THIS IS A MASTERPIECE\nWhat a Movie man ; this is a Kind of Movie which is Made once in a Lifetime.What a Pleasure to watch my Heros;\nThat Nostalgic Feel while watching ; the emotions; the Humours Dialogues make this Movie outstanding.", "Fitting conclusion to Holland's Arc as Spiderman": "Right off the bat, I must say I enjoyed this film a lot, but this doesn't change the numerous problems the first act of this film has. And quite honestly I'm surprised that not a lot of people have been talking about how weak the premise for the plot is. It involves Doctor Strange (one of the most responsible characters in the MCU) going through with an irresponsible and quite frankly stupid idea that Peter comes up with that causes various Spiderman villains arriving in their reality. The problem explains itself. Once I look past that, I see a excellent Spiderman film that delivers on so many levels for so many people. If you like Tobey and Andrew's Spiderman films than you have them appearing in this, if you like the idea of Tom's Spider-Man's love interest than you have him and Zendaya who have great chemistry on screen and give you a romance that you can buy into. If you like Doctor Strange and multiversal madness, then you have that, if you find Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin to be the best live action Spiderman villain than you have him making an appearance. As you can quite clearly see from those examples there is plenty of fan servicing elements and I honestly find it amazing they managed to put it all together and make a coherent story. Is it a great story? Not necessarily but it has nice moments and provides a great end to Holland's arc and even gives him a 'Uncle Ben moment' which in my opinion was one thing his Spiderman was missing.", "A MUST SEE Film": "My only negative critique would be that I wish that some scenes were slightly extended as well as some events happening slightly earlier to allow for more content. Other than that it was an incredibly fantastic movie, at many points I was hit with nostalgia, awe, and it brought many tears. Even if you've never seen a Spider-Man movie THIS is one that you MUST see!", "Brilliant!! Absolute Masterpiece!!!": "This was such a perfect film, definitely one of the best marvel movies and one of my favourite movies ever. The story, direction, action, music and performances were excellent and extremely well done! I It was great seeing all the villains from previous Spider-Man movies return and my Childhood Spider-Man (Toby McGuire) and the brilliant Andrew Garfield's versions show up too. All three spider-men interacting and bantering felt so surreal and was one of the main highlights. The chemistry between Zendaya and Tom was beautiful and Jacob (Ned) as always made me laugh. Certain scenes were very emotional and had me in tears, including the ending of the film which I admit was necessary for future plot points. I love Tom Holland's portrayal of Spider-Man/Peter Parker and I can't wait to see him again in upcoming Marvel/ Solo Marvel Spider-Man projects.", "No Spoiler please": "\u26d4 No Spoiler please \ud83d\udcf5\ud83c\udfa6.

The name is enough..", "Excellently-executed Spider-Man story.": "'Spider-Man: No Way Home' is the final piece of the MCU/Sony trilogy, all in under five years. It's also Holland's 6th time playing Peter Parker and essentially serves as 'Doctor Strange' 1.5, bridging to 'Multiverse of Madness' next year. This film picks up right where 'Farm From Home' left off, with the world now knowing Peter is Spider-Man, which make things very difficult for him, MJ (Zendaya), Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), Ned (Batalon) and Happy (Favreau).Peter goes to Dr Strange (Cumberbatch) for some magical help, which triggers a multiverse \"issue\", with - I don't think this is a spoiler after all the trailers & press - villains from the pre-MCU Spider-Man films being pulled into the MCU. This includes Dr Octopus (Molina), Green Goblin (Dafoe), Electro (Foxx), Sandman (Haden Church) and Lizard (Ifans) all trying to figure out why this Spider-Man is different. It borrows a bit from 'Into the Spider-Verse', which is a good thing, as that film is superb. Along with them, the big reveal is that the multiverse Peter Parker's - Toby Maguire (now 46) and Andrew Garfield (now 38) - are also pulled into this world. This provides both some funny and insightful moments.Peter's close to losing control a few times here, and the final act does a good job of raising the stakes and helping him realise his role, his morality and mortality. There's quite a few touching moments, and with all MCU films, the ensemble works well here - it's great watching Peter, MJ and Ned together, and it's not too corny having the other two Spider-Men involved. Dafoe reminds us of what a good actor he is. All the throw-back villains and Maguire/Garfield could've made this seem like a lame cash-grab, but it really works. I had great time and enjoyed the simultaneous happy and sad ending.", "Great but not the best": "It was great with a lot of fan service, but that was also the downside. I don't think this movie has a lot of rewatch ability. Everything this movie does I still feel Infinity War does a lot better. The plot had a few wholes and wasn't too great. It's one of the better marvel movies but not the best and IMO not the best Spider-Man movie either. Still totally worth a watch.", "Non Spoiler review for a Peter Parker story": "This film does absolute wonders to keep its focus on Pete's character and to grow him into what he should be and what the fans were craving for.He is self-made after all.A story about Peter and Spider-Man where tragedy should be a middle name.10/10.", "Good, if": "You can forget how dumb the story is. The graphics are bar none, and I love seeing all the old characters. The greatest scene is all the Spider Men talking.Not a fan of MJ or Aunt May in the Tom Holland universe, but they aren't horribly distracting. I just don't think MJ adds anything to the story - Ned, the goofy friend is more entertaining. Cumberbatch is great, of course, as Dr Strange, but there's no way he would get outsmarted in any way by a teenager. And why, so he and his friends can go to the college of their choice? I understand that a kid would be stupid enough to want that, but Dr Strange would never say yes to that.But again, ignore the plot device and focus on the graphics - superb!", "Glad I didn't pay to see this": "Tom Holland Spiderman is just stupid. He makes problems for himself and that is just so annoying to watch because you can predict how the movie will go from the beginning of the plot. The rest is just full of pathetic when they try to make you sympathize with the MC but you just can't. I would suggest to skip this movie and watch some old Spiderman movies with Tobey Maguire instead.", "Lack of Writing": "Multiuniverse, 6 villains, 3 spiderman, love, sentiment all are good but missing a item song. Nothing special in storyline, very thin story that film concentrated on kids.", "This movie is great, especially in IMAX\u00ae, but it has too many plot errors.": "To me, this film was great, at some point. Peter Parker is true ego of mysterious superhero named Spider-Man. But when his former arch-nemesis Queentin Bake( I may be mistaken here, because I forgot his real name) aka Mysterio reveals his identity, his life has changed a lot. That interfered Peter's personal life a lot, like he needed to change his school and home. Along with his girlfriend MJ and best friend Ned, he decided to go to school in Boston, but due to his identity revealed, school refused to take them both. When hardest time comes, Peter decided to take help from Stephen Vincent Strange aka Doctor Strange. Doctor Strange tried to use spell that let everyone forget about Peter Parker is a \"Spider-Man\", but it failed.It failed, but Peter takes help from Flash( famous bully) and talks to Boston school's principal and everything starts.Doctor Strange's spell messed with 'multiverse' and...famous villain \"Doctor Otto Octopus\" and Norman Osborn aka \"Green Goblin\" come to Peter's universe! Oh, it didn't end with that also Lizard, Electro, Sandman come. Peter caught them all, but he find out they all (almost all of them) are gonna die in their universe. But Doctor Strange show no mercy and was about to send them back to their verse. And then Spider-Man and Doctor Strange has short duel and Spider-Man defeated Strange with little bit agility and cunning. I don't wanna spoil anymore, but only one thing. Andrew and Maguire's Spider-Man enter-up was amazing.This movie was masterpiece but it's like too many plot errors.", "This is the great movie of Spider-Man: No Way Home": "I loved this movie. This movie is really awesome. No longer Sorcerer Supreme after disappearing for five years, Strange seems bored and reckless, happily going for Parker's rash suggestion that he cast a dangerous spell to restore Spider-Man's secret identity.", "Superb": "Nothing short of fantastic. Tom and co were outstanding in their performances, perfectly balancing humour and emotion. By quite some way the best live-action Spider-Man film.", "Pathetically Predictable Vanilla Disney": "Marvel manages to inject the same old generic humour and storyline to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. The main issue with this is that by avoiding causing any offence, it is impossible to create a hateable villain. Everything this film does, Spiderverse does better.", "Sort of fun, for a limited definition of fun": "This was mostly fun, but went a bit too far with the nostalgia stuff.For instance I'm pretty sure nobody remembered before watching this film that Andrew Garfield was in at least 1 and maybe as many as 3 Spider-Man movies. And I don't think anyone liked it/them, or remembered them at all, never mind fondly.And who remembers the sand guy? I think he was in that one movie everyone was bored by due to too many villains. Like this movie.And who remembers electrical shooting man, whoever he's meant to be.Wasn't Jamie Fox a blue CGI frog in one of these movies, and I have no memory of a lizard guy - so yes, totally nostalgic for some characters that were so forgettable that minutes after watching this movie reminding me they exist and I already don't remember their character names.Still, it was pretty lighthearted and was entertaining enough that I don't regret watching it, but I almost certainly won't ever watch it again, let alone buy a copy.", "Best Spider-man movie ever": "I came into this expecting sooo much from this movie, and I can proudly say that it delivered and surpassed all my expectations by a milestone, wooow it was a great movie. The best spiderman movie ever without a doubt, though it still had a few issues. They saved Toms spiderman and made him mature up in ways I never thought possible with his etteration of Spiderman. This was a fantastic movie, 9 out of 10 from me. This movie saved the franchise and solved all the problems I had with the previous two films with Tom Holland. I definetly recommend it!!This was a emotional rollercoaster excatly like Avengers Endgame with, laughter, sadness, excitement and Fan service, it was generally an amazing movie.", "Wish I saw it in 3D": "Best of the Spiderman francise flat out. Ignore the bad reviews for real. What we got here is Zendaya. Sorry Im a sucker for a charming female who plays a strong feirce character without too much make up.", "for Spidey fans it shouldn't disappoint": "As if he weren't already an atypical high school senior, Peter Parker has his life thrown into disarray when the public learns that he and Spider-Man are one in the same. Unable to cope with the fallout he calls upon Stephen Strange to help undo the damage, but when the multiverse is undone by his meddling, the dangers for Parker grow exponentially. Big, bold, and exceedingly ambitious take on the titular superhero is slow going at first, then kicks into gear with a multitude of clever in-jokes and self-referential winks at the camera, some amusing jabs at the court of public opinion, dynamic action scenes, and more laugh-out loud moments than can be counted. Lots of little interwoven goodies for fans to look forward to, plus a wave of nostalgia and a surprising amount of emotional gravity and vigor make this much more impactful than the recent MCU fare, headlined by Holland and a slew of invaluable co-stars. ***\u00bd", "Absolutely Terrible": "Were we watching actors or were we watching animated creatures all the time? I mean what was this movie? Were was the fun? Just cheesy Marvel jokes. Where was the mystery and excitement in the story? Actings were so fake and ingenuine. Music was mid. Nothing special about cinematography or direction for that matter. All of the stupid stuff that happend in this film could be easily and sensibly avoided. It was just a lazy writing scenario. And do not get me started on the leaks that the studio released themselves just to create a fake clout and spend nothing on marketing and in order to lie to people.

But do they all justify themselves and did the new film need to be based on past events? The previous movie ended with everyone knowing about the true owner of the Spider-Man costume. Did it have a good effect on Peter Parker? I don't think so, because he began to be pushed from all sides, such a revelation greatly influenced the hero's friends and aunt.. Because of this, Peter dropped his hands and went for help. Then, because of a mistake, everything went downhill and events took on the scale of multi Universes and other spider-men.

It's definitely not a perfect movie by any means, if you look at it, there are a lot of plot holes, things that don't make sense but you quickly jump over them when it hits you with nostalgia that from my point of view has succeeded to the maximum.

I literally walked home crying.Oml I just hate mysterious so much he messed up everything ugh.", "Home is where you make it": "As that mumbly guy in The Waterboy said: Home is where you make it! Edit: The mumbly guy who said this was actually in Joe Dirt.This is how fan service is supposed to be done. Also, it doesn't really feel so much like fan service as it does a wrapping up of loose ends that maybe people didn't even realize (or had forgotten) were loose! Here they're wrapped up in a bow and given as a gift to fans of all the Spider-Man movies.Dr. Strange's trippy mirror dimensions and portals and crazy incantations propel a multi-verse plot that pretty much ensures your favorite Spider-Man will have something important to say and do before it's all over.This movie is definitely top 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (I'd put Infinity War at the top, then Civil War, then maybe one or two of the Iron Mans, but Spider-Man: No Way Home is definitely top 5).Tom Holland has done a great job as Spider-Man, but Andrew Garfield was always my favorite, because I felt he just nailed the Spidey snark the best and the stunts in his movies seemed the most realistic. But, if you'll read my review of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, you'll see I wasn't a big fan, and was non-plussed by the big emotional scene near the end.In the same way that Infinity War and Endgame somehow retroactively made many of the other MCU movies more relevant and interesting and significant, there is a scene in S-M:NWH where Garfield-Man saves MJ at the last second, with the very same move that was just a split second too late to save Gwen Stacy in his own universe. This was far and away my favorite scene of the movie, and it hit me in the emotional gut, and it magically, retroactively made me appreciate TAS-M2 even more.No Way Home is not perfect. I'm going to knock off three stars for the following grievous cinema sins:The May death scene made zero sense and seemed like a weird homage to the way that Tom Sizemore went out in Saving Private Ryan. The goblin craft had pretty much gone right through her, then she was in close proximity to a pumpkin bomb blast, so how was she able to just get up and give a final soliloquy? Because of this continuity error or just plain dumb editing decision, this scene lacked emotional oomph to me, but that's OK because I preferred the Garfield Zendaya save anyway.Was it just me, or were 3 of the 4 big action sequences set at night (1st Electro battle, Villains at the Apartment, and Statue of Liberty fight). That is a blatantly obvious and super lazy way to avoid showing detail in effects and stunt work, and I'm sure I'll be more and more upset about it as time goes on. Edit: I was thinking the only well-lit action sequence was Doc Ock on the bridge, but I forgot about the 5th big scene, which was also well lit: Dr. Strange vs. Spidey in the mirror dimension. For some reason, despite how much I liked Captain America: Civil War, I still tend to be rather dismissive (and forgetful) of Marvel's frequent \"heroes fighting heroes\" scenes, although Strange vs. Parker was one of the better scenes in No Way Home.Umm, I used to complain a lot about the fact that Raimi Green Goblin was just a mech suit. Seems like they tried to rectify that a bit here but they still hid Willem Dafoe's face a lot when he was full-on goblin and again - because it was night - you really didn't get to see much detail or color in the new GG look. Plus, they updated the mech suit to look cooler and then abandoned it. Kind of a dumb decision.OK, the only thing dumber than the May death sequence was the Maguire inconsequential non-death sequence. I'm gonna forgive that only because I was gonna be super-bummed if he ended up dying, but it's kind of a drama-killer to have 1/3 of your heroes receive a fatal stab wound and then shrug it off like it's nothing.All that said, I'm adding two of the three removed stars back, because I like that they acknowledged in a humorous way that Garfield's Spider-Man lacked the epic villains that the others fought, and then found a way for him to make one of the most important saves in the whole series anyway.Also, plot absurdities aside, the core of the story is that Peter would rather help the villains if he could than send them back to a fate of certain death, and that is very noble and consistent with the highest ideals of Spider-Man. So, the core of the story is solid and bold, even though every villain is familiar and old.My complaints notwithstanding, everyone involved with this film did a fantastic job of validating, honoring, and wrapping up three completely different Spider-verses, and that had to be at least as tricky a job as undoing the Thanos snap. And in my book, No Way Home nails its daunting task much better than Endgame did.", "I cried watching \ud83d\ude22": "This was one of the best Spider-Man films. I honestly thought it had a lot of great action scenes and storyline. I thought the part where Tobey's Peter Parker and Dr Octavius reunite was very touching. It was like a father and son moment where they hadn't seen each other in almost 20 years. Definitely made me tear up. Great film!", "Could've been better, could've been worse...": "I won't lie, I was hyped to see this film and during the build up of 'no way home' coming out, I couldn't wait to see how it would unfold. The first thing I'll say is the film didn't really live up to the hype, which was a little disappointing but it didn't stop me enjoying the film one bit.The idea of introducing the multiverse was a clever way to re-introduce characters from previous iterations of Spider-Man films however some characters in this film that were re-introduced felt unnecessary and purely fan service. For example, 'the lizard' (Rhys Ifans) felt so pointless and irrelevant throughout the film. This character was sidelined for a majority of 'no way home' and served no use to the plot besides showing up when the plot required so. This also seemed to happen with Sandman too. I understand to make the film less bloated, it was a wise choice to sideline some villains but if that's the case, they may as well not have been in 'far from home' and the main villains should have just been more centre stage.The way they introduced Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield also felt quite uncreative as they just showed up out of the blue and it felt quite rushed which was weird because at times the film felt like it was slow paced. The three spider men however, worked well on screen together and this was interesting enough on its own to carry the second half of the film.Another issue I had with the film, was that it seemed to heavily rely on expecting viewers to have seen the 'MCU' films. This could cause problems for new viewers or people just trying to watch 'no way home' just as a casual one-off film. I understand that having a connected universe with so many films, that referencing and cameos are obviously going to happen but some conversations and interactions between the characters would have made next to no sense to nee viewers whatsoever.To be honest, the film was enjoyable, despite the flaws and the way certain characters were handled was brilliant. It was great to see characters like the 'Green goblin' (Willem Dafoe) and 'Doctor octopus' (Alfred Molina) return to the big screen. Out of the the whole film, I'd say Willem Dafoe's performance stood out and showed how impressive Dafoe's acting skills really are. The way he portrayed 'Norman Osbourne' and the 'green goblin' was exceptional and it definitely carried the film somewhat.Overall, I'd say this is a pretty good film and easily the best of Tom Holland's Spider-Man films. 'Far from home' doesn't live up to its hype but it doesn't stop the film being fun to watch from start to finish. The way the film ends also leaves a lot of room for more Spider-man films and also gives the writers an opportunity for new directions to take 'Spider-Man' (Tom Holland) and his story. The re-introduction of characters from previous Spider-Man films was also a nice touch and being a fan of Toby Maguire's trilogy and Andrew Garfield's films, it felt good to see them back again as Spider-Man and give their versions of the web slinger a final good bye.Viewed at ODEON cinema\n14/2/22.", "I Cryed In Theater.": "THANK YOU MARVEL STUDIOS, i waited this with euphoria and great expectations and i was not disappointed.

But this film finally changed it. It went to really dark places and Tom finally understands what it means to be Spiderman. It actually feels like the real origin of Tom's Spiderman showcasing the best qualities & worst tragedies of Spiderman. Finally I care about MCU Aunt May & MJ. The old villains return and a really empathetic story is built around them. Willem Dafoe steals the show again & establishes why Green Goblin is the arch-nemesis of Spiderman.

This genre epic is a real game changer with astounding action sequences, eye-popping visual effects, a strong nostalgic feel, and a few big surprises.

Adherence to contemporary ethos (and Disney family values) is painfully evident as we are told that the supervillains aren't really bad and that the goal should be to cure them (which apparently is pretty easy), not eliminate them (always a challenge) - time to defund The Avengers and assemble a team of super-social-workers instead. I suspect that script, like the unbearably plucky characters, are targeting the 'tween crowd, but I found the 'humour' to be painfully juvenile, especially the antics of Parker's friend Ned (Jacob Batalon), which were tiresome from the moment he appeared on screen. The central premise (about which, to avoid spoilers, I won't elaborate) is interesting at a number of levels but the movie is far too long for the story it tells (the script writer seems to have been paid by the word). I also found the abrupt jumps between pathos and levity jarring (cry for the tragic death of a major character then cut to further Ned/MJ buffoonery). Too bad they can't find the balance between the jejune silliness of this film and the dismal dourness of 'The Batman' (2021) but, considering the cash this opus pulled' in I suspect that they aren't looking.", "Marvelous Movie but there also some wrong information told in this film": "Okay guys now you will wonder what's wrong information is in this movie.When Ned asked to Tobey \"Do you have a friend\"?And he replied \"Yess, I did and he died in my arm after he tried to kill me\"What the heck is wrong with Jon Watts haven't he watched the Spiderman 3 (2007)\nHe died saving his best friend \ud83d\ude2d", "Spider Man we have been waiting for a long time": "From beginning to the end it was all pure class. Keeps you hold your breath and you keep guessing what is going to happen next. I was expecting for something spectacular and even more surprising revelations I got. Acting was on point, cast is awesome, visuals were a little darker, but the action fulfills it.This movie gives you all you've come for - action, drama, comedy, love.I'm sure there will never be the spider man movie like this, at least the next couple of years.", "I would go on and on but let me just put it this way": "10/10\nIt's seriously perfect.It is damn near flawless.As good, if not better, than endgame.I need to see it again as soon as possible.It lives up to all of your biggest expectations, hopes, and more.You will not be disappointed.", "Marvel & Sony have done it !!": "There couldn't had been a better film than this for all of us Spider-Man fans out there..at first when I heard the basic plot of this one which was to bring all the villains from the previous Spider-Man films coming into one film,I felt how will they do it ?? Then when I heard all the 3 Spider-Men..yes you heard it right..Tobey Maguire,Andrew Garfield returning as Spider Man along with Tom Holland in this one..I was like this is insane..if the people at Sony and Marvel manage to pull this entire thing,it will be the biggest and the best Spidey film ever till date for sure..and man they have done it and I still can't believe we actually got to see Tobey & Andrew again as Spider Man !! It was a visual delight to watch all 3 of them together in not just one or two scenes but the entire 2nd half which was more than an hour to be precise...the story,the VFX,the performances etc everything was just brilliant !! All the villains did their job best with Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe leading them..The future of Spider-Man series looks very promising for sure..here's hoping for more adventure with my favourite Marvel character (of course Spider-Man \ud83d\ude02) in the upcoming films...all the MCU & Spidey fans,go and watch this and I promise you won't be disappointed even for a bit..and yes don't leave without watching the 2 Post Credit scenes !!", "Finally it's Here !": "What a film, the rumours have been rife for so long. How did they manage to keep this quiet.To put this film together is the work of pure genius. Marvel spare no expense for their superhero fans.I do miss Maguire and Garfield. They both did an amazing job as Spider-Man and this was an amazing tribute for old and new fans.Tom Holland did his best performance to date.One of the very best superhero films.Thank you marvel \ud83d\ude00\ud83d\ude00", "The Perfect Tribute!": "Rating: 9This was a movie long awaited by Spidey fans! One word of advice this movie is made for the cinemas. The experience is unparalleled. The plot as we see from the trailer is Spider-Man taking the help of Dr. Strange and trying to patch up his past however this creates a rift in the multiverse and invokes more trouble.The Good - The performances!!! Wow, I loved Tom Holland here. You could feel his Spider-Man is emotional and no longer a kid who relies on external help (cue Iron-Man). The movie pays the perfect tribute to the previous Spider-Man flicks. For example - Willem Dafoe (Green Goblin) and Alfred Molina (Doc Ock) were brilliant, like these guys are over 65 years and they look the same as they were before :) The Raimi trilogy was dark as the villains involved were intense, they gave Spider-Man a really hard time and in this movie nothing changes. This movie brings back serious nostalgia with all it's moments. The CGI, soundtrack, cinematography and the performances were brilliant!The Bad - Well, I did feel some moments were stretched. The movie felt more packed than Avengers Endgame but it also brings in nostalgia. While I appreciate some light hearted moments (Marvel movies are famous for that) I believe the movie could have done without a few.That's all! This is a must watch for Spidey fans! Watch this movie in a cinema hall and go without scoping for spoilers. And do watch out for the two end credit scenes, they are worth it :)", "The Spider-Man Masterpiece!!": "If there were a infinite rating I would give it! This movie was so goooood it's not even funny!! The pacing, the action, the villains, the characters, the comedy everything about this movie was fantastic except for the cgi. The cgi ok. Don't listen to the people that say this movie was carried by nostalgia. If you haven't seen it, plz watch it!!! One of the best cbm movies!!! This movie was just everything a Spider-Man fan would wish for their entire life. Acting was very good and Willem Defoe was MAGNIFICENT!! According to me this movie was even better than The Batman even though that was a masterpiece too!!", "Great Movie": "This movie was a great film and it had three spider man's in it from different universe and the villains along with them as well, it is sad at moments but over all it's a great movie.", "MAGNIFICENT": "THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS REALLY AMAZING\nI can't wait for the next Spider-Man!I loved every second of this masterpiece! You must to watch It!I wish that in next Spider-Man, his friends can remember who he is.", "Dr. Strange will Return": "This movie is ok but it's a bit like a rehash of old Spiderman movies. It really doesn't advance Spiderman in any way. It slightly advances Dr. Strange towards the next thing. But as a Spiderman movie it's not really that interesting. I don't know if any of them really are but the ones with Tobey Maguire were actually good movies. The new Marvel Universe just keeps rolling out movies. This is just another with no real point. Marvel just put them out and people watch out of habit. They're like fast food movies. You know what you're going to get and it's a familiar taste that appeals to the wider population. That really doesn't mean it's good, just popular. The worst part is killing off Aunt May. Inexcusable. The only actual character in the film and they kill her off.", "A M A Z I N G": "OMG this is the best movie ive ever had in the past years, feels like a brand new experience and in a way that is awesome, this review will contain spoilers so DONT SCROLL DOWNWhen i first saw Doc Ock everybody in the cinema started screaming, with Osborn it was kind of the same.THE BEST PART OF THE MOVIE is when Ned starts opening a portal and OMG! IT WAS AWESOME DAMNNNNN, MJ and Ned screaming to Andrew \u00a8Peter, Peter\u00a8!Later on appared TOBEY MAGUIRE, LITERALLY EVERYBODY STARTED SCREAMING.My favorite parts was when Andrew said \"I love you guys\" and then they started SWINGING OMGGGThis is my review, its great, AWESOME, and its the greatest movie of SpiderMan or maybe the best of superheroes.11/10.", "Not worth all the hype": "I will be very honest here, the first two parts were much better as compared to thos almost 180 minutes drag saga.The whole concept of multiverses, old enemies and spideys coming together was brilliant however the execution was below average. The screenplay kills all the excitement that I had before going to watch this movie.The whole idea of Peter Parker trying to fix bad people was pathetic, considering that no teenager having such powers and being a part of Avengers who already fought with so many enemies, will think so.Sorry Marvel this time you disappointed in a big way.Just finished the movie by checking my watch every how and then.", "Best Spiderman film ever!": "Lost of words.. very happy with this film. Tom Holland executed this film any spiderman fan will sure satisfied with this movies please go out and check this movie out best film of the end of the year.", "The best live action superhero movie of all time": "This is not only my personal best live action spiderman movie and not also the best MCU movie for now but also the best live action superhero movie for now.This movie is literally amazing. Everything about it is almost perfect, from the emotional, nostalgic story to the great action, flawless vfx, some funny scenes and of course the actors who nailed it. Its ending is really satisfying for this MCU spider-man trilogy and I really hope they work on that rumored new trilogy with Tom Holland's spider-man especially with all the character developments done in this film.", "MCU's Best Movie since Infinity War": "HUGE SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!I'm at a loss for words. Spider-Man: No Way Home is perfect. It might be the nostalgia blinding me but the movie is just so well done...\nTom's the highlight of the movie. Amazing actor, amazing character. The soundtrack was really great with some of Elfman's and Zimmer's scores pushed there. The CGI was amazing, it never felt fake. The cinematography was good (the shot of the 3 Spider-Men at the Statue If Liberty and the shot of Peter in the rain listening to JJ are amazing and will definitely be future wallpapers). MJ and Ned were great. Glad this movie didn't have an unnecessary subplot and just told the story it had to tell. Doctor Strange was also great (still can't believe he lost a fight against Spider-Man though). Willem Dafoe also gave an amazing performance as the Green Goblin once again. Shame his original suit got destroyed in the beginning though... Alfred Molina's Doc Ock also was perfect. It was great seeing Charlie Cox's Daredevil for like 2 minutes. And now for Tobey and Andrew's triumphant return... My hands still hurt from clapping. I wasn't the only one though the cinema exploded. It was amazing seeing the 2 Spider-Men from our past. They both gave a great performance. Andrew's Spider-Man saving MJ is just the cherry on top that gave this movie some extra points. Aunt May's death hit harder than I thought it would... Great scene and great performance from the two actors involved in this scene.Honestly don't know what more I can say about the movie. It's perfect. My only tiny little nitpicks are that some jokes do fall flat and the Venom Post Credit scene was alright. Also I totally see how Peter could have just called the Avengers or even Wong to help him battle the villains. But overall, great movie and a great cinema experience. Definitely going on my top 4 movies here on Letterbox.", "Fanservice only, lacks everything else": "Boring story, stupid premise, terrible acting by hyperactieve actors, boring soundtrack, humor that's beyond cringe worthy, terrible fighting sc\u00e8nes, etc. I can't name a single good thing about this movie. One of the worst problems is that the sustained damage doesnt seem to have an impact on any of the characters. They just keep fighting until some sort of event occurs. All the Spider-Man movies suffer from this and it makes it unbelievable and boring. It completely relies on special effects for that. The entire movie is just fanservice for kids and teens. Other than it being low quality it leans heavily on trying way to hard on being \"modern\" by being hipster, hyperactive and multicultural. Also, the line \"with great power comes great responsibility\" worked really well in the first Spider-Man movie but it was just so terrible in this one.The 2018 Multiverse movie gave me some hope for the future but I guess the Spider-Man franchise is just ruined ever since it has been acquired by Disney.", "Super": "Cinema is an important part of our life, a separate cultural environment and an understandable topic for everyone to talk about. But first of all it is an attraction, moving pictures designed to awaken vivid emotions. Ask yourself: have you seen something really unprecedented in the cinema for a long time? Is something evocative akin to the feeling you experience when you first go on a roller coaster or bungee jump?Rarely does a film come out that is able to rally the audience as much as \"There is No Way Home\" is likely to succeed. In recent years, experts have been talking about the death of film distribution, but the final part of the spider trilogy restores justice in the industry and returns a large audience to the halls (even for a couple of weekends). The key to this phenomenon lies not only in the fan base: John Watts' superheroic sums up not only the events of the new reboot, but also the two previous series about Peter Parker, thereby forcing the audience to breathe, laugh and cry in a single rush.", "Good special effects and action. But stupid plot.": "Aunt May tells Spiderman (Peter Parker) you can't send the evil villains back to when and where they came from. They'll be dead. We need to give them a second chance. Peter Parker says yeah, I'm not going to do that.So one of the evil villains kills Aunt May. Peter Parker says it's all his fault. Well it partially is. But Peter Parker is only a kid. Aunt May was an adult. And it was her idea to save the evil villains and give them a second chance in the first place. So it was Aunt May's fault also. These are criminals who murdered people for personal gain and evil objectives. And Aunt May wanted to give them a second chance. Well, they got a second chance. And no surprise, they killed again. \"Too bad Aunt May. You wanted to give them a second chance.\"This is a metaphor for Black Lives Matter, Defund and Abolish the Police, and electing progressive DAs who don't want to prosecute criminals. And who want to reduce prison populations. As a result, crime is up nationwide (in the U. S.). This doesn't work in real life. And it makes no sense in a movie.Criminals need to be held accountable for their crimes. And innocent people need to be protected from them by putting them behind bars.Huge Plot Hole --- There is a enormous battle in the end of the movie around the Statue of Liberty that brings down all the scaffolding, and where Dr. Who cracks up the sky. Not one helicopter, policeman or press person shows up. Was the entire New York City in a coma during this battle? I thought it was the city that never slept?Ridiculous. Good special effects and action. But stupid plot.", "Best movie I have ever seen.": "This is positively the best movie I've ever seen. So unbelievable that I thought it was a dream.

Still feel energy that I felt in the theater.", "Orgasmic/nostalgic/Emotional": "Marvel you so beautiful now we are stronger than ever and who could've imagined via Spidey <3\n:).MCU your are spoiling us for good , extremely high hopes for future.", "Better than Avengers endgame": "In this movie we will able to see the spider-man in an very much meture way, with great power comes great responsibility and our friendly neighborhood spider-man understand he responsibility, all the actors co-actors had done a fantastic job.", "Good fan service": "It's a well done nostalgic trip, with a not much coherent story. If you discount that, you can have fun with the many familiar faces. I just don't think it's the ultimate wonder many think it is.", "Likeable but nothing special": "I really enjoyed the last spiderman film but felt disappointed with this one. The story line was really quite basic and not all of the humour was well placed. Having seen the trailer for the new doctor strange film, this spiderman movie almost feels like it was made in order to set up the premise for the doctor strange film. Great to see certain characters but the film lost its way in the mid section and there was never a real sense of danger or excitement with this one. It felt a bit lazy in plot and story telling. Not an awful film but not one that I will watch again.", "Movie of a Lifetime": "Never in my life will I ever have another cinematic experience like this. Never have I ever cheered so loudly during a movie in theaters. Ever. This will be my favorite movie of all time for a long long time, the story was phenomenal and it was so so enjoyable. It was everything I could have hoped it would be for the end of a trilogy. An absolute cinematic masterpiece. I cannot wait to see it again and I am excited to see what Marvel pulls out of it's sleeve next because they hit it not even out of the park, but out of this universe. Out of this dimension even.", "Try to see this movie spoiler free": "This is a spoiler free review and I would highly recommend that you watch this movie fresh and in a movie theatre. It is epic. It is packed with Easter Eggs and fan obsessed details - truly an homage to all Spideydom. Yet, you really don't need to be a Marvel geek to enjoy it. It is well written before it is laden with little treats. The movie is funny, heart stopping, heart breaking, complex, yet, accessible. Although the film begins with adventure, great battles, creative CGI and fascinating SciFi, for me, it surpassed itself in the second half. The acting is great. The great chemistry between Peter an MJ mirrors the off screen rapport between Tom Holland and Zendaya. This movie is a smorgasbord of star power. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}", "This really is top tier Marvel": "Wow! Loved it!I'd recommend not reading any reviews if you plan to watch it - I didn't and I'm sure glad I didn't! Spoilers inbound!Where to begin? I was not expecting to love this film as much as I do! It surpassed my expectations in every way possible, to the point that I'd say it beats 'Avengers: Endgame' as my favourite production from the MCU. This is a next level superhero movie, it's easily the most I've consistently enjoyed a film in this series and genre - no question.The cast are all outstanding, it's ace how they work everyone in from previous iterations of 'Spider-Man' - even away from the main universe. Seeing Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire together onscreen as Peter Parker is tremendous. The film does it in the perfect way, at no point does it feel forced or needless and the humour between the trio is excellent; in fact, the whole film is funny when it intends to be.Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon (his best showing of the trilogy), Jon Favreau and Marisa Tomei also add positives things to this 2021 film. Jamie Foxx, Alfred Molina and, most pleasing for me, Willem Dafoe all reprise their characters from past releases and are all a joy. I'm a fan of Dafoe so was particularly happy to see him reappear.Onto what we see onscreen. The plot is great and I wouldn't change anything about it, there is one or two things that I had question marks about whilst watching but those quickly dissipated. The pacing is top notch and the music is superb, the respective screen times of everybody was pinpoint and, along with the already noted humour, the film also packs a punch on a more serious level to boot.This really is top tier Marvel! Would watch again, would recommended etc. Awesome!", "I just wished see the spider men more": "That was really amazing and very very evocative everything that I expect to see them was in the movie. It was very emotional I was about to cry I expect it since the spiderverse animation realesed.I just hoped see the spider men more.", "Good but not perfect": "Basically the live version of into the spider-verse.Nice to see all the old spideys and a few of the villains, Foxx being the exeption (what a bore) .Final fight could have been better.", "Didn't like it": "I don't know why everyone is so hyped up about this movie. Maybe it's just that it's not preachy or overly woke like any other thing that comes out of Hollywood these days. That's the only good thing I could find about it.Here are the bad parts. First of all, it is like a movie made for kids. It tries to be funny but all the little jokes are terrible. Everyone is twitchy and talks fast, mostly trying to be funny I guess. Tom Holland plays the role of himself and is overly apologetic and therefore annoying.The story is underwhelming in my opinion.They bring back Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire but they didn't do any CGI on Tobey, he looks significantly a lot older obviously which is disappointing since I guess the idea was that all three of them should look like they did at the time of their movie.To conclude I'd like to mention that the movies I enjoyed the most were those from the Tobey Maguire era. Maybe it's because I was a kid and a lot more impressionable but I think these movies back then were a bit more serious and didn't try so hard. Everything seemed a lot more realistic back then, even for a comic book movie.5/10 from me.", "It's everything I ever wanted and much more.": "The acting, the reveals, the easter eggs, the references, the storyline and character development... it was all phenomenal. I've never been this satisfied by a movie since probably Endgame... and I personally didn't mind some of the cheesy moments, in fact I enjoyed them.", "Everything everybody says is good is amazing": "I swear the people behind this look at all of the videos praising the best parts and nitpicking the negative aspects of the past Spider-Man films and just creating something almost everyone can appreciate. Not only does this tie in every universe Spider-Man has been in, but it gives everyone a satisfying conclusion and hopeful needing they deserve. I saw this I'm IMAX with my family and a nearly packed theater even a week after opening, and it was an experience we never had together before. I sure there will\nBe nitpickers out there, but they don't need to be counted too much as this is the best you're going to get besides spiderverse. If you're one of the ten percent of the population who hasn't seen this get, get the heck to the theater already or ready your rentals, because this is for Spider-Man and mcu fans everywhere.", "Fan service with very little common sense": "I loved this movie because it brought back many characters from the past but it could have been written better. This feels like a last minute fanmade movie. The multiverse plot depends on the villains and other characters knowing that Peter Parker is Spider-Man but Electro and Venom in the movie did not even know that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Then it says that all of them died fighting Spider-Man where as three of them did not even die in their movies. There are other plot holes like taking the powers from the characters and sending them back would change their original timelines.But the worst part was making people forget that Peter is Spider-Man also made them forget Peter entirely. How does that work?It is still a beautiful movie with great performances from Alfred Moline, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. Willem Dafoe just stole the scenes whenever he is on.Rating it 5/10 feels balanced.", "A+++++": "Wow. I was super excited to see this, maybe because it was the first movie I was going to see at a cinema in over a year; maybe because I had heard about the possibility of the two other spidey's making an appearance.But this movie exceeded my expectations!!!Sorry for the spoilers but I need to get this out haha.That first reveal literally made me smack my husband with joy! Then the second made my heart do a little leap! AND THEN seeing them all interact with each other was pure magic!The ending was heartbreaking, and I would love to see how it all affected the other universes after they cured the villains instead of defeated them!And after May, I really wanted Peter 1 to have a happy ending as he's definitely become my favourite Spider-Man.Cannot wait to see what they do next!", "Finally! A good phase four movie!": "I don't think any of the new phase four Marvel movies are atrociously bad, I just don't think they need to exist after \"Endgame\" perfectly wrapped everything up. This movie changes that, introducing new concepts for the MCU to play with, and delivering fan service in a way that doesn't feel pandering. It also has some unexpected moments spread throughout that surprised me and everyone one else watching. Needless to say, this is the best one in the MCU's Spider-Man trilogy, and I'm glad that we were able to see all of these fun characters one more time.", "Crown of marvel cinematic universe": "This is is the best movie of spiderman ever made.Just watch it even if you are a fan or not.The movie contains every aspect.Perfect comedy.Perfect action\nPerfect surprises\nPerfect emotionThis movie is ine of the best things happened to us this year.Go watch it before you get spoilers.", "Everything a Spider-Man fan can possibly want!": "Spider-Man was one of the first movies I ever saw in theater as a kid. Growing up and seeing all the different versions and villains was really fun! And then... Tom holland came along! With big shoes to fill and an event bigger legacy, the kid did it all and this third movie is the proof of that! Being part of the MCU and still being able to bring everything together like this movie does is pretty impressive!This movie has everything: an amazing love story, an MCU legacy, amazing villains portrayed by the original amazing actors, and the original spider-man!!! What more could a Spider-Man fan want?", "With great power comes great responsibility": "Three versions of Spider-Man appear in the same box, which is really a surprise. May not appear to be a particularly good movie in some ways, but it is a very good one for people who like Spider-Man. Feelings are the biggest charm of the movie.", "Wow! Lots of Wow factor.": "Just gonna be brief inorder not to spoil this for anyone but this is how a perfect conclusion to a trilogy is done. Beautiful performances, very emotional, wicked stunts and CGI effects. Lots of moments to go wild in the Cinema with exclamations and nostalgia. Highly recommend this masterpiece of a movie. Only thing was less fighting sequences as compared to far from Home.", "A Dream Come True": "No Spoilers here but this is the most character driven Spidey film since Raimi's 'Spider-Man 2'. Everything in this movie is about the definition of Spider-Man, something that was somewhat lost in the first two Holland films. If you have grown up with each iteration of Spider-Man, all I will say is that this movie is everything you want it to be and more. It's about broken people who make mistakes and learn and I have not been this happy with a superhero movie since 'The Dark Knight'.This is the MCU's best film!", "FAN-SERVICE or MASTERPIECE ?!": "Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021): ~2h 28m movie, 1 Oscar Nominee.I have to give it to Director Jon Watts, this movie is Avengers level AMBITIOUS!Spider-Man is BACK on the screen with a story BIGGER than EVER! I actually can't believe this movie HAPPENED! Every time the complexity of a story is increased, it is also HARDER to execute it. Overall, compared to the other 2 Tom Holland Spider-Man movies, this film feels a bit MESSIER due to the INSANE story it has to work with. Also, I think there were too many dialogue scenes for my taste.Regardless: Even though Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) feels at times like it's losing control, I had a BLAST with it. It was a mixture of NOSTALGIA and HAPPY FEELINGS!", "Plot wirtten by toddlers?": "The plot was weak, written conveniently to enable all the things they wanted to present for the multiverse. All of a sudden a world full of super heroes allows 3 kids to do whatever they wanted and almost destroys humanity with no consequences. All this just because they didn't get into the school they wanted it....give me a break. Would've rated 0/10 if possible. What a waste of time. Oh and don't get me all the cheesy jokes and acting by the spidermans...barf.", "Surprisingly entertaining": "Tom Holland is my least favourite Spiderman. He's basically a teenage boy, annoying and dumb. His friends are annoying and dumb too. However this outing is surprisingly entertaining, if a bit long winded. Tom Holland's Peter Parker even manages to become slightly less annoying and dumb by the end, which can't be a bad thing.", "It's a Marvel movie": "For optimal viewing experiences, it's best to shutdown all critical thinking and just lose oneself in the escapism, fan service, and nostalgia. Because, otherwise, this thing could be nitpicked to death.", "Huge fan of marvel but this was such a disappointment": "Huge fan of marvel but this was such a disappointment. I love all the marvel movies but this one was terrible. The dialogue was written for middle schoolers and each scene is so drawn out. Just awful.", "Roller Coaster Ride!": "From great action sequences to emotional moments this movie offers it all. A great conclusion to the Tom Holland trilogy and one that really captures the essence of what Spider-Man as a superhero is all about.I honestly did not expect it to be this good due to the fact that most Marvel films are quite lacking in the story element and I mostly just watch them for the action sequences and great CGI. But this movie has such a great storyline and a really well thought out ending and a heart wrenching one nonetheless.", "It's a Spider-Man movie that exceeds expectations. Briliant! Briliant!!!Spoiler alert!": "This film is packed so incredible!The rumors are true everyone! I can't pretend that it's not! Matt Murdock is back, and Tobey and Andrew is back baby! The acting between 3 Peter Parker were overwhelming, emotional, like they were improvising their own dialogue, really good chemistry between them. Willem Defoe is the legend, a perfect man for Green Goblin. Max, Flint, Otto, Kurt Connors are amazing villain! Jon Watts gave us the best Spider-Man should be. Seriously, my hand was shaking when Tobey and Andrew really-really show up! I was clapping, proud, disbelief, got my tears! I can't be more satisfied than that!What a nostalgia! The best Christmas gift that I ever had! What a fan service!

In the first scenes cgi was good after them cgi was so bad. Literally jokes are not funyy also not nesecwrry . So movie was good but overrated one not deserve this imbd or hype movie was so enjoyable but not that good.", "Best spider?": "What has done Marvel is spectacular, people cheering in the movie like is a proper and funny amusement park. Of course one of the point on this movie is the nostalgia and how the multiverse is open in the cinematic universe, I loved how the antagonist is presented one by one and how the conflict is made, doesn't feel rush and bad thought, the cinematography and music is greatly better than the others one of this trilogy, much more mature.I think at the moment this film is going to have a better impact than Thanos or even Ultron had. Multiverse is real.", "The Spider-Man movie we've been waiting for": "I'm so happy right now. They really outdid themselves with this one.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic, ambitious and emotional movie that perfects the art of fanservice even better than Endgame, delivering easily one of the MCU's best movies.It manages to balance an insane amount of villains like it's easy. They all get a moment to shine, even the ones that inevitably get pushed aside.Some aspects of the multiverse logic won't make sense if you think about them too much, but other than that, this is the film you've been waiting for.Also, this is the scariest Willem Dafoe has ever been. That's saying a lot.", "Meh. Nostalgia won't save a bad story.": "Spiderman 1 and 2 are some of my favorite movies. 4 stars for bringing Tobey back. He is my favorite spidey.The story on its own without nostalgia was just meh. I was bored throughout it. Everything felt forced. The interactions between the characters, the romance etc just didn't feel natural at all. It was also highly illogical and the way Tom Holland's character and Aunt May's character behaved was plain ridiculous. Her death didn't make me feel anything whatsoever.Also if you are gonna introduce Tobey and Garfield, how awesome would it have been if Tom Hollands Spider-Man was getting his ass kicked and one of them comes out of nowhere and saves him. That was a lost opportunity right there. Instead we got a meh introduction. No surprise whatsoever.Don't be fooled by the high ratings. It's all just hype and nostalgia. I really wanted to like this but just couldn't. Don't go in with high expectations and you may enjoy it more than I did.", "Nice but this is it...": "No idea why it is rated so high.

Can't wait to watch it again.", "Original trilogy actors carry!!": "I'm sorry but Marisa Tomei as Aunty May doesn't work for me. After seeing her as a stripper in The Wrestler (incredible movie by the way), I can't see her as Aunt May compared to the original May. Tom Holland Peter Parker I kind of just want to get slapped in the face over and over, and Ned and Flash are just a complete joke, a metaphor of our woke modern times. Tobey Maguire, Sandman, and Willem Dafoe are the only reason for the 6 stars, because they are absolutely fantastic and I cheered seeing them again. Go watch the original trilogy now! And then you'll realize how much better they were, you can't even compare them to these Marvel movies today!!", "I thought I would love it but I didn't": "This movie has great moments on it. Having all the bad guys from previous Spider-Man movies was fun and made for some great moments. The reasonings for all of this made little to no sense. After getting outed as Spider-Man Peter Parker upends the lives of his best friend Ned and his girlfriend MJ. For some reason he thinks changing this event would help his friends go back to normal and goes to Dr. Strange to make this happen. Well because Spider-man is an insecure mess he messes up the spell due to the fact that Peter Parker can't make up his mind. This causes people from other worlds to come to his such as Green Goblin and Electro. For some reason Peter Parker wants to save all of these people and lets them loose with dire consequences. That part made no sense to me. Why save the nemesis of Spider-man? The fact Tobey Mcguire and Andrew Garfield are in this movie made it more fun. The ending was just stupid and made no sense to me. How does changing the fact that no one knows he's spider-man alter his relationsihps with Ned and MJ. They knew him from school so that shouldn't have changed. I was dissapointed by this movie. I.", "My review": "Simply Incredible. Can't believe what I saw, Andrew and Tobey coming out of the portal. Tom Holland and Willem Dafoe masterclass. But the ending spell was sad af\ud83d\ude2d. Ned and MJ not knowing who Peter is. Same with the rest of the world.", "Not very memorable.": "Solid film but didn't live up to the hype. A lot of the movie was boring, slow and predictable with bad pseudoscience, emotional notes that didn't hit and a lot of fan service.The emotional scene that happens didn't really hit home either because I don't identify with the character and feel no empathy for them, the ending also felt a bit out of place but I have to imagine all of these things happened because of the Covid-MCU shuffle about with rewrites changing the movie to fit in with a timeline it wasn't meant to.All in all it does a good job of not letting its scheduling problems/rewrites 'ruin' the movie and continues the MCU storyline without it being a bad movie, but it's not the best movie either. It's pretty forgettable as a movie experience and it's only held together with a few action scenes, a bit of comedy and fan service harkening back to previous 7 Spiderman movies.I've only rated 7/10 because the actors bump it up from a 5 or 6, it's still an enjoyable movie to watch once, but there's nothing drawing me back here, no clever plot execution or hard hitting emotional notes like in Guardians 1 or Avengers 4 & 5, it's just a mediocre film.", "A near perfect film, except for the missed opportunity of a lifetime!": "Why oh why did the writers not replicate the greatest Spider-Man meme in history? How hard is it to have all three facing each other in a triangle formation, then point at each other?!Otherwise, the writing and story was sheer brilliance in bringing together the three most iconic Spidey's from the big screen. This film triggered the max of every emotion - laughter, excitement, and tears (of joy). There were zero plot or technical issues. The comedy was spot-on, and probably the best of all the Spidey movies - quick sarcastic wit and fast execution for actual LOL's. The action scenes were outstanding with excellent S/VFX and choreography. The chemistry between all the actors was amazing, and the romance between Peter and M. J., convincing and tearfully joyful. The cinematography was excellent as was the score. The 148 min runtime flew by very fast with the perfect pacing, that I actually wanted to see more.By far the best Spidey film of them all. Will be seeing this one again for sure. A well deserved 9/10 - would've been a 10/10 had they done the pointing Spidey's!", "Best one since Infinity War": "Imo nothing will top Infinity War. For what it accomplished. The way it was presented. But this gets very very very close. This does new things and presents them in a fresh way somehowThey've done it. They're yet again ahead of the curve and understand how to get emotions out of the audienceA lot of this film tries to hint the reality. Actual real life events which leave you more immersed in the movie itself. I've never cried in a Marvel movie. Even when the legend sacrificed himself. But this movie came very close. The level of scenarios this film builds is mind-blowing.", "By far the worst Marvel movie to date": "My 1-star rating is relative to all other Marvel movies, not relative to all movies in general. This is by far the worst. It was a PAIN to sit through with so many cringe-worthy moments that just don't end. I'm sure kids probably loved every minute of it, but for adults? The 8.4 current rating just blows my mind.The movie's special effects are fine, so are Tom Holland and Dr Strange. Nothing fancy, but fine. The storyline is okay, but the acting is just so bad by literally every other character. The worst has to be the other two Spidermen, and the scenes with all three of them are just a torture to watch. I would've guessed a 3rd grader wrote the screenplay. I felt like my IQ just dropped 50 points listening to it.In comparison, the previous worst-rated Ragnorak was so much more enjoyable. It was ACTUALLY funny, as long as you don't take it too seriously. Chris Hemsworth makes a good comedian, but Tom Holland doesn't.I almost never give one-star ratings, but this movie deserves it.", "Didn't expect much, was pleasantly surprised": "I tend not to enjoy these big blockbuster superhero movies (with Venom being really the only exception) but my boyfriend LOVES them so he has me watch them all the time. I came into this movie having not seen the other two recent Spider-Man movies (or any of the Andrew Garfield ones, or the second and third Tobey Maguire ones) so I assumed I would be lost the whole time and asking a million questions. Well, I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun and actually pretty easy to follow with just a general knowledge of the MCU, and there were some genuinely hilarious moments. If you're like me and aren't a huge fan of these types of movies, give this one a try anyway. It'll surprise you.", "Why the rave reviews?": "I'm fifteen minutes into this and bored by the teen angst college nonsense. Maybe you had to watch all the other 'episodes' to want this one, but this is serious drivel. Maybe fun for pre-teens if that is the target audience. Bond films have a much more exciting sequence of events.", "A very entertaining Spider-Man movie!": "I am a huge Fan of Holland's Spider-Man, for me that just feels right. The \"Sony Spider-Men\" however are nothing I enjoyed. I tried to watch Mcquire as a little kid but was bored of it and saw something else instead.Then over the course of my life I've tried to watch them multiple times, each time coming to the same conclusion: They are not for me.So when the rumours started that they would be in it I was shocked, scared, what if they destroy MY Spidey triology. But then they were fun. So much I wished there was a short sitcom with all the 3 spideys.", "The mother of all crossover movies": "This is by far the best spiderman movie in my opinion. I'm a big fan of spiderman for almost two and half decades since I was in school. This is also in my top 5 MCU movies. This movie brings together all the spidy villains featured in the Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield movies, except of course Venom who features in a post-credits scene.The movie starts exactly where 'Far from home' ended. Spiderman's identity is out and the he's suspected of murdering Mysterio. The whole world hates him, partly fueled by our most consistent annoying Daily Bugel editor JJJ, who tells everyone that he told them so (i.e. That spiderman is a villain after all). This leads to MJ and Ned getting caught in the crossfire and all 3 of them losing out on their university admissions. Peter approaches Dr. Strange to request him to wipe the whole world clean of the knowledge that Peter Parker is Spiderman. Strange agrees to help, but the spell goes awry (because of Peter's many interventions as the trailer shows). Strange tries to contain the damage, but apparently some people from other universes have slipped into this universe. These include Doc Oc, Green Goblin, Electro, Dr Lizard and Sandman. But that's not all, there are two more unexepected characters who have come in.. Anyhow long story short, Aunt May dies though after repeating the age-old spiderman wisdom 'With great power ...' ; Peter and Strange nab and send all the villains back to their universes. However, it all comes at the cost of Strange having to wipe Peter Parker off the world's memory.The acting is great. The humour is on the higher side of a typical MCU movie. The writing is very tight in first hour and then in last half hour. Though for an hour in the middle, it drags on for no good reason at all. The last half hour more than makes up for it though. It blew me up for sure.If you haven't watched it in a theatre, don't wait and go now. This is an experience you just can't fully enjoy on a small screen, especially the final fight scene.The most incredible part of this movie are its action and the emotions you go through, because it makes you feel spiderman's pain and dilemma. This is the same pain and dilemma that every teenager goes through at some point or the other.", "The Best Spidey Movie of All time.": "I just literally became speechless after watching this. This has to be one of the greatest things that Marvel and Sony has done. Hats off to the cast and crew for this brilliant action-packed scenes.", "SO GOOD": "I smiled, laughed, screamed and cried at this film. It's honestly the best marvel film I've seen. I hope all of you get to watch it without being spoiled.Certainly not a forgettable film (see what I did there)", "Movie of the decade": "I don't know how to express this movie. My childhood is completed. The brilliance of the direction the story how beautifully they merged the three universes are outstanding! The villains whom we've grown up with. Watched it in theater and the crowd reaction shows how immense this movie was. Specially Andrew and Tobey's entry. After so many years a movie so satisfying!! 10/10.", "the best marvel movie i have seen in a while": "This movie hits everything on the dot. Everything just works and the nostalgia that comes from these amazing characters is phenomenal. The best spider-man movie. This movie lived up to the hype. This review is not meant to be an in depth review. You can find that in other reviews. I just wanted to give this movie ten stars on this app because it deserves it. I want to have a high score because it is truly amazing in every aspect.", "PHENOMENAL": "Never before have I ever walked out of a movie theatre with nothing but good things to say about a movie. The action scenes were great, the story was great, and I love the potential the movie ended off with for new movies or perhaps a tv show. I also love how they introduced Daredevil in a cameo, using the same actor from the Netflix series. 10 out of 10 stars. Amazing.", "Stunning like the Endgame": "Despite the second pandemic Christmas, it got a little bit special this year, with this last entry to Holland's Spidey Trilogy. I've never been excited like this since the Endgame. This is where the MCU Spidey and Sonyverse Spidey culminates. Though this is not original, 'Into the Spiderverse' did it first, opening storylines in the multiverse, but that was animated. That's my only complaint but the rest of the film was epic! Everyone will love it, from Toby's era to Andrew's. Might I say, Willem Dafoe is the best on-screen psychopath! His performance could be compared to Joaquin's Joker. Brilliant Actor!", "Greatest Tom Holland spider-man movie": "I enjoyed the hell out of the movie and I could rewatch this movie multiple times. I enjoyed Andrew a hell of whole lot, I loved tobey coming back, Tom because the most ultimate spider-man in this movie.", "A bunch of fun": "After hearing the leaks and seeing the trailers I thought it was going to be a stupid but fun movie with a weird story, a lot of fan service and references, but instead I got a movie that is taken seriously but also fun with some good action scenes accompanied by an incredible CGi and a very good story, which although based on fan service, is very well executed, and although despite all the characters and references, the film still feels like it has a tone own . This movie had no buisness being this good, being not able just to tell a compeling story but also satisfy the fans from all over the world. The movie isn't perfect, with a few plot holes that make me ask myself a few questions, but what bothers me is that it didn't reach the maximum emotional potential it could have, but even so, I still think I ran a tear or 2 a few times, such as the scene where aunt may die or the reunion between Peter and dock ock. What stands out the villains of this film, and especially the dialogue between them, and especially the scenes with the 3 spidermans, making not only some comedy scenes but also some even emotional ones such as the scene in which the 3 are talking about their future after the movies, about the people they lost and what responsibilities they mean, releasing the movie very high, not to mention the performance of wiliem Dafoe as Green Goblin, giving us one of the coolest villains ever created.", "This normie really enjoyed the movie": "I am not a Marvel fan but I know of Spider-man and these superheroes by face value. I enjoyed this movie still. Even more than Endgame because I could see myself watching this movie again and there were less characters. I had no interest in watching Endgame again after it was released in the theaters two years ago. Spider-man: No Way Home was funny, sad, and delightful. The rumors are true: the Spider-men from the other movies were there, and they had great chemistry with each other. I hope I can see them together again.There were two parts that got me emotionally:\n1) When Andrew Garfield's Spider-man saves MJ. I remembered how Gwen Stacy's death in the Amazing Spider-man 2 was a big deal in the franchise. When I saw the trailer for this movie with MJ falling, I thought \"Is MJ going to die? That's be ballsy\". But she was gladly saved by none other than Garfield's Spider-man, who didn't want Tom Holland's Spider-man to go though what he experienced. They all had their parent figures died (two Uncle Bens and an Aunt May). Garfield's crying was the icing on the cake.2)The end. I liked that it ended dark, unlike other Marvel movies. Being the hero he was, Holland's Spider-man decided to let Doctor Strange erase everyone's memory of him because he didn't want more mayhem. The Green Goblin killed Aunt May. I wanted him to ask out the memory-erased MJ at the coffee shop but I realized that he didn't want history to repeat itself when he didn't do it. Also, I was concerned about him not finishing high school when Peter decided to live alone. Then, it showed he was getting a GED. It put a smile on my face. Spider-man getting a GED, so it's okay if you get one too.It was fun watching this with the fans at the theater during opening weekend. I was anxious at first about the noise. But these are people who really enjoy seeing their characters on the screen. I even got into it during a couple parts.After this movie's box office success, there will be no excuses for studios. They should release their movies in theaters and not place them on streaming sites nor push their release. People will go to the theaters to see an anticipated movie even with virus motility. This movie is a great example.", "Everything I ever wanted in a spiderman movie": "This movie was for the fans it had 5 og villains Tobey and Andrew had so really cool moments with the three and it had Andrew save MJ exactly like the scene with Gwen it even had DAREDEVIL it even set up Ned as a magic user killed off Aunt May and set up the new doctor strange only thing holding it back is the ending it completely ruined the story arch for Ned and Peter and MJ and Peter.", "Amazing fun and nostalgic ride": "After the unexpected ending of the previous film Spiderman: Far from home, question marks appeared above my head. I didn't know exactly what they wanted to do with it and in which direction they were going. Luckily, that vision was held by director Jon Watts who became the first and only director to direct the entire trilogy at MCU. My conclusion is that this film for the Spiderman franchise is roughly what Endgame is for the Avengers. A movie with big stakes, lots of action and lots of characters. It lasted two and a half hours, but at no point was it boring. It was definitely made for the fans because it has a lot of scenes and references to the franchise, perhaps this is best seen by the initial reactions and reviews that are extremely good and the ratings that are currently perhaps too high for a film like this.I've always been a big fan of Spiderman, ever since the 1990s when I read comics and watched cartoons as a child and later through Raimi's first films in the early 2000s. I will not lie, this film is a great fun, loud, nostalgic, but also emotional ride, I especially enjoyed the last third of the film because of every event, scene and dialogue that took place until the very end. It is a full of fan service, it even used to bother me a bit, but as I said, the last third of the film paid off for everything.And the flaws, I would point out that there are too many characters in the film, so it was not easy to balance the time that some got in the film. I must also point out the downside of modern times, and that is that it was impossible for me to avoid spoilers as much as I tried, through trailers that in my opinion reveal a little too much as well as through various speculations and statements on the internet. Unfortunately, that spoiled my impression a bit, which would have been definitely stronger if I didn't know anything about this film.The trilogy ended with the best and highest quality film, and that is something that very rarely happens. I'm just wondering in which direction the franchise will go now.", "Great, but a tad overrated": "It certainly gave the fans what they wanted, but I found some of the plot elements a bit contrived. Conveniently bringing other spidermen from other universes to fight their villains was certainly fun, but it threw away a lot of my suspension of disbelief in the realism, even moreso than Infinity War and Endgame. This made it harder to consider the stakes as serious.I suppose that is forgivable for the amount of fanservice and ties back to the roots that added in an original twist, however. I still feel that an 8/10 fits this best and the 9/10 most seem to prefer is slightly above where it should be.", "not sure why its such highly rated": "It shouldnt be 9/10 frankly (its imdb rating so far). Its okish to me. Not sure whats special in it. Its a nice concoction of older sequels + nice performance from the lead actors. But not worth 9/10 IMHO.", "Cliche": "Boring, childish and stupid. I've mostly didn't enjoyed Marvel's movies but this is too much. I liked the movie \"Into the Spiderverse\" because the plot and this plot is only become a cliche if Marvel continues to make movies like this. I think this \"Muultiverse Madhess\" or multiverse fetish should've stopped after the Into the SpiderVerse. This movie only made me believe more in the Scorcese's idea about Marvel's films that they shouldn't be considered as movies.", "Spider nothing": "Empty, empty, empty. Stupid, stupid, stupid. This movie is impossible to watch if you are the lucky owner of at least a hundred grams of brains. Not necessarily in the head.A cheap nostalgia game with a sauce of poorly made acidic special effects. Boring. Disproportionately. Form without content.0/10.", "Freaking awesome": "This film was amazing.The thing I love about this film is the story the story is amazing I also love All the effects and the spider man suits in this film.This has to be the best spider man film ever.", "Spider-\"men\"": "A perfect culmination of Spiderman. The action scenes are electric, the acting is peak marvel, and the cinematography is beautiful. It is easily one of the best marvel movies, if not the best. Very much loved this movie!", "A good, but highly overrated movie": "No Way Home is at best an above average MCU movie. The movie is a 7 and definitely not an 8, let alone close to 9 (as it is here on IMDb). The movie offers a lot to invoke nostalgia (otherwise it would have been a 6) and the special effects are pretty great. Among the recent MCU movies, it's much better than Eternals, but can't say it's better than Shang-Chi.Why I feel this is severely overrated is that on IMDb, as of today, No Way Home is rated higher than Guardians1&2, Doctor-Strange, Iron Man, Civil-War, Ragnarok, Infinity-War, and Endgame. But it is not as good as any of these movies and not even remotely as good as the last 3 of those.", "Nearly perfect film, one of the best Marvel movies out there.": "This spiderman movie is one of the best marvel movies out there, and might be better than the first great 3 spiderman movies by sam Raimi.The comedy in this movie is great, and the emotion in the end is great as well.I can recommend this movie to all ages.Great movie.", "Made me cry": "Not everyone that a superhero movie makes me cry.But seeing 3 Spider Men on a big screen at the same time couldn't make me feel any other way.Everything is handled so well - main characters, villains, dialogues, storyline... never heard people so happy in the cinema before, not even while watching Endgame. Well done people, such an amazing work. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "Tom Holland is not a good Spider-Man.": "Like most movies, they peak at the beginning and after each one you ask why did they make another? Very few redeeming aspects from this movie and it's mainly the cameos. It's also really long for a forgettable film. Luckily I didn't pay to see it, unluckily I did spend time watching it.", "The best film yet in Marvel's Phase 4!": "The reason Spiderman is the most popular MCU hero as reflected by not one not two but three movie trilogies has always been his idealistic, uncorrupted world view as a teenager and the relatable mistakes , naivete and teenage drama he consistently goes through.Tobey McGuire embodied this in the original series and Andrew Garfield lent his own distinct take to the character. But Tom Holland has truly elevated the web-slinger to another level (or should I say universe) with a stunning performance in No Way Home that is not just an immensely satisfying film for MCU fans but also great cinema.As revealed in the trailer, Peter Parker goes into a panic after Mysterio reveals his identity to the world. He approaches Doctor Strange to cast a spell to undo the same, only for the Sorcerer Supreme's attempt to bend the multiversal divides, bringing all sorts of beings from other worlds into the MCU-verse.The witty banter between Peter, MJ and Ned continues to be the bedrock of the franchise and director Jon Watts and writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers never lose focus on that despite the immense source material and astronomic fan expectations they were given to manage.Enter Alfred Molina as Dock Ock, Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin and a menagerie of the greatest villains of the Spiderverse converging on New York to turn Peter Parker's world upside down. Dafoe is the greatest living actor not to win an Oscar and the seasoned thespian delivers a jaw-dropping performance as the cult antagonist, becoming the perfect counterweight to Holland's compelling lead performance.Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch and Marisa Tomei deliver heart-touching performances to really elevate the film, which also features some of the most imaginative and cutting-edge CGI work the MCU has ever seen. Surprise cameos and guest appearances generate whistle-worthy moments in the theatre and this is one movie you definitely don't want to miss watching on the big screen.The fact that the writers managed to tie in easter eggs from Wanda Vision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, Loki and even Hawkeye and set up things for upcoming Phase 4 villains while bringing in a completely difference Marvel-verse from a competing studio (no points for guessing) is nothing short of sheer brilliance.Despite the enormous set of content threads and characters director Jon Watts had to work with, he ably ensures each one gets requisite screen space and enough depth to make every performance in the film a memorable one.Ultimately, No Way Home is a fitting third act to the best Spiderman trilogy ever made. The villains continue to be what defines the classy MCU movies from the rest. While Tony Leung in Shang Chi and Willem Dafoe in No Way Home shone and captivated audiences, the fact that the Black Widow and Eternals did not resonate as much with audiences can be directly attributed to their lack of well-written, impactful antagonists.The villain-building should reach another level as we head deeper into Marvels Phase 4 with Oscar-nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor expanding on 'Karl Mordo' in Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness and Jonathan Majors returning as 'Kang the Conqueror' in Ant Man: Quantumania. But it is going to be Oscar winner Christian Bale's entry into the MCU as 'Gorr the God Butcher' in Thor: Love and Thunder that I am most looking forward to, combined with director Taika Waikiti's eccentric writing.No Way Home is a monumental piece of filmmaking and the best of the Marvel Phase 4 movies so far. Highly, highly recommended!", "spiderman no way home": "I thought the film was watchable for the most part it was a good film I think It did drag on a bit it was a long film It had a good story i did like when toby Maguire came back into it from the original spiderman and yes he is the one and only spiderman of all time wasnt really bothered about Andrew garfield the ending did disappoint me a bit when mj forgot totally about him.", "A treat for fans!": "What a superb tie together of the movies in the Spiderman franchise. Speaking as a fan who read the comic books as a child, I can only say that this is my favorite Spidy-movie to date.", "Great action movie": "If you like spider-man you will like this movie. My rating is high because im a fan. I saw spider-man, acting, directing and a great action. Fine by me. But i should say that the movie is a bit too long, comedy attempts arent that good and the story couldve been more logical.", "Great cast bad plot": "The hype to this movie was something else. Everyone thought they knew that Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire were in it but there was always that little doubt that they might not and we'd all leave the theater disappointed. The plot on the other hand was not good at all and when you think about it, most of the villains fates will be the same, depending on when they were brought to Tom Hollands universe. Seeing 3 Spidermen together onscreen was something else though. And Ned was absolutely hilarious.", "By Far The Best Spider-Man MCU Film": "Oh...my...God! Not only did this movie broke me, it delivered! I was skeptical about the whole Multiverse story, heard all the rumors and thought, \"Psh! That'll never happen!\". Boy, was I wrong!I have been a HUGE Spider-Man fan for at least 21 years. I fell in love with the character at the age of 4 because of the 90s cartoon. After finding out that he was a comic book character, I ended up going to the library almost every Saturday to go to the comic book section and read Spider-Man, which causes me to find other comics like Batman, Iron Man, Superman, Wonder Woman, etc. Because of Spider-Man, I became a comic book fan of DC and Marvel. This has been a dream of mine for a long time to see these amazing characters on the bug screen. What a time to be alive!This movie really stepped it up, making Homecoming and Far From Home the appetizer and entr\u00e9e. This film is the dessert that REALLY hits the spot. This is the most emotional we got from Tom Holland as Peter Parker and his chemistry between him, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon has definitely bloomed since Homecoming. Benedict Cumberbatch brings in the gravitas as Dr. Strange once again. I also like that he wasn't in it as much knowing that this is Spider-Man's movie. But the next best layer of this dessert is the villains.Alfred Molina, Willem Dafoe, Jamie Foxx, Thomas Hayden Church and Rhys Ifans coming back?! Sign me up! Especially seeing my boy Alfred come back for Doc Ock, because he was my favorite villain from the Raimi/Maguire films. I was definitely happy to see Willem back as Norman/Green Goblin because he is the definitive Norman Osborn I grew up on. Willem being the mask of Goblin is way better than what he was wearing in the 2002 film. I was never a fan of that Power Ranger mask, he's even creepier without it on, in example, this movie. Willem crushes it everytime when he was in the frame. That moment when Peter was fighting him and punching him in the face while Goblin is just laughing and smiling, that shows that Goblin is DEFINITELY Spider-Man's Joker. I am also glad we get some redemption for these characters as well because of how their stories ended with their death, except for Sandman and Lizard. My theory is that Sandman was from a later time after Spider-Man 3 and Lizard is.", "This spiderman movie might be one of the best\"MARVEL\" movies !": "Best Spider-Man movie out there and might be the best marvel movie out there(with endgame)!! This movie was so emotional, as it was happy, sad, and overall just a very highly emotional crowd-pleaser from start to finish.. The editing is decent and the music also really good. The story in Tom Holland Spider-Man is also really well done as he gets really good character development with themes that are decently presentedI recommend this movie, great movie:)", "Spider man: No way home": "2021\n12A\nDirector: Jon Watts\nStarring: Tom Holland, Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei and a few other surprises.With Spider Man's identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange for help. When a spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear, forcing Peter to discover what it truly means to be spider man. Wow, this was everything I wanted it to be and more.The cinematography of this film was beautiful. It was hilarious with some brilliant comedy. The set up was strong with introducing all the different antagonists. With some fantastic plot development with Peter and his relationships with MJ, Ned and aunt May, plus the fallout from far from home. The cameos and guest appearances from all of the different generations of villains was just amazing to see. The chemistry between the cast was incredibly strong. There was a lot of interesting elements involving the multiverse and the villains with how they reacted to being in this new world that was well explored. The action was incredibly strong, and the character conflict was excellent. With some fantastic performances. This was Tom Hollands and Zendaya's strongest performances yet with these characters. I also have to praise Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molino who were all fantastic. With Green Goblin being the strongest villain, he was terrifying.The character development of Peter Parker was excellent, he grew so much and matured as he took on the responsibilities of his actions and accepted the consequences. This film has a lot of emotional weight and it was surprising with the amount of emotional beats it had. The fan service was just amazing, it was so nostalgic to have three generations of villains back. The final act was also particularly incredible, and both the end credit scenes are amazing. My only slight nit-pick would be that there was some pacing inconsistencies in the first half as they had to fit a lot of plot in such a short space of time.But overall, Spider Man No Way Home is a cinematic event. Its visually stunning and emotionally satisfying. Packed full of strong action and amazing performances. And is truly a film for the fans, and top tier MCU, perhaps even in their top 3 strongest.Overall score 98/100.", "A fun ride but let's stop with villains can be saved": "I enjoyed it but there was a plot point that I absolutely hated. It didn't completely kill it for me just a bit overused and illogical. I give it 8/10.", "It's a love letter to the fans.": "Let me start by saying it is one of the best movies in the MCU. Almost everything about this movie is great. There's not a single thing that is bad in it. It has a great timing of humor, well acted, and the best use of characters that were once misintroduced.In some of the previous spiderman movies, certain characters were introduced badly and didn't get the right opportunity to show their potentials. In this one, they are redeemed.The tune of this movie is far better than the previous ones. Homecoming was better than far from home. But this one is on another level. It has, without spoiling \ud83d\ude02, everything the fans were hoping to see and it delivers in a big way.", "A historic crossover, if somewhat unintelligible to newcomers (2021 list excerpt)": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is a cinematic culmination that rivals 2018's Avengers: Infinity War, satisfying three generations of geek (though mostly two). There is much to scrutinize about the rules and world-building consistency here (even if we ignore the three different film universes it needs to stay congruent with, the plot on its own has some holes), but in terms of pay-off and fanservice -- in its most genuine, loving kind -- it is absolutely wondrous.For an MCU movie, it's also remarkably well-shot and well-acted. Tom Holland and Zendaya have better chemistry here than ever before, Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe are utterly wonderful as their classic Spider-Man baddies, Jamie Foxx's character from the Garfield era is vastly improved, and Marisa Tomei gets some genuinely tear-jerking moments. I didn't feel strongly about Benedict Cumberbatch in this movie (least of all his cringe-tacular Scooby-Doo quip), but rest assured, you will see him elsewhere on my list.As nonsensical as some of the story beats are when you muse upon in-universe logistics even one little bit, this might just be the most emotionally strong out of all the MCU flicks thus far. As you'll see on my runners-up list, I don't think it's strictly better than films like Quo Vadis Aida or The Last Duel, but I bring it up here because it sets a good precedent and signifies something special within the superhero genre.", "#SaveDaredevil": "9/10 just for bringing Daredevil and Tobey back. #SaveDaredevil .. Oh, and for the scene where Andrew's Spiderman saves MJ. Point deducted for trying to get us to believe that Dr. Strange would poorly plan and execute a spell and for doing a memory wipe.", "I basically smiled all the way through": "POSITIVES:1) The film does a great job of tackling issues that are key to the character of Spider Man, such as responsibility and always being a good person. The way Doctor Strange and Spider-Man have conflict with each other regarding the issues of the film was really interesting and engaging\n2) The action scenes are shot really well and the direction in general is very good\n3) I thought the script was really clever and went in directions that I wasn't expecting, with very good payoffs and character arcs for basically every character. It works brilliantly emotionally too\n4) Finally, of course, the return of all of the characters and actors from previous Spider-Man films was incredible. They're not just brought back for cheap fan service, they actually all have their own arcs and their own scene stealing moments. Alfred Molina, Willem Dafoe, Jamie Foxx, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire were all fantastic and added depth to their characters. It was really exciting see Charlie Cox back as Matt Murdock too, even if it was just briefly\n5) Despite being two and a half hours long, the film never felt long and the time absolutely flies overNEGATIVES:1) Ned and MJ just annoy me. Admittedly, Peter's final moments with MJ were touching, but in general they're meant to just be humorous characters but I don't find them funny\n2) Lizard and Sandman felt sidelined and irrelevant. They don't even get any speaking lines once they turn back human at the end\n3) The previous Spider-Man series's had humour in them, but it wasn't MCU style humour. In this film, the returning characters all use MCU style humour, but it just feels odd and out of place for these characters to be using this style of humour. It started to get on my nerves.", "Treat for superhero fans": "This film is even better than Homecoming. It takes action choreography and storytelling to the next level and delivers every bit of the Spidey fun fans needed. Tom Holland as Spider-Man does a great job as usual, but Jake Gyllenhaal as Mysterio truly impresses big time. I can call it one of the best action films of the year so far.The film was so fast paced that when an hour passed away and the cinemas placed a random intermission, my first reaction was, \"What? Why so early?\" It was when I looked at the time I realized that an hour had gone already, and the film was so gripping that I didn't even feel the need to leave my seat. The second half went on to intensify with a couple of very serious moments, but also present were the heroic elevations that made the viewer not just cheer for Spidey but also feel that yes! He should fight and save the day!", "Over hyped": "I was expecting so much more than that. People were saying it was better than \"End Game\". Not even close. At best the green goblin as usual stands out. Everything else was par at best, including the plot.", "Just another Disney rollercoaster of jokes.": "This is exactly the same formula that Disney used in the whole MCU. Fun action scenes (and i said fun, no great), 80% jokes, and a little of actual drama. The narrative is messy as always in this movies, and the characters are just like the NPC's from any open world game, \"doing stuff\" so the story goes on. No way this film has any action scenes as well choreographed, or a dramatic arc, like in Spiderman 2.If you are an over emotional teenager that screams in the theaters when seeing an MCU film, you may have an orgasmic experience. But if you're an adult that loved Tobey's Spiderman 20 years ago, you may get entertained, and you may smile when he appears, but no more than that. The MCU is a circus, and every character in it is a clown that will do anything to get you entertain, very often with no logic in it.", "Forced at times, but overall very satisfying and fulfilling.": "SPOILER FREE.This is an extremely difficult movie to talk about without going into any spoilers. But I'll give it a shot.Having been excited and extremely hyped up for this movie (just like the rest of the world) for the last 7 months, I went in with extraordinarily high expectations. What I can say is, happily, those expectations were met and even sometimes surpassed. More or less everything you'd expect from a good spider-man movie is here, and then some. As I said, this is tough to talk about without mentioning plot.Given that If i could mention spoilers here, I could sit and gush about this movie for hours and hours, about all of the ways it is great. But that isn't possible. So instead, I'll let my previous words suffice for the praise I give this movie, and I will move on to what I didn't like, as it is somewhat easier to be extremely vague and subtle when criticising the movie. Whereas praising is nigh impossible at the moment. So, the plot.The plot seems, to me, to be spread extremely thin in places. The reasons given for the things happening in the story are pretty darn weak at times. There are contrivances, and they do sort of stick out. But only for a brief time, because the next scene could have you grinning from ear to ear having forgotten all about said contrivance. However, this doesn't change the fact that some of this feels messy. The movie comes across as being EXTREMELY desperate to get to a certain point, and it suffers for it slightly. Given the run time, the fact we're still rushing here is disappointing.I suppose It's praise worthy that the movie is able to make you roll your eyes in one scene, at a particularly forced moment or plot point, and in the next moment, have you giggling with a child-like glee, seeing things you only ever wished you'd see in the past. And that truly is the strength of this movie. Without spoiling, the magic here is what has been pulled off. 'Pulled off' being an important coupling of words. Because that is essentially what has happened here, to the credit of everybody involved. It has been pulled off, and is ALMOST the best superhero movie ever made to date now. Certainly the best Marvel effort, second only to Iron Man 1 possibly.I can't really say much more, as much as I really want to just rip this one apart and spill the insides out for you all, It'd be wrong.Just go see this one guys. Trust me. 9/10.", "is this the best superhero movie ever?": "It could very well be...I literally cannot believe what I just watched. I\u00b4m in pure awe. Two years of tremendous and unbelievably high expectations, and somehow Marvel still managed to completely surpass anything I could have ever dreamt of.It\u00b4s the most entertaining and at the same time most brutal and emotional Spider-Man movie ever! The writing is ridiculously good. Feels like they brought the best bits of everything Spider-Man related from comics and media all in one movie. The stakes are as high and real as they\u00b4ve ever beenTom Holland delivers his finest, most meaningful and moving performance as Peter Parker.No Way Home understands the Spider-Man character like no Spider-Man film before it.Spider-Man No Way Home ushers in a whole new era for the MCU. They have reached another level, risen above their previous benchmarks and there is no going back. Spectacular. Amazing!This film is a masterpiece like i have rarely seen before.I want to end this little review with just saying thank you.Thank you Marvel, thank you Sony. Thank you John Watts and thank you Kevin Feige. You all listened to the fans and delivered us a movie for the history books, that will be cheered about for decades to come.", "What Poor Choice Can Spider-Child Make Next?": "The film was entertaining. But man did it have a lot of crying scenes. It felt like 30 minutes was dedicated to people crying on the screen. Other than that, Spider-Man makes so many child like decisions you're left wondering why an adult figure (Dr Strange) doesn't be more firm with him. But the CGI, graphical scences, etc looked really phenomenal. Not one of Marvel's best, but it was a good enough for a viewing.", "Good, fun, nostalgia, and well done, but didn't deserve a 9 or 10 to me": "I think the title speaks by itself, i would watch it again, but probably not by my choice, a lot of random things happen, for me the best part of the movie is Dr. Strange and see 3 spidermans, and the \"tragic incident thats hits our holland spidy\", but the whole movie isn't really great.", "Solid Spider-Man Entry": "Not perfect but as good as a superhero film gets. Tom Holland is his usual charming self as Peter Parker. Just how long can baby faced Tom continue to play a 17 year old, some time yet I would say.As a big fan of the Sam Raimi era I loved seeing more from Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina as their respective bad guys.Long film but it didn't drag which is always a good sign. Hopefully this will reignite the box office.", "For fans of Spider-Man in Film": "This movie fulfilled the wishes of any fan of past sole Sony Spider-Man film to the extreme, and exceeded them to the point it's hard to believe that these events actually happened.It is a beautiful joyride of a movie, filled with emotion, heart, closure, beautiful, pitch perfect action choreography, stunning shots and the celebration of the legacy of Spider-Man. The hype was real.", "Got to be kidding me if it's over 8. Messy mashup": "What took five movies to defeat villians were defeated by cooking up something in lab within five minutes, it makes all previous movies pointless.Just a bizarre attempt to create a nostalgic experience for Spidey fans.As all Tom Holland Spidey movies, entertaining first half followed by cringe climax.", "The biggest movie of the year fails to satisfy fully": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is undoubtedly the most hyped movie of this year and it's ambitions are quite high. Now Spider-Man fans will love this movie, it is what I call a \"fan service\" film which is the reason why it may fall flat for regular movie goers.The main problem of this movie is the fact that you can guess most things that'll happen, now this may not be a bad thing but when the most hyped up film of the year has a less than amazing and guessable plot you feel kind of disappointed. Also Spider-Man couldn't be any stupider, I won't spoil anything but all of his decisions are guessable and extremely dumb for the most part. Now let's talk a little bit about the goods because this movie isn't bad, the main highlight is the visuals, the film has inception-like scenes and it's a feast for the eyes. The actors also do their job and seeing Willem Dafoe without his usual green goblin mask is a great addition, his villainous face was wasted under that piece of metal.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fine movie overall, Spider-Man fans will probably love it but I would still recommend it to regular movie goers or people wanting to know what the hype is about, 7/10.", "BPM over 9000": "I can't believe how this movie CAME THROUGH. I'm lost for words and can't describe it any better. Everything I expected, wanted, needed, thought i needed. I got it. And hopefully. So did everyone else. I firmly believe this movie didn't betray anyone with huge expectations. Willem Dafoes' performance was peak level. As a huge Spider-Man fan I loved to see him and Doc Ock deliver.", "I liked the movie, but yet again there's something off.": "The movie was great. It's such a shame it was rumored that much, it ruined the surprise element. How cool would it have been if we didn't know about the previous villains and the rumored appearance of the previous spidermans? Anyway, I want to talk about something that I feel since a long time.I'm a die hard fan of Sam Raimi trilogy. Was it accurate according to the comics? No. Was the movie a whole different vibe? Yes. I love the MCU thing and the fact that everything's connected, but I feel like this whole connection make every movie less \"singular\" but more of an episode of a tv series. Also, I liked the horror and dark vibes the previous Spidermans gave me. Here it's focused too much in being funny and this doesn't help me feeling sad or happy about something. When uncle Ben died in the first spiderman movie, it was really moving IMO and I could feel the revenge. Here, when May died, i couldn't feel anything because all the memories I have of her is just comic stuff and no real connection.Also I didn't really like the CGI. Lizard was awful, it really looked like coming from some old 3d cartoons.I know I'm probably gonna be hated for all this, but this whole MCU connection and the fact that they try to make every movie funny in some ways, it makes me feel less connected to each movie and feel less epic then how it was before. I may liked it more when everything was disconnected, darker and every movie was one only story.", "The best tom Holland spider man": "Warning: Spoilers\nIt's hard to discuss this movie and not get into the spoilers because the biggest moments of this movie necessitate ruining several of the big reveals. I loved that not everything was in the trailer and I successfully avoided reading too much about the film, which helped my enjoyment. This was the first movie I've seen in a theater since Halloween Kills, so the risk of COVID-19 and all its variants didn't keep me away* from the biggest movie of the year.This movie arrives as so many older directors gatekeep what constitutes a movie. So let me break down my opinion: movies can be anything you want them to be. There is equal room for a high end Oscar contender as there is for the junk low end world that I live in, the places where Godfrey Ho, Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei make their home.What else are comic book movies other than classical myths made with computers and no small amount of sound and fury? So yeah, this is the 27th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie and you know, you don't have to watch these movies. Hollywood -- the world -- is still making something for everyone. But for crowd-pleasing moments, the two biggest I've heard in years are when Captain America lifted Mjolnir and when one of the characters arrived in this film, a literally explosion of happiness and joy from an audience that has weathered so much in the last two years.And isn't that why movies exist? To make us feel something?No movie that I have seen in a theater in nearly a decade has elicited that emotional outburst and you know, it brought true joy to my heart. So I didn't feel silly expressing my emotions, whether they were happy when a certain legal professional made his presence known or the sadness of Dr. Strange's final words to Peter Parker.Spider-Man has always lived by the lesson that with great power comes great responsibility. He's a character informed -- in every incarnation -- by a great loss that he was at fault for and a lifetime of making up for that mistake.Yet Spider-Man: No Way Home presents us with something new. Great power with responsibility also means being better than your enemies and at times, working to make them better people and not just punching them into oblivion. The fact that antagonists can be worth saving spoke to me, someone usually given to mad revenge schemes and years of grudges. Even when doing the right thing ends up hurting you, you still can do the right thing.These are big concepts for a comic book spectacle. And this movie does what all great films should. It's stuck in my mind since I saw it and I wanted some time away from it before I wrote this. Spider-Man is the story of a bully grown up and moving past the way he was treated, often finding those bullies -- Flash Thompson, Eddie Brock -- become if not friends, certainly no longer enemies.This also gets into the Marvel idea of a multiverse, a connected web of other realities where small differences -- Disney+ set this up with What If...? And this idea will form the heart of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- but the main part of this story remains refreshingly human in the midst of big ideas, strange science and concepts like how magic works.Look -- I don't have to sell you on these movies. They make so much money that they're critic proof. But I do want you to consider that even if you hate superhero movies, even if you think there are too many of them, to consider your favorite film series. What if you had more than three of the original Star Wars films and they all were progressively better? What if the last Jason, Freddy or Hellraiser movie was so much better than the original? What if James Bond got more human, more relevant and more real as the world around him became even stranger?That's what's happening here. And it's amazing.*I'm triple vaxxed, beyond fastidious about mask wearing and personal space, and rarely if ever leave my movie basement. This isn't a political statement. Viruses don't have politics and if you think they do, you can kindly never read another word that I write.", "Celebration.": "This is a very good superheroe movie.It's well written, it makes Tom Holland's Spiderman evolve and gives it a very good motive. It's also well implemented in the universe, may have some plot holes but, overall, it doesn't really matter.There's a lot of fanservice, but we wanted it, and also the humor may be a little bit annoying in some scenes.But, this is an incredible event and experience.

There were some good bits, but it just took too long to get to them. The whole storyline was completely nonsensical from the moment Holland's immensely irritating Peter Parker somehow convinced Strange to help him out. Everything that happened subsequently needen't have happened.The attempts at humour fell completely with me, which normally isn't the case for me with Marvel films over the years. The runtime also had me squirming in my seat checking my watch... At least 30mins could EASILY have been shaved off the running time to make things tighter.", "Really good buuuut...": "I really enjoyed the movie, the cameos and surprises the movie had made me smile and shout but one thing I really didn't like was that at serious moments or moments that should be serious, there are tons and tons of jokes.

The film's special effects are top-notch, immersing the audience in a visually stunning and believable world.The film also delivers on its emotional impact, with Peter Parker facing the weight of his responsibilities as Spider-Man and the consequences of his actions.

There's weight to every action he takes in a way not as present in any of the prior MCU Spidey movies, making this one stand out from the rest.The movie works as well as it does because the cast behind it puts on an incredible performance as well. One minute there's humor and the next we're having a serious conversation and the actors pull those tone switches off phenomenally.Maybe the pacing could have been better, and maybe there are a few plot holes (how much they matter is debatable) that later on I questioned.

How do you deal with being the most famous person when you were living so comfortably as a nobody before, and how does it affect the superhero activities?3,) What do you do with a huge inheritance when before you were constantly broke? (not a new question, but a new answer is needed, after the desater that happened in Far From Home)\nI was looking forward to creative, inspiring answers to all of these questions.Instead we get the smartest characters doing the most stupid things, just to create a new problem, and almost the entire runtime goes into dealing with that.

Actually two, so our family is hoping Marvel will not corrupt Spider-Man with bad words and inappropriate behaviors like the ones shown on those two characters series.Marvel - Don't get desperate to please everyone.

Now, Peter, MJ & Ned got rejection from MIT for ongoing situation and there Peter sees kind of Doctor Strange decorative and decides to ask him for help. When Doctor Strange was casting the spell, Peter couple of times interrupted and it opened the Multiverse portal through which every villain knows who the Peter Parker is, are coming to this universe. So, it is now Peter asks help from MJ & Ned to capture them and send them to their universe.There are many leaks out but I would suggest to avoid those and experience this marvel in theatre only. As a story point of view, it was not the best to come out from Holland's trilogy but it has been executed and delivered so brilliantly that in the end you will love it.There is no doubt that this will be considered as best Spider-Man Live action movie yet because of so many things which are there in the movie. But for me what makes it best is finally a Holland's Spider-Man film we got where he truly understands the responsibilities by taking things on his own and how being a superhero can cost so many things as you move forward.Verdict: Whether you're Tobey's fan or Andrew's fan or Tom's fan, doesn't matter, watch it for our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.", "The perfect blend": "I didn't think even MCU would be able to pull off so masterfully a movie with so many different characters, many of whom will need to be reintroduced, but they really did!Somehow, they managed to do most of them justice, while not taking away from the story, while giving fan service, while making it compelling, while universe-building, while setting up future plots. It also mixed Spidey-like lighthearted humor with really touching, emotional moments without taking away from the gravity of the emotion, and that is simply masterful.", "Is this a spoof?": "I get that the nostalgia is appealing, but watching this I felt like it was some charity film where all the actors come back because they're paid a substantial sum.

Not very creative at all which is a crime when we have ALL THE SPIDERMEN of our generations..The plot is just silly. Too silly. Peter Parker is a dufus. Strange is incredibly arrogant and dumb after endgame. It's just weird. Utterly dissapointed how marvel could do this to us. Lazy project.

But luckily I didn't pay for it, my friend did. SO... whatever. It's one of those annoying movies that could have been over in the first act, and logically should have been.The Initial Incident:\nIt forces you to suspend your disbelief way too much. It's coming from a contradictory position, it wants to have childish naive Parker but also wants to have war-harden Parker and that's why it doesn't work. The premise is, after everyone finds out that Peter is Spider-Man, his life sucks. SO enter the selfish child side wanting to make everyone forget he's Spider-Man. Thus Dr. Strange steps in. He uses his magic to erase everyone's memory, in an attempt to be a very fun and comedic scene, but got annoying. Peter's greed causes a problem. And all the worlds collide blah blah blah. And the rest of the movie devolves from there.The issues:\n-Peter's a genius, Peter has seen war, Peter has literally witnessed death and rebirth, Peter in this Movie knows all of that. BUT at the same time, if we used that knowledge the movie doesn't happen. As it probably shouldn't have. SO... Peter is now Pre-End Game Peter, in some scenes, a kid messing around with his powers. Still wide-eyed and bushy tailed. Since manufactured conflict is fun, manufactured tear-jerkers are fun.-Dr. Octavius, what did they do to him? Did they not watch that Spider-Man movie? Now he's got like a weird Just for Men dyed black hair and it's like slightly curly. When in the original it's a bowl cut and clearly BROWN and STRAIGHT. I don't know if that's Alfred's real hair and for whatever reason they didn't want to or he said no to them straightening it and dying it brown. I don't know, it looked bad and off.-\"This is all my fault...\" Realization; yeah no crap Sherlock, hey he's in this movie too as Dr. Strange, look at me tying it all together. REFERENCES. RARELY IF EVER has this been done well. Most of the time it's enraging. And this is that movie. Yes, everything here is because you were written terribly, and they made your character into an idiot, that they somehow thought was MIT worthy (and given recent events from that school, it's not the prestigious college it used to be). So there's one big scene that's supposed to be super sad and emotional and I just couldn't feel anything but annoyance. Also these movies have a weird and disgusting need to manipulate the famous Uncle Ben line; The Andrew Garfield one was slightly different and then this series is slightly different as well. STOP MESSING WITH A SIMPLE AND GREAT QUOTE.-The \"message\" rears its ugly head here and there, and gets annoying but not terrible. MJ is still the poorly written character that should have been done better, since I like the actress you can tell she's got that something. Ned is always annoying in all of these, and I get that's his role but it's terrible, it's the worst comic relief character I've seen in a while. Neither MJ or Ned show off their intelligence in this movie. AT least MJ shows it off in 2 but Ned never does. We just assume smart because asian? Also, always hated this series diversity hire Flash Thompson. SERIOUSLY. For how woke these movies can get, that's the perfect time to put a white guy in a comic foil role. Instead you get someone who looks NOWHERE NEAR a \"flash thompson\" and is terrible at acting in his role.The good:\n-New Electro, he was written amazingly well. All the villains were, only issue was Alfred's look was off and they over-de-aged him. Green goblin also looked sketchy in a bad digital de-aging way. Also there's literally a scene of him on the glider and his face literally smears into position, after the climax and emotional moment of it.-I actually liked that all the spider-men were there and they did well. Tobey's almost 50 yikes and it shows. Couldn't use the digital Vaseline on Tobey, but Dr. Oc gets it? And near the end the it was kind of nice and there was a MINOR MINOR justification for the BS and illogical catalyst.Conclusion:It's not offensive, it ends on a whimper like Spider-Man 3 did over a decade before it. Relies too much on nostalgia, fan service, and suspension of disbelief from this version of Spider-Man and that's what annoyed me. Almost as much as them apparently reviving the dead HTC One/vibe(???) phone line that MJ is using in this movie. That's like 10 years old now. I think my favorite moment watching this at my friends house was at the end. It opens to a panning shot and all you see at the start is the top of a tree. And I was like: \"they're at a...\" And my friend was mad at me for making assumptions based on just the top of a tree. The point of the story is; cliched symbolism is obvious. Also remember the spell was; \"make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man\". Yeah they seemed to forget the specifics of that request and messed it up in the end. I might have to watch it again, to see if the second attempt to execute the spell that the stipulations were different. SO... only the 2nd act is redeemable but the first and third are kind of terrible. If you can get it for free or con a friend to buy it for you, then do that. SINCE it is not worth the ticket price. $6 to rent, yeah I'd say that's okay.", "Spider-Man: No way of not eating your cake too. 72.5%?": "Following on the from the ending of the previous film in this series, \"Spider-Man: Far from home\" (which I've reviewed here), where the identity of Spider-Man is revealed to the world, we see Peter Parker/Spider-Man wish that that wasn't the case. As they say, be careful of what you wish for. Dr. Strange has some unkind words to say about Parker in the aftermath of this but what's that saying about people who live in glass houses? Did Peter subject the good Doctor to peer pressure to get what he wanted? Did Strange want to be one of the \"cool kids\" by giving Peter what he wanted? Anyway, bad things happen as a result and they need to be fixed. Apparently granting people their wish allows illegal aliens without the correct documentation to enter from multiverses into our own world.As I said in my review for the previous film (not having the seen the one prior to that, which was the 3rd reboot of the Spider-Man franchise, I believe), I didn't find it a satisfying film until near the end and that ending made me curious to see the next entry, which I've done. It's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again this time, as whilst I didn't find that this new film was as bad as the previous one was (for the most part), it did end in such a way that I was sort of curious to see the next entry in the series as well as the other MCU films which are promoted in the closing credits. These are the kinds of film that I don't really feel happy about paying top dollar to see them at the cinema. If there was a day of the week where you could watch a film cheaply at the cinema, it could be do-able for me. Cheaper than that. I'd settle for seeing it on the non-commercial ABC TV network in Australia, or a summary of the happenings in a Tweet.\"Spider-Man: No way home\" is better for not having that 'awkward teenage romance' aspect of the previous film but the way that it dealt with Peter Parker's identity as Spider-Man being revealed just didn't grab me. Maybe I would have preferred a more domestic focus on the impact this has on Peter but then again, maybe the way that it is handled in the film is fair enough. After that stuff is resolved - and I'm not even sure that it is resolved in a way that makes sense, as in it makes sense why Parker is no longer a hunted target - the film focuses on providing fan service to long-time devotees of this character's forays into film. You'll see familiar villains return as a result of Parker's wish, which he'll have to deal with in one way or another.I might have mentioned in a previous review for a Spider-Man film or elsewhere online that I thought it was ridiculous how many reboots this franchise has had in such a short space of time. Maybe I should have waited for the next actor to play Spider-Man to find one that I can enjoy an entire series of films with? Maybe this whole \"multiverse\" conceit makes that more possible? E.g. You could have dozens of Spider-Man films being released each year with different actors in all of them. Anyway, it's ironic that multiverse 'logic' has the post facto effect of making all those previous iterations of Spider-Man seem as some sort of 'grand plan' by Marvel Studios. With these kinds of fantasies I like to imagine that the superhero inhabits OUR world. With the multiverse, it's a case of: \"Oh, so we're watching a film set in some OTHER universe\". If I was to see a new actor play Spider-Man in the future and it had the conceit of being set in our world (until a later sequel?), it would devalue the story of the Spider-Man in this film (S-M:NWH) being OUR Spider-Man.That being said, I think that long-time devotees of this cinematic character will enjoy the fan service that this film provides. When this happens, some of the exchanges between characters are fun and you're glad that those questions are asked or whatever. However, I do feel that the writers could have spent a bit more time thinking about what kinds of conversations could have been had and writing those down, perhaps in a quieter setting too, so that the viewer could dwell on them. Years ago I said on an online forum or somewhere that I wondered if or why Peter Parker didn't weave a 'brown web of justice', referring to the physiology of spiders. That topic gets brought up in this film, albeit less crudely than I put it.How to score this film? I'd say that I was leaning on a score of 70% but the fan service later on in the film made me decide on 72.5%. However, with these kinds of films, I think that my scores which are around the 70% mark might be more like a professional critic's 60% score. In that case, maybe I should score this film 65% (but 6 out of 10 stars on IMDB) or 65+% (to get 7 out of 10 stars on this site according to my scoring system)? Take your pickNotes to self:* There's an 'interesting' scene where a surprise visitor meets Ned's mum (?) and they recognise one another, it seems to me. My question is: what effect does that have on the 'reality' of the world we are seeing? Does it even make sense anymore? If they do recognise each other, then looks like a logical loophole, it seems to me, in the film's world-building. The same sequence has another inexplicable moment, when someone says \"They're not your friends\" and action ensues. I have no idea what that was all about either.* There's a line in the closing credits which reads something like: \"Avi Arad the original true believer\". I see that that person is the executive producer of this film so it would be interesting to know the background to that assertion.* I'm not so personally invested in this series to get excited about some of the surprises that this film had in store but it didn't sound like anyone else in the cinema was that much of a superfan either to get THAT excited. However, I do concede that I found some of those moments of interaction to have emotional gravity which was well conveyed by the actors concerned.", "Bingo.": "Well that lived up to the hype. Look, I want to see more of the other actors and less of the current actor. Marvel take a hint and make it happen. My thing is, this movie is awesome but it makes you miss the old stuff. I am just going to come out and say it; I do not like Tom Holland's Spiderman.", "The Best Portrayal of Spider-Man In The MCU So Far": "As much as I think Tom Holland is a capable actor, I'd be lying if I didn't say that I've had some issues with his incarnation of Spider Man. He's always given great performances and he is undoubtably the most comic accurate version of the character but my recurring issue with Spider Man in the MCU is that he just never seems to be able to fully stand on his own. Both of his solo films heavily revolve around Tony Stark and in his other appearances he's been a smaller part in a larger whole. Despite all that however I was (like everyone) so excited for this film and the possibilities it could bring even if there was the risk of it relying too heavily on fan service and nostalgia as opposed to a solid story. But I have to say that this film really lived up to the hype and managed to use its fan service in the best possible manner to create for a film that was endlessly enjoyable, thrilling and surprisingly emotional.As I said, I've had my issues with this version of Peter Parker but I have to say I think he's the best he's ever been in No Way Home. I really liked how Watts and the writers didn't simply brush over the consequences of the last film. They spend a great deal of time exploring Peters life in the wake of his identity being revealed to the world and it allows you to fully understand and sympathise with his predicament before any of the fan service elements kick in. While Doctor Strange plays a key role in the film I never felt as though the film was relying on him too much. He shows up more sporadically than I was expecting and I think that ultimately worked in the films favour as it never felt as though he was showing up any more than he needed to and I didn't think they sacrificed any moments for him that should've been more about Peter. The film also ended in a way that I wasn't expecting and it was surprisingly emotional. I didn't think they kept things status quo for his character and they left things of in a way that I'm more excited than ever to see where they go with his character next.I think this film succeeds more with its characters than both of the previous Holland movies but also more than most MCU films. While Peter gets his own satisfying arc I also thought all the supporting characters got their own moments to shine. Aunt May has been a repeated source of missed opportunities in this trilogy for me but I think the character is the best she's been since the Raimi films. She gets a lot of intense, emotional scenes with Peter and actually plays a much larger part in the story than I was expecting. Her arc concludes in a very unexpected and emotional place that added a lot to this film beyond just being light and entertaining. Ned and MJ also get a lot to do in this film beyond just being funny sidekicks, their connection to Peter is what drives a lot of the story and again adds that extra layer of emotion that was sorely missing in Far From Home and quite a few other marvel films. A lot of other Spider Man films have been criticised for having too many villains and whole this film ran the risk of repeating that same mistake I ultimately felt they were all used fantastically. It's great to see so many of these actors returning to these roles and I loved that they included scenes of them interacting with one and other, they all had great chemistry and it was nice to see these vastly different characters bounced of each other. I think they all got their individual moments to shine but I do think some of them get lost in the shuffle a little bit, personally I'd like to have seen a little bit more time devoted to Sandman and Lizard.I think one of the biggest praises I can give to this film is the excellent way in which it uses fan service. I think the film did a great job of first and foremost setting up a solid story first that lent itself to that fan service well. As a result none of it really stuck out at all and instead felt like a natural part of the story they were telling. As a long time spider man fan there were many obvious moments that gave me chills but also plenty of subtle ones I picked up on and I'm sure there's plenty more to find when I watch the film again.I suppose one of my only issues with No Way Home is that it can feel a bit messy in places. The film's clearly trying to juggle a lot of plot points and characters and I think particularly the 2nd act can feel the most uneven. It just feels like it has to stall somewhat to set up all these returning characters and it did meander in places for me. I think the film also suffers from some of the recurring tropes that the MCU is known for, namely the massive use of humour that's become a staple of this franchise. I think it's because this film revolves around so many characters set up in other franchises, that some of these tropes don't always fit quite so smoothly and it does stick out as a bit forced in places. Having said that though it does use these tropes better than a lot of other marvel films and especially Far From Home which I thought sacrificed almost every single emotional or character moments for the sake of a joke.I'm so glad that No Way Home lived up to my expectations. Tom Holland's version of Spider Man is better than he's ever been, the fan service is used in appropriate ways with a good story to support it, none of the supporting characters or villains feel wasted and it ends in such a well rounded, satisfying way. It's a bit messy in places and it could've dialled back on that typical marvel humour but that doesn't take away too much from a film that is just so much fan to watch with a surprising amount of emotion. For the first time I'm actually very excited to see where this version of the web slinger goes next.9.0/10 - A (Phenomenal)", "10 Stars Across The Multiverse": "I like how they tied it all together.

He doesn't seem to have learned a thing despite being in a maelstrom of betrayal, destruction and death over the course of 4-5 Marvel movies.It was nice to see old characters. It was kinda sad they dumbed down Dr. Strange to advance the silly storyline (but hey, they gotta break the universe to get all their multiverse movies going...I just wish they did it more intelligently).Anyway, it'll pass the time.

Why why why, Marvel your going down the DC route of made movies, sort it out.", "It works, it's good, but it could have been better...": "Walking into this movie, I had two main concerns. First, if the previous two Spidermen are really in the movie and second if this multiverse thing will work.To my surprise, both were done right! Tobey and Andrew are there in full action and you can't get enough of them. The multiverse also works in a believable and as logical as possible way.The problems that bothered me the most were the pacing, some of the acting and some immersion breaking funny scenes.Starting with the pacing, the movie is too long and it drags at times. Of course there are a lot of things happening but I felt myself being bored at some scenes, while wishing others had been given more time. The first part is boring, things start to get better when Dr. Strange casts the spell, then another big boring part with Peter tries to catch and then to redeem all the bad guys and the movie gets a lot better after May's death.I found the scenes between Holland, Zendaya and Batalon being way too many and immersion breaking. Like \"ok lets stop the movie for a minute to say the same things we said 10 minutes ago about friendship, morality etc\"... Ok we got it, it's all about friendship... I don't know if Zendaya is a good actress or not, but I feel she was a bit wooden in this one. And Batalon is limited to comic relief.Holland is great though and so is Cumberbatch.About the bad guys, we get a solid performance from Dafoe and Molina, especially Dafoe, but Jamie Fox feels different from his character in the respective film. Honestly, he feels more like MF Jones from Horrible Bosses, rather than Max Dillon.Also, I cant believe that before the great final battle, the 3 Spidermen are casualy chatting about their enemies and that the director thought that a scene where one Spiderman is stretching the other's back is necessary.The final battle great and all, but at times it was hard to distinguish the Spidermen and it was a little bit too chaotic for my taste.The humour is there in big amounts and in wrong places. For example, when Andrew's Spidey appears, it is ok to have the funny moment where MJ and Ned test him, it is funny when Ned's grandma asks him to wipe the spider from the ceiling, but it is not funny when the grandma starts talking in her language for 30 seconds straight.I undesrstand that these movies are mostly for teen and young audiences, but I feel that even them werent impressed with all these shifts between light and dark tone.", "Comic movies are back": "With the last several years of comic movies really failing to bring something new to the screen, this one does just about everything right.

After watching it I felt sad, as if someone stole something from me. In this case all the buildup from two previous movies, character development, etc. One of the worst endings in a movie ever!The foundations of the film are weak - all happens due to a spell... how does the spell work actually? Why Strange did not talk it through with Peter before going to the basement and playing with magic??? He was supposed to be a genius, right? Why did the spell broke the way it broke, and why was it possible to repair it by making everyone forget who Peter is (not just Peter as Spiderman)? Like... whaaaat?Another thing, Peter is young, wants to to good and help people. He makes bad decisions, sure, but the movie tells you that wanting the help other will make your life misarable (first his friends and the spell happens, then the bad guys and May dies,then everyone... so spell happens again and everyone forgets) so just take care of yourself and do not mind anyone else.There were good scenes, the nostalgia of three Spiders was nice, some good humour too. But humour does not fit well to a movie wit such an ending. Make up your mind, what kind of movie are you making? Comedy? Drama?From a \"technical\" perspective this is a great movie. But from a script writing point of view it is a catastrophe.

Would no one ever happen to see as Spiderman flies into or out of his home window? Isn't it a security risk that everyone is just using plain smartphones to communicate all the time? Etc. I don't know, it doesn't sit me well to target this already weak and blurry area and blow a main plot drive out of it.There's already a Spiderman movie about parallel dimensions, it's called Into the Spider-Verse. So this is not a very original idea even within the Spiderman world.Why did a spell that supposedly affects people's memory pull in entities from parallel realities again?Why does Peter uttering anything affect the spell Strange is casting anyway? It seems to me that his last interruption along the lines of \"just let anyone who knows Peter Parker is Spiderman retain that knowledge\" - was what caused the collapse of realities (again, why?). But Strange didn't even react to that, and it wasn't Peter who was casting the spell.Only after reading a few articles did I realize that the figures behind the collapsing sky were supposedly other super villains. I thought they were some kind of super-dimensional gods or something.If there are an infinite number of alternate realities then there should be an infinite number of Green Goblins for example. How come only one appeared?How did Peter and friends free the otherworldly prisoners from Strange's cells all by themselves???How did both Peter and his friend Ned know that the ring was used to open portals? Ned supposedly learned it by accident. But then why did he wear it in the first place? Why did Peter take it from Strange? Why doesn't Strange carry a bunch of spare pieces? If I were a wizard and my ability to open portals relied on the possession of a little brass ring, I'd surely make sure to have a couple of extra rings in my pocket.The loooong loooong dying scene of May was beyond cringe. It reminded me of that \"dying\" scene in Jim Carrey's Mask...I can accept that the arcane device is capable of reversing the botched spell. But why would casting a totally different memory-affecting spell reverse the effects??? Why don't the alternate-reality newcomers just stay in this world but now without any memory of Peter Parker???All in all it was lazy writing. If you're to touch such brain heavy subjects as alternate realities, you'd better show your work and think your plot through! I'm not looking for Primer-level thinking, but it'd be nice to at least reach that of Back to the Future.", "This is how you do fan service right": "There was a lot of fan service but it was done so well that it didn't have to rely on it to make the movie enjoyable to watch. My friend didn't even know half the people in it and still loved it. Great end to the trilogy and has a perfect Peter Parker ending.", "Everything we needed in a Spiderman movie!": "Say what you want about the old Spiderman movies, but this is by far the best Spiderman movie in 20 years. Andrew Garfield and Tobey Miguire reprising their role as Spiderman, is what we've been wanting to happen forever. This one absolutely nailed it!", "Fun multiversal mayhem that plays on nostalgia and callbacks.": "After the effect on his friends when Spider-Man's true identity is revealed, Peter Parker goes to Stephen Strange for help, but the spell has dire consequences.Picking up just where the last one left off, Marvel cinematic universe fans rejoice, even longtime comics Spidey fans may enjoy. Both fans original Spider-Man trilogy and of the two Amazing Spider-Man films get closure. Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire reprise their roles, albeit they matured which is reflected wonderfully in where they are as their spidermen. They give Tom Holland's Peter advice, at times humorous, but offers there characters redemption and resolve.Director Jon Watts delivers a well directed spectacular outing, despite some continuity (mostly editing issues). Watts, writers Chris McKenna and\nErik Sommer achieve the seemingly impossible, by creating a coherent story while shoehorning in all three Spider-Man's and more villains than you can shake a stick at. Credit to the casting director for getting Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church back on screen respectively. If de-aging effects are used, they're pretty seamless. What is impressive is that all the actors are on fine form and get enough screen time and story beats so nobody feels short changed. Lead Holland, Zendaya's memorable M. J. and supporting cast including J. K. Simmons, Benedict Cumberbatch , Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau and Benedict Wong to name a few slot in nicely.There are plenty of multiverse spells, well-staged action sets ups and shenanigans, but the reason it arguably surpasses many of the bloated, overlong Marvel outings, is its emotional core. Holland and company never lose sight of what makes Peter so likeable and vulnerable. This carries over from the Spider-Men counterparts and offers plenty of emotional clouts, not just in terms of doing the right thing but in the high stakes storyline and the sucker-punch of Aunt May's fate mirroring Uncle Ben's demise.While we don't get the inclusion of Nicholas Hammond's Peter Parker/Spider-Man; there is a nod to his Spider-Man in the closing, with the classic comic suit design. Tom Hardy welcomingly appears as Eddie Brock / Venom in a talk of the town, head-scratching mid-credits scene at a bar. The after credit scene sets up Dr Strange 2 and connects to the 'What if...' series and has little to do with the Spider-Man character.Overall, despite some fridge logic, it's fun, but it's the memorable multiversal mayhem that plays on nostalgia and comic callbacks, that defines this Spider-Man outing as opposed to a Spidey film. It makes you feel anything is possible, maybe we'll even get an 80's Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends live-action one day.", "okay": "Is it good? Yes. But believe me, it could've been a lot better with this cast, storyline and money. The problem here is directing.It's such a shame that even that final fight scene is so unremarkable. We don't have any iconic angle, view unlike in TASM or original trilogy. Soundtrack is so lame and lazy-made unlike FFH. Tom Holland's acting is so controversial, not his best that's for sure.And the other thing I don't like about this movie is everything is happening as if they're soo planned to happen. Like it doesn't feel alive at all, at least to me. I know that's a bit confusing comment but yeah that's how I am feeling.Still 7 stars tho. Because of the cast of course. Lucky them, they have this cast and they know they will have good ratings and appreciation no matter what their work's value is.", "A Must See For Any Spiderman Fan": "Spiderman No Way Home is the latest MCU and Spiderman film. I was hyped, yet skeptical for this film before it came out. However, I have to say this is easily the best Spiderman or Spiderman related movie to come out since Into the Spiderverse. This makes sense as this film is pretty much the live action version of Into the Spiderverse. Also, there will be SPOILERS this film, as this movie is near impossible to review properly without doing so. So, tread lightly if you haven't seen the film.I'm a Spiderman fan. I've seen all the Spiderman movies all in theaters. The first two Sam Raimi films are great and a big part of my childhood. Into the Spiderverse was also really good. While Spiderman 3 has grown on me some over the years, I'm still not a big fan of it. I'm not a fan of the Amazing Spiderman films at all. I haven't seen either of the Venom movies, but I've heard they're pretty bad. So, I have not compulsion to see them any time soon. As far as Tom Holland's run goes, it's been a mixed bag. It's weird, because I like Tom Holland in the roll in Civil War and Infinity War, but as far as his solo films are concerned, I always found them lacking. The best thing about both of them have been the villains; the Vulture and Mysterio. Michael Keaton and Jack Gyllenhaal knocked it out of the park in those, but other than that I ways found those movies mediocre, boring, cringey, and they just did not feel like Spiderman to me, until this film.Not that this film does not have problems. I found the first 20-30 minutes slow. It took a little while for the film to get going. The comedy, like in the past two movies, I find to be more cringey than funny. I'm not a fan of Zendaya as MJ and especially Peter's other best friend the token comic relief. I find them annoying, not engaging, and not funny. Though, I'll say they're better utilized here than in the other movies. Dr. Strange, on the other hand, I find very funny. I prefer his more dry and subdued humor to the more over-the-top comic relief. Dr. Strange is great in this, and his chemistry with Peter is on point. I'm definitely excited for Dr. Strange 2 next year.Other than that, this movie is great, especially at the end. This film might have the best third act of any Spiderman movie, and that's no small feat. The best thing about No Way Home is that it felt like a Spiderman movie. One of my biggest complaints of Homecoming and Far from Home is that Peter felt more like Iron Man Jr. Than Spiderman. Here he is Spiderman. It's not just because we have villains and Spidermen from other universes show-up, but because of the movie's prevalent theme of power and responsibility. Another major issue with the other films is how selfish Peter comes off as and that he makes lots of major mistakes that he never really paid for. Here you see him pay for his mistakes, and he gets physically and emotionally beaten down at every turn in the film. This is classic Spiderman. In the end he learns he cannot have everything. The price of being a hero and protecting his friends means putting his personal wants on the backburner. Tom Holland gives the best performance he has ever given as Spiderman.Yes, this movie features Tobey McGuire and Andrew Garfield as Spiderman, and it's great to see them here interacting with Tom Holland. You also get many major villains from past Spiderman movies, with all the original actors back. That's insane. They all could have settled with having a cameo and phoning-in their performance, but they all bring their A-game. The Lizard and Electro are both MUCH more entertaining to watch here than in The Amazing Spiderman films.Another great thing about this film is that it's very nostalgia-heavy, but it never feels lazy or pandering. For the last couple decades there have been so many attempts to reboot old franchises to blatantly cash-in on people's nostalgia. The new Ghostbusters movies or the new Star Wars Trilogy are ideal examples of this. Those rely on nostalgia with little to nothing new of substance to offer. However, this movie did it right.Yes, it does bring back Spidermen from older franchises and old villains, but it isn't just for fan service, nor is it retreading old ground. It's telling its own unique story and those characters are part of that story and service Tom Holland's journey.Another thing I love is that this film weirdly is not just a sequel to Far from Home, but a sequel to Spiderman 3 and Amazing Spiderman 2 as well. While the movie is primarily Tom Holland's story, Tobey McGuire and Andrew Garfield get some great character moments as well, especially Garfield. Both those franchises did not end on the best note, so this felt like the ideal sendoff they both deserved. Despite my feelings on Spiderman 3 and the Amazing Spiderman films, both Tobey and Andrew were not the problem.Overall, whether you are a casual Spiderman fan or a diehard one, you need to see this film. It's not the best Spiderman film, at least to be. I'd say Spiderman 2 and Into the Spiderverse are a bit better. Also, I will always have a soft spot for the first Sam Raimi movie, even if a lot of it doesn't holdup anymore. But this film is a genuine love letter to past Spiderman movies and Spiderman in general. It's easily the best of the Tom Holland films and actually makes the first two movies better contextually. These three movies really were an extended unique origin story for Tom Holland's Spiderman. It's a bold move that I think paid off.", "\"The Real Tom Holland Spidy\"": "From other two parts (Homecoming and Far from Home), I admitted that I rarely remember details of both and nothing special imprint in my mind actually like Andrew Garfield version (Sry i love Tobey version more ;P).In my perspective, Tom Holland spidy in previous two did not stand in spotlight and moving under the big wing of Ironman.But not this one I can say 100% that No Way Home is Tom Holland spider man and meet standard or even higher std. Compare to former versionBrief story of spider man after tricked by Mysterio and acknowledge as public enemy. Even he had been through lots of big events but teenage with rough decisions can lead to complex scenario. How can he solve this problem or just make it worse ?? See in theatre by urself. \ud83d\ude09Positive thing i saw that we all will see spider man growing, facing, struggling, confusing, show more dimensions of human side like how we love since comic.For acting no doubt that Tom Holland can stand tall as himself not under any shadow from Tobey or Andrew. We can see all emotions spidy been through along the film.Production, sound of course MCU std. We love it and not surprise.Somehow in first half i think it quite slow and too much weird jokes in bad timing so i cut some points out.But eventually i love Marvel and this film gave us full of service !!! You will surprise and clap ur hands for sure xD.This is my first film watched in theatre in after tight COVID-19 situation and not disappointed at all.Cheer you all to see !!", "Joins my short-list of top comic book films.": "I am not a comic book nerd, but I did like this film quite a bit because it dealt with multiple moral themes that often go missing in other Marvel movies. So, at its core, this film is much more than CGI and multidimensional sci-fi. It deals with loss, redemption, forgiveness, introspection, malevolence, and second chances. The screenplay is low on comic book babble and high on human traits that can be used as food for thought in real life. All of the characters are well developed with individual personalities.It was also great to see the last three actors that played the iconic spiderman on one stage. We get scenes with Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield, and Toby Maguire. This film brings together fans of the Spiderman movies from the last twenty-two years. So no matter which actor you liked the best that played the web-slinger, this film will entertain you since it brings back all three together. The film also brings back some favorite actors that played the villains into one picture. Particularly the great William Dafoe as the Green Goblin. Seriously, this film has a fairly large cast of A-listers that provide a hugely entertaining picture.The film also has plenty of heart, warm and comedic scenes. The film provides some belly laughs and some tear-jerking scenes. It does all this without the nauseating misandry politics that plague recent Disney films.This film was well worth the watch.P. S. As of March 13, 2022.Here are the IMDB stats on this film.504,690 IMDb users have given a weighted average vote of 8.7 / 10\nArithmetic mean = 8.7 Median = 9I can, with great confidence say that the trolls giving this film 1s and 2s can be ignored with great reassurance. The film has already been a blockbuster success at the box office and is making a killing in after box office streams. Hence, it stands to reason that the average viewer is quite fond of the film and will be entertained. The trolls are trying to fight a battle when they already lost the war. To use adult logic in a children's comic book film in some of the reviews is stuff to chuckle at.", "CGI overload.": "I cannot share some of my fellow reviewer's enthusiasm for this film. It's probably a generation thing since I am no longer a teenager obsessed with my smartfone and play video games until I'm bug-eyed.It does score highly in the CGI department,not surprisingly. It has the look,feel and sound of a computer game.However,there is little else to engage even the tiniest part of the brain;(probably why it's so appealing to today's teens).There is no real story to speak of. The acting is adequate. Tom Holland is suitably cute in the titular role,but the actors are really subordinate to the effects.If constantly loud computer generated fights and explosions are your thing then this film scores highly.Otherwise,unless you're a braindead teen,I'd give it a miss.", "That's How You Do a Superhero Movie": "This movie contains every aspect I was looking for.The timing of everything was perfect. The humor was good. Emotions were boiling. Action is breathtaking.It was worth every second. Not a single second bored me. The interaction of Peters were really funny and fitted to the characters.We saw the real power of Spider Man. He literally beated Dr. Strange IN HIS OWN DIMENSION. He was a real hero in this movie. Showing his dark side. The sacrifices... Those scenes tore me to tears. I can't write any more.One of the finest works Marvel has ever done.", "Wow wow wow": "This movie was the best yet in the spiderman movieline, the ONLY gremlin is a superhero breaking a promise? Superheroes are role models, breaking a huge promise isn't a a good example to set for the younger or impressionable audience as its a form of lying.. HOWEVER\nThe rest of the film was fantastic, 10 out-of 10 , a great story, enjoyed it immensely, and will be rewatching it many times in the future. Not all films are rewatchable even in this franchise, but this one is., highly recommended.", "Came for the memories, and was satisfied": "I've got to be honest, the story is not that engaging to deserve a 10 but I came for the memoriesI clapped so happily when Tobey and Andrew appeared and swung together with Tom. All of the memories when I was a child watching Spider-man suddenly came back. I couldn't find the word to describe the feeling. It was a magical experience.", "A new beginning for a legendary superhero!": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is surely the most impressive movie of 2021 and its intensive promotion during the last few months really paid off. It closes a lot of storylines in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but on the other hand, it manages to create so many new possibilities for the upcoming years and Marvel's phase 4.In \"No Way Home\", Peter Parker is no longer Tony Stark's apprentice. You see Tom Holland really bringing new dimensions to the character who emerges as the responsible and independent hero he is supposed to be. This is the first MCU movie in which Parker suffers and fears, he was totally desperate. Yes, he was tested in both \"Homecoming\" and \"Far from Home\" but the general tone in these previous movies was rather comedic and entertaining. Here there is nothing about a school trip to Europe, a science competition or a Homecoming party. \"No Way Home\" is dramatic, thrilling and nostalgic. It is simply one of the darkest MCU movies together with \"Infinity War\".In this regard, I would point out the huge influence of \"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" as one of the greatest animation series ever to be made. The multiverse, the collaboration with both Daredevil and Dr. Strange, the brutal fight against the Green Goblin and the relationship with MJ were all amazingly portrayed in the spirit of the Animated Series but the highlight of the movie was Peter's relationship with his aunt May. \"No Way Home\" follows the main tradition that Peter remembers who he truly is through his parental figure. Marisa Tomei's performance is absolutely amazing and (perhaps) her final scene in the MCU is (from my point of view) the most emotional in these 27 movies.To conclude, this movie brings everything that a Spider-Man fan would love to see. Emotional scenes, dramatic fights, different villains, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield back in the game and a huge promise for the future. Will we see Peter living a new life as a poor photographer working for Jameson? Are we going to witness a Spider-Man vs. Venom storyline in the next movie? Is Kingpin entering the picture and Spider-Man's life? Is Peter going to successfully approach MJ and Ned after Doctor Strange's spell or he is going to meet a new love interest (Felicia Hardy) and new best friend (Harry Osbourne)? There is still a lot to see in potentially 3 more films.", "Spiderman multiverse - incredibly it really worked!": "I concede that I was wrong. Having whinged repeatedly about boredom over endless churning out of superhero movies, I've avoided them over recent years but got taken to this one at the cinema and was very pleasantly surprised.I aim to keep the summary simple as I have no wish to spoil the many surprises in this. What we have is the young Spiderman once again in way over his head this time getting caught up with Dr Strange in the multiverse! It's all a roller-coaster from there.Tom Holland proves he's an excellent young actor and on a par with the others whose have played the role in the past. The script is witty and funny, and the action may be a bit much but you feel it all comes together. The ensemble is great and very welcome but doesn't overwhelm the central young characters who in my opinion deserve all the credit in the Marvel world.The story thankfully is not the usual retread of the Marvel world, so we have a relatively different story that goes it's own way. I have to admit that I haven't watched the last Spiderman movie, but that didn't spoil my enjoyment here.If you want a fun action packed film, which doesn't rely on all the muscle, then this is it! It's very worthwhile watching. Just hope other superhero movies can learn lessons from this film.", "I am tired of Marvel Formula": "Pros:-\nfan servicetom holland's actingold villainsdoctor strangeentry of our favourite spidermansemotional scenes between 3 spidermansCons:-\ntobey Maguire's average performance (it's like he was there just to get paid)convenient surprises from supporting characters like Nedmarvels formula for every 2 mins joke even after an emotional scenevillains changing their decision every two minutes and after they lost their power suddenly they are friends with spiderman again.this movie only got made because spiderverse was huge success.", "Waste of Time & Money": "This movie in my opinion was aimed for teeny boppers.

The earlier Spider Man movies were fairly decent and had a spark to them but i just can't say any nice things about this one.

Two thumbs down, way way down.", "A tribute to Spider-Man.": "This movie is perfect, it has everything you've ever wanted from a Spider-Man movie and more.Brilliant score, great performances, action, comedy, drama, romance and some of the brightest moments in any Spider-Man film before.I thought it would struggle to give every character their moments but they all shined and some characters got even better like Green Gobling, Doc Ock and Electro; and of course Tobey and Andrew, just as amazing as they've always been.You will laugh, scream, cry and cheer.", "Best spider Man ever": "All I can say it puts avengers endgame to shame there's a reason why they keep doing Spider-Man films and this is it 10/10 the nostalgia is unreal loved every minute of it.", "Three different Spidermen as the Multiverse gets jumbled.": "It is a novel and interesting approach, several Marvel characters get involved, including Dr Strange and his fantastic magic, and we end up with three different Spidermen. Ultimately they have to band together to prevent irreversible fracturing of the space-time continuum.It is a bit over two hours long, my wife and I watched it at home on BluRay from our public library. We enjoyed it as good entertainment but for me some of the prior Spiderman movies are superior.", "Best Spiderman movie!!": "It's a really good way to end the 2021, with the most awaited movie.

He reach out to Dr. Strange and ask him to cast a spell so everyone can forget about who Spiderman really is, after several interfrances from Peter the spell is broken which causes villians such as Green Goblin from the original Spider-man trilogy and The Lizard from The Amazing Spider-Man films and many apon many others who know that Peter is Spiderman from different universes to enter into his universe. Now it is up to Peter to send them back to there universe.This movie from beginning to end was perfect as well as nostalgic seeing both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as their version Spider-man was a real treat. As well as many of the returing actors such as Alfred Molina, William DeFoe, Thomas Haden Church, Jamie Fox and Rhys Ifans as their respevtive roles from their movies. As well as the current actorsThe music was excellent it was real nostalgia hearing the Rami theme.Pretty much a perfect Spider-man film from start to finish.", "Finally they made justice to Spiderman": "The film alternates between the mediocre and the fantastic, fortunately the great moments outweigh the poorly made.Tom Holland and Willem Dafoe put on excellent performances, probably two of the best of the year. Without a doubt, they are the strongest point of the film.This time Peter Parker does have a development and has to face the consequences of his actions.Overall, a pretty good movie, with some flaws and poor decisions, such as excessive use of CGI, poorly grounded jokes, and over-explanatory dialogue, among others. But a great movie. Definitely the best of the trilogy.", "Spider-Man No Way Home A Amazing Spider-Man Movie": "No Way Home was even better than I imagined and definitely lived up to all the hype and my high expectations seeing Tobby Andrew and Tom's Spider-Men all together and also Matt Murdock at the start, Was amazing as someone who loved all the Spider-Man movies also I loved when Electro hinted at Miles Morales, I felt the ending where Peter was at the donut shop with MJ and Ned was very bittersweet but I loved it, Also damn... that last post credit scene for Multiverse Of Madness was Amazing can't wait to see Dr. Strange in his own movie again and can't wait to see Scarlet Witch back also was that a evil Dr. Strange..., Anyway overall I thought the entire movie was Amazing and blew all my expectations away 10/10 :)", "Engaging movie , flawless storyline , fascinating action sequence": "No words just go and see...

A much more enjoyable theater experience than even Endgame. This is a movie for the true Spiderman fans out there and I was also shocked to see a cameo of Matt Murdock/Daredevil in the film (possible solo marvel movie coming for him...idk but fingers crossed). All of the spidey villains did an amazing job specifically Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina who brought their \"A\" game after all these years. Andrew and Tobey's performances were so good as well and props to the director and writers for making their entrance so seamless and giving them so much screen-time! I specifically enjoyed Andrew Garfield and felt like he got the redemption that he so deserves after the hate he received from his spiderman movies. Hopefully this film sets ip a possible TASM 3 for Andrew and another Spider-Man 4 for Tobey. The ending of the film was fantastic and reveals how these last 3 movies hace been an origin story for Tom's Spider-Man and how he now has to rely on his own wit rather than the Avengers. Tom's acting was phenomenal and he depicted a more brutal and grungy Spider-Man who has lost everything.

And this movie really managed to surprise, I can bet that there has never been anything like this in Marvel, and indeed in the history of cinema. This is a kind of culmination of everything we knew about Spider-Man, I think this picture managed to surpass even the original source, namely comics, in which there are more plot twists and crossovers than anywhere else, we can say we have been going to this for 19 years and finally got what we could not even dream of. This movie is a solid fan service, just a gift for fans, anticipating all expectations, in other words, it turned out better than we thought, this really happens rarely.", "WOW - saying that being not a spider-man fan!": "That's a real entertainment, feels like a solid rollercoaster! I am not a big fan of spider-man franchise and to be honest I believe spider thing is weakest in MCU but this movie brings it to the next level, refreshing masterpiece. 100% one of the strongest films recently released this year. Highly recommended!", "Best Marvel Movie ever": "The movie was 10/10 in my opinion and will always be the best marvel movie ever. The day that I watched it in theaters was a fantastic experience. I enjoyed the movie a lot and Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield coming back as Spider-Man made it better. Willem Dafoe did another great job as Green Goblin. He proved that he is the best spider man villain ever. Electro, Doc ock, Sandman, and Lizard coming back also made it more exciting since all 3 Spider-Men would be fighting all the villains. The movie was really enjoyable and the crowd noises were really high whenever Andrew and Tobey came back.", "Mindblowing, absolutely unique cinematic experience which gives you endless joy!": "Oh boy what do I even write in here... This file was an absolutely unique experience of my life. Never had I been smiling, panting, noding, almost crying in cinema in my life. This movie is something else in terms of emotions it brings in you, if you are familiar, of even more, a fan of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films of Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man films. The way it brings back its villains, and then, hell, Tony and Andrew back is an endless joy! This is THE best Marvel crossover, and THE best crossover at all, hands down.I had a funny feeling of wanting to laugh and cry at the same time when Goblin and Dock Ock first appeared, during their interactions with each other and with Spider-Men, and Jesus Christ, had I this kid of feelings during the Spider-Men interactions with each other!Go see this movie. It is not-so-great film in itself in terms of directing, plot, etc., but in terms of emotions, feelings it brings in you, it is an absolute masterpiece and a must-watch for every Spidey fan there is!Thank you, thank you, thank you Marvel, producers, Kevin, Tom, Alfred, Willem, Jamie, Tobey, Andrew, and everyone everyone else involved in making this.I am so very happy that I live in the universe where this film exists!Cheers.", "utter rubbish": "This is a teenager movie with all their nonsensical self-absorbed stupidity on display. No need to say any more but 150 is the minimum so I am still typing.", "A MASTERPIECE EVERYONE WAITED FOR!!!": "This movie is absolutely amazing, theres no doubt about it/ dont believe the people who say this movie sucks. (spoilers) this movie even redeemed andrew garfield saving mj and having andrew, tobey and tom together is just pure perfection. Their synergy was so good theres no doubt that this truly is, the best marvel movie. Nay 1 of the best movies in THE WORLD.", "Just wow": "It's always concerning when there is so much hype around a movie and then on top of that, being a Marvel movie fan myself, I have certain expectations.Not my fault, Marvel set the bar, so they have to keep at that level or exceed it and they did that here!The story is fantastic, everything you wanted and more. I did not think they could beat Homecoming but I have to say that I think they did with this movie. Tom Holland is again a great representation of the character. They pack so much story into this movie and yet it totally works. When Spider-Man 3 came out with Toby, it was too much, too many characters, too much story etc. But with this movie, it works.When I look back on it, I can't say that there was anything I did not like, I thought that they nailed every aspect of the movie. The bad guys were great, the story line made sense and was easy to follow, the cameos were impressive and well executed and each cameo really brings their version of their character to life.Overall I was super impressed and 10 stars is just an instinct, i just can't see anything that I didn't like I this movie, I left the theatre and I was genuinely happy that I saw it and it was everything that I was hoping it would be. When you think of the Marvel franchise, it could be easy to worry that it will never be the same now that some characters are retired/gone from the franchise. This movie gives me hope that the great storylines are there and new characters are always ready to enter the fold. If your a Spider-Man fan, I'm sure you will love this movie, it has everything a Spider-fan could want and more!", "Probably one of the best..": "No long paragraph necessary, but this movie was AMAZING! The massive amounts of nostalgia and surprises has easily put this movie into one of my favorite marvel movies of all time. Loved every second of it.", "Great combination of heart, humor, action and nostalgia": "The newest Spiderman film, NO WAY HOME, is pretty much review proof in that there is such a strong, built-in audience for it, that it would do well even if it is a bad movie.Fortunately for everyone, it is a really, really GOOD film.Dipping deeply into nostalgia, but being it's own movie as well, NWH strikes the balance between nostalgia and sentimentality quite well. This is because the nostalgic portion of this film is a compliment to the story itself - and not the main focus.Credit for this must go to returning Director Jon Watts (he Directed the previous Spidey outing, FAR FROM HOME) and screenwriters Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers (and the powers to be at Marvel Studios). They balance the action -and a plotline that could be confusing - with ease. They made a basic, but important, decision. They kept things as simple as possible and leaned on the characters - and performances - to be the core of this film (and not the plot intracancies, the nostalgia and the Special Effects).This is easy to do when you have 3 main characters in Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon as Peter Parker, MJ and Ned that are very charming and endearing performers at the heart of it - characters that the audience wants to spend time with. Add to that the domineering and forceful performance of Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange, the comic relief of Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan and the warm and loving performance of Marisa Tomei as Aunt May and this film has a solid foundation to build on.And, of course, there are the appearances of other characters/performers that the audience will well know from other properties - to mention them would be to spoil this film - but, suffice it to say, each one tops the one before it, building to a fun crescendo of heart, humor, action and nostalgia.A very winning combination - and well worth checking out. And...if you're comfortable with doing this - see it with an audience, it adds to the experience.Letter Grade: A9 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)", "Borrows Ideas, but Still an Interesting Continuation for this Franchise": "This was a movie that I was late to. I was intrigued to see it since I'm a fan of this comic book character. Seeing that they were going to merge him with Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) made it intriguing. I'll admit, this was spoiled for me so I knew what the gimmick here was. I actually made my wife, Jaime, watch all the Spider-Man movies from Tobey Maguire to Andrew Garfield as well so she would understand a bit more.Ahead of seeing, I tried to temper my expectations. I'll be honest, that was difficult to do. I had trouble getting into this one. I don't mind the beginning story of having Peter Parker's (Tom Holland) life turned upside down thanks to J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons) revealing that he's Spider-Man to the world. He comes up with a plan and needs the help of Dr. Strange. This make even more problems for him.Now I know it seems that I'm coming in negative. This movie is playing to the nostalgia in me and fans. Despite me struggling to get into this, I did come around. I like the characters that they bring in. I feel that is a good send off for the ones that got a bad wrap for their movies. I'm just not sure this is as strong as the other movies in the Holland line for me. I do like his taking on of Spider-Man/Peter Parker as well as Zendaya as MJ and Jacob Batalon as Ned Leeds. This goes a bit sad in the end that I wasn't expecting.I should also say that this is a CGI-fest. That is come to be expected. It still looks good. The cinematography is fine. I thought that the older characters that are brought in are good. The only one I'd go as far to say being great is Willem Dafoe. This movie knows what it is doing and I can appreciate that for sure.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.", "Yep. It is awesome": "Again, Marvel tampered with the trailers. And again, it was for the better. Watch this movie. You won't regret it. I left the cinema wanting to watch the movie again immediatly.", "Even though I love this Movie": "Love this Movie especially having the other Spidies in there made this a great Movie...I'm a true fan of the comics and spidey has been one of the most loved characters of the Comic franchise that I've followed since my young days...over 30yrs...And I've enjoyed all the Spidey movies..keep producing them...BC ill keep watching...no matter who is cast.Would of been nice if Tobey M going back to MJ being married and with a kid.Garfield going back and finding a MJ and dating.... Maybe in the next Spidey Movie into the Universe? Bringing them all back together again.", "Stunning": "An amazing collection of old and new with a great balance of big and small connections to the series. It's entertaining throughout and funny. A truly well done and well thought out film.", "Best MCU and Spider-Man movie": "Went to watch this movie with high expectations and I wasn't disappointed. Most of the flaws of MCU Spider-Man were solved in this installment. John Watts outdid himself with the awesome direction, film has a lot of exciting and emotional scenes. It's a must watch if you're even slightly interested in superheroes.", "2021 best marvel movie": "Watch it in Sweden 15 dec and you won't be disappointed. Dr strange and Spider-Man works really well. It's has the charm of the others movies in this trilogy and if you like the other two before this one a most see. Great, actors, cinematography and effects. This one and Shang-chi stood out this year in different ways!", "Just for fans.....": "So, you really have to be a super fan to get anything from this film...It's good, but super fans have rated this film so high, real film fans ratings have been inflated! For me 7 from 10..... and here's why.It's cringworthy in points, take the spiderman bromance for example.Pointless in others. Take the ending, everyone is going to forget who spiderman is? Early in the film, spiderman was nowhere near the people spiderman was trying to get Dr Strange to add to the remember list - hense the idea of the film. But at the end, spiderman was standing next to the people he cared most about (that was left). Surely all he had to do was stand in front of them in his half spiderman suit....? Think they would have known who he was straight away...\nAnd that news caster, \"I hate everything about spiderman\" character... was just a waste of space.. I know this character is a big thing to spiderman fans... sorry. But it was soooo annoying, to the point of distraction. Utterly pointless.This film missed a lot of Marvel humour. The action was there... the plotline, partially. Adding a lot of wasted, space filling sequences.But then after all this, I suppose, who am I to cast a view, I'm not a fan.", "It's ok........but it isn't amazing!!!!!!!": "Let's get this off straight away.........it's awesome to see everything in this movie..............but its lots to take in, it is a bundle of too much too quick - the writing is not very well thought through - many things don't make sense - and the nostalgia bait is too much!For example when Peter starts the spell going wrong and is being told to be quiet by Dr strange - that is basically how logical and well written the movie is...........dumb dumb dumb - and basically that is what to expect for the rest of the movie!Another example of bad writing - everyone travels into this 616 demension because they know who Peter Parker is.........however electro had no idea who he was - he even says the line at the end \"I thought you would be black\"\nSo that ruins that rule to the movies plot..........Basic marvel nostalgia bait - they don't understand the characters - but yet people lap it up........I don't understand!6 out of 10.", "The Villains, the Hero's & the happy Spidey Fan.": "After watching the trailers and seeing some of my favourite comic book villains are returning to the big screen, the excitement for this film has been unreal - especially Alf Molina as Doc Ock...\n...and J. Watts certainly did not disappoint after bringing the multiverse to life in this 'coming of age' heartfelt superhero movie that pretty much anyone will enjoy and understand.I'm not going to be that guy who spoils anything - just get your bum in that cinema chair.", "Best film": "It is best film. You should watch it. I really love it. The concept, emotions, and offcourse the touch of true love and family. I am totally amazed by this film. Action, situations, thrills, this film got everything to enjoy with you family.", "Super enjoyable!": "Please go to cinema ! You must enjoy it! Buy a popcorn , soda and a hotdog!!! And never blink because it catch you was a 2 hours a little bit most exciting ever! I returned to my childhood again!", "What did I miss?": "I know that everyone else seems to have enjoyed this film, but I don't understand why. I found myself without a care for any of the main characters. The villains were dredged up from previous movies, the heroes were two dimensional (with the usual exception of Dr Strange, brought to life by Benedict Cumberbatch) and the action sequences, although spectacular, were no more so than any previous blockbuster.I can only guess that if you like Spider-Man, he can do no wrong but this movie really failed to do anything for me.It's a pity because I was really looking forward to it.", "Spider-Man at its finest!": "I was blown away by the movie. Never have I seen something so perfect!Great performance. Some really iconic fights and characters. It will be really hard to top this movie with future franchises.", "Back to formula?": "'Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)' is the conclusion to Jon Watts' Spider-Man trilogy, a highly anticipated blockbuster that promises to be the biggest solo superhero movie of all time. Sailing past $1 billion dollars at the box-office (the first film post pandemic to do so), the picture not only broke the bank, it also broke the internet. Indeed, anyone who hasn't been living under a rock for the past year probably already knows more about the highly secretive plot than they'd like to; even those who've stayed off the internet altogether are likely to have their efforts squandered at the last second, especially if they decide to rent/ purchase the movie from the Apple store (beware major spoilers on the film's own page). Don't worry, though, I don't intend to spoil anything here... at least, not yet. As such, I'm going to keep things as vague as possible.Coming in at 148 minutes, the film is one of the longest entries in the MCU. Despite everything it aims to cram into its admittedly somewhat bloated runtime, it somehow manages to be shorter than 'Eternals (2021)'. Thankfully, it's also a lot more propulsive and, crucially, fun. It moves at a real clip, dropping you straight into its action after briefly catching you up on the cliffhanger ending of 'Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019)'. Much of the first act plays out in pseudo-montage, skimming over large chunks of time but still managing to hammer home the consequences of the previous movie's shocking climax. It's immediately darker in tone than either of its fairly light predecessors, something which only grows more apparent as the piece moves into its own finale, but it still has a high-school heart and maintains the series' signature sense of humour. It balances its tone well throughout, effortlessly bouncing between moments that tickle your ribs and moments that tug at your heartstrings without ever feeling as though it undermines itself. That's a difficult thing to do.The feature remains remarkably focused on character considering its sheer amount of spectacle; it makes sure that all of its elements, no matter how extraneous they may be, feel as though they shape Spider-Man and his allies. It's easy to look at the film, which is undeniably part of a money-making franchise and very likely originated as a studio mandate rather than a filmmaker's inspired idea, and see nothing other than corporate cynicism. However, it genuinely feels as though it has been made by people who care. They clearly have reverence for the source material, crafting characters that feel very true to who they're supposed to be, and they also have reverence for the fans - in fact, they seem to be fans themselves. Even if they started from a studio-dictated endpoint designed to get bums in seats, they managed to work backwards and make something that doesn't feel lazy or like a cash grab. Instead, it feels like a celebration of its characters, as well as an ambitious attempt to do something that isn't quite like anything else out there. It's also just incredibly fun. At the end of the day, that's what really matters.A lot of the feature is comprised of blatant fan service and it occasionally (though only occasionally) crosses the line into corporate cringe, but I'd be lying if I said that even some of the most banal references didn't make me smile. It's not as if its nostalgia bait is separate from its story, either; in fact, it's intrinsically tied to it. This means that even its fan service is consequential to its narrative, used to actually the build core pillars of its story rather than simply decorate them. Most of its surprises are handled really well, with a majority of them resulting in tangible repercussions and rising above their potentially one-shot nature. Nothing here truly feels like a gimmick. That's all I can really say about this aspect without spoiling things too much.Some of the plot doesn't quite make sense, and you're likely to be scratching your head about certain high-concept ideas even after the credits have rolled. It's not as if there's anything all that thematically or conceptually complex going on, it's just that the affair sort of hand-waves its way through some fairly major aspects of its story. It also explains a few of those aspects in ways that eventually contrast with how they actually play out (again, I'm being as vague as possible to avoid spoilers). Though a number of character decisions are ever-so-slightly questionable, they are always the result of fallible individuals whose choices actively shape their personality; as such, they aren't at all bothersome. What is bothersome, though, is that some of the flick's own internal logic simply doesn't line up. It isn't totally detrimental, but it definitely makes the thing feel a bit more rough around the edges than it ought to. This is also frustratingly close to not even being an issue, as one or two rewritten lines would solve almost all of the noticeable flaws (at least when it comes to what you may call 'plot holes'). Still, it's impressive that the picture manages to do everything that it does (which is quite a lot) without feeling overly dense or plodding. I'd much rather have an inconsistent blast than an air-tight bore. Plus, the picture almost asks you not to think about the ins and outs of its plot too much; I think that's a fair thing to ask when it provides this much entertainment.It's not as if it's brainless, either. It has a fairly strong, relatively distinct thematic underpinning and its central conflict is interesting in that it's born not from an insidious intervention, but from a character's bold decision to try to do the right thing (once more, that's all I'll say to avoid spoiling things). The movie also has a handful of affecting moments, emerging as a much more emotionally mature and resonant affair than most of its peers. This is compounded by, for my money, some of the best performances in the MCU. Holland is surprisingly good here, capable of selling the emotion as well as the banter, and some of the other core players (who shall remain nameless) definitely earn their paychecks, too. However, a couple of its characters are underserved (one, in particular, is practically robbed) and the story does occasionally struggle to balance its elements in a way that makes them all seem as though they have equal - or, I suppose, proportional - weight.The film looks really good considering that most of it was filmed in that magical land known as the blue screen studio (and some of it seems to have been shot in a shoe cupboard), with its CGI environments often being indistinguishable from its real sets. Of course, its digital elements also sometimes fall a bit flat. This doesn't bother me massively, primarily because even the least practical sequences are still gripping, but I can't deny I would have preferred to see a few more real-life locations. The action set-pieces are all fantastic and, often, surprisingly brutal. The picture maintains a good balance between web-slinging fantasy and hand-to-hand fisticuffs, all while keeping its action grounded and believable. These are some of the best sequences of their kind in the entire MCU. They're consequential, tense, exciting and immensely entertaining.Ultimately, that's the best way to describe the overall film: immensely entertaining. It's just an absolute riot. It has its issues, of course, but none of them really take away from how fun it is. Just because it probably started as a lazy studio mandate meant to milk money from a content-hungry fanbase doesn't mean it can't rise above its half-hearted origins (thanks to the creative team involved) to become an ambitious and effective crowd-pleaser. Films have pretty much always been made primarily to make money, but that doesn't mean they don't have any non-monetary value. Like many of its contemporaries, this may not be arthouse, but that doesn't mean it isn't art. It's perhaps one of the best pictures of its kind.--SPOILERS--I was going to break down a few elements of the film in more detail here, but (at least for now) I'm all talked out. Besides, I feel as though I managed to talk about the picture fairly comprehensively without spoiling anything major (hopefully it isn't too vague). Instead, I have decided just to highlight what's possibly my favourite moment in the entire movie:Spider-Man pins Green Goblin to a wall with his knees and begins hitting him in the face with elbow after elbow. With each strike, the Goblin's gleeful eyes light up more and an insidious smile stretches further across his face. Then, he erupts into his iconic cackle and turns the tables on his attacker.That right there is the stuff dreams are made of.", "No Way you can believe it is sooooo good!": "Somehow I felt the Tom Holland version of Spiderman was more of an extension of Ironman legacy with of course new characters and big splash of humour. But No Way Home proved me wrong in every possible way.Spiderman is different from all other MCU characters. He is confused, conflicted, vulnerable and innocent to the core. This movie does true justice to reinforce that. The struggles of a teen superhero, all the emotions, ambitions and I-want-to-do-good-because-I-want-to-not-because-I-can could not have been expressed better.Cinematography is very good. 3D experience, background music, illusions and graphics are as good as \"Into the Spiderverse\".Any further comments would spoil the fun, which I don't want to do. Please go ahead and live this experience and be transported back to your past where hope, love and friendship meant everything. :)", "Long, drawn out": "Again I don't get why Hollywood thinks we need to endlessly draw out these films, I've been really disappointed lately with films like this, the batman, where they just draw out and have very loose and unclear plots and dialogue.Just not well executed as a film.", "A great fan service for a hardcore spiderman fans and for the new one": "There's a many reason why spiderman is one of the most famous superhero character that maybe just batman franchise can rival the character popularity, spidey have a great comic book story, cool cartooon, great video game, controversy broadway adaptation, great gallery of villain and one of the earliest superhero movie that success in the past. Even if spiderman never make a live action film spiderman will always be popular, and with all the privileges that spiderman have than other superheroes he still use the other privileges by combining spiderman movie that was great success in the past with the new saga that Marvel cinematic universe bring, he combine nicely all of them that bring all the fans satisfied with the result and justification his position as one of the greatest superhero character.", "They did it perfectly": "There is nothing else to say, they were able to bring all the characters and fitted perfectly, it was just so much fun seeing the characters slowly getting to kmow each other and become friends. Definitely the best marvel movie ever!", "I understand the hype": "I'm not gonna bang on too much on this film. I don't really feel the need to.Was the film entertaining? Absolutely yes. (Can end then review here if you want!)Did the \"multiverse\" and all the characters work? This was the part I was a little curious on. Because even though it sounds fun on paper, will it really work? Well, it really did. The characters all had fun arcs to get stuck into and the comedy aspect/chemistry really worked well, much better than I though in fact. But for me what I really loved was just the old characters back again (not spoiling anything there), this is the one superhero film I've always enjoyed and watched since the beginning so to see it all now with better CGI etc was such a nice feeling.It is overhyped? There's no doubt this had to be absolutely huge in order to match the hype it's got, but they pulled it off. I've been critical of other marvel films for not matching the hype, but this film is near perfection. Great characters, great plot and thoroughly fun. What more do you want?I'll just end it with \"do I need to have seen the other Spider-Man's to enjoy this?\" I don't think you do no. However I think it would help, but it's certainly not essential and you won't be lost if you haven't.I recommend at the end of the day. A lot of fun. 9/10.", "Not a great film, but incredibly fun.": "I honestly did not know what to expect with this movie. After watching it, though, I can say that it's the most fun I've ever had in the cinemas. And while No Way Home has several inconsistencies throughout its writing and plot, the moments that do work have an incredible impact on the viewing experience. I loved the darker themes explored throughout this film (i.e. Aunt May's Death and the publicized aftermath), as they were reminiscent of The Dark Knight (i.e. Rachel's Death). The sequences between Spider-Man and Green Goblin also reminded me of (the) Batman and Joker as well, and they were pretty sick.When it came to Andrew's and Tobey's appearances, there were times when I was left unsatisfied- but they were immediately rectified with amazing emotional captures between the three Spider-Men. Their chemistry was great to see on screen. I loved the mentor relationship Tobey's Peter had to Tom's, and the way Andrew's Peter was a brother to them as well.I guess what doesn't make sense to me the most was the whole multiverse concept (and relating to/thereof); it wasn't very clear to me throughout the film. It felt as though the writers didn't have enough time to flush out all of the ideas within the given run time. The disappearance of all the villains and Spider-Men at the end happened without much explanation. It just felt rushed.Overall...despite having some issues, I feel as though Spider-Man: No Way Home was able to redeem itself through the heart and fun of it all. It's a love letter to Spider-Man fans, and a film I will always have a special place for in my heart.", "Honestly one of the best": "I have watched all of Marvel Universe movies so far out.

The chemistry between the characters (specifically the three -REDACTED- and the villains were amazing) was amazing and the humor was definitely better than the first two MCU movies. Also, without spoiling, this movie does a good job addressing events from the other Spider-Man movies (make of that what you will). Also, everything is wrapped up in a perfect way, and there are no loose plot holes (from what I could see). Action was amazing, definitely on par with the other Spider-Man movies (what could this mean? \ud83e\udd14). The music was great as well, probably the better sound track of this MCU Spider-Man trilogy. I'm excited to see what happens next with this Spider-Man.", "Good, but overrated": "This movie is absolutely amazing, but sooo overrated.

Not only does it have cool effects and wonderful acting, but it also has cameos of Peter Parkers/Spider-Men from the other movies! The effects and cinematography look really colorful and realistic. It is slightly emotional; Nevertheless, there is also action, comedy and surrealism! The acting is perfect. There are also cameos of villains from the other movies in the Spider-Man franchise and other MCU (Marvel Cinamatic Universe) stories! Here are the themes that I have gathered from watching this movie:-First, there is a bit of public humiliation. Specifically, Tom Holland's version of the title character is exposed by the dying mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) after the incident they are both involved in on London Bridge. As a result of this, the former is publicly criticized, bullied, shamed, arrested and is even denied college admission. His peers, MJ (Mary Jane (Zendaya) ) and Ned *(Jacob Batalon)* as well as his authority figures, Aunt May (Marisa Tomai) and *Happy Hulgan (Jon Fareveau)* go through the same stuff.-Secondly, support is also a part of the mix. To clear his and his family's, teacher's and friends' names, she turns to Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to erase, from everyone's mind, the fact that he is Spider-Man and knows who he knows. This way, it would be as if he was never committed a crime.-Third, we could get an insight on the occasional costly outcomes of mistakes. Despite Strange's assistance, nonetheless there is a malfunction, and villains from other universes get involved and commit their wrongdoing, with one action killing Aunt May (Marisa Tomai), in another melancholy instance in this story...-...which takes me to my forth thing, empathy. Saddened by her passing, Holland's Parker/Spider-Man listens to the Parker/Spider-Men of the other universes talk about losing their loved ones in other instances (Tobey Maguire's version - Uncle Ben (Gunshot), Andrew Garfield's version - Gwen Stacy (Fall) ).-Fifth, there is power = responsibility. At the end, he swings his way around Manhattan perhaps to fight more evil (power) and save the world (responsibility)!-Sixth (and attached to my aforementioned subject example, there is resiliency!

I left the movie theatre satisfied.", "Did not disappoint": "I had very high expectations for this movie and it didn't just meet them. It surpassed them. This movie was everything I wanted and more. Tom Holland gave his best performance as Peter Parker in this movie and Willem Dafoe gave an even better performance of the Goblin than he did in 2002. This movie was fantastic. It was emotional, action pack and full of heart. I loved it. This is everything I want in a Spider-Man movie.", "A spectacle, not a movie": "I can't review this movie because it is not a movie. The writing of the characters and the cinematography are non existent. The acting is dull with the exception of William Dafoe who does his best given very little help from the script and the director and the only frames I can recall from that movie were the ones directly borrowed from Sam Raimi.18 years old Spiderman trapping Dr Strange into the mirror dimension the first time he's been there is the most cringy plot line ever.", "Best Spider-Man to date!": "This was such an amazing and emotional movie! It made me laugh and feel joy, yet also tear up and feel sad for Peter losing everything and everyone close to him. I loved the character growth of Peter. I love howand he was able to get inspiration from May and the other Spider-Men to help him overcome his rock bottom. The returning villians were so iconic and brought a lot of nostalgia. I loved the meme line by Willam Dafoe about being a scientist. So great! And the way the Toby and Andrew were brought back was so well executed! Andrew really shined and I loved his redemption saving MJ and how emotional he got. Yes there were some flaws and at times a bit fast with pacing but holy cow was this an amazing movie!", "1/10 Impulsive, immature, no chemistry on screen, no heart! Bad acting": "Incredibly well thought of that it turns into chaos, his character turns into a menace, in fact, I hated him many times with his decisions, overconfident but no real impressive display of power but more on gadgets that doesn't really help much! This Spiderman does not have the spank, the heart, what makes a movie tick is \"the feel good\". This one is well thought that they missed the-Spiderman-the loveable and wants to save the world..This one is teenager (but too muscular) , focus on having good time with friends, no real superhero saving moment, this movie did not make me feel good when I got out of the movie house.. it's not memorable and it's over publicized. Him and his love interest has no chemistry on screen... blame it on the casting screw? He can't act either, not IMPRESSED AT ALL!No more Tom Holland next time.. I want Tobey Mcguire back...", "The Spiderman movie I didn't know I needed.": "This is the Spiderman movie I didn't know I needed. Ok so I love Tom Hollands Spiderman, I think he's perfect for it and he has grown into the role since the first movie. In my opinion this is Toms best Spiderman movie yet. I'm genuinely surprised that they somehow managed to climb even higher with this installation. But also, I absolutely loved having Garfield and Maguire back. And the way that Garfield saved Hollands MJ had me in tears, Maguire and Ottos reunion. Oh my gosh. I actually cried during this movie, it was the perfect mix of action, comedy and heartfelt moments. Also loved all of the Easter eggs and nudges to Maguires and Garfields Spiderman as well as to the Playstation games and even Peter Morales. Here's to hoping for a Peter Morales installation as well!!Watch it, I don't think you'll be dissapointed.Watch it.I do really hope Holland will get to make more Spiderman movies in the future.", "Complete rollercoaster": "A superb film, easily on of tge top 5 mcu movies. A real roller coaster of emotions, exciting storylines, full of surprises and an excellent lay out for future projects. As someone who has been dissappointed with spiderman movies in the past, this well exceeded the expectations I had for it and is by far the best spiderman movie. Definitely well worth going to watch.", "Entertaining!!!": "One of the most anticipated movies in recent years, no way home is certainly an enjoyable ride, especially for those who grew up watching all spider man movies starting with Sam Raimi and ending with Tom holland's version. Plot is good, but it could have been better, like Strange being outsmarted by parker in a world that he is in control of and even if he was outsmarted, he should have been out of there soon where in movie, he is trapped there for a large amount of time, and there were some other inconsistencies too, but it does not matter. Overall a great movie and worth your time.", "Don't believe the hype": "I was hyped after seeing the trailers and its high score here and good reviews. But the movie is mediocre at best with some funny moments.The biggest fault is that the main plot is plain stupied. Doctor Stranges spell to make everybody forget about Peter goes wrong and rips a hole in the multiverse. Its just a stupied idea to base a movie on and even worse to make a sequel with the upcoming Doctor Strange movie.Also the villans are to many to get enough screen time to feel interesting even if we know them from before.With that said i laughed at some points in the movie but if you want too see the it you better turn your brain off first.", "Really the worst of all Spider-man movies": "Not to say that Spider-man movies are for grown-ups, but this was by far the most childish of them all. I caught myself looking at the news on the phone waiting for the movie to finish.Ever since Andrew Garfield stepped into the red(ish) shoes, the movies were really enjoyable. Tom Holland was even better (although Garfield is until now the far better actor). But this latest one is really a disappointment. And it cannot be only because Tobey Maguire is back in it (although it 'helps'). If anything, please don't bring Daniel Radcliffe in, to destroy the franchise once and for all.", "Special effects boredom": "This was a repeat story line from the animated spiderman which was much better. Literally no storyline, just special effects orgasms. They brought in cameos from old Spider-Man movies to fill the void. Almost no point to this movie.", "Fixing the evil ???": "Trying to fix the evil???? Dude this is no remote control. I gave this nonsense movie 3 stars because I get to see the first spider man that's it,a bit nostalgia rest is a circus.", "Random meaningless trash": "The plot is \"Spiderman gets #metoo'd and #defunded\".The first part plays like an unnecessary criticism of the modern civil rights movement. Jameson is the main villian of the movie, and he plays a pundit dead set on getting SpiderMan arrested, which to be fair is pretty standard for a SpiderMan movie. But to then use visuals, protests, and slogans that evoke the MeToo and BLM movements comes off as *extremely* distasteful.The cameos were unnecessary and completely ruined the immersion. The entire premise was just to stroke Disney's ego, because some producer wanted to show off that they managed to get the rights from Sony.After Aunt May died, they milked her death for *way* too long. The camera just hovered over the wreckage silently for almost 2 minutes, followed by literally 10-15 minutes of characters staring silently off-camera not saying anything.The plot was just random BS. They decide to do everything on a whim with zero reasoning. Whether it's casting a spell to rewrite the universe, or deciding to save the villians' lives, there is absolutely zero thought put into any of their actions. That would be OK if the point of the movie was that doing random stuff is bad. But then they tried to make the movie about the importance of forgiveness, which misses the key point that *none* of the bad things in this movie would have happened if anyone had acted with any amount of reason.", "Another super hero movie": "I must admit I was a little unsure about spending my money on another Spider-Man movie.But it had pretty good reviews so I thought I'd give it a go on the big screen. Sadly it suffered the same fate as the previous couple of incarnations. Once the interesting back story is complete, you're just left with a pretty dull super hero looking for an excuse to use the wiz bang CGI and terribly loud and annoying sound effects.Still in the top 75% of super hero films. But that's an increasingly large percentage of all films and one day that bubble must burst. Please burst.", "A rollercoaster of emotions.": "Fun, great action, and a very good story.Not going to lie, I was losing interest on the Marvel movies but spider-man is special for me. And this didn't disappoint and I want more marvel now.A lot of emotions with a very solid acting. I just enjoyed this movie so much, it's really all of a experience if you love superheros movies.I feel like sometimes is very convenient and it has little mistakes, but like I said, it's not perfect, but fun, with epic moments, and all of a experience, go watch it and enjoy the best closure for this trilogy.", "Didn't really like it": "Rescuing the villains seems weird especially when they are forcefully injected with an unknown serum. The multiverse concept was already played out in the animation and I felt it was a bit lazy of them to do it again. Overall, I prefer the previous Far From Home to this.", "SPIDER - MAN NO WAY HOME!!!!!!!!!!": "I am so thrilled by this masterpiece. Marvel Studios Spider - Man No Way Home is something you have never seen before, and truly \"Never Seen Before\". It is filled with laughter, ugly violence, amazing stunts and amazing twists. The entire cast has done a phenomenal job in delivering this awesome piece of artwork to the cinemas. This film is an experience filled with a ton of emotional sequences that would just make your heart feel so warm and at times sad. The characters have been explored in depth and the whole film gives you a nostalgic feel. This movie felt so PERFECT. Couldn't possibly believe that it is truly here. It has the potential of being rewatched for like a million times and that's not just an expression, this film deserves at least a million rewatches. Entertaining at every point. Just go and watch the film whenever you get the chance, you don't want to miss the theatrical experience.Thank you Marvel Studios and SonyCongratulations to Marvel Studios Spider - Man No Way Home.", "A film for the fans": "Its nor a perfect movie and it has its flaws, but the entertainmentvalue is high. If you havent seen most marvel movies chances are you think its only ok. Marvel fan, then you prob think its a good movie. If you have grown up with the original spiderman and liked them you prob think they are as good as I think. I give 1+ for nostalgia for obvious reasons.Other then that I think I hav spotted a huge plothole. Everyone forgot who Peter Parker is. But Stranges's spell seemed only to alter everyones memories. What about all the databases, security cameras, newsartickles, photage and so on? MJ for example prob have pictures of Peter on her phone. So does Ned. Does this spell effect anyone proof of Peters existence? What about the multiverse villains? Does anyone remember them? Either the spell was poorly explained or this is a huge plothole that doesnt make sense.Still, I look past this and the movie is awesome.", "Stupid teenager": "Only Goblin has done a fantastic job otherwise it has ruined everything from the return of tobey to the death of aunt may..and only one person responsible for this is that stupid teenie who thinks he is better than Dr Strange.... All the villains we know of past have been reduced to a joke apart from Goblin...Watched only for Tobey but that was not the return I was expecting...poorly handled.... waiting the multiverse of madness and see real men in action...", "Complete & Utter Nonsense - but Fun For Fans": "The trailer is disgusting: A very childish and stupid Spider-Man causes a catastrophe. The first 20 minutes of the movie are trite, cringey, nearly unbearable. Then Alfred Molina (Doc Ock) appears and the real thing starts: A meta movie made right. It's still silly, not only because of the \"parallel universes\" stuff, but for once there is an actual reward for ignoring all of that. It is some kind of recap and the perfect ending of two decades of Spider-Man movies.The great original trilogy by Sam Raimi (2002, 2004, 2007) with Tobey Maguire and the legendary villains Doc Ock & Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), the lame wanna-be trilogy by Marc Webb (2012, 2014) with Andrew Garfield, and the Spider-Man Home Edition by Jon Watts (2017, 2019, 2021), featuring Tom Holland - they all team up for a Spidey celebration. That's a very Marvel thing to do. People who have seen all of this movies will like \"No Way Home\" the most. But somebody who hasn't seen any of the Maguire or Garfield Spider-Man films? This is probably not a stand-alone movie.That's the growing problem with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where everything is connected and a galactic web of references will make it increasingly harder to just enjoy a single Marvel movie. This might very well be the last one I've ever seen. But what a great and fitting way to end the Marvel era!", "What A Thrill!!": "This is exactly what the fans have been waiting for! Not just because of the characters present but also because of what Peter goes through in the film. With aunt May's lesson and Peter (1) not killing Norman at the end. And Maguire teaching him not to do so and telling him it won't make the pain better. Getting him his redemption by helping a younger peter parker. And Andrew getting his redemption by saving MJ! There was so much about this movie that was fantastic, I would love to talk about it for hours but all in all, 10/10 movie and experience!", "Good job, Tom. You've made it.": "This movie is a masterpiece. Hear me out.It has everything any Spider-Man fan could wish for: Humour, references to the past two Spider-Man series, and drama.We got redemption arcs, second chances, and buckets of tears.This was better than any of the other films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.It was so articulately pieced together. Toward the end, every puzzle piece fell together perfectly.When all three Spider-Men came together and put their experiences together, that's when the movie became one that will go down in history.Good job, Tom. You've made it.", "Tobey Maguire": "Is real spider man.Andrew Garfield is too handsome to be spider man.Tom Holland.. haven't decided my mind yet.Enjoy watching movie but I don't get all the hypes tho...", "Wow! Terrible!": "Truly one of the worst films I have ever seen. Terribly disjointed and childish. I'm not sure why people enjoy these new Marvel films, but I, along with everyone who attended with me, was terribly bored throughout.Please save yourself the time and do not see this film.", "Best Spider-Man film in a long time!!!": "Finally there is a Spider-Man film in the MCU that lives up to the hype!!! The first two film Homecoming and Far From Home were good but not close to the level of Sam Raimi's first two Spider-Man films. The two Amazing Spider-Man films with Andrew Garfield were ok but just didn't connect with me. The two MCU Spider-Man films with Tom Holland were a step in the right direction but also just weren't that memorable. With Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man they went back to a younger, goofier vibe. Both films were very funny but not great superhero films. More comedy than action with some stakes and emotion.With a sort of messy first act No Way Home finally gave me the Spider-Man film I was waiting for. With what has become a staple of Marvel films it changes from very light and jokey to kind of dark at times. The story is very high concept with what most everybody knows from the trailers are appearances by characters from other Spider-Man films. I was worried that this would be just a gimmick and the characters would be just quick cameos but they are truly part of the story and are all given their moments. Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange is good and has a good chemistry with Tom Holland. The relationship between Peter Parker and his girlfriend MJ and Ned are central again here. Both Zendaya and Jacob Batalon are really good in their roles. Tom Holland is finally given a chance to BE Spider-Man. In the other two films he's done he was really good as Peter. Funny and awkward. But also unsure as Spider-Man. This time he really grows into the role and it great to see. The action scenes are really good but the most important thing is that I cared about what was happening on the screen. The fact that so many characters were brought back could have been a disaster but because it's more than just fan service and they are given good screen time it works well. The audience I was watching the film in was really into it. Alot if cheering. I missed that in the last almost 2 years. Watching a big blockbuster in a full theater. It was fun.The last couple of Marvel films haven't been that good. With Spider-Man: No Way Home Marvel gets back on track. In my opinion it is up there with the better MCU entries.Grade: A-", "perfect action movie": "It's a really good action movie. But a lot of people don't like it when it's a lot of fighting. But I think there's less fighting then in other marvel movies.Really interesting story with some sad and some emotional parts.In my opinion the best Marvel movie.", "Fan Service done right! The hype is real!": "To me, why this movie's fan service works and doesn't feel forced, because the core story is extremely solid. At the end of the day, this is Peter, MJ, and Ned's story, they are the anchor of the whole movie, all the fan service surrounding is just a bonus. Why fan service usually doesn't work in other movies because the core story is usually mediocre to awful with so-so character development, like Star Wars Sequel trilogy, Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City, etc. So as a result the fan service just feels random and unearned. But No Way Home finally does fan service correct because the core story is amazing and can stand on its own. This is the most character development Tom Holland's Spider-Man has ever gotten and it's done extremely well.The only reason I didn't give this a 10 because some plot convivences are just too convenient. The action scenes and fight scenes aren't bad, but aren't mind-blowing or amazing either. I can't give it a perfect score when a WAY OLDER Spider-Man movies had better fight scenes and action set pieces, most notably Tobey's Spider-Man 2. No Way Home's action scenes are a little too choppy to be considered amazing. Plus as expected, there's an overuse of CGI and it's obvious. I don't get why it's 2021 and they still overuse CGI, it just doesn't look good.Tobey's Spider-Man 2 is still the best, in my opinion. No Way Home comes EXTREMELY close though, and way worth seeing in theatres.", "The best Marvel Movie": "The story is awesome. One of the greatest marvel movie of all time along with avengers endgame the connection of stories is marvelous. Epic movie. Suprises are in the next level.", "Awesome": "Literally crazy movie, met everyone's expectations, this movie is not a big thing for non spiderman fans, but if you're following the whole buildup, you'll never get disappointed.", "Triple Spidey is just the tops": "Loved it, I really enjoyed all the Spiderman movies but this just tops it all, to have all 3 in one movie as well as some villains of the past just awesome. Nothing against the Disney Marvel Verse and Avenger however Disney is just full in your face. I felt this was more down to earth didn't try to hard and thank you Sony for making this and the true Spiderman the funny cool superhero that just wants everyone to feel the love.", "Spiderman Go away home!": "Again another dud movie of the 2020's. It's like the writers are trying to churn our as much movies that they had planned years ago before the chaos of the 2020s.... but the chaos expedited them to complete these projects half baked to get \"something\" out there to recoup costs....Anyway the latest reinteration of the Spiderman saga. Current Spiderman (lost track a decade ago).... consorts with Dr Strange to create some time warp. Which goes amuck. Opening warp gates to the other dimensions where other \"Peter Parkers\", were bitten..", "Not good.": "This movie could have been avoided if Spider-Man embraced his fame, started a social media account and accepted sponsors and other revenue producing things. And he could have just talked to the admissions committee of MIT. Not broke and an MIT student. Problems solved.Instead, he had to ask a wizard to \"make the whole world forget about him,\" a spell that is bound to have some consequences--especially if you're dealing with peoples' brains and their memories!After that, Spiderman makes stupider and stupider decisions. Like, letting bad guys free, instead of letting them go back to their designated universes. He, instead, tries to heal and cure these villains. Did those villains even want to be cured? In making these stupid decisions, he basically kills his Aunt May--no offense, Spidey--along with a lot of other people, jeopardizes the lives of others and causes, probably, MILLIONS of dollars worth in damage to property, including the property of a friend, Happy, who kindly let Spidey and his aunt stay when they no longer felt safe in their apartment. With each opportunity to do the right things (have these villains suffer their fate--the fate that they made for themselves), Peter fails, and this results in all of his friends and family forgetting who he is. He then starts a life of his own, all alone. It's very sad. He could've avoided this and/or fixed this many times during the course of this movie, saving a bunch of villains he doesn't know/doesn't know if they want to be saved, while sacrificing the lives and memories of his loved ones.And, in this movie, has anyone heard of 911? CPR? A doctor? The people in this film are supposed to be doctors, scientists, people immersed in technology and students smart enough to get into MIT.Finally, why lock up the guy who has tried to help you from the beginning and who could have been the best mentor in this throughout this whole ordeal? Geez.", "This movie is for kids": "Nothing special really, its like they just want the make up things about ups n downs in the life of a kid over n over again.For kids its fine but if you are no longer a teenager then you will find it silly.", "Spider-man's meaning": "Spider-man's \"with great power, comes great responsibility\" is originally a moral constraint on himself,This is an extremely ideal standard for saints,And when the ideal meets the reality,We must bear the consequences that are not ideal,NO WAY HOME is to present the consequences in the most serious formIn fact, only the Peter and aunt may were hurt by this moral constraint in the film from the beginning to the end (if aunt may didn't try to stop the green devil with serum, she could escape),In exchange for a second chance for the villains, the release and compensation of the previous two generations of spider man, although the cost is large, the result is good enough,But in reality, few people are willing to bear the cost to others,We will not continue to adhere to our own moral standards even if we bear this cost... If we look at it from an ideal point of view, we will feel that the person who has achieved this is a great hero,If you look at it from a realistic point of view, you will naturally feel that this person is extremely stupidBut isn't one of the meanings of the fictional comic hero's existence to fill in the goodness and justice that can't exist in reality.So i think this movie deserve 8.", "A Decent FIlm (For MARVEL, at least.)": "This movie was good with their callbacks, but just didn't hit well enough. It honestly adds nothing to the story of MARVEL, but other than that it was alright.", "Amazing movie": "Was a amazing movie. Effects were nice, cgi was enough, and acting was on point. But I didn't enjoy tobey's acting very well like they force him to play. And I personally think every 5 minute of the movie was a fan service from tasm or Sam raimy's films. But this was an great movie. My favorite in this movie was tom like he was not a kid anymore that want to play spiderman.", "Spider-Man No way home": "This contains not that important spoilers: I've said this for a few movies - but this film was the best film I've ever watched - and I mean it this time! The story was just amazing, and I loved how emotional and surprising it was! At many parts of the film, I just wanted to burst into tears. It was such good acting and I loved how they brung back the actors of the old films. Each second of this film got better. I am worried though, because Spider-Man seems it will link up with venom - which is not a good thing for me because I am not old enough to watch films with venom - so hopefully the MCU will keep Spider-Man kid friendly. All in all this was the best movie I've ever watch. <3.", "A nostalgically fun film": "No matter what generation you're apart of, whether you grew up with the original Raimi trilogy, or grew up with the Garfield duology, or if you simply enjoy the Holland new age the most, you will love this kick-ass movie.Although this film does pose a similar issue to Spider-Man 3, with a villain overload, it handles it much nicer and neater compared to the 2007 trilogy breaker. Each villain is given a genuine purpose, and none of them feel like they were thrown in there just for the sense of excitement.As for the appearance of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, it was performed beautifully. Both past Spider-Men prove they still got it, and can still play the part of Spider-Man the same way they did all those years ago. And with the frequent references and comments about their universes, it makes both Spider-Men feel authentic, as if they are genuinely the same Spider-Men we saw in the previous films.Although this film does struggle just a tiny bit from some story issues, and some very odd decisions, i.e. The decision to give Ned the ability to create portals, just like Doctor Strange, this movie overall is fantastic, and, in my opinion, is the best MCU film and one of the greatest superhero movies of all time.", "Matt Murdock": "Hey Dark Knight raises and the Batman fans, Steer clear of this,, I kinda liked only Matt Murdock cameo in this movie, wish it couldve been longer. I try hard to watch these spider man Avenger movies, but it gets on my nerve.", "Literally loved every minute": "This movie was just the perfect cinematic experience!! It was an action, comedy, love story & tragedy all rolled into one. It was nostalgic, emotional and exciting. Tom Holland plays an excellent Spiderman in his own right but the combination between the 3 (with all the back stories).. simply flawless!", "An Experiance": "Spider-Man: No Way Home may be the biggest, most anticipated movie of recent years. It surpasses endgame in everyway. This is a celebration of Spider-Man and everything he stands for. Its full of some of the best shots and moments of any MCU movie, that will be remembered for years to come. Sure some of the comedy falls a little flat, but I don't think anyone will care.The story is very well done with it being full of heart and emotion. Peter trying to save the villans is exaclty what Spider-Man would do. Mays death was handled perfectly I think, and the return of the other two spiders is done very well.This is my favourite movie to come out this year. Please watch it.", "Definitely one of the best Spider-Man films.": "I might not love this movie as much as other people (mostly because of how fast-paced it is at the beginning and a bit to catch up on and a lot to take in once the movie gets going), but I certainly thought it was great. The story was compelling and the call-backs/references were legendary (along with certain characters that returned to deliver them). I always love the Doctor Strange magic and I also thought that this was definitely Tom Holland's best movie with his Spider-Man. While very emotional and saddening toward the end, it is for sure unforgettable and I had a blast of fun. Stay for the mid-credit scene too of course!", "Definitely Worth It": "This movie seems to be pretty popular, particularly considering the number of people that were in the cinema when we went to see it. In fact, it felt as if the Rona had never happened, going by the fact that most of the sessions were sold out. Mind you, it doesn't look like I picked up the Rona then, which is good, because we still have to isolate here in Australia if that does happen (though I still wonder how many people actually abide by those rules).Anyway, the first thing that jumped out from this film was a critique of those web based news shows, which it appears that the Daily Bugle has become. Okay, from what I remember, J Jonah Jameson, was always somewhat of a sensationalist, and the Daily Bugle was always somewhat of a rag, but the MCU has certainly taken it to a new level. In fact, it is interesting seeing how the site grew through the film, no doubt having something to do with revealing Spiderman's identity. However, I couldn't help but compare him with Infowars (which I suspect was the intention), though now that I think about it, it does feel a bit more like a mainstream right wing news site.As we know from the end of the previous film, Peter Parker had just been outed as Spiderman, but we also know that this film will be leading into the Multiverse of Madness (and there was a suggestion from the previous Spiderman movie that there were alternate universes out there, even though Mysterio was pretty much a fraud).Another thing that I appreciated about this film was the world building. Sure, we know that the multiverse exists, and it has been flagged over the past couple of years, particularly with the Loki series. However, what is interesting is learning about what exists in the other worlds, and what exists in the central MCU world. I do actually wonder whether there will be any reference to Earth 616, which is the core universe for the comics, though once again this will be seen. However, it was pretty cool seeing how the other universes stack up with this one, as well as a couple of cameos, such as Matt Murdoch (though not having seen the Netflix series I didn't pick it up immediately).I did quite like the film, and as is typical with the MCU, the trailers really do end up being more teasers than anything else. Okay, I'm sure that it has been out long enough that anybody who wanted to see the film has already seen the film, but I still feel a little apprehensive in saying too much about what is going on. However, in the same vein of the previous Spiderman films (particularly the Sam Rami ones), I do appreciate the fact that this isn't a typical fight and kill the bad guy type of movie.", "Interesting, nice but foolish.": "Marvel movies are a highly entertaining performances, sometimes with elements of thinking and with interesting ideas. That's why I always give such films a maximum of 8 (9 and 10 only for \"going to the soul works\"). I wanted to give this film a 7, but objectively left it an 8, because to a greater extent it was made with high quality and was very interesting ... So why did I want to give it 7? ...because in this film appeared the #2 most stupid character of all times and Worlds, of all films and books that I have ever met (#1 Peter Quill, after what he did on Titan, and it's funny that he is also a child of Marvel).Humor, including silly humor, is an important part of such films, and often it is appropriate and funny, but specifically what Parker did during the creation of the spell by Dr. Strange is sheer stupidity....\nThe objective minus of the film and of the Peter: During the most difficult and dangerous spell, when you are asked not to interfere, when you recieve difficult concessions, and when you are asked to shut up already, he continues to voice his desires and do it not even briefly and to the point, but \"pouring out a lot of funny verbal streams\", which infuriates a lot.The subjective minus of the film and of the Peter: I hate this stupid things when \"the life of even a complete villain is important\" and \"no matter what happens to the Universe, I want to save the villain's soul\". If only he hadn't intervened and let Dr. Strange finish saving the situation, and putting everything back where it belongs, even without any changes there... Parker want to do everything ONLY! How he wants. Yes ,sure, after all, heroes should only act beautifully and liberally... and nothing else. Yes? ...infuriates a lot too....\nIn general, I was pissed off by these stupid heroic movie clich\u00e9s, but otherwise, this is a very good film. Something like this.", "Pretty average kids movie": "Fairly average movie, don't understand why anyone would rate this 10 ie best movie ever. It really isn't. Totally disjointed story (what their is of one) annoying characters and seems to be based at the younger audience to be honest. Seems as though they really need to draw a line under Spider-Man now. Nice to see the older characters again but no real point to it. Bit of a yawn.", "Best MCU SPIDERMAN MOVIE PERIOD": "Where to start ?! This is by far the best mcu spiderman movie yet.

And meddle with a spell in progress?* is Dr Strange that bored and irresponsible to agree to this?* how come Strange just leaves it up to Peter to apprehend dangerous villains after capturing a few of them himself with little effort?* how come Peter is suddenly so powerful that he can beat Sorcerer Supreme in his own element?* how come Peter is suddenly so smart that he comes up with a way to fix diverse and dangerous villains with the help of an old fabricator and a school chem lab?* and how the heck does forgetfulness spell work in the end?

I like those three elements. Tom Holland and Zendaya are good at making me believe they are those characters. Molina and Dafoe deliver solid villain performances, Garfield is ok, Maguire pales. Cumberbatch is solid. The special effects look real. I liked the fights. I had a lot of fun. Currently at 9.0 on ImdB, which is way to high. It is good, sometimes very good and even emotional, but no masterpiece.", "A Love Letter to all Spider-Man fans": "The hype was real and then some.I love every second and this is by far the greatest marvel movie yet. This fixes every single problem fans had with Tom Holland's Spider-Man. I'm so excited to see where it goes from here!10/10With great power....", "The film was absolutely AMAZING": "Tobey and Andrew's arrival was perfect. And this scene is perfect: Tom says \"May aunt say with great power\" when Tobey says \" Comes great responsibilty\"", "The most ambitious Spidey flick": "Just one word..EPIC. This movie exceeded my expectations in every way possible. The VFX, the bgm, the action sequences, and performances were amazing, especially that of Holland. Those who thought of him as Iron Man Jr. Are gonna have to reconsider it. He becomes a true spiderman in this film.And yeahh one more thing. Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin..oh boy..he was terrifying!!!Green Goblin 2021>2002.Maybe don't get your expectations high...or maybe you should?Most probably the best Spidey flick ever and I mean it..Just avoid spoilers as much as you can and enjoy!!!!!!!", "Easily Top 5 Favorite Marvel Movie": "10/10 I would love to experience watching this movie for the first time again. Watching everyone in their Marvel Gear, Sold out theatre and fans jumping, screaming and hugging each other regardless if we knew each other or not. Sam Raimi really did it with this film.", "Not the best Spider-Man movie": "The whole movie was based around a pretty far-fetched concept, even for superhero movies, with Doctor Strange making a mess and then taking a back seat. It even felt like Benedict want quite sure why he was doing what he was doing. And then the inclusion of the other Spider-Men characters felt more awkward then impressive, like the writers just wanted an excuse to put the three actors together to draw a crowd and internet memes rather than actually write a good story. Tom Holland is my favourite Spider-Man actor, but this wasn't the best of his movies.Watchable if you're a fan, but otherwise you don't lose out much by giving this one a miss.", "10 star it is not": "The opening is cringe worthy. Wet sad eyes dominate. What is it with all the crying in movies lately? The main actress can do so much better, but I'm sure it was the director. I guess its geared more to the 20 and younger audience. It was wayyyyy too long. Not worth the money or time.", "With great power comes great imbecility....I guess": "Lots of hits, but also very annoying misses.Hits:\nHow the multiverse is introduced and managed.Past characters.Production of course.Interaction between the Spidermans.Casting and Recasting.Misses:\nSpider-Man character managed to be annoyingly imbecil, because of, you know, doing the right thing. Like trying to \"save\" murderers.Instead of trying to cure these murderers to \"save\" them, maybe they could have gone to \"cure\" them to just stop them and then make them pay, just saying.This stupidity drives Dr. Strange. And he's not a character for that, he's not a teen (who are usually dumb). Excessive jokes to make the movie \"funny\" ended up making Dr. Strange look very very stupid, and that's just not his character.Overall, a very entertaining movie.", "I'm going to the theatres a lot": "I've been doing that since I was 5, I'm 30 now.Never have I ever seen such an outburst of love. The moment Tobey went on the screen, everyone just we berserk. Just shows how many grown babies, including myself, were in the audience.\"They love me\". Yes, Tobey, we do.", "Fun for MCU fans": "I'm not a fan of this series, but I think this movie delivered to the audience intended to. It was fun for the most part, but not my cup of tea. Granted, the highest rated Spider Man was with Tobey and that was a 9. 8 for this one.", "One of the Best Spiderman Movie for sure!": "Must watch this movie! No cap. The cast were outstanding, the chemistry between the characters were like chefs kiss. I am looking forward to Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness to piece the puzzle. I know it's gonna be one hell of a movie for sure.", "Without Tobey and Andrew and all the villain of prior films carry this movie": "Tom Holland has the worst trilogy out of all 3 SpiderMan. Tobey and Andrew give us fans delight, when you see Toms character you think oh god just leave please. The fans are so contradictive, when SW brings Palpatine back it's 'stupid' the most powerful Sith in the whole saga by the way. But when NWH relies on nostalgia to finish the trilogy it's better than 'The Batman' honestly marvel fans need their head checking.", "Best of the new spideys but. It perfect": "To give this movie 10/10 it has to be perfect. There were great moments and great action but there were scenes that could have executed so much better. The serious stuff was good but the less serious stuff was just boring. Overall still a really good movie but not a 10 \ud83e\udd14", "Very clever and enjoyable.": "Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)-As long as you've seen the trailer for this film, there are no spoilers in this review.It's a multiverse film, so it's fairly obvious that they will utilise elements from other Spider-Man incarnations (You must have seen Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse (2018))? It's got a lot of similarities to that.By doing that, Disney were able to do here what J. J. Abrams was very clever in doing with his reboot of 'Star Trek' (2009). This will now give them a free reign to continue with any ideas that they might have for any of the Spider-Man's or with the \"Spider-Verse\", which is great for the fans.How they do it is brilliant, if a tiny bit slow to start with. I would have liked them to have brought in the other universe characters a bit sooner, especially the allies and I think that they should have brought back the second ally first, but I suppose that's what we were expecting.Once all of the characters are in play though it is a high octane film full of the usual wit and joy that only Spidey can bring.Moving the pace forward could have given them a bit more time at the end of the film to really drive the action and allow more coverage of the people that turned up late, but regardless of that, it's definitely my favourite of Tom's three films so far.It's not a stand alone film as it literally follows on from 'Spider-Man: Far From Home' (2019) and obviously has references to 'Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame' (2018/19) too.I would suggest that you re-watch the other five (Tobey and Andrew) films or at least refresh your memory on them before viewing this one as I don't actually remember enough of 'The Amazing Spider-Man/2' (2012/14), because I thought that they were terrible and so was Andrew Garfield. He was not what I would call my version of the famous spider guy, so I've only seen them once. Give me Tom or Tobey any time (I've recently watched them again and feel that Andrew was given bad scripts, but actually delivered the character quite appropriately, I think that I was just bitter because I loved Tobey so much and didn't think that he needed replacing).As a result a lot of the references to Andrew's films were lost on me and any characters that might have been in those films were not easy to recall. I actually questioned if they had been added just to fill out this films cast, they were so forgettable.They do perhaps bring back too many bad guys too?What I really do love though is the fact that J. Jonah Jamieson has been the same in every universe. J. K. Simmons really seems to fit the character perfectly for me and it's good to see him used in a way that shows that some things are a constant and can't be changed. (He probably is Spidey in one of the original comic book \"Verses\", just to prove my theory wrong, but I haven't read enough of them to know.) I'm not sure Ned's wig was the right shade or style though.On another note, Mr Holland is simply a superb actor. Just when I feel like I'm going off of him, I see him on screen and think \"Wow, what a great performance!\" He turns anything he touches to gold. Even in his first film, 'The Impossible' (2012) as a very young lad, he gives his best, as a wonderfully emotive character, which he still brings here. I see a bright future for him.I am glad that Doctor Strange wasn't used too much in this story, as I was worried that he might have easily taken over, but this film is definitely all about Spider-Man.I also loved the fact that they brought back such memorable characters from the \"Tobey Universe\" - Doc Ock and The Green Goblin. I've always loved Mr Maguire and his Spider-Man incarnation. For me, the original three films, well let's say two actually, were more recognisable as what I personally understand of Spidey, but the current form with Tom is just very clever in moving it forward and bringing it up to date. His physical form is nice too (What? He's like 25 or something? That's legal!).The end credits scene is just a trailer full of spoilers for the next Dr Strange, so don't waste your time after the mid credits scene.I can't wait to see how they move it on now, with so much potential and this wonderful actor.902.22/1000.", "Brilliant and Unbeatable!": "I want to say thanks Marvel, thank you so much! This movie is definitively a gift for all Marvel fans.This went way beyond our imagination.I cried a couple of times watching this, and it is amazing how they connected everything without missing anything. And I enjoyed every single second.This is now my favorite superhero movie and it is somehow even better than Avengers: Endgame.", "The screenplay is a total mess": "A parade of all the characters from the Sony franchise. Good actors for nothing. The plot is null. Sony, let pay a bit more the screenwriters. This has been the my last Spiderman movie seen at cinema.", "Boring": "It was boring thats really all i can say. I m not a big Spider-man fan but i enjoy watching this kind of movies. I watched all spider man films and i can really say that this was the worst one.I don't even know why people liked it.And i don t even know how many times i have looked at my phone scrolled down on instagram while watching.All the events were developing so fast and the reasons that starting them were making absolutely nosense.Lastly i think Doctor Strange was a full of dissapointment and they could have done the last fight better.If you are not a big fan i do not recommend giving 2.30 hour to this thing from ur life.", "LOVED IT!": "Fam, WHAT. A. MOVIE! It's not perfect, you can nitpick if you'd like....but, great acting by everyone, great sound, great graphics, great action sequences. It's got everything!It has all sorts of emotions (one of the scenes had me all \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d) it has hilarious moments (A few too many and even misplaced IMO - but it's Marvel), callbacks, Easter eggs...you get the idea. That's all I want to say at this point. Don't miss this one, it adds the kind of awesomeness to the Spidey franchise the way Infinity Wars/ Endgame did for Avengers.What I really wanna know more -\nHOW does Kevin Feige plan all this?

I just wanna learn decision making from folks at Marvel, man! *slow claps*", "Best superhero movie to date": "This movie gives a fresh spin to some of the best plot points of the comics and something new. The story is well written and entertaining. There's plenty of fan services and it is done well. I would absolutely recommend this to any Spider-Man fans.", "This one gets it right!": "It's been a while since I reviewed a movie I saw at the Cinema but this one had to get my review. Loved Spider-Man since I was about 5 or 6 & that's a long 44 years of being a fan. Maguire's films were okay with 2 being the better one. Garfield's first was stellar with a darker tone & two far better leads but second was over long & a badly written Electro. Harry & his Goblin were impressive. While I enjoyed Holland's 2 films, (loved him in Civil War too) I thought they felt a little commercial & lacking the darker tone of Garfield's. No Way Home has an absolutely AMAZING cast with a really first rate storyline. While the film is long, it is very engaging. Dafoe was unreal as Osbourne, bringing many surprises. Molina was his usual outstanding self as Ock. Foxx was fantastic as Electro and Ifans was impressive as his slimy alter ego, The Lizard. Maguire & Garfield were an absolute delight, I feel as though they were very happy to don the costumes again. This is a movie I will see again in the Cinema. The last time I attended a film twice was Star trek VI The Undiscovered Country in 1991.", "A Disappointing Decline in Superhero Storytelling": "Spiderman: No Way Home is a disappointing reminder of the declining quality of superhero movies. The film lacks the heart and responsibility that defined the genre in the past and instead focuses on shallow, self-serving actions by the hero. Peter Parker's decisions and motivations are puzzlingly naive and illogical, and the logic behind the disarming of superpowers is a weak and nonsensical plot device. The concept of a multi-verse is full of inconsistencies and plot holes, and the writing is lazy and unsatisfying. The attempts to bring back characters from the old movies only serves to highlight the lack of originality and creativity in the new film. Fans of high-quality superhero movies will be disappointed by this installment and the direction that the Marvel franchise seems to be heading in. It's a shame to see such a beloved character reduced to a cheap excuse for shallow storytelling and lazy writing.", "Nostalgic and excellent story writing": "Going into this movie after hearing all the leaks and rumours, I had high expectations while also wondering how it would be possible to write this story.After seeing this movie I believe it's one of the best superhero, if not the best superhero movie I've ever seen. Seeing all the characters brought back, especially ones that I remember seeing in the original movies in the cinema when I was a teenager brought back so much nostalgia.I loved how they wrote the characters in and each one had a great on-screen appearance, none of them were cheesy. Also some of the reference to the previous movie jokes were very funny too.Overall I loved what they did with this movie and can see this becoming a classic in terms of a Marvel movie for the expectations it has set.", "Good fun despite a contrived plot": "Let's get the spoilers out of the way. The plot is a heap of nonsense designed to pull in as many actors from previous Spiderman films as possible.Apart from the plot, the film is pretty good: really spectacular action, plenty of sarcastic asides (there's even one about racial diversity in casting!), no attempt to lecture the audience on \"progressive\" values, and a reasonably hopeful ending.MCU fans (and Zendaya fans) will love it. Other folks should treat it as a respectable piece of escapism.", "This Movie needs an OSCAR": "I'm very very very hard to break and this movie got me shedding a tier \ud83d\ude2a it was amazing and dark asf not like Homecoming or Far From Home and the Twist was unexpected definitely worth it and all the references was just ..just.

Finds that perfect formula between irreverent and intelligent": "I'm not the guy to go to for another cheerleader of the MCU. I've been largely a skeptic on the sustainability of their universe building, and Easter eggs. 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' is the culmination of that approach, arguably even more so than 'Avengers Endgame'. The universe and rules have been stretched so far that they literally have broken. This is a tough sell. There is nothing more boring to me than a bloated comic book \"epic\" that spends it's entire time winking at the audience. 'No Way Home' was filled with so many potential traps but to my pleasant surprise and delight I think Director Jon Watts masterfully weaves a fun tale that has stakes. Most importantly I think 'No Way Home' is the movie that will please probably the broadest bases of movie and comic book fans that Marvel has ever ever.I feel it fair to go in with my biases. I love the character of Spider-Man and his rogue gallery. I have not loved the movies save for maybe Raimi's 'Spider-Man 2'. That isn't to say that I didn't like or love elements of the other 'Spider-Man' films. I think Dafoe's Green Goblin in the 2002 original is arguably the finest on screen Marvel villain of all time( in fact 'No Way Home' takes away the arguably). I thought Holland was a great Peter Parker but the previous entries had him merely as an appendage to the Avengers with no real identity or emotion of his own. The Andrew Garfield Spider-Man's, well I couldn't so anything nice about them but I can say nice things about Garfield now...This is a massive special effects film and all the action sequences hit the targets. But it is the characters and largely the themes that I love. 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' does what so many Marvel films cannot. It has it's eyes set on the future in an intriguing way but never does it's universe building come at the expense of the story they are currently telling. This is something that has been an Achilles heal of these comic book films( there is no worse example than Garfields' The Amazing Spider- Man 2')I feel a problem Marvel has and this maybe me being a tad harsh and cynical on the diehards is that the fans are far too forgiving of lazy writing as long as they get those Easter eggs. In the build-up to Thanos it felt like people were forgiving to sit through forty minutes of subpar writing in movies like 'Age of Ultron' or 'Thor: The Dark World' if they could see that little sliver of stone. Well, the expectation for 'No Way Home' was to bring back the legacy characters in a multiverse. If Marvel delivered I think people would have been satisfied. Marvel not only delivered however, they created a story that doesn't work without the concept of legacy. 'No Way Home' gives weight again to the phrase \"With Great Power comes Great Responsibility\" and frankly that was a phrase that had been repeated so much that I was getting a little tired of it.Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire, and Tom Holland are perfect in the film. The entire story and their dynamic is about heroism. The movie stops to take breaks from it's action for our heroes to grow and support each other. As I said the movie is about legacy and the movie bravely considers that maybe Garfield's and Maguire's iteration of the character made critical mistakes and that their mission is to save Holland and make him a better Spider-Man than even they were. In fact my biggest complaint about the movie is that it seems at it's conclusion it will make a stunningly brave choice in having Dafoe's Goblin kill Maguire's Spider-Man. What an impact that would have had! But they couldn't do it. Feige Sequelitis at work.My other nitpick is that the humor doesn't always land. The jokes are a little too meta for their own good. MJ and Ned skirt a little too much into self-referential parody and ironically they are making fun of the Raimi pictures and how \"quaint\" they seem in comparison to this. Why? I mean it's ironic that they had to bring back Raimi's universe to give this extra umphf to Holland's.I digress, 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' is a blast and shows that despite some of the traps of the Marvel formula they can make something that builds on all of their strengths.Footnote: Willem Dafoe's Goblin is a treasure. I can't state this enough.", "Greatest and Most Nostalgic Movie Ever": "Movie had all the feels and emotions to experience and was a giant love letter written to fans. It's a feel good and will have you grinning from ear to ear in most moments. But it'll always have you feel sad and heart warming. Overall it was a movie that surpassed every expectation you could ever have for a film!", "Certified Bussin": "One of the best movies I've ever seen. It's been out for 3 days and I've watched it 3 times. Tripped on Shrooms each time. I don't know how marvel, or anyone else can top this movie!", "Gift for fans": "I'm finally writing my review since I didn't have time to write it and I wanted to rewatch again first.Anyone going to watch or watched and said they didn't like and comparing with other movies must understand this is mostly a gift for fans, and for that reason it's the only movie I've ever felt excited to watch in cinema, in fact first movie I watch in cinema because I prefer waiting and watching at home, I had to watch as soon as it was released and I'm glad my country was on first release day before all spoilers flood internet, although all surprises were expected but you had to go and watch and hear all cheers.So watching as a fan gift you would be really happy, best superhero gift ever and done as it should, I feel sorry for anyone who couldn't expierence at cinema.Now if we will talk about the actual events, there's of course storyline issues, it was meant to be released after Doctor Strange at least as far as I know, which in return caused some storyline changes and things seemed out of character, Doctor Strange wouldn't cast a spell he knew very well has risks, especially for a small reason(Peter not getting accepted at MIT and didnt even try and went straight away like a child to a wizard to grant his wishes) unless he'd done before and he would be very strict about he wouldn't risk reality for a kid.For that reason, I'd hopped the movie would be longer or even better split to two parts and show that Peter life did really turn upside down and put him in real, life or death danger and everyone he cares about maybe let him have a small adventure and guidence with Daredevil/Matt who had been through similar issues like old cartoon, I actually am still hoping to see them suited up together and go aganist Kingpin and I'm sure many do even actors themselves, his scene was really very very short I almost missed out and had to rewatch again, I read that there's more in deleted scenes but still short, that would have given Peter a strong reason for him to ask for help and would have given us more of what we had wanted.There's also still confusing parts with whole multiverse concept cracking open and consequence and outcomes especially according to What If Doctor Strange episode when things has to go wrong if changes happens to events, and of course most of MCU live creations have some changes compared to comics or something completely new so I have to wait and find out, I hope it will be explained better on Doctor Strange and how this concept future will move forward and lead to.Anyway they had to push a storyline somehow because I knew they wanted Peter to finally mature, learn the leason at some point and become the spiderman we know and nothing would have been better than learning from previous spidermen acting as his older brothers, and also multiverse is probably mostly used as open gate to close some of old canceled or unfinished stories and bring any characters without disrespecting or abandoning any of old works, thats one thing I like most about Marvel, at least now, you don't have to start over with character origin or repeat characters anymore unless they have to, simply move forward or put back origins but in acurate way to move forward.Overall, once again this is a gift for fans and best expierenced at cinema, it's not as good watching at home or comparing with other superheros or Marvel creations because its a \"gift\".", "Great storyline, not a CGI fest (no spoilers)": "No spoilers here!It's a great storyline and a growing, complicated one as people try to do the right thing with unintended consequences. The only thing I would say is the storyline could've been part of multiple movies (maybe it will).", "The Best Fan service ever done triggered by nostalgia!": "Like most of their earlier popular titles this isn't something flawless or 'perfectly balanced' but still they manages to pulled it off through an effective fan service triggered by pure nostalgia. Besides some minor editing issues & few character attributes, NWH delivered almost everything it promised. For being a lifelong fan of this character(s), it's a pretty satisfying experience with a wonderfully done moving ending.Tom Holland's Spidey finally comes full circle at the end. Kudos to this young actor for delivering his best performance so far. Damn...he must be the luckiest young actor in the world right now!Moreover, I think I'd love to see a 2 hour long Green Goblin movie played by Willem Dafoe any day! This legend is a gem to watch in his every scene!I'm a 40+ old dude and today I watched it on the first show with my 7 year old daughter. We had a good time at the theater. Thing is I'm glad that I've enjoyed it thoroughly; the little kid inside me hasn't died yet and still manages to enjoy this kind of stuffs at this point of life.Keep rolling, MCU! Thanks for being there.", "My favorite Spider-Man movie": "No Way Home is my favorite Spider-Man movie and my second favorite MCU movie (I still like Infinity War a little more). I thought this was a good send-off for the first three Tom Holland movies and I'm looking forward to the future for his character.Out of the three Tom Holland movies, No Way Home is easily the best one. I had a blast from beginning to end. No Way Home had some of the best action scenes in the entire MCU. The highlights were the Doctor Strange fight and the final battle. I also loved all of the interactions between Tobey, Andrew, and Tom as well as all of the callbacks to previous movies.Besides being the most entertaining Spider-Man movie, No Way Home is also the most emotional. There were several scenes that made me emotional, like Tobey and Andrew's pep talk to Tom and when Andrew saved MJ. I give the movie props for not returning everything to the status quo at the end. I was worried that Aunt May would be revived and that everyone will be happy together, but that is not the case at all.For issues with the movie, I only have one nitpick. When Norman Osborn betrayed Peter Parker at the apartment, I thought Electro and Sandman switching sides felt too convenient. It was funny how they changed their minds so quickly. Besides that, I had no other problems with the movie.Overall, No Way Home is my favorite movie of the year. I don't care that I'm giving that spot to a superhero movie. This was easily the best movie experience I had all year. I give No Way Home a 10/10.", "Multiverse of Madness, Shame!!!": "Sorry to say but it's overhyped!!! Not a patch on Endgame, not even the best Spider-Man movie either.Ridiculous plot, previous foes dragged out from nowhere!!These characters are supposed to be intelligent but act stupid and dumb when even basic common sense says no!!!Only 2 really emotional scenes but on the whole it's just a big mess. Far too much going on and crammed in for the sake of trying to make it bigger/better than the previous movies and in fact the whole Avengers Universe.As for the reset and the end!! It feels like they have undone everything that Endgame had set up moving forward. Feels like they have taken several steps backwards instead.Hopefully they reset again in Dr Strange, doubtful but hold out hope they put this major Marvel character back where he should be.", "Hero sacrificing is most powerful moment": "No spoiler jut go and watch paisa wasul ho jayega.

Tom Holland has never been my favourite spidey coz he doesn't fit in well in that role, he just acts so dumb.. his eyes speaks confusion.. like what I am doing here in this scene.. omg for godsake please get him out of here.. he might be a good actor but he doesn't fit in this spidey role at all.If your going in to watch Spidey.. please only watch in an IMAX and for action sequences.And whoever is saying this is the best movie from Marvel, please stop there and go watch the Avengers.Finally to sum it up \"save your time\"", "What's not to love": "I mean... the ending made me sad.

Marvel Will Struggle to Top This One": "It's hard to write an adequate review of this movie without spoilers. Let's just say, bringing together characters from all three Spider-Man movie eras was masterfully pulled off. Very slick writing in this one. Great original storytelling, action, and feeling, with enough callouts to the other era films to satisfy the geek in every Spider-Man fan since 2002. Oh, and Willem Dafoe has still got it as the best Spider-Man villain ever. You will walk out of this one thoroughly entertained.", "A Love Letter To Spider-Man Fans": "This movie was outstanding. From the first minute of the movie, it starts off strong, continuing immediately after the events of Far From Home. Cameos from Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock and Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock - Venom - only made the movie a more fun experience. The story Jon Watts told with this movie showed his incredible directing, with brilliant story-telling, and an even better cast. This movie really brought together three generations' worth of Spider-Man fans perfectly. I've watched the movie twice as of 19/12/2021, and I can't find a single flaw. It is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time, even topping The Dark Knight. The only problem I had with that movie was that the action seemed a bit forced, whereas in Spider-Man: No Way Home, the action is the best I've ever seen in a movie. I've never seen a theater scream and clap louder in celebration of a specific event happening in a movie, in this movie's case, the returns of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, who all played their roles perfectly. I loved how all three Spider-Men established their differences and had enough screen time for viewers to be satisfied with. Even the humor in this movie is on-point, from Zendaya's MJ, Jacob Batalon's Ned Leeds, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange, to really everyone else in this movie, who all had the theater laughing. A lot of actors in this movie deserve awards for performances like these. Alfred Molina played Otto Octavius with as much consistency as we could have wished for, as if he had just played Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man 2 yesterday, one wouldn't think there was a 17-year wait in between. Jamie Foxx's Max Dillon really stole the show in almost every single scene that he featured in, truly redeeming Electro from that wasted performance in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. J. K. Simmons reprised his role as J. Jonah Jameson perfectly, showing his hate towards Spider-Man. You'd think Simmons was the real version of Jameson from how he knocked his role out of the park. Tom Holland, just wow. You can tell how much he's improved as an actor over the years. His acting is so good, you can hardly believe this was a fictional story - similar to Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire's acting in this movie. But most importantly, Willem Dafoe's performance in this movie was one of the best I've ever seen in my entire life - how he switched between playing a sad, old, and scared Norman Osborn, to playing a creepy, suspenseful, and evil mastermind in the Green Goblin, Dafoe absolutely crushed it and perfected the role. His acting was so good, it rivals Heath Ledger's Joker in my opinion, which for a long time, I believed to be the best cinematic performance of all time. Crazy to think its been 19 years since Dafoe last played Green Goblin, and he played it much better than he did in the original Spider-Man. According to my understanding of a few things I've read on the internet, Thomas Haden-Church and Rhys Ifans weren't available during filming and only had voice roles in this movie, and how the movie still continued to feature the Sandman and the Lizard without their actors is incredible, crazy to believe even the few seconds Flint Marko and Curt Connor's showed up in human form was re-used footage from Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man. In my opinion, the 15 seconds of swinging from all 3 Spider-Men just before the final battle to cure all the villains were the greatest 15 seconds in Marvel cinematic history. As a huge Spider-Man fan, I have been talking about this movie non-stop every single day to everyone I know for months, awaiting its release. Expectations were at an all-time high, unrealistically high, yet this movie still managed to EXCEED my exceptions. This movie consistently had me on the edge of my seat, even with its ending, which made me view its predecessors, Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home, differently. This trilogy truly encapsulated Spider-Man's origin perfectly, from having everything to having nothing - a true coming of age story. This movie was an emotional rollercoaster, from having me worried about what would happen next with Peter's identity reveal, relieved about the charges being dropped, excited with all the villain returns, sad and tearing up with Aunt May's death, on the edge of my seat with Tobey and Andrew's returns, tearing up in happiness with Andrew's redemption as he caught MJ, scared when seeing Tobey get stabbed, and then relieved with Tom's Spider-Man doing the right thing in the end, even though it meant Peter Parker had to lose in order for Spider-Man to win. Even the editing in this movie was fantastic, even for companies as big as Disney, Marvel, and Sony developing this movie together, the editing and CGI were consistently spectacular. I loved the new showcasing of Spider-sense, the battle against Dr. Strange in the Mirror Dimension, and every other scene of this movie that required editing. This is without a doubt a love letter to every Spider-Man fan, and the greatest movie I have ever watched, truly felt like an honor to have the privilege to see this in theaters. I 100% believe that this is not only the best Spider-Man movie of all time, not only the best Marvel movie, not only the best Comic Book movie, but THE greatest movie of all time. How I wish Stan Lee could have seen this.", "Spidey Three: High Standards Met With Higher Execution": "I feel obligated to write this review after seeing Doctor Strange 2 to remind myself (and others) that there are still good MCU movies post-Endgame. This is one of them.No Way Home had me and the world set with some pretty steep expectations. I was almost certain that with all of the rumors and supposed leaks that came before the film's release that there was no way (pun intended) Marvel Studies and Sony were going to be able to meet everyone's projections of this film.Well, they did. Big time.Personally, I wasn't a big fan of the first two installments of MCU's Spidey. Homecoming was average and Far from Home felt like an unnecessary teen comedy. But Jon Watts proved himself in the trilogy's closer. Which was honestly a bit of a shocker. There is such a stark contrast in the tone in this film compared to the others. Even with villains from other universes and Doctor Strange's major role, this one feels the most grounded out of the three. You empathize with Tom Holland's Peter Parker in NWH more than you did in the other films.Enough time has passed to know that Garfield and Maguire return in the third act. Pardon me if you've been living under a rock. As great as their return was (and the nostalgia that comes with it) what I was impressed with was that Tobey and Andrew didn't overshadow Tom's Spidey. They were present just enough to have a purpose for the plot but not enough to steal the spotlight.I will say though, that Garfield is one of the best parts of this movie and he deserves his third movie if he wants it.There are flaws. The film isn't perfect. The pacing is consistent but is very quick. It would've been great to slow down every once in a while and take in what the characters are feeling. This doesn't mean they aren't present in the film. They are. I'm just saying I wouldn't have minded staying inside some scenes a tad bit longer (ie. The roof scene with the three Spidey's).THIS is how you do fan service. Take notes, Star Wars. And take notes, Doctor Strange 2. Marvel and Sony gave their best at making the multiverse concept make sense. They could've taken the easy route of short-lived exposition with no substance which would've probably pleased hardcore fans just fine but they didn't. They took their time perfecting this one and giving depth and reason to why things are happening. And I want to say it has paid off. This film deserved every dollar it had coming to it.Spidey Three is a win.", "Multi-verse has been with us for a while": "Multi-verse started when Andrew Garfield took over the Spider-man franchise from Tobey Maguire, to start a new trilogy. I am not talking about the comic book sci-fi multi-verse, but the real-world cinematic multi-verse. Bringing in 5 of the best villains from previous Spider-Man movies is a double-layered realization of the concept of multi-verse.If you have read some of the critics' reviews, you would probably gather that this movie is s minefield of spoilers. I'll try to tread carefully in the trailer-revealed zone, which means that I cannot really say much that is meaningful.\"No way home\" picks up directly from where \"Far from home\" left off, with Spider-man's real identity, Peter Parker (Tom Holland), revealed to the world. The entire plotline hinges on Peter's endeavor to undo this, which only gets things from bad to worse. At Peter's besieging, Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) undertakes to cast a spell to make the world completely forget that someone by the name of Peter Parker ever existed, let alone knowing that this individual is Spider-man. All would be well (except for Peter, who voluntarily accepts this solution), but for Peter's incessant interruption, DURING the course of the spell-casting. He wants the good Dr. To make an exception of MJ, or Michelle Jones (Zendaya), then Ned (Jacob Batalon), then Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). The consequence is catastrophic. That the spell fails to work is small matter. The catastrophe is that it ends up opening a portal for villains in the multiverse to come to our world.The first 80 minutes of the movie takes us through this mayhem, through which Peter wants to \"cure\" these villains, rather than letting Strange send them back to die. Our hero is such a Good Samaritan that he goes to the extent of successfully exiling Strange temporarily to stop him from interfering. The tone and mood changes somewhat for the final hour of the movie, with the arrival of the other two Pater Parkers (as mentioned in my opening paragraph), bringing with them even more levity but also a measure of poignancy. From here on I am just going to assume that the reader has a degree of familiarity with the two previous trilogies. In fact, the more you remember, the more you will enjoy No Way Home.But first to the 5 villains (Jamie Foxx, Williem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Thomas Haden Church, Rhys Ifans), an ensemble of elite actors who have among them 1 Oscar win, 6 Oscar nominations and countless other wins and nominations. The screen time and weight given to these 5, however, are in fact quite different. I feel sorry for poor Ifans, whose face is all but recognizable in a human lizard, and truly appears for a couple of seconds after he is \"cured\". And it is highly doubtful if anybody remembers him, as I did, where he was a co-star in \"Enduring Love\" (2004), the movie that sort of debut Daniel Craig's acting ability after having been around for some time.While we are on acting ability, after Far From Home, the general reaction to Zendaya's performance, while approving, would be that she has really high bench-marks impossible to meet. The two previous MJ's, Kirsten Dunst and Emma Stone (whose character Gwen Stacey Spider-man 2 refers to, in this movie, as \"my MJ\"), are respectively Cannes and Oscar Best Actresses. No Way Home is testimony to Zendaya being right there with her two predecessors.As I mentioned, the more you remember about the two previous Spider-man trilogies, the more you would enjoy this one. When Andrew Garfield's Spider-man 2 laments that he is not up to par, the other two encourage him \"you are amazing\". Remembering that the title of Garfield's trilogy is \"The amazing Spider-man\" will doubtless bring a smile to your face. On the poignancy front, there is a scene when Tom Holland's Spider-man 3 failed to cash Michelle Jones from a lethal fall. Andrew Garfield's Spider-man 2 came to the rescue and caught her just in time. While we were cheering, we notice tears swelling in Garfield's eyes, and recall that he wasn't so lunch in his part of multi-verse in catching \"my MJ\" Gwen. With Tobey Maguire, it was of course the emotionally charged moment of bringing back the immortal \"with great power comes great responsibility\".The ultimate joy in watching No Way Home is in seeing the three generations of Spider-man bantering, commiserating, and ultimately bonding. Long live multiverse!", "Less than the sum of its parts": "With the film being delayed twice, and the resounding reception fans and a lot of critics the expectations grew. Could this really be THAT good?The answer for me was unfortunately... NoGetting old characters from other franchises could've worked if it actually bothered to somewhat develop them further, instead it solely relies on the previous iterations to make you care for these characters.Having 5 villains and 2 additional spidermen didnt help telling the story of 'our' Spiderman either, so little focus outside of a few moments are just spent on fanservice, with the original cast(outside of spiderman) being left only the beginning to actually get meaningful screentime, other than that they are mostly used for cheap one-liners which completely break any tension I might've felt from the little drama there was building.Seemingly the main character was just there to serve as an excuse to bring back better, some of the more memorable protagonists and villains.The inclusion of Dr. Strange also felt forced only for the sake of having an excuse for all of these cameos.Outside of it being pretty fun to revisit some of these characters it did nothing to make a lasting impression on me.If Maguire is THE spiderman and Garfield is the so-called amazing spiderman, then Holland is now the not so amazing spiderman.I really wish I could've just really loved this but, alas.", "This was everything I ever dreamed of": "Thank you marvel for making my dreams a reality. This was hands down one of the best movies I have ever seen. Casting, acting, writing it was 10's all around. This will forever be in my top ten favorite movies ever. This and endgame will forever stay with me. Thank you for this. This was everything.", "What a movie": "This is the far best Spider-Man movie ever. Seeing all the best villains come together in a single movie is just amazing and the way it's written can't be better.", "What a pathetic play": "What director is doing dont know not even 10% entertaining then privious Spider man movies. Goofup every where.. wasted my money and time on no story movie....", "Best Spidey Movie EVER": "This movie is honestly perfect to me, the amount of stuff in this film is incredible and it never feels like too much, This is the fitting end to Tom's Peter Parker's origin and shapes him up to being the spider-man we all know and love!Andrew & Tobey being in this movie only made the movie more enjoyable and fun and it's Andrews acting that makes his Peter Park the best on scene, that being said Tobey & Tom did fantastic and i'm in love with every version of spider-man we have gotten.", "Why to watch it": "You HAVE to watch nwh for MANY Reasons such as the characters the way they brought back villains from 2 older generations and the first two spider man's witch made the movie AMAZING and the acting in this movie is some of the best I've seen and the climax of this movie will leave you crying through out this movie you will laugh and cry and when it's over you will want to experience it for the first thing again.", "very awesome and very nostalgic": "The storyline in every second is not boring, what is very surprising is the appearance of Tobey and Andrew where they are my favorite version of Spiderman.", "Good Movie Terrible Fanbase": "Remember how people called Zack's Snyder supporters ''Snyder Cultist''? Well guess what happened.. Karma\nWas going to buy Spider Man NWH Pre ticket sale and saw a huge fight started. Also heard big fight started at NWH Pre Sale Mexico country.That's not only thing. Saw some people talking about flaws of this movie and who ever gave 10/10 to movie actually sending dead threats messages to who talking about movie flaws...\nAnd yes movie have flaws of course. Every movie have flaws. People who giving 10/10 must be max 15-16 years old and never watched movie and focused to all MCU movies.First of all first half of movie is seriously boring... really one. They probably thinked they gona use everything for second half.Second some jokes are seriously terrible. I was going to take serious the scene and was going to emotional but boom terrible joke came and my all emotions are gone.Third is empty hype. A lot of people was know both Andrew and Tobey was in. Whatever how many times Tom or Andrew denied. It was a lie. So when they appeared of course I became happy but all hype is gone before. Thx to who toke the picture of Andrew at backstage. (He needs to be fire from studio)\nFourth I actually wasn't gona say this but my few friend became annoying from movie because of stupid screams at theatre. Feels like zoo to me. Always watch the movies at night seans.Otherwise all these things. Movie was really good. Dafoe and Tobey definetely my favorite at movie. It's perfect to see Tom Holland fineally acts like Spider Man or Peter Parker. He was acting like Iron Man Jr before. That was the reason I hated both Homecoming and Far From Home. Good movie Solid movie. Recommend to everyone.", "Best Spider Man Yet!": "If you are a long time lover of the movie franchise, this is the film for you! From young to old, it has something for every fan to enjoy. You won't regret watching this movie!!", "Greatest Hits Compilation": "Stop reading reviews and go see it if you haven't. If you saw NWH already, hot dam! That was good right? Emotional, action-packed and a ton of fun. Green Goblin was awesome. If you're a spider man fan it will be difficult to not have any enjoyment out of NWH. Way to takes risks Marvel. It paid off.", "Fanfiction that's good!": "The plot doesn't make any sense whatsoever but the experience is well worth every hole! This movie is basically fanfiction but good.I grew up watching the Raimi Spider-Man movies so this was just one big nostalgia trip.The action was a lot of fun. It was very creative and intense.The performances ranged from good to amazing.Jon Watts directed the hell out of it. The movie has more personality when compared to most Marvel movies.Even though the reusing of lines from the Raimi movies was kind of cringey they still made me smile.The effects are fantastic.I actually liked Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man! He was very charismatic! I wish I felt something from the Gwen Stacy reference. It's too bad those movies were bad.It was great to see Tobey as Spider-Man and Peter Parker again! Every time he was on screen I was giddy. And he did a really good job! And as much as I love Tom Holland as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man Tobey will always be my Peter Parker and Spider-Man.I love how dark the tone is.I like how the other Peters don't overshadow Tom Holland.The rehabilitation scene was powerful.I love how they reused pieces of music from the Raimi trilogy.My favorite aspects of the film were the performances of Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina, as well as this film's iteration of the Green Goblin and Doc Ock. Dafoe hijacks the movie and just from his acting alone you feel for Norman Osborn and are terrified of the Goblin. This iteration of the Goblin is the scariest villain in any Spider-Man movie and one of the scariest Marvel villains period. Molina's portrayal of Doc Ock is just as threatening as the one he gave back in 2004. After his first line I was like, \"He's still got it!\" And what ends up happening to him was very satisfying. In fact, each character gets a satisfying conclusion. Willem Dafoe will always be my Green Goblin. And Alfred Molina will always be my Doctor Octopus.Aside from the countless plot-holes, I think the movie suffers from some pacing issues.", "Bad CGI but fantastic emotional moments": "Spiderman no way home almost made me cry. The film also actually had consequences on peters actions. Toby and andrew were actually potrayed really well and added to the plot. Tom holland does his best and doesnt fool around with great acting. Those are the things i loved but now for the things i didnt like. First of all i just want to say that if doctor strange reversed everyones memory or made them forget..what about the video footage? There would still be videos online saying he killed mysterio. I also didnt like they way they got to the emotional payoff of the movie. Dont get me wrong the emotional moments were great it was quite messy getting there. The dialogue in the first hour was also just...I dont really know if this deserved 1.89 billion dollars and i definetly dont think its a masterpice.80/100- Good.", "Why?": "Plot was all over the place and humor was at times embarrassingly bad. It was also just way too long and boring. This movie just like many other Marvel movies nowadays is just way to overrated and comes nowhere near the feeling I had watching the original Tobey Maguire Spider-man films.", "One of the Mightiest for a reason.": "This movie does it all, it's not just a spectacle appreciated by geeks of the culture, but it's also an emotional journey of peter parker himself. Regardless of the big baddies in the film, Peter Parker is still the man the story revolves around and it truly is a spider-man film because it manages to reflect on the consequences of a superhero's leaked identity. The film is also incredibly fast-paced with things happening every minute; there was never a moment where I felt that the film failed to entertain me, and as you would expect from a marvel picture there were a lot of good jokes including some only a true fan would get. Overall this movie hits it home in every aspect, all though certain things feel rushed, it just makes the movie all the more action-packed. Make sure you catch this amazing, spectacular and ultimate spider-man movie.", "Spectacular from beginning to end": "I went to the theater with mixed expectations (including possible disappointment) but I must say this movie delivered in all accounts! I dare say that it is on par with End game and Infinity war. I loved the character development of Peter but also how different stories of different characters were tied up nicely. I really appreciated the use of humour, with parts of the script hinting at the perspectives of us fans when describing certain characters. This movie has all the ingredients that are needed to deliver and meet expectations - a good balance in terms of action scenes, character development, emotions and relationships (romantic and familial), humour and seriousness, and also completeness. Well done !!", "A lot of fan service. But as it turns out, I am a fan": "No Way Home was made for the fans, by the fans.We asked for it, and we got it.It the perfect crowd-pleaser and has a lot of fan-service.I have a few problems with this film, especially with the tone, and how it pretty much doesn't have one.But you know what? Who cares!This movie will be remembered for the huge task it pulls off. Watch it as soon as you get the chance.", "Spiderman: No Way Home": "Literally... this film made me cry in the entire scenes... and shockings at the same time with extreme goosebumps that led me going back to my childhood moments when I only watch Sam Raimi's Spiderman Tobey Maguire..And after almost 14 years.

It was great to see Tobey Maguire reprising his role as Peter Parker since Spiderman 3 along with Andrew Garfield from The Amazing Spiderman 2. If your looking for Venom in this version you ain't gonna see him in this film unless you stick around at the ending credits to see Tom Hardy.

Did not live up to the hype.": "I was expecting a lot from the movie after seeing the good reviews but was left with more disappointment than satisfaction. Action scenes are the ones which make or break a superhero movie and this movie had the least action of all the marvel movies. And also the screenplay was a bit slow since the story was thin. The main positive is the nostalgia in the last 45 minutes where all the spidermans come together.

The fan service is incredible as well, and will definitely please all the marvel fans.", "Pretty nostalgic": "As a Spiderman fan from my age of 3, I was so hyped for Tobey's return. This movie had everything in it. Adventure, love, nostalgia, fun and much more. It really reminded of my younger age when I used to watch every spiderman movie at least once a week. The only thing that annoyed me was the ending ,but it's very promising for the following movie. Overall, a great movie. It really reminds you of the past and shows you how much have you grown up.", "The writing is extremely below par.": "So guess what? What took a genius like Dr Strange years of training to conjure a worm hole, Ned can do immediately and accidentally?!?Dr Strange is portrayed so out of character, they should have just changed his name/role.There's fun in this fun, but it is largely overshadowed by stupid illogical happenings and a huge lack of consequence for stupid actions taken and decisions made.", "An excellent and well-thought-out cash-in on 20 years of Spider-Man nostalgia.": "First off, if you haven't seen this movie yet, I want to warn you that there are spoilers in this review. There's no way I can talk about this movie freely without divulging key plot points. With this out of the way, I want to recognize that nostalgia played a big part in the hype for this third entry in the Tom Holland Spider-Man series. No Way Home is the kind of film that I figured could never be made due to all the different rights needed (much like Ready Player One (2018) and all its nerdy references). That Marvel and Sony pulled this off is testament to their ability to make the impossible happen.I was glad that this latest reboot of the Spider-Man franchise forewent the \"origin story\" in Homecoming (2017). Little did I know, they'd pull the same trick that Skyfall (2012) did with the James Bond franchise by putting the origin story in the third film. However, No Way Home had a lot of baggage to carry from the previous Spider-Man movies that either fizzled out or failed to be made. Bringing back villains from these previous entries was a genius move, even if it didn't fully complete the \"Sinister Six\" grouping that fans would have liked.With Marvel's introduction of the multiverse into their cinematic canon, they primed No Way Home to bring all three Spider-Men together to find the redemption they failed to obtain in their respective series. Unfortunately, the one reason I have to take a star away from my review of this movie is that they spend far too much time merely wallowing in nostalgic references. Like, I get it, these Spider-Men want to show how their experiences match, but when they're literally spending minutes on screen just quipping back-and-forth moments from the previous movies, it got me rolling my eyes and waiting for it to end. Ultimately, though, this was a strong demarcation for the Tom Holland era of the franchise, and a great action-filled movie as well.An excellent and well-thought-out cash-in on 20 years of Spider-Man nostalgia, I give Spider-Man: No Way Home 4.0 stars out of 5.", "Just action scenes, cool characters and FX": "I can't understand people rating this movie 8 or above. Yes, there is cool staff like bringing together characters of different productions, Benedict Cumberbatch and the multiverse, but that's all.The story is mediocre, the dialogues are horrible specially for the villains. It seems that writers only paid attention to one or two specific scenes, the rest seems to be written by a bot.Marvel movies are getting worse due to lazy writing and cheesy concepts, which may work for a comic but not for a modern film. If this trend continues they will end up destroying what they have built with so much effort.", "BIG RETURNS BUT STILL NOT LIKE THE SAM RAIMI FRANCHISE": "I'm not a fan of remakes and reboots. For me, the best spiderman movies are the ones with Tobey Maguire. I watched also the two amazing spidermen but I wasn't able to consider Andrew Garfield's peter/spidey enjoyable like the maguire ones. I haven't watched the Tom Holland's version yet (except this one obviously) but I can't feel like he's a good spiderman either.What I liked of this movie is the return of the actors of the first movie franchise. It was very fun, and a bit of nostalgic, seeing Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe in their old roles again. And it was very fun even the Tobey Maguire return as well even if, obviously, now is almost 50 so was a little awkard seeing him in his suit now but still enjoyable.I like also the jokes between the three spidermen about the way they create the webs. In this part the producers wanted to put together the different kind of spidermen that exists even in the comics. The ones which has to create webs with add-ons and the ones who can create them naturally.But still I don't like the multiverse system. I'd prefer the \"real world\" versions of the movies like, as I already stated, the Maguire ones and also the Garfield ones.Another thing that I liked was the \"cure\" of Doctor Octopus who came back to his old self and, in the end, help the gang of spidermen to save the day. It was nostalgic seeing doc oc talk to \"his\" spidey as a friend and not a enemy anymore.I liked also the new costume of Electro, much more similar to the videogames and comic version compared to AS2. The only one that, in my opinion, won't add much to the plot is sandman. It was not Thomas Haden Church fault (another come back from the first spideram franchise), but his role in this movie is a little bit poor.I gave a 6/10 at this movie. As I stated, I love all the returns we had but I can't stand the multiverse and the too much irrealistic Tom Holland Universe. I know that this is still a movie that came from a comic which is full of universe, magic, aliens and so on but I still prefer per much more realistic single world of the first moviesThe ending left me thinking that something was missing: everyone forget who Peter Parker is but, how in the world, they could even forget what happened in the last few days? Nothing is said about it and this, in my opinion, is a huge plot hole even if it's at the end.", "The Greatest Movie of 2021": "Great story, so many unexpected moment in this movie. Everyone who involved in this project really doing great job. And also Tom Holland's acting is top tier!!!", "Had so much potential": "It had potential to be amazing- bringing back the og's, but they quite frankly ruined the best villains with this film- it was overkill and entirely rushed. They also did Tobey a disservice in this film, quite disappointing. Not worth the hype imo.", "It's better than awesome": "Everybody got to see what they wanted to that's three Spider-Man in one movie it was awesome. It was wondrous , funny , totally loved the trio also the death of may was terrifying like no one that I know expected that would happen. Dr octopus helping Peter was really smashing. Um the only thing that really was a bit similar was the medicine to change the villains and give them the second chance that was an idea which was also used in black widow in the red room. But my grief was when MJ forgot who Peter Parker was i can't wait for another Spider-Man movie to see them together they were cute though after all the movie was splendid you would definitely wanna watch it so book ur tickets and just go watch cause why not. And the trio was so funny hilarious, comical , peculiar .", "NOT JUST A SPIDER-MAN MOVIE!!!": "Going into this film everyone's minds where racing and all the attention seemed to even draw in the unlikeliest of marvel fans.

From start to finish this movie had me on the edge of my seat it has something for every type of movie buff Whether your the hardest spider-man fan or just a casual movie watcher this movie has something for you. It has the feeling of nostalgia while keeping the more dark and serious tone this movie carried. You truely feel you are apart of the film and can feel a multitude of everything peter feels in this film. The introduction of each character is spot on and the theatre experience of this movie was enough to make this viewing of the best and maybe even tops my number one viewing experience of avengers endgame on opening night. If you like spider-man or marvel or just a good movie this is for you this film is for everyone.", "What a time to be Alive.": "Best Movie For Spider-Man Fans.

This movie won't disappoint anyone. Truly spectacular.", "Aowsome movie": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is a phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy and Holland's best outing as Spidey yet. Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.", "Surprisingly Great": "I was honestly ready for Spider-Man NWH to just be another mediocre or bad Marvel movie with some cool moments here and there like Endgame was. I'm happy to report that this is not the case. The 1st half drags a little and had some odd choices, but the 2nd half of the movie was some incredible. Willem Dafoe knocked it out of the park with his performance.", "So Many Emotions": "Wow. Just. Wow. I remember watching some type of movies and get so emotional but this movie is something else. Three spiders coming together to fight their own villains and some easter eggs in the movie was so well done. The ending was a potential for another spider-man movie, i guess. Overall, i believe this movie was the best movie in the MCU universe.", "I must admit, it's excellent fan service.": "I'll be totally honest. I'm really over the MCU. So many movies and TV shows, they all seem the same these days. The magic that they used to bring... it just doesn't seem like magic to me anymore... and this, coming from a 39 year old devout comic book GEEK. These characters literally shaped my personality and taught me about morality. It's American mythology in a way... I love it. But, in my not so popular opinion, Disney has really taken this whole MCU and turned it into an assembly line. I want to see bigger budget movies that aren't based on my beloved comics. Less of \"more of the same\".Spider-Man: No Way Home is an exception... sorta... it doesn't feel like just another MCU movie.Normally, the thought of fan service really turns me off... but there's something about this one. It's really, really well done. And it's BLATANT about it. They even tip their hats to a popular MEME (and it's hilarious). I think why this works though, is because Spider-Man is so beloved.... And let's face it, all the Spider-Man movies are mostly pretty good... except 3, but it even kind of pokes fun at that. Sam Raimi (my idol) really dialed in what a comic book movie is these days with his Spider-Man films. Even with that awful 3rd movie that was torn apart by the studio, strong arming Raimi into aiming so high ... too much too soon in my opinion. But hey, it had its moments- it's the multiverse! Let's throw it in there. The Garfield films were also great (even if the 2nd was a little over done...) and cut off too soon. But none of this matters when you're putting a movie like this together. They took the best parts of all these movies, brought it into the MCU and gave us a fresh serving. And it really works.I have to say, seeing Tobe on screen again really made me quite emotional. I know this guy has somewhat of a negative reputation these days... for being difficult and angry... but he's my Spidey you know? My first! I don't care about all that stuff when he's playing my beloved Spidey. The fact that he hung in there and did this movie meant a lot to a lot of people. It was touching. Also, Garfield was fantastic and gave once again, a funny and equally dramatic performance. Willem Defoe... almost steals the show though... again. He's so good at being Green Goblin... I love the guy. He just seems like he's having an absolute blast when he plays the character.This film also really captures the vibe of the post 80s Spider-Man comics in my opinion. It's convoluted... but somehow easy to follow and extremely fun. It's a soap opera and totally crazy! Honestly, Spider-Man's story has always been like that and even pokes fun at it... listing all the plot points in a row so we can truly realize how ridiculous it all is. This movie really embraces it and delivers it well, with MCU's terrific comedic writing. It's a great popcorn flick, and may be the best MCU movie since Doctor Strange... or whatever might be your favorite. We all have our favorites. After all, the MCU is a big, beautiful place.If the MCU can deliver more original feeling movies like this one, I might start getting excited about them again... one thing is for sure: I can't wait to see Raimi's Doctor Strange.", "Best movie of 2021 in my opinion!": "Wow, what a movie! Haven't experienced that in a cinema since pre Covid! Full of twists and surprises especially if you're a big marvel fan. Tom Holland was great so was zendaya. I'm not gonna forget this movie for a while! Try your best to watch it in the movie theatre for a great experience.", "Spiderman's Greatest Hits": "Spiderman: No Way Home (2021)Spiderman: No Way Home is a perfect super hero movie. It's got action, explosions, and comedy. It's the result of a tried and true movie making formula that Marvel has mastered. It's good fun entertainment; but, I'll never watch it again.Willem Dafoe completely outclasses every other actor in this movie. Dafoe's performance makes the others look like rank pitiful beginners. His emotional range is outstanding.The plot is an Interesting way to bring the whole spiderman franchise together and helps frame what the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is. I found it smart and creative. But, in the end, the film feels like a greatest hits Spiderman album.There is tons of novelty in this film. The banter was initially funny but got clich\u00e9 quickly. But, that's what the comics have been since I was a kid. I was more impressed with the details around the sets than the plot.Solid entertainment for short attention spans and those who like flashy special effects. Solid B movie for me.#MariosMovieReviews.", "Standards for a good movie have gotten low": "Spider-Man: No Way Home was a movie. It was a reason to get out of the house, especially considering all the buzz around it. It's the first really massive blockbuster movie to come out in years. After seeing the reviews here (8.8/10) I was expecting a cinematic masterpiece. An action movie with excellent pace, depth, story. A movie you were so immersed in you never wanted it to end, and the whole movie flies by. Dark Knight Rises kind of level. It wasn't any of those. It was just a movie.The whole movie begins under the premise of a magical spell cast by Dr. Strange to make the world forget Spiderman's identity, a spell that goes horribly wrong. How did it go wrong, what's the set-up for this entire movie? Spider-Man keeps interrupting Dr. Strange while he's casting his spell. That's the set-up for the entire movie. He keeps asking to add one more person to the exempt \"don't forget me\" list, which Dr. Strange inexplicably keeps abiding to while scolding Spider-Man for interrupting. After Spider-Man asks for \"but wait I don't want X to forget me either!\" for the 4th time, the spell goes awry and now the universe is broken. Now the movie can begin.Fast forward to the first villain to break into this universe, Dr. Octavius. He appears while Spider-Man is stalking someone who works at MIT in traffic to plead his case to get his friends into college. After a typical fight scene, Dr. O throws the car containing the college advisor off a bridge which Spider-Man eventually rescues. The advisor then walks by Dr. O, giving him a finger wag and a \"that was NOT cool!\" before apparently walking the remaining way to the airport. Just absolutely sucked whatever immersion I had from the fight scene out of me.The Villains make no sense. There's like 6 of them, the main bad guy being Green Goblin. He goes nuts and kills May and flies off about halfway through the movie. After that he's just gone until the last 15 minutes of the movie where he flies back for the Spider-Men to kill him so the movie can end. There's nothing cool, special, or harrowing about this sequence. As for the other Villains, there's no real clear understanding on what their motivations are other than to live. Which Spider-Man intends on allowing anyway.There's a lot of other thoughts in-between I could touch on, but the above alone is enough to point at and say that this movie was far from great. If you haven't seen every Spider-Man movie you wont even get the references, which I'm assuming is why this is currently so highly rated. The movie wasn't funny AND lacked immersion. Kind of like a PG-13 Deadpool without humor. The plot was contrived and there was hardly any purpose for it. Parts were visually \"cool\" enough to make you stop thinking about something else momentarily.I think that the pandemic has really lowered everyone's standards of what a good movie is, because this was not one.", "Thin story line, too little Goblin, too little Doc, too little Tobey": "The movie started being fun when Doctor Octopus was introduced and a fun fight scene ensued. This fun was cut way short by Spider-Man easily defeating Octavius with dumb nano technology. Shortly after, Goblin shows and one thinks the fun is about to kick up and this would free Octavius to fight again. Nope, the scene cuts immediately to Octavius being caught and Goblin roaming free. Very sloppy writing and editing. Furthermore, Tobey was not used enough and was portrayed as an old Spider-Man who is basically talking the whole time without any real emotion. Obviously the script was not good enough or he wasn't given enough screen time to care to show his real acting chops. Moreover, the movie focused on the terrible acting ability of the young actors making terrible smart ass jokes which are not funny to anyone over the age of 18. Too many problems in this movie. The better Spider-Man is into the spider verse. Trust me. Should have had Tobey and Doc battle it out for 30 minutes and this would have saved the movie. Trash writing. Squandered opportunity.", "You already know what kind of movie it is": "You've seen so many reviews to know that this movie is amazing. And if you somehow haven't seen the movie yet just know that this review does contains spoilers. I will let you know when this boilers come up. The action is amazing, I laughed out loud and clapped many times the experience in the theater was great people were hugging me. It was great to see people like Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina back their banter was great. Doctor strange sort of becomes Spider-Man's enemy in this movie and it's great for Benedict Cumberbatch should do that. Now I'm getting into spoiler territory I cried so much when Aunt May died it was very emotional for me and I like those kind of movies that give me an emotional connection plus even though Uncle Ben died in both universes of the other Spider-Man I still did not expect it. Speaking of the other Spider-Man even though everyone knew it was coming it would still great to see them when it did happen and their dialogue in the movie was some of the main highlights in the movie.Literally the only reason why I didn't give it a 10 is because I don't believe any movie is perfect.", "One of the GREATEST!": "Everything was so perfect. This is a big MWAH from the MCU to all Spider-man fans and not only. When they said that Endgame was nothing compared to what they had planned, it shows right here that they were not kidding. They just proved that they're capable of more. When a movie has everything in it, you have nothing else to do except to enjoy it passionately. Thank u!", "Not Bad. Very Over Hyped (5/10 is my score for average movies)": "If you have seen the trailer, you know where this movie is going. There are about 2 things in this movie that actually surprised me. This movie is special for crossing over the other live action Spider Man movies. That being said, once you get past that there is not much special about this movie.The main theme of the movie is Peter Parker facing consequences for his actions. Not very original even or a spider man movie. I'm glad I saw the movie I wasn't disappointed. Its a mile stone that we got this far. In terms of how good the movie is thoughThe other Spider verse movie is FAR superior (at least an 8/10). If your a Spiderman fan boy you'll jazz your pants. If your a regular movie watcher you'll think this movie is decently good.If characters making INCREDIBLY stupid decisions bothers you then this movie might irritate you but I was able to look past it.Also they make Jameson an Alex Jones copy for some reason.", "DC fans": "Dc fans are mad mad cuz there's a superhero movie better than the dark knightanyways its an amazing movie i watched it twice and it's still amazing and deserve the 10/10.", "SO AMAZING!!!!!!": "This movie was all around amazing. The cgi and action was really good and added a lot to the movie. This movie also got me in my feels and made me cry like three times.SPOILERS!!!!So first of all I got to see daddy Tobert. Which was amazing because I didn't expect him to be in the movie. It was pretty cool that they did the Spider-Man meme where they all are pointing at each other. There were a couple missed opportunities in my opinion that would've been cool. It would've been really cool to see J. J. J see all three of the Spider-Man's and freak out over it. It also would've been pretty cool and funny if Tobert did his little dance from Spider-Man 3. Marissa Tomei's acting was really on point in the scene where she was dying. It really had you on the edge of your seat and in the brink of tears.", "Great movie \ud83c\udf7f": "Best spider man movie ever. We want more crossover Marvel. This movie give me tears by goosebumps. Best movie of 2021. I remember 2021 by this movie. Please go and watch to your nearest cinema hall.", "It came sooooooooo close to topping endgame": "This is the best live action spiderman\nOnly thing that stops it from topping endgame is the things with maguire when he said that Harry died in his arms and that he hasn't worked in a team both statements are wrong as he and Harry worked together to stop venom and sandman and venom killed Harry which means he died in mjs lap the other things that stop it from being perfect is kirsten and gwen weren't in this I know I know gwen died but stranges spell could've fixed all that also this could've been a the way to bring Tony back but it failed in terms of everything else it's pretty dam good if you asked me to rank my top five mcu movies it goes like this5 gotg 2\n4 thor ragnarok\n3 infinity war\n2 no way home\n1 endgameI'd your a mcu fan you'll like this fine.", "Best Spider-Man movie to date. Exceeds every previous Tom Holland Trilogy and are in par with Spider-Man 2 and Into the Spider Verse.": "No Way Home are an absolute banger. They finally pull him out from his stereotypical \"Iron Boy Jr\" and make him in more similar with comic book SM. The way they deliver emotional films that isn't as mediocre as other 2 films are absolutely incredible, and i respect Sony for that.Not only that, but the way they deliver classic villains and the other 2 Spider-men (Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield) are also incredible. My favorite villains are of course William Dafoe's Green Goblin, he's absolutely good at that. Other villains are incredible too and they also make them more interesting.They also finally gave Andrew's Spider-Man a redemption by catching MJ from her death during the fall, which is very emotional considering his loss in TASM 2. The way they make the 3 work together and inspiring each other are so incredible. Other cameos that i like are Charlie Cox's Daredevil, which is now in the MCU, and alongside Vincent's Kingpin cameo on Hawkeye Episode 5, i'm very excited what they're gonna bring next. I also like the fact that Venom (or at least part of Venom) are now in the MCU.Other than that, the movie is very emotional. I'm not scared to say that this is one of the best Marvel movies of all time. It could have failed so easily but it don't. I respects the hell out of Sony and Marvel to make the movie as good as possible. I also respects the fact that they tried as hard as they can to keep spoilers off (which unironically is what this rating is).This is my review. Godspeed Spider-Man.", "Awesome but a little rushed": "10/10 hands down for the movie but if anything will do it for me, it would be how fast everything happened... I know they wanted to cram it all in within that 2.5 hour timeframe but I think if Tobey's character could've come in a bit later or in another way, it would've been better as well as the whole fight scene in general (at the end) happened very quickly and lowkey didn't like how they all forgot him (especially MJ) but I guess that's their way of closing the chapter.", "Cool and nostalgic": "Seriously at first it had a lots of exaggerating.but when I saw it was brilliant! Very good picture of them. Music was normal not too powerful. It had a bit comedy and romance(in the end). All in all marvel made it fantastic specially when they were many person.", "Best Spider-Man film yet!": "This is definitely the best spider man film yet! Sure, maybe the beginning was rushed but once they got to the multiverse stuff it was amazing! It was dark at times and it was also funny at times. Tobey and Andrew deserve sequels to their franchises but we'll probably see them again in like Secret Wars or something. Aunt May's death was heartbreaking and was the true shocking moment in the film. In my opinion, Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin was better in this film then he was in Spider Man (2002). I mean cmon, Tom Holland tried to kill him for gosh shake. I remember when people were saying like \"oh this movie will suck cause of too much fan service\" but they were able to add that and add a good story and plot at the same time so that is the really impressive. If it wasn't for Marvel Studios though this movie would be trash! Not only do I think it's the best Spider Man movie but it's also the best movie in Phase 4. If you like Marvel and Spider Man watch this movie like right now on Starz or whatever.", "The grand finale": "This was mind-blowingly fantastic.Imma do this without spoiling the movie as much as possible. Especially having watched the previous two movies. It kind of picks up from Far from Home and things make sense. The personalities and goals are clear when they should be and outcomes occur when they should occur. Crazy things happen and it ends up being a reference filled crossover, bringing back the old to interact with the new. It becomes really heartwarming when you got three of the same hero acting like brothers. They portray emotion so well in this movie also, giving depth to certain scenes and characters. It ends off with a somewhat bitter, but sweet ending though, which deeply sinks in Peter Parker's personality and has me wondering what's next in the universe of Spiderman.This has been one of the best films I've ever seen in my life. Entertaining, action packed, dramatic and feel-good fun.", "Nostalgia factor makes this an 8/10": "Nostalgic fan service makes this movie an 8. Without it, would be a 6, without Dr. Strange, movie would be a 4. Many of the jokes are too drawn out and unfunny, but a few do land later in the movie. Great to see the OT villians but everything from the Amazing pair of movies is still not very good, although Electro looked much better. Lotsa plot holes and the writing really does stretch believability here. MJ is still annoying, a bad actor and is not very pretty. Had doubts at the beginning as all the males looked like bumbling idiots, while the 2 whamen, were strong, smart and independent. Kept my interest so coulda been worse.", "The movie was just WOW": "Excellent movie that has a lot of emotional baggage. Marvel & Sony have done a nice job handling all the characters well and making sure it doesn't look meaningless like Space Jam: A New Legacy.Tom Holland delivers his best performance in this movie.The visuals were spectacular and so was the soundtrack.", "Certainly Not the Best Spiderman, but It's Solid.": "The Good: There is a lot to like with No Way Home. Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Baloton are great and have fantastic chemistry. We've never seen a Spiderman depicted on screen with a support system like this (the Avengers don't count), and it's honestly pretty fun. I also think this movie does a really good job as the \"final\" act in the trilogy and wraps up things nicely. Holland's Parker is in a very fitting place at the end of this movie, and it makes sense. (It even kind of addresses the major issue I've had with this franchise from the jump). Also, yes, it's extremely fun to see the characters we've all been excited to see.I also think they did a WAY better job integrating Doctor Strange into this movie compared to Tony Stark in Homecoming. He feels appropriately placed here, an ideological foil to Peter, who sees the world in a completely different way. They're fight midway through the movie is incredible and it's nice to see Peter use his wits to get through it.Willem Dafoe's return to the screen as the Green Goblin is absolutely incredible. He's a legitimately terrifying villain with fantastic screen presence and he basically steals the show. Holland's Spiderman has NEVER dealt with a villain like him, and I wish the film explored this more. Molina was also fantastic as Doc Ock, but again, I just felt he was lacking in screen time. I wanted more.But, the biggest surprise for me was Andrew Garfield. If this movie was meant to redeem his take on Spiderman, it succeeded. Garfield, in his relatively brief appearance, imbues his character with so much charisma and pathos, it's insane. He even outshines Maguire, whom I think most people (rightfully, imo) consider the best Spiderman put on screen.Minor shoutout, but the music is really good in this movie as well. And, I do like that this movie didn't have the big, dumb superhero CG fest battle at the end. It was much more emotionally powerful and sensical.The Bad: However, I can't deny I have some MAJOR issues with this movie, starting with pacing. The middle of this movie really drags and is entirely reliant on the joy seeing all of these characters back on screen is supposed to illicit. While I like the idea that Peter would try to save these people rather them condemn them to (likely) death sending them back to their universes, i feel like there was a bit of a wasted opportunity here.I was also kind of underwhelmed by the action scenes. None of them stuck out to me (aside from the Doctor Strange bit) and some were flat out awful (I absolutely hated the Doc Ock segment on the bridge). The only other highlight, action wise, was the fight at Happy's condo, and that was mainly because Goblin. I kind wished he didn't ditch the mask though.The Ugly: This is a behemoth of a movie. Truly, it feels like an epic event ala Infinity War and Endgame. I'd sandwich this movie firmly in the middle of those two. In some ways, I'm underwhelmed. In others, I was super impressed. It's a big, complicated movie that's overall quite good and ends this era right. And, I mean, do I really need to tell you to watch this? It's the highest grossing movie of 2021 AFTER ONE WEEKEND. You are going to see this. And you'll most likely enjoy it.", "One of the best movie spider no way home": "One of the best movie of 2021 I enjoy full movie dont wait mobile or TV it's only watching theater and everyone love this movie and tom Holland best performance \u2764", "Some people are ridiculous": "Firstly. Let's address the people here that aren't happy with the reviews of such high scores so have given the movie a one to adjust the overall.How ridiculous is that. If people want to give their opinion and it's that high then who are you to change that by giving it a one. Get a grip, it's peoples opinions and learn to accept it.As for the film. I really did think it was great. Very clever in the way it was done and opening up a new era to MCU. Action scenes were brilliant and some great emotional scenes also. Some great Easter eggs and surprises for all the fans, true fans or not.I just wish IMDB would vet these reviews with the silly scores more or it all becomes worthless. Everyone is different. And you don't have to agree. But don't be silly in how you handle it.8.5/10 for me. But can't do that score here.", "Spider-Man: No Way Home Review": "No Way Home is everything I wanted it to be. I will admit that I was hesitant about this before the film came out due to the nostalgic elements but it worked beautifully. This film isn't without fault though. Doctor Strange acts out of character here to do the spell for Peter and Ned being really good at making portals before Strange was doesn't make a lot of sense. Sandman says a line that throws a MASSIVE plot hole into Raimi's Spider-Man films. It's very obvious that the filmmakers didn't know what to do with Sandman and The Lizard. They just kinda hang out in the background and unfortunately the actors for them aren't doing a great job. I could really pick apart the plot if I wanted to but this film does so much right that I can't bring myself to do it. Electro is a massive improvement from his appearance in TASM2 and Jamie Foxx is clearly having fun with the role. Alfred Molina's Doc Ock is great and it feels like he hasn't left the role. I'm glad that he stops being a villain halfway through and has a hand in helping the hero's during the final battle. Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin steals the show. He ended up being my absolute favorite MCU villain. Dafoe steps back into his Goblin shoes flawless. His performance can be absolutely terrifying at points. In the apartment scene where he fights Tom Holland, the score becomes incredibly haunting as Holland lands blow after blow while Dafoe laughs manically. It's haunting and amazing. Speaking of the score, it's absolutely fantastic. It adds so much emotion to the story and helps with the grand feeling. The light motifs for each character works brilliantly when thrown into the scene. The biggest strength this film has is the death of Aunt May and the return of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's Spider-Men. Aunt May's death came out of nowhere and really hit hard when she dies in Peter's arms. It's a brilliant scene. Tobey and Andrew step back into the suit perfectly with Andrew Garfield being the best part of the film in my opinion. Both of them bring back their quirks of their Spider-Men and they have their own little redemption moments. Tobey saves Goblin from being stabbed by Tom's Spider-Man and Andrew saves MJ from death in an absolutely beautiful scene and brilliant performance from Garfield. It almost made me cry to watch Garfield realize that he had redeemed himself and saved someone but in the end, this is Holland's film and he goes through Hell in this. He loses his aunt and in the end, everyone forgets who he is and it's brilliant. Holland finally shines in his best performance as Spider-Man here. It's heartbreaking to see him go through all of this but in the end, when he loses everyone, he looks on the bright side and continues being Spider-Man. It's what his aunt and friends would want him to do. He makes his own custom suit and swings out to continue being Spider-Man and in that moment, Tom Holland became his own Spider-Man. This film does so much right and I would HIGHLY recommend watching this as soon as possible.", "Fanservice Done Right": "Note: The Spider-Men will be referred to by their actor's names.No Way Home was different from other movies in the sense that things that would usually be considered spoilers were so thoroughly leaked that key details of the movie were universally known months before release. The idea that this would be a multiverse movie with Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man and Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man and their villains returning was backed by leaks and reinforced by a whole host of memes going back to the Spring. In a strange way, the leaks helped the movie. While Tobey and Andrew appearing out of the blue would've been one of the most stunning surprises in movie history, the villains appearing would've spoiled it and it would've been hard to market the movie without multiverse characters. Until they appear, there's a certain amount of tension in every scene, wondering if the reunion with Tobey and Andrew is right around the corner.A movie as fanservice filled as this is a tall order to make right, but it succeeded. For that to happen, Tobey, Andrew, and their villains need to meaningfully contribute to the movie, both in regard to giving them a satisfactory update and/or conclusion and also work for Tom's arc. They succeed. Andrew got some degree of closure, and even mocked his status as the least popular. That scene with him and MJ was perfect. Tobey didn't get as much, but it was definitely a pleasure to see him. Most importantly, the two of them are sort of mentor figures for Tom, voices of reason when he begins to stray. Some of the best parts of the movie are the little scenes of dialogue between the three of them. For the villains, it kind of works, mostly on a case-by-case basis. Doc Ock was probably the best one. Sandman and Lizard were mostly there to be there.There is, in fact, a whole movie here that isn't about the multiverse characters. It does begin with Tom reeling from the effects of Far From Home's ending. Wanting to make people forget he's Spider-Man, he gets Doctor Strange to cast an extremely powerful spell that opens up the multiverse. In the previous MCU movies, Tom was the kid of the bunch. With this movie and how it ends, he really grows up significantly from where he was in Civil War and Homecoming. It finishes the high school aspect of this, as that's been a part of who he is up to this point. The acting in this movie is surprisingly good, especially from Tom. Of the villains, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Jamie Foxx were the best.There are, of course, some things it does wrong. Daredevil was hyped up by leakers, but he only has one scene. What's the point of bringing him in if he's barely going to do anything for a plotline that goes nowhere? The attempted redemption arc for the villains, with the exceptions of Doc Ock and Electro, felt cheap. While Dafoe was awesome, the Green Goblin character arc is either a cheap cop-out or completely self-contradictory with Aunt May's ideas. The tie-in with Venom was disappointing and didn't seem to make much sense in No Way Home's overall story. While the whole thing with the Spider-Men discussing what is means for them to be Spider-Man is a great scene, Spider-Verse did it better.While it doesn't affect the movie's score, it is worth noting the movie's financial success despite coming out at the time it did was remarkable. Usually, I hate it when people clap or cheer in movie theaters, but in this case it's been so long that I welcomed it. And as someone who was a little kid with Spider-Man with Tobey Maguire as his first PG-13 rated movie, I myself gave a big round of applause when he came on screen. There's something bittersweet about it. I remember being so disappointed when Spider-Man 4 got cancelled back in the day, and this was the closest I'll ever get to that.", "Just Amazing": "I dont know if it was the vibe in the cinema, the amazing CGi, the very unique action sequences, or the nostalgic moments i lived.

It was a cinematic masterpiece that gave so much nostalgia. The inner child in me came out and I really felt like such a giddy kid at Disney world. I grew up watching all the Spider-Man movies as a kid, and of course Tobey Maguire was my favorite. He's the og and he's the reason I absolutely adore Spider-Man. Then Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man movies came out and I loved those just as much, but of course I hated the ending in the second one. Now on to Tom Holland's Spider-Man, and I have to say, he's incredibly good. He nailed that role. All of them are so amazing and play such a unique Spider-Man.", "Yes this is what we wanna see": "This is an awesome movie, I love how they brought all the spider-man and villains in one single movie. I am glad that all these actors accepted to play in one movie later all together, really cool thing.I can't wait to see more movies of the spider-man universe. I love when they add other marvel characters in the movies, I hope they do it again for the other movies and add again other marvel characters into it like they did with Dr. Strange and Wong.Special effects and acting were pretty good, the movie was not too short but also not too long, somehow the perfect length. If you haven't watch it yet, watch it, you won't regret it.", "Not a action movie fan but this is cute": "Spiderman is kinda the only action hero movie I watch. As always this movie has enough light hearted moments to draw me in. Tho I'm not really buying Tom Holland's charm. And Zendaya playing this supportive girlfriend thing is very unconvincing to me as I've seen what she's capable of in Euphoria.None the less, I do really like that the 3 Peters join hands this time.

Other than that, it did not stand out to me.The \"meta-joke\" on the other reboots is an interesting idea but that's pretty much the only original part of it.It's really just another Marvel superhero movie. Not horrible, but not outstanding either.", "nice one marvel!": "After a few days of thinking and considering, I think this movie deserve of 11/10 if you are a big spider man fan, because it's include a lots of fan-service that can break the cinema immediately. Beside that, the way marvel develop spider man in the MCU is on another level and i'll not say the reason because it's contain spoilers. Other than that, everythings in this film is pretty normal i guess, the tempo is fine,the content in this film is just like other marvel film and have no improvement, CGI sometime feels very fake and the final battle is disasstified me.

This movie seriously had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Wild action along side interlinking prequels created an abundance of excitement and thrill. Although seeing all the previous Spider-man movies is not necessary to enjoy the film, including other franchised releases, it does bring that extra element of surprise and connection if you have.I would recommend this movie for all ages, especially anyone who loves a good Marvel extravaganza!", "Good, But Not Great": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is Marvel Studios' attempt at introducing previous Spider-Man franchises into the MCU Canon. The first half of the movie is boring, has choppy editing, the story wasn't coherent, and it was downright silly at times. The second half was better, but not enough to hold up the movie, and personally, I did not enjoy it very much. However, the ending is actually quite emotional, and fixed a major problem with the MCU Spider-Man. So overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a good, but not great, Spider-Man film which will be pleasing for fans but was not worth the hype.", "I'd Watch Again": "Best Spider-Man yet but can Tom learn some basic first aid and life saving techniques.

Well, if you can do that, then why are you having problems?As always, these latest Marvel movies go way too far in the powers they give their heroes, to the point it's impossible to believe they could have problems. This makes me unable to get sucked into the movie on-a \"how would you solve this\" hook so I'm just sitting there waiting for the inevitable end of the movie where I know the girl and the guy both survive.If you like watching explosions, buildings getting smashed, people ping-ponging around at the speed of sound then by all means, enjoy yourself.Me?

We all caught in this powerful spider(man) web...\nEach one has done a brilliant performance.Disappointed though as expected a powerful action when all 3 spiders joined together for a final win...it was less action to me but a pakka n sema action spider this is... We all loved it!!", "Twitter already spoiled this": "Spider-Man: \"No Way Home\" is another example of how the internet is ruining the world. Maybe not quite as good of an example as your average day on Twitter and Facebook, but the internet ruined this film. While the movie was acceptably entertaining, all of the big twists and turns had been long leaked online. Watching it felt more like an opportunity to confirm if the sites you read are telling the truth or not.The pace of the film was somewhat slow until the final 30 minutes. The 2 hour and 28 minute run time could have easily been 1 hour. This film did very little to advance the overall MCU other than set up Doctor Strange 2. It tries too hard to be jokey, and most of the jokes fall flat. It also has an odd amount of silence, as if they ran out of budget to have a movie score produced (you underestimate the effect of music in a film until there is too much silence).With all that said this was a decent film. It's far from an \"Infinity War\" sized epic. It almost felt less professionally produced than the Disney + shows.Go see this one, but temper your expectations. It's nothing greater than the third-best Tom Holland Spider-Man film.", "Hands down, BEST MCU movie out PERIOD !!": "I absolutely LOVED THIS MOVIE .. I wish I could share why without Spoilers .. but , trust me when I say.. this movie will slap a huge cheesy Grin on your face :):) Enjoy the flick.", "SUCH AN EMOTIONAL YET AWESOME ROLLER COASTER RIDE!": "WOW!!! What an experience. This film was adventurous, hilarious, moving, and thought-provoking. This film is another example of why the character of Peter Parker/Spider-Man is so universally beloved. This character is the most relatable and multi-layered superhero. He shows that we all have struggles, we all go through pain, and we all make mistakes. Yet, he also shows that it's important to never give up, never let horrible events change you negatively, and do the right thing.9/10.", "A Great Character Driven Movie": "A great movie with some phenomenal acting from all the actors involved. Willem Dafoe as usual killed it as the Goblin. It was great to see him in this role. And all three Spider-Men were great. Tom Holland is maybe my favourite Spiderman after this movie. His acting is phenomenal and the character development that he goes through in this film has put him up in the contention with Toby in my eyes.I disliked him previously because he was a little immature, but maybe I was missing the point completely. Maybe it was like that by design, he had to face a tragic loss and I think in this universe his Uncle Ben doesn't count as that big a loss as it does in other universes. He had to face a loss of someone he loved in order to grow and not just Tony but in this film as Aunt May dies with the all popular quote originally said by uncle Ben \"With great power, there comes a great responsibility.\" Tom Holland's Peter Parker finally reaches that push into the mature life.It is a great character driven movie with a lot of high spots and cameos from different universes. But one of the things it lacked was that it couldn't give justice to every character and story they were telling in the movie. I felt that the story didn't get much time to breath and moved to fast. The villain suddenly became good because they are just \"cured\". Doc Ock's character doesnt get much time after he was cured I felt it was too rushed. Doctor Strange felt to me a little out of character. I didn't see him this irresponsible to cast out multiple spells just to entertain Peter's request. I also didn't like this superhero character trope of saving everyone. I think as a hero it is one of the best thing to realise that you cannot save everyone especially those who feel like they don't need saving. I feel that is what Toby realizes in his first fight with Osborne as he fails to save the Goblin who had to die as a villain. And the last negative I will point out will be the cameos for the sake of cameos. Yes, I loved Toby and Andrew as Spider-Man and I jumped out of my seat seeing them in this universe in that uniform again. But at the end I just felt they didn't have much to give in the larger story. And yeah you can argue that they helped Tom Holland's character as he is going through a great loss of his Aunt May, and that's fair. This movie definitely didn't need these much villains I don't think any villain get much time to breath except Goblin who was indeed the \"final boss\" of the movie.That being said I loved the growth Holland's Spider-Man goes through in this movie and in the end I loved how he sew his own suit with classic red and blue colours symbolising the same. He is no longer a Spider-Man who relies on the high-tech suit. He can rely on his ability. As Stark had said to him \"If you are nothing without the suit, then you shouldn't have it.\" And now he is finally something without the suit, he is the Spider man Toby and Andrew was. Loved it.Great acting. Great character development. Great fight scenes with all three spideys fighting side by side.", "Emotions...": "I laughed, I cried, I gasped, I cheered... what a tribute to all the work of Spiderman that came before it! However, I have to ask myself, would I have felt such a range of emotions if I hadn't been such an invested Marvel fan? Likely not.My only gripe? Killing off Aunt Mae! I know, I know, Spiderman has to have his family killed off, but why get rid of the amazing character that Marisa Tomei is?! Foolishness...", "I liked it - for many reasons.": "Boy, was I bumbed out after I heard there will be ANOTHER instalment of Spider-Man. Yet, up until this point it was weaved very decently into the current MCU.But this movie did something that clever, that I really had to smile when it unfolded.I actually hated the first half - because it all seemed very \"constructed\", just to have a problem. But the second made up for all that drag at the beginning.A splendid idea, great execution and quite a bag full of pleasant surprises in this one.", "The comic book Spiderman returns": "An excellent movie with excellent star cast and excellent way of story telling. Spiderman NWH hits the right chores in many different ways. Thanks to the nostalgia associated with Spiderman from 2002. The movie delves into the Spiderverse in a beautiful way. Couldn't have asked for a better movie for Spiderman from Marvel. Totally brilliant.", "Too Predictable": "This movie was a one and done for me. Once you know who comes in when, it gets boring. I thought the movie was too predictable. People in the audience gasped at times but before they did, I knew what was going to happen. Also, if you haven't seen the other movies, it loses value. I'm not up to date on this younger generation but my first Spider-Man was Toby Maguire. This movie is ALL ABOUT CAMEOS and I don't know how many of this younger generation would know who these people are. The only thing I loved was 2 cameos and Michael Giacchino's music where he used: Hans Zimmer, James Horner and Danny Elfmen Spider-Man themes to add to the cameos. I know a lot of people love this movie but it wasn't for me.", "Best spiderman movie ever made hatsoff!!": "On 16 December 2021 I step into theatre with so much exitement & it gives everything what we expected even more all I can say don't miss out this masterpiece this is the best spiderman movie ever made love every second of it!!!", "One for the kids in us": "First of all let me say this: this movie without Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield and their villains would have been generic. But adding them brought back a lot of nostalgia.Willem Dafoe is brilliant, Toby and Andrew the same. So many references to the old spiderman movies done extremely well, acting top notch. It brought back the nostalgia for me as a kid with Tobey's spiderman and then as a teen with Andrew.For me, this is the best Marvel/Sony film made up to date. Bringing 3 spiderman's together and doing it right, fantastic.", "Trying to resolve the issues": "Extremely entertaining but I need some questions resolved before I can really get behind this movie. (Gosh, I miss when IMDb had message boards, so you all could share your thoughts...!)Spoilers for Spider-Man AND other MCU properties to follow....A lot of people are trying to make sense of how Doctor Strange misspoke about what actually happened to all the villains who appear in this movie (which ones died, which ones died fighting Spider-Man, which ones knew Spider-Man's identity, etc.). Clearly more characters came in than just ones who died fighting Spider-Man, and the way I \"head-canon\" all this is by surmising that the ending of Loki (the streaming show) must also have a bearing here. I mean, how can it not? I know the ending of Loki is technically a breakage of the timeline, but in a way that's one type of multiversal enabler, and it seems very strange to me that the MCU would have both, unless one weakened the stability of reality and the flow of time, to make way for the other.I'm also trying to figure out, exactly what was the spell at the end? For one thing, we have to convince ourselves it was necessary, even though the multiversal cracks in the sky sure seemed to have calmed down already. But what did the spell accomplish? If it only caused people to forget both Peter Parker and Spider-Man, was it just forgetting the shared experiences, or was it forgetting the entire existence of both? And what happened to all the evidence (videos, newscasts, social media posts, etc.) that confirmed the identity? Were those erased too? When the Avengers would have remembered fighting alongside Spider-Man, do they have a complete memory block that he was present, or is his face just amorphous in their minds now?Those are my biggest questions, among many, story-wise. But I also have a production question. When they were editing this movie, why did they leave so much dead air? There are a lot of awkward silences, and I don't know if they were trying to leave space for audience reactions to die down (like the cast of a play will do) or if they were embracing the current popularity of cringe comedy (of which I'm not a fan). This was a detractor for me, to really get into the film.", "BEST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE!": "SPIDER-MAN NO WAY HOME IS THE BEST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE OF ALL TIME.

I had THAT low expectations lol. But WOW what a phenomenal movie. Easily Tom Holland's best acting yet.So many amazing moments, one-liners and graphics. I was not waiting to be so moved throughout the movie. It was such an emotional ride. Starting of as the same as other marvel movies it suddenly took a more emotional spin, which pushed it really over te edge for me.For every fan of the MCU or Spiderman or just well made movies I would like to say GO WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE. You will not be disappointed. Easily in the top 5 of best MCU movies. Can't wait for the story of our friendly-neighbourhood-spiderman to continue :)", "7/10 for nostalgia, definitely not for plot": "So that I don't post any spoilers I'll just say they checked all the boxes for nostalgia but holy hell the plot holes. So disappointed in the weak plot and multiple plot holes. I expected more.", "OVERHYPED, OVERRATED AND CATERED AROUND NOSTALGIA.": "Alright hear me out. I've already watched top 100+ movies of IMDb so I could say I'm pretty much a film junkie compared to most reviewers here.Spiderman (2002) was my one of my first live-action superhero films that I watched along with Superman and Batman films. I had watched all trailers of this film, as well as the Spider-Man prequels and its past portrayals. And like most film audience I had better hopes for this film compared to its prequels. And as I watch it I was saying \"boy this story is rather simple and underwhelmingly bad\".There were three things I had mixed reactions with on this film: PLOT, CONFLICT, and CHARACTERS.1.) PLOT. The issue with this film was its SIMPLE, SHALLOW and BADLY written plot. If I was to simplify its plot it would be: Tom's identity was revealed that's why he and his friends couldn't go to college so he asked Strange to brainwash everyone and make every other people forget his identity. And that's it. Not the reason of his friends and family were endangered by his identity, not because he's too stressed of the attention and bad publication but because of their education??Take out everything else in this film: the villains, the other Spidermen and what do you get? Just a silly plot. Remove all the filters and focus on the actual substance of this film and you'll notice the plot was messed up and shallow in the first place.And ultimately because of immaturity and stupidity of Tom messing around Strange's spells that this film had a conflict with the villains-That's just lazy writing.Also, the whole idea of bringing back the villains to their universes alive was also problematic and it felt not a smart move for Tom. I know Spiderman is your life preserver hero but Tom just met these possibly dangerous people, he didn't fully know these people to actually make decisions that would affect their respective universes.2.) CONFLICT(s). Alright. Did this film actually had a conflict? Yes, and it's a silly one- that was they couldn't go to college. The villains were just minor bump in the story. Was the conflict resolved in the end? Yes but in an unsatisfying and silly way, like okay Strange could've just brainwashed people and turned their memories of Spiderman into a favorable ones but erasing it completely was the only way!?3.) CHARACTERS. Most characters were underutilized and out of character especially the villains. Think of it, this movie would've been finished in an hour if only Tom didn't stupidly messed up Strange's spell.My issue with this film's characters are they acted out of their character or out of reason and logic. Peter acted quite childish and irresponsible while with Dr Strange and it felt little annoying. Villains were underutilized and their motives were unclear. The writer also tried to made them funny but I guess it didn't work for me and it felt forced. The villains' hostility was flipflopping and it felt out of character. Like a minute. They were just bewildered but calm and understanding but just because of silly little devil's advocate play by GG then suddenly they became hostiles and murdering people?? And at the end when the villains were neutralized they were just left off screen without much to say or do and it felt like nothing happened.Props to Dafoes' great acting though, but apart from that his character is also problematic.Apart from these things the film was riddled with plot conveniences and plot holes. Like how they easily and miraculously built \"cure\" that works for everyone, I know Peter(s) is quite talented and intelligent but this is just lazy writing. Effects of Strange's spell is also unclear and questionable like if people's memories of Peter were erased, what are the repercussions of this? What if they have a picture with Peter, how about Peter's classmates that and his schools that had documents of him? What happened to the daily bugle mega news about Spiderman's identity were all the articles, pictures and videos just magically vanished too? If only the people's memories of Peter were erased wouldn't his friends be asking the origin of events why they're in the Statue of Liberty? Would Ned be remembering he's able to use magic but not remember the villains and other Spidermen?Overall, the action was quite good 7/10. Drama was decent 7/10. Comedy was okay I guess 6/10. Story writing was a mess 5/10.", "Good, not great!": "Movie had all the necessary ingredients for a great movie but missed the mark on many scenes.The movie felt rushed with all the villain scenes because they did not get enough time to flourish into a good story. It was paying lip service to the villains.The Spider-Man scenes were the best and it definitely felt like a Spider-Man movie.The Dr Strange scenes are good. MJ thanks was also good in her role as a strong support.The movie could have been improved in many ways but definitely worth the watch.", "No Way Home": "No way home is an example of how a fan service for fans should be designed. All the villains are perfectly matched, the stupid Goblin mask is removed and he has acquired a more spectacular look. The story of Aunt May and Uncle Ben is done wisely, and here you really get into death. Does the doctor spoil all the raspberries with his superpowers? No, because we don't know their limits, and we have to take his word for it.The curse of the movie spider was gracefully bypassed when 5 villains were dragged into the film, but in the end the fights came out 1 on 1. How so? Watch the movie.Even the idea of a multiverse, which usually serves as an excuse for any heresy, is appropriate and very necessary here.", "A Solid Film To Close Out 2021": "Watched Spider-Man: No Way Home with Tom Holland(Avengers Endgame) as Peter Parker/Spider-man, Zendaya(Euphoria) as Michelle Jones ,Jacob Batalon(North Woods) as Ned,Marisa Tomei (The Wrestler) as Aunt May ,Jon Favreau(Iron Man) as Happy Hogan, Tony Revolori(The Grand Budapest Hotel) as Flash Thompson , Benedict Cumberbatch(Avengers Infinity War) as Doctor Strange, Rhys Ifans(Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 1) as Dr. Curt Connors/Lizard ,Alfred Molina(Indiana Jones And The Raiders of The Lost Ark) as Doctor Octopus, Willem Dafoe(Shadow Of A Vampire) as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, Jamie Foxx(Django Unchained) as Max Dillion/Electro, Thomas Haden Church(Spider-Man 3) as Clint Marko/Sandman.I really enjoyed this film while i hope this is the last time Peter is tied from any outside any MCU Character also the whole Multiverse plays a pivotal role in this film tying it to Loki and Shang Chi which was great also bringing in The Rogues Gallery from Maguires and Garfields Spider-verses therefore \"canonizing\" them into the MCU also and paving the way for Miles Morales into the MCU also it handled Mysterios ousting of peter parkers identity really well i really enjoyed the nostalgia of This film as well a Solid Film To Close Out 2021 Not the best though of 2021.Great Music By Michael Giacchino(Jurassic World:Fallen Kingdom), and Direction By Jon Watts(Spider-Man:Far From Home) A Solid Film To Close Out 2021 9/10.", "Best Marvel movie I've watched": "(I only didn't watch Eternals)\nA great Spiderman movie. A great superhero movie. A fantastic Marvel movie. A good movie.I enjoyed watching it and I will watch it again and again.", "Best Spider-Man movie of all time": "Holy crap this movie lives up to the hype this is one of the greatest movies of all time and if you hate this you are not a true Spider-Man I was just shock on how this movie was I knew it would be amazing but it was spectacular and stay for the 2 post credit scenes they are awesome and wow just have no words best Spider-Man movie of all time.", "T-Mobile Tuesday": "At first it was just me and 2 other people in the theatre, by the time the trailers finished, place was 3/4 full... I don't know how many people were there because of the \"2-2-22\" T-Mobile perk... All I know is that I have wanted to see this since it was released, and I was offered a perk, so I jumped on it.It occurred to me that the theater that I was in was the exact theater that I was in 20 years ago during the first Spider-Man movie... so it was totally appropriate that this film included elements and characters from the first trilogy and the second duology...I never thought the second set of Spider-Man movies was that bad, I always thought Andrew Garfield did a good job.The Tom Holland spidey starts off here with his own set of problems of course, caused by an \"Even Worse\" and partially hair-challenged J Jonah Jameson who was introduced at the end of the previous Spidey film.Ironically, however: this movie plugs in to the Multiverse idea that has been explored in WandaVision and Loki, which appears to be the main gist of the next Doctor Strange movie.Watching comic book based movies today is like collecting comic books, back in the days when I collected. These are no longer self-contained films, just like they were not self-contained issues of the titles I collected. They all \"crossover\" into themselves. I still have many of my marvel crossover trade paperbacks including my X-Men Phoenix and Dark Pheonix sagas, Phalanx Covenant, Days of Future Past and Present. After the tail end of the swath of destruction left by the Infinity Wars, it appears that these films are even more interconnected.Plus it was great to see crooks that were part of the first sets of movies, and some of those characters even reminiscing about details from those films.But for those who would blame Peter Parker for all of these conundrums, you have to remember it wasn't just his fault, the female Loki variant had a lot to do with this big mess as well. That's all I can actually say about it. Before you go see this it would be a good idea to watch everything that leads up to Endgame, including the Spider-Man title previous to this one, the three Sam Raimi Spider-Man films, as well as the two Garfield films... It's the only way to stay sane, and it is the only way any of this will make sense.I suppose a lot of people were writing reviews about this film and mine got hung up in the queue... and of course I will be getting nonhelpful votes because I liked this movie.", "The best Spiderman movie": "I'm a self confessed Bully McGuire fan but I've got to admit this is the best Spiderman movie of the lot. Absolute genius idea to bring all 3 spidermen together and have them fighting nostalgic foes of the past.The film is more than that though. With a witty script and Great side kicks in MJ and Ned. Aunt May is the best Aunt May and her relationship with Happy provides plenty of laughs. Tom Holland is excellent (again), and Willem Defoe reprises the perfect commic book villain in the Green Gobblin.", "Highly enjoyable! Totally loved it!!!": "When this film hit 1 billion income on Box Office, I didn't think it would be this great. I thought it was just better than previous films. But after I watched, it literally blew my mind. OMG!!! It was so great. So much fun and excitement. It's really a great film.I hate to write long reviews. So, I'm going to make it short. The only thing I want to emphasize here is that I'm happy to see three Spider-Mans in this film, especially Tobey Maguire. Tobey Maguire version of Spider-Man was the very first one I've ever watched. Too bad that there's no chance to see him after three films. But seeing him in this film made me think of the first time I watched his film. That's why I liked to see him in this film. He reminded me my childhood days.As for me, to point out bad things, I have many words. But to describe good things, I don't have anything but the word great. So, I'm going to say it in short version. This film is great. The acting is great. The original score is great. Everything in this film is great. So, the film turned out to be great even though I'm not that much fan of multiverse thing but I'm indeed a Spider-Man fan.All in all, Spider-Man: No Way Home is one of the best films I've watched in my entire life and one of my favourite films of all time.

Being a hardcode Spidey fan, couldn't have asked for more. Holly Molly, what a MONSTROUS ride man, It got everything right from the word go till the last frame. Whole theatre erupted with loud cheers, shouts for every 5-10 minutes and continued till the end. Kudos to Jon for churning out a movie like this and sustaining the momentum throughout by giving nostalgic fan service moments. It just went with the flow and all the key cameo roles got a smooth entry into the movie and didn't feel like they added it for the sake of adding , which is indeed a big achievement. VFX is spectacular, especially the bridge scene and mirror dimension sequences are astonishing.Charlie Cox got a huge non stop roar, such is the impact he created and so happy for him, cant wait to see him in action . Grew up watching Tobey's Spider-man and then to Andrew's Amazing Spiderman and next to Tom Holland's Spidey iteration. All three got their own unique style in portraying the role and did their best to carry the legacy. Seeing these guys together on the screen talking, exchanging banters, having a bro time and web swinging is nothing less than a TRUE CINEMATIC MOMENT. All the sequences and conversations pertaining to 3 spidey's are well written, crafted and shot. Tobey and Tom praising Andrew as \" amazing \" is a well deserved one. Saving Mj is one of the best moments in the movie and following Andrews emotional happiness is precious. I was literally smiling and brimming with joy the whole time looking at them like a kid who got his first candy taste.There are people who hated Tom's Spiderman version but, this time he gonna make you fall in love with him with his act. The character Growth , maturity . Emotional connect he got in this flick is amazing. Despite Andrew's , Strange and Tobey's presence , Tom managed to stand tall and shouldered the movie, phenomenal. Chemistry between Zendaya and Tom is endearing. All the villains did their part but Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin act is crazy and dope, just wow.Multiverse and fan service served right with utmost perfection. Thanking Marvel studios and Sony for giving No way home. This is surreal man, still reeling under multiverse spell. Im gonna watch it again and again. One of the greatest theatre experiences ever and instantly became one of my favs ever. Few may think, 9 0r 10 rating is too much but the happiness , nostalgic vibe and the cinematic experience provided by NWH deserves all the praise, high rating and love. I don't know how it gonna hold up the viewing experience in the future, but for now, Im on cloud nine.", "Excuse Me!": "Not as good as the reviews. My wife and I found it boring. It seemed to try too hard to be provocative. Nothing new, bad support characters, poor acting. I'll look for the new BatMan.", "Pathetic spider-man and over rated ?": "Why overrated ?IMDB becoming a sewage for promotions ?This movie is more melo-drama rather then deserves a rating..If and on IMDB does not improves its a death of IMDB in India. Atleast.", "No Way Nostalgia Alone can Save this! Nostalgia A+ Overall B-/C+": "My thoughts in chronological order as I watched it:The beginning is very cheesy. Tons of manufactured tension and corny humor. This is why I'm not a huge fan of Homecoming and Far from Home.Off the rip...WHERE IS EVERYONE? Where is S. H. I. E. L. D.? Spider-Man knows tons of heroes with tons of access to technology and means which can solve this movie's issues rather quickly, but whatever...Ned: C- (his character is just nonsensical)MJ: C+ (their chemistry and relationship is so forced)Why did everyone just believe the reporting when it was leaked that Peter was Spider-Man? How come he just didn't deny it. Where is S. H. I. E. L. D.?Dare Devil cameo: C- (It wasn't really that cool, but ok)THIS IS CRITICAL: The reason for the spell to be cast was super cheesy! Because they didn't get into MIT and now they're all famous, which is making their life hard, sigh. I expect this from a 17yo kid, but Dr. Strange actually does this for him? Sigh...Why does he need money and why is he having trouble getting into college? He's Spider-Man! He knows some of the most powerful, famous, well-connected people on the planet! He shouldn't be lacking money or have trouble getting into ANY college if he wants! Or any place, or institution in general! Sigh... Where is S. H. I. E. L. D.?The reason the spell got messed up is cheesy, he basically wouldn't stop talking and Dr. Strange made a mistake. Sigh...Dr. Strange messed up the spell, really? Really? Sigh...Dr. Strange: Solid B (I love Benedict Cumberbatch, it's not his fault, they watered him down from his usual serious, all business character to a cheesy guy who argues with teenagers. Sigh...)Why does Strange agree to do the spell so easily? Why does Wong agree? Sigh...Why wouldn't Peter know the multiverse is real? He was acting like he didn't live through the snap and then come back and help with everything in Infinity Wars. Sigh...Why does Spider-Man have to go \"find\" all the villains that entered our verse from the spell? Why wouldn't Strange be able to know exactly where every person is that didn't belong?Why does he leave Spider-Man to find them and not help? Where is S. H. I. E. L. D.?He doesn't want to tell Wong because he'll be \"upset\" even though there are verse shattering stakes? Sigh...Where are the Avengers? Fury? Anyone? Where is S. H. I. E. L. D.?Why is only MJ and Ned helping? Why not anyone else? ANYONE! Where is S. H. I. E. L. D.?Why did Jamie Foxx/Electro not look like he did in the original movie? Why is he not nerdy anymore? He got a makeover and a completely different personality? Sigh...How did Aunt May want Peter to help Osborn when Osborn first wandered in? What could he have done? Just zap him and let's go! Why does she want Peter to \"make a difference\" by trying to change the villains fate? Did they not see what tampering with verses does from the Infinity Wars?Why does Aunt May want to be involved so much all of a sudden?Why would Peter want to reverse the villains' deaths? Why does he want to change their fate? What's his motivation? Why does he care? What does he think he can do? Why does he go from respecting and revering Strange to challenging his orders so quickly?Why did he stop Strange from reversing the spell when they initially caught all the villains? What did he really think he could do? Does he think he understood more about the multiverse than Strange? Sigh...How come he could still use his body when Strange pushed his spirit from his physical body? How come Peter just \"knew\" everything about mysticism and the mirror dimension that it took Strange his whole movie to learn?Parker beat Strange???? I think I'm all set...Parker beat Strange while they were IN the mirror dimension???? I'm definitely all set...How does Wong not sense all this is happening?Stark fabricator device that just macguffins out cures like pastries??? Nothing is explained? Sigh...Why did Happy have this sitting around at his apartment like it was a blender or something?What is Jonah Jameson's motivation? He's always around. ALWAYS!How come the Green Goblin can go toe-to-toe with Spider-Man without his gadgets or glider? I mean I know he also has super strength, but with all the stuff Spider-Man has done, seen, and battled in this version of him, GG without his toys just seems low level. Sigh...The Green Goblin spoiling everything and tricking everyone at the condo when they were coming up with the cures feels super manufactured. Sigh...Aunt May's death was an EXCELLENT scene, REALLY good! A+ BUT IT DID NOT NEED TO HAPPEN. Why was she trying so hard to help Peter fight super beings?How come Ned could do the spells?????? Just because he had on Strange's ring? I'm all set... Sigh...The 3 Spider-Men together on screen was simply AMAZING AND MAGNIFICENT: A+++++They're just coming up with cures and stuff on the fly???? They all worked perfectly? Sigh...What's Sandman's motivation? Wouldn't he want to go home to his verse to see his daughter ASAP?What's The Lizard/Doctor Connors' motivation? He's just hanging out enjoying the chaos? Sigh...Doc Ock helping at the end was BEAUTIFUL! A+The way MJ and Ned accidentally brought Strange back from the mirror dimension was never explained and was sudden and stupid.Wouldn't the villains not dying mess with other stuff in their respective dimensions/verses? What happened to ripple effects and such?Strange comes back from the mirror dimension for the final fight scene and has a hard time with Green Goblin? GG gets the drop on him and destroys the box? Why? Why does Strange suck in this movie?Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man saving MJ as a redemption for his own MJ dying was SUPERB! A+So, all this happened because of Peter messing up the spell? Because he didn't get into MIT? Sigh...Strange doesn't seem to have many answers. He's way toned down.MJ is taller than Peter and she's slightly annoying.Where were all the news crews, helicopters, police and EVERYONE during the Statue of Liberty battle? Where is S. H. I. E. L. D.?The final spell feels weird, shouldn't there be more fall out if everyone forgets Peter existed?As a movie, this does nothing to further the Marvel Universe's story or give us hope that Marvel will put out good stuff. This was an awesome trip down Nostalgia lane, but it was not a good movie. It was hollow.Zero storyline. Zero explanations. Manufactured tension. Macguffins galore!This was a treat, but it was not a good movie. Sigh...", "Honest short review.": "I'm not a big superhero fan so the film starts slow, the first hour and a bit drags. All I knew going in was it had something to do with the multiverse and the previous doc ock from the 2000's was in it.It's Heavy on nostalgia so if you are a sucker for superheroes and namely Spider-Man, you might get sucked in. Superhero/Spider-Man fans in the audience were talking that they felt the ending was painful. I'm not sure what they meant, maybe it was a criticism or something emotional, but for me it was just an ending. It's a good movie, not a great one. You may fine the first half slow, but it does pick up.", "Wooowwwww": "This one is the best movie i ever watched. I am Litrelly a fan of spiderman since 05 and tbh what can i say even a Millions of words cant complete my Emotions Towards this movie.", "The Best Movie of 2021 & The MCU": "This is one of the best movies the MCU has made and has brought smiles to all the Spidey Fans all around. This movie was literally made for the fans, the fan service in the movie was unlike any other. No Way Home was the most hyped movie for such a long time and the fact that it still is shocks me! When watching the movie in the theatres, the experience was so wild as the cast of the movie was nothing more than pure brilliance. Tom Holland got his trilogy but including in Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield who have played Spider-Man in the past literally had me standing the whole time! The plot was so simple but it had so much impact on the storyline of the MCU until now and how they were dealing with it made me feel like I was in the movie. My emotions all mixed up with sadness, happiness, excitement, and the film being very believable had exceeded everything I was hoping for. This movie had some of the best visuals ever seen in the MCU and the work put in hiding the cast from the world was a very hard task as it was meant to be a Christmas surprise to the world. As a Spider-Man fan from my childhood this story gave me so much closure as a fan as he was one of the very few superheroes all kids knew back in the day. Bringing back all 3 actors who have played Spider-Man really shocked the world and probably one of the biggest surprise and gift any fan would have gotten. Filled with so much action, romance, comedy at the perfect moments in the movie was mind-blowing and well planned. Experience this movie with friends increases the level of amusement you get as you get to be so grateful that you have shared such a wonderful movie in the theatres with them. A really well made origin story for Tom's Version of Spider-Man and the amount of work and effort he put in as an actor shows in the movie. This applies to Tobey who hasn't played Spider-Man since 2007 and Andrew from 2014. I am very thankful that I was able to experience this during one of the best times of the year surrounded by friends! Thank-You Marvel & Thank-You Spider-Men for making my childhood and dream come true!", "It's back to the beginning of Spiderman.": "I have been a fan of almost all marvel movies but this was just not good. It feels like one of the earliest Spiderman movies and I left the cinema after 90 minutes of nonstop nobrain action that was just a piece of crap storyline. I guess I'm to old for these kind of movies. Marvel usually have great backstorys and I had big expectations when the movie had 9.0 on imdb.So this movie was a big disappointment for me. Don't believe the hype.", "I'm Spider-Man.": "(uproarious applause follows)I've never seen any previous Spider-Man movies besides the immediate prior one, Far From Home (which I adored), and I could tell I'd have loved this movie a lot more if I had, but it was still super enjoyable. All the characters crossing over make for great dynamics even if you don't entirely recognise them. And a pretty stunning plot. Definitely motivates me to watch the others, and then rewatch this!", "Fantastic!!!!": "This is the best marvel movies in oll the time\nI was so excited when I watch this move and personally when my best spider man Tobi Maguire was be in the screen .....!", "Very ordinary movie. Don't understand the hype": "Apart from the union of all three spider men, movie was very ordinary in every aspect. CGI in 3D were looking flimsy. Comedy was just okay. Acting was mediocre except from Benedict Cumberbatch. There was no depth in the script, same old formula was used which was not even convincing.", "Getting Better": "Not a big fan of Spiderman series esp considering they keep changing main character but this was best of all as they combined many characters and plot was engaging. Looking forward to where they taking this series...", "An ultimate superhero film.": "A complete masterclass in superhero movies. Fantastic storyline with a great cast and extraordinary visuals/sfx.The return of previous characters added depth to the story and even made for the villains to have a kind of subplot of their own.All 3 spiderman added their own individual skills to the film instead of just being Spiderman. Maguire especially, bringing a wisdom and emotional attitude as a kind of father figure to Holland as seen in the final scene with Goblin. Garfield saving MJ was a special moment as that was almost a deja vu moment.I cannot think of a single negative for this movie and as always for marvel it sets up the next phase of movies beautifully! Roll on Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness!DC could learn a lot from this.", "Best Spider-Man Film Since Spider-Man 2": "I collected comics for years and Spider-Man was among my favorite characters (Iron Man being my favorite). Sam Raimi still seems to be the one director who knows Spider-Man really well (he also admitted to being a fan and a collector of the comics). He truly nailed Spider-Man's sense of responsibility, his struggles to find any kind of financial stability (in the comics, Peter was pretty much always broke), find something that would actually go his way (rarely did life make things easy on Peter Parker), which is one of the reasons so many readers endeared themselves to a character that was very relatable.Tom Holland's Spider-Man does an excellent job of demonstrating Peter's naivity and acting more like a struggling teen. The stories haven't always been that great, but Holland is an excellent Peter Parker and Spider-Man.The only thing I really miss about the character is his wit and ability to hurl insults at his opponents to drive htem crazy. Garfield probably did the best in this department., but even that was fairly bland.To me, this is the best Spider-Man film of the most recent trilogy. And the best film since Spider-Man 2 (which is still my favorite). At over 2.5 hours, we get a pretty in-depth story with a few surprises that most audience members might not see coming.I also love Holland's spectrum as an actor. He is able to give us genuine emotion and make the audience feel it. I like his chemistry with Zendaya (obvious reasons as to why it's so simple for him!).My only wish is that these latest films would have delved as deeply in the character of Peter Parker as the original trilogy did. That's what made those films (except Spider-Man 3) so special and why they worked so well. It's something that I found to be a bit more shallow with this latest trilogy. Still, this film comes closer than any of its predecessors in that department, which is why i enjoyed it so much.We also got some good, solid veteran actors surrounding Holland (Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe) which is always a big \"plus.\" Jamie Foxx was good as well as Thomas Haden Church.I also laughed at Ned Leeds' quip of, \"what do you think I'm going to do? Turn into a super villain?\" In the comics, Ned Leeds would become a arch-villain of Spider-Man as the Hobgoblin (an off-shoot of the original Green Goblin).If you're a fan if any/all of the previous Spider-Man films, then you are in for a treat! There's enough surprises and story to satisfy just about any kind of fan out there. And while, I have yet to see a Spider-Man that rivals the comics, this film and the aforementioned Spider Man 1 & 2, come the closest.", "Nostalgia overload... and not much more": "Full disclosure I loved seeing Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina back on the big screen.The problem is that it has nothing else going for it.I always thought Tim Holland was great choice and he is doing a good job. Unfortunately the MCU degraded Spider-Man to Iron-Boy.I don't care about any of the supporting cast. I never liked the young Aunt May. Ned (comic relief) and MJ ( too cool for school) are too one dimensional.The plot just exists so we can have this nostalgia festival which is pretty entertaining at times. It just comes of like a fan film with the meme references.", "Again and again marvel fanboy toxic and nonsense": "Logically this movie was far better than the terrible Shang-choi. A good movie? Maybe. A great one? Absolutely no!1st mistake is no one is a real villain, and sinister 6 so forgettable. Green goblin had no purpose and others same.Next, 3 spiderman? Just a moment such a cut clip but nothing else. Same motip like into the spidervirse.This movie such a mess but nothing more, even so it had a alot potential.", "Believe The Hype.": "12/28/2021: To me, it was Into The Spiderverse, the live version. I left the theater feeling something strange that I haven't felt in a while after exiting a movie theater: Joy, excitement, happiness, and satisfaction. No preachy annoying character, no grandstanding speech and no politics. This is my first time seeing Tom Holland as Spider-Man. I grew up on Toby Mcguire's Spider-Man and saw the second Andrew Garfield movie. I wasn't a fan of Garfield as Spider-Man in his film, but I absolutely loved him in this movie. You could see his redemption arc coming, but it still hits you in your heart. This movie strikes a balanced tone and the emotional moments paid off because I cared about every single character. The villains were incredible! Willem Dafoe steals every scene he's in and deserves award consideration. The scene where the Green Goblin stops Tom Holland's Peter Parker's plan to save the villains by erasing their powers was so intense, I think I stopped breathing. Doctor Strange was brutally true that one's fate is their fate and Aunt Mae paid the ultimate price because Spider-Man ignored that fact. Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Holland have great chemistry! Thank you to the screenplay writers and cast for giving the fans an unforgettable Spider-Man experience. All three of the Spider-Man actors sharing scenes was surreal. It was a wild, action-packed, well-acted, well-directed experience with a well-earned bittersweet ending, and the Doctor Strange visual effects were amazing. Watching the villains disappear as Doctor Strange's spell-to-erase-Spiderman-from-memories unfolds and watching Spider-Man say his goodbyes was heartbreaking. What a cinematic experience! Now, I must see every Tom Holland Spider-Man film past and future.", "Hated the ending.": "This Butterfly Effect ending worked when his friends are actually better off not knowing him, but it doesn't work in Spider-man No Way Home. It's dramatic for drama's sake, and it sucks. So they got into MIT, they might have anyway, if they did, as Strange suggested, and plead their cases. And they loved him! They were happy.The best parts were seeing the three Spider-Mans together. (When Garfield saved MJ!)I can see how, if you've never seen Donny Darko, or The Butterfly Effect, and this sacrifice is new to you, that it hits hard, but I've seen it, and I've seen it done better. Also, Into the Spider-verse did the multi-verse better. So, this movie was a big meh for me.", "Fan service movie with little content": "Positives:1. Loved the multiverse concept and bringing back older villians and Tobey and Andrew2. Loved the action scenes involving 3 spideys3. Shorter run time for so much charactersNegatives:1. All the villians were under utilized especially Green Goblin and Doc Ock2. Tom kid Spiderman single handedly beats Green Goblin whom it took a entire movie to beat him by Tobey.3. Aunt May death was really unnecessary4. All the dialogues between Tobey , Andrew and Tom seems forced and mostly from Facebook memes and trolls. Nothing new.5. Not sure how all the villains were alive although they died or cured in the previous spiderman films. More explaination needed6. Last fight scene were totally dark and in 3d it was really dark. Unable to follow the fight choreography.7. Villians will have sudden change of heart at the end. All sinister 5 turns good at end8. There is no good fight scenes like doc ock train scene from Spiderman 2, Green goblin climax fight from Spiderman 1 or Electro fight scene from Amazing spiderman 2.Had a lot of expectations in this movie but it did not even fullfill even half of it.", "Perfectly Balanced Movie": "Perfectly balanced movie with humor, action, romance and adventure. It's hard to understand the multiverse but Dadho mazo ayo. Peter Parker as a character has been on the big screen for two decades and watching Tobey Maguire, childhood favourite spiderman, is such a treat. Tom is such a jolly actor. Sit and enjoy this masterpiece.", "Anyone not giving this a 9 or 10 hasn't seen it": "This movie is easily the best Spider-Man and superhero movie ever made. It just edges endgame and iron man. Honestly yes it does require some previously knowledge but it harkens back perfectly. The acting is 10/10, that stakes/story is 10/10, music 10/10. I'm honestly not sure what more you could ask for. It's perfect.", "Fan service and that's kind of it": "So... have you ever watched Phineas and Ferb the movie: Across the 2nd Dimension? It's the same premise and story just 1h 30min longer and with fan service... I don't get the hype.", "Fairly good, still pretty standard for a superhero flick": "When it comes to superhero movies, I find them to be a bit too formulaic. This movie tries to switch it up with the Spider-Man from different dimensions idea. Sadly, the movie doesn't do enough that is new to stand out from the rest of Marvel's mediocre catalog. The movie is well acted but the story is a lot more convoluted than it needs to be, it contains too many lame attempts at humor which cheapen the emotional moments that they oh so desperately fish for. Why would MJ and Ned not activate Strange's device after Peter fails to help the villains? The whole movie doesn't happen if these two had just made this easy decision. While I like the idea of getting all the classic villains in one movie, at times it feels like too many cooks. If you are getting Willem Dafoe you better give him more the ten lines. A decent superhero movie but not worth watching unless you are big time fan of genre.", "Boring , it sucked basically": "The writers change the scenes ,story as per their own wim , its like watching a live action cartoon . Imagine a kid directing a movie , he wouldn't know the depth of character, the seriousness of a situation basically its like watching logan Paul's suicide forest video , I would have given it zero stars , 5 stars is for fan service and nothing else. Had they released in netflix or any ott platform I would have stopped watching after the first 30 mins.", "Best one": "Shivisaxena best movie.

I do have a couple of critiques, the editing made it feel like they were never all in the same room, that might have been the case but at least make it feel they were. I also didn't like how small scale the whole movie was, with a 200 million dollar budget you can make the final battle a little bit larger and more epic like it deserves to be. Other than that enjoyable movie, fun theatre experience and an exciting segway to the marvel movies coming next.", "Mind-blowing movie": "This is the movie that I have ever watched in my life. This movie was one of the craziest movie of marvel cinematic universe ever. This movie was really really amazing.", "I realize I'm committing a grave offense here with the 6 stars": "I didn't enjoy the movie as much as I anticipated. The CGI was awkward as was the dialog and some of the action. Some of the filler scenes went on way longer than they should have while others were clipped and/or felt forced. As much as I geeked over having just about every legend back from the Spider-Man Multiverse I still felt let down by everything I mentioned above.Something that bothered me while watching is that JK Simmons is playing the same character across the multiverse. How is this even possible? Obviously I forgot this since I've not watched any of the other SM movies in quite a bit of time but it still bothered me. I didn't deduct any stars for that but wanted to mention it because I'm sure I'm not the only one feeling this way.One huge thing that I did like about the movie is that Tom Holland showed us an edgier version of SM than he has in the past and I liked that a lot. He's still very lovable but the shadow of him we were allowed to see was epic.", "Amazing animation": "Amazing animation.The idea of having 3 spidermen in one movie was spectacular.The acting preformance was great.And also the amout of villains in one movie made it very amusing .The death of aunt may was very shocking\nBut give a great taste to the movie.", "THE crossover": "Oh, mama! OH, MAMA!! I'm just gonna say it's beyond what you have dreamed of. First there was The Avengers, then came Infinity War and Endgame and I didn't think any crossover can top them.I was wrong.Just when you think the MCU is past its peak, they come up with something like this.And the previous two live action Spider-Men get closure.", "I screamed out of excitement": "I just loved everything about this movie from start to finish. There was a lot of suspense, twist & turns! Bringing all three Spider-Man together was really a screaming moment for me! I didn't know I would be that happy to see Tobey Maguire. Has Marvel ever disappointed? Not that I recall. Excellent piece of work as always. Thank you to the writers, editors, stunt doubles and all the in between! You keep our minds wandering and take the stress away. Thank you!", "Venom 2 Is way better": "This movie is too long and boring. Tom Holland is the whiniest Spider-Man ever. Seeing him next to his predecessors makes me realize just how good these movies once were and how bad they have become. I wish they would have made an Amazing Spider-Man 3 instead of these Tom Holland Spider-Man movies.It was great seeing the former heroes and villains. That was the only draw for me to see this movie.The story was weak. How can Spider-Man best Dr. Strange when Dr. Strange can easily turn him into a moth? I also hate it when the story can end but a character does something soo dumb that it keeps the dumbness going. First Spider-Man did that a bunch of times then his aunt May does it. At least she won't be in any sequels, I hope.", "Amazing Cinema Experience": "I may be one of the first to review this as I just left a session in Taiwan, the first country to show it. The best spiderman in the MCU version and for me second best spiderman movie after into the spiderverse which I don't think will ever be beaten, but that's animated. Definitely one of the best cinema experiences I've had in a long time.", "This is the best of all the Spider-man movies.": "Don't waste your time watch this movie as soon as possible.

Still the screenplay facilitates giving generic solutions to the problems, the film works very well, it's a gift for Spider-Man fans. Narrative is perfect, the movie execute with successfully connect these points mentioned above with perfection. The fights are good and were inspired by marvel's Spider-man on ps4.The movie did things that seemed impossible to do, it's definitely one of the best movies ever made.", "10/10": "Listen it's one thing that this is easily Tom Holland's best performance as Spider-Man.... but than your Throw in Tobey and Andrew.

This movie.", "Best spider man movie ever made???": "I mean, i liked it no cap. But are we all sure about making this movie the highest rated spider man movie ever?Is being this stupid and make the most dangerous spider man villains free and fight them again is the best spider man adventure ever?", "Do you need to watch the other Spider-Man movies to watch this": "I would say you don't NEED to, however Spider-Man: No Way Home is better if you have watched them. From my experience of going into this movie without watching the original or amazing spider man I would say: First off you wouldn't feel the nostalgia others do, and the characters won't have an explained background. But you would still feel the excitement and emotion of watching this, with only a little bit of confusion.At the end of the day this is an extremely exciting, funny, emotional, and fast-paced movie, with only a few minor problems, that is only a bit better if you've watched the other Spider-Man's. With all this in mind I hope this encourages you to watch Spider-Man: No Way Home along with the rest of the Spider-Man's!", "Spidey ......": "Too much expectations and hype for this movie , is it worth it ?

For the most part, the film successfully manages all these tasks without feeling overstuffed. A love letter to new and old Spidey fans, while also taking Tom Holland's Spider-Man into darker and more dramatic territory.", "Good One.!": "The spiderman i grew up with is Tobey's and its my all time favourite spiderman. With that said this movie has one big component that the makers got right and that is nostalgia.Coming to the Tom Holland trilogy tbh honest the 1st one was just a movie and the second one just okey and compared to them this one is better. Without the inclusion of all the beloved characters including the OG villains this movie would have been just a silly movie. Also would like to mention Disney being the money hungry corporate seeing the success this made is doing the same with Doctor Strange by linking up big names in industry with the movie just as cameos and honestly it works but doesn't make the movie a great one .", "It's great but it's not a 10": "The highly anticipated MCU/Spider-Man movie is everything it needed to be. With great performances and a compelling plot No Way Home is the best Spider-Man movie since Spider-Man 2.First and foremost Tom Holland. Tom was phenomenal easily his best Spider-Man performance. Peter Parker's emotional side was shown and Tom does a phenomenal job of bringing it to life. His chemistry with MJ is wonderful.Villains were all used very well but the performance by Willem Dafoe is the stand out. He was phenomenal, his portrayal of the goblin is menacing and so unbelievably fun to watch.Although Goblin, Electro and Doc Oc were all used well Lizard and Sandman could have had clearer motives so that their decisions made more sense.The only big issue I have with the movie is the setup of the plot. I think it's pretty lazy writing that Dr. Strange didn't explain the spell to Peter considering how dangerous it was. A smaller plot issue is Ned's ability to open portals it doesn't make any sense.The dynamic between the three Spider-Men is phenomenal. Their ability to play off of each other is highly entertaining and funny. The way they were used was perfect and made sense with the plot. The other big cameo of daredevil is great.Spider-Man No Way Home is nothing short of a crowd pleaser. With highly entertaining characters returning to the big screen and a phenomenal performance from Tom Holland Spider-Man No Way Home has become one of the best MCU movies.8/10.", "The greatest Spider-Man movie yet": "The only complaint I have is that we could have seen more of Daredevil and Venom. The rest of the movie is just amazing (no pun intended). And I got everything I hoped for but Deadpool.", "SO.MUCH.FUN.": "Absolutely starved for a fun popcorn movie and this one fed the beast. Funny jokes, and geez even a few heartfelt moments for characters I didn't even like that much in the past. I had such a blast watching this movie, I was never bored, never thought \"This movie is a bit long.\". It kept up a snappy pace with good character development and stellar acting. Really impressed with Tom Holland and Andrew Garfield especially. William Dafoe and Alfred Molina stole the show per usual those guys are so amazing. Loved it!!!", "Spiderman triology in a single movie which rocked the entire Marvel fans and Universe": "Wow they did it again the crew of Spiderman. What a visual treat for Marvel and action fans in this Xmas holiday. No words to match for effort and work of VFX and CG team. Locations and lighting effect was unique. Toby and Andrew Cameo with Tom Holland was visual treat which we witnessed couldn be taken as gift of the decade. All supervillains appearance of Spiderman was pretty awesome. Benedict as usual rocked in a separate way apart from others. Kudos to end credit where Venom and Tom Hardy mentioning about Thanos and union with Spiderman which gave goosebumps and lot of expectations in the upcoming Marvel franchise.

Everybody knows the true identity of Spider-Man and Doctor Strange can help Peter with a spell. Everything change when this spell goes wrong.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an amazing plot, contained plenty of action scenes and much of suspense. Regarding the plot, there were some plot twists that I did not expect so, it was a nice surprise and something that made the movie even more interesting and enjoyable. The direction which was made by Jon Watts was very good and he used wisely both information and characters to create this special movie.", "Spider-Man No Way Home is exactly the movie you hoped for...and then some": "After giving myself a day to gather my thoughts on this movie, especially in comparison to all of the hype and anticipation that came with waiting for it, I have decided it truly hits the mark.Ever since the shocking, dramatic ending of Infinity War which redefined the superhero genre it has lead to an entire internet culture of speculation into each and every detail that comes with trailers, easter eggs and internet news. There are online influencers and internet channels dedicated and devoted into reading between every line and breaking apart trailers to gather a picture of what we may expect to see in their respected movies. With this, it is always difficult to create a body of work which is going to hit a home run for each and every fan and theory.It gives me great pleasure to say though, that No Way Home manages to hit a home run. It perfectly captures a Spider-Man story which is both deeply personal whilst also being an ambitious 'Spider-Man Endgame.' Without spoiling the movie, I can only say that there is enough fan service to give fans of the character everything they desire, whilst also providing an epic story which will have you on the edge of your seat throughout.", "Special Thanks to marvel and Sony pictures \ud83d\udd25": "They did it, it's one of the best film ever made. The emotions that it carries only a true spiderman and marvel fan can feel it. The way it carries from beginning to end is just unspeakable.

If you have watched all the past Spider-man movies, how could you miss this one? I mean, at the beginning I really hated it about the cheesy \"everyone deserves a second chance\" scene and an almost forced non-surprising sacrifice of Aunt May. I was like, yeah, that's spider-man (rolling my eyeballs). But having all the three spider-men (awkward spelling) in the same scene has been one of my best moment of Marvel movies. My tears literally start bursting out when I saw Andrew Garfield catching Zendaya. Who WON'T be moved by this scene! And I was silently sitting there till my tears got all my face masks wet. This is a great relief for all the fans and audiences of Spider-Man. I missed Tobey Maguire and Kristen Dunst. I missed Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. Thank you Tom Holland and Zendaya. That single moment is well worth the ticket.", "I don't get it": "It must be me!I found it to long, it dragged badly for around 30mins, was to \"much like a Xmas film\" goodwill to all killer baddies,\nit woke up when 1 become 3, but before that was very dull, much preferred the 1st 2\nYes the acting was decent, and seeing the old baddies was ok,\nSomeone has posted better then \"Endgame\" are you for real ??Great effects as usual, but what make the 1st two films so good, was lacking in this one.The interplay between the 3 of them worked very well.", "Epic a movie made for the cinema": "After the much delayed Black widow and the frankly disappointing Eternals the marvel juggernaut (assisted by Sony on this one) really needed to knock it out the park and boy did they ever.

I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it, but it really was no way near as good as people have made it out to be.

I was a little bit worried that the two trailers take away to much from the story and that it would be disappointing. But I was so satisfied in the end.First of all: For people who haven't seen ALL of the previous Spider-Man films (meaning the original trilogy + TASM + the two Tom Holland films), this movie doesn't make that much sense. There are two many cross-references which you might not get. If you are a Spider-Man, then this movie is for you. The story is funny, but very emotional in the end. There are so many little details which makes your nerd heart skip a beat. Adding to that, the meme community will also like it. Because there are many memes reeancted and new ones which is so cool.Watch it for yourself. You won't be disappointed.", "Enjoyable but overhyped": "A fun film with a lot of familiar faces from many past films and series'. The story was entertaining, but a lot of the leaks ruined the magic of what it was supposed to be. The fact that Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield and Charlie Cox were indeed in it was a massive deal of the films success, with my favourite cameo of Charlie Cox. Even though it was a heartfelt but entertaining adventure, there wasn't a lot in the story. It was practically in Dr. Stranges' words a 'Scooby Doo' story - with some obvious twists and deaths in the way.Overall it's a Spider-man film with nostalgic characters, if you're a big fan, you're going to see it no doubt. But I expected it to be more than it was with a 9.0 rating on Imdb. Unfortunately, it did turn out to be an overrated Marvel film that just featured fan favourites, and hardly dug too deep into the storyline at all. Don't get me wrong, it's a likeable film with some funny scenes but it's overrated, like most Marvel films. Personally I enjoyed Shang-Chi more - and i'm a massive Marvel fan with tons of comics, so i'm not just some random viewer who shares hate towards Marvel films (though I personally am a bigger DC fan) Maybe it's just me, or maybe spider-man is everyone's favourite character, I just don't think this is a 9.0 at all.", "Wow wow wow!!!": "The best spider man of all time. It was entertaining. Laugh, cry, cheer! The movie was written perfectly. I cannot wait for MCU future for spider man. Kevin Feige is a pure genius. Thank god for him saving Marvel.

You will definitely wanna watch it after it ends.", "There will be Everything You've Dreamt of !!!": "There will be Everything you want!!!There will be Many Callback's, which will be \"Amazing\" to watch.They really nailed Scenes with \"SOME THREE PEOPLE\"The only lack Lustre was that,\nThere was not A Thrill and Hype in Story,\nEverything was predictable.Or to say \"SONY REVELED to much in Trailer.But you'll not be Disappointed.", "Confusing and weak storyline": "I was very disappointed by this movie. The storyline was far too weak and at the same time too confusing. It also felt like some of the scenes went from one to the other quite quickly.", "What Spider-Man fans were waiting for!": "If you've been watching Spider-Man since the first movie came out then you're gonna love this. The story links the past with the present while providing non stop action you would expect from a marvel movie.I hope they don't ruin this and keep taking this franchise to new heights.", "Yay entertainment is back": "The story line was unique and surprising. What a refreshing movie with pure entertainment. It has been a long time since we have seen something different without the same story line. Everyone I know really likes this movie.", "A lovely nerdgasm all over the floor": "I waited for a few days to write this just to be sure it wasn't nostalgia clouding my thoughts on this, because I love all the villains from the Raimi trilogy, and Lizard and Electro are...you know, there also, and as much as people (me included) dunk on the Amazing Spider-Man films, I have had my fun with both of them over the years, either when I was a stupid kid who didn't know any better (my school had a reviews competition thing in 2014 and I found the review I submitted of Amazing Spider-Man 2...I gave it an 8/10. What the hell was I smoking as a 13 year old), or as a stupid adult who can at least laugh at how bad that film is.And although there are a hell of a lot of member berries all over this film, there genuinely is a narrative reason for it and I don't think they could have told quite the same story without doing that. And anyway, as far as I know, the concept of a multiverse in Spider-Man is far from a new thing, and are you really going to complain about seeing more of Alfred Molina as Doc Ock or Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin? Cause I'm certainly not.Especially not when all the villains feel like they've stepped right out of the sets of their respective other films without having aged a day. Except Electro, which is good because he sucked and they made him better. There are some slightly odd changes made to them, like Electro's design is completely different, Sandman never appears as human, he's just constantly a man-shaped pile of sand, and I couldn't help but think they did something to Lizard's face (haven't seen his film in years though, don't just take my word for that).But once you get past that, it really does do justice to all of them, and even though they all have their lines that do feel more like they're coming from an MCU writer than something they would have actually said, it's just so much goddamn fun seeing them all together.And it does all the returning characters really well, too, especially Peter, who gets by far my favourite arc of this trilogy, and Tom Holland absolutely killed it as ever. In fact, everyone did, and for anyone who complains that Spider-Man 3 or TASM 2 was bad because they had \"too many villains\", well this ought to shut them up. It has almost double the amount of villains and is still really well put together. The problem with those other films is they had too many studios messing around with the story, not too many villains.And by the end of the film, I really felt like something with serious consequences had happened, and like from here, it really could go in any direction imaginable.And yeah, the directing is a little bit bland (although I'd consider it a step up from Homecoming and Far From Home nonetheless), and there is the odd cringey joke like in all of these films, and sometimes it does get a little too far up its own ass with all the callbacks, and I can certainly imagine this being the kind of story that has a boatload of plot holes I haven't really thought about yet, but despite all that, it's easily one of my favourite MCU films to date.And I'm at least 95% sure it had nothing to do with the nostalgia, because I saw this with my girlfriend who has never seen a Spider-Man film before and doesn't really care much for superheroes at all, and she liked it even more than I did. So if you're not going to trust me, someone who amuses himself by quoting Green Goblin lines on a weekly basis, trust her, who needed an explanation of who everyone was when they appeared and still loved it.Or trust the audience I saw it with, because holy crap I've never heard an audience so noticeably loving what they're watching as I did with this.", "Spoiler man": "I don't know how to say it , spider man no way home is truly mind blowing movie. I am a big fan of tobey maguires spider man . And i like andrew garfield too. My favorite spider man\nwas tobey and favourite peter parker was tom. Andrew is not bad .

Do yourself a huge favor and avoid spoilers at all cost. For this movie it is worth it. I am so reluctant to make any vague references to the emotional body blows delivered because they make the movie.

It hits all areas you've always wanted in a Spider-Man film and the future of Spider-Man and the MCU is exciting.", "Great movie, but relies on surprises": "Honestly love the movie and how it ties in so many characters perfectly into one universe and especially how it's set up the next stages for the MCU. However watching it again I did not get the same feeling as the first watch. I knew exactly when things were going to happen, when every turn would happen, when every surprise would come. And I can no longer rate it as highly as I didn't get the same enjoyment. All in all a good movie but not perfect like previously described by people.", "A Multiversal Phenomenon": "Amazing film another great marvel movie, just watch you'll be entertained throughout.1 missed opportunity for the sinister 6 making it a 9/10 not a 10/10.", "Dumb fun": "This movie is hard to review without light spoilers. Basically its a super fun popcorn movie and I really want to give it a 10 just for the fan service being so fun for me as a comic collector and Spiderman historian. I give it an 8 even though I find it to be very stupid and poorly acted and The Spiderman character is a jerk in it.Basically this movie takes elements of One More Day from the comics, which is when I stopped collecting Spiderman and pretty much comics in general shortly after. This was almost univeraslly hated, Spiderman makes a deal with Mephisto the cartoony demon from hell to make MJ forget their love in exchange for Aunt Mays life. They do something similar here but make it worse.Basically everything bad that happens is Spidermans fault and he continuously makes things worse. Due to Spiderman being such a jerk, people unnecessarily die or are traumatized for what in the end amounts to a very pointless and selfish venture for Peter to make his feelsies feel better. Plus I'm sick of British people trying to pass as New Yorkers or Americans in general in film all the time. We can hear the difference just like when Americans try to act British. Can we just get Tobey back? I still don't care for Tomei as May either. I should dislike Zendaya being cast appropriately as MJ, but somehow she's great casting for the character and shines in all these, but everybody else is meh OK.Ultimately though this is soooo much fun as a Spiderman fan to just watch and turn your brain off for. Great movie I highly recommend to anybody even vaguely familiar with Spiderman, but also I don't like this version of Spiderman as a character AT ALL after this movie. Luckily theres other versions of Spiderman.", "A perfect ending to a new beginning": "Spider-Man No Way Home is the definition of giving the fans what they want. Tom, Zendaya and Jacob's performances carried the film and provided audiences with both humorous and heart-wrenching moments that will stick with fans long after watching the film.", "Fun watch but ... lacked emotion.": "To me, Spider-Man: No Way Home felt like Marvel tried to \"over-do\" things. It's a grand idea no doubt, but I think trying to stuff too much into a single movie didn't work out as intended. Aunt May's role felt overly moralistic, and her death failed to arouse any emotions, at least in me.Alfred Molina's character got the redemption it deserved. Enjoyed his and Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin alike. It was good to see the other two Spidermen too but honestly didn't it feel like it was really NOT their universe? Garfield's Spiderman saving MJ? I mean I get it but again, the scene didn't connect.I think I will leave Dr. Strange out of it cause after all, its just a comic book movie, and there would be no movie without his mistake(s), right? Loved the music/soundtrack wholeheartedly.", "Sets MCU spider-man to be at it's best": "This movie was great itself. The feeling of Nostalgia every second. I hated MCU spider-man for so long. Cause he didn't feel like the iconic spider-man to me. But after this movie, I feel like it's a great way to set the MCU spider-man to be like a good version of Spider-man. I loved this movie. I gave it a 9/10 cause we didn't get to see sandman and lizard do that much. And I always thought Andrew Garfield needed a 2nd chance. Andrew's performance was AMAZING in this movie. Tobey was great too. And Tom got some upgrade which was needed. Overall, I loved this movie very much.", "Full of surprises!": "This is my first review for any movie. I am located in Asia and I have the chance to watch this movie today.Spiderman no way home contain all the elements, fun, happiness and sadness.If you are a Marvel Fan like me, there is no way not to watch. It will give you all the memories and the epic feeling.If I have chance, I will probably go back to watch it one more time.", "Weak in some points, good to great in most": "Ok, some criticisms first cause this is a pretty great movie and I wanna get this out of the way:-I think this trilogy did a little bit of a disservice to Peter Parker. Something feels off about it, and I think it may be that Peter is thrown too far too fast into the wider Marvel world, and he goes through so much without too much of that shown in how it affects his story in darker elements. Tom's delivery remains immature throughout. This only worked decently in Homecoming imo.-Electro's powers seem to waver a bit depending on when it needs to. Doc Ock not getting shocked when he tried to take the arc reactor? Bit odd imo.-Peter's relationship with MJ is still not quite convincing. They don't do much together and don't seem to have anything in common.-leaving off the Mysterio bit was odd.-the Spidermen bonding scenes felt a little too hamey on the cameo aspect, and less so on natural character interactions-felt like the ending with the amnesia and Aunt May bits coulda been done a little bit more sentimentally or more of a setup.-making Dr. Strange stuck holding magic thing yet again was annoying and felt too simple. If he was at least more physically and dynamically fighting off the inter dimensional invaders in the background, I think it would make this scene a lot betterOther than those kinda iffy parts that do undercut some of the story, this was great.The beginning conflict with MIT is fantastic. Loved the moment where their friendship is reinforced, and it made a great lead up to the multiverse villainsAnd boy, are they good.From the moment they arrive, you feel like the peace of the situation is balancing on a knife. The villains' motivations all are very tangible, and their menace even more so. Doc Ock and Green Goblin in particular (especially Green Golbin).Let's talk about him for a second. Right off the bat, even though I've never seen his movie, he's very compelling and pitiable. Just a lost old miserable man, who opens up seeing a fantastic science student. When he turns, his performance is astounding. William sells demented egotist like no one else can.The trust bonding with the villains was fantastic. Loved the tension, and loved the emotions at play with these villains relying on this boy to help them. And how they broke was very convincing.And boy does Tom Holland know how to sell death scenes.The scene where Marvel Spidey grows off of the mistakes of the other spider men, and cries with his friends was a beautiful gut punch, and really sets up the finale. Kinda wish they spent longer on the Amazing Spider-Man's effected psyche and actions after Gwen's death thoThe final fight did pretty well. Most of the resolutions were ok to villain arcs, Doc Ock's and Green Goblin's being the best, and Amazing Spider-Man being able to save Gwen was quite good, and the amnesia sacrifice was touching. Hopefully we get to see Green Goblin a little more, his final scene was torturousAlso, the humor was great throughout. The dialogue was extremely well executed.", "Do not expect too much!": "PROS: There are hardly any, still-\n1. All three spideys were shown in action together.2. multiple villians fought.CONS:\n1.

But bad visuals": "The story of Peter Parker who is in conflict with his own self being split into two. Spider-Man got mature thats good. This process has some kind of emotions to it but so bland in visuals. Some good but brief action scenes. MCU rather MCM goes ahead. Showing Dr strange so weak is a shame, have some respect, or maybe he lost most of his powers because of him not being sorcerer supreme anymore, we will know soon.", "Perfect ending for all spidermen": "The movie was the perfect wrap for all of the characters good or bad except the main star.The best bit of the movie and the most powerful out of all 8 spider movies was the feeling of redemption when Andrew Garfields Spider man saved MJ.It was his emotional response it was perfect!.It is q shame they didn't show a flashback of Emma Stone falling as thatbwould give the scene more depth to newcomers.", "Thank you!": "This really did feel like a giant and generous present of love and kindness for everyone that loves Marvel movies - and especially fans of Spider-Man.

This review will be quite short as no words can describe how good the film was.The movie has every aspect a great superhero movie should have. Amazing action scense with superb CGI.

Toms Peter shows he is still immature and careless from the start where he messes up the spell causing the whole thing to the end where he tries to kill green goblin despite aunt Mays words and probably still would if not for Tobey stopping him and green goblin disappearing. This story also completely nerfs dr. Strange and doesn't even try to understand how the ring dr. Strange and the other sorcerers use as Ned somehow is thinking of Tom and somehow summons the other two spidermen even though he has never met, seen or heard of these people despite the fact you need to think of the place you want to go to use that ring.

Seriously, the whole cinema was clapping, cheering, crying together as one. This has awoken the child in me and I cried numerous times myself - I rarely cry at films. Was this fan service? Absolutely. But it was done perfectly.This film is a masterpiece, it'll go down as the greatest marvel film of all time and I doubt it can be surpassed. The actors were perfect, their performances were phenomenal. I wasn't a great fan of Homecoming or Far from home, but Tom Holland was exceptional in this as was everyone else.Go and see it, you won't be disappointed.

White male characters are not reduced to idiotic memes, there is no Mary Sue berating the males, no politics, no religion, no preaching or woke messages at all!!!Simply a great story told well that actually brings the audience together, can you imagine that in this day and age of divisiveness.If this is the direction Hollywood now head, they may just miss the iceberg.", "Big Fun!": "Spider-Man: No Way Home attempts to go (very!) big, and it does not disappoint. There are multiple layers to unravel as we go on a rollercoaster ride through worlds and emotions. There are the usual laughs along the way, but also some daringly dark moments as well that finally give the \"Tom Holland Spider-Man\" another emotional dimension. This is the first time when I believe he actually becomes Spider-Man, and is no longer Spider-Boy.It's fun to see the revival of so many characters (this is not a spoiler if you seen any of the trailers) and the production design & visual effects are amazing (of course). Strong marks for music and editing round out an overall above-average performance by the crew.This is a big movie with a big budget and big goals, but it is also thoughtful in its execution which makes it more than just a blockbuster success. It feels like a personal journey that we as the viewer get to go on with the protagonist, which is what cinema is all about.", "Ok best movie in the universe": "It was mind blowing to see all three Spider-Man and all there villains that new all there identities\nI was amazed with daredevil and the post credit seen when the symbiot was left behindFor sure worth every penny in theaters and in your home!!!\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude2e\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udd78\ud83d\udd78\ud83d\udd78\ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udd77", "What a clever direction to build the multiverse": "Dinged a star because I felt there were some assumptions the viewer is expected to make that aren't all that obvious and could easily have been made clear by better dialogue. But the way marvel unveiled their multiverse in this film was spectacular. I also loved that all 3 spidermen were put on an equal level, apart from lines here and there meant for humor. Such a great film, such a nice way to tie everything from the Spider-Man saga's past together into the Marvel world, such an exciting time to be a Spider-Man fan.

What I don't like is that I'll probably never see a better Spider-Man movie ever.", "spider mans collage": "It felt like a collage of all Spiderman films and it is purely for Marvel fans as the entire plot is based upon that and for other non-marvel fans, this would be like a meagre one as they won't understand the real impact of the goals the other Spiderman from other universe has got to achieve in this one, for example, the 2nd one saving the new spider man's GF, the 1st one resisting the 3rd one from killing, as they both faced regrets only by doing this and now they've saved 3rd one from these acts & hence their regrets would not exist, also the healing of the villains won't be much understandable for the ones who never knew what trouble that has caused them & others. And there were some characters like the lawyer who felt totally new even for people like me who've watched almost all Spiderman films.The upgrade of spider man suits & the usage of nanotech was interesting to watch but remember that Shankar has shown this to the mass audience in the best way in 2.0 itself back in 2018 itself, I don't think anyone has beaten that yet.Overall, it was a good watch and definitely a treat for the marvel fans.", "No Way Home was just a really fun and enjoyable celebration of the character": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is directed by Jon Watts, and is easily one of my most anticipated movies of the year. The secrecy, speculation and uncertainty, made going into this film a truly exciting experience. However I made sure to keep my expectations at a reasonable height, as I personally haven't been the biggest fan of the last two instalments. Walking out of this film I felt very satisfied. This is easily my favourite performance from Tom Holland in this role. I didn't expect the movie to be as mature as it was. He didn't do that annoying fast talking whiney voice, and he actually had substantial growth in the movie. It was seriously about time... The return of past villains was great to see. I loved seeing Alfred Molina and Willem Defoe in scenes together. It was incredible to see them play these characters again, and they did such a fantastic job. It honestly made my year seeing Willem Dafoe kill it as the Green Goblin again. Personally, this was the first film in the series that actually felt like a Spider-Man movie. The villain's motives weren't centred around Iron Man, and Peter Parker finally had to deal with some serious hardship. We see Peter use his intelligence to solve problems in order to protect his loved ones and that finally made me start to care about his character. As for negatives, yeah the movie has a few. I've always felt Jon Watts has never done anything unique on a visual level in these movies. They always look as though they fit comfortably within the basic MCU aesthetic. I also felt the movie was begging for an energetic score, and Giacchino's music really fell short for me. The writing is another issue I had. This made characters like Norman Osborn (and others), feel strangely off, due to some of their lines of dialogue. The movie has pacing issue, as well as an inconsistent tone at times. Also new abilities that were randomly introduced for a character in the film and it made me scratch my head. So looking at this film amongst all the other Spider-Man movies we've gotten over the years, this probably won't rank within my top 3, just purely based on the level of writing/filmmaking, which still doesn't compare to the Raimi films, and Into the Spider-Verse in my opinion. However for me, No Way Home was just a really fun and enjoyable celebration of the character, which is pretty much what I had hoped for.", "The Best Spider-Man Movie Ever Made!!!": "I LOVE IT this so Much of MCU Movie (After Eternals Became Most Controversial MCU Movie), Tobey Maguire and Andre Garfield is 100% Back Confirmed (No Cap), The Multiverse is Epic, And End This Duration, They Getting a Teaser Trailer of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness!!!Rating: 10/10.", "Brilliant!": "The best Spider Man movie since Spider Man 2 with Tobey and one of the best comic book movies I've seen in a while.

My kids were excited so we decided let's see it in the movies.Now I'm not saying it's bad, but it's a movie that totally tries to play of nostalgia. Peter Parker trying to save them what a terrible storyline. The movie is extremely boring until the other 2 Spider-Mans appeared. Then the movie finally picked up for the last 40 mins, and it was neat.I believe people are just in love with the nostalgia of the movie. Then the end was exciting so people forgot about HOW boring the first 1:45 of the movie.

A performer of a single type casting--a clumsy, boring, unengaging nerd with savior complex. Just look at his roles, they are freaking the same! Holland is the biggest mistery of the whole Marvel franchise for me. How could a person with such an arid charisma become one of the main characters? Besides, when talk about the movie, Peter's experience and reliability are hugely disproportional to his recklessness and self-confidence, which is very annoying, because the whole story of Spider-Man (which is a cool theme park as the rest of Marvel movies) turns into a very childish fantasy, which in turn forces me to skip Spider-Man movies despite other characters of the Marvel Universe appear there as well. Asking to ditch Holland in favor of a more interesting actor is way too late, unfortunately, and this is really sad. I don't hate Holland--I just think his lack of talant made impossible to make Spider-Man another interesting part of Marvel Universe.", "THE BEST ONE...YET!!!": "This is my number one favorite Spider man movie, yet. I don't want to give away any spoilers, but after having seen it, I've been on a high ever since. I seriously want to buy another movie ticket and view it again. I'm the type of person that would avoid spoilers and not watch movie trailers (bcos watching trailers is kinda like a spoiler to me, hope ya'll get that haha). So I went in blind, not having seen the trailer to this movie. I had seen a few photo's here and there so I knew who was going to appear and so on... Even then, whilst watching the movie, they had managed to not inform us of everyone that was going to appear, and I loved that!!If you are a massive MCU fan and have watched every movie and TV show they've released and you have had a joyful cry afterwards, this is going to knock your socks off.If you are just looking for a great action movie to watch in the cinemas, after going through lockdown and the variants, so ya'll just wanna have a good time, this move is for you...If you are a MASSIVE SpiderMan fan, and have seen the Tobey Maguire ones and the Andrew Garfield ones this one is going to take y'all on a rollercoaster of emotions. I'm a fan, and this rollercoaster went from clapping and cheering, to tearing and sobbing, to aweing and gasping, just the perfect combo for this kind of movie. I guarantee, after viewing this, it will be on your top 3 SpiderMan movies list. SpiderMan No Way Home, officially changed the game!", "A must-watch": "Wow. Just. Wow. I'm blown away by how good this is. It is hands down the best out of the three Spiderman movies starring Tom Holland, like it makes the previous two movies seem like child's play. Brilliant plot, outstanding performance by the cast, amazing soundtrack, a really great balance of humour and nuanced emotion, leaving viewers feeling poignant at the end of the film. The build-up of the movie from start to finish was very good, and there was not a moment that was wasted. Honestly, I heard that there is going to be another trilogy starring Tom Holland but I don't know how they'll be able to top this one.", "great visual effects": "As the other marvel movies, this one also had a great visual effect.Since all three Spidey was in this movie, I must say that Tom Holland is still my favorite.The downside of this movie were some lines felt quite cringe-worthy and forced. Especially the conversation between the three Spidey and either any of them with MJ or Ned. But overall, this movie was very good.", "Its ok only": "I guess the biggest issue is that the story just gets a bit old.Its certainly well acted and produced, but it just does not add anything new. Same formula as always with some subtle changes.That not only goes for the story but also the production.Its entertaining, but definitely overrated. If you want to see a great superhero movie with a new approach , go and see the new Batman.", "Exceptional piece of art": "Absolute perfect balance between acting, storytelling and fan service. Everything that happens in this movie it's perfectly timed, the characters from another movies have an important role in this movie and they aren't just fan service and the acting is amazing (especially from Tom Holland... I would mention other performances but it would be a massive spoiler).", "Wow.": "This was an experience. Mark my words, it will be a LOOOOOOOOOONNG time before we see another movie this good be released. That being said, you will have to watch Spider-Man 1, 2, and 3, The Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2, Spider-Man Homecoming, and Spider-Man Far From Home to fully appreciate this movie's grandeur. But trust me, It's worth it.", "Too much in one movie.": "The review \"helpful to not helpful\" ration will be trashed hard here i know it.But they this movie was not good. Spidey fans will web me for this but this movie was flat. Its was boring. The Zendaya part in this movie was boring, his dumb friend with dumb haircut was boring, all was boring.Thing is this could have been a 2 part thing like Infinity war why didnt they do that?, there is too much going on for one single movie.MaGuire and Andrew part was ok, but we could have had more on them, instead no its just meh.I'll keep it short no spoilers 3/10.", "Spider-Man: No Way Home, my first review": "How long has Spider-Man: No Way Home been buzzing around social media for? Take a moment to appreciate how much of an impact the build-up for this epic finale to Tom Holland's Spider-Man trilogy had on not only the die hard MCU fans, but also the audience who were brought out of the woodworks to reinstate just how much of an impact the classic Spider-Man comics had on their lives. There was certainly no new news to what we expected from this film, in that almost every fan theory was precisely calculated, as well as knowing how we were going to expect a thrill ride of an adventure, and No Way Home is definitely no stranger to forcing you to eye the screen with your full concentration for the entirety of the runtime.A film directed by Jon Watts, Spider-Man: No Way Home focuses on the ramifications of the leaked identity of Peter Parker (Tom Holland) after successfully defeating Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal), directly following on from the events of Spider-Man: Far From Home. The movie opens up with the immediate reactions of the general public and consequences slowly begin to follow up, such as Peter, MJ (Zendaya) and Ned (Jacob Batalon) failing to be accepted admission into M. I. T, directly delving deeper into the controversy surrounding the perceived identity of Peter Parker, advertised none other than J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons). Peter is now a criminal.After experiencing his persona being tarnished, Peter approaches Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and requests that a spell be cast on the entire world to ensure that everyone forgets who Peter Parker is, which expectedly with all of Peter's requests to tamper with the spell backfires. Quickly moving on from Peter's problems and slowly into what the audience was wanting from the film, we see familiar faces such as Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) and Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), previously from the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films. It is now in Peter's favor to undo the entrances of all these characters coming from alternate universes with the help of his friends MJ and Ned.The links with the previous Spider-Man films was certainly the most compelling and intricate idea to bring together a multitude of characters, a personal highlight for me was to see Willem Dafoe reprise the iconic role of Norman Osbourne, and reliving the insanity and his incredible skill as an actor, as well as dropping the iconic line of \"you know, I'm something of a scientist myself\" to draw laughs from the audience taking inspiration from the iconic internet meme it became. It's with utmost confidence that the majority of the MCU's superhero movies are fairly predictable in how they execute their stories to the audience, however No Way Home trusts that although a lot of the film has been predetermined, it uses the iconic phrase of \"with great power comes great responsibility\" and the connection with the previous franchises adds significant depth to the film.The massive beat to this film are the returns of both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker from other dimensions. What impressed me about how they were brought into this film was that it wasn't an immediate 'wow' moment. This is because the audience wasn't already on the edge of a seat during an intense action sequence when they were revealed. Instead, Watts decided to bring them into the movie slowly with some humor attached to it.The climax of the film is fairly fluid and slick in terms of action and while it was not the final battle we expected in terms of excitement, there was still an emotional aspect to be considered after witnessing the death of Aunt May (Marisa Tomei) so the film didn't have any place to get us out of our seats too quickly, but just to enjoy the ride while it lasted. It doesn't succumb to anything too over the top such as the final battle in Avengers: Endgame.Expanding a bit on the influence of marketing a film to your audience before it's release, the question to be asked was how surprised were you when you finally saw Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield finally appear on screen? These so-called fan theories of other Spider-Man's appearing in a scene as well as leaked photos of all three Spider-Man's in a picture together added too much credibility to this being the 'big reveal' in the film. It's certainly a difficult process to be able to hide all these secrets however one important thing to note when it comes to viewing anything for the first time is that social media 'hype' can actually have a much more everlasting and detrimental effect on your overall perceptions and thoughts about a film once you have seen it for yourself and with all of this in mind. And Spider-Man: No Way Home was definitely one of those films that fell right into that trap.At the end of the film, my overall feelings were that from what I had witnessed during the events leading towards this film I would have expected a much more satisfying feeling leaving that cinema, because all the press and promotion that took place before the final release of the film along with all the fan-theories had created so many holes to fill. Now, that's nothing to say this is a negative review of some sort as this film went above and beyond to articulate some of the most revolutionary feats anyone has seen in an MCU film or any film in general. However, one thing for certain is that the build-up of a film is a massive factor and plays a huge part in how we see Spider-Man: No Way Home as a film overall.. That's the main problem with a film that becomes far too popular amidst fans, that as it is so highly anticipated within the industry it becomes too much of an expectation theory, in that what you expect to see on the screen tends to be far over the limit to what you actually get.Spider-Man: No Way Home could be argued as 'cinematic history' bringing together generations of characters lasting since 2002, and the cast and crew did an amazing job to reunite such a humongous community of fans to enjoy probably one of the most impressive feats the MCU have ever pulled off. My only wish was that there wasn't as much social media buzz about this film, as I reckon it could have been a better experience overall had all these fan theories and leaks gone out the window. But this film, it had a unique concept, and that's what counts.", "The best in the sequel but...": "First of all I can't fully discuss this movie without spoilers but I will try my best to not spoil it.This Spiderman movie might be the best Spiderman movie out there with the original being second, this movie is a true fan made one meaning this what Spiderman fans wanted and waited for for a long time, the movie caught my attention from the beginning till the end knowing that Spidermans true identity is now known worldwide (good build up from the previous movie) loved the adventure he took and how he dealt with the problem was amazing, loved the relationship between Peter and MJ and Ned but the chats between Peter and MJ was little too long and boring but overall loved the build up of the friendship.Loved the safe, fun and slow start at the beginning and then the build up for an emotional and adventurous story. I liked the acting of Tom Holland in this movie more then the previous ones but sadly Zendaya needs some comedic acting lessons overall the cast and acting was good.Loved the dramatic spice in this movie not 100% comedic and loved Peter's expression of emotions finally it really showed us how a superhero feels beside being the hero of the day.This movie gave Spiderman fans something to keep thinking about for the rest of their lives and definitely marked it self in the superhero movie industry as one of the most entertaining.Now lets just stand up and give the director Jon Watts and the writers and the vfx studio and everyone that made this move be possible a round of a applause\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f.(My first ever review hope you liked it)", "Shocked and in awe!!!": "32 years old, never ever have I've been this nervous and exited for a movie to come out.All I can say after watching it is that you have to experience it for yourself.", "Best one yet": "I love these films but this one was the best one yet! Great comedy bringing ensemble and of course your Saint Benedict Cumberbatch who has class to every film. Spider-Man versus Spider-Man of my youth and I'm 55 now good comedy excellent acting. I love how the filmmakers managed to make us think this is the first time we've ever seen the Spider-Man or this as SJ etc absolutely loved the comebacks of to comebacks of Characters.", "Excellent - Go see it!": "I'll keep my review of the movie brief and fairly spoiler free! It's wonderful. Characters, effects, emotional and funny scenes, classic MCU. If you're worried about whether Andrew or Tobey will be in it and how the film will treat them, don't be concerned on either front (they don't do anything daft like kill them off). Are there plot holes? Yeah a few. The ending is going to take some wrapping my head around, but I'm not going to let it detract from enjoying the film and looking forward to what is coming up next!Ok... Time to review the reviewers.Peter as a character is fine, he's not been \"woke-ified\", \"woke'd\" or whatever the term is. I don't know where where that has come from but it's so sad that people can't drop their political/sociological ideologies for 3hrs to just enjoy a film.A few people (not many) have said they walked out. Anyone saying that definitely went in with the mindset that unless it went exactly to their liking that they were going to walk out and make a show of it, then come on here and write about how they walked out. Well done, if you walked out you missed a kick-ass 90 mins and got nothing in return.Effects. The CGI is totally fine, there's no janky CGI moments. I honestly don't know what else to say about this, maybe the people complaining about it walked into the wrong film?Plot, or rather plot holes. Ok, I'll meet people halfway on this. Personally it didn't stop my enjoyment of it but there's a couple of \"but why didn't they just...\" and \"but surely there's still...\" moments. The ending is going to take a little unpacking. At worst though it's a little confusing but it'll come good, I have enough faith in the MCU at this stage to take a few things on faith.", "Overblown nostalgia from Marvel/Sony?": "I have not been a fan of the recent crop of Spider-Man movies. Actually I kinda hate them. I don't enjoy Tom Holland's take on the iconic character, the recasting of main characters to bring more diversity, and the hyperactive teenage-angsty scripts. It just doesn't work for me.I loved Tobey Maguire's take (even S3's Venom/Sandman can be forgiven) and feel that Andrew Garfield was let down badly in his all-too-brief time in the costume. I'd much rather see either of them in the current MCU than Tom and this film gives us a chance to imagine such a scenario.To see Tobey and Andrew cross over from their respective Universes was so powerful and heart-warming for me. I miss the soul and vulnerability they brought to the role as opposed to Tom's constant astonishment/enthusiasm which drives me nuts.The film is poor. Without Tobey/Andrew, I'd be giving this a 3 out of 10. It's a boring film and it didn't pass the bum-on-seat test for me. It was a risky move stuffing the film with so many villains and Dr Strange and for all it's visual spectacle it left me hollow and not immediately wanting to see it again. It was eye candy at best for me. There was some obvious green-screen on show - perhaps using old footage, or cramming filming in, or even to maintain some level of secrecy with the actors? And the footage of Thomas Haden-Church was an obvious lift from S3 so apart from doing a voiceover I don't think he stepped one foot on set.Maybe those younger than me who weren't old enough to enjoy the original entries will disagree and that's OK.I've enjoyed Tom's cameos much more than his solo efforts. Maybe it is time for Tom to hang up the costume?", "This movie was AWESOME!!!!!": "I love every bit of it. The whole movie is a love letter to all the previous spiderman movies. I've seen most of them but it makes me want to go back and rewatch them. We get Tom Holland, Toby McQuire, and Andrew Garfield in the same movie. As usual the action is incredible and the cgi is top notch. The synosis is Peter Parker's identity was reavealed to the world by Mysterio on J Jonnah Jameson's news website. He hates Spiderman's guts. He is basically Alex Jones. ( For more inforamtion on Mystero watch Spiderman Far From Home) Now Peter Parker doesn't get a momnet of Peace. His Girlfriend M. J. and his besty friend Ned all wanted to go to the same college. They were sent rejection slips because they knew Spiderman. Peter goes to Dr. Strange and asks him to do a spell to make everyon forget Peter Parker is Spiderman. The spell was done incorrectly and people who knew Peter Parker Spiderman in other universes were brought into Tom Holand's universe. The orignal plan was to just send the Villains who knew Spiderman back to the other universes where their spiderman is supposed to kill them. Aunt May says that they should try to reform the villians before sending them back to their own universes. Some people complain that Tom Holand Spiderman doesn't talk about Uncle Ben enough. Aunt May dies in this movie so that will finally shut up people who think that.", "Softly well-made, again, for kids and teens": "Quite entertaining with very good acting, too much cheesiness and comic moments, dismal logic, 90% great VFX and CGI, lacking darkness (bad), minimalistic show of blood (bad), eye-candy forgettable fights & battles, a heart-warming cheesy ending and acrobatics in the snow as the glassy top of the cake (the latter bad).Though it was a little better than the two previous installments, I still expected more of it and its screenplay. Unfortunately, it's made for the age group 10 to 17 y.o.

It had my full attention from start to finish especially in the 2nd half. Dr. Stephen Strange role in this film opens up opportunities for more interesting, creative storytelling. The multiverse aspect of the story was very well written. I love how Marvel Studios pays tribute to the earlier spiderman movies by featuring Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield and the villains in them with a new spin. Chemistry among the characters were engaging. Dialogues were funny and witty. Benedict Cumberbatch's performance excellent as always! So much interesting spin in this one.

Is good :)\nsome scene is cheap but still worth to watch.", "A Fitting End To The \"Home\" Trilogy": "A phenomenal tribute to the live-action character of Spider-Man. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a movie that pushes Tom Holland's Peter Parker to his limits while also teaching him the most iconic lesson: with great power, there must also come great responsibility. Pros: The touching moments between Peter, MJ, and Ned depict the growth and firmness of their friendships on and off-screen. The inclusion of past Spider-Man franchises' characters brings a nice ending to their stories (or maybe not for certain characters) while also helping progress Tom Holland's Peter Parker. The fanservice in the movie is used well and should not discredit the movie in any means. The emotional scenes throughout the movie help highlight the weight on Spider-Man's shoulders and how his decisions have consequences. By the end of the movie, the audience realizes that Tom Holland's Peter Parker trilogy is his origin story, with Peter Parker becoming the true embodiment of Spider-Man: a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Cons: The CGI/visual effects are sometimes spotty. In theatres, the CGI at times was noticeably bad. HOWEVER, as I mentioned earlier, the emotional scenes in the movies are a big highlight to Peter's journey and the way the scenes are shot adds to the emotion. The obvious detail that was spent on these shots is very noticeable and different compared to other less visually appealing and lacking scenes. Watching at home, Marvel's DVD/streaming release of No Way Home has had finishing touches done, and the mistakes from the theatre release have been fixed. Summary: No Way Home is a perfect resolution to the \"Home Trilogy\", and Marvel fans should be excited for what is to come for the character.", "great crossover": "Not exactly the most creative spider-man film, but a solid movie riding the popular film theme of the multiverse. Definitely the best Tom Holland spider-man movie and for fans of this film franchise the crossover of the other two \"spider-men\" is a concept you'll have to appreciate.", "The Best Spiderman Film ever": "Honestly, the previous two Spiderman MCU films relied heavily on the interrelation of the other MCU films. However, this ultimate film is very independent in terms of story complexity and character development. Many surprises were given and greatly satisfied the fans.", "well, ..": "It's a good movie, there is no arguing that. But is it that good? I myself don't think so. The movie does not, in my opinion, offer any thrills or drama beyond those of its predecessors in the series. The simultaneous introduction of all the heroes (spiders!) and villains from the previous installments, while definitely interesting, did take away some of the charm of each one of them, as focus and attention were divided and none was really the focus of the movie. I also don't like the fact that Spiderman of the current world, and his friends, are all teenagers, and I speculate here that that might have shifted the interest to vote to the related age group of viewers, which seems as such to be also the most taken with this latest presentation of the verse. Dr. Strange contributed significantly to the movie, and introducing him into the spider verse spiced the atmosphere in a nice way. The title of the movie suggests some sort of problem going back home, but that's not the case in the movie, not in that default sense. Previous characters get pulled from their home verse and into the current world, but there was no issue sending them back home in the sense of hardship or inability, and it was rather answering the question of whether they should or shouldn't be sent back that stirred a dispute between Spiderman and dr. Strange and things then evolved.I'm not trying in anyway to be harsh on this movie, nor do I think it's not good. All I'm saying is that to me it didn't quite feel on 8+ rating level..!", "Surprises": "Booked the day off to see this today as did NOT want to be spoiled ha, and it was totally worth it.If anyone is curious, and hasn't seen it yet - yep Toby and Andrew are back. Their 'revelation' was actually really cute, and not what I'd expected before going in (still wasn't convinced they were 100% in it - but I did think it might happen when Holland fails to catch MJ, one of the others sweeps in and gets her. Spoiler - they're in way before that). One really nice surprise was the amount of Toby/Andrew we had. It's made me miss them. Their banter was cute af and it was nice to see emotion from their own films being brought into this movie.One criticism I have, or an unfulfilled wish I suppose - is that I wish we'd have had more insight into their current lives, beyond what we'd seen. We get a hint from Toby that him and MJ are still together but I wanted more ha.I think as I was watching it I realised it's literally only the audience that this is exciting for; the characters have absolutely no reference to each other so there's a lack of 'surprise' if you like - between each of the SpiderMan/any other character. This could've potentially been resolved by having supporting characters like MJ for Toby or maybe Aunt May for Andrew. Maybe not them, but some way for the characters to interact in a way that wasn't as complete strangers. The villains don't give much of that.Another thing that wasn't my fav, was the villain story. It wasn't terrible AT ALL, but I just didn't get why Tom was so adamant to save them from dying; when he knew they were villains. I know he doesn't want to kill, but it seemed weak to assume he'd be that invested when he obviously just needed to get them back home. And it also was a bit confusing after all the excitement of T&A's return, what the 3 SpiderMen had agreed to do. I sort of had to guess as it was happening.The ending was brilliant, in my opinion. There was real emotion with Zendaya and Tom - and it opens up the next movies with some real questions. It could even close the Tom era, if that was the way they decided to go/Holland didn't want to return.I don't think anyone will be let down by this movie, even though our expectations have been built up to be absolutely enormous. It delivers. Maybe not as you expect but that's probably good as well as less so.Enjoy!", "Finally, a Spider-man MCU film which feels like...a Spider-man film.": "The last entry of the Homecoming saga is a perfect culmination not just for Holland's Spiderman but also for the entire franchise. It also deliveres an emotional send off to previous characters from former films. I was expecting that this movie was gonna be a 2hrs 30min fan-services but instead i was blown away with the fact that this movie is more than just that. Although this movie is not without flaws, i am super excited for the next trilogy which i have a feeling that the next trilogy will be closer to the spiderman we all know from the comic book.", "Jam Packed, but not Bloated": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is not just a movie, it is a celebration of the most beloved superhero in cinematic history. I laughed, I cried and I cheered with the rest of the theater more times than I can count.The movie was jam packed but it did not feel bloated. Rather than try to force-feed multiple storylines and characters, which happened in Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man 2, this film delicately balanced each character and carefully articulated each moment. The pacing was offbeat at times, but that could have been due to my hopeful anticipation for the third act.Some might call the film fan service but I call it a modern cinematic spectacle and a moment I will remember forever.", "Disappointment": "This movie is just like a TV special episode that reunites former cast members. It is just fanservice. The plot is just Peter is known to be Spiderman by everyone - Goes to Doctor Strange for help - Messed up because of Peter - Ended with Peter just letting Dr. Strange do what's supposed to be done when he came to him for help without interfering. And just pure fanservice in between. I commend the acting of all casts though especially Tom Holland and Willem Dafoe. It's just that the story is so not well written.", "Not your average superhero movie.": "And if you like time travel films and alternate dimension stuff you'll probably love it like I did. Just go in blind and be sure to watch the other spider man movies to get...caught up. They did a stellar job here. Its not the usual cookie cutter stuff either.", "An instant comic book classic": "This is a loveletter to all comic book fans out there.

There wasn't even 10minutes we were without cheering. I had to close my ear, like my eardrum will blast and blood will flow out, yet still cheering every few minutes now and then. Theatre became Stadium since first second. Crazy ! Total madness ! I noticed each cheer almost last 10-20sec long. Total madness. I don't think human kind will ever again achieve this kind of film.", "Very dark & emotional.": "In fact, 'too dark & emotional' could be better. That's why I gave only 8.

It's hilarious, action packed, heartfelt, and a truly great time at the movies. 10 out of 10.", "Absolutely amazing": "This is one of the best movies from recent years. Even the nostalgic factor is working very well due to the fact that all the characters from previous movies are written extremely relatable and likable. I think this is a must watch and one of the best movies from the MCU.", "More like an adventure movie, with Spiderman and the gang in it": "No complaints about the movie itself, as long as it stands in its own cathegory. Out of the MCU, the Spiderman movies are the less fit for extrapolations, therefore the less Sci Fi of them, once you count out Spidey origins story. No major relevance for the \"Sci\" part of the Sci Fi paradigm, unlike the other MCU productions (even the so low rated Eternals, which turns out to be a speculative approach to the whole Annunaki and Ancient Aliens theories).So it was entertaining, adventurous and somehow forgettable. Also, a bit puzzling in the end, where something is amiss, but no spoilers here, you'll have to pay attention for yourselves, when watching it.Yet, bigger ratings would pull down other MCU movies, therefore just a 6 will do.", "New Standard": "Spider-Man No Way Home set a new standard for future SYFY movies. Just wow!Looking forward for more movies like this one. Marvel just outdone themselves with Spider-Man No Way Home.", "Such a disappointment": "The high expectations from this movie bring him to be idiotic and very childish.The storyline doesn't add up, Also the acting is terrible (except Tom Holland and Dafoe)\nthis is what happened when productions company decided to invested tons of money with commercials and buzzing at the movie.", "Best Movie Ever?": "Best Spider Man movie? \u2705\nBest Movie of the year? \u2705\nBest Marvel movie ever? \u2705\nWithout giving away any spoilers...Spider Man no way home is an amazing movie. I have been excited to watch it since the teaser trailer was released. Marvel have made the plot a mixture of emotional, exciting and the perfect length. The movie gave me nostalgia with the familiar faces along the way and the amazing acting from all of the cast. The atmosphere inside the cinema was also great, with the audience cheering at the big moments in the film. All of my mates have seen it in the opening days and straight away booked their tickets to watch it again. Oscar shout anyone? I would highly recommend anyone watch this film.", "Thank you Marvel!": "N terms of the best entertainment I've had watching any film this year, this would win hands down. My interest in the Marvel phenomena has definitely dwindled post-Endgame and while I have enjoyed some of the Disney+ shows, the hype for this needed to deliver.The entertainment levels are consistent throughout and it makes the experience even more engaging as the film goes on. The action sequences, the chemistry, the humour all add to the experience.The fan service is what this film is about, but it's narrative (involving the multiverse) makes complete sense for the trajectory of the franchise , it wasn't just thrown in for nostalgic purposes. And there was an interesting climax that adds further questions to an already complex narrative. Watch this space.Marvel delivered on a lot of levels here, it was just a great watch from start to finish. No doubt my favourite Spider-Man there's been for a long while, and just Marvel film since Endgame.Highly recommended. Enjoy.", "so good": "So good.

No shock value, everything was expected.The action scenes didn't seem long enough, including the final one which was very stop start as everyone kept stopping to have a chat.Ending was strange too. I think I'd only put Spider-Man 3 below this out of them allCan't just be me who feels this way, I'm sure the 6 or 7 people who walked out of the theatre with 20mins or so to go agreed me, but the current average rating on here is baffling.", "BEST MOVIE EVER WELL 2ND TO AVENGERS ENDGAME!": "Tobey talking about Harry was heartrenching same with Andrew Catching MJ.BEST MOVIE EVER WELL 2ND TO AVENGERS ENDGAME!And sandman was great but wish he could've used his human form, but obviously spoilers.", "Amazing.": "The best superhero film.

The audience applauded, perfect ending , perfect story, unexpected twists, just an amazing film.", "An absolute Masterpiece with very few flaws": "Without giving away too much, I have to say that this is easily in my top 3 marvel movies of all time and is the best Spider-Man film ever made (yes, including Spiderverse and the original Spider-Man 2). The performances in this movie are truly captivating and the pacing in the first hour is incredible. This film gives us a much darker take on Tom Holland's friendly neighborhood Spider-Man and it does not disappoint. The villains, the drama, the stakes, create a spectacular experience that will live on for generations. Jon Watts has truly outdone himself with Spider-Man: No Way Home.", "mcu at its best": "This was the best movie experience of my life. If doctor strange has a spell where i could see this movie for the first time again, please let me know. Also, doc ock and green goblin had no buisness looking that fine. I finally understand why white people clap at movies.", "Extremely complete, story wise and action wise": "This movie was a true masterpiece for me. The best since the Maguire trilogy. The action and special effects that come with it are unbelievably well made, and it had this sense of nostalgia seeing all the former characters coming back. Some of those characters could have a bit more depth, but it is hard to be deep on every character in only one movie. I am thrilled to see what they plan next. We suppose a connection with Venom.", "Everything I expected and more": "The best live action Spiderman of all time, I'm still hesitant on if it's better than Into The Spider Verse or not, I'll have to rewatch it, but this was just wow!", "You'd need to be a VERY big Spidey fan to call this great": "It's ok - full of jokes and lighthearted moments. One for the kids for sure. But really, that ranking of 8.7 is nuts. It isn't the weakest in franchise - but the dialogue is average at best. A typical movie from the Marvel superhero-comedy universe.I still rate him the best of the modern spidermen.", "Emotionally Mature": "My rating: 8 outta 10Emotionally mature, grown up & witty; easily the best Spider-Man, even making up for lame villains from terrible previous Spiderman franchises (Sandman) by treating them (and the audience) with dignity and respect, not just talking down to fan-boys. Closure and also starting of new things, and to me more interesting than the Avengers assembled, the best part it has going for it.", "Everyone, I mean EVERYONE is here!": "They gave us long time Spidey fans what we finally wanted, the rumors are true!

And I had no idea I wanted it untill I was in tears in cinema. My generation just needed that and I am sure they all will agree with me.", "Probably the best Marvel film made": "As a whole the MCU saga has been top draw, yes some have been a little flakey but still fun to watch which is where ive always been with all Spiderman films never disliked them just really didn't get into them, The MCU versions have been ok and I've usually waited until rent or release to watch them until no way home! Heard great things and haven't been to the cinema in forever due to proxy pandemic! Well this was a real treat it's an epic story start to finish! Plenty of laughs and Easter eggs if your into spotting those and honestly don't have a.bad word to say about it!", "Overrated and meaningless movie!": "Marvel characters deserve better stories and direction. After the end game, all the Marvel movies are BOGUS!We have higher expectations from the Marvel team and if they are short of stories then it is a humble request to the team, kindly take your time and then create a new movie because it is impacting our pockets and our valuable time.We all know what you all are capable of and we will be happy to wait for a fantastic movie from the Marvel team.I am sorry for this review but trust me you deserve this.Thank you!", "This film will definitely go down in history...": "...for being one of the most memorable of all times. It's certainly not the best film ever, since there are way too many unnecesary jokes and the plot isn't really that interesting (maybe if I were much more of a Zendaya and Ned fan, I would have enjoyed the ending more, but i'm not).However, it does have a significant emotional value. Seeing three spider-man right next to each other on their signature pose has got to be the most epic frame in the entire MCU.Every conversation maintained by Holland, Garfield and Maguire is a reference to their films or just pure fan-service, but that was what everyone wanted to see, so i loved those dialogues.To be honest, there weren't many thrilling action scenes and the trailers revealed too much of them.It would have been better if Garfield and Maguire made their entrance during a fighting scene, even though I settle with the fact that they were in the movie.", "Honestly, watched it TWICE": "So, I know a lot of people simply love it because of the actors brought into the film, BUT if you were to take that aspect away, it's still a great movie.Tom Holland and Zendaya's chemistry is very well displayed throughout the movie, really connecting Peter and MJ without overdoing it.Personally, I expected to see Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. But it still surprised me and made me genuinely happy. Along with the fact that Ned is the one to \"bring them in\" makes it all the better and more meaningful.The relationship between Peter and Steven blossomed into a strong bond for the film, emphasizing the responsibility Strange feels as though he has for the young Avenger.One thing I am not a complete fan of was how fast paced they brought in the multiversal villians. Though I do know that was sort of the point, the abruptness could have been handled a tad bit differently.Many viewers seem to diagree with the idea that Tom Holland's Spider-Man would actually consider sending them home before destroying them or defeating them but it's in fact EXACTLY what he would do. He's aware that they don't belong there and deserve another chance in their universes.Overall, the film is very well executed and in the end wrapped up the trilogy nicely, while also leaving more for us to look forward to!", "Spiderman:NWH": "What a movie!An almost perfect plot, which includes Peter Parker not only having to face various villains from our childhood but also everyday problems, making him that way identifiable for the watcher. The best point of the movie is however undoubtedly the unity of the 3 Spidermen. Portrayed perfectly by Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire, they offer the watcher the opportunity to relive his childhood.", "The way of becoming real Spider-Man": "It wasn't cinematic except for the last part at the donut's place. I would say it was one of the best scenes in MCU history. However, I found some parts are opportunistic such as the death of aunt May which looked just for The Phrase. The way of shooting looked TV series.However, every opportunistic parts and bad parts worked well in a festival called 'MCU Festival' such as 'Avengers', 'Avengers Endgame' and this film. Those parts aren't allowed to do in normal films but MCU. In that way, MCU is hard to compare to the other films because it made completely different original culture.Spider-Man is always lonely except for Jon Watts version. The 'Home' series was about 'Spider-Boy' and this film was about a boy becoming a man. Peter Has to be alone to be a hero in 'Spider-Man' somehow. And those opportunistic parts were important as initiation.I was exited when the other characters from Sam Raimi version and Marc Webb version came out.As I wrote in the beginning, the last part was so sad but the best. The kissing scene is a legend as Tobey Spider-Man's. After everything has done, Peter went to see his girlfriend and the best friend.Even nobody knows him, he's still a 'friendly neighbourhood'.", "What it should be, it was.": "Created an account just to review this, so straight to the point.

Great fights, true to the character, great script utilizing so many different components to make a cohesive, excellent whole. Great conflicts in play, with real true stakes. Less silly child jokes and things; he finally grows up. Even knowing the twists I still absolutely adored it again for the second time.It has more powerful moments in it than the rest put together - but it's built off of a foundation of what's been attempted before. And it has a greater sense of what \"is right\" and what Justice means. Like I said: it finally grew up. I wonder what's next for spidey after this?

They would go nuts and their brain would take time to process what's just happened, & what's about to happen in The Marvel Cinematic Multiverse.In my mind and heart, Sony's &\nMARVEL STUDIOS' SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME is ranked best at No.1 position among previous Spider-Man movies & I easily consider that it has one of the best storylines among entire MARVEL based movies.", "A must watch movie for Spider-Man fans": "This is what I call a masterpiece, the perfect blend of action, suspense , thrill and emotion.

I did not expect anything better from NO WAY HOME. Even the presence of the villains from earlier iterations of Spider-Man wasn't enough to give me any hope. It just seemed like the usual nostalgia pandering Hollywood dishes out to entice people to otherwise mediocre movies.I was proved wrong. NO WAY HOME is a lot of fun-- honestly, the first time I have been satisfied with an MCU title in a while. The interactions between all of the different Spider-Men and villains was entertaining, and I liked how the conflict was solved by trying to bring out the humanity of the villains rather than through pulverizing them.

No, but a fun time.", "What a great reminder of our childhood": "I've just finished the movie...\nAnd all I'm Feeling right now is a mixed up off all of the feelings you may know\nIt was a great scene where Peters meet up and TEAM UP!What a beautiful movie and what a great experience That A person can have.The Future is bright and we all are look in to it.To Infinity And Beyond!\ud83d\udd77", "couldn't be better": "This movie single handedly picked phase 4 from a 3/10 to a 9/10 best spiderman movie ever and one of the best movies ever.

It's too childish, dialogs to stupid and almost not watchable. I get annoyed by this Spider man.", "A truly amazing movie, the best Spider Man yet": "\"Spider Man No Way Home\" is an epic, big, and just a relentlessly entertaining movie that exceeds all expectations.Let me start of with the MANY great things. Tom Holland is fantastic in this movie. He gives easily the best performance out of his three movies. Zendaya is also amazing. She gives a very funny performance and her chemistry with Tom Holland is just on-point. The action scenes are just a spectacle to look out. They're fast, quick, and well choreographed. Benedict Cumberbatch is also very good in this movie. The comedy is also great. Most Marvel movies for me at least I don't find hilarious, but this one was pretty funny. And this movie also has some gut-wrenching scenes. This movie almost made me cry. It's a very emotional movie at times. The Villains in the movie too are just great. All of them gave great performances, and they all had their time to shine. Mainly Willem Dafoe, who was actually intimidating in this movie. The action feels very serious, a lot more serious than \"Homecoming\" and \"Far From Home\". And finally the ending. The ending was just great. It's very emotional, and the choice they make was very bold, and very amazing.I have really no negatives with this movie. Maybe the only one I can think of is that sometimes the effects for Sandman and lizard aren't the best. They aren't bad but the movies previous to this were a little better.Overall......This movie was amazing. The acting was great, it was very entertaining, emotional, visual stunning, and just really made a huge impact, and It's easily the best Spider Man movie in the MCU, and maybe the best of all time.", "Fun": "The hype is a little too extreme for this one. There was no real threat since Doc Strange can go \"poof\" and fix everything (with a catch) and the other enemies could be neutralized with the tech good guy juice. I only found Willem as the Goblin to be compelling as the rest were often belittled and parodied when they were not uneasy or upset about being in a different universe. I need more danger to really be reeled in and some false sense of safety to keep me on edge but overall it was a very straightforward action superhero movie with the smart and commanding gf and the comic relief buddy with some shock value moments that we all expected but were still surprising.I think the positives speak for themselves, it was fun.", "GodSpeed": "If you're a fan of the previous Spider-Man trilogies you will love this film. The honour, the fan-service, everything you've always wanted. One of the greatest superhero films ever made.", "Solid movie with fan service done right": "This movie delivers in many aspects, particularly the action, visuals, score and acting. It is a well grounded story that deals with morality wonderfully in a compelling way. And of course, the fan service is great, accomplished in a satisfying way that is well integrated into the plot. I had so much fun watching it.", "Watched three times, still can't make up my mind": "The movie is obviously good, otherwise I wouldn't have rewatched it twice. I guess the part I'm having trouble with is deciding how good it is.On one hand there are the visuals and matching cinematography that make you wonder if this should be considered a masterpiece. Additionally, there is dynamic, over the top entertaining spidey action the likes of which audiences haven't seen since Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2.On the other hand, there are a few classic marvel comedy injunctions that miss their mark, even though this technically still is the funniest marvel movie after Thor Ragnarok. Additionally, there are a few glaring plot holes conceived in both the dialogue and the actual unfolding of the plot. These problems make me hesitant to pull the trigger on calling this title a masterpiece.However I remember rating infinity war and into the spiderverse as 9/10 titles as well, before I realized I likely wouldn't see the quality presented in those movies within the next few years. After enough viewings I subsequently changed their ratings to 10's, and I'm wondering if that'll happen with this movie as well. If anything, this movie is the most I've been on the fence between a 9 and a 10 because it definitively joins the list of all time superhero epics such as TDK, Logan, and Infinity War in terms of quality and writing. Maybe with enough viewings I'll decide this movie is a masterpiece after all, because I can't imagine seeing anything similar anytime soon.", "A MUSTWATCH for spiderman fans": "This movie is amazing. Any spiderman comic fan or just about anyone would LOVE this movie. The emotion the laughs the everything is as perfect as it can be.", "Lived up to its hype. Best Spider-Man movie !!!!!": "The expectations were high and demanding. They vastly surpassed them in my opinion. I was so shocked and flashed. I had the best time in years while watching it. For every Spider-Man fan and specially those supes like me growing up with Spider-Man this is a movie you can't afford to miss.MultiverseFrom several interviews I understand now the worries about the plot before they went into production, but hats off they managed to pull off an amazing blockbuster on a high new level. It's unique in its own way. I've never ever believed I'd rate an action blockbuster full of ups and downs 10/10. It never felt for a second overloaded or too much. They set the tone great and the character Peter Parker develops and learns the hard way and have to deal with the consequences.Tom HollandI don't want to single out any character besides Tom Holland's. You should experience it by yourself. He deserves all the love and credits in the world for living the role he grew up with and playing it with passion.He's an incredible actor and he has become one of my favorites in years.ConclusionThey merged three different eras of Spider-Man movies in a great way I wouldn't have dreamed of. Finally they managed to do things right. Spider-Man 3 & The Amazing Spider-Man couldn't do what No Way Home did. Building up a final movie of a trilogy without forcing and demanding too much from the story. I felt so free & happy after watching it. It could've run more than 2 1/2 hours like for 2 more hours I just couldn't get enough off it.Spider-Man No Way Home is a true masterpiece and the best marvel movie ever made. 10/10.", "best spiderman movie out there!!": "Best marvel movie too!! It was a literal masterpiece and should be watched in theaters as soon as possible,(SPOILER ALERT)tobey and andrew's were genuinely one of the best scene in the movie.the landing of the spiderman in their own style at the end of the movie was epic.", "Spidey fun combination": "Leads straight in from far from home. Spidermans identity has just been exposed to the world. He goes to Dr Strange to fix the problem, this causes a split in universes causing old Baddies to appear from the two groups of movies before this trilogy. In all 7 movies with this being the 8th, of course very complicated for a normal movie watcher, I think they do a good job filling it in, but what do I know having watched all the previous movies multiple times. To make this more complicated this movie is also part of the MCU which is where Dr Strange comes from. To be honest I'm losing it on the plot threads at this point.Anyway this movie is a lot of laughs for a Spiderman fan. Taking the best villains from Spiderman 1&2 and adding an extra plot arc for both of them. Great writing and acting even if a lot of cheese from the previous movies are poked at. All to help Tom Hollands Peter Parker to complete his arc.Lot of fun to end a complex saga and probably Sonys bow out of the MCU.", "EVERYTHING": "I'm well aware it wasn't a perfect film before someone comes for me. Perfect films are hard to come by. And i'm not a comic to movie person i've read some but i don't know all the specifics so i'm sure it wasn't perfect for ppl who love the comics. But either way it was a really good movie. The past two spider-man movies have been good but when you really look back at them they weren't anything top tear. Also marvels spider-man has had a much different feel then that of tobey and garfield's. Either way i like tom holland and his spider-man ingeneral. But this movie just really tied everything together. It betrayed marvel's peter parker and spider-man in a much different sense/way then the past two films and i liked this version a lot better. There seemed to be a bit more attention to deal among other things. And the film itself was really good the acting, cgi, cinematography, cometic timing all of it. It just all came together. I was enjoying it the entire time i was watching the film. And i felt very complete and happy after i finished it and honestly haven't stopped thinking abt it since i watched it. I highly highly recommend it!", "Really?8.6?": "Alright, first I gotta admit that once again we give too many praises to a movie that wasn't qualified to get them.I'm no Spider-Man hater or marvel hater, in fact it is the first version of the Spider-Man movie that brought me into the world of superheroes, also growing up watching the 1992 animated series. So, yeah, no hater but a huge fan and a crazy lover. Even when everyone was talking s**t about the Amazing Spider-Man,I'm the one of some to defend its reputation (pretty young and some dumb shit to do). Even, to be totally honest, when everyone thought the relationship between Pete and Tony was freaking weird,I found that s**t interesting.But when they gave me this and expected me to write a bluff piece about how awesome it is, I had second thoughts. Was this movie that awesome? Was this movie good? Was this movie even OK? Suddenly I don't know the answer to each question. After a while when the digital version of it came out, I paid 20 DOLLARS for it with no hesitation.And I just wanna strangle myself the minute I finished rewatching it.Don't get me wrong , it can't be that bad. It surely has several highlights that deserve to be praised and remembered. The return of Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Doc Octopus and Tobey and Andrew as Spider-Men was nothing short of a miracle. Being able to see them again after all these years of separation, we, to see those familiar faces from our early days (my childhood to be exact)again, all witnessed the history and I couldn't feel more honored.And that was it, the one and the only exciting point. Now let's get down to some parts which I think was not enough and definitely not impress me.First, it's been six movies since we saw the Tom Holland's Spider-Man and god he hasn't grow at all, literally at all. Since Ben is missing, so we automatically put Tony into the spot of Peter's father-like and mentor-like role. After Tony died, we all expected him to take a look at himself of the responsibility he should've taken and what a true hero means to him and his life and his family and his beloved ones, but he didn't. Alright he's young, he needs time no worries. After his first real fight with Mysterio without Tony being around him, he was supposed to take the responsibility as a hero but not a kid. We didn't see it, fine he's just a kid ok we get it. But after Mysterio revealed his identity, what popped right into his head? Let Strange cast a spell so everyone could just forget about it. I mean,what kinda hero is he if he didn't stand up to face this drought and just wanna run away from it.Secondly, I understand that the filmmakers want to give him a push to grow up so they literally kill aunt May by using Peter's own hands. I get it alright, I get it. But why in the hell he wanted to save those so-called villains? They've destroyed thousands of innocent families, all those innocent ones. The minute Spider-Man decided to save them, to give them a second chance. Who's gonna give the innocent ones a second chance? Absolutely nobody. Spider-Man didn't get the privilege to forgive them, to save them. And more ridiculously, he didn't even aware of that, not even a slightest second of his goddamn life. Thus, it is the most confusing part of the whole movie.I'm just an ordinary audience like everyone else. In fact, I do wanna analyze the lens language of it but it simply doesn't have anything to analyze.So, an ordinary movie that's been over praising. That's it,period.", "Fantastic film.": "You always worry where the MCU will go next. How can it improve on some really great movies. But then this film comes along and Marvel still continues to blow your mind. Honestly superb and I really cannot fault it. Well done to all involved.", "SOMETHING WAS MISSING FOR THE ENTIRE FILM": "Why do almost all super hero endings these days finish in a night finale? Oh waiT, CGI, its easier for them to work on that, this movie needed a better ending with a way more amazing combat or help between the three spider mans, I was expecting way more.", "Saved by the nostalgia factor": "This movie was not a masterpiece, but it was solidly entertaining and the biggest reason for its entertainment factor was the nostalgia and surprise cameos of other Marvel heroes.I loved all the villains of the other Spiderman franchises, and I loved seeing the Tobey-Spiderman (he got old!) and Andrew-Spiderman interact with our resident baby-Spider, Tom Holland. Surprise cameos from Matt Murdock of the Daredevil MCU Netflix series and Eddie Brock from Sony's Venom were also appreciated.That being said, this movie is unevenly balanced to say the least. Most emotional scenes were on point (e.g. Aunt May's scene was very impactful to me), but some fell flat. A lot of good action scenes that had me on the edge of my seat, but also some yawn-inducing blurry messes of CGI. Some of the humor was funny, but some of the lines also felt awkward.The weakest part of the movie was probably the plot. Basically the entire movie consisted of \"who caught the idiot ball now?\" because a lot of characters were acting dumb and irresponsible. Peter was the main culprit in this (but I can forgive him, since he's still just a kid) and the second worst offender was Dr Strange. Don't think too hard about the plot, just turn your brain off or pretend that all the characters have had one too many glasses of alcohol and that's why they have poor decision making skills, because if you analyse the movie too thoroughly, you'll take out the joy and it won't remain entertaining.Enjoyable movie for those who are fans of all the spidermen franchises. Sometimes nostalgia is all you'll need to keep entertained.", "Perfect movie": "No way home an example of how it should be\ndesigned fanservice for fans. All villains\nperfectly matched, stupid mask removed\nGoblin and he acquired a more spectacular look.The story of Aunt May and Uncle Ben is done right, and\nhere you really feel the death. Spoils\nDo the doctor all his raspberries\nuber abilities? No, because we do not know them\nlimits, and we have to take his word forLet the cross reanimate people better.Strictly watch, if you have time in the cinema.The film is wonderful.", "Best movie ever-": "Ok, so this movie is astonishing with all the visuals and it was really appealing. Having Andrew and Tobey in it too made everyone's day. I hope that this will not be the last on that they all star in for Spider-Man. I really think that Dafoe and Tom deserves Oscars for this. Great movie and amazing director.", "WYLION - With great power comes great responsibility": "Consequences. No rush. Marvel finally took some time to make a good film. A great film. This was something special and caters for the fans and the casual watchers. Well done Marvel Studios.", "The Humanity": "The 2021 Spider-Man becomes revealed to everyone so he, Mr. Peter Parker, and his family and friends face fame problem. On the other hand, Spider-Man only faces accusing problems as well. So he goes to Dr. Strange to seek help. Dr. Strange has a spell that may erase the memories about the real identity of the Spider-Man from the people of the world. So Peter Parker may not relate to the Spider-Man. Peter Parker agrees and requests to proceed with the spell. While Mr. Strange spells his magic, Peter Parker requests to exclude his girlfriend from the magic. Then he again requests to exclude his best friend and then again his Aunt May. Thus the spell of Mr. Strange was interrupted which results a bug in his spell. The Super-Villains of the past Spider-Man series' come back to the 2021 world. The 2021 Spider-Man wants to get back their humanity to the Super-Villains so that they lost their powers and be normal people. But Dr. Strange denies it. Thus, the 2021 Spider-Man clashes with Dr. Strange which leads to some unexpected events and the movie story deals only with it.Since this movie got a great number of viewers and got great ratings so, this movie may define logically. That's why the question 'logical and illogical' comes.One of the silliest stories in a superhero movie. The director knocks on the door of the writer and he gives a deadline to the writer to write a story which brings all the supervillains of the Spider-Man series and all the Spider-Men in his next spider-man sequel. So the writer does it. He make his desired story and put it in this movie. What a silly idea!What an interesting wrong spell of Dr. Strange. He was trying to scratch some of the memories of the people of the world, but it reforms the Spider-Man's super-villains only, nothing matters with the memory errors. I mean, his wrong spell may spoil the people's memories about spider-man, not re-welcoming the super-villains only. What a coincidence! This type of coincidence only happens in Bollywood.Ned's spell doesn't bring the last, the most recent, and the most relevant spider-man but the older ones.The older spider-men come to the world of 2021 but they both were not very surprised by entering through the fire circles. They become familiar with Ned and MJ very quickly.The older spider-men recall their tragedies and become emotional. If they come from their present universe, so how do the villains come from the past universe?All three spider-man has their aunt Maries, uncles Bens, MJs. What logic! I'm recalling these characters because this movie has shown us that the previous spider-man movies aren't the same. They are different. If they are different so why their character names are same?The 2021 Spider-Man tries to show his human characteristic to the viewers he even clashes with one of his co-super-heroes, one of his fellow friends (as they both are the staff of the Marvel cinematic universe). So how does he becomes great if he clashes with another superhero who holds the same responsibility to the human as he does?I never knew that Spider-Man is also a scientist. He can invent chemicals that destroy the villainous powers of the villains. Which they used at the last moment of the movie in a syringe pushing into the necks of the villains.I have seen the villains wait until the conversation ends in some scenes. One villain with one spider-man. (When the 2021 Spider-Man fights with the Green Goblin, the other two spider-men were enjoying the fight.)I don't know why the Statue of Liberty had a renovation in this movie. As if, it would be helpful to ride it and to fight with the villains for Spider-Men. Like this, the writer adds his desired modification in many logic to fit his script.The all spider-men vs the all spider-men villains. Nothing new here. (Except the 2021 Spider-Man villains.) I was expecting a new one though. So when I found it not, I was frustrated.If Doctor Strange has the power to bring back the dead villains, why 2021 Spider-Man didn't request him to bring back his dead aunt? Or undo her death incident?Maybe I didn't understand this movie. Maybe this movie has a broad story and message which flew away over my head.Overall, for entertainment reasons it is okay but in fact, this movie is very overrated. Rating 6 means fair, 7 means good, 8 means great. This movie is rated 8+ which means it is great. But it is not. In terms of rating, it is fair. But I hated it. The whole movie doesn't make any sense. The story is very silly. This superhero movie doesn't deal with those supervillains who are a threat to humanity. Rather, it deals with the over-acting of the newest Spider-Man who invites the clash between him and the villains denying his fellow Doctor Strange. Those villains had already faced their consequences, so how does he want to reform them? Very tried to glorify this Spider-Man more than the previous ones. What a silliness! Illogicness has its limit! Just I need all spider-men and all his villains in one movie, I need to make a script of my imagination and the people will watch it clapping wow wow.", "Sloppy teen drama with tasteless CGI": "I don't mind teen drama. But the writing has to at least match that of Smallville and similar TV shows. This movie is just fanservice using the dumbest cliches and tricks from comic books.CGI is over the top and as it breaks way too often a basic level of physics and common sense it becomes meaningless. The acting is quite bad, too.", "A MASTERPIECE": "The best MARVEL movie ever. This movie is perfect in ever way. This is a much watch for everyone.10/10. No exception, it's perfect. The best spiderman the best marvel best superhero movie.", "It's a really good film..........but it's a bit overrated": "Ok i know this review is late\nI saw this movie on December 24th 2021 yeah that's right Christmas Eve I was hearing everyone over the sun praising this movie and acting like it was the second coming of christ for some reason, so my expectation were set high and I saw it and walked out of the theatre and i was like \"it was great\" not like everybody else saying it was the best superhero film or the best marvel movie ever made but it was not the movies fault it was more marvel and the internet leakers who i hate with a passion that ruined it for mei know what your thinking\n\"ok i get the leakers but why marvel?\"\nwell person who didn't really ask the question\nit's Because of the amount of superhero movies marvel pumps out a year and it's exhausting for me i just want a years break with no superhero movies at allbut anyway sidetrackedThis movie is without a doubt the best spiderman movie i liked the inclusion of the villains from past movie and spidermans from past movies i thought it was a great call back and my nostalgia was tingling so it's a fantastic film and deserves every recognition it's got but as i was saying i probably would've liked it more if the internet didn't ruin it for me.", "Action, nostalgia, emotions at the top of the meaning": "This is the most successful mix of Sony and Marvel. It's the result of a very good fusion. It is not Marvel or Sony, it's the sum of both and the result of a memorable union.Despite being pure fanservice, the film successfully delivers a plot full of action, emotions, and nostalgia, making this last concept its main weapon of attack on an eager and incisive audience to re-fill movie theaters and fill the empty spaces in his conspiracy theories regarding the actual making of the film.The framework where the story takes place joins the epicity of the multiversal concept, which will be groped ad nauseam through the genre. Great action sequences, violent confrontations above the normal in previous films and justified emotions that feel like a goodbye and also a new beginning.Unfortunately not everything is perfect. There were situations too convenient for the development of the plot. Overly simple explanations and solutions that are only justified in a superhero movie. There are some weird editing jumps, but they don't affect the pacing of the film, which by the way, was inconsistent at times. Lastly, there were certain characters appearances that exist just to meet expectations and serve no general purpose.Still, all things considered, it feels like a good arachnid movie. The protagonist has managed to mature his character in a good way and feels one of his best performances in the role.Recommended for those who follow the entire Marvel storyline, even outside of the MCU.", "Amazing,Spectacular and Spiderman": "This movie is golden.From one side is full with meme references, full with sweet memories and nice fights and from the others side very emotional, powerful and heartbreaking.I enjoyed this movie as I enjoyed the first spiderman movie that I saw in the cinema with Tobey Maguire as Spiderman and William Defoe as Green Goblin, the accuracy comic wise was amazing too.Thank you MCU that you made this movie and the true spiderman fans can enjoy.For me 10/10.", "I loved it!better than homecoming and far from home": "Oh man!

Yes\nDid it deserve the hype? Yes\nIt was full with memes and reference from past movies other movies and other series.Happy watching!", "movie of the year": "This one had all the feels of the old Spiderman films. The cameos were awesome. This guy is a great Spidey. My only complaint is MJ has been a red-head since day one. The movie was long and cutting the first big Dr. Strange scene down would have got it down to 2 hours. Overall amazing. I've seen 50 theater movies since the pandemic with 2-12 people. This was a full theater! Maybe we can save the movie industry from this mandate insanity.", "The Purest of Gold of 2021": "Marvel and Sony continues to amaze me. From the moment it starts, it was terrific to the last post credit scene. Tom Holland is an awesome Spider-Man. Mysterio truly messed up Spider-Man/ Peter Parker. Apparently, since his identity went public, his friends can not attend college.Dr. Strange involvement felt so star striking. It opened doors to a different multi-verse and out comes the villains that made us smile from ear to ear.I will stop it from here. Their too many great surprises. From here on out. No Spider-Man movie or any other marvel movie can top this insanely awesome movie. This is the most greatest movie I have ever had seen. I am grateful to witness this that I can now die happy.That's how great it was.", "Good, not great": "First half is not that good, second half is amazing tho. The movie started out with everyone knowing Peter Parker is Spider-Man and you see the consequences bit I do think a problem was the lack of attention of spider man being a murderer.", "With great power comes with great responsibility": "This movie was insane I would give it a 10. Love the storyline and how the characters came together and it all went smoothly .most movies somehow start getting boring throughout the ending but Sony and marvel made it so there would be humour and comedy with them such as when Andrew Garfield was grossed out seeing the webs coming out his skin and how he had to crawl around to prove he was Spiderman it was just a great movie wouldn't hesitate to watch it again.", "A big toy for overgrown children!": "Homecoming and far from home were nice, but this one... This film is based on a script that looks like it was written by a 7 years old boy, with the difference that a 7 years old boy would've written it better. Feige is great because he understood that MCU fans just want to see all the characters they love, without even the necessity to write a plot consistent with previous films, or even a plot that isn't stupid. I've never seen so many nonsense, plot holes, and such flat characters in my life. Tobey Maguire didn't even believe it while acting. Why didn't Dr Strange use the memory spell to make Thanos forget about the obsession for the destruction of half the universe in previous films? Then electro changing color, haircut and overalls, because \"the energy of this dimension is different\". I don't understand why Lizard is made with such a horrifying cgi. I don't understand why Strange became so naive and stupid... first he makes that very dangerous spell that he didn't make 2 or 3 films before to stop Thanos; then he gets fooled by a child because he's good at math. For the rest of the film it is completely discarded, that's how well the character is treated. They rejuvenated Willem Dafoe with CGI instead Tobey Maguire was left natural. There are characters from different dimensions who are not even presented but recognize each other. Anyway, the plot is the same of a 90s video game: go get the bad guys and put them inside these cages (yes, they even send MJ to get them). Then randomly Osborn manages to recreate the famous green serum. Tobey Maguire is stabbed on the finale by Goblin and looks like he dies, but then, for no reason, he gets well right away. And there are many other problems with this movie but I'm tired and I think I showed what I was interested in demonstrating. By now you can give people the worst stuff ever created , but if you throw in disconnected and meaningless elements, but that they adore, then you got them. Luckily I'm already forgetting most of the movie, since it's horrible and forgettable.", "A Tangled Web of Nonsense": "This humourless and protracted plot seems to me like it was written by a few frat boys over beer after just graduating from their first screenwriting class. It was full of platitudes and banal dialogue. A jumbled mix of magic and mayhem, the plot hinged on the idea of the multiverse.The novel twist, based on this concept of the multiverse--which reminded me of the latest Matrix reboot--was that all three actors who have played Peter Parker & Spiderman came together in this film--all from different universes. It reminded me of The Matrix Resurrections because both films tried to revive the franchise by using a clever plot twist which - in my opinion-failed in both films.In Spider-Man: No Way Home, there is no meaningful arc to the story. It's a mishmash of ideas that barely hold together as a movie. What a pity to see Benedict Cumberbatch's outsized talent reduced to the two dimensional Dr. Strange. And while Tom Holland emotes a lot in the film, he comes across more as an insecure adolescent than a superhero.There seemed to be little chemistry between Spiderman and his girlfriend, MJ, and I felt nothing when Peter was crying over his dead Aunt May. I suppose this is because I wasn't invested in the story. It was too disjointed and meaningless to make me care about any of these characters.In trying to humanize and add more depth to superheros--a trend which I've noticed in other Marvel movies--I think they've gone too far. The characters swing back and forth between feeble wimps and smug superheros, making it hard for a moviegoer to suspend their disbelief. Yes, some measure of sensitivity and vulnerability adds complexity and depth to a superhero's character, but there's a fine line between hero and zero, and it seems like many of the marvel characters have crossed it.The first Spiderman movie was my favorite. There was a simple arc, a clear story line, and just the right balance between strength and sensitivity. In trying to milk the Spiderman franchise for all it's worth, it seems that the original storyline has been diluted beyond recognition. This latest iteration seems aimed at tweens and teens. In my opinion it has little or nothing to offer more mature moviegoers-say anyone over the age of 25!In all honesty, I've become tired of the endless parade of superhero movies which leave me wanting a more meaningful and down-to-earth story. Maybe I've just outgrown this genre. Nowadays I relish the more humble and human superpowers like empathy, kindness, courage, creativity, passion and purpose.", "BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE": "This movie has everything\nSoundtrack\nActing\nStory\nEntertainment factor\nTom Holland is the best Spider-Man\nThis is the best Spider-Man movie.The cinematography is insane as well\nNot going to spoil anything but let's just say\nFan service was done PERFECTLY.", "oh my!": "Where do I even start? The visuals are extremely good. They are IMPRESSIVE TO SAY THE LEAST. My mouth was wide open during the entire movie. It absolutely gorgeous: From views of the city to the morphing that happens when dr strange is chasing Peter. It's out of this world. Also,Big big kudos to Tom Holland and his outstanding performance ; he showed a ton of emotion and was natural with his voice and movement. In my opinion, his acting will 100% exceed most older and well known actors. But the only problem I found is the ending. I feel it left too much un-touched and was way too depressing. To sum up everything said, this is one of the best (if not the best) movie marvel has ever released because of the amazing acting or the amazing plot (Which merges other Spider-Man verses together and gives that sense of nostalgia every Spider-Man fan craved) or the outstanding camera work and visuals, I can't wait for what comes next in Spider-Man's story.", "A little predicatable and drawn out": "I was gonna give this movie a 6.5 but the graphics in certain scenes namely the scene when Tom is running from Dr. Strange and the end fight were pretty well done. The storyline was decent not great. Basically old villains and spidermans were released because of a spell. It was entertaining but the scene with May dying and the post fight scenes with Tom and his friends were drawn out and highly predictable. Could have made it more suspenseful or something.", "Plot hole as big as The Last Jedi": "Why didn't Strange erase memory of Thanos?Dr. Strange suggesting and actually brainwashing entire population? Isn't that what villains do?Spiderman is one of my absolute favorite Marvel superhero but MCU version is just annoying brat. He's supposed to be THE man. I mean the way he interrupted Strange's spellcasting, and ended up doing what they were initially going to do anyway? Only that aunt May had to die in the process? I do not sympathize with that Spiderman. I actually sympathize with Jameson that everywhere this Spiderman goes, there's \"needless\" destruction and death.These two Avengers plotting to risk the fabric of the Universe for their personal gain. Those are villains. This is just bad writing.And 3 Peters came up with cures for all of those villains in a few hours with whatever Stark left behind? Can't they do that for Banner? I'm pretty sure he actually wants to be cured.This movie is just cashing in on nostalgia and it worked. But it left gaping plot holes thanks to careless writing.", "An entertaining movie, but not a 9": "The movie is entertaining with a lot of humour. But its nowhere near a rating above 8.There are so many story and logic mistakes, which at least I couldnt ignore.", "If youve seen the other spiderman movies, this is a must see": "This movie us a must see for any Spiderman and Marvel fan. So mutch hype. I wish i could experience this again without spoilers this time.Andrew, Toms, and Tobeys Peter Parkers interaction with eachother was everything a Spiderman fan could ask for. So were the villans of Doc Oc, Green Goblin and Electro. It is so great to see them again, and wrap up their stories, including those of the 2 spidermen, and actually, Tom Hollands Spiderman aswell in a way. Id actually would have loved to see half an hour more of these 3.The other 2 villans however more or less seemed liked afterthroughts to fluff up the cast. They didnt have mutch thought put behind them or mutch to do. But i suppose its best to focus on more important characters.Dr. Strange, howevermutch i liked seeing him again, including that awesome fight, was also a bit... Strangely written.Some scenes settings were also a tad weird, like having the big reveal of the spidermen taking place in Neds grandmothers bedroom. Id prefer something more grand for such a reveal, like for instance, the top of a building, or even Peters house.The anti spiderman sentiment and trouble with the law plot was also kinda dropped. I would have prefered to have seen this be resolved with a trial or something like that.The flaws of this movie were masked by the amazing concept of the characters from previous movies comming back, wich, they handled greatly. This does make me worry for the other comming movies where not such a hypeworthy concept will take place i must expect, and i dont know if they can learn from these existing flaws of strange character motives and dropped plot concepts.As for the end, i do really like how they made spiderman feel like a real spiderman. As if the previous movies were all about growing up to be a responsible adult, and now he is. I am curious to where they will take Peter Parker and Spiderman in the future, eventhough i am never quite a fan of characters memory being wiped, it kind of feels like everything that happened before does mot matter anymore. History is decided by those who remember it.", "Good fan service film": "It's pure fan service but not in a bad way, they actually manage to prevent common plot holes in fan service films in a smart way.It's very ambitious, with an epic and huge in scope story, great direction, music, character development, acting, visual effects and more.It has many emotional, thrilling and exciting moments, it's a one on a lifetime experience. You will enjoy it so much.", "The Strongest Spiderman installment yet.": "I love Tom Holland as Spiderman, but I also thoroughly enjoyed Andrew G and Toby M just as much in their day. Though I love Tom, I thought the first two installments had rather cheesy storylines unlike generation one and two. I was pleasantly surprised on how strong this movie was and I thought it was the strongest Spider-Man movie thus far, probably because they managed to incorporate all three of the hero's and their villains seamlessly. Loved it. Great job to all three.", "Very bad": "It's worse than Deadpool. I only watched one minute and 30 seconds before I shut it down. It was just so cringe. The CGI of \"Spider-Man\" was cringe, the news broadcast was cringe, everything was cringe. I just couldn't stand one more second of it.How could anyone involved with this movie think that stuff is funny? Boggles my mind.", "Movie of the year": "It's too bad the Oscar's never recognize super hero movies, because this movie deserves every single award. I laughed, I cried, and I was amazed. Bought tickets to go see it for a second time because it's truly an adventure I want to go on again and again.", "You're losing your touch Marvel": "I was sceptical about going to watch this film, because after all the spoilers that came out on social media (courtesy of Tom Holland) I thought that there would be no surprises in the movie. However, being a dedicated Marvel fan I believed they will surpass whatever they have shown in the trailers. I was so wrong.Let's begin with the appearances of the other 2 Spidermen, Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire. All of us knew they are in the movie, courtesy of spoilers, but could their appearances not have been atleast at different points in the movie? Instead they appear one after the other, like some TV show hosts. As soon as you see the second gateway being opened by Ned, you know it's gonna be Toby. Since when did Marvel movies become so predictable? Also, they showed all the villains from multiverses in the trailers. ALL OF THEM! Why couldn't you keep atleast one hidden for the movie? A little bit of suspense maybe?Then comes the fight/action sequences. I daresay that this movie has the worst/least exciting fight sequences in all the 8 Spiderman live action movies ever made. Don't agree with me? Remember the last fight sequence from 'Far From Home', and how Spidey just ravages through Mysterio's drones, or the Electro vs. Spidey in The Amazing spiderman 2 with Garfield. The sequences in this movie are way too weak, when you take into consideration that it has triple the strength.Some good bits though, like how the have portrayed Aunt May, and her importance in Peter's life. Really loved it. Also, Daredevil's appearance was a shocker, although nothing much came out of it. And I have always loved Benedict Cumberbatch's comic timing as Dr. Strange, or Stephen. But all in all, this was a just a dent in a legacy overhyped by overpaid teenagers on social media, and people going gaga over it without even setting real expectations. Very disappointed!", "The Finest Outing For The MCU Spider-Man So Far": "Tapping into the fundamental tragedy in Peter Parker's arc that has always been the foundational & emotional core of his friendly neighbourhood persona, Spider-Man: No Way Home at long last provides the eponymous character a journey worth investing into and marks his finest outing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far, even if the film still plays by the established formula of the franchise.Directed by Jon Watts, this 27th instalment in the MCU picks up right where Far From Home left off and comes laden with quips, cameos & fan service as expected but the way it navigates the threads of past & present to weave together a story that celebrates the legacy of the character while shaping a fascinating future to look forward to is what makes it such a welcome & wholesome delight with a satisfying payoff.Still, even if the film balances its myriad of characters surprisingly well and gives them their fair share of screen time, it isn't without its shortcomings. The dialogues & interactions are cringey, the technical execution is bland for the most part, camerawork is meh, editing during the action sequences is awful, visual effects are poor for a $200 million blockbuster and Michael Giacchino's score is also serviceable at best.Overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home gives the old & new fans exactly what they came looking for and makes for a thoroughly enjoyable & entertaining extravaganza that will please most viewers if not all. There are some emotionally resonant moments that definitely stand out & elevate the ride but there was also room for plenty of improvement in several areas. One of the better entries in the MCU canon, this grand reunion of three generations is a must for every Spider-Man fan out there.", "This movie is something so epic, so exciting, and so satisfying.": "It's such an ambitious and risky film project. It's something never seen before, and that makes it something special and unique. To have all three Spider-Men from all the franchises and with their respective villains together is glorious. Nothing more to say. Thank you Sony and Marvel. The acting, VFX and the direction was really great! One of the best combinations of comedy, action, emotion and darkness. And also, Tobey and Andrew are back; need I say more?", "I just need a minute to catch my breath": "This is not a flawless movie. Some of the dialogue felt jarring, a couple of the characters two dimensional and it is undeniably silly. It had plot holes and left quite a few loose ends and unanswered questions.

What I'm most impressed by is the solid ACTING in this movie.... Tom Holland is awesome as Spidey, but I've always preferred Tobey McGuire's version the most. In this movie, I believe Tobey came in 3rd- either by design or by effort.Tom Holland showed much more emotion in this movie, that was enjoyable. Andrew Garfield, formerly my least favorite Spidey, was #2 in this movie. His portrayal showed pain, and a seething torture right below the surface he's trying to contain. Tobey didn't seem as fully engaged in this one, but still held his own. It was great to see him back on the big screen.However, as impressed as I was with thee Spider Men, the bad guys nearly stole the show. Willem Dafoe hasn't lost a step. That dude is amazing. And Alfred Molina.... Wow. That guy can go from a warm and inviting personality, to an absolutely intimidating character, and back. Everyone did well, but I think it's a split decision between Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina. Those gentlemen came to play, and they didn't \"let\" Tom Holland, or anyone else out-shine them...Great movie, and well worth the price of admission.", "The dark spider": "This film is just everything you can expect from a superhero movie and a lot more. Every little second in the film is entertaining, the performances are fantastic and the script is awesome. If you want to go with the spidey on an emocional journey this is the best you can get. It is as if Chris Nolan and Sam Raimi made a film together. At the end you get what heroes are really here for...making the world a better place. In our real world many people with power are corrupted, selfish and Evil but on this fantasy world you can't get these powers in better hands than these three exceptional human beings. To sum up, this is not the godfather but It is a remarkable entertainment which Will make you forget whatever circumstances you are going through for a couple if hours.Give the spidey a chance to entertain you, you won't regret It. Long live Spiderman.", "The peak of the MCU": "Yes, you read the title right, I will go as far as saying no way home is the greatest MCU movie ever, the death of aunt may nearly made me cry, but I found it dumb that the script made her say that she's fine after what happened in her apartment and then says with great power comes great responsibility, and then she instantly dies, it was emotional but it wasn't executed perfectly, I liked the inclusion of doctor strange, every single attempt at comedy made me laugh, while the plot of the movie might make it seem like it's fan service, it was still handled very seriously and not like some YouTube fanfiction, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were so great in this, their chemistry with each other and Tom Holland is iconic and gave us some of the most iconic moments in film history, the movie may have 5 villians, but unlike Spider-Man 3 or TASM 2 where it just overloads our mind on which plot we're supposed to focus on, this Spider-Man movie just puts it all together to make an easy to follow story, I also love the line by electro, \"I wish there was a black Spider-Man\", like, there is a whole movie about him and it's made by this same studio, and it's even better than this, but that's not to bring down this movie because this movie is amazing, Zendaya is still great as mj, Willem Dafoe is still excellent as green goblin, this movie is unlike any other movie I have ever seen, the ending made me want to cry because spiderman gave up everything for everyone, it's the perfect ending to a near perfect movie.", "Was decent, but could have been far better!!!": "I remember when movies utilized good writing and not just contrived plots to move the story.... now it's just gaining the most profit for the least work. Laziness ftw.", "Good Movie to watch": "For the first time in nearly 20 years, I may have seen my favorite Spider-Man movie.And I'm not like a kid who loves the Ice Age movies and since part 17 is the newest one they've seen, it's their favorite. (Much like what they said about the 16 before it.) Nope. I sat from almost the first 10 minutes LOVING this movie and debating if this actually beat out the magnificent 2002's Spider-Man and its even better follow-up, 2004's Spider-Man 2.I will say this: This is my new 2nd favorite of ALL 27 MCU movies. Easy. And it's easily in the top three of the 10 theatrical-released Spider-Man movies. In fact, since part 2 in 2004, I have not been impressed with any of the Spider-Man movies until Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse and this third Tom Holland-led Spider-Man series.I barely liked Tom's Spider-Man: Homecoming and I refer to it Iron Man Jr because it was WAY more about Iron Man smarts and involvement and it clearly made Peter a complete moron who couldn't lift a finger or figure out anything on his own without big-daddy Tony helping. Tom's Spider-Man: Far From Home was better, but it still couldn't let go of Tony (EVEN after his character supposedly left the franchise.) This second rebooted version of Spider-Man of Tom Holland's made me sad, because of how dumb Peter is and how reliant he is on others, namely big-daddy Tony. This is NOT the brilliant Peter Parker I grew up with.But, FINALLY...they got it right with Tom's third movie. The trailer spoiled SO MUCH of this movie and the actors involved, as trailers are designed to be spoiler packed (usually the very last scene of the movie is in the trailer,) so I won't even go into the synopsis or what happens or who's in it. I just HIGHLY encourage you to see this ASAP and know: they FINALLY got Spider-Man right. After 5 disappointing follow-ups to Spider-Man 2, THEY FINALLY GOT SPIDER-MAN BACK ON TRACK.I laughed so hard, even though it wasn't like the traditional MCU movie where it's mostly a comedy. These were genuine jokes and not just inserted to please the audience who apparently wants more comedic MCU movies than action-packed Super-Hero movies. I cried a bit, even though it's mostly an uplifting movie. And yes, I marveled on how well acted and written this film is. Everybody gave it their 110% and no one stole scenes or out-performed anyone else. This was MY Endgame event.I loved this movie so much, I probably will buy it right away on Blu upon release. And to give you a hint of how much that is to me: I don't really buy Blurays anymore due to the convenience of streaming and of ALL 27 MCU movies, I only bought two so far. The rest, I can watch online if I feel like it. Most are forgettable, anyways.I heard they're building a new trilogy with Tom Holland continuing his role as Spidey. To be frank, before this viewing, I almost didn't want to see them. If this turned out just slightly better than Tom's 2nd one which was just slightly better than his mediocre 1st one, I was pretty much done.Now, my Spidey-Sense is tingling to see what they have in store for us next.", "This movie is really amazing": "Really enjoyed it. Loved the story . Tom Holland has really done an amazing work. The appearances of the key characters was too good . Loved and enjoyed every second of it!", "Perfect movie for spiderman fans, relive childhood": "Wow a perfect marvel movie for hardcore marvel fans, can't help but to shout on every action scenes. Spiderman at its best. Reliving childhood memories goosebump moments. What a movie hats off MARVEL. The quotes and messages in movie are just awesome. You get inspired by them. Go and enjoy, not to miss!", "A masterpiece": "I never felt like this about a movie before. I almost get emotional just thinking about it. Infinity War and Endgame were amazing but Marvel lifted themselves to a whole other level. For the Marvel fans this movie is a masterpiece. Everything a fan could wish for is this movie. The fact that Marvel made this movie only makes me love them more.", "inflated fan-service": "Due to the seriously inflated fan-service rating, I'm rating this slightly lower than I usually would.Like most folks, I'm here for Tobey Maguire. My hopes that he would put in an appearance is my sole reason for watching this movie, and he did not disappoint. I loved seeing him, and I loved watching my sister panic when she thought he died, and just, yeah, all the feels going on there.But that fan-service and my nostalgia does not make this an amazing movie. Just like the 2nd film in Tom Holland's Spider-Man franchise, I could predict practically everything that happened. And I think it's beyond absurd that Dr. Strange would agree to Baby Holland Peter's desperate little plea and make such a mess of things. I just can't even with the craziness.Another reviewer mentioned this being a movie about first-world problems, and yeah, it pretty much is. I went to a university that cost me $10k out of pocket and I love and use my degree. Not getting into MIT wouldn't be the end of the world, and he should have thought to talk to the university first before trying to have Strange wipe memories. It was ridiculous and I was disappointed.I love Holland as Spider-Man, but all of the movies since Homecoming have been steadily going downhill. No Way Home had literally no plot apart from the nostalgia and wiping memories bit, so at the end of the day, Disney didn't give us anything. I could watch Thor Ragnarok on repeat, but the only reason I would watch No Way Home again is if I want to re-experience the warm fuzzies I will always have for Tobey Maguire.On the flip-side, I did love the healing that went on for Tobey's \"villains.\" Because let's be honest, pretty much none of them were actual villains. Bad stuff happened to each of them to change them biologically, so I love that sort of rebirth thing they did. Oh yeah, and Garfield's here too along with his villains. I was never a fan of his so his presence made no never-mind to me.Overall, No Way Home is a trip down memory lane but little else. Some official critic called it \"feel good family fun\" and that couldn't be further from the truth. It's violent and scary, so yeah, don't fall for that line from the critics. Is it worth seeing? Yes, I enjoyed it enough that I'm glad I went to the theater. But 8.9 stars worth it is not.", "Everything we asked for!": "This movie was just SPOT ON! I wont spoil anything but this movie delivered very greatly. We saw all the villans we love back on the big screen, and some very emotional scenes as well!Now i will say, some scenes overuse Cgi to the point where it looks wonky, but it doesnt really bother meMAKE SURE TO WATCH THAT POST CREDIT SCENE!!", "The best spider-man movies": "I loved every second of it.Tom halland in this movie made a perfect performance.And oh my god tobey maguire is my favorite spider-man.The story and music is good.You should see it.", "The best of the best": "For any Spider-Man fan this is a must watch, absolutely unreal and now my favourite film of all time - Tom Holland is such a great Spider-Man, could even be the best. I wish I could watch this again for the first time.", "If you are Marvel Super Fan, you will Like this": "This genre just isn't for me. I enjoyed the Toby Maguire Spider Man - I was a kid at the time and was like, SWEET - the real story of Spiderman brought to the movies! ... and then I realized there is this \"multi-verse\" thing that lets people make any story of Spider Man you want, with several trilogies going along with them, and that with Doctor Strange, the multi-verses can somehow converge, and then it makes for some fun movies as you converge the different stories, etc. So many super heroes in so many places that can converge at any moment with a quick flick of the wrist or miss-hap by someone. I mean, it just doesn't turn me on anymore.I mean - sounds cool, but man that is so overkill for me. The movie is exciting, the sounds and action scenes are cool, but with the over crowding of super hero movies, I'm just not feeling the emotion anymore. The actors are good at getting teary eyed when they need to, they put on serious faces when they have to, but each scene, I'm just like, \"yea, yea...I get it...you have to bring some emotion into this to make it relate to me...\"The funny one liners are fine - like, it's well scripted to that point, but they fall flat for people that are tired of the same old same old super hero movies where everything is fine in the end (in some way).I guess I'm stuck enjoying the super hero movies like Deadpool - where there is blatant acknowledgement that everything is a bit ridiculous, so they add very witty humor to the whole thing making it very enjoyable.", "Best Spider-Man Movie Bar None": "My husband is the Marvel connoisseur, and he whooped, fist pumped the air, and cheered. I am a medium Marvel fan (I have seen all the new-ish Marvel movies and two of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man films) and I clapped and cheered-cried, even! My sister is not a Marvel fan, and has not seen any Spider-Man movie before this one. She loved the movie, and cheered for the major plot points. My point being, all movie goers will enjoy this film, whether you know all the references or not. We will be going back to see the movie again for sure!", "I am now a Spider-Man fan!!!": "I am in no way a Spider-Man fan at all. I will admit that I have not seen all the films that have been made over the years about this character. For whatever reason he has always been my least favourite superhero to see on screen, that is until now!!! This film is truly joyful to watch from start to finish and is one of the best films Marvel and Disney have made!!!Although I have not seen all the Spiderman films portrayed by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, I have seen all the appearances in film by Tom Holland. I thought that \"Homecoming\" was ok but a bit lack lustre for me, \"Far From Home\" was a major improvement and a film I very much enjoy. \"No Way Home\" has smashed both of those films by miles and miles. I'll go as far to say that it might have turned me into a Spider-Man fan !!!Jon Watts, you, the writers and Kevin Feige have delivered a film that will not only please fans of Tom Holland's Spider-Man but ALL comic book fans in general. This to me is what comic book films can be, a story that deals with a very real issue but deals with it in a fantastical way. The message is still the same yet it is told upon an extravagant background. Congrats on a brilliant film!I cant not mention the massive elephant in the room, the multiverse cross-over of multiple characters.....in particular Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield appearing in the film. Also the huge array of villains from those films also appearing, plus all the original actors that played them blows my mind. Remember this comes from someone that doesn't care whatsoever about this franchise but I have to admit, I was emotional and fist pumping at moments throughout. The interaction all 3 Peter Parker's have is just awesome and all of them get their multiple moments to shine. One moment in particular got me chocked up a bit, where Garfield's Spider-Man saves MJ when she is falling. Exactly like Gwen was in his film (whichever one it was), however this time he saves MJ......the look on his face.......just wow !! There are plenty of examples like this throughout the film that are just so perfect!!Holland, Maguire, Garfield, Zendaya, Cumberbatch (how could I forget), Tomei, Dafoe, Molina, Hayden Church, Ifans, Foxx and Simmons are all so (insert swear word) - ing good hahahaha. Its just beautiful to watch all of them reprise or continue in roles they are all great in.Oh also not forgetting the Aunt May death and the ending, plus the obvious post credit reveals. The film needed a big emotion punch and my word did it have one!! I sort of assumed before watching the film that Aunt May was on borrowed time slightly, without sounding too horrible haha. So I wasn't shocked so much the character died but was surprised how and the impact that had. So well done, it meant something and was very rewarding for the story. In a weird way I love the fact that the ending isn't actually a good one in some ways, yes Holland's Spider-Man sent everyone back and \"saved the day\" but he also lost so much. Its very bold by Disney and I think it'll help in the long run!! As for the post credit scenes, boy I hope that means Tom Hardy is gonna appear in a MCU film one day that would be good. As for Doctor Strange, who knows where they go with that franchise moving forward?The only negative about the film I have and its the same with every MCU film, humour!!! There is too much of it as usual and a lot of the jokes don't land but you cant have everything can you haha.Overall I am utterly blown away by this film and cannot wait to watch it again!! 85% out of 100 I actually think this might be the best MCU film to date. This is coming from someone who doesn't care about these films at all and didn't like Spider-Man whatsoever. However its made me a fan from now on !!! I will be amazed if someone doesn't like this or was disappointed, this is a must watch!!!", "Failed in everything it could have been": "Spiderman no way home could've been the best MCU film since infinity war. It could've been a culmination of everything great about Spider-Man. But for me, it's cringe worthy dialogue, extremely generic fight scenes (apart from Dr Stranges one) and the forced plot points just ruined it for me. Sure the special effects are fantastic, character designs are cool and the score is great, but everything else just wasn't. Nothing within the film was very influential to the MCU's massive story either.All in all, if your hoping for a big MCU phenomenon like infinity war prior, you will be disappointed.", "The best Spider-Man movie to date": "This movie is the best Spider-Man movie to date. It is made to be everything that a fan wanted in a movie of the web slinger.The cinematography is fantastic, the plot, the characters, the acting. Everything is superb. I love how they stayed true to all characters from the past, their personality and backstories.I really think that it will be a herculean task to top this in the future. It is one os the best superhero movies of all time and I can't see how they could get any better than this.", "Best one by far": "Having seen every Spider-Man movie made to date, this one is by far the best and most well rounded . It had all the characteristics you want in an action movie. Plot, humor , surprises and action. There's a reason it's doing so well at the box office. Highly recommend.", "Beginning of MCU's Spidey": "Look how the character development of the Spider-Man series.

It was actually fun to see my boys tobey and andrew. But the movie has its flaws like almost every marvel movie. Like for an example for what reason should dr.strange help him out this way in the first place. There so many illogical writing decisions just to make it possible for us to see all 3 spidermans on one screen...and u know what? I'm not even mad about it. The movie entertained me and that is the most important thing for me when I'm watching a mcu movie(I don't expect complex writing or much logic when watching mcu). So why then do I give a 7 rating. I would like to give it a 8 but I can't really believe that this is 9.1 rated at the moment when I'm writing this. By any means this movie is not a top 10 let alone top 50 movie of all time. For me it's probably the best marvel movie but nothing more. I can understand why marvel fans would say that this is their favourite movie of all time. But in the end nostalgia is the cause for this kind of rating and that's not right in my opinion.8/10.", "Spider Man Is Move Very Interested.": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic, big, and one of the best Spider Man films of all time. Literally nothing is holding this film back which the script contains about everything. And director Jon Watts making the best spider man movie ever. Fans and non fans are going to love the film. The story is best to go without any spoilers. There are many surprises that will leave the crowd cheering. Story also goes into an emotional direction and making the film feeling like a conclusion to the trilogy. Characters story arcs coming to an end. While opening up more possibilities to where the direction can go.", "Very Nice Movie": "This Movie Is Very Nice & Knowgbale. And Good Quwality This Movie Veri Intersted Movie. This Movie is Very Inspired Me. Morvel Thank For This Movie And Good Luck For Create That Movies And Adventure Movie Very Interesting & Inspired Me.", "The most emotional and satisfying cinematic experience of my entire life": "Walking out of the cinema after watching Spider-man: No Way Home, I was absolutely shocked and amazed to the point where I was shaking and struggling to not cry. As an avid Marvel and Spider-man fan, this movie was extremely satisfying to watch. I absolutely adored the new dimensions given to Tom Holland's Spider-man and how the original story of Spider-man was integrated into this franchise. Also loved the Andrew Garfield Spider-man reveal (almost everyone in the cinema audibly gasped) and how we got to check in on Tobey and Andrew's spidey-selves (Andrew cracking Tobey's back for him? Absolute gold). The character deaths were heart-wrenching and beautifully executed, and the teasers we got for the next spider-man trilogy and Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness in the post-credit scenes made me very excited for the next phase of Marvel (and especially how this movie may interact with the Disney Plus shows). Overall, this film is by far one of the most amazing movies I've ever watched, period. I would recommend this to anyone who has watched the previous Spider-man series' and/or has watched any of the recent Marvel productions.", "MIND BLOWN": "In my completely biased opinion, I am in awe of how good this film is, truly. The box office is going to be through the roof.I remember when people wanted a DC x Marvel crossover in Endgame, and now there were rumours speculating Andrew and Tobey being in the movie. Even though most people expected it, it was still surprising when they entered the portal somehow. Everyone including myself screamed and it's not only that, but the dynamic they gave it. The ending made me sob like a baby, Marvel cannot keep getting away with this. Overall, incredible movie, great script & acting!", "BIG DISAPPOINTMENT": "The movie was mid , Darling\nJust The spidermen and old villans, Andrew saves Mid MJ and overall they get back to Their own places\nMy fav spiderman is Tobey and Ardrew Goatfield too but Holland was mid in the three movies and with avengers, Really I love him in The devil all the time and uncharted and cherry\nThis character doesn't suit him at all, over all this rating 2 for two spidermen.", "The closure": "The spacious thing about this movie is the closer of all Spider-Mans movies. And the way they give give the viewer the story is so special and so unique.", "Not better than Spider Man 2002 but great movie!": "I won't spoil anything but just say it was cool the way the movie was written and acted out. I won't say it's better than Toby McGuire's spider man but it was very very good!!!!! Must see.", "My new favourite spiderman movie": "It was the best one so far, great Spiderman movie. The production is such a high quality, and the plot was really well written. Will be watching it again.", "Wasted potential": "This movie was just riding off of the back of nostalgia and completely ruined the sense the movie should have carried. The writing was lazy and Peter's reason for casting the spell was pathetic.... definitely an overrated film.", "A very disappointing film": "I have to admit, I didn't expect much from the film. I expected a good but not great movie, plot wise, with incredible action scenes and CGI- the usual Marvel experience. However, I was wildly disappointed.PETER PARKER(Tom Holland)- is a horrible protagonist. He might as well be the antagonist since all he does is screw up. He makes Dr. Strange fudge up his spell, then attacks him when he tries to help him correct his mistakes. He keeps spouting about 'morality'and 'saving everyone' yet he tries to kill Goblin (which he knows is mentally deranged) as revenge for aunt May. He makes stupid decisions throughout the whole movie, like letting out the villains when he could've just worked out a solution while they were in confine. This decision ultimately leads to aunt May's death.ZENDAYA- was not a good part of the film. She constantly felt snobbish and added little to no value to the movie. Every scene with her felt stale.AUNT MAY- sucked. I hated aunt May. Her whole shtick of 'let's heal them' is incredibly moronic because 1)those are lethal hostile people who have shown no intention for reform themselves and 2) they need to be sent back to their universe because saving a few people in front of you is more important than saving the multiverse. This philosophy leads to ending where Peter gets punished for this by being erased from everyone's memories, essentially losing his life.SANDMAN- did not need to be saved. I do not understand what the hell they did with him. Why did he fight Spiderman in the final combat scene?? He holds the same interests as Peter and the others to go back to his universe. If he should be fighting anybody, it's Electro who has the opposite intent. This part made absolutely no sense to me.LIZARD MAN- cannot be saved. He is a scientist looking to make everyone a lizard as well. Why does turning him to a human 'save him'? Won't he just make himself lizard again and continue with his agenda? They did not address this at all.GREEN GOBLIN- was pretty cool. I liked Goblin in the movie, I guess he was the clich\u00e9 villain which tries to make the hero question his path but whatever. However, why didn't they keep him in confinement if he himself knew about his 'goblin' personality. If he truly wanted to do no harm wouldn't he just remain in the magic prison until his personality disorder can be fixed?BUGLE NEWS- was one of my favourite things in this movie. Through it they were able to criticize bombastic TV personas like Alex Jones, but if you listened closely to what he said you could agree with some of the things he says. At the end of the movie, after he forgets Spiderman's Identity, he demands that Spiderman shows his true Identity because only a coward hides his identity. I agree with this. Especially with law personnel, you want transparency. The whole idea of an unknown vigilante striking 'criminals' without any accountability would be very unsettling in our world, especially with the controversy today surrounding police brutality.ANDREW GARFIELD- was great. I loved him in this movie. He was likeable, empathetic and responsible. He was the best Spiderman in this movie, by far. The scene when he got closure by saving Zendaya was great.THE FIRST HALF OF THE FILM- was very boring. There was almost nothing interesting going on. I could've eaten dinner during the start, come back to the movie around the halfway point and not miss much.I would not recommend watching the film. There are other superhero films that are better from Marvel. It wasn't an enjoyable film. It dragged on for too long and what it made the audience wait for was not worth it.", "Best superhero movie since Spider-Man 3": "This movie made me feel like I was watching a real superhero movie and not an mcu movie with cheap jokes and generic reused plotlines. I was finally watching another real superhero movie with developed characters and a great story I hadn't seen in years. It was shot beautifully and the only problems I can name are tiny nit picks. I would've hated Electro played by Jamie Fox but the writers turned him into a dumba$$ joke character, so i'm okay with him. The relationship between Tom Holland and Zendaya was my favorite part honestly, it was really emotional. I loved Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire so so much, I love the relationship between the three Spider-men and I cried watching this movie which doesn't happen very often.", "GOOOOOD": "I can hardly be called a metrosexual interested in high fashion, but even I was curious about the tragedy of the Gucci family. The world-famous story of the fall of one of the most famous brands, which is literally synonymous with the word 'wealth', was already ready-made material for the film, it only remained to properly dispose of the material. The film was taken up by none other than maestro Ridley Scott, known for a whole host of cult films (\"Alien\" and \"The Fall of the Black Hawk\") and the same mass of equally loud failures (\"Robin Hood\" and \"Adviser\"). Did he manage to implement such an interesting idea, or is it rather a blunder? It's a shame to say this, the second one is more suitable here.The main problem of the film is that it is staged without any frills, visual or narrative. There are, of course, chic costumes, but otherwise there is no highlight in the 'Gucci House'. The movie is absolutely bland and offers nothing. A straightforward story unfolds before us, running for two and a half hours and told without any revelations, and which can easily be found freely available on the Internet. Almost no moment of the film really catches, although there are scenes in which it was possible to roam. As an example, Maurizio Gucci, played by Adam Driver, is killed at the very end and it has no dramatic value, because almost everyone who wanted to watch the film knows that he will die. Empathize with the character also will not work, because there is no sympathy for him (we will return to this later). Could it have been done better? Of course! For example, you can start with the murder of Gucci, show part of the events of the film with flashbacks and scenes of the trial of Patricia Gucci (the trial, by the way, was never shown, although the plot here is also very interesting) and then wrap around the death of Maurizio. It would be much more interesting and the effect on the viewer would be much stronger here. But no, the story has remained just a dry retelling of well-known facts.Another significant disadvantage of the film is the characters. There are practically no complaints about the actors themselves, but the way their characters are shown in the Gucci House is questionable. Firstly, this is Patricia Gucci performed by Lady Gaga. The whole movie is not clear whether she really loves her husband, or just wants to squeeze money from him. And this is hardly done intentionally. It looks as if the screenwriter himself did not fully understand the essence of the hero. It was possible to easily build an intrigue based on the duality of her image, but there is nothing like that here. Secondly, this is Maurizio Gucci played by Adam Driver, who looks like he is an absolutely left-wing character. In reality, a real macho and lovelace here has turned into an insecure, self-doubting nerd, I'm not afraid to say. And everything would be fine, you can assume such a convention, but the problem is that in the second half of the film he abruptly becomes vindictive and angry after the hero has lost faith in Patricia. If Maurizio were the same here as in life, then such a change in the hero could be believed, but in this case such a sudden change of character from quiet and calm to unbalanced looks just ridiculous. About Summer in general, a separate topic. He overplays here so often and his image is so caricatured that it feels as if the hero he presented had escaped from some parody comedy or even a children's cartoon. Only Pacino and Irons were given adequately prescribed characters, although the latter is negligible in the film.But the biggest disadvantage of local heroes is that there is not a single gram of empathy for any of the heroes. Patricia, as described above, it is unclear what she is. Maurizio is initially presented as an idiot who fell in love with the first person he met, and then an embittered idiot who betrayed his family. Rudolfo (Maurizio's father) is shown as a typical narcissistic rich man. Paolo, in general, is just an unfunny caricature of a typical narrow-minded son. Only Aldo behaved adequately here, and then, by no means always. There is not one hero who would perform the function of an emotional core here and would cause the viewer at least some sympathy. It was possible to make a film about the near-Fonvizin heroes, since some of them are so grotesque here, but then the story should initially be made a satire about rich people who ruined themselves, and not a drama on serious topics. In the end, neither one nor the other really came out.As a result, we can say that the 'House of Gucci', rather, does not meet the expectations. Such an interesting story could have been realized many times better than it turned out in the end. Yes, this is not a completely lost film and maybe it's worth a look once, but for those who know about the interesting history of this family and those who were impressed by the impressive cast, they will leave the viewing rather disappointed. This is not even close to a pleasant surprise in the face of the 'Last Duel'. Unlike her, this movie is definitely mediocre. Expensive and lush like the Gucci themselves, but still mediocre.", "Childhood completed!": "Just brilliant. Had everything you want. If you were a kid when Toby Maguire was the man then this is just perfect. Enjoy! Reflects spider man greatly, MCU smashes it again. Just an emotional rollercoaster.", "only for kids": "Hollywood has lost ideas and creativity. By adding all the old heroes and villians, adding some fancy effects, you can only fascinate kids.I would not recommend. Just watch if you want to waste some money on a cheap production.", "An extremely very bad movie!": "If you don't want to waste your time and money, you should skip this movie. That such a bad movie I have ever seen!The whole story runs just around a stubborn kid who make the problem for everyone. At the end, the entire of characters do dumb ass like a kid. I think it would suitable for my nephew. I will never watch any Spider Man movie, so stupid and noisy!", "I didn't care": "I struggled through the movie, a few times I wanted to leave.It's long.The acting is rather good but nothing matters.Like watching birds fly except birds are pretty.A few surprises. I heard people list all spiderman actors, saying Andrew was irrelevant. To me Andrew was good, with Emma they made a terrific duo, one that mattered.I probably won't resist the next Doctor Strange either, let's hope it's better. That the comedic and romantic elements don't feel artificial.", "I was skeptical when I found out I will be watching it in 3D": "Went with my brother last night to watch it. He organized the whole thing, and when we got glasses I was like damn, because personally I am not that big of a fan of 3D.But boy oh boy am I glad that I was wrong!The way it is filmed, especially fighting scenes and other scenes where there's so much happening, it's stunning!Story is great, bringing Andrew and Tobey in it was great idea. Benedict brilliant as always. All in all, I think this was the best Spiderman movie yet.", "Thank you for this masterpiece": "Hands down a 10/10 film: it was way more than expected, and I've never enjoyed watching something as much as this. From its intense moments to its emotional ones, this was a brave approach by director Jon Watts, and he absolutely smashed it. Brilliant build-up and storytelling, and an unforgettable climax, I'm sure the fans across the world will be electric when they see this film. I foresee a shift in the box office records after this rollercoaster experience. Thank you for making my day and creating a masterpiece I will never forget.", "And now the Arc is complete!": "Watched it yesterday!Epic and satisfying Spider-Man movie ever with action and surprise.And Arguably best Spider-Man outing yet.This one tied all together in a way that will make 3 generation happy!It has moved the MCU on and repurposed the spidey film that came before.Don't miss it!", "Teenage drama": "The good thing: this movie has Tobey Maguire and Benedict Cumberbatch in it and some of the older bad crooks.The bad:\nThe storyline is lame. Parallel universe with multiple spidermans in it? Come on! They pretty much turn their hero into a most wanted criminal that's crying for most of the movie and doesn't really manage to redeem himself by the end of the movie.Tom Holland, his girlfriend in the movie and his best friend just aren't real actors. It feels like you're watching a teenage drama.Way too long. I thought of walking out after just an hour.Honestly, I don't know where the star reviews come from. This movie could have been so good with a descent script and just Tobey Maguire as Spiderman.", "Lessons I Learn!!! Spideyyyy": "The core message here comes from Aunt May, who believes that everyone deserves a second chance and that people who have means should help others who don't. Also argues that good deeds last forever because they inspire others. There's also a theme about how revenge doesn't solve anything, only creating more bad feelings and regret. MJ's theory is \"expect disappointment, and that way you won't be disappointed,\" but she learns to hope for the best. \"With great power comes great responsibility\" is here too, in a big way.", "Wrong place in scoreboard": "Same score as MASTERPIECE of THE LORD OF THE RINGS ????????Same score as Inception?Higher than Interstellar?Higher than the Matrix 1999???Ridiculous.Spider-Man: no way home doesn't belong here.Convince me im wrong (without prejudice)", "Hi": "Robert Sapolsky is best known for his popular science books, but most notably as the creator of the Stanford course on human evolution. Check it out on YouTube, you won't regret it. And Robert has rather unusual for the layman, scientific views on the nature of evil. He believes that it is necessary to understand the reasons for the anti-social actions of people and fight against them, instead of endlessly condemning and punishing the villains. Evil should not be soaked, but treated! And you won't believe this is exactly what our beloved Spider is doing. Moreover, risking themselves, the lives of their loved ones and the stability of the universe itself. Too serious for youth action? But that's not all! The question of the nature of evil is not the only serious topic touched upon in the tape. This film is about growing up, about what it means to be an adult. That sometimes you need to have the courage to come to terms with what you can't change, and you have to make decisions and take responsibility even when it's absolutely not ready and clean.", "Spide brings villians from the dead so he can heal them!!": "Have no clue how this horrible plot has over an 8 score. Spiderman brings villians from the dead and sympathies with them, they end up backstabbing him and creating more chaos. So the entire movie is built on how woke, guilable Spiderman is.", "Not a Marvel fan": "Not a fan of Marvel movies but they did such a a fantastic job with this. Seeing all the spider dudes and all the villains in such a fantastic story that moved along and didn't slow down was pure enjoyment.", "it's so good": "What cinemas were made for. I wasn't expecting something quite as amazing as this, this was two and a half hours of incredible entertainment, drama, laughs, tears and action galore, there truly was something for everyone here.This movie really has ignited my love for the franchise once again, and I am truly excited for what comes next.Nostalgia, there seems to be a real thirst for it theses days, and there is a lot of it to enjoy here. There are plenty of moments throughout that will have you speechless, they really do break all of the rules here.This is one incredibly good looking movie, dazzling special effects, dizzying action scenes, two and a half hours will literally fly by.", "Best superhero movie of all time": "The amount of times I cried happy tears, AND sad tears! I was screaming and clapping and shouting the entire time. Perfect movie. 10000/10, gave us every thing we needed and more. Would watch a thousand times. Definitely trumps Infinity War and Endgame.", "Fun movie and good use of nostalgia": "Spiderman No Way home is the best movie of all the post Endgame MCU movies, while it does heavily rely on nostalgia of the returning characters I still enjoyed the acting, CGI and fight sequences. It could've been executed better and they wasted Dr Strange, but they did not feel like that big of an issue. Aunt May's death was surprisingly sad even if I did call it way before the scene, but how they linked her character with Green Goblin, while not 10/10, did end up working well. Tom Holland once again was amazing, his acting was fun to watch and really captures what Spiderman is as a character. Finally, how they ended all of the villains stories was satisfactory, a fan of the original movies would love this.", "See Star Wars, fan service CAN be fun, even if the plot still falls a bit flat": "I enjoyed this outing of Spider-Man. I am not a huge fan of the series and never even saw the Andrew Garfield outings, but I really liked the lengths to which the MCU went to get all of the original actors/characters from the prior movies. The concept here is neat, and I am all here for it. I especially liked the little twists like the three spidermans (spidermen?) comparing their webshooters and how their universes differ. Those to me are really cool efforts at world-building that are really effective for fan service (as opposed to the latest star wars trilogy).Overall, the performances were good, but I found Holland's to probably be the weakest. He does a good earnest Peter Parker as always, but he isn't served well by the plot. The plot is also a little too self-aware. Dr Strange is exactly right when he asks Parker why he came straight for a magical cure to the university problem rather than arguing his case. I guess in the end Holland's performance is fine, but he just isn't served well by the contrivances of the plot. It's not good when the characters themselves realize that their plot doesn't make much sense and that they are smarter than it. I think this is a particular downfall after how good Far From Home was in setting up a very cynical yet original storyline.", "Very Cheesy cant believe it made almost 2 Bil": "If you are under 15 im sure you will like it. For older people its cheesy rough acting alot of the time. To each their own but this is more a kids movie then other Marvel stuff.", "Absolutely an insult to cinema industry this movie has in August 2022 8.3": "This is not a movie.This is PURE fanservice, this is something I can't even imagine, trash.The plot of this movie is Spiderman acting like a 11 years old kid with an high doctor strange accomplishing his dreams, that crazy and this is just an excuse to pull out of the cylinder random characters with absolutely no sense to exist (or maybe just to make people into the cinema scream).I think one of the worst if not the worst MCU movie I've ever seen and after this movie I'm completely done with MCU, at least Captain Marvel has a plot and a sense to exist, this movie is an insult.", "WHY?": "What a waste of time. This plot is so shallow that I still don't get why this movie has gotten such a hype (the nostalgia probably). I mean... we all know Spider-Man makes stupid decisions but 'curing' the villains from the other universes? Why would Strange care that his fellow classmates aren't going to MIT? So much that he would create chaos and a breach in the universe to fix it? COME ON.Not to mention that the jokes were written for 5 year olds. \"Peter\" \"yes\" no, Peter Parker\" \" we're Peter Parker\"... cringe. Imma gonna go watch the new Batman cause that's looking like a superhero movie for adults with a brain cell or two.", "Been waiting for this movie since im a kid!": "The best spiderman movie BY FAR!!I never was a fan of Tom holland, but this movie was beyond my expections.Do yourself a favor and if you havent watch it - just do!", "Brilliance!!!!!! A movie that deserves the word perfec": "Wow I loved every part of this movie. This is an example of mixing generations perfectly. Spiderman first came out when I was in my mid teens and I loved it. Then 2 obviously and so on. Then obviously the amazing Spider-Man then Tom Holland's Spider-Man. I never viewed any competition between them I suppose everyone from each generation has their own Spiderman. Now when I heard that do - was coming back from the original Spider-Man 2 I was amazed because he was awesome. Then I found out about the original green goblin from the first and I was like wow really, cool. But then I started to wonder how this was going to be done. Because in movies like this you usually get a ten minute cameo and then the movie moves on. They market the movie with the original but it's just a publicity stunt a way to cash in on nostalgia. So I was a little cautious about seeing this movie because it could have been a disaster in so many ways but it wasn't it was perfect. The older villeins as well as the older Spiderman are absolutely key to the narrative of this movie. This movie is about them and it does it very respectfully but also very thrillingly. Watching this it's almost like three generations haven't passed by at all. They are the same character's they were in the original and they are written in the same and act the same. They all merge together perfectly and work so well it's almost hard to believe. Managing to get three generations of movies together to share the screen and still hold their own in their own right is phenomenal. To the people who made this from the writers to the directors to the star's I say thank you. This movie has now set a bar and it's a high bar. The mixing of generations of hero's and their world's si going to become the next big faze among these types of movies. You have shown them how it should be done. I also want to say that all three of the Spider-Mans got on great but I really enjoyed the chemistry between Tobie McGuire and Andrew Garfield I'd love to see them back again. I also have to acknowledge that this has a lot to hand to the success of Spiderman into the spiderverse thank you for that. This movie is amazing check it out and check out the others it's a brilliant ride.", "Set it and forget it": "Way too much sprinkled with corny jokes (all the jokes were terrible) and revisited Spider-Man PTSD melodrama. This was like a Spider-Man telenovela with all the crappy villains from the crappy Spider-Man multiverse. They waited too long for this one btw, Toby Maguire looks rough.", "Fun but by my no means better than Raimi's Spider-man 2": "I didn't hate it, I enjoyed it but I don't think it's deserving of the praise it's getting.I will say it's the first time Tom Holland's Spider-man has had an arc where the character has seen growth where there was a real threat and it felt like there were consequences for his choices.The only gripe I have it relys too much on the franchise's since past with all the callbacks to dialogue and moments from previous films.The rehabilitation of the villains makes very little sense for Electro, Goblin and Sandman; and Sandman teaming up with villains made no sense either as he was a good guy who had already been rehabilitated and a lot of the characters seemed lost in the shuffle at times.What it made me realise I want a Raimi/Tobey Spider-man 4 and an Amazing Spider-man 3. Garfield is an absolute standout in that film and is the perfect Spider-man, just wasn't given a fair chance with the material he was given.", "Feel Like getting tortured every second.": "The worst acting by all the characters. Worst Avenger movie. I feel it is just waste of money, time and energy.Worst and worst only this I could say.", "Original Spider-Man artist Steve Ditko was born on November 2nd, 1927": "The MCU just keeps on rolling along. They continue to keep their fan base energized and happy. Even the general audience is totally into it too. Kevin Feige and his group are still able to improve upon the already incredible heights that they have already achieved. Their new Disney+ shows have been exactly what they needed to be, fresh and entertaining. Their slate of films since Spiderman: Far From Home (2019), have been pleasantly, surprisingly good.Since the new stuff is humming along, in order to really preserve the franchise for a long time, you need to preserve some of that early history, that got you there. You don't want everybody saying, \"Well, I don't want to watch the old Spiderman movies. They aren't part of the MCU\". No! You want them to watch all your stuff, old and new. Plus, it helps that in the real world, Disney, Sony and Marvel had to come to some kind of a compromise with their IPs, the use of Tom Holland, etc., so why not make that compromise a fitting homage to what Sony started.So, in the MCU universe, why not create this idea of a multi-verse. You can satisfy Sony by bringing back a huge chunk of the elements from their original films and engage with fans across three \"generations\" of different Spiderman franchises, thus making all of them canon with the MCU. A brilliant way to continue generating cash from that amazing IP, known as Spiderman.So, as we left off from Spiderman: Far From Home (2019), we are already treated with a taste of the Sony Spider-verse when J. Jonah Jameson (played by J. K. Simmons, who played JJJ in all three of the Sam Raimi/Tobey McGuire Spiderman films from 2002-2007), shows up to reveal to the world that Peter Parker is Spiderman. Already the audience is thinking multi-verse plot lines, alternate timelines and the possibility of an amazing team up coming. Couple that with some of the events in Avengers: Endgame (2019), the MCU series Loki and everything you have heard in the press and the trailers for Spiderman and Dr. Strange and you are ready for what looks like a multi-verse event coming next. With Spiderman: No Way Home (2021), you will not be disappointed.Now that the world knows who Peter (Tom Holland), is, his life has been a disaster, but, it's not so much his life he is worried about, but the effect it is having on his friends and loved ones. He decides to enlist the aid of Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), to see if he can go back in time to fix his problem before Jameson can announce to the world his secret but, Strange thinks the best way to solve this problem is to use a spell to make people forget he is Spiderman. Unfortunately, Peter's meddling screws up the incantation, which causes a disruption in the multi-verse, sending Spiderman villains from everywhere to Tom Holland's doorstep.That is where the film goes from there. Director, Jon Watts, who has now directed all of the MCU Spiderman films, gives us a great story that answers all the questions, pays homage to the other incarnations and ties up things nice to move the MCU forward. Be ready for plenty of surprises, lots of good funny moments and it even tugs at your emotions at some points in the film. It's a culmination of the last 20 years of Spiderman films and brilliantly collects a cast together that will make you thrilled.8.9 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.", "Simply mindblowing": "The movie was Perfect.One of the best movies I've ever seen.I am Waiting anxiously to watch it again, and I will.It was Definitely worth the wait.", "It's a dream come true for any spiderman fan": "The state of euphoria when I saw the three spidermen in the theater was unbelievable....every single character exiled at their performance .... I am looking forward to see what's next for the future of spiderman ....and we hope to see him in \"black\"", "My theatre audience clapped and cheered many times": "I don't know where to start, after I finished watching it, all I know it feels surreal. Probably, it feels like one of your dream just came true. Generations grew up watching Spider-Man, and this movie is such a perfect ending for a saga (now it could be called a saga). This review isn't supposed to be spoilers, unfortunately, things had to be said.Every returning characters had shown one of their best acting here. Willem Dafoe gives audience goosebumps in every scene he's in. Only by a smirk or an anger on his face, he has done that perfectly. Easily, could call him out as the best villain in Spider-Man. Seeing Andrew Garfield saving \"Gwen Stacy\" was one of the best callbacks. He shows his excitement and grief, and audience could feel it. After all what he went through, I can say I'm very happy seeing him again. Tobey Maguire grows as a wise, and a real friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. He said he was trying to do better, and he proves it.All actor and actress in Tom Holland universe also had done great jobs.For me, personally, I could get Endgame vibes - but this time, I did not expect it could be that big. I am excited for my second, or third time watching it again in theatre.", "Nostalgia and sweetness...": "Best film of 2021. No doubt. Loved the fact that they brought back Andrew and Tobey. Great seeing all the past actors. Ready for Dr. Strange II...on to the multiverse.", "I felt like watching Star Wars The Force Awakens.": "First of all, it is a really good movie and one of the good ones in MCU (however, for me nothing can top Infinity War.. yet.). BUT this movie could have been so much better if there were fewer fan service scenes. It feels like they sacrifice some deeper meaning of reasons everything is happening to make amazing fan service moments. I felt the same thing during Star Wars The Force Awakens.", "A lot of fun and missed opportunities": "No Way Home easily has the biggest crossover spectacle in all standalone Marvel films. Three generations of the Spider Man and many of their foes all in one movie. The premise and the ability to actually bring it together had unlimited potential, but the actual final product mostly underwhelmed. Another kind of film like No Way Home seems highly unlikely making it all that more disappointing.But here is the good. Tom Holland is a talented actor, and that is on full display when his character expresses grief and frustration. Of course, everyone likes the lovable dork Peter Parker can be, but these moments of conflicted feelings are more intimate and genuine, reminding us he is still mostly a kid. Although underutilized, Wilhelm Dafoe has not lost a step reviving his Green Goblin character, effortlessly transitioning between the good and dark side of Norman Osbourne. Nostalgia was the selling point of the film and admittedly it worked for me seeing Dafoe as the classic villain, as well as Tobey Maguire suit up as Spider Man one more time.Unfortunately, Tobey and Andrew Garfield were criminally underutilized from their lazy introductions to the final scene. Besides one moment where the older and wiser Spider Mans consul the younger Peter, Tobey and Andrew were cut outs of their former hero selves. The dialogue many times was so basic and uninspired that I wonder if the writers simply did not know how to handle their characters. Each brought their own unique take to Spider Man, yet they were nurtured for the usual quips and cheap humor Marvel consistently falls back on. Even the fight scenes hardly had them collaborated as one. Just why?Reliving the past for many will be enough to enjoy No Way Home. Despite the plot holes and at times flimsy writing, admittedly the ending was very well done. When Marvel allows itself to focus on the human condition behind the mask of the superhero, it generally excels and provides quality storytelling. No Way Home had those moments, just making me wish for more.", "Decent but overrated movie": "Movie okay, although I don't really like the direction that many of the marvel movies have taken. This one in particular has obvious plot holes and a script that limps, but is saved by good special effects and good actors. Overall it felt like a big box of toys that the director tried to stuff as many characters as possible with to sell more merchandise.I appreciated that in the end Peter decided to abandon his friends and girlfriend so as not to put them in danger anymore. This made it possible to avoid the cliche of memory that comes back despite the spell thanks to the power of love. Too bad that I also suspect that more than a directorial choice was made in order to change the actors in subsequent films.", "Thank you Marvel & Sony": "Thank you to both studios for finally settling your differences and allowing movie to be made that the fans want to see. Thank you also for bringing back all the cast members from the previous movies into this new movie. It's good to see that all the cast members were able to return for this new movie and were able to collaborate and didn't have to fight about egos.", "Throwback-palooza!": "At long last, I've finally seen the latest Spider Man film: No Way Home, Peter Parker's 3rd adventure...and it was the most mind blowing and exciting adventure yet!!After Mysterio successfully exposes Spider Man's identity to the world, never before has Peter Parker had so much chaos, worry, and stress on his plate! Hiding all the time with his friends, attention from the whole planet, and total damnation from the cruel and unfair ranting's of J. Jonah Jameson. And it's about to get 5x's worse! After visiting Doctor Strange, and asking to cast a special spell to erase the memories of all who saw Mysterio's last message, Peter starts to personalize the spell for himself...and it horrifically (but excitingly) backfires, instead bring in tons of new (and familiar) villains from alternate worlds.This is my personal favorite Spider Man film in the MCU, specifically for bringing us back to the first three films from Sam Raimi, and the other two films with Andrew Garfield, and then feeding entirely new life with the Tom Holland Spider Man. All the previous villains from those movies return, with all of their previous actor's in tow...and they all still got it! Later on, the other two Spider Men (Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield) return as well...and they still got it too!! I loved all the chemistry between the Spider's, from comforting \"Peter-Tom\" for his losses, to comparing themselves, and with \"Peter-Tobey\" and \"Peter-Andrew\" telling their stories so far. I'm especially excited to see if we may take a look back into the lives of \"Peter-Tobey\" and \"Peter-Andrew\", see what the future holds for them.Make sure to check out the other Spider Man movies from the past before you see this one. Everything will come together afterwards! All of the webslinger's are back, with an epic team up for the ages!", "Unnecessary forced": "I hate when the whole story and characters are forced to earn a profit and don't necessarily fit it and they start doing anything to extend the story and characters. And there's no good story either and non of the scene made me excited or interested in the movie. It's just another scene.", "Astounding": "The greatest comicbook film yet. Somehow manages to resolve twenty years of movie history, and in a spectacular fashion. Tom Holland shines as the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, and every member of the cast compliments the film perfectly. An immense amount of fun, and emotional to boot.", "Non stop nonsense": "The movie is nonsensical from the get go. A farce without a plot. Instead of storytelling, the creators try to blind us with a parade of characters. A complete waste of time and money. Better to wait for it on Disney+, so you have the power to turn it off!", "Not good enough": "People seem to be very excited about this one, because of the \"reunion\" - that's just fan service, in my opinion.The plot was too simple.The action is good but they made spiderman too weak in a movie about spiderman.I personally don't understand the high ratings for an average movie.", "Good but not 9.1 good": "Lots of buzz over this movie made me want to see it. It's been awhile since real movies were out so it felt good being in the theater. This movie was good on nostalgia but that was the whole premise not just a tongue in cheek moment. It really didn't add anything new. Just a cute and funny twist. I encourage all to see it but to think this movie is better than the Dark Night is crazy. Better than End Game? Hell no.", "This movie will go down in history!!!": "I have never watched a movie that incorporated two decades of Spider-Man movies and combined them into one. If there is another franchise that has done this then please let me know. This movie was absolutely brilliant! Marvel Disney absolutely knows how to please fans! The way No Way Home incorporated all three Spider-Man's, the villains from those previous Spider-Man movies and to use the original actors is absolute perfection. Marvel Disney pulled out all the stops for this and all the actors involved picked up with these characters were they left off in there previous adaptation years later. William Defoe's Green Goblin stood out and he again portrayed his character brilliantly as well as the others. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish and again implementing the Dr. Strange and Venom end credit appearances. Bravo Spider-Man No Way Home. I will see this movie again! I think this may be the best marvel movie yet.", "This is how a franchise gives the fans Young and old what they want!!": "Acting amazing, special effects amazing, humor amazing...what's great is something we haven't seen since Avengers Endgame but not only does Spider-Man No Way Home mention events from previous MCU movies but thanks to Tobey Maguire, William Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Thomas Hayden Church, Rhys Ifans, Jamie Foxx and of course Andrew Garfield also honor and mention every live action Spiderman there's ever been.", "An annoying mess": "I have never watched a more annoying movie in my life. Bad Marvel humor turned up to 11. Unlikeable characters. Forced references: like, ya we get it that's a line from the older movie, no reason to say that line other than force feeding it to being from the original trilogy. They couldn't even get the cameos right. Plus the horrible plot with the most selfish spiderman ever written. Garbage movie.Villains were fun.", "Success! Just wanted a tiny bit more for 10 stars": "I can definitely say I got everything I wanted from this movie. Spiderman has been my favourite superhero since I was a child so I had very high expectations for this movie.I enjoyed every part of it and wanted more! Just felt it needed one more thing to get it to 10/10, but it was still a huge success and can't wait to see where it goes next!", "Enjoyed the multi verse angle but......": "Couldn't help thinking that spiderman was the bad guy in the first half of the movie, he acted like a spoilt brat and wanted everything his own way, is the cause of the bad guys being released and then focuses on saving mass murders over innocents.Found Tom Hollands spiderman very annoying and wanted him to get his cumupance.", "Ok movie": "I expected more from this movie. In the beginning I found it boring since the action took a while to pick up. It was like a puzzle with several pieces, which is ok, but it had so much components to it. At times I enjoyed some of the humor, but I thought in some cases it was a bit too much. I hated the fact they added a section that was unnecessary to insinuate that only black people are poor etc. We all know that every human race have poor, rich, and middle class people. Why do they think it's ok to make fun of the black race and keep sending messages that is not helping with equality. To make it worse they think it will be less painful if it came from a black man. That part was completely unnecessary because the movie in its entirety had nothing to do with that. On the other hand, the one part I really like was the idea of including all spider man (all the Peter Park) of the times. I love the story of coming together to support the 3rd Peter during a difficult time so they can fix the problem. Overall I thought the movie was very long, inconsistent with spider man power, and I've seen better marvel movies. There were lots of great actors, but I expected more from this movie.", "The humor and story don't work for me": "Doesn't do the Spider-man genre justice. The Spider-man genre has always had small amounts of interjected humor, but this movie goes way too far with the amount and placement. It marginalizes the movie. But that aside, I was fairly unimpressed with the story. Suspension of disbelief is always needed for superhero movies, but this story does whatever it wants to advance the storyline.", "Spoiler free 10/10 movie": "It's pretty difficult to write anything here without spoilers, but it is a fantastic movie, for older and younger Spidey fans, the pacing was good, the humour was well placed, the action looked fantastic, the CGI didn't look out of place, it really added to the world of the MCU but still felt like a standalone story, where so many other marvel movies didn't. There were 1 or 2 issues for me but I can't really divulge that without spoilers, but all in all it was a fantastic movie 10/10.", "Good but not the best.": "3 Spiderman in the price of 1?! Fantastic! Movie seems to lack the same charm or feel for some reason but still a decent outing in the franchise. Would have loved to see some more awe-inspiring action.Doc is the best! Looking forward to the multiverse of madness!!", "The Best MCU Movie": "This was amazing, everything was perfect. Great surprises, twists, emotional scenes, amazing acting, fantastic direction and script. Tom Holland was an highlight throughout the film, his performance was the best he's given till now. Ending was emotional but brilliant. All the six movies, from Civil War to No Way Home have been an Origin Story for Tom's Peter and I have a feeling the next Spider Man film is gonna be amazing.", "TOM HOLLAND IS SPIDERMAN - FOR REAL": "I have read over 10,000 comic books among other books.

But you should go watch it!", "Ambitious and emotional ending to the \"home\" trilogy": "The movie has a very strong first act that felt grounded and after that the movie sets up \"the conflict\" with ambitious creative choices that not always worked. Because of the ambiton of the movie it has to many beloved characters with extremely short screen time that made them feel cheesy.With all that in mind the movie has strong emotional punches and great action and properly is the best movie in the trilogy and one of the best spiderman movies.", "Awesome packed film": "Such a good story from start to finish was hooked. Tom Holland is such a good spiderman plays both parts perfectly Peter Parker and Spiderman. Many funny parts few emotions parts amazing!", "Damn I am gonna get dislikes on this review": "MINOR SPOILER WARNING (but only stuff from the trailers)Now before you dislike this review THIS IS JUST AN OPINION NOT FACT. Spider-Man fans are so annoying sometimes. What really impressed me with this movie was that it managed to cover a lot of ground without being a giant mess. There are so many characters in this movie and it still manages to feel focused on Peter and his arc while giving the other characters things to do. The acting is also phenomenal, Zendaya, Alfred Molina and Jacob Batalon all do a good job with the material they are given. Tom Holland is fantastic and this might be his best performance as Peter Parker yet. However the best part of the movie has to be William Dafoe who absolutely kills it with every moment he is given. I also think that this movie really gets Peter Parker right. His characterization is really great and he feels like Spider-Man more so than ever. The emotional stakes feel way heavier than any of the other movies. Also I really really loved the ending and to me it was the best way this movie could have ended.Now as you can tell I like a lot of things in this movie but there was a lot of stuff I didn't like as well. Firstly I really didn't find this movie to be funny. I think that the Tom Holland movies have become less funny with each installment. Homecoming was the funniest movie in my opinion due to how genuine it felt. Far From Home had it fair few of funny moments but the humor felt a bit forced at times. However this movie just didn't hit me with the jokes. There were many moments where I was questioning what was funny in the scene and the audience didn't seem to know either as there were no laughs during many of the jokes. Also because of the returning characters you get call back jokes and they are not that great. The memes will be good tho. The only really funny moment was a musical cue but I'm not sure if it was supposed to be funny or not. Some of the special affects were pretty bad. Most of it looked fine but there were some moments especially near the end were it looked like a PS2 video game and it really took me out of the movie. There was a scene that reminded me of those kids YouTube videos with superheroes in them. There was also one returning character whom was so garbage that I seriously wondered why they even bothered with including him in the movie. A lot of the heavy moment in this movie especially one in the final battle felt really cheap and predictable to me.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an impressive movie for sure with all of the characters it has and how well it manages to make it all work. Sadly the movie falls short in a lot of areas were it's predecessors succeeded.", "Nice to watch it once": "This was just fan service. It does not bring anything into the MCU. Lazy writing that makes no sense.I honestly enjoyed seeing the 3 Spider-Man together but the storyline is far from good and the other Spider-Man are \"useless\" in this movie.The character of Tom holland really is simple and does not develop the character like in other movies.The end costume also looks bad for me.", "PHENOMENAL! Easily the best Spider-Man Movie": "This movie had many characters introduced and it was a fun movie for any Spider-Man fan! It was a great way to end the trilogy that is Peters Origin. From the beginning everything was amazing. From Matt Murdock and then all the call backs to previous Spider-Man movies and to Tobey and Andrew reappearing! The best movie I have ever watched. If I could, I would give it an 11/10.", "Extremely Good But Never Great": "Hello From Here - What Marvel deliver is a solid third outing of the Spider-Man saga. Everything including the kitchen sink is thrown at this story. With all that said, No Way Home still misses that polish and shine to make it feel as special as previous installments.The big issue is the CGI, it's extremely noticeable, not enhancing the action but taking it over. Even the simplist scenes that should look natural have this over processed CGI effect. With years and years of beautiful realism in Marvel movies, superheroes brought to life in our world on screen, our cities, our landmarks, this world looks fake with environments more akin to a well shot video game.The performances save the day here, the on screen chemistry absolutely shines. What you see between characters feels genuine and heartfelt bringing real sincerity to the storytelling. Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Holland) and MJ (Zandaya) are the best version I've seen with Zandaya finally fitting the character that has felt miss cast in every other movie. There are still moments that are at odds. After all that's happened to Holland's Spider-Man during many films, he starts off here as childish, immature, coming across as still being an innocent and nieve young teen. To then have some cuts and bruises, turning to violence and vengeance did not work. Holland did not pull this character change off, he simply was not dark enough.There is a lot to enjoy here with an amazing story being told by the actors. The look and feel is not at the high standard we expect from Marvel, it's not the best but it's still very good!", "Tom Holland Really Is Spider-Man": "It is very hard to write a review for this one that does not contain spoilers so I will simply say this is an ambitious follow up to Spider Man: Far From Home. It is exciting and heartfelt and funny at times. Tom Holland really is Spider-Man as far as I am concerned and I grew up on Toby Maguire. The visual effects are great. The characters and acting are what you expect from these films. It is hard to continue the progression of stories without becoming simply formulaic and I think this film achieves that success. It breaks new ground and Still retains what people have come to adore about the Genre. If you have kids, or are a kid, I would actually add one star. You could enjoy this without seeing the predecessor.", "You will love it": "Everyone needs to watch this film. It's so good, well executed.. Some bits a bit too cheesy but it's a super hero film after all. But still very enjoyable.", "This is not just \"another Spider-Man movie\" This is the Best Spider-Man Movie.": "I had been spoiled prior to watching the Movie, but I still enjoyed it nonetheless.The movie starts with a scenario we haven't seen before in a Spider-Man movie. We see the struggle of Peter Parker when his Identity is revealed to the world, especially after Mysterio's last trick, which made it look like Peter killed him. Peter is not the only one getting hurt by this, but his loved ones aswell. This contributes to the bitter (I would argue there's no sweetness) in that ending. I sure hope these beloved characters return for future movies, I'm talking of course about MJ and Ned.", "Greatest Spider-Man movie ever.": "Tom Holland was absolutely amazing in this film. William Dafoe didn't not disappoint again he is the greatest villain of all time. I have never been to a movie with so many cheers and excitement.", "SPIDEY IS BACK": "First of all this is the best iteration of Tom's Spider-Man I really enjoyed this film and I highly recommend it the villains were done well to some degree and everyone involved did their thing.", "Fan Service Done Well": "This is one giant nostalgia hit injected straight into your eyes thanks to Sony.They knew what they were doing here.They knew how many of us loved the original Spider-Man films and they knew how many people love the new Spider-Man.They also knew that those fans are somewhat divided.How do we get the old fans to like our newer and worker series? We do what we did with Star Wars... We bring back the most loved characters.And it worked!The script isn't out of this world good but it's enough. Willem Dafoe does a tremendous job reprising his role of The Green Goblin and is the most outstanding of the older villains. Jamie Foxx's Electro wasn't all that. The character was boring in The Amazing Spider-Man and he didn't really deliver here either.The combat was decent, the surprises were done really well and the story wasn't completely awful.Mary Jane still sucks but her performance was the best she has done. Basically, she wasn't an insufferable, woke fun sucker for the first time ever.Still wouldn't mind if she got the old Gwen Stacey treatment, if you know what I mean.Aunt May is also boring and beyond dumb in this film. I won't spoil anything. All I'll say is, lives would have been saved if we didn't listen to her, yet the movie acts as if she's so profound and good.Overall, this is the best a Marvel film can do and the first time I've rated any of them above 5 stars. Don't go in thinking this will be phenomenal. Unless you're a a massive Marvel fan. In which case, this will be the best film you'll ever see according to you.", "Good as usual": "After many low level of movies from Marvel finally some thing came which really maintain legusy of Marvel. Wonderfull movie, I had never thought that I will be able to see something such thrilling after Avengers endgame and infinity war.", "Awesome movie, top movie of marvel": "Great movie, best acting , emotional scenes are very heart touching and awesome,VFX was great visaul treat in theatres. Great movie, best acting , emotional scenes are very heart touching and awesome,VFX was great visaul treat in theatres.", "I've missed having this much fun with movies...": "71/100The first half of Spider-Man: No way home seems hopeless, exactly like almost every other marvel movie we've seen: a bad screenplay with painfully unfunny jokes that feel like they only serve the purpose of extending the movie's own runtime to 2 1/2 hours. It almost feels like it relies on the movie's other aspects -the daring cinematography, the innovative editing and directing for marvel's own standards and a surprisingly good score attributed to Giacchino- to reduce the amount of people gazing towards what's lacking. For a hot minute, I thought those were the movie's true colors. That is, of course, until the movie itself marks a half of its second act and plants the foundation for the third one.The actors, despite a lack of material, deliver surprising and attentive performances which, fortunately enough, help give Holland's character a good-enough arc if we forget the other two movie's existence. However, it is necessary to point allude to the fact that some of the character's motivations may come across as contradictory from what has been seen from them in the past, leaving me with a picture of uncertainty as to what the writers actually had in their hands.Overall, just like any other Marvel movie, we can attribute Spider-Man: No Way Home a good entertainment value, one of which I, being honest entirely, had missed from movies and only recieved fully until now...", "As good as end game": "End game was not as good as infinity war and somehow still better. It also wasn't as good as guardians or Ragnarok, but still better. Better only in the emotional journey of seeing the completion of years of anticipation. I could suspend my disbelief because I'm here for the magic and I'm here for the love and I'm here for a finale. Spider man was the same, and it didn't have to be. Sure they knew they'd make their money back, and yet these big companies rarely decide to put everything they have into their films. Spider-Man put everything it had into this film. The ending is great, but not what you wanted, which makes it even better. In the end, this film is about Spider-Man, and we get to finally see who he is.", "Good .": "What a ride , may be one of the best comic movies of all time , not a fan of Holland, even though I skipped the first 2 , it's a blast by benedict , Tobey and Garfield , really a good watch , kids will enjoy it and for fans it rocks , the best part is not the movie but the 2nd end credits , #doctorstrange dark sweeps into MCU.#spidermannowayhome #benedictcumberbatch #garfield .P.s I feel Tom looks very nascent against tobey and Garfield even with his fancy tech.Defnetly a therater watch , 3d is not that of an over kill this , it actualled made sence at places.\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b508/10.", "Bait and switch": "This is by far the darkest of the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies, and for the first time, I can believe that Holland is Spider-Man and not a boy stuck in the shadow of Tony Stark.However, when the movie ended, I realized that this movie existed only to bring together all Spider-Man fans behind Holland. The cameos of Garfield and Tobey are pretty interesting, but by the end of the movie I couldn't help but feel that they were only there to endorse Tom Holland as the new Spider-Man. All of their villains are \"cured\", and the MCU essentially says \"now that we got those old franchises permanently out of the way, people will stop whining for a new installment in the Raimiverse or Amazing Spider-Man. See, Tom even made his own suit and is going to live alone paycheck to paycheck.\"As a fan of the Raimi films, I felt tricked. Dangle some of Tobey's villains only to \"cure\" all of them, kick him back to his universe and force Tom as the one and only Spider-Man.Surely there was a better way to have Tom shed his reputation in the eyes of many as Iron Boy Jr without cash grab cameos.If you were like me after leaving the film and felt cheated, like you watched cash grab cameos also designed to rally you behind Tom Holland, then hopefully my review helps you better put words to your feelings about the movie.I will say, the ending with Tom making his own suit and swinging off into the New York night was amazing for sure, probably the best scene of the movie.", "With Great Power comes.. overhype": "Overall entertaining movie but way too overhyped IMHO. I was expecting so much more from this. All the 'jokes' they made were so cringe and stupid that max only one in ten laughed forcibly. Too much crying and nonsense - they should have cut atleast 30min out of this movie. Despite everything, acting was good in general and it was pleasure to see old pals.", "True masterpiece": "This is hands down the best spider man film ever made. Especially the comeback of tobey maguire was just fabulous . Salute to the director Jon Watts for giving such a masterpiece.", "Criminally overrated": "The fact that this movie is rated #9 on IMDB's top 250 list is criminal and hugely disrespectful to the entire list. The only thing the movie did was put everyone in a nostalgia coma. Other than that, nothing really made sense. But I guess that it is enough nowadays. Although it was a good break from life, it should be treated as the movie it is, and not the movie people so desperately wanted it to be.", "Entertaining. But...": "This is my first IMDB review in like 10 years. Huge MCU fan. Entertaining movie but I have serious reservations about the way things are going.I have never been a fan of timeline manipulation, retconning, or other tricks (e.g. \"it was all a dream\") (Ironically, Star Wars needs retconning to get back to the \"real\" lore. But I digress).If Tobey Maguire is not in the Tom Holland universe, that means Spiderman I,II,III were not \"my universe\" or that the Avengers are not in \"my universe\". I don't like it. I need to feel that this is my space/time. I want continuity so I can invest.Apparently, this wasn't like James Bond where we simply suspend belief that the same dude gets younger after a few years. But, it is our world, the real world, with a fiction on top of it. I don't want to watch a James Bond movie if it's not even supposed to be my world. Don't you guys feel there is a difference between fiction on our planet, and \"this isn't even your planet\"?If you simply can rewrite everything (looking at you X-Men) each time you want to have a new plot line, then why should invest in the meta, the backstory, the history, the lore, etc.? I loved the build to End Game. Now it feels like one-offs with random continuity, and no \"truth\".Tom Holland is simply fabulous. And great fan service with Tobey and Andrew, and all the baddies. Totally appreciated the \"that's what we do\" which smelled like \"I could do this all day\", but I am sucker for heroism and altruism.", "Poorly written as usual": "Why is it so hard to actually write a decent script?This nonsense makes NO SENSE. They make spiderman the dumbest person on the planet but at the same time he has the brains to go to MIT?", "Is It the best Spidy movie?": "Spider-Man No Way Home is a great entertainment movie that brings sadness, nostalgia and lots of fun.The film seems to be divided into two parts, with the first very comical phase which has the task of deepening the psychology of the three main characters and of resuming what was \"sown\" in Far From Home. A positive aspect is that the film takes longer to start, in order to solve and explain the problems of the previous film well.While in the second part the film speeds up showing all its twists and the potential that fans were waiting for.But this is where the first problems begin from my point of view. The plot begins to stagger a bit, in fact a second vision will perhaps serve to fully understand the motivations.The directing, which had culminated in Spider-Man Far Frome Home, especially gets worse in fights where the action is difficult to understand. Except (scene seen in the trailer) the fight on the bridge between Peter and Octopus, in which Wats managed to make the character of Molina created by Sam Raimi believable.Another problem is the comic dialogues set in wrong situations, which for example break up the epic moments of the film.The special effects have deteriorated compared to those of Far Frome Home, as well as the soundtrack, which is no longer so present in the scene.So in my opinion there has been some steps forward compared to previous triology films, but also many steps backwards that I never expected.The question I ask is: Did we feel that much need to see characters from old films?My answer is no ... I would have preferred to see more original characters and story.In the end, No Way Home is a film that is superior to Far From Home but that does not reach the levels of Homecoming.A film that could have had more potential but it satisfied me.", "By far the best Spiderman movie!!": "The movie starts from where it was left on Far From Home.The beginning is the most exciting part.Middle felt like director's cut (lame meme jokes and long dialogues was avoidable)Good dual video calling scene.The usual side of spiderman, lovable and reasonable.You would love it for sure.Direction, Screenplay, Storyboarding and graphics are worth praising.Thoughts:\nThey (Marvel) are way ahead in terms of content execution (in phases) from their peers and the way they can introduce multiple casts is hats off.After a long time went for the first day show,\nThis will be the covid breakers in terms of revenue.Marvel has already hooked us in their storyline,\nCan't wait to see Dr. Strange for the madness of multiverse.", "What a mess...": "I don't even want to waste anymore time on writing this review that's how bad it was, but I need to write at least 150 characters. Title says it all. For the love of your brain don't watch it!", "Well thought out": "This is was such a fun movie. You can tell that Sony and Disney really worked together and planned this out for the immediate and long term future of their franchises.", "Cheesy and woke rubbish": "I was dragged along to watch this film with my family and what a load of absolute rubbish it was. Why is every film now either woke or a fantasy film? In the days before special effects took over they were forced to make decent live action films. Classics. How many great films aren't getting made because everything now is about men who turn into spiders and fly around the place. Absolute horse manure this was. Benedict Cumberbatch looks like he's just there for his paychecks.It's also very convenient that Dr Strange has this ridiculous power where any person can be teleported from one place to another. Makes working out the plot easy I guess, if something doesn't fit right they can simply transport a character somewhere else. These are truly films for children and people who have all the intellectual depth of a puddle. What a shame these films are taking over now.", "Could watch again for the notalgia": "The plot was solid, but I think the whole reason why everything happened was weak. Although, movie does justify why the main character caused everything in the first place. A lot of jokes, but I think it hurts the movie since I felt could not take it very seriously, specially in the sad scenes. Maybe if the movie's comedy had been tone down a little bit, that would have helped. A lot of fan service which was nice, but you probably will need to see all other Spiderman movies to fully enjoy which is what? Six? Eight (if do watch the MCU spiderman movies)? Maybe more if you consider Avengers. The acting was nice and relatable. It is amazing there such a big casts in this movie.This Spiderman movie was solid, I would watch it again for the nostalgia of seeing my friendly neighbor Spiderboy.", "Decent, just 1 thing that annoyed me": "A decent movie overall, but I wouldn't call this an exceptional movie.The whole world knows Spiderman's identity and this makes Peter's life basically impossible.Therefore he goes to Dr Strange to make everyone forget about him...but Peter messes this up with changing his mind over and over, thereby creating a botched spell, inviting the baddies from the older spiderman movies into this universe.And this is where things go wrong (ofcourse).Spiderman, pushed by his aunt May, wants to 'save' these villains instead of just sending them back to their universe where they were dead, killed by the other Spidermans accidently or not.I find this notion such a weak and out of character reaction from a superhero who fought Thanos and is even partially responsible for Mysterio's death or ruining the lives of the Vulture's family (where he had a serious crush on the daughter).Where were the naive thoughts of \"I can help them become good\".We have a superhero here that knows already what happens if you let villains go unchecked and thinking you can save these villains is a very naieve and totally bonkers idea.Would you give these villains a second chance at live? Hell no.And then saying it is not Peter's fault on what happened?Ofcourse it is his fault.The speech with great power comes great responsibility puts all the responsibility of what happened at Peter's feet....he knew these were villains.Bad people that killed and were killed by Spiderman and still he felt he could do better by saving them with the consequence of Aunt May being killed by one of them.I hope he has is lesson learned now.", "Spider-Man: Fan Service Only": "So someone who really liked 'Into the Spider-Verse' ironically decided to pull a Disney and do a live action version of it.Just like the Avengers movies this is crammed full of just about everything from ideas and plot points to characters and cameos - and throws the: \"who's is your favourite Spidey\" question into the ring by shoehorning them all in together for the final act.If this movie was a checklist of nostagia and fan service then the big scores would make sense - but most of the characters have no place or point in the film and the qualities they brought in their original portrayals (incl. Doctor Strange) are watered down or dismissed to fit with the bumbling narrative of this CGI empty vessel.With Big MCU Movies Comes Great Disappointment.", "Best Spidy Film So Far!": "This movie exceeded my expectations by a mile.There was so much hype around it that I thought it may struggle to live up to it but wasn't I wrong!Movie was everything I hoped for and more. Absolute fan service to not just Spider-man fans but to superhero fans. Cannot wait to see where the story goes next!", "Very boring story": "The movie itself looks good.But this picture is only created because old favorite characters such as Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland appear, plus all the villains are played by the same actors as before. This misleads the viewer, you rejoice at the fact that you see all these wonderful actors, and also all together, this is a \"surprise\", but the plot itself is sucked out of your finger, after the decline of \"euphoria\" from the appearance of all these actors in one film it became boring to watch, there was a feeling that I was deceived, because there really is no plot.", "Soulless, Vacuous Garbage!": "Given the second film I should've known better, but I wanted to give No Way Home a chance in the hope Dr. Strange could save it from the mediocrity that was Jake Gyllenhall as Mysterio. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.This film is so inconsistent with its tone it's honestly laughable. Peter Parker botches Strange's spell multiple times whilst he's mid-casting it even though Strange tells him not to? Since when did Strange become stupider than a 17 year old kid.Spider-Man then defeats Strange in his own dimension using geometry based maths... Um, what?Aunt May dies and then in the lab MJ asks Peter if he's okay and his immediate response is \"Yeah, I'm fine.\" Um, what? Aside from the tonal inconsistencies it really is nothing more than yet another Marvel/Disney CGI borefest; where nothing that happens involving any of the villains is remotely believable as far as suspension of disbelief goes.All the incidental characters just behave and act as though everything's normal and fine and they haven't just been through or seen the most traumatic experience of their entire lives. It's all so utterly fake and inconsequential.Unfortunately, this is just like every other copy and paste Marvel movie that fails to engage its audience with characters that actually have emotional depth. As it stands, No Way Home is a soulless, vacuous slog that entertains to some degree, but doesn't show anything that comes close to being meaningful.", "The best of Tom Holland": "We are looking at one of the best superhero movies ever made, we are lucky to live in this timeline.The only thing that is missing is the soundtrack as it has not been used 100% in my simple opinion.", "Great but not well written": "SPOILERS AHEAD!It's great Tobey and Andrew made a return and overall it was a great movie but not a 9/10 worth. People are rating it that high just because of tobey and Andrew. The story wasn't that great and just not well written.", "Best movie I've seen in years": "Writing, acting, CGI, everything is just perfect! The relatively simple storyline makes it very easy to follow and is executed so well by all of the actors. A great movie for everyone who loves movies, and a true masterpiece for the Spidey-fans.", "From start to finish. A masterpiece.": "I was anticipating this movie ever since it's announcement and I can tell you assuredly that it meets all your expectations, in fact it beats many of them. The acting and portrayals of all the characters are fantastic, with the return of classic villains not just as cameo roles but as significant pieces of the plot - Willem Dafoe in particular giving an outstanding performance of the iconic character once again. All these characters feature their own significant developments throughout the film in such a brilliant way - bringing the past collective movies together in one explosive conclusion.", "Good, but way over rated.": "A multi universe where the the two other spider man and villains come back. The action is nice, but not that stunning.The concept is unique and cool, and I guess that's why everyone is hyped. But everyone rating it a 10? Cmon...\nHaving a higher score than Gladiator? Braveheart? The green mile? The green book?Is every 12 year old creating an account and rating this movie this a 9 or 10? Cmon guys!?!?Let's get realistic here.", "Too many mistakes": "If you're a person who enjoys an action movie and can also follow a plot, this movie is Not for you.Women have to wash super suits, there is no apparent reason a cure is made but it doesn't work only to be made again and works like a charm. Major characters appear only to say a word or two. Bad guys are apparently easy to fix.", "Sony & Disney/Marvel Finally working together!": "This new Spiderman was amazing. I saw that Sony & Marvel actually made an attempt to finally make sense of all the Spiderman movies put out so far. Great job you guys, finally fixing the plot.", "Fans only": "This one is big sloppy kiss with tongue to all the diehard fans of the various iterations of SM, and everyone else can go fox themselves (to paraphrase Dr Strange's mug.)The many wonderful actors give it their all, but they are wasted in a film that is too long and too confusing, and while there are a few tidbits which will raise a smile, it's just too much. Half the number of villains and superheroes would have made it twice as much fun.I'm prepared to be in a massive minority in this, however.", "WOOOOOOW": "This movie was outstanding...started strong, ended stronger. Connection between Tom and Zendeya is remarkable, you feel the love. For me Villains steal the show. What a great movie.", "Nostalgia Sells!": "Remove the Nostalgia of having Tobey and Andrew as Spiderman, you'll have nothing. Doctor Strange and Peter Parker comes across as idiots.And man, exposition, exposition, exposition! Whatever happened to \"show not tell\"?", "ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE": "This is a great film from start to finish...

This movie is a masterpiece. The character that I loved the most was Green Goblin because he was so scary in this movie. Also I loved to see back Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield back, that was the most exciting thing that I want it to see in the movie but William Dafoe was the best in this movie by far.", "It was a pretty good movie.": "I liked it, based on the morality,multi-verse and stuff, the amount of special effects is just...way bigger than i thought it will be, but after all it's a superhero movie, but still the lack of villains that came when they messed up the multi-verse,i'm talking about Dr. Otto, Lizzard, Max Sandman and The Green Goblin like come on where's Venom?.In my opinion if Venom appeared in this movie played by Tom Hardy I'd rate this a 10/10.", "How did they pull this off": "I have a 14 year old son who understands the Amazing Spider-Man, was too young to really understand the first cinematic Spider-Man but he completely grew up with this spider man and he's said this film was better than Endgame and Infinity War.

And then... spiderman decides to save the fate of those villains and traps Dr. Strange in the mirror dimension. You must be kidding me!A much better plot could have started with a much powerful villain. Who makes Dr. Strange's to do his magic spell and messes it up, and not only traps Dr. Strange in a x-dimension but also brings in the villains from other dimensions. With the death of each of these villains Dr. Strange's powers must weaken leading into his possible death but then comes our spiderman to rescue.And lastly, there should have been a deep emotional bond between Dr. Strange and spydi from the beginning. The End Game could be the base of it.", "Thrice Thrilling": "When I first saw Matt as peter's lawyer, I knew that this would be a great thrilling movie. The comedy, the drama and the level of acting of tom and zendaya were excellent. The entrance of Andrew Garfield and Toby Were just ... Wooooow , made the theater hall clap crazy. The final action scene was outstanding. Gonna watch it again for sure.. Thank you Marvel and Sony for this Entertaining the Fans .", "The most romantic love letter for spider-man": "From beginning to end this is a movie full of fan service but absolutely not in a bad way, from the begging we can see this version of Peter in a new way, we explore what's beyond him trying to fill Tony Stark's shoes, he is not even mentioned in the movie until the very end. Which is a good thing as now we can enjoy spider-man as he was supposed to be, a lonely superhero, although he is helped by his friends but not by any other superheroes. I enjoy how the movie takes the necessary time to explore the relationship between Zendaya's M. J and Tom's Peter, I repeat, it only takes the time that is necessary, it doesn't become a main thing in the plot but it does contribute to it. On the other side, Ned is hilarious and adds to the plot also what's necessary for it to work in a proper way.I really enjoyed how the legal situation regarding spider-man's identity was not an actual issue in the movie, but i feel glad we could see how that was handled as it worked as the main cliffhanger on the last movie. Talking about this, we had Daredevil's cameo which I appreciate very much. On the other side, the trailer wanted to make it seem as if Stephen Strange didn't actually care about doing a spell that could be tampering with time and space, in the movie he actually cares and proposes some other solutions for Peter, that in the end help him solve his problem.Something that I personally do not like about Tom Holland's Spider-man is the fact that he is a little boy, they make everything that happens as his fault and I thought that was ok for the first movie, we could see character development and the impact between his relationship with Tony, however they repeated it in Far from home, which I guess it's ok but this time I just ended up not liking him, well at least until the whole erased memory thing, after that I felt really empathic with him and his situation.Now can we talk about the 3 spider-mans??!?? Ofc this is something a lot of people thought about, something so big that when the rumor first came out it made absolutely everyone excited... This movie is symbolic, as Tom Holland states, this movie is the combination of three different generations that went to the movies to watch a spider-man movie. Something that I don't believe has happened with any other superhero. Every one that was born between the 1980's up to the late 2000's has had this experience and now we all come together as one. In my personal experience, I grew up going to watch Andrew's as a little kid and now that I am grown up and look back, I can not only see how much he has grown but also how I have grown since then, seeing Andrew and Tobey again in the big screen is something that I feel blessed about.Talking about the fan service, we can see the recreation of several memes; the \"I'm somewhat of a genius myself\" and the three spider-mans pointing at each other, also I know that we, the fans, would've been really happy if we only saw the characters fight against the villains but they actually gave us the extra; they working as a team and hanging out, just talking about the web shooters, which I know that we all thought about it but didn't actually think it was going to be in the movie, also I completely loved the redemption of Andrew actually saving M. J. and all the nostalgia it means. And the answer to the questions \"How would Tobey and Andrew react to the idea of the avengers?\" Or \"How would Norman Osborn react to the fact that there is no Oscorp\". Regarding May's death (which broke my heart) on the first 30 seconds I was kind of mad because they had killed her, however I believe that it was the greatest impact that we needed to finally focus on Peter as a potentially grown man, and ofc, this worked as a link to the other spider-mans, the \"leap of faith\" and I loved that they worked it in almost the exact same was as in \"into the spider-verse\" the \"we're the only ones that know exactly how you feel\".The villains themselves were beautiful but the prize goes to Willem Dafoe, he nailed it yet again with the green goblin and made me hate him but also feel a bit of empathy towards him. In conclusion, I love the final evolution yet of Peter, we will now see him as a lonely spider-man with a really cool homemade suit and no Mr. Stark or aunt May to go to which, even if it sad, I believe its something that the character needed to reach the level of maturity, also, no avengers to turn to as they all forgot their memories with him. Basically if you read this even with the spoiler signs and haven't seen it yet; make yourself a favor and go watch it, if you were a kid or a teen at the time any of the Spider-Man's saga came out then just watch it, for old time's sake... you're literally being a part of a historic cinematographic event and the begging of a new era of blockbuster movies. Even if you don't enjoy the story, marvel never fails at making visual masterpieces. So I give it a 10/10. Hopefully there are not any spelling mistakes or poor redactions.", "Overrated much?": "Not sure what's wrong with people, yet another boring action movie with dull dialogue and a lazy storyline. The movie relies heavily on its nostalgia factor. Don't waste your time.", "Oh, folks! Folks! We have a heartbreaker.": "This movie was great and all, but the second half past the demise of Aunt May was just too upsetting, considering that Spider-Man goes into a BAAD funk wanting to murder Green Goblin because the Green Goblin killed Aunt May! And everybody forgetting who Peter Parker is...this held my heart gently and squashed it like an apple! Nonetheless, kudos to Marvel for making those great movies. Just be prepared for those intense scenes.", "Mixed feelings": "I had a hard time watching spidermen no way home. First i want to tell my \"history\" with the Spider-Man franchise. I grew up with Andrew Garfields Amazing Spider-Man. I liked them as a kid but i was never a huge Spider-Man fan. I watched every Tobey Maguire Movie with my father and enjoyed them to. I liked Tom Hollands Spider-Man as well especially in \"Far from Home\". I saw the trailers and i was scared that it would be to much. And i was right. The film is pure fan-service. The film felt as if marvel made an opinion poll and made everything the fans told them to do. The basic idea of the film is weird. Characters as Dr. Strange , which is my Marvel Favorit hero, behaved out of character and stupid. I didn't enjoy the first half of the film at all. Everything seemed so forced and rushed. Then after the big reveal that every Spiderman was in the film I enjoyed the film for a bit, even if it was to much. I didn't enjoy the end. Again everything felt stupid, rushed and way to easy. Most of the villains were boring and had absolutely no impact on the movie. I want to tell you to the thing that annoyed me most: The \"Ned is a Magician\" plot. I think that it is unnecessary and stupid. Why and how does he learn this so fast? Why was it never even teased in other movies? But it was not all bad. I felt entertained but that is just not enough for me. There where also a few outstanding aspects. I really liked William Dafoe's acting. The special effects where amazing. And the scene where Andrew saves MJ and has tears in his eyes was outstanding. All in all it is worth watching if you are a marvel fan and you just want to be entertained but i wouldn't watch it again, hence the 5/10 from my humble self.", "A very good movie !": "This movie is very entertaining and a lot of fun ! It is very close to what an anime version of it would have been and that makes it even more interesting. It really feels like it was made for kids just like DC's Shazam !", "AMAZING VISUAL EFFECTS": "Like any other MCU films, this one boasted of outstanding visual effects and cinematography. The only issue I had was the storyline. It was confusing at times and the surprise appearance of two former Spider-Man actors just didn't have that much of an impact. For me, although it captured the nostalgia it was aiming for, it was almost anticlimactic.", "My biggest dream come true": "In order to write everything I feel in my heart I have to use spoilers, there's no other way for me to talk about this movie.I can't remember a lot of things from when I was young but one thing I can remember is the first time I watched spiderman. It was the first movie of Tobey Maguire and the second it finished I immediately wanted to watch it again.That became my life for a couple of years, as I literally watched the Tobey Maguire spiderman movies daily for years straight. I think it's pretty clear who my favorite spidey is now and what the original trilogy means to me. I love all three of them with my heart and they're a huge part of my life.About a year ago I started following leaks for NWH as I was to excited about the prospect of seeing Tobey once on the big screen. Was my biggest dream in life gonna become a reality? Am I finally gonna see the character that means the world to me in the cinema?The answer with NWH is yes and not only that, it brought back the villians I loved and made them even better. The villians and spidermen were there for a reason and not just pure fan service. Whenever I watch the original trilogy It feels magical. No other movie has ever captured that magic for me and I never thought another movie would be able to do it. Then NWH comes around and shows me the villians I love again and yes, Tobey.I went absolutely crazy and I'm still in disbelief this has become a reality. I'm so thankful to the people that made this happen and I just wanna give them all such a big hug. This movie has changed my life and I'm eternally grateful.I'd like to complement Jon Watts as I truly think he did a remarkable job, his shots are very beautiful in this movie and the directing is a huge step up from the previous movies IMO. The character arcs are sooo good in this movie. This movie made me love Tom Holland whereas before I didn't really care about him. Aunt may man....... damn that death scene was powerful. The way she dropped the responsibility line levels that of the original Uncle Ben.I loved everything about this movie and seeing the 3 spidermen together and especially Tobey on the big screen, it means the world to me. I've seen this movie twice already and i'm going again sunday, I literally can't wait. I never thought I'd say this but, for me, this movie is on the same level as the OG trilogy and it's the only one to be that. No other movie will ever accomplish that unless Tobey comes back for his own spiderman 4.This wasn't really a review I know, I just had to write somewhere how this movie made me feel and I just felt this place was the right one to do so. I don't know if anyone is actually gonna read this far but if you do, i'm sure you love this movie as much as me. Let's be grateful and thankful for this legendary movie. I gave the movie a 10 but in reality it's a 100/10 for me. I can't judge it, it's just magical like the original trilogy. I know spiderman 3 for example is flawed but I'm just way too biased and I am too for this movie. Thank you.", "Best spideiboi-movie ever": "I wake up think spidey yes!As small child thought spidey cool big webs catch bas guysAfter see watch on the movie no way home I go spidey! YES!

Tom Holland, Zendaya, Jacob Batalon, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jon Favreau, Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Marisa Tomei & of course J. K.

I hate the fact that each time it's more of a child movie. Now don't get me wrong, but look at the very first spider-man movie and this. I don't know if it's the cast, maybe Tom Holland is really so young and I really did not like him in this role. I feel like the movie kept on getting worse. Personal opinion.", "Good but overrated": "The movie was good but nothing perfect. I was so bored the firsy hour. When Tobey and Andrew showed up i started to enjoy it more. I would like to see a more epic way for Andrew and Tobey's entrance. The script was bad for me. Especially the part where ned can open portals. As i said it was just a good movie. Nothing perfect.", "Amazing Movie": "A very gold happiness about appearing of old spiders man also Benedict had a significant role which it was amazing.The performance was really great all over the whole cast.", "Impressive!": "This is what a movie looks like when you know less about politics and more about cinematography! At last! And the audience roars the highest score of the last 4 years. So those directors and producers destroying heroes like Luke Skywalker or Bond will have a spark of sanity, I hope, after seeing the big difference Spider Man No Way Home makes. I can't believe there is actually hope to new movies. My next hope is to repair the last 10 sequels on Star Wars, 007, Thor, Terminator and even Santa Claus, all made since 2016.", "Almost dream come true": "Finally, we got to see Tobey Maguire.as Spider-Man again!The only reason I went to the cinema was to see him in action again. This was a great gift for the fans of different Spider-Man series - something like a celebration.The pleasant surprise was to see Willem Dafoe (Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin) and Alfred Molina (Dr. Otto Octavius), alongside with the stars from other Spider-Man movies.It had little funny moments characteristic to Spider-Man series, and to see the three Spider-Mans interact with each other and work as a team was fun (I'd prefer Tobey to have taken the main spot, though).Overall I gave it 9/10, because I had a good time and I appreciate how well the movie was made - top class. I would have given it one billion out of 10 rating if the movie were built around Tobey.", "One of best experience after infinity war and endgame": "I love this movie\nThe way they they connect 3 universe's timeline\nAnd made it look like one..Full of nostalgia and emotionsThe ending of movie is showcase what makes Peter Parker a true Spiderman.", "This does put a smile on my face": "Truth be told no film is really a perfect 10, but if there's ever a film thats come close to checking off every expectation I had for it, its no way home.This is every spider-mans fans wet dream come true, bundled up in equal parts nostalgia, well-paced, surprising creative fight scenes, and emotional acting from Tom Holland (He really brings back that 'I don't feel so good' energy for this one).Well done Marvel.", "ONE OF THE BEST": "I am happy I saw this movie. By far, this movie spider-man no way home is one of the best spider man movies out of all of them! Watch it!!!!

First half of the film 1/10, really poor and sloppy writing filled with plotholes.Second half is 3/10 i was expecting a grand final fight but what i got was a bland fighting sequence lame. I was continuoisly thinking when was the movie going to get better and it was 2 hours gone already and i knew it was garbage, waste of time, waste of money.", "One of the best films this year": "Wow. I am left speechless hours after watching this movie. \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is heartfelt yet surreal, adventurous and empathetic, visually stunning yet spirited. This movie stays true to the very definition of the MCU. The conclusion was absolutely phenomenal. I am still left speechless.This is hands down, one of the best movies of the year, and quite likely the best MCU movies of the year. \"No Way Home\" outshines the other movies in the spider man trilogy, and after the first viewing, it will always hold a place in my heart. I cannot wait to see it again. Furthermore, Tom Holland was superb, Zendaya was great, Benedict Cumberbatch was excellent, and OH GOD the second end credit was out of this world.Marvel fan or not, this is one movie you DO NOT want to miss,. Everybody, yes even you, will find some comfort and joy in this enthralling adventure.", "Everything I wanted and More": "During the lead up to release I did my best to avoid any advertising and possible spoilers, stressful times, but paid off massively. Pure cinema magic. Incredible stuff.", "Emotional movie with great self awareness": "This is the best MCU movie since Infinity War. I'm so tired of these subversive stories that undercut emotion for cheap laughs. No Way Home though is humorous in all the right spots and emotional when it's supposed to be. It's one of the few MCU movies to have palpable stakes, but it never comes at the expense of a fun movie. That, and it has excellent awareness of meme culture.", "If there's one thing that this flick proves . . .": ". . . it's that Spider-Man would win a \"Biggest Loser\" contest hands down--and we're not talking about weight. Even after dragging in random Peter Parkers from the far nooks of the Multiverse, SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME proves that there is not a winner among the whole sorry lot. Someone causing more harm than benefit to Society can certainly be labeled as being \"A Public Enemy,\" even if Jonah J. Over-rates him by tabbing Peter as \"Number One.\" By the close of this story, Pete himself seconds this notion, by giving up any future acquaintance with the best M. J. ever.", "Finally, a Marvel movie that isn't media-hyped!": "A moment to rejoice! After a long time the critics are totally in sync with me. Yesterday, I found something refreshing. And the crowd was amazing and felt like before the COVID pandemic. This is one of the best Spider-man movies ever made!I couldn't watch Far From Home in IMAX but still it was nice. Thanks to Disney, the bright images, especially when you see Dr. Strange scenes (no spoilers!), completely uses the whole screen with a little of chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Being able to pull it off with extraordinarily daring stunt work - augmented by gritty CGI and sentiments is simply awe-inspiring!It may have taken almost 20 years, 9 movies, 3 different lead actors, 2 reboots but Spidey has finally shown redemption. This new trilogy places emotions without unnecessary drama and brings new dimensions. This time it has a string of sentiments sizzling its screenplay. Finally you see real drama, just like Nolan showed us in the Dark Knight Trilogy!Spiderman is not just a teenage boy but can Strange convince him or not? In the trailer, he mentions \"everyone will forget you are Peter Parker!\" The question is: Can Spider-man carry his own weight in the near future without the Avengers? The best villain Doc Oct finally arrives. I don't want to spoil the fun, so enjoy watching the movie!My significant digit score: 8.2/10.", "Everything you could ask for and MORE!": "This movie is a phenomenal blend of story, emotion, action, drama, nostalgia, humour, and heartfelt momentsIt is a love letter to the creators, actors, and fans of all spiderman movies before it, but above all that, it is a good MOVIEA lot of comicbook movies put nostalgia and the woo factor before the story and chatacters, this was especially a threat to this movie with all the chatacters weve loved coming back but the movie delivers on every aspect of what a good movie should have!The story is gripping, filled with heartfelt AND heartbreaking momentsNot one character is left without purpose, every choice makes sense and adds another layer to the mixThe humour never feels forcedThe action is breathtaking, fluid, so visually immersive, its hypnotizingThe writers and directors did such a great job at telling this story that even the moments that would have most people roll their eyes as \"fan service\" make you tear upHats off to everyone that worked on creating this masterpiece.", "Lame storyline for a well made film": "The cinematography, the acting are excellent, however you cannot escape the fact that the storyline is unbelievably lame. As I write this the films rating is over 9, so maybe this is just me (and my wife).I won't \"spoil\" the film (if that is possible) by revealing the \"storyline\" but lets just say its a film that you should wait to come on TV, unless you are a Marvel fan .... in which case you'll probably be one of the ones voting the film to 9/10 and you'll obviously love it.", "Disappointing after all the hype": "Months after its release i finally saw the movie and i find it worse than the first two it didn't deserve all that hype, the dialogue was bad and the crappy jokes in the wrong moments didn't let the film have any dramatic weight, my take on the first trilogy is that it was barely entertaining it didn't have the epic feel of the Raimi trilogy, my hope for the new Spider-Man films is that they hire a better director and let him have creative freedom so we can get great films also i hope the next movies distance themselves from MCU as much as they can if it's obligatory to have an MCU character let it be for a scene or a cameo and please change Zendaya, let No Way Home be her last film why can't we have hot actresses as love interests anymore ? Enough with this quirky nerdy girl cr*p.", "Feeling like rating it 6 makes me the villain": "Saw it in theatres today. Seats were absolutely packed from A to Z. I think in general everyone's reaction was good. There were claps and laughter as always. Personally, I could not wait for it to end. I think Marvel does a really good job of taking the audience from their own universe and putting them into MCU, literally making everyone feel like they live inside the MCU but this time, from start to finish, I felt like a complete viewer. I didn't even feel close to MCU and at one point I started thinking about how they filmed the scenes and rating the actors' acting skills. Long story short the movie did not lure me in at all and I was left with nothing but a bitter taste in my mouth when the movie ended. I, however, loved how entertaining the dialogues were and loved how it made me feel that I was definetly watching Peter Parker, as always. So I'll give it a 6. Although after seeing the high rating, kinda makes me feel like there's something wrong with me.", "Testament": "That this movie currently has 8.7/10 is a testament to the absolute rampant stupidity in our society.That the by far worst movie of the trilogy gets the most praise is very strange. The fun on ridiculousness of the first two movies has here been replaced with a completely far feached and utterly boring plot filled with forced drama and lame fan service.", "WE DONT DESERVE THIS": "I would never imagine we would get this movie. My theater went wild.Constantly surprising, clever, really well acted and so many actors reprise their roles it's shocking.Wow.", "An Almost Mediocre Marvel Film": "Upon reading the title, don't get me wrong! Having to be different from other Marvel films is actually quite an achievement. I may sound biased but it's pretty much the truth in my opinion. Moving on, Spider-Man: NWH is a direct sequel from Far From Home. It started normal, there was nothing special or mind-blowing in the start of the movie. However, what was special in my opinion was that Marvel optimized the use of the Multi-Verse. What made the whole movie a little more intriguing was the usage of Multi-Verse. I've watched all the Spider-Man series and am more or less quite familiar with the stories of the villains. Having a new concept called the Multi-Verse makes viewers look at Marvel as an organisation that's very creative, even though I believe there was such thing as that in the comics. Whatever it is, I believe having the Multi-Verse is a great platform or an edge to produce better films. However, overusing the Multi-Verse concept may arise the sense of ennui between viewers. Moving on, the cinematography were quite basic just like most Marvel films. The plot and storyline of NWH was quite interesting, as mentioned above, due to the use of Multi-Verse. Of all the actors, Willem Dafoe performed the best among all of them. Next, having three Spider-Men actually makes the film a little awkward at the end as there was no chemistry between them, not like between Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon - they had great chemistry as they were together since the first. Overall, the movie was what I expected and having to rate it a 7/10 was quite impressive for an almost mediocre Marvel film.IHR.", "Exceeded all expectations!": "When all of the audience are clapping and cheering at the same time, you know it's a monumental movie. Spider-Man No Way Home make me in awe. I have no words.", "Sooooooo overhyped!!!": "The whole premise of the entire movie is based on a share stupidity of the main character(Peter 1)!!!Was expecting so much. But got stupid people doing stupid shiet.Authors just simply ran out of reasons for the bad guys to apear.Totally hyped by the \"fanboys\".No better words to describe this!", "Oh hell yayyyy": "It was so freaking awesome!!!!!!!!! Worth the wait! The best spider man movie I have seen so far and it killed!!! I'm so happy I saw it!! It was jaw dropping!! Don't want to spoil nothing for people that haven't seen it but holy *rap it was good.", "Best Marvel Movie So Far": "My honest opinion is it Is by far the greatest Marvel movie I have ever watched, it was packed with action, sad moments, I loved seeing willem Dafoe and the rest of the gang\nEspecially Tobey and Andrew\nThis deserves 10 out of 10.", "Utterly Fantastic": "There are no words, utterly fantastic, I'm not an avid marvel fan and yet I enjoyed this film tremendously. If you watched the Spider-Man films even once growing up you will love this. The nostalgia is just insane and I could have cried. It's a must watch for everyone, best film I've seen in YEARS.", "Childhood Dream": "Where do I even begin, sitting in the cinema when it debuted on the 16th December it was the best thing ever, the film was dark, fast paced, full of consequences basically the film lived up to the hype NO WAY HOME, if you're not a Marvel fan for you to understand this film you'll have to watch the first Spiderman movie released in the early 2000s. Nevertheless this is the best Spiderman movie ever made.", "TOM HOLLAND!!!!": "Best performance in any superhero movie I have ever seen!!! Aunt may scene was phenomenal. Batman is great but let me just say this: SPIDER-MAN HAS HAD NO BAD MOVIES. Batman has had a few bad and trash films. NWH has entered the elite list of comic book movies such as TDK trilogy, joker, endgame, infinity war, Spider-Man 2.", "The best the MCU has to offer.": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is a culmination of 20 years of Spider-Man.. live-action that is. The film had a lot of anticipation and hype surrounding it due to the numerous leaks and rumors surrounding it, and managed to exceed the expectations set by fans. As a huge fan, this movie is perfection in every way when it comes to both the MCU and Spider-Man.Tom Holland's Peter Parker (Peter 1), Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker (Peter 2) and Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker (Peter 3) had amazing chemistry from start to finish, Peter 2 of course stealing the spotlight for each scene he was in. The movie offers closure to fans of both film entries, such as Maguire's organic webbing, how the three characters would interact, how the villains would respond to being \"fixed.\"Oddly enough, the best this film has to offer isn't even the amazing acting served by Tom Holland nor the intense action sequences. It would be the dialogue, more specifically toward the death of May Parker. As a grieving Peter was just shot mere moments after having his dying aunt in his arms, he had to hear J Jonah Jameson call him a menace and everything wrong with the city, essentially blaming him for his own aunts death. This scene was beautifully shot, one of the main reasons I watched it in theaters on 8 separate occasions.The dialogue between the three Spider-Men was all that the fans ever wanted to see, and boy did they deliver. Peter 2 and 3 share a moment prior to meeting Peter 1, All three embrace in a hug toward the end, they swing together, they fight together, they crack jokes together.. the chemistry between the three Spider-Men was just amazing. This film is my favoite Spider-Man movie, favorite comic film, and definitely my favorite MCU film as a whole. 10/10 rec.", "Ranks Third Of The Best Superhero Movies": "Frankly, a legendary movie in the truest sense of the word. Although there were some points that are questionable and confusing or needs more elaboration which we might get the answers in the next movies (they must give us the answers). Also, we saw some characters of the previous movies that were not in the MCU, we wish they continue appearing in the MCU especially \"TH's V\" who got marginalized! Overall, it's a legendary movie.", "Absolutely terrific! Unbelievably so": "One thing I love about MCU movies is that no matter how awesome the trailer is, it seldom really gives you any plot of the movie. You make assumptions based on the trailer and the actual movie still keeps some surprises. This is no exception and whatever you thought this was about, it is about so much more and in such a much better way. I normally love spoilers but I tried to avoid them for this and I am glad I did. Even if I told you the exact story, my telling would not come close to the actual movie.Willem Defoe is in the movie as trailers show but he really shines. Not only is his costume better without the silly helmet but he really plays Green Goblin with the strength and confidence I wish he had in the Rami movie. I think he is right up there with Heath Ledger's Joker.Don't miss this movie and don't miss the great story, acting and characters.", "Could've been Amazing, Spectacular, and we got ok": "This movie had the potential to be one of the best superhero movies ever, three spidermen from different franchises together fighting the sinister 5? Still, amazing idea and concept, seeing the three of them together and bond. Making Tom Holland's spider finally being the best Spider-Man. It had so much potential, but the director didn't do a good job.Giving us only a few scenes of the three spidermen together, not giving us enough bonding moments, not playing with the concept, killing Aunt May in the lamest way possible, not having more and better and interesting fights. EVERY superhero crossover has a fight, everyone knows it, it's a basic concept of these kind of comics. Andrew should've fought Tobey and then Tom should've stopped the fight, but this director was very basic with the whole concept and ideas for this movie.Don't get me wrong, it's a fun movie, it's good, but it could've been one of MCU's best.", "Spider-Man fan's dream come true! Marvel pulls off the impossible once again.": "I'm just as shocked as everyone else. I cannot BELIEVE how good this movie is. I've never seen a film live up to the hype so PERFECTLY in my life (apart from Infinity War and Endgame). One of the most enjoyable, entertaining, chill-inducing movie experiences I've ever had.Seeing this in the theater will be an experience I never forget. I will remember December 20th, 2021. There wasn't an over abundance of cheering, but when Tobey and Andrew showed up, people couldn't help but cheer. Possibly the greatest cinema experience I've ever had, you could just feel the energy.If you had told me before this came out that this was gonna top nearly every single MCU movie before it, I would've laughed in your face. This film was a recipe for disaster. So many things could've gone wrong, but fortunately, they didn't. They did everything perfectly. Nobody I know is disappointed in the SLIGHTEST with how this turned out.It may be a little overhyped at the moment, and I told myself I was not gonna let the hype get to me, but it did. Idgaf, 10/10 stars. This is a Spider-Man fans dream come true. My Best movie of 2021 without a doubt, and the best spider-man movie (haven't rewatched Into the Spider-Verse though). Can't wait to watch this again.However, I really hope the overly inflated rating balances out, because this is not a top 15 movie of all time\ud83d\ude02.", "super fun": "My first movie in theatre after all the covid-19 saga! My first ever 4DX experience!All this may have added to the fact why I enjoyed it so muchhhh!! Total fun! Loved it! \ud83c\udf89", "Above average superhero movie": "It's quite fine. The pace is fast and there are a lot of characters and small events so you are seldom bored and there are quite a few smart scenes with fast humor. Basically, everything with Doctor Strange and the 2 other Spider-Mans is quite good and interesting. Mostly because\nTobey Maguire and Benedict Cumberbatch are great actors. So instead of being silly gag scenes we get real emotions and experiences with these 2 actors. Besides them though the movie largely relies on small gags and CGI. The gags work quite well, but it's hard to hear many of the smaller jokes because the music is overly loud. Same with the action scenes. Most are set at night so while they seem cool I had a hard time making out the smaller details. The pacing of the action and dialogue also makes it hard to to fully understand and follow all scenes.The main issue is actually the plot. Doctor Strange and Spider-Man together plan this spell that then goes wrong and gets innocent people killed. So there is no external bad guy making this happen. They actually resurrect already dead bad guys from other universes. Then Spider-Man trusts them blindly instead of keeping them in small prison cells they put them in. He frees them and they of course rebel and get people killed. Kinda predictable. But it's Spider-Man screwing up all the way. The movie makes this VERY clear. It's not some fight against something evil. It's just Spider-Man creating giant problems for everyone and then solves just some of them. It's not like he can resurrect dead people. So the theme is very hard to find here. I was constantly waiting for some twist or explanation to make the theme work. Surely it's not Spider-Man himself who is the villain? But the movie just keeps going in this one single direction with the hero himself screwing up scene by scene. Even at the very end he gets another Spider-Man nearly killed. All people who get hurt in this movie get hurt only because of Spider-Man. So what's the point? It's flashy, fast, and there are a lot of big CGI action scenes. But Spider-Man as a character doesn't really go anywhere concrete. It's nice to see the best villains from the past movies return. It's also nice to see New York as a proper place with real streets and stores. The digital camera makes everything look crisp and colorful. So it's fun. It's a basic plot about screwing up and kinda fixing it. But the movie doesn't really bring anything new to the Marvel universe and doesn't feel like it's a Spider-Man film that really stands out. Since I didn't much care for the Spider-Man movies with Toby and hated the Andrew Garfield movies this one is better. But the character has greater potential than this. There needs to be something to fight and fix.A final important note is a theme they tried to create where all the bad guys can actually be cured by the advanced technology in his world. That's why he frees them - to take away their power and evilness in one. So the movie is telling us that no one is actually bad they just have some sickness that can be cured. Which of course is utter nonsense. What even is this message? With technology you can fix all evil in this world? No one is really that evil? I'm not sure what the movie tries to be or why we can't just have bad guys being bad. What's the message?", "No story line": "Worst movie.

It is iconic and will go down in history and is already breaking box office records - watched it on opening night and i've never heard a uk crowd clap and cheer so much! I've grown up loving andrew garfield and tom holland and i was so enthralled to see tobey too it !! I literally couldn't believe my eyes because andrew's interviews made it so convincing that he wasn't in it so i was soooo happy. It's a rollercoaster of emotions . The ending was perfect but so sad. A 100/10 movie.", "Best movie of the year": "I was really flashed when I saw this movie in 3D cinema. I haven't watched any spoilers.It was a typicall avengers-like beginning. Since the presence of doc oc it was amazing. The highlight of the movie was the return of tobey and andrew. Fully surprised.For me the ending was perfect. Very Emotiona like in the old spider man movies and it looks like the story goes back to the beginning of spider man 2002. To be honest, I don't like Spider man in the Avangers Team. Spider man deserves an own movie without too much science fiction and too much magic of avangers. This one was an exception and a masterpiece as well. But from there the spidey should story should go back to the roots.", "Pretty stupid movie": "\"Hey homicidal maniacs. Let's go to my place and order pizza. Whaddaya say?\"It has some action eye candy. But the overall film falls flat in a multitude of ways. The CGI of Spider-Man, the Lizard, and others is horrendous. It is reminiscent of the cartoon characters in Who Framed Roger Rabbit. But at least in the Roger Rabbit movie, you were expecting to see cartoon characters.I guess Hollywierd has run out of tricks. So they reverted to the equivalent of pulling rabbits out of hats and sawing pretty ladies in half in a box. There is nothing new or perplexing here. Just a bunch of nonsensical, illogical writing and obviously bad decisions that defy common sense.I dozed off a couple of times. If you do not watch this movie you will not miss anything. If you decide to watch it, enjoy the cartoony CGI fest and boring humor.", "Not Perfect, But A Very Satisfying Movie.": "This definitely isn't the best made film, even of the MCU, but then again, I had such a great time with this film.While nostalgia done badly can just feel like pandering, No Way Home manages to mostly turn nostalgia into something great. There were some times, like the apartment scene, where it relied to much on nostalgia, but for the most part, it includes it very well into the story, to the point where it made sense, like with Tobey and Andrew's Spider-Man.While I am fan of Tom Holland's Spider-Man, this movie really enhances is story, especially near the end, where everyone forgets him, and Aunt May is dead, and he still willing to be Spider-Man.I will admit that some of the writing in this film isn't strong. It rushes through the story where Peter's identity revealed, and the reason why the multiverse broke is because Doctor Strange is to impulsive to talk to Peter about it was just lazy writing. It's also worth noting that the Visual Effects aren't really good, especially the Bridge scene.Overall, while this film does have problems, it's an absolute joy ride with well-executed nostalgia, and the story of Tom Holland's Spider-Man becoming something great.", "Classic Marvel": "I dont understand high rating. Most of them given by hardcore fans. Overall predictable story with a lot of plot holes. This movie has a lot of little scenes showing well-known charactes which for hardcore fans is like a dream. That is the reason for high ratings.", "Greatest Superhero Movie Ever!!": "A Masterpiece in every way!! Not just the best Spider-man movie of all time but possibly the best superhero movie..................................................................", "Why Spider-Man is the Greatest Superhero! Fan Service at it's best!": "**MAJOR SPOILERS** The movie was phenomenal with so many call backs to past films and it was the perfect fan service film! I truly wish it was longer because it is sheer gold. I hope we get to see Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man again somewhere down the line. For all those people complaining about Tom Holland's Peter Parker/Spider-Man, this movie quells all those complaints. This is a high stakes high octane adrenaline rush of a roller coaster with so many ups and downs! Spidey goes through the absolute most in this! We get shades of the Sinister Six in this film without the film feeling bogged down by the sheer number of characters. I wish that Mysterio had shown up again as a villain to take his rightful place in the six, but hey, maybe in the future!. I love how each character got to say lines from the past and the movie was over all very funny and entertaining. Some of my favorite quips were Doctor Octopus saying \"the power of the Sun in the palm of my hands\", the Green Goblin saying \"I'm something of a scientist myself\", and Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker complaining about his back problems. I also love how Andrew Garfield Spider-Man got a second chance to save a Spider-Man love interest from falling to her death. This was such a beautiful movie and I can't believe they actually showed the spider sense like how it is depicted in the comics in a live-action film. I marked out so many times and I was paying attention to everything. I even noticed that on that van they had a tribute to Steve Ditko as they graffiti his name on the side of it. The fact that they had Aunt May say the \"with great power, there also must come great responsibility\" line straight out of the comics gave me chills! And the fact that they had the Classic Spiderman costume color scheme at the end! This movie was totally awesome and I can't wait to watch it 100 more times! When the three Spider-Men share the screen, it is every bit as iconic as we all imagined it would be! Such chemistry, and such an amazing, spectacular and ultimate superhero movie! Only Spider-Man 2 can boast about being so good of a Spider-Man movie. This movie, in my opinion, is right next to Infinity War and Endgame in scale and execution. Don't miss out on the event of a lifetime!", "MCU's best Spider-Man Film": "Spider-Man: No Way Home takes place right after Far From Home where Mysterio frames Spider-Man for the drone attack on London and his own death and then exposes his identity as Peter Parker. Not only does this affect him, but also his best friend Ned and his girlfriend MJ. To fix the problems he and his loved ones face, Peter seeks out Dr. Strange to cast a spell so everyone will forget he is Spider-Man. A multiversal crisis occurs allowing enemies from other dimensions to return.If you told me a Spider-Man film like this would be released ten years ago, I would have called you crazy, but here we are. Spider-Man is one of the first franchises that got me into superhero content. However, I have felt kind of lukewarm about the last two MCU Spider-Man films. They're enjoyable films, but I think they both could have been much better. Even with the overwhelming praise this film got, I still went in cautiously optimistic because I did not want to feel letdown from the hype. Little did I know what NWH would have in store...Without question, Spider-Man: No Way Home is my favorite film of the year. This not only made me gleefully ecstatic as a Spider-Man fan, but it reminds me why I love movies to begin with. Watching something like this on the big screen felt like entering another dimension. This movie has a very difficult story to pull off using multiversal elements regarding older Spider-Man films and Jon Watts nails nearly every aspect of the story. It he script is intriguing and unpredictable, the pacing is perfect, the the humor is natural and hilarious, the dimension aspect works beautifully and the movie delves into consequences of Spider-Man's actions very well. Not only does he get punished, but the people he is closest to are punished as well, even Aunt May. This storytelling makes me wonder what more possibilities could there be with the different dimensions or if TASM lasted longer, what would that film's third villain be like here. The story itself is great here and there is never a dull moment, not even in the quieter scenes.The cast is at its best as well. Tom Holland once again nails his role as the young and altruistic Spider-Man, but he goes beyond just being Spider-Man. Holland's performance helps highlight the more insecure side of Peter Parker. He really does not want to lose the people he love and it comes off as natural, not forced. This is Holland's best performance as Peter Parker and Spider-Man to date. What really surprised me was Zendaya as MJ and Jacob Balaton as Ned Leeks. She has much chemistry with Holland this time around and she is a positive force in this film. She is honestly my favorite Spider-Man film love interest now. Ned Leeks on the other hand went from annoying me to having me crack up this time around. What really drives it home is that these two share great chemistry with Holland to the point where I see them as three best friends in real life, not just in the MCU. Marisa Tomei Aunt May is at her best too. She is a great mother figure for Peter and her death scene really got me. Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange is also great in both dramatic and comedic scenes. The main cast from the MCU is stellar and their chemistry grew here...SPOILERS...but then the characters from the other Spider-Man films show up and this is where it gets interesting. Alfred Molina as Otto Octavius found a great balance between humor in discovering the new dimension and remaining threatening. Jamie Foxx's performance as Electro is much better here than it was in TASM 2. The stand out however? William Defoe as the Green Goblin. This performance might even be better than his original performance in the first live-action Spider-Man film. He is both frightening and sympathetic. I wouldn't be surprised if he got nominated for an Oscar. What made me really lose my mind was seeing Andrew Garfield and Tobey McGuire. I had the biggest grin on my face and I heard other people in the theater cheer. Andrew Garfield's performance as Spider-Man might be my favorite. He is hilarious and lovable, but also sad as he recounts his experience from TASM 2. McGuire is fantastic as well being the more experienced and mature Peter Parker. I just cannot believe that we have the three Spider-Mans in the same film. It felt like I was watching a movie from tens years ago and it was the best feeling I had in theaters in years.As for the production, it is a marvel (pun intended)! The action scenes are so crisp and smooth. They are intense and dynamic while not being too long or too short. The fight between Dr. Strange and Spider-Man is one of my favorite MCU fights. It is so trippy and insane that it needs to be seen to believe. The first fight with Dr. Octopus comes close as well. It is so expertly shot and smooth and it exhibits Spider-Man's trait of saving others during a fight. This movie blows the other two MCU Spider-Man films out of the water as far as action goes. The special effects look great as well. The CGI looks clean, but not too shiny, the stunt work is impressive and the cinematography is some of the best in the MCU. Right off the bat, this movie has an outstanding tracking shot that fits the web-slinging superhero perfectly. The musical score by Michael Giacchino is perfect. It is one of the best MCU scores because it fits both the character and the cinematic universe while sounding extremely memorable during the action and quiet scenes.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a comic book movie miracle. I try not to gush about films from Marvel too much, but this is one of the best Marvel films out there. It may not be perfect, but I have not been filled with so much happiness with a movie in theaters as much as this one in years. I just wonder where the franchise will go from here. The options are wide open. This is a must-see for all Spider-Man and Marvel fans and even people who don't care for comic book movies may enjoy this film. It is beautifully made and full of heart.Oh, and stay through all of the credits as usual.", "Really? Incoherent and stupid": "SPOILER ALERT!How can you still be Spiderman and Peter Parker and nobody connects once the big thing happened? I mean who do they think Spiderman was if Spiderman is and was still a thing? Sloppy nostalgia dipped into a camera on a blender, stupid sky opening sequence (why why why) and bored as hell - intro was fun though, and Andrew Garfield was great.", "Another Bomb of Fresh Action and Tough Emotion": "No Way Home never lets the solid 148 minutes go to waste, packing it with the blazing web-slinging action and even touching fans' hearts with pure emotion. It's obvious and clear that within the sustained runtime, a lot is gonna happen. And by this Spider-Man instalment's poignant ending, you'll realise why there's so many spoiler reviews throughout its aftermath.As said and without spoiling, this brilliantly designed action movie is abundantly eventful and exhilarating. It might mean there's emotional deaths of shining characters, but it could easily mean that the action's a lot more frequent than in the previous films or it could end tragically. Luckily, No Way Home stuck with the best outcome of the greatest Spider-Man action sequences we've probably ever seen in a Spider-Man instalment.One thing that needs to be said clear about this sequel is the fact that it's actually really emotional, and despite its bomb of majestic humour, a tear might actually slip out your eyes a few times. Tom Holland, Zendaya and the other heroes and villains only continue to get better with appealing improvements. The action is spectacularly edited and created, but there's unforgettable heart amongst the entertaining steps it takes. Considering Far From Home was a blast and how this one is just as breathtaking, another sequel will be highly anticipated.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.", "Better than Endgame": "The director's excellence we can see here. Tom Holland's acting both as Peter Parker and Spiderman is fabulous. The difficulties in Peter's life and the huge sacrifice as Spiderman Tom Holland shows in this movie perfectly. Then I obviously come to the biggest surprise of this movie. Another two spidermans from different universes. Our childhood favourite Spidey Tobey Maguire as a versatile actor he has done his work so perfectly that he proved he will always be our best friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. His debut in this movie is the biggest surprise. Then Our cool Spidey Andrew's (2012-2014) entrance was so much impressive, his role as Peter Parker was 10 out of 10. Overall this movie gonna to be memorable forever. I think the best MCU movie far better than Endgame cause Spidey has made our childhood and Spider-Man is such a superhero that everyone loves him, Spidey's fanbase is huge enough than other superheroes. Spidey is nostalgia.", "The greatest movie ever since avengers end game": "I absolutely love this movie, the cast is amazing, the reunion of all the Spider-Man actors made it wholesome and awesome to watch. The action and comedy was perfect. Absolutely in love with this movie. I literally don't have words to describe how much excitement and joy this movie gave me. The comedy was perfect, what you'd expect from a marvel movie. I felt like there was nothing lacking in this movie. Absolutely perfect all around.", "A very satisfying ending to the trilogy": "So let me start by saying that i loved Spider-Man Homecoming. It was a great story. Spider-Man Far From Home was a movie i anticipated since it was anounced,but in the end i was disappointed. I was scared for No Way Home. After finishing the movie i was shocked at how good it was. The acting is brilliant,the story isn't perfect but i like it. One big problem i see people complaining about is the CGI,while i see the problem it doesn't take that much from the movie. The third act by far is my favourite. Seeing Tobey and Andrew fight alongside Tom is great and their chemistry is perfect. The ending was absolutely beatiful and it has me excited for the next trilogy.", "Thank you Sony and Marvel for this Christmas present": "This is a celebration of all the spiderman movies that have been made till now. We are living in the golden era of superhero movies. Coming to the movie this movie has everything. Brilliant story, stunning CGI, great direction, much awaited yet surprising cameo of 'You now who' and so-so brutal fighting sequences(I dropped my so many times during the fighting scenes) and on the top of that the impactful performances from each and every member of the cast especially merisa tomai, Tom holand, William Dafoe. So grateful for this movies. That Marvel and Sony for doing this partnership and thank you Disney for allowing both Sony and Marvel working together.", "Fan service no story": "The sole purpose of this film is the fan service it provides, the story is nonexistent and can be resumed to \"hey here is someone/a line you know\" from another movie every 5 min. Had to force myself to stay in the theater until the end.Only the special effects are ok.", "A good flick because it was big and..": "Expensive and the acting was actually very good. But something was off.. I just didn't enjoy it as much as the previous Spider-Man movies... I gave it a 7 because it just seemed too commercial and farcical. I guess after 20 yrs of Spider-Man and the Avengers I've just outgrown it lol. It's time for Disney to take the Marvel franchise a new direction totally or better yet just leave Marvel behind and let Disney go back to being creative like it was 50 years ago. We need something new.", "It's an ok movie but with some good surprises.": "Didn't find it as good as people made it sound. Quite bubbly, cheezy, kiddish unrealistic rubbish. Not for someone who wants to watch something more serious.Great actors, and action sequences are good but wouldn't watch it again unless it's to entertain some teenagers and kids. Didn't enjoy it much. Don't even want to talk about the villains reunion..! And their attitudes.. lol. Just watch and you may like it but for me it was a no no.", "It was incredible": "Everything you wanted to become witness on the big screen..Everything you wanted to hear.. Everything you wanted to experience..\nMultiply it by 100 times and you get Spider-Man Noway Home.This movie is the culmination of your Spidey Fanboy moments.", "Step up after Far from Home": "It's definitely better than the previous one. I still dislike Tom Holland as a Spider-Man and this nostalgia driven plot proved my feelings.The template used by Jon Watts for every single Spider Man movie with awkwardly long sentimental scenes, closed with wanna be funny Ned moment. It just does not work for me.Movie is saved by old school villains, old Spider-Men and good old fashion needless loss of life as motivating factor.", "An Experience to Remember": "This movie had all my expectations. I like how Marvel Studios give us what we wanted when we wanted it. This movie is easily a top 3 Spider-Man movie. I can't wait for what doctor Strange in The Multiverse of Madness has installed for us \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "Top": "This is the best movie I have ever seen, the best Spider-Man movie, also the best for special effects and VFX, this is amaaaaaazing.

Also the made Peter Parker a little bit h. Def not worth the hype it got lazy writing boring plot that went no where.", "Overrated at best": "After hearing about this film I had moderate expectations but the film didn't come close. Sure Tom Holland can act and it was nice to see some familiar faces but after watching it I was left wondering if it was worth my while. I think that the praise that the film received took away from the hype that Dune deserved which was a film that was well above my high expectations of it.", "Nostalgic/Forced Play on Spider-Man": "Like a lot of people, I knew that the previous two Spider-Man and their villians will be featured in this movie because of social media. And that the movie centered around the multiverse, and how it was broken open by Strange's Spell in attempt to fulfill Tom's Peter Parker request to make everyone (almost everyone) forget his Spider-Man identity. Still, it was great to see a lot of old faces from my childhood and teenage years. And damn, Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin, and Andrew Garfield acting performance were the best parts of the movie. However, the interaction between the characters and the new characters seems forced/unnatural. It almost seem like Aunt May had to die so that the three Spider-Man got something in common (in addition to the quote, \" With great power comes great responsibility.\" And somehow they need Michelle Jones to be there in some scenes, and Ned Leeds to have magic. All in all, everything seems forced. My take is that it should be a two part movie, or a mini series for the old and new characters to develop the chemistry. Lastly, why is this movie like top 16 on imdb?", "Overrated?": "Weak plot, (written on a napkin?) influenced by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (sometimes felt like a direct ripoff) Way to much pointless CGI. Teenage melodrama with very poor jokes and \"cute\" scenes (gramma). Best part of the movie was with Tom Hardy after the credits. During the whole move my though was wth am I watching! Even my kids asked when is this over and how log the movie is. They wanted this to end!This move is so undeniably overrated that I actually fear for future of humanity. I feel like Ricky Gervails joke about bleach is actually a good idea!Remove \"Do Not Drink\" warning from bleach bottles for 2 years and than let people vote.", "Almost fell asleep": "The movie tries to dazzle and is successful in it special effects. It starts to be cumbersome in the dialogue, where the story is dragging. The humor doesn't catch on and dialog is boring at moments. It was entertaining enough for a positive score, but I will not call it \"very good\".", "Enjoyable, but just okay.": "Honestly, I thought this movie was just okay. First off, Peter didn't think to call the University, or have him and his friends apply to other colleges lol \ud83d\ude02 This was a weak plot and weak reason for bringing in spidermen from the multiverse. I feel that the movie criticized itself in this scene where Dr. Strange asked him if he called MIT. Lol. All of it could have been prevented if Peter had just called MIT.They made genius Dr. Strange look super dumb and careless because he gave Peter what he wanted without considering the repercussions on the entire world.I really wish there was a more intelligent/complex plot. Peter was making a lot of weird decisions such as wanting to jab villains and fix them. But the consequence of that seemingly noble intention was that he loses his one and only family member left, Aunt May. Peter doesn't think much in this movie. He is very careless.It's cool to have 3 spidermen in a screen, but give us more than that, like more interesting dialogue. I thought that there would be more strategic dialogue between the different spidermen, but they were just told to use their Peter senses, which wasn't much strategising at all lol. The curing the bad guys seemed way too easily accomplished.There were some funny moments and sad moments, so actors/actresses did a good job at acting. However, overall the plot/story arc, needs to improve and needs to have more uniqueness/creativity, if they want people to keep watching. Aside from having all 3 spidermen on screen, this movie was just okay. Would I watch it again? Probably no.If you're a spider-man lover, you might be in love with it and fail to see all the weakness that other viewers have mentioned on here.", "The marvel movie aesthetic has changed!": "This movie some how did not feel like a regular marvel film. The director did a great job using long shots and creative VFX to tell marvel's most compelling story. The acting is generally what you would expect from marvel, except for Tom. Tom has officially become the most realized Peter Parker. This movie ends on a note that allows new watchers to get the full picture and enjoy what comes next.Best,\nMoreTheGuy.", "Amusement park": "For those who are watching it after a long week work nd who only wants to ger entertained nd find a bit of escape for sometime.

Of course, we MUST be shown the press of Huhhlond in every film, where can we go without it!! How annoying it is...\nIt reminds me of Mary Jane's hostage scenes. 3 movies are good! But there at least it was necessary for the plot, and it was somehow justified! And constantly watching these ridiculous pubertal scenes is very unpleasant.2. Nothing has changed, a ton of stupid and sometimes completely meaningless \"humor\" that will be appreciated only by the narrow-minded, it is hardly.3. Did anyone even notice Matt Murdoch's cameo?! Not?! And it doesn't matter, and the whole line is with litigation! All this slipped just for show.4. Someone will tell me WHY there are so many villains in the film?! THERE IS HIS MOTHER OCTAVIUS SPENDING A pitiful 10 MINUTES!!!! WHY IS ELECTRIC NEEDED THERE??! TO SPOT LIGHTNING ONLY TWO TIMES?! Why are there the Lizard and the Sandman God....the whole film in its sandy form...and with disgusting graphics...how strange and cheap it is ... just a cartoon!5. The appearance of Tobey and Andrew...I have never seen the worst in my life. I clapped, but I didn't understand why I was doing it. Was it really impossible to do it beautifully, epic, and mentally??!! No... just another silly humor...\n6. And Aunt May's words about great power and responsibility! YES, ALMOST IN THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM, HER FACE SAYS THAT SHE IS A HORRIBLE AUNT, A GUARDIAN, AND EVERYTHING ELSE!!!!! After which she says these great words.... yes, I just wanted to shut her mouth.7. CATASTROPHICALLY LOW SCREEN TIME FOR SPIDERS.

Why were there scenes with Tom Holland's brother, or with green paint, if almost everything was cut from the film ??! IT WOULD BETTER SHOW MORE SPIDERS!!!!!!8. Graphics....here I just keep silent, OK??!! It was...very bad...I have never seen such bad CGI in such an expensive movie in my life!!!!9. The motivation of villains...it simply does not exist. And that's it! She is NOT.10. Have you noticed yes??!! There is only one villain in the movie, it's Holland's spider himself!!!!!!! Not a Goblin or anything.Well, yes, I also forgot about the director Jon Watts!11. I would still write! But I think I will stop at eleven. The last thing I want to say is that the film turned out to be very sudden, very hasty and chaotic, chaotic! For such a film, you need a longer timing!!!!!CHILDREN HAVE ROTTED TOMATOES OR PRESS FANS OF HOLLAND, BUT FACTS ARE FACTS.I went to the film with an unreal thrill in my heart!!!!And he came out with a feeling....of dissatisfaction, with a feeling of chagrin, and with an even greater hatred of Tom Holland.This is definitely not the best movie in the MCU!This is definitely not the best spider movie!!!And this is absolutely definitely not the best movie comic strip.

In order for the multiverse concept to happen, it seems like it endures with some cheap writings. The bigger MCU becomes, a lot of things have to compromise with the big picture. It creates a lot of ripples that don't match the flow. Hence it becomes forced and harder to keep the consistency than how it should be.Fight scenes are moderate, nothing spectacular except Dr Strange one's. A lot of cringe dialogues, scenes, and characters inconsistency. Again, too forced.Maybe a lot of fans will still root for NWH as it is a fine fan service after all. But as a movie itself, it is not good enough. Anything notable is William Dafoe's performance.It is nothing like what a fan boasts, that it levels with Endgame. No, not even close.", "Gives Endgame competition": "I truly loved this movie. Started slow, but it was also necessary for all the action and reveals that came along..

Villains from 2 Spiderman universe. But.Too much unfunny jokes. Too many interactive speech. Too many breaks. Too many talking. This was supposed to be brutal, fierce, like iron man 1 or 3.This had the best story, but poor execution. The best characters, hero, villains, but they were just on screen. They offered nothing.I've seen this movie 3 times in theatres. And 7 times on a screen and everytime I've tried to like it. I fail.This is to me the worst marvel movie after Doctor strange : multiverse of madness and black widow and venom 2.Imagine this movie was directed by David Fincher. Just try.", "Great MCU movie as expected": "As a movie that would be the turning point for the MCU, expectations were high. And the movie delivers enough.I guess the only small complaint I have is that, for such a huge impact on MCU, the motives seem too innocent. Peter wants to make sure his buddies make it to MIT after his identity gets uncovered by the media and his life turns into chaos. To accomplish this, he tries to convince Doc. Strange to help him out. Things turn to a bad shape when they mess up Tom Holland as Peter's timeline.The first expectatation is to see all Spideys together. Andrew's apperance is ok, but Toby delivers. Marvel knew what to do with him and it went down good enough to be enjoyable.One of the themes is Tom's Peter's conflict as a superhero. The plot develops itself in a cool pace.As a major turning point in the series, of course you expect one big event to happen during the movie. Predictable, but, again, good enough.The ending was good. One segment was expected, but I'm curious to see how that will turn out later. The additional credits was unexpected. The consequences, kinda expected, but exciting.Good entry to the MCU.", "All of you \"purist\" leaving crap reviews....just stop": "This movie is great. Marvel did another fantastic job and combining all of the different old villains and Spider-Man's together was a nice shot of nostalgia when this world really needed it. Go see the movie.

To all of you \"purists\" out there: We don't care about your reviews and we don't care about your dissections.

Well done all around.", "Best Superhero Movie of All Time": "Spider-Man no way home is an emotionally overwhelming, nostalgic, fan-serviced masterpiece. Stand out scenes such as Spider-Man's super sense in Happys' house and Tom Holland's end fight scene with The Green Goblin gives this movie an unforgettable sense of brilliance.The humour was genuinely funny, the fight scenes were entertaining and the relationships were well constructed. But what makes this film so impressive was perfecting the delicate balance of giving the fans what they want yet ensuring the storyline of Tom Holland's Spider-man made sense. Taking Peter Parker back to a broke friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man with a sense of responsibility and no connections was a master stroke.There were only three small issues for me. Firstly the \"fixing the villains\" sequence with all three Spider-Men seemed rushed and a little to easy. Secondly, the humour was good but towards the end of the film I feel as if it could've been toned down a little due to the situation. Lastly, the scene where Andrew Garfield catches MJ could have been better iced, for example putting it in extra slow motion, zooming in on Andrew diving and including flashbacks.Other than that, the movie was as good as it can possibility get for a marvel film that has to follow a pretty linear blueprint. If you love Spider-Man, you will cry, laugh, smile and gasp while watching this movie.", "It's so amazing it's a great movie": "I like this movie because the every Spider-Man coming this movie and this is amazing. And every bad guy coming in this movie and this is amazing because the air Spider-Man to every Spider-Man India Arie universe a fighting in the Doctor Strange just send it to know it is amazing.", "Honest review": "The movie is amazing, good storyline especially if you have been following MCU. The writers gave us fans what we were waiting for, to see the three Spider-Men is the same movie, that was really a wow!!!But i don't think the movie deserves to be in top 10 in IMDB all time movies, i still say Infinity War is better.", "Such a masterpiece": "Watts in this movie did something incredible and tom holland finally become a real Spider-Man and the acting in this movie was incredible he deserves an oscar.", "My only regret...is not seeing this in IMAX": "I'll keep this review short and sweet. A solid 9.5/10 from me.Warning: ***SPOILERS AHEAD***This movie picks up right where it's predecessor left off. With Peter's identity revealed, many citizens are divided between those who view him as a hero and those who want him incarcerated. And oh boy yhis movie certainly did well writing the story.There are numerous parallels between this movie and the other spider men movies that came before it. My personal favorite might be that we finally hear \"with great power comes great responsibility.\"This movie delivered. Had me cheering at least half a dozen times. Gave me several laughs. And guarantees the audience a story that will never be forgotten. Spider man No Way Home has certainly left a good mark on the MCU.", "Seems like director of the movie is a kid": "Dr. Strange made a huge mistake during his spell because SpiderMan was interrupting him, both were acting like irresponsible kids and here comes the whole movie.

The acting was the best it's ever been in the mcu with this one and I can't wait to see how the next movies follow up this one.", "the story its an excuse but the show is there": "The story feel weird and not very believable (peter parker helping ennemies?) but i need to say that the show was there and i really enjoyed all the scenes and i was very happy to see all the vilains together and all the spider man there. Very good surprise, some interesting revelations and some funny scenes. I enjoyed this Spider-Man and found it very good overall even if the story was just not logical sometimes but the story make happen some stuff that we couldnt have without it (all the vilains and the spiderman)", "How does this at best mediocre movie get so much praise?": "With a budget of 200 million $, can you shoot dialogues, that only rely on shot-reverse-shot?Can CGI somehow look datet, even while the film itself is new (good job forgetting a black outline from green screen in your end product)? On that note: can the arms of Dr. Octopus look more fake than the version from 2004?Can characters be both, incredibly unlikeable and also so stupid, that they forget, that a car has more than only one door?Can you make Dr. Strange and Spider Man not altruistic at all and act selfishly as they tell the audience, that they do stupid things, even tho they are already established as characters with completely different morals?Can you forget to pay your electricity bills, so that the movie doesn\u00b4t have any clear lighting?Can you cut the movie, so that the POV is in a different place every scene?Can the conflict of the movie, loss of privacy, be relevant in maximum 2 scenes, and then be completely forgotten? I don\u00b4t like, when you establish a thing, and then have that thing be there moments after. Can you instead do \"Into the Spiderverse\", but way worse?Can you put so much unneccesary stuff in the movie, that it somehow looses all focus?Can your actors look incredibly bored all the time and also don\u00b4t act, but instead just say lines? (I will give the movie credit for. Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, and Willem Dafoe, because those 2 were really great)I could go on, but you get the gist of it.Apparently you can, and people will love and praise it for some reason.", "Why do writers and the World hate SuperHeroes Now?": "Henry Cavill, the best Superman in my opinion, is no more.Chris Pine and his cast on Star Trek, the best I think, is no more.Chris Evans, the best Captain America, is no more, as is most\nof the Avengers.The studios involved, the corporate owners of the names, are\ndestroying a lot of childhoods and honest people trying to be\ngood in a time of extreme hate in our real world. Its ridiculous.And now they've done it again with Tom Holland as Spiderman,\nmaking sure there's not another. Marvel's trying on a Black\nCaptain America, and now as one of the charcacters said in\nthis movie, why isn't there a Black Spiderman? God help us - next\nis females taking male leads everywhere.

It shows how starved we are for good superhero movies;\nI wonder how many who paid to see this in theatres came out feeling\ngood?Another very sad landmark in American History.", "A joy to behold": "I couldn't help but smile through most of this film. There are some truly incredible moments that I never thought I would see and will live in on cinema. The story was also more emotionally affecting than I expected. They found a new spin on Peter Parker's classic conundrum of balancing his two lives and made it feel more important than ever. Even with the abundance of characters, Holland's Peter stays the main focus and his arc is executed perfectly.Willem Dafoe absolutely steals the show. He completely goes for it and his Goblin was genuinely terrifying at times. Alfred Molina is another highlight and the banter between certain key characters was so, so enjoyable to watch.Without going too much into spoilers, there are so many different avenues to shoot off from this film. The possibilities are truly endless and based on how the multiverse is being slowly expanded, there will only be greater surprises and memorable moments to come.", "It was fine": "I liked this movie, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself but I didn't feel like it was that good, it was good enough to have fun in but it had a lot of bugs that kept itching me. I am still not sure if its even the best Tom Holland/Spider-Man movie either. Probably on par with Far From Home? Because I haven't been a fan of Tom Hollands Spider-Man movies so far, they have always been so 50/50 with me on enjoyment, I think my problems with No Way Home (and the MCU Spider-Man movies in general) lays in my problems rooted in the MCU Spider-Man from the beginning.My main problems include the dialogue for the other franchise Spider-Man and villains, except Doc Ock and a little bit of Norman Osborne, everyone else just spoke very weirdly. Especially Maguire and Garfiend's Peter Parkers. Their introductions felt very off they didn't seem like the spider-Men I remember from the other movies. Also the action scenes were very jumpy, like I got dizzy a few times watching this movie, that might be my personal issues with motion sickness, but I never had this sort of stuff affect me in movies before, like the camera is constantly moving, I wish it would try and keep the action scenes more focused, I don't know if it was bad CGI and they were trying to hide by compensating but it hurt. There also felt like a few times where it felt like a scene was cut for some reason, like the Lizard staying in the van... we never saw why and for some reason he was there only mentioned that he wanted to stay in the van, for some reason.Also the comedy, once again, this is a Disney/Marvel problem but the comedy is ruining these movies, not that the comedy is bad, actual I do get a few laughs, but its the timing, the constant use of comedy to break a serious moment you are trying to let sink in. It feels like every time Marvel do this in their movies it annoys the hell out of me. Let the emotional moments sink in stop trying to jump in with the jokes, it doesn't work. Also there was way too much Ned Leeds. He is to No Way Nome was Kat Dennings was to Thor 2 Its unbearable, sometimes he gets laugh but he long overstays his welcome in this movie.Also good points, the action when it wasnt making me want to throw up, was very good, I liked the high stakes at just seeing all the villains and seeing Spider-Men from the other movies was pretty good and seeing everyone in the cinema get excited for Maguire was a feel good moment, despite my own personal issues with the executionOutside of that. Holland, is good as Peter Parker, the one thing that keeps me coming back to these Spider-Man Movies is Tom Holland, the romance between Holland and Zendaya is adorable. She may not be Mary Jane but she is great as her own character and I have fully accepted her, actually I liked her in the previous movie so she won me over long ago. But those two are the best.There are also other problems I have with the movie, but its just me ringing the same bells with the previous movies so I wont repeat myself. Otherwise a pretty decent Spider-Man movie that isn't the best, but it tries.", "Most hyped": "Most hyped movie of 2021 and it's deserve all the love and affection currently it's getting from audience , just wow\nI hv not watched yet\nBut no doubt 10/10 after knowing few spoilers \ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\udd25", "BEST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE OF ALL TIME": "Idc what anyone says but this has to be the best Spider-Man movie of all time like the acting the tension the buildup the fan service the actors and actresses my goodness idek where to begin and first things first I got to clap it up for Tom Holland Willem Dafoe Zendya Marissa Tomei Tobey and Andrew all did great in their perspective roles truly an amazing movie they really did Justice for Andrew and don't even listen to the bad reviews there not real spidey fans and they hate fan service how can u hate fan service when it's literally a comic book movie adaption like cmon now but yes like I said THE BEST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE OF ALL TIME.", "AMAZING!!!!": "I loved every single moment in this movie. I would say that this movie doesn't have a bad scene. All of the actors did an excellent job and the movie was great. The emotional component in this movie is great and it actually makes it feel like it's got bigger stakes than endgame. If I would rate this movie out of a 10/10 ratio I would rate it 12/10 definitely a must see movie.", "10 Out of 10, Absolutely, Indeed": "In Spider Man No Way Home, everything is literally amazing, spectacular, and stunning to the extent that I didn't want the movie to end. I didn't want to leave the theatre. I wanted more and more.The performances of the cast, without exception, and especially Dafoe's, are wonderful. Also, the movie made us live with, understand, and sympathize with Holland's Parker more (especially when his aunt died and the challenge that he'll have to face when his beloved one and his best friend do not ever know him now because of Strange's spell). It also thought us that the bad, evil, and villain does not need to be \"eliminated\". He/She needs to be \"cured\" from his/her evilness. Also, the person who is watching the movie can feel that it is about the coming of age story of Holland's Parker from being an arrogant teenager to being a mature human being who started to know more about life and its challenges and difficulties.The direction and screenplay in this movie literally have no flaws. When it comes to the direction, from the beginning to the end, and all the 148 minutes, everything was in its place. I didn't ever feel that there was \"something extra and meaningless that shouldn't have been put there\". Regarding the screenplay, I liked the way the film ended when Spider Man has to start from scratch now because of the spell that Strange has cast at the end. I also liked how the movie sets up many other Marvel movies in the future, like Doctor Strange 2 and other Spider Man and Venom movies.When it comes to the effects, the soundtrack, and the musical score, the effects (whether visual or sound) are excellent and astonishing. The CGI is unbelievably refined. The person who is watching can feel that the effects have been worked on really hard (especially in the part of the Mirror Dimension and the final battle). Regarding the soundtrack and the musical score, they are, at least to say, inspiring, sensational, and thrilling, especially when focusing on a particular Spider Man character and playing the music that was in his movies.The action scenes in Spider Man No Way Home are not only better than Homecoming and Far From Home, but also better than all Maguire's and Garfield's movies. In short, No Way Home carries the best action sequences the person can experience in a Spider Man movie to date.The last thing that I want to get into before I give my final score to this movie is the entertainment value. What I mean by this is that from the beginning to the end of the movie, the person sees new faces and characters like Daredevil, Strange, Doc Ock, Green Goblin, Electro, Sandman, Lizard, Spider Man (Andrew Garfield), Spider Man (Tobey Maguire), and the Rhino in a short easter egg. The person also gets the chance to experience the Mirror Dimension. Each one of these characters (and places) has his own entertaining experience (especially when he appears in the movie for the first time).Finally, what does the person want? An excellent story, excellent screenplay, excellent direction, highly satisfying performances, amazing action sequences, sensational and nostalgic soundtrack, a high dose of entertainment value, and most importantly, a Spider Man movie that made us look at Maguire's, Garfield's, and Holland's performances as Spider Man the same way. All of them are, at least to say, awesome. No one of them is better than the other. The three of them, when it comes to their performances as Peter Parker/ Spider Man, are magnificent.For me, all of these elements make a perfect superhero movie. So when it comes to the score, I gladly give Spider Man No Way Home 10 out of 10.", "Web of Nostalgia": "SPIDER-MAN.The name alone conjures up countless images, themes, and ideas. However, those ideas seem to vary depending on who you are talking to. With 3 widely different cinematic portrayals of the famed wall-crawler, there is no objective answer on how the character should be portrayed. However, when news began circulating about a possible team-up between the 3 Spider-Men, anticipation soared. Once the trailers showcased the return of previous cinematic Spidey villains, every Spider-Man fan completely bought in. What was once rumors and speculation about a Spider-Man alliance between Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland, had turned into expectations, and oh boy, were expectations high. Now that the film has released, does it live up to expectations? Does it accomplish the near-impossible task of satisfying all 3 fanbases while still delivering an enjoyable story? For the most part... yes!Jon Watts and the MCU's take on Spider-Man is not one I have been abundantly fond of up to this point. Homecoming was downright bold in its mediocrity, and while I enjoy No Way Home and think it was a step in the right direction, I can't say that Tom Holland's portrayal of Peter Parker ever felt right to me. This is not the Tom Holland's fault, as I think he is great fit for the role. The stories that he was put in simply were not fulfilling for a super-fan of Sam Raimi's original trilogy. I am of the opinion that Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 1 & 2 are among the greatest action movies in cinematic history. They are grand, operatic, emotional, relatable, and blissfully stylistic films full of rich drama, themes, and character development. To me, the original trilogy is the gold standard for Spider-Man / superhero movies. They weren't just great superhero movies... they were great movies (Spider-Man 3 is included in that testament too; even if to a lesser extent). I am certainly more a fan of cinema than of Spider-Man, so naturally I am going to prefer great filmmaking and directorial style over MCU-shared-universe episodic adventures (even if they are fun and enjoyable).With my anticipation through the roof as I walked into the theater, fear still scratched in the back of my mind. Unfortunately, the first quarter of No Way Home confirmed that fear. The start of No Way Home is jarringly fast-paced. We are given almost no time to breathe as one plot point rushes to the next without giving us proper time to completely emotionally connect with what is happening. The comedy is also extremely overbearing in this section of the film. It's that same cookie-cutter MCU comedy that we're all used to by this point. This section of the film also contains my least favorite scene in the whole movie. The scene is question is when Peter goes to Dr. Strange in an attempt to convince him to cast a spell that will make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. When Dr. Strange begins casting the spell, it all goes wrong, and he has to \"contain\" it before it is expelled. This is all fine, but the execution is where this scene falls terribly flat. First, Dr. Strange behaves incredibly bizarre and uncharacteristically in this scene. Next, the comedy is at its most forced and annoying. Finally, the way that the spell gets botched is very lazy and is also played for jokes. This scene should be absolutely vital, as it throws the rest of the plot into action. Instead, it's rushed and poorly executed.Thankfully, the film has an immediate spark in quality following that scene. The reintroduction of Doc Ock and Green Goblin is blissfully cinematic. It's difficult to contain your excitement once Alfred Molina recites his famous \"Sun in the palm of my hand\" line, or jump out of your chair when William Dafoe's animated cackle booms from off-screen and that pumpkin bomb rolls across the cement. The fight itself between Spidey and Doc Ock is decent too, though I wish we could've seen a confrontation with Goblin on the bridge, instead of Spider-Man and Doc Ock randomly teleporting to Strange's lair; cutting off the bloodline of a scene that was just starting to heat up.The returning villains are all handled very competently by the filmmakers and their performers. They fit nicely into the tone of this particular film, but do not deviate from who they are in their original movies. Some of the clunky dialogue written for them can sound a bit cartoonish and out of place, but the actors pull them off as well as they could. William Dafoe gives the standout performance from the villain cast, returning to the Goblin character as flawlessly as he had left him. I will say that fans of The Amazing Spider-Man movies may not be as pleased with this film's portrayal of their villains. Lizard and Electro both feel like completely different characters than they were in the 2 Amazing Spider-Man movies. Lizard is basically a satirical version of his original self and Electro is much cooler than the awkward mess that was Max Dillon in Amazing Spider-Man 2. I happen to think that the latter benefits No Way Home, while the former hurts it just slightly.The film goes on this pace until we hit a dramatic shifting point in the story; Aunt May's death. This is where the movie takes a turn from an average / mediocre MCU movie to something a little above and beyond. While I have never been a fan of the MCU's gimmicky version of Aunt May, her death is undoubtedly what the film needed to bring some well needed drama into the story, pushing the overbearing comedy out for good. For me, this is the first moment of the Holland era that has actually felt like it carried any substantial emotional weight. Holland's performance during and after her death is powerful, and it's the type of emotional gravity that I expect from a Spider-Man movie.Now... let's get to the most exhilarating part of the No Way Home experience. The 3 cinematic versions of Spider-Man coming together. Even though we were all expecting it, there probably wasn't a person watching who didn't have a huge smile on their face as Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire came through those portals.Let's get to what makes this dynamic between the 3 Spider-Men work so well. First off, Andrew Garfield might be the highlight of this movie. While I have never been profusely fond of the Marc Webb Spider-Man movies, I've always respected Garfield as an actor. Here, he's finally given the right script that he can truly shine in. He plays a jaded Peter Parker who has been completely consumed by his life as Spider-Man. Haunted with grief, Peter Parker is but a ghost to him. Garfield gives a performance with a great deal emotional weight, while also delivering on an abundance of infectious quirk. Tobey Maguire also does a fantastic job. His Peter is now an older, wiser, and sweeter presence. He's finally learned to overcome his darkness and to balance his life as Peter Parker and as Spider-Man. He's been through much of the same grief as Garfield's Spidey, but after a great deal suffering and struggle, he's come through on the other side a better man. However, in contrast to those two, Holland's Peter Parker is only at the beginning of his journey and is just starting to experience the grief that the other two Peter's have already gone through. Maguire and Garfield's Spider-Men know the possible darkness that Holland's Spidey could embark on if they don't steer him the right direction... if they don't steer him to embracing the core message of Spider-Man: Responsibility. This compelling dynamic, as well as the gold interactions between the 3, is what makes their team-up the best thing that No Way Home has going for it.The resolution of this film is also fantastic. Peter makes the sacrifice of making everyone forget Peter Parker. This is the best thing for this character. The Watts' Spider-Man era has been bogged down by its integral ties to the MCU. Without this, we can finally have a character that feels like Spider-Man instead of Iron Boy Jr. The final scene of Peter renting a crappy apartment and swinging out into a snowy New York feels like classic Spider-Man through and through out.Upon watching No Way Home, the realization that Watts' Spider-Man trilogy acts as one elongated origin story comes to light. Sure, the previous two films might have been more compelling if Peter had learned about responsibility. But, the origin's conclusion in No Way Home is also what makes feel all the more meaningful and important.Despite the many things that I loved about the movie, it is definitely not as perfect as many MCU enthusiasts have claimed. One of my big gripes with the movie that I am yet to mention is the lack of directorial style. I don't mean to harp on Jon Watts too much, but you don't really feel his distinct fingerprint on the movie that often. Stylistically, it pretty much blends in with the rest of the MCU. Visually, the movie is plain out boring to look at when it should be vibrant with visual flair and style. The action sequences are nothing too spectacular either. While the action is this movie is not boring or anything, it is certainly not as exhilarating or creative as it should be. The same can be said for the web-swinging in the movie. Finally, despite some emotion being brought on the table, it just lacks the soul and relatability of the original trilogy.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a little messy and not without its flaws. However, despite all the holes you may be able to pick in it, you can't really deny that it's a really fun adventure that gets a lot right. Most impressively, they accomplished the task of creating a true cultural moment by bringing all 3 live action Spider-Men together... and making it really work marvelously. No Way Home may not be perfect, but I'm happy to congratulate the filmmakers who achieved such an ambitious feat. No Way Home is grand, fun, enjoyable, and the best of the Holland Spider-Man films.8.5 - 8.9 / 10.", "My new favourite film": "Somehow surpassed my expectations.

I recommend every one to watch the movie as soon as possible. The making, choreography, vfx, acting, storyline.. No words....", "Boring and predictable": "I was very disappointed with this movie. Having enjoyed the previous two mcu spiderman movie I did not expect it to be. This movie picks up immediately after the previous one and depends so much on not only watching several mcu movies but also the FIVE pre-mcu spiderman movies it becomes almost unbearable. The story was ok for a crossover multiverse story of this kind but the script and acting are so weak and awkward it feels more like watching a random episode of a show in its tenth season. Like the actors are not into it and are just going with the flow. The whole movie depends entirely on big surprise moments to keep it going but almost every single surprise was known before hand thanks to trailers and internet buzz. I imagine even if you didn't pay any attention to any of that and tried to see it a second time it wouldn't hold up because without the surprises the movie has little to offer. And the few moments that weren't known beforehand online are entirely predictable, and feel very superficial when they're supposed to be dramatic and character changing. It's very weak writing.Not everything was bad though, Willem Dafoe does a great job as the green goblin as does Alfred Molina as Dr Octopus, but that's it. Disappointing overall.", "A comicbook fanboy's ultimate nostalgia!": "One of the Best movie ever made in the history of cinematic films! A movie that culminates an entire generation. A visionary film filled with emotion and nostalgia. A big large step up for Tom Holland Spider-Man's storyline.

But this movie forged his character into the best version of Peter, taking inspiration from both last history. A true masterpiece.

I would recommend it to all Marvel/DC fans because you will love it.", "We finally seen a competent, entertaining and satisfying trilogy for spiderman!": "Spiderman no way home review 7.7/10First thing first The villains in the new spiderman are okay however are no where near the level of Hans Landa, loki or the joker. I feel the main issue is the threat they possess to the spiderman crew and their motives. The best villain of the movie is Green goblin, an unstable ego maniac with the motive to eliminate spiderman whom he sees as a symbol of failure; this its self is a good motive but on screen he didn't seem like a threat to our hero's.After coming in expecting a steller ACT IV i left feeling like there should have been more to it. The climax (in my eyes) was a bit of a let down with The fight scenes in this ACT executed under par with very little back and fourth power control which makes the whole scene feel predictable and less engaging.Yet again we see the same old marvel problems arise with random kickstarters for the plot however In this movie it maybe the worst attempt i have seen in a while. The kickstarter of the plot is spiderman distracting dr strange while he is doing his spell causing him to mess it up.To see spidermans from different franchises come into the movie is intresting, unique and the execution for it is alright. The only complaint I have is for 15 minutes we are practically compering different scrips and gimmicks which causes slow plot progression in ACTIII. Filler like this can be done in an intresting way and fun way for example inglourious basterds rat speech however this wasn't one of those cases and within a few minutes feels tedious.As i expected with marvel the emotion scenes are absolutely spectacular, they know how to make emotion on screen without needing charector development or anything. Its absolutely genius.This spiderman movie is so fun and entertaining to watch (as marvel normally is) with the CGI and exhilirating gimmicks.The extras dialog and acting was a on the nose but i cant hold that against the writers.Overall i would not to skip on this as it is a unique and good wrap up to a decent trilogy.", "Marvelous!!!": "What a marvelous movie they were made. In one just fantastic to watch. It's gives the goosebumps when each and every characters enter into the the movie and gives nostalgic feeling. A perfect cinematic experience it was.

Cant stand this style of actings which I guess often comes whn you spend all your time in front of a green screen. Its a monotone whinning sound, like a bunch of teenagers trying to improvise during a stage play. Maybe they smoked to much pot the night before and fell asleep before they could learn their lines; alternatively maybe they are permanently trying to squeeze one out and theirs heads have been re-animate on top of new bodies. Spiderman was a really annoying character in this one and the plot was ridiculous, even for a kids movie. It would suit a remake of Care Bears the movie.", "They rushed this movie. It Could have been so much better.": "OK I'm not going to bore you with the plot details as I think everyone knows pretty much what happens in the movie. What I didn't like about this movie is how they rushed it.. I'll give you examples.. The way they introduced Tobey Maguire was so underwhelming. I actually liked how Andrew Garfield made his appearance. The way he came was unexpected. We saw a Spider Man running towards the portal and as soon as he came in, I thought hmmm is this Tom Holland. His costume looks abit different. Then boom he takes his mask off and its Andrew. I loved that part.. Now when Tobey came in. It just showed him appear with some regular clothing and there was no theme music, slow motion, dramatic entrance effects. I expected Tobey to come in with his responsibility theme but no it was just dead.Another part I thought they could have done so much better was when Andrew saved MJ. The way he saved her was again very underwhelming. He just casually catches her and lands on his feet. There was no theme, signature garfield background score. It was just boom they landed and its over. I liked the part where he cried after saving her but they should have done more of that..The whole reason I watched this movie was because of Tobey and Andrew.

It would have been so much better.", "Absolutely epiccccc": "This has got to be the most epic spiderman movie of all time .

The least interesting of the Spider-Man universe": "I just don't get all the fuss.This is a complex story driven by some weird concept of faux morality and CGI, for no more reason than a box office take.Marvel is supposed to be a comic world, it's not a world of social commentary, self-pity and self-righteousness. It's supposed to be Good guys saving the world from Bad guys, that's what the comics are all about, it's not complicated and this movie is way too complicated. \"Far from Home\" was a good example, clever... this movie is not.The whole idea of Strange trying to accommodate the whims of a teenager for no more reason than Parker wants to please his girlfriend and best friend... it's just dumbness squared.My advice is to \"Keep it Simple Stupid\", this too much like the nonsense that Disney came up with for the 3rd round of Star Wars, disjointed, confusing and too complex...", "Now where do I begin (NO SPOILERS)": "THIS IS A WORK OF ART it's amazing if you love marvel you probables have seen this already and you can agree but if your one of the people that haven't you must watch this\nNow if you have seen the trailers you will know that doc oc is back with green goblin they CGIED doc ocs metal arms which I though was going to be quit bad but it was spot on just to show you how detailed they put in this movie most of the set is a blu screen and it looks very real.

Tobey and the other old characters were really funny but as i said childish. The love affair between Tom and his girlfriend was very clich\u00e9, and honestly all the romantic scenes in the movie I had to try not to close my eyes. But it is worthy of watching {just one time}\nsorry if there is any mistake...English is my second language.", "Spider-Man: No Way Home Is Exactly The Big Screen Tonic You Need": "With great power comes great responsibility, uncle Ben had sagely declared, almost twenty years ago, in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. This is true for both, the superhero and the studio that has functioned as co-architect in his resurrection - Marvel. While debates about MCU films continue - Martin Scorsese famously declared that they are closer to theme parks than cinema - there is no denying that these stories and characters have permanently altered movies and movie-going. I'm thrilled to report that Spider-Man: No Way Home, the 27th film in the MCU, delivers an exhilarating experience. After the misguided Eternals and 18 months of a pandemic, it's exactly the big screen tonic you need.Read the full review on Film Companion.", "It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't amazing either": "The motivation behind the entire plot, \"We have to help them,\" was way too thin to be believable. I actually liked the idea of bringing the different versions of Spider-Man together and it was one of my favorite parts of the movie, but otherwise it just dragged. For how thin the motivation driving the plot and how long the movie was, I was bored. Too many long meaningful looks with dramatic music. It was disappointing considering all the ten stars. You can miss it and still see Doctor Strange 2 without needing to watch it.", "Deserves the hype; fantastic experience for Spiderman fans": "Doing my first review just to give this movie the praise it deserves. It has all the best elements from all the previous iterations of Spiderman. The action is stellar and never stale. The graphics are through the roof. And the emotion is as powerful as it gets.I understand some people don't like Tom Holland as Spiderman, but I have to disagree. He perfectly plays the role of a young man learning the true cost of being a hero. It is clear that Holland himself holds Spiderman's character in high esteem, and his presence only adds to the Marvel canon.If there's anything, and I mean ANYTHING, about this movie that I have to nitpick, it would probably be the inconclusive ending and the trivial role of MJ in the plot. A new character or villain would have been nice, too, but really, those details don't hold the movie back.Whether you're a fan of Spiderman, Marvel, both, or neither, I encourage you to give it a watch, especially with friends. It's a blast of a film.", "Not disappointed, but...": "I was surprised with the movie. I had some bad feeling about it when they revealed it to be about multiverse. I expected it to be a movie about Peter just trying to prove he is innocent with Daredevil helping him.Let's talk about the movie. I was surprised it wasn't just average movie. I wasn't disappointed like I was with Black Widow movie because of the way they massacred Taskmaster. Shang-Chi was good. Eternals was in fact boring, but I somehow found it better written than Black Widow. No Way Home gives us way better antagonists from another timelines of different universe and makes them more dangerous and gives Electro a better character and Defoe is being Defoe. CGI was cool and all. Peter got his development and instead of being Iron Man Jr. He becomes THE Spider-Man.Too bad ending was dumb and confusing. What about evidences that show Peter Parker exists?Still, it was nice to see Maguire and Garfield come back with Garfield saving Michelle which gives a redemption and overcoming of guilt.If there is anything I recommend you to watch from MCU films of Phase 4 by far, watch this.", "No offense but a lot of points come from just NOSTALGIA": "Movie is not good, imdb points doesn't make sense, most of people gave 10/10 which is almost impossible for any movie, all dialogues and script, plot came from old movie villains, there is no original mcu spider-man scenario, so %100 nostalgia, %0 original plot, there are too many jokes,spoiler:dr octopus is just ruined by jokes, actual villain was goblin, he is the only good villain, when tom holland hit his head he was laughing evilly, this scene reminds joker vs batman scene, it was great, one of the few good things about movie, dafoe's acting as a goblin is great, lastly spider-mans scenes are good in of terms of drama, but their fight scenes are short, 3 vs 3 fight is not enough, i was waiting for dr strange and goblin to enter 3 vs 3 fight. There is no surprising scene from movie, trailer and leaks are enough to understand movie, but for ex. Infinity war plot was surprising, trailer doesn't give spoiler in contrast to no way home, so i did not like the movie, because movie only rests on old villains and heros, nothing original, at least there must be original part.", "Perfect spiderman movie": "I loved everything about the movie, from the plot to the little details. Peter and MJ have perfect chemistry, and the villains are amazing as always. I watched it 2 times at the cinema and didn't get bored one minute!Even my mom that usually doesn't like mcu movies loved this one.", "Outstanding": "I couldn't fault the film, it exceed my expectations entirely (and I'm generally not a huge fan of the Marvel Universe as a whole). I deeply respect Tom Holland as an actor, and I think he is the true gem of the Marvel franchise.Andrew Garfield was a particular highlight, obviously an outstanding actor, and I hope he finally getting the recognition and acclaim he deserves for his depth in the role of Peter Parker (as the \"Amazing Spiderman\" films were not as well received).I watched the Toby Maguire movies as a child, and was also delighted to see the best of the old villains return. William Dafoe and Alfred Molina gave brilliant performances and have barely aged a day (in my mind anyway!)The whole nostalgic theme was of course fantastic, and delivered very well within the story. Huge kudos to the script writers for the plot.", "One of the best movies for both MCU and Sony": "Raimi's Spider Man was the movie that as a kid made me love both comics and superheroes. Andrew Garfield's movies weren't that good but I liked them for the story they were telling.And now Spiderman no way home made me feel like a kid again.I laughed, I cried, I cheered like crazy and I had a great time. It was like reading a great Spiderman comic book.I was so happy seeing Tobey and Andrew again as Spider Man and having interaction with each other and Tom Holland,and I loved the fact Holland's Spider Man went from being an Iron Man Jr to an actual standalone heroe.I can't wait to see what's next for Tom Holland and his arc as Peter Parker, and I hope we can see Tobey and Andrew again whether they are in their own movies or in an other Spider Man crossover.", "Spider man": "Spider-Man : No way home was the best movie ever but I think it would be better than the first spiderman movie. I think so everyone should s3 this movie.", "Best spider man film": "This was the best spiderman film and was the best film i have ever seen in a cinema, felt like the perfect spiderman film, it was full of action and bunch of sad, funny and cool moments.", "\"I'm something of a scientist myself\"": "Finally, a really great entry in the current phase of the MCU. It's become bogged down in the wake of the Infinity Saga. We had bland, unimaginative superheroes trying to replace people we came to love over a decade.Then, along came a spider. I can't quite remember when I left a movie theatre buzzing after seeing something special. There are genuine stakes and consequences. Drama that is played well and redemption arcs for not just heroes who never got a chance, but for some of the villains.It's not perfect, but the issues are minor, and Tom Holland's engaging. We pick up immediately after Mysterio outs Peter's identity. He needs to find a solution so he goes to see Dr Stephen Strange. Because, as pointed out during battles, Peter cannot control his mouth, things don't get fixed in the way intended. Previously this Spider-Man didn't face the consequences that other film versions have, personally or professionally. Now every choice has a consequence.Tonally this is the closest to Raimi's Spider-Man great power messaging.We have the return of some familiar faces, reprised by their original actors. These are good actors who can deliver great performances and have all grown in talent in the 20 years since some played these parts. And it seems like they turned up with that mindset here. Their characters are fleshed out further, and they maintain the characters as they were and are allowed to grow further. Andrew Garfield relishes his time and delivers a better performance than in either of his own films.Tom Holland is given a lot to deliver and pretty much nails the demands of the director. The script requires high stakes and delivers them. Benedict Cumberbatch shows his comedy timing, delivering dry laughs and some really great gags, you know it's MCU when they get the comedy just right. Alfred Molina delivers fantastically, and he said he was there just for the money. Well, the studio got their dollars worth. Willem Dafoe has chewed scenery in too many films. He is 100% committed here and absolutely delivers.The digital de-ageing looks good. MCU effects can be hit and miss, here they delivered. Jamie Foxx was hammy, but it's okay because he's surrounded by actors playing their roles straight. Marisa Tomei and Jon Favreau aren't just the uncomfortable couple they have been in previous films and help deliver moments of high risk and demands for Spider-Man.The score works well, I mostly don't register the music, unless it's songs I know, the effects are great. Too many MCU films are obviously on sound stages, and it's just a CGI fest. Here there are elements of practical effects that keep it grounded.Each villain is given moments, something other recent ensemble films have failed to do with stuffed casts. The final battle has a genuine payoff allowing one of the most scenery chewing actors to be regretful, compassionate then swinging to evil in the blink of an eye.Is this the best Marvel movie to date? Maybe not, but it leaves enough hanging to make the universe worth getting back into. Some threads are left hanging for Doctor Strange which will be worth watching as a follow up.", "AMAZING!!!": "Just Love it. Bring back memories and so many laugh and tears. Every scene still feels surreal and make me want to watch it again for a second or third time.", "Weak storyline": "There was nothing in the movie except the last two Spiderman Tobey maguire and andrew garfield. Weak storyline, long running time and too slow scene. Worst movie after endgame. Spideman far from home better than these.", "Strong Improvement from FFH": "Spiderman NWH has finally arrived and it didn't disappoint. Or did it? This film is full of fan service which is great at times, but can be too much at the expense of the villains. They were one dimensional and used for comic relief which sucks. Great pacing. Flew by real quick. I love the ending. It's about time Holland's Spiderman faces some consequences and experiences some growth. Love what they were going for! Sadly, it wasn't as epic as it should've been.", "Mind-blowing how this can be scored in top 200": "Awful writing. Cringe, soapy. The whole movie is a unfortunate sequence of dumb decisions. Characters are acting out of character. The whole time I could not get into the movie. It was just off. I could see Tom Holland and Zendaya but not Peter Parker and MJ. Zero chemistry in screen even though they are together in real life - I guess they could not get into it as well.Giving 5 for Tom's portrayal, effects and the 2-3 cool scenes.It is mind-blowing to me how anyone could give this above 8 and that as of writing this review, the movie is scored 8.3.", "One of the best movies in MCU": "This is a very good film. There are many surprising things in this film. This film gives us scenes that make us sad, happy, goosebumps, and make us scream.", "Fan service par excellence!": "I guess that if you are a huge Marvel or Spider-Man fan, this film feels like a wet dream. The film basically is one big fan service. SPOILER ALERT. It brings back five of the key villains and the two Spider-Mans from the previous non-MCU films. And it is not just a last minute gimmick: they are an essential part of the plot. It's great, even for someone like myself who isn't a big Spider-Man fan. Especially Dafoe and the returning Spideys impress. But the MCU Spidey regulars don't disappoint either! Tom Holland is good as always. Not just in the comedy or athletic parts (though he excels there) but he does a solid job in the more dramatic scenes as well. Everyone is performing a great act but I especially like the quirkiness of Zeydana. She is a natural beauty and a amazingly relaxed actress. But...for an average film lover the film on itself isn't that fantastic. Take away all the cool fan services and what remains is only a more than adequate superhero film. That is why I think an 8 is a perfect rating. It is an entertaining and fast paced film, but more fan service (done excellent) than perfect film.", "Best marvel movie of all time!": "Exceeded my expectations, my mind literally blew I kept cheering and my hands even hurt from clapping too much, hands down best marvel movie of all time!", "6 for nostalgia, otherwise 4": "Well there is no content in this movie. Almost everything fell flat for me apart from tobey and surprisngly andrew did a great job. Villians were just a side plot and reason for all this chaos is silly. CGI is cartoonish at times. Overall it will leave you empty after end of the movie and you will fill like wanting something new and exciting.", "Multiverse Fun!!": "This is easily tom Holland's best spiderman film with an OK primse of peter wanting everyone to not know who he is but where the movie shines is with the arrival of the villians with Williem Dafoe giving an amazing performance as norman Osborne / green goblinThe Final battle at the statue of liberty us amazing especially with tobey maguire and andrew garfield.", "Cinematic masterpiece": "This movie is fantastic and the idea of bringing back a cast from over a decade ago is phenomenal. When I watched this movie for the first time I got goosebumps this is definitely a part of cinematic history. This movie gave me feelings of happiness , sadness and disbelief I also mentioned about when I watched this the first I said this because I watched it many more times and it is just as good each time. Aunt may's death was done very well and shocked everyone when watching the scene. I liked all the call backs to former movies such as \" I'm something of a scientist myself \" and having Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man save MJ from falling to her death like Gwen Stacy did it The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Willem Dafoe played the roll of Norman Osborn ( Green Goblin ) excellently well and with his performance could also play a great joker in a few years to come.", "Disney's trampling of history continues": "What is it with Disney's obsession to rewrite Marvel history?Nobody must be evil, nobody can die, except for the sacrifice of the pure-hearted to some noble and lofty Christ-like cause.Inherited characters who conquered evil in the traditional way? Oh dear how embarrassing! Never mind, rake up the past and purge it of anything that doesn't fit today's ideology. If it makes the story nonsensical in the process, no matter.3 stars for great graphics, decent humour and the nostalgia of old faces.", "Very well implemented": "A lot of the MCU movies are feeling messy and this was a tad bit like that but not as bad as some recent ones. They executed the story line very well and I had to laugh at the very audible gasps on the cinema at some scenes. Great job team!", "Best experience ever": "I really cried When i see all my favourite actors playing their character after long time really it's very emotional movement for me this Movie is made for spiderman fans if you compare it with endgame of infinity war there are no comparison they both shows different events SPW is emotion for our three spiderman and their vilians the beat part of Movie is now we all know that tobey maguri is best Peter Parker ever and adrew is best spiderman and they both teach our tom the meaning spiderman and peter Parker so the ending of snw is beigging of our Tom Holland spiderman.", "not even a movie": "The plot of this movie is basically no plot. The way spider man meet each other and the way very villains suddenly regert barely make any sense. The rest of the plot is like a carnival rather than a movie. Things changes way too sudden, it feels like the screenwriter want to put everything togther without bothering to make a good connection.", "Nostalgia is no substitute for creative writing": "The plot promised to be more interesting than it actually was. In reality, it was just an excuse to shoe-horn legacy characters into the film.I think there were too many characters and they all had little screen time. Certainly not enough time to write a plot that makes you care about them.The supposedly funny riffing between the characters was painful to watch. I'm afraid this cast can't bring that jokey sparkle that we used to see with Chris Hemsworth, Robert Downey jnr, etc. Tom Holland is a particularly weak actor in comparison to those guys. Also, I think he went to the Liam Neeson and G\u00e9rard Butler School of Dodgy American Accents.The CGI was a tad mediocre too and the action scenes lacked excitement. Spidey looked too fake during action scenes. Has Marvel reduced the budgets for artists? Because this looks worse than films from 5 years ago. Having said that, maybe I'm just forgetting that Spider-Man has always looked a bit fake when web-slinging around the city.Despite my complaints, I didn't think this was a terrible film. Its a. Good film but no more than that. I'm probably giving it an extra star just for the nostalgia alone. But I'd prefer Marvel actually wrote some good character driven stories instead of using cheap nostalgia tricks. It's certainly not worthy of top marks, like a certain film review magazine in the UK gave it. Top marks would suggest it's as good as Infinity War, Endgame, or Civil War. This film is nowhere near that standard.", "Creative but final ending could be better": "Ok so Peter Parker's choice is for everyone to forget who he is but he remembers who everyone else is...so, he's going to reconnect with his girlfriend in the next film. So that seems lame. What if his choice involved Peter forgetting about his girlfriend too? That would have been the truer test for him.", "A well balanced mix of Nostalgia, Acting, Story and Redemption": "One of the absolute best movies Marvel has made so far. It's right up there with Into the Spiderverse and Spider-Man 2(2004).Awesome fan service, with a great story and some mind blowing performances. Andrew Garfield and Willem Dafoe definitely stole the show for me. Tom Holland was amazing as well.It's a must watch if you're a CBM fan, not just Spider-Man.", "BEST OF ALL TIME": "The best theatre experience ever.Tom Holland's performance was top notch.Watching all the villains was a nostalgic.And specially watching the other 2 Spiderman was like a dream, can't express in words.Andrew Garfield and Tovey Maguire you both have my heart.Thank you Marvel for giving this masterpiece.This was the best day of my life being a Spiderman fan.", "Maza aa gaya (Finally something enjoyable)": "*) K Reviews *) ( ( After sooooooo long i watched a marvel movie and it was a combination of my childhood and my adulthood cinema fiasco.

But mid-spell he confused Dr Strange by making special requests, and this opens up parallel universes. That's it, a super thin plot and half-baked idea that never goes anywhere. What a relief when the credits finally rolled. Such a shame, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie.", "enjoyable": "By far the most entertaining marvel movie i've seen in a long time. Kinda feels like the endgame movie specificly for spiderman. It is clear that spiderman is one of that francises that kept to a higher standard than other marvel enities.

Kinda feels like a reunion of sorts, wich was executed quite well.7/10: really good.", "Aaahhhh....Nostalgia...you beauty": "This is not a movie...it is a time machine that takes you back to the time when you watched the first spider-man movie probably with your friends or family members.....A movie complete in all aspects...from strong acting, drama, action, fan service...you name it and it's there...Marvel...Thank You...You have singlehandedly revolutionized filmmaking and managed to tug at the heartstrings of all the fanboys out there....", "I had to wait almost a whole day to process what I saw last night.": "Let's start with the spoiler free comments. This movie feels very different from the first two with Tom Holland. It's more mature, darker and the stakes are high. The comedy is reduced compared to the previous movies - which is a plus for me - and the jokes that are actually present are well-balanced with the rest of the dialogue and actually funny. Another plus is that Peter is not as reliant on technology as before. Yes, his suit is the same and it's high tech, but the viewer can focus more on the actual stunts.Now for the performances. Everyone did amazingly, but the spotlight goes to Tom Holland. He really outdid himself. I always knew he was a great actor, but this role never gave him much chance to show it - until now. Willem Defoe and Alfred Molina reprised their old roles effortlessly, though I did notice some slight changes but I think they are due to the whole feel of the movie rather than the single performances. Jamie Fox as Electro is much better in this movie, but it almost feels like a completely different version of Electro. He's way more confident. Sandman and Lizard are definitely secondary villains, even though they have their dedicated sequences.Some very spoiler-y comments from now on!I went to the theatre with very low expectations regarding Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's appearances cause I didn't want to be disappointed. I was hoping for a cameo of both, but I was convinced they would have 5 minutes of screen time tops. My mind was blown when they actually showed up around the middle of the film and stuck around until the very end! Seeing all three Spider-Men together was exciting, incredible, funny, moving - any positive feeling you can think of! The room was shaking, everyone was screaming and clapping when Andrew and Tobey passed through the portals. Being a part of something like this felt extraordinary.Nice cameo of Matt Murdock, but I was surprised to see that it didn't amount to anything. It was kind of left there.I was so happy to see that we were right about Andrew catching MJ and Andrew hitting the Lizard. A lot of the fan theories turned out to be true, but I was still surprised! The whole movie is packed of Easter eggs and references, and I love it.I would have loved to see a Miles Morales post credit scene, but I was glad they at least addressed him. I'm hoping the new trilogy will revolve around him.I was also surprised to see that Tom Hardy returned to his universe. I didn't expect they'd choose another actor to play Venom in future movies.At last, that ending left a bittersweet taste in my mouth and, yet again, I was shocked. The movie took a dark turn that threw me off guard. It feels like the end for Tom Holland's Spider-Man, but I guess everything is possible.There are probably more things I'd have to say, but I think this is a good review for now.", "Everything it was supposed to be!": "The hype was huge. The expectations even bigger.But it delivered. Big time!The action sequences, awsome. The cinematography,l beautiful.Nostalgia, funny scenes, suspense, great dialogue and good music completes this superhero awsomeness.Spider-Man is probably the only hero that his movie can feel equally big-if not even bigger- than superhero movies with whole teams like Avengers, Fantastic Four, X-Men etc.The movie is a perfect mixture of everything we hoped for, and then some more. It completes the trilogy smoothly and the runtime is full without falling off the rails for a single minute.Marvel set the bar even higher with this one, since it's probably a once in a lifetime event.After all this time and movies and it has the same feeling with the goosebumps you felt when you first saw the famous Avengers group up scene. Same with the reunion in Endgame.But you know it's a special movie in the Spiderverse, and it still leaves you feeling full and waiting for the next sequel which it sets the ground for.I watched the movie last night and my Spidey sense is still tingling!Thank you... Peter. ;)", "A fun nostalgic trip, but light on story": "Fun for now. Everything everyone wanted but once nostalgic embers burn out, will this film stand out compared to the first two?

That try to kill him several timesI just dont get it then theres too much humor going on & too much missing details and it just could have been way better. Sorry but anyone wanting to watch a good movie will not enjoy this one however any fan will definitely at least enjoy their time.", "Awesome film, I'm really commend it to watch": "Everything that every Spider-Man fan was hoping for, No Way Home creates a collision of continued MCU storytelling with pure nostalgic joy.Two and a half hours fly by as viewers are repeatedly hit with exciting reveals, in a film virtually impossible to properly review without spoilers. Simply put; a great (and mostly importantly, coherent) plot which has depth without becoming convoluted, the return of some of the fan-favourite villains, each updated without losing their charm, and an enforced investment from viewers.CGI and action scenes are brilliant, giving the likes of Doc Ock and Green Goblin the opportunity to revel in greater special effects. Plus the acting is just as good as it was nearly 20 years ago - Dafoe is superb yet again and even given the capacity to improve upon his previous goblin. Electro is hugely improved upon, stripping away the goofy style of The Amazing Spider-Man, and Sandman is kept consistent. Lizard still looks pretty stupid, but who cares. Honestly, the villains don't each get that much individual screen time, but there's so much else going on that it doesn't become a hindrance.It not a perfect film, but for someone who was a child when the original Spider-Man trilogy came out and has followed this character on screen since, it brings everything together, and is just joyful.", "Not as good as expected.": "With the mistake of listening to way too much hype, I saw this film tonight. It was entertaining and well-done. However, although I want to like Tom Holland as Spider-Man, I just don't buy into his character.Consistent with his weak character, we see Peter Parker instigate all of the destruction and death as a result. The storyline is all over the place and the inclusion of MJ and his best friend, who add nothing to this movie, are unnecessary.Seeing the previous two Spider-Men make an appearance was cool, along with older villains and Doctor Strange, but the main character, Spider-Man, was the least inspiring of the bunch.Well worth the watch but not up to snuff.", "A word of advice - research your film theater if 3d is good there.": "Apart from the spoilers which i dont want to say it's a must watch movie for every spiderman fans out there.But listen to me i got disappointed watching it in 3d it's like i had a flashback of Aliens Vs. Predator Requiem dark and blurry .I was surprised when the credits scenes had so much clarity in 2d which was a complete bummer.", "Great Movie that you can only watch once": "This builds upon the other already established past Sony Universes and encorporates them into the Marvel Universe. This Movie is low key predictable, but the expectations do not work against it.The story isn't good enough to merit a rewatch, but upon the first watch, this movie contains many things i love about Spiderman.Its emotional depth is felt in the parts that the movie needs you to connect too and the delivery is well acted. The villains are great as can be expected but i was disappointed by Sandman, they didnt do justice to the grapgics or CGI and the lack of Venom was something that bothers me still. I expected him to be playing a role in more ways than a cameo.The 3 spiderman work together and it was great to see them together. I was moved by their being anchored in the pain of Loss. Thou our Spiderman has lost what no other is suposed yoo or has lost thus far.Willem Dafoe shines as the Green Goblin and is the high light for me. The most memorable portion of this movie.The ending leaves room for further growth and development while giving a satisfactory ending just in case Sony and Marvel cannot agree ob a further movie.I am satisfied with the movie, but the movie just doesnt merit a rewatch.It is worth watching and i recommend it. Its the best one yet, well, not as rewatchable as the second one, but we are all allowed to love different things arent we?", "The Best Movie of All-Time!": "This Movie is amazing in so many different ways! I think the story is super good, and it's just such a masterpiece! The perfect 3rd movie. I also reallyliked the CGI. Truly the best movie of all-time!", "My new favourite Spider-man movie": "This is something that once you leave that cinema its stuck in your head for a long time like its literally all you can think about, its also a film that when it comes out on dvd you will watch it over and over again its so rewatchable and gets better everytime. Believe the hype trust me you won't be disappointed.", "Spider boy becomes spider man. Heartfelt, exciting, and nostalgic but lacks the stylish flare of Raimi's films": "This is how you do fan service! Old beloved characters were carefully incorporated into the plot and not just thrown into the last battle. I was surprised by how much care seemed to be taken with these characters. It was a pleasure to see them on the big screen again and not in a gimmicky way. This was by far my favourite in the MCU Spiderman trilogy.Andrew Garfield was a highlight, I didn't expect him to bring so much emotion to the film. This is also the strongest performance by Tom Holland in my opinion. We finally saw him take on some serious baggage and to see the other Spidermen emotionally support him was touching. This film actually felt a bit dark and gritty at times, which I do not associate with the MCU. I really felt like I was seeing a true character arc that didn't feel contrived. The writing in this film was pretty damn strong and packed a lot into this film.I felt that the direction did feel a bit generic at times but I loved the sequence with the trains and Dr strange doing his thing. I wasn't a big fan of the backdrop for the final battle, I thought it was a bit dark and dull but seeing the teamwork between the Spidermen was too exciting to be too annoyed. I must thought they could have done soemthng a bit more interesting with the scene. Some reveals particularly green goblin could have been more impactful too.The ending was amazing, seriously surprised me for an MCU film. The fact that Peter kinda ends up in a worse position after the movie but has grown into a man was refreshing to see. It gave me chills, can't wait to see this again.", "OK": "This really is just Ok. The scenes with the Spider-men were well written but there were many moments of nothingness. A great movie is in there somewhere.", "The best movie I've ever watched": "It was the best experience watching it on cinema. The cast was excellent\ud83d\udc4c. Also the CGI in this film was astonishing and the action scenes were amazing!", "It all comes together!": "This is Marvel Universe at it's best, DC Comics could never do this- how hard they ever try! The Man would have been proud, and hopefully he is looking down, R. I. P Stan Lee!!", "Keeping the MCU great!": "Since Endgame, MCU movies have been a bit all over the place in terms of quality. No Way Home is a welcome addition to the franchise, and if not for Into the Spiderverse would be the best Spiderman movie to date. I don't know how Marvel is going to handle their new multiverse direction, but it was extremely well done here, with plenty for the fans to love. Highly recommended!", "Go and watch this is great": "Don't watch the trailers. Just watch the movie. I'm not going to say much. It's amazing. And I'm in complete disbelief that it actually happened. Well-made, well-acted, well-directed. Fun, funny and crazy. Can't wait to watch it again.", "Weak story, big disappointment": "I waited months for this movie to come out as I knew it would tie together a big chunk of the Marvel Multiverse stories. I loved the idea of having multiple spider-men from separate universes and to see them work together.But...\nThat's about all there is in this movie. Peter messes up a spell being stupidly cast by Doctor Strange and some foes and two Spideys pop up. The end is extremely predictable, both in the ways the enemies are fought against, and in the way the movie actually ends.Technically speaking, special effects are just OK. CGI is OK, but a lot more attention should be paid to lights in the scene, as many characters look completely detached from the action in the background.Where this movie seriously failed to keep me at the edge of my seat is the moment when the 3 spider-men meet. This moment has been hyped for months, yet it only happens in the second half of the movie, and it's followed by a hour-long slow sequence (lab, scaffolding) that gets very boring very soon. Compared to the action scenes at the beginning and end of the movie, the middle section looks like it's been directed by someone entirely different (and in a worse way). Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield really fail to deliver a decent performance and, given that they both are good actors, this is very sad.I gave the movie 6 stars because it does indeed provide some story that ties in with the rest of the MCU in a way I like, but the experience of watching the movie is, at times, really painful.", "Ambitious concept, brilliant execution": "A truly wonderful installation to the MCU. Tom Holland's acting talents are on full display time and time again throughout this 2.5 hour journey. It blends the old, the new, magic, and good old fashioned pure heart. Bravo to those who played a part in this marvelous film.May we never forget.", "This Movie is unbeatable and unbelievable thrill and amezing unique story concept": "What I say to this movie I am not ever seen movie like that it's amazing and full of thrill and I am dame sure you never see movie like that ur whole life. So go And Watch this movie.", "Danger of spoilers": "Greatest film between Spiderman Films. I cried In many scenes of this film. My Childhood memories Were revived with seeing Toby and also Andrew. Villains had a great job specialty green goblin. In general, thanks to Marvel for creating this masterpiece.", "Yay it's a franchise": "This whole movie is a sloppy fan service to people who loved all the spiderman movies from the dawn of the millenium to right now. The story didn't make a lot of sense, but that didn't really matter, it was just about getting all the spidermen and spiderman's villians from every spiderman movie on screen. The acting was atrocious from basically everyone and no one took their roles with much seriousness. It's a mess tbqh, but this is Marvel not caring and looking for easy money, so it is what it is.", "Beautifull- For the sake of art": "The way every actor chose to play once again their former role un this amazing production with an amazing script (writters couldn',t do better).This Is a piece of love for the Marvel fans.", "A weak start but a strong finish": "I have watched the original Spider Man trilogy by Tobey Maguire when I was like 10, but not really Andrew Garfield's Amazing Spiderman. So I would say there are definitely parts that I won't be able to get if I haven't read spoilers and explanations before hand, such as Garfield catching MJ being a big deal.The part before the appearance of the main villains are average and somewhat OOC, and there are certain parts where you can't exactly think too deep before realizing how absurd some of the plot is. But the climax and the ending was emotionally impactful, and I have to say in a way it returns Peter Parker to who he has always been instead of the marvel image of Tony Stark Jr who is shadowed by his more powerful senior heroes and heavily influenced by Tony Start's personality.The fighting and swinging was okay but nothing particularly mind blown in Marvel's standard. In the technical department I would rate a 7.5/10, it did what you would expect it would do.Would definitely recommend if you have seen the previous 5 movies but if you didn't you might find the nostalgia and member berries not in sync with you.", "Good addition to the MCU and Spiderman franchises": "After so much waiting, it was good to finally check out this new Spiderman adventure. While I cannot say much without spoiling the plot, I do feel the storyline could have been much tighter than it was. The writing and plot direction seemed kind of rushed and all over the place a lot of the time. This was disappointing to me. Considering how long it took for the film to release, I think the finished product should have had a more polished and complete feel to it. However, getting to see all of the \"old but familiar\" faces made it a more enjoyable movie for me than it otherwise would have been. Overall, I think that Spiderman: No Way Home is a cool film. I didn't feel it was great but will still recommended it as a must see for Spiderman and MCU fans alike. (7/10).", "10/10 Recommended!!": "It was a really entertaining film! My entire family thoroughly likes viewing it, and it is unquestionably one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life!", "Weak American Movie": "Movie designed to pay off the Spiderman fan's nostalgia. Weak story. Simplified human relationships. Commedy designated to make kids laugh.Nice acting of older actors and Tom Holland did a good job.People please and a pop-corn movie.", "A near-perfect Christmas gift for all true Spider-fans.": "I say \"near-perfect\" because the first thirty minutes were tough to sit through. Especially the banter that was intended to be humorous (but failed at being same)!Things improved considerably, though, when the bad guys started arriving. Sandman, Dr. Octopus, and the Green Goblin from the Toby Maguire films. Electro and the Lizard from the Andrew Garfield films. And, last-but-not least? Spidey-Maguire and Spidey-Garfield, themselves!The three-way discussion between them was sheer genius. Kind of like a scene from the alternate time-line sequence in \"It's A Wonderful Life.\" Only with wall-crawling and web-slinging.And, of course, the show-down with the five displaced villains was suitably action-packed. The closest thing we Spider-fans have yet seen to a silver screen version of the Sinister Six!I just wish they had omitted the guy from the recent Venom sequel. His mid-credit cameo was twice as cringe-worthy as the first half-hour of dialogue! Thereby explaining why I did not give this a perfect ten.In short? As Stan Lee, himself, might have said: \"Have yourselves a merry little Xmas by going to see this, true believers. Excelsior!", "Incredible, emotional, perfect.": "Truly an incredible film. Top 3 marvel films for sure. So many twist and turns! Excitement, tears, joy, laughs! The full cinema went crazy at so many points which felt amazing. Great story line, with fantastic characters and their development. Would highly highly recommend.", "The Perfect Sequel of the Spiderman Franchise.": "It has everything that people would have ever wished for. The story starts from where Far From Home left it and then it takes it's own unique twists and turns to give fans every single thing they have anticipated. The movie also has tons of Easter eggs references that any Spiderman fan would love to hear or see about. The Characters play their parts to the very best. The visuals are stunning as usual. Marvel pulls out another ace into the hole. A must watch for every Spiderman fan, every Marvel fan and even every Comics fan. Nobody would be disappointed to see it.", "this was incredible": "This is probably the best marvel movie. The characters, the story, the cgi, everything was perfect. This is for sure the best 2 hours and 28 minutes i have ever spent and i highly recommend to watch. Trust me, u are doing yourself a favor.", "Creative and groundbreaking": "Many of us in the back of our minds might have considered the collision of universes of our favourite shows or movies. We've wondered and possibly fantasised, well this film went there and did it in a huge way. I was excited to see Toby McGuire and Andrew Garfield put on the suit and join Tom Holland. A spiderman from different time periods and they explained it using the multiverse concept but I was so excited to see so many barriers broken and everything tied together, fantastic. They even tied together their villains for a great showdown. If anyone could pull this off, it would be Marvel. You got to hand it to them, top marks.", "Wth": "I am 2 minutes in and I already want to shut this garbage off. Tom Holland is awful hes unwatchable. Its an extension of the last awful movie. I knew when people said it was good I just couldn't believe it.", "very enjoyable movie but": "In my opinion it's good very, very funny and very impressive, but they could make more, 30 min at least more, could use the villeins and make them look good and affect the movie.", "Must watch spiderman movie": "After watching the movie i couldn't realise what i have witnessed, there is no words to explain that feeling. This movie is just an intro to what we have to expect from the future marvel movies. Must watch movie don't miss it. This movie is spoiler bomb don't light it up. \ud83d\ude42", "Iron Boy finally matured into Spider-man": "Easily the best Spider-man movie in the MCU and probably the best after Raimi trilogy. Everything the fans wanted from this movie is delivered. The film is not perfect but the way everything came together makes every issue with it forgivable. A lot of long-awaited cameos and references made the theatre go nuts. Even though initially I thought the title of the film was silly and they used it just to have similar titles in the trilogy, they really earned this title by the time the film ended.", "Amazing and impactful": "When I left this movie I felt so great and so relieved. Everything I wanted to be in this movie and more was there. The sinister 6,all 3 spider men actors in the same movie and a long run time to cover everything.I was kinda shocked that the only death was Aunt mays but it was good because at the end when everyone forgets Peter she didn't have to go through that.Tobey Maguire and Willem Defoe still performed amazingly and Andrew Garfield as well as Tom Hollands improvement in acting.I only have a few problems like why they 3ushed the first half and why Peter went to Doctor strange to reverse time so casually like it was nothing. Also why was J. Jonah. Jameson in Tom Hollands world when he is meant to be in tobey Maguires world?", "I love MARVEL but hate SPOILERS": "Spoilers ruined my whole experience & excitement \ud83d\ude29Positives :-First, COMEDY in marvel style is back again with great humour.Second, ACTING done by each character is so good.Third, ACTION SCENES of the movie blend with VFX is worth watching.Fourth, the LANGUAGE is so simple, anyone can understand it. There is no use of any hard words.Negatives :-First, CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT is weak in some situations.Second, Some scenes can be CUTTED that can reduce the movie's length.Third, SPOILERS is the worst curse for marvel.Fourth, the ending is PREDICTABLE, there is not a big twist.", "Pure fanservice, pointless and weak": "This film only exists with the intention of repeating the impact of Endgame without having the same effort seeking only profit nursing the screaming fans of one of the greatest heroes. But in doing so, the film destroys such a skilled character as Doctor Strange, and delivers a tedious and drawn-out narrative just to present the moment so obvious that everyone expected it but pretended it was just a rumor. Unfortunately, Marvel isn't concerned with quality anymore, and fans will accept any treat, even if it's a disappointing story.", "The amazing marvel movie ever": "You must to see this movie in a Cinema\nWe want more movies like that.I love marvel movies\nI am very big fan\nFrom the first movie when the marvel cinematic universe started till this moment and i have a message to all the people that they will read this review that you must to see all the marvel movies because their are many amazing scenes that are coming soon \ud83d\udd1c", "Loved it.": "It was so good to see everyone's return to the movie, very nostalgic. Action packed, comedy, emotional.Aunt May won't be home, that's why the movie is called no way home, in my opinion.", "A very well conducted meeting": "\"Spider-Man: No Return Home\" is a collection of successes, well, it's true, the film has some problems, but they are completely forgotten after the climax we all expected, with a weak script and a very forgettable first act. From now on, it's pure spoiler.Until the appearance of Dr. Octopus we are seeing another marvel movie, with jokes, action and weak development, but from the point of appearance of Octopus, although the whole plot that brings its appearance is weak, it is very good to see a villain classic and spectacular how Octopus comes back to life, not just him, but like all the other villains, and it's amazing how Tobey's Spider-Man villains are spectacular and leave the others untouched.And talking a little more about the script, which practically creates and forces a situation to call the villains and the other spider men, from the moment everyone is gathered, although such a meeting could have been earlier, the script just hits, in the postures of each spider man, andrew garfield does a perfect act and tobey maguire has a unique screen presence, it's really cool to see Tobey back as spider, it's a childhood rescue and his enjoyment is good, both are used to finally transform the Tom Holland in a real spider man -better late than never- the loss of Aunt May is very well used, and the conversation between them flows perfectly, after a certain point everything is fan service, you really don't count on the history, fights, we just want to see the three of them coexist, three different eras.The direction as a whole is marvel standard, a lot of CGI and very common framing, the special effects are good but not impeccable, especially in Tom Holland's movements, finally, the film serves in addition to talking a little about the current life of each hero, many ends are closed, both Tobey and Andrew, especially the latter, buries tragic gaps from his past, it's as if everything ended up well together, and finally we can see Tom Holland as Spiderman. 8/10.", "Don't even know what to say": "I really love Marvel Movies... they are amazing.I also looooove Peter Parker... but this movie. I don't even know what I should say, this was the worst marvel movie I have ever seen. I am sorry...", "The best Marvel movie ever made!": "All the plot locations and characters were well thought out. It is impossible not to admire the minds of the screenwriters while watching. The actors dressed their characters so well that I was really impressed while watching it. As I mentioned in the title, this is the best Marvel movie ever made. Everything is very good and well thought out. Definitely watch it and make others watch it, you won't regret it.", "Awful, couldn't wait for it to finish": "A movie that is the wet dream of brainless marvel fans, filled with tiring and unfunny dialogues, plot like a swiss cheese, acting like in an amateur german adult film (except by defoe and molina) and waaaayyy to childish in its essence.", "The Best Spider-Man Movie Ever Made": "I've had a smile on my face the entire time watching it. It's the best Spider-Man movie of all time. I say this as someone who's been off the MCU hype train for quite a bit now. If it can reignite my interest in the genre, It's bound to give you a nerdgasm.", "A spectacular film": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is all-around great. One highlight is the star-studded cast, all providing enticing performances. In aid is the often perfect dialogue and fitting writing that does justice to the characters of multiverse past, especially in relation to the current trilogy's pre-established cast. Character development is therefore highly satisfying, the film sporting a fantastic emotional depth that is even supported by the solid comedic moments within. The emotional impact the feature presents is entirely heartbreaking, yet wholly fulfilling all the same. With so much to work out, the writing proves to be all around good. There are no dull or wasted sequences, altogether. Particularly, the placement of all the characters within the storyline is well decided. Momentum towards the climax is never lost, with shocking and exciting moments continually pushing the audience forward and deeper into the film. The resolution is highly satisfactory, showcasing the greatest strengths and flaws of each character. However, the first act and therefore the set up to what occurs is somewhat questionable. It feels as though this part of the film was rushed so the plot would quickly move into the more meaningful second and third acts. This ultimately proves slightly redeemable, though, upon viewing the spectacle that follows. Thematically, the movie delivers various meaningful messages that are completely developed and an obvious purposeful reflection of the Spider-Man character as a whole that the previous Holland Spider-Mans had been focusing into. As always with the MCU, visuals are captivating and the action sequences are suspenseful and intriguing. Editing and sound are additional highlights of the film, seamlessly weaving what happens into a logical, exciting storyline. Overall, the attention to detail in this film is wonderful. Spider-Man: No Way Home is an awesome feature that deserves much praise.", "Top 10 film of all time?": "Had massive expectations given the score it has received.Disappointed that the actual film is pretty mundane and trots out all of the old Spider-Man villains - who frankly are more Poundland than Waitrose compared to more recent offerings by both Marvel and DC.Some good bits but some sloooww and soppy scenes ruin the pace.It's basically a full length feature gimmick - using the handy multiverse (where have I seen that before in a Spider-Man movie?) concept to weave a story from old characters that no longer sparkle.This is not a classic unless you are a ten year old fan-boy/girl.Pretty average fare - expect that score to drop sub 8 once the hype dies down.", "It's good, but I was expecting it to be better": "I had really high expectations for this movie based off the reviews, but although it was nowhere near to being a bad movie, it was not quite as good as I expected. The problem was that the final battle scene wasn't that thrilling for me because it just felt like I've seen this in many other movies. Although it was good to see the other 2 Spider-man characters in the movie, I felt like I wanted them to have much more of an interesting and bigger impact on the movie. Overall this is a good movie, but I feel Far Frome Home was a bit better and is probably the best in the trilogy.", "Hands down one the best spiderman movies ever produced": "Some background before the review: My first ever superhero movie in a theater back in 2003 was Spiderman and since then I have had admiration for the web slinger. When Ironman released in 2008 my admiration gravitated towards Tony Stark / Ironman and he is still my favorite. After watching No way home I realized my life and the Peter Parker's life has come to full circle.This is one of the best Spiderman / superhero movie made over the Years. Story, Screenplay, Acting, Music, VFX. All the departments have done their job well.It's a unimaginable vision brought to fruition.", "For me a 10/10 however maybe not for all...": "I am a long time spider man fan I grew up on Toby Maguire I have also watched every spider man film multiple times and have seen every project marvel and co have put out so far. However my dad has not. Although he enjoyed the spectacle and action he did not come out of the cinema with the buzz and thrill I got. The film is fun for all but I feel only truly a 10/10 experience if you are a real fan so don't be surprised if you find this movie doesn't match your expectations!", "Multi-verse concept": "Really nice movie, for a Marvel fan you have to say that the multiverse concept has worked. I like that they have utilized actor shift with this concept. It's simply ingenious. You don't understand the movie 100% if you haven't seen previous Marvel movies in the spiderman world, among others. But that has to be the downside for a non-Marvel expert. But from me, top rating.", "Best Spider Movie Since 2002's Spider Man and 2004 Spider Man 2": "If you like Spider Man, you will LOVE this movie! If you like Marvel Movies you will LOVE! This movie!

But, personally I'm not Spider man fan. So, I believe it was made only for Spider fans, which are really as many as Deadpool fans.Some scenes are not making sense for me and some other are good. About the ending, I love it but it's sad. I love the way entry of Doctor Octopus into Peter Parker (Tom Holland)'s world and battle of three Spider mans and their villains. I was both sad and angry about May's unfair death. Personally, I believe it's Spider man's fault and responsible for May's death. He stole Doctor Strange's magic multiverse cyber to help his alternate villains, but then they battled Spider-Man as thanks for his stupidity. And then May died for Spider's fault.However, it's ok film.", "Awesome movie..": "Marvel studio please complete the series of spiderman and the amazing spider man make spider man 4 and the amazing spider man 3 spider man i have been watching every movie since childhood and have seen every movie many times i even count I don't remember and after watching Spider-Man No Way, my curiosity has increased and I want to see Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man costumes osm movie is no way home Old memories are refreshed Viewers must watch this movie.", "The best movie ever made.": "Looking at IMDB rating with many rating this movie a 10!

I can't even trust the ratings on IMDB anymore. Right now it has a rating of 9.1, no way is it better than The Dark Knight. Just because you love the movie and it got you all excited, doesn't mean it's a perfect film.", "\"Say the line, Bart!\"": "No Way Home is easily the best of the three Jon Watts Spider-Man films. It doesn't reach the emotional depths of the Sam Raimi movies - few superhero movies do - but it tries at the very least, and that's the greatest thing about it.This film is not a lazy, nostalgic cash grab. Anyway, Marvel knew they couldn't recast Willem Dafoe; his Green Goblin is one of the iconic movie supervillains, and that character is still associated with him in the public consciousness. (Sorry, Dane Dehaan.) I wish people would think of MCU movies more like comic books. There are crossovers, alternate realities, retcons, and lore that can be hard to follow. There are also moments of beautiful humanity expressed with drama worthy of life-or-death situations, and No Way Home hinges upon one in particular. Also, if you're lost within the MCU (or outside of it, which is where this film ventures), just Google it. You don't have to watch 20 movies. That's a ridiculous criticism; it's amazing that they're able to make these movies connect as they do. Maybe a few feel too transitional or lacking in independence; so are many comic books.I digress. Through foolish optimism, Tom Holland's Spider-Man almost allows bad guys to destroy the world. There are real consequences to the actions of this young college student and, in the end, he makes a decision similar to that of Tobey Maguire at the end of one of his films. It will not last. Spider-Man was not meant to live in misery. He was meant to live with persistence, with the superheroic ability to learn from his mistakes. In No Way Home Jon Watts finally stops trying so hard to be \"cool\" and lets Tom make those mistakes, and he learns that \"With great power, there must also come - great responsibility!\" courtesy of Aunt May this time.I cried like a baby when I saw Tobey. I never thought I'd see Bully Maguire on the big screen again, but there he was - older, wiser, and still \"trying to do better.\" It's not Iron Man (thank goodness) or even Aunt May who acts as Spider-Man's mentor here - Tom's Spidey is becoming a man, and he must learn certain things for himself. ...He cheats by learning from other versions of himself. Andrew Garfield warns him of the risks of blind anger. Tobey reminds him of a great many things, but he has a hopefulness that Andrew cannot have. Both are like older brothers; they believe in Tom, they care for him, and their performances are so great that it feels wrong to continue the whole \"Who's the best Spider-Man\" debate. All of them are great reflections of the same character who is meant to act as a reflection of all of us - our struggles, our failures, our fears, and our potential. Watts gets a little afraid of Andrew's darkness and opts to start making fun of him, but hey - it's great that Andrew's there at all in his depressed glory. The angry, isolated Spidey is back, and I didn't realize how much I missed that side of the character.Beyond its emotional intensity, this movie is slick like other MCU entries. It's also funny - these Spider-Men have great banter that's true to character. The character was always funny. This time, the humor means more; Tom needs it to get through the chaos that surrounds him, and the jokes are, for the most part, cleverer. They're less mean, too... most of them.No Way Home is also worth watching for the most brutal and well-choreographed superhero fight scene this side of Sam Raimi.", "Best movieeee all the time": "Im see movie and i love .

Very strong performances by Zendaya and Jacob as well, you can really sense the true friendship the three of them share. The return of the most iconic villains in the franchise history also provides some awesome fan service.My one and only complaint is I wish the trailers did not reveal as much as they did, they did not need to show all of the villains coming back prior to the movies release. They should have kept it more under wraps, but I get it, they wanted to sell box office tickets. Go see this in theaters to experience this special event with everyone!", "Nothing Original in this Remake": "Not only is there nothing original in this made-from-the-template sequel, there's almost no story at all.

This movie was so satisfying to see, as it was a very nice love letter to 20 years of live action Spider-Man movies.The movie also had a pretty good Spider-Man story and really elevated Tom Holland's Spider-Man to another level.

Love from Pakistan \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\uddf0 .I'm big fan of spider man comic animated cartoon & also spider man Sam raimi trilogy this movies gives me goosebumps after 1st half I can't explain my feelings once a life time experience .....", "\"An absurd Fan-service of emotions and speculations carried out!\"": "\"Spider-Man: No Way Home is the biggest film by Marvel and (mostly) the title character because just like movies in this genre (of super heroes) they can live up to expected expectations, because everything that connects the characters, villains, antagonists It's not just mass with the various references and possible connections within his own universe and Spider-Man, but the maturity of the character with its due and respective problems and consequences that this time he will have to solve alone will be the great triumph!", "Brefing": "So much brefing an detaling in the movie and in the starting of the movie it take so much time for coming the action scenes.And from my point of view there is also a little bit short role of dr Steven strange in comparison of tom Holland as spider man.", "Not at all what is was cracked up to be": "Just bad. Bad script, bad story, the movie was just a fail. Jokes not funny, annoying scenes...... Waaaaaay too long. Really, there is not much to like about this at all.How did this happen?", "Amazing, Spectacular and Ultimate all spun into one": "No Way Home was really good. It was funny and energetic, while also equally emotional at times. I would say it is higher up on my personal list than Spider-Man 2 as to where I would rate it as far as favorite Spider-Man movies go, which is saying a lot. Sony could have never come as close to setting up any sort of \"Spiderverse\" of villains or sinister six in a film had it not been for Marvel, its producers writers and their obvious care for the source material over a paycheck.", "Fans are gonna be Fans.": "This movie was worse than homecoming- Peter acts like a 5 year old and is stupid all the time. Just because toby and andrew came back, doesnt excuse all of the plotholes and the bad storywritting. But fanboys/fangirls and hype is gonna push any movie thats mid at best. Peace.", "Great assembly": "Plot is a bit sloppy, however all 3 spidermen are amazing, Garfield and Maguire are stealing the show when on screen, they got better chemistry towards the cult hero, than Holland in general. Looking forward the next installments, as long as these eternals and shang chi or marvel and stuff are accompanied by the \"classic\" strange, guardians and thor movies, MCU can still be really well done and enjoyable.", "ONE OF THE BEST SPIDERMAN MOVIE AND MCU FILM\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\udd25": "If you are MARVEL FAN then you will cry at last truely\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\nSpiderman at it best one of my favorite spiderman movie.# marvel\n#spiderman.Uehdjdkdndkeoejeirjrjrornrjeoekejfnfkfjf.", "A cool adventure through the multiverse": "Awesome set designs, nice action sequences and an interesting dive into the multiverse of Spiderman make this film a solid watch. This film certainly takes a different angle with exploring Tom Holland's darker side of Spiderman, which I thought was actually quite a refreshing take from the light-heartedness of the previous Spiderman instalments. It was also nice to see MJ and Ned develop as characters since Homecoming, and of course the special effects were top notch throughout.Overall this is definitely one of the strongest MCU entries of recent in terms of character development and story. 8/10.", "Marvel Studios back with a boom": "However i can describe this movie as the best movie i saw in 2021 for sure. And it cannot be replaced by another one. Especially i got thrilled when 3 of the spiderman joined the battle. And the moment i waited for was the Dr ottto Octavius and it was fascinating. Well it was a worth watch movie. I got satisfied with my money for the ticket. Go on guys no negative reviews are frank. In my opinion its the best Marvel movie ever.", "Weak screenplay and story, but enjoyable.": "To be honest, I love far from home more than this. I was highly expecting for this movie. Although, I was really happy for Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. Their parts too were weakly written. The climax and some parts of sinister six are weakly written. The scene where goblin smashes his mask was a marvellous try but, Raimi would have killed it. It wasn't that surprising either. Anyways, the movie was quite enjoyable.", "Enjoyable - spoiler filled": "Key plot points were weak. - The mistake in the spell.The world breaking blunder in somehow bringing dead people alive. Then the equally bizarre \"cure\" to fix them else they die in their real universe makes no sense. These villains are all dead in their universes, so sending them back to their reality will still mean that the time line there is beyond their death, so they die.Despite these basic errors, the movie was very watchable. Great performances from the returning stars especially from William Defoe. The visual effects were be. The music was suitable.", "Rinse and repeat Marvel movie": "Overhyped without a doubt, just a rinse and repeat Marvel movie from a franchise that has brought absolute gems such as Infinity war, Endgame, Black Panther and Doctor Strange movie's.Entertaining but nothing special.", "Lives up to the hype while staying true to this trilogy's DNA": "Basically there's everything you expected and more (hello Daredevil!). It somehow manages to stay true to the lighter tone of Tom Holland's previous Spiderman movies, while having very dramatic moments (I cried like 4 times...) gearing him towards a darker new trilogy.Having Willem Dafoe as the main villain was very smart. His acting is absolutely top notch (as opposed to most of the other villains, mainly Jamie Foxx), and he carries the movie on his shoulders.The references are everywhere, it's obvious fan service and it works, that's what you want from such a movie.I'm glad they stayed true to the original spidermen and didn't try to make them cooler than they were. I cringed hard during most of their scenes together for how lame they were, but it made so much sense with their personalities that their interactions would be cringey.I can't wait for the new Dr. Strange now!", "Here comes the Spider-Man!": "As a Spider-Man fan from Tobey, Andrew and now Tom, I couldn't be happier. I didn't see any leaks nor trailers which made me go blind for NWH, I was surprised with everything in the Film. Couldn't explain how happy I am. As Spider-Man film goes this is one of the best Spider-Man films, everyone's performance was truthfully the best and thanks to everyone that worked in this film, they should all get an award.

It's a cutesy-wootsy over emotional love letter. It's Spiderman 3x3.That being said...you'll see it. You'll enjoy it..whatever.Highlights. Doctor Strange. Matt Murdoch cameo. Happy Hogan's phone call about what he is seeing on his apartment cam. (Best joke in the film by a longshot.)Lowlights. Jamie Foxx. (Jamie Foxx was aweful is ASM2, and he is still aweful...No one wants to see an actor trying to play \"cool\". It's cringe) Sandman and Lizards original actors being edited in...very lame, both actors have this sort of CGI 2 second appearance with their real faces) Too much...no WAY TOO MUCH crying. Especially for the not Tom Holland Spidermen. Come on guys...you've had years to work it out...Not enough Matt Murdoch. Should have been given a few more scenes. I don't need him in Davedevil costume to be satisfied, but let's get a little more than 2 minutes.Anyway. It was a noble effort. I'm a little offended for DC who technically created the multiverse BEFORE marvel. (Flash Thompson's book in the movie is \"flashpoint\". Well...Flashpoint is the Flash story that began multiverse in comics) .. It feels like Marvel jumped over DC again here. Using their original idea and beating them to it (as The Flash movie with Keaton's Batman still isn't out). Can't blame Marvel/Sony though.... They've got a cash cow to milk.Now....let's see what they do with Venom. Will Hardy's Venom be meeting Holland...Or is he going to meet A drew Garfield? (Rumors). I'm gonna side with Holland. Garfield is fine, but he is a Solo Sony Spiderman. HOLLAND has MCU ties and we need Agent Venom in the MCU. Who knows? Just no more crying spider-dudes.", "Iconic spiderman movie": "This movie is one of the best spiderman movies. The beginning to the middle of the film is pretty boring, but the scenes and scenes after that are iconic! This spiderman movie is helped by all the characters that appear in each scene! It brings back childhood memory! The reason why i didn't give this a 9 or 10 is because i quite hate the peter parker's tom holland character here, because i don't know some of the scenes he plays in this movie are a bit confusing and the portrayal of him playing clumsy characters is not suits for spidey character in marvel, but overall a really good movie! Good work!", "Best spidy movie ever": "I'm going to be honest here. I went to see the movie only because I wanted to prove the fan theories if there were going to be more than just Tom's spider man or not because the sequel was kinda not hitting ? (but ngl it was obvious that there is going to be more than just 1 Spider-Man actor but I refused to believe so I would get surprised and also so I don't get really disappointed if Toby and Andrew didn't show up). I know that a lot of people hating on Tom's Spider-Man but after this movie you'll love him for how he portrayed Peter out on this. This movie made sobbing the whole time and also really satisfied. I got chills every SECOND of it there are a-lot of scenes that will leave you want to scream til you loose your voice if you are emotionally attached to Spider-Man movies. The whole movie was incredible but I would say that the cgi could have been better but it's understandable because it wasn't done until the release date as they clarified. This movie is incredible !!!", "Blinded by cameos": "The cameo appearances(and there are a lot) is blinding everybody watching this. I've been dying to see Spiderman 1 cameo's and a continuation of that story forever, it was my childhood movie. But the plot, writing was so generic and uncreative, not to mention Dr strange pulled a plot rabbit out of his hat every time he needed to move the plot along. It also didn't help that the story involved peter parker, who is a grade A student and scientist on par with characters from the big bang theory, but is not a genius capable of creating cures for every villain that work instantly in less than a week. I also hated how the movie relied on old famous lines from the old movie or how they tried to break the 4th wall and joke about the villains back stories a lot. The drama and seriousness that I love in movies was all gone and replaced by cheese characters that I found annoying(this is the first time Holland Spiderman movie I've seen) and horrible scripts for my beloved childhood. It was entertaining at least, but the whole fight was chi anyway I couldn't really tell what thwas going on anyway. I did like the villains being a hit different but I think they could've cut a lot of stuff out and given the villains more screentime so they had a reason to be eveil, its like they were evil for no reason.", "I witnessed cinema history": "I don't know how to write a review for this so here we go.THEY GAVE US EVERYTHING..\nTHEY ALSO GAVE US MUCH MORE..THIS MOVIE WAS FOR TOBEY\nTHIS MOVIE WAS FOR ANDREW\nTHIS MOVIE WAS FOR TOMTHIS MOVIE WAS FOR US.THANK YOU SONY/MARVEL <3-a fan that grew up with Spider-Man.", "Not entartainng": "Quite a boring movie. There was no interesting script. Same old stories , over and over again. Save your money and watch something else. Totally wasted my time.", "wow Amazing movie": "This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman.", "Very well made with some story problems here and there.": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is a very enjoyable movie that I saw with my friend and his family a few weeks after opening night. My friend had already seen the movie and told me it was the best thing to happen to superhero cinema in a long time. I enjoyed the movie, but not as much as expected.First of all, the actual production value of the movie was excellent. The acting, VFX, etc. Was very well done. The only real problem I had was some story and tone issues. When I watched this movie, I had not watched Spider-Man: Far From Home. My friend had told me most of the major story points, so I didn't feel like I had to watch it. This movie starts basically right where the last movie left off with Spider-Man's (Tom Holland) identity as Peter Parker being revealed to the public and being seen as a murderer of Mysterio. The opening scenes of the movie show Spider-Man being berated by the public about the \"murder\" and reveal of his identity. The tone of these scenes is very dark and claustrophobic with the feeling of Peter being trapped by the public. However, in the next scene, Peter picks up MJ (Zendaya) and a pseudo-happy song begins playing, shifting the tone quite abruptly.As an ironic fan of Venom (2018), I was excited about the post credit scene, but felt the execution was not on point. According to exposition set up earlier in the movie, the spell cast by Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) \"malfunctioned\" so that all Spider-Man villains who knew his identity were brought to the Tom-Holland reality to find spider man. Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) had no idea of Spider-Man's identity, nor anything else about Spider-Man, as the Venom duology take place far from NY. Thus, it makes no sense why Eddie Brock would have been brought through realities. This problem is shared with Electro (Jamie Fox), who didn't know Spider-Man's identity either.Bringing it back to things I enjoyed about the movie, the action was superb. All of the fights are fluid and exciting with barely any stale moments. The bridge scene was a great reveal of Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) from different realities being transported to the Tom Holland reality. The Doctor Strange fight stood out to me the most. With the fight taking place in the mirror dimension with Strange having full control, it lends itself to some spectacular and trippy visuals. Despite being very abstract and out-there, the fight is still easy to follow and a blast to watch.To address the positive elephant in the room, yes, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield playing the Spider-Men from their respective movies was an absolute delight. Some of my favorite scenes were just all 3 Spider-Men interacting with and playing off of one another. I was a bit skeptical of Andrew Garfield showing up in the movie given the lackluster quality of the 2 movies he starred in. However, he really stole the show and gave it his all in an amazing performance. Due to this, however, Tobey Maguire did not do nearly as much to impress me, despite me liking his movies more than the Andrew Garfield and occasionally Tom Holland movies. He was still great and had a lot of funny references to his movies.Overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a pretty good movie.", "Not what the reviews reflect": "However high the score may be, this is not worth any grade above 4.It's 100% fanservice with completely improbable situations, decisions and motivations. It has some great and bad cgi (ofcourse always too much). The only thing i actually liked was the acting of Toby and Willem.I cant call any Marvel movie a great \"movie\" anymore. It follows the same formula, humor and tone by default. It's just old popcorn over and over. Disney doesn't care about great story's, scripts or serious dialogue. All scenes HAVE to contain some bad jokes, muh diversity actors and questionable motovations. This is for kids of max. 12 years of age and nothing more.", "Amazing movie, or fan-service?": "After seeing the movie 8 times the fact still remains that this is an amazing movie as well as an experience. My first viewing of this film was genuinely one of the best, at certain 'moments' within the movie the entire cinema cheered, it was honestly amazing.The acting in this movie definitely ranges from being some of the best acting performances in a live action comic movie, to being quite mediocre. In particular, Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina's performances were amazing as always.I was going to write a long review but im just going to update this one later.", "The bestg MCU movie after endgame": "No words to describe what the movie is. A nail biting experience through and through. Every second has you on the edge and my oh my what a second half. I can watch it on loop for days together. Best spiderman movie and a very close second to endgame.", "Hello Peter!": "Amazing... Finally all those reboot's has a meaning. This film is for the fans. The music, the action, the story... Everything is good. Willem Dafoe's acting man... This man outruns everybody. And finally we got a Spider Man we deserve, not an Iron Boy.", "Teenagers Movie": "Everything went good until multiverse opened i feel like they made anything for finishing this movie, there is no respect for billions who watched and love old Spider-Man.And this without saying a mistakes of direction, performance\nIt's Shame actually this movie on top 100 in rating list.", "Couldn't be better": "Went to the movies for the first time since the pandemic hit and boy it couldn't have been better experience. A fitting and superb tribute to the whole Spider-Man franchise as well as an emotional reset to the current one within the MCU.", "EPIC!!! MASTERPIECE!!! BREATHTAKING!!!": "Everyone shall experience those moments as the epic saga comes to en end. The movie is simply the best movie ever made by Marvel/Sony. Everything is perfectly put at their places, like nothing is much or less, cast, audi-visual effects, CGI, storyline... This is a movie that you won't want to blink twice in order to miss anything. Thank you for the great work...P. S This supposed to be funny movie insted it made me cry my tears off..", "Very, very good movie": "This movie in my opinion is very good, it was an excellent way to finish the trilogy that was also excellent. Needless to say, the appearance of the 3 spiderman blew my mind. Everything went well in this movie.", "This movie is Super Spicey": "This is the best marvel and Sony movie i had seen. This movie was worth Waiting I was waiting for almost 1 year for this movie after spider man far from home.", "They Understood the Assignment": "Movies like Spider-Man: No Way Home is why we go to the theaters. To have our emotions unlocked, unleashed, and rewarded.The hype for this film was so intense I was afraid the film could not deliver. So like Zendaya's character MJ, I lowered my expectation to protect myself from disappointment. Well, let me say...there is nothing to fear because Sony and Marvel Studios deliver perhaps one of the greatest superhero films of all time.To those that hate superhero films...no one cares. This. Is. Cinema.I'll leave my review at the trailer level. Peter Parker wants the world to forget he was Spider-Man and enlists the help of Doctor Strange to help him. Peter Parker's penance for talking during Strange's incantations creates a rift that unlocks villains from past Spider-Man films.And before I go any further, let me say that the people who have criticized the MCU's Spider-Man trilogy are probably eating their words right now when they realize how much his super-powered friends enhance the stories that can be told. The freshness of Tom Holland's world brings a special joy to the interactions between his world and those of multiversal Spider-Man foes: Doc Ock, Green Goblin, and Electro.On the surface, the film feels like any other Spider-Man film, and then the story explodes, and you are not ready for the adventure that comes afterward. There are so many surprises here that remind you why you're a Spider-Man fan and a person who loves going to the movies.Spider-Man: No Way Home is the Christmas present we all needed. And my packed AMC IMAX crowd was united. And it felt good to be an American enjoying one of America's greatest comic mythologies: Spider-Man.", "Marvel salad from hell": "It impossible to accurately describe this mindless reunion of spider men and villains, randomly thrown together in a chaotic, plot less, clich\u00e9d train wreck. I'm leaving after 2 hours and there's 30 more minutes of noisy witchcraft go.", "I love it": "I loved this movie so much, I probably will buy it right away on Blu upon release. And to give you a hint of how much that is to me: I don't really buy Blurays anymore due to the convenience of streaming and of ALL 27 MCU movies, I only bought two so far. The rest, I can watch online if I feel like it. Most are forgettable, anyways.", "Best spiderman film so far!!! *spoilers*": "I haven't felt this emotional watching a film at the cinema in years. This is an absolutely incredible film and has so many beautiful moments. Seeing all of the spidermen together was fantastic. Tobey Maguire's spiderman was my first cinema experience of a superhero film and seeing him back again made me so incredibly happy. Andrew Garfield's spiderman was also brilliant, and his redemption dive made me cry so much.The villains were all amazing, seeing Doc Oc and green goblin again was also incredible.I was so excited waiting for this film to come out, and I am so so happy that it lived up to the hype.", "Best marvel movie of all time": "I have never rated any movie for 10 stars, but this movie deserves it. The special effects were mind blowing. I feel many goosebumps during the movie, as I didnot expect most of the things. I won't give any spoilers. One who have given bad reviews must be a looser in his life. Every bit of seconds of this movie were amazing. The best spiderman movie ever made till date.", "An extraordinary concept, but by a short-sighted reason": "I have to admit I am disappointed after all the hype and the good critics of this movie. I had high expectations. What I liked about the movie was that it had some good moments, great CGI, and the include of the multiverse. The concept of the multiverse itself is fantastic, I think. It can tell infinite amounts of stories.Anyway, in this movie, I think the appearance of the\nmultiverse is caused by such a poor reason - Peter Parker and Doctor Strange's formula accident, just like Tony Stark and Bruce Banner's accident with the program Ultron, in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). This is a short-sighted consideration of the protagonist, and that is a big problem, in my opinion. I know Parker was desperate, but when the whole world is getting into a risk because of one man trying to fix his difficulties of his reputation, and some kind of threat or danger to his, and only his, family and friends, Parker gives us a better reason to see him as a not-worthy Spider-Man.The movie is using three (!) spider-men, and it gets such a high value, because it's an extremely rare case to include three actual Spider-Man actors. About how they meet, I wish there were less of the long conversations, and rather more surprises between them in the middle of action scenes.Without thinking about the formula accident, the movie is quite exciting most of the time, and it contains big moments with iconic characters which make the movie quite special and unique. Unfortunately, there were no twists, and I expected the use of the memory spell, as well. The fight in the end is typical and clich\u00e9, in my opinion, which also made the end predictable.An ok movie, but I think it wasted some of its potential.", "the best part": "One of the most interesting and intriguing films I've seen in the last few years. I was surprised by the ending and the appearance of actors from old, beloved parts of the spider-Man world. I can say that this film will be among those that I want to review.", "Spiderman: No way home.": "Awesome fantastic good movie. Peter parker,mj were good on this film. Dr ocatvious stealed the show. Awesome fantastic good movie. 10/10. Tom holland is a awesome actor.", "Mishmash knockoff of Into the Spider-Verse": "No Way Home is a movie that probably cost 5 times as much as 'Into the Spider-Verse' but only comes across as a cheap knockoff with writing that would be considered lame in a backyard kids amateur theater night. Where Spider-verse felt fresh and zingy, this one is an mix of awkward scripting and corny dialog. Some of the VFX trickery is great but on the whole it could not stave off the boredom.", "This is what a superhero movie is": "I loved every second I was watching this movie, all I can think of is that Richard E Grant quote when talking about The Rise Of Skywalker - \"I cheered, I shouted, I fist-pumped the air, I cried, I stood and cheered. It's absolutely everything that you would hope it was gonna be.\"It perfectly summarizes everything that I can say about this movie, so I'll leave you with this advice - go watch this movie as soon as you can, you will absolutely not regret it and have an amazing time.", "LOVE THIS FILM": "So many expectations, so many hopes and merged photos. For any fan, the new part of \"Spider-Man\" is always the main release of the year. So far, films with Holland's participation have not disappointed, but they have not jumped to the bar set by Sam Raimi. Did Watts manage to create something more, or is there really nothing except references in the film?The continuation of the Spider-Man saga captures us at the moment when \"Far from Home\" ends, at the moment of the opening of Spider-Man's identity. A friendly neighbor is caught up in a storm from all sides: the authorities accuse Mysterio of murder, and society turns into a crowd of paparazzi and does not let Peter breathe even at school. In an attempt to stop this madness, the spider turns to Doctor Strange, but the oblivion spell does not work correctly and instead of everyone forgetting about Parker's duality, portals to the multiverse open from where our old acquaintances come.The main thing you need to know about the end of the new trilogy is a movie made by fans for fans. The creators even make up memes that they came up with based on old paintings about a spider. Such a balanced balance of humor and drama, as in this part, it is difficult to remember anywhere else.A huge number of characters in this part works both in plus and minus. On the one hand, it gives the viewer a lot of emotions from meeting old acquaintances (in some cases, the hall turned into a mini stadium meeting a favorite performer) and an excellent opportunity for a metashoot, on the other hand, it decently overloads the plot. John Watts tried to balance the film by introducing the characters gradually, thereby increasing the timing of the picture, and in fact he managed not to slide into mincemeat of constantly changing faces and jokes. The middle of the film, however, slightly loses momentum. There are a lot of climactic moments in the film when you have already cried all your rivers, and you need to cry another scene again.Do not think that the film is bad, this is fundamentally wrong. The middle, which has sunk in dynamics, is the only negative that can be detected at a glance. \"Spider-Man: There is no Way Home\" reveals all the signs of a great blockbuster, which has cool music (even classic themes from old parts), and great action scenes, and most importantly, it has a soul. A film in which the world can collapse at any second, and Peter goes crazy before our eyes, brings kindness and human relations to the fore. So, a little schizophrenic episodes with doppelgangers give Holland's character a development that he seemed to have missed being in the Avengers. He became a hero, but he didn't learn how to be Spider-Man. Now Watts has corrected this misunderstanding and has done it in a truly brilliant style.", "back to the childhood": "I squealed like a girl when they all showed up.The greater the power, the greater the responsibility.Spiderman is the most popular comic book character. And so the movie \"Spider-Man\" was already doomed to success. And so it happened. The film collected an impressive amount and it must be said that few doubted it. After all, this character is known all over the world. In addition, \"Spider-Man\" is considered one of the most \"high-profile\" films of 2002. So it's safe to say that Sam Raimi made an amazing film.", "It's okay": "Expectable Plot. You need to look over some real logical mistakes to enjoy this one. A lot of cgi. None of the streets you are seeing is real. I don't think they produced only one scene outside of the studio.", "It was close to the word \"BEST\"": "It is a fantastic movie that will give goosebumps to every spiderman fans as well as marvel fans!

Disney is ready to tear down any literary character and his motivation along with the key idea to make money. It has neither a solid plot, nor dialogues. Moreover, action scenes at the level of a black widow or Venom 2. Now because of this film I'm going to avoid Disneys content .", "Awesome movie, Awesome action, Awesome nostalgia.": "Wow! This movie felt like more of an origin story for Tom Holland than any others did. I felt he truly became Spiderman now that he had the \"with great power comes great responsibility\" talk and he meets Peter parkers who have experienced his struggles. The chemistry between them was amazing and it really gave Andrew Garfield a chance to shine since his movies were not the best. Overall, an amazing movie, especially the second act, with green goblin seeming truly terrifying and ruthless.", "Best visuals, with bad writing": "This movie had a Pretty bad plot. It was just fan fantasy. They went on adding everything fans asked without some thinking behind it.Fun to watch, but just too many plot holes.", "overly marvelized like the others": "Spiderman has been, until now, a unique story with greater character development than other marvelized stories, especially those done by Snyder, who is all special effects, no character. This latest has been destroyed by the same special effects that has ruined the marvelverse.

This is simple the best way to link them al together...From Daredevil to Spiderman to Amazing Spiderman to Venom...what else can you hope for.", "The bar was set way too high!": "Yes it's a good movie, if you're a marvel fan boy like me. The acting was good. In particular Doc Ock and Green Goblin. However I wasn't blown away by the storytelling. It's worth a rewatch for nostalgic reasons, but it's not in the same league some of the standalone MCU movies and not even Tom Holland's best performance as the masked vigilante.", "Hope this is the last Spider-Man": "What a load of rubbish! Hard to start writing a review of all the non-sensical stuff in the movie. I genuinly hope that this is the last of Spider-Man, it feels like they are trying to force too much into a movie and it created a cacophony of nothing.", "Very Fun Movie": "I enjoyed this from start to finish. Definitely can see myself watching it many times over in the future.I was blown away in the theater. The roaring crowd brought me back to what it felt like watching Endgame opening nights. Definitely a very rare experience that only Marvel has seemed to pull off since 1977's Star Wars. So that in itself is very admirable.Though I rate this film a 10/10 for the experience I had in the theater, I'm not going to rate the film itself on the adrenaline rush built up by an enthusiastic crowd. I'm taking a big step back and judging the story itself here. I'd give this a 7.5/10 (IMDb doesn't allow decimal increments lol). Far far farrr from bad but also not quite Oscar-worthy.", "I FEEL REWARDED": "I grew up watching Spiderman ( Sam Raimi's). He is truly my HERO. I used to spam the trilogy on my VHS weekly. I had a problem with the other two though.Adrew's lacked impact.Holland's rash and unexperienced.But oh boy this movie doubles down and CRYSTALLIZES my views on all spiderman's.I feel REWARDED.It shows how every spiderman is unique in his own way.Tobey's maturity and experience\nAndrew's humor and meta self awareness of underacheivment.Holland's inexperience and how he is still growing up.It draws a COMPLETE picture!It makes all of them damn likeable the way they are. It made me learn to stop comparing and accept change.This movie hits a homerun on all my dopamine levels. It knows how to be\nfunny\nserious\nsad\nangry\nand\nmost importantly\nCINEMATIC.SUPER GRATEFUL to have had this experience.MUST WATCH!", "One of the best movie": "A thrilling experience to watch. One of the best movie from marvel last year it's worth the time.Good story line and exellent screen play and plot and the cast was doing an excellent job and nailed it.", "Satisfied": "I'm very happy to 3 spidermans on the screen, After comics I show first time spidermans visually, Thanks to the hole crew members, technicians and tamil dubbing artists...\nU are all made my day...", "They took the risk, it's flawed but not bad": "4 dimensions of 3 different multiverses is quite hard to handle with. With so much space, time and people on screen, it's quite hard to balance the moments of action, fantasy and emotion and also deeply explore each one of them.It's a film full of cliches and even though some were thoroughly annoying, I felt the objective here was to correct/explain some mistakes made by previous movies - which they did.In the end the movie has a very simple message, and it's nothing new. The movie doesn't feel lengthy at all, but the highlight of the movie is 90 minutes wait so that the cinema can explode to joy with the flashbacks of their favorite Spider-men. In a way it's kinda disappointing to say this, but the movie itself isn't great if you take the emotion of Spider-Man watchers seeing all 3 together.The plot is a good idea, but the movie felt shallow. Even Aunt May's death was so overly explained that it wasn't as emotionally fulfilling as it should. And if you hadn't watched previous Spider-man's, then you'll be on the dark about most lines, scenes, villains (who are barely explored for who they are here), and really the movie will be just an ordinarily long marvel superhero thing.What I mean is, I mostly enjoyed the ride - as Spider-Man fan. If I have to go with my neutral side, it's got a few unsurpassable flaws which wont help but ruin the movie for some. As balanced as I can be, I'll give this Spider-Man a 7/10 + the joy of rewatching Tobey and Andrew with the suit.", "Absolutely Amazing": "Just saw this, and this would be one of the Must-See, if not THE Must-See Movies of the Year 2021. The Tom Holland as Spiderman Movies has been pretty good, the Characterizations, Storytelling, etc. Are excellent as usual but what makes this one extra Special is the Premise of the Plot itself.I would put this one as one of the very best or my Favorite Superhero Movies of all time, right there with X-Men: Days of Future Past and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. I would break down the Movie into around four (4) Acts:WARNING: HEAVY MOVIE SPOILERS AHEAD\nThe First Act would be Peter Parker dealing with his newfound Fame and Infamy, how it affected him and those who were close to him, and eventually how he dealt with it.The next Second Act would the Spiderman Villains as they were the first to come out, and here Alfred Molina, Willem Dafoe and Jaime Foxx shone very brightly, I was transfixed by them together onscreen and interacting with each other. They were simply amazing.The Third Act would be when the other Peter Parkers or Spidermans came out, and here they absolutely went to Town with what it would be like with them being together. Like for example the talked a lot about Toby Mcguire's Spiderman was able to generate the Spiderwebs from his Body.Or how about Tom Holland being able to fight Aliens in Space while Toby only got to do that on Earth, while Andrew Garfield wasn't able to do any such thing at all.The Fourth Act would be of course the ending, which is actually a bit dark and sad, but it is how it is, and how it should be.Overall, I think the Movie did a couple of things, first would be give Tom Holland's Spiderman a very, very, very graceful exit from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Second is that it also allowed Toby and Andrew to say their goodbyes for their Versions of Peter Parker/Spiderman, something which didn't happen before.Moving forward, it seems that there is a future of the Venom Symbiote in Tom Holland's Universe as a hint of it was given in one of the End Credits. Also they allowd Foxx to talk about a \"Black Spiderman\", so we might see that sometime down the Road.Anyway, if you haven't seen it yet, I would encourage you to go watch it, it is a Must-See for me.", "SOLID four out of ten stars ;)": "I'll be honest. I was entertained. The acting was good (especially Toby) and there were some fun action shots. It started in a way that was kind of unique/ fun. I'll even admit that I kinda enjoyed the buddy-buddy between the three Spider-Mans. BUT. It wasn't actually much of a story, and I felt nothing during all the climactic emotional moments. And that is kind of a glaring problem.In a way it was the best possible outcome from a \"committee-written\" or even \"machine-written\" movie. It reminded me of Star Wars 7. It was like they had focus groups where they asked comic book movie fans what their favorite parts of the Spidermans were. Then they threw all those scenes into one move. It's kind of like the next level of remakes. Now not only are we remaking the original movie while tweaking the plot a little and changing the actors. We are literally remaking exact scenes from earlier movies with the same actors, then stitching those scenes together with magic or whatever. It's kind of genius. It also kind of sucks.Other complaints- kind of a glaring plot hole that Tom Holland- if he was just going to forcefully inject all the earlier super villains- should have just left those super villains in their impenetrable magic prison box things and just injected them while they were in there. Much less risk of civilian casualties, I'd say. But I guess Aunt May said they \"did the right thing\" so they must have done \"the right thing.\" Also kind of weird how the hero is forcefully \"fixing\" people by taking away their powers/ injecting them with some sort of permanent anti-psychotic thingy. Seems like this used to be something villains wanted to do in these sorts of movies?? And can medicine really cure our world of evil and turn all the baddies into nice versions of Doc Oc?Anyways, those were my main thoughts. Fun movie though, thanks for making it. Just hope actually good movies come back someday too ;)-", "This is Amazing": "The emotions he experienced were enormous. Yes, the movie was for fans, but I'm a fan too. Other than that, Andrew and Tobey were with us again, which even made the movie great.", "Hands down the BEST film in the franchise since the Sam Raimi trilogy!": "Spoiler-free review in just a few words:This film is a love letter to the franchise and the fans! It has something for everyone! The direction, story and acting were so good that it almost felt like a modern take on one of Raimi's classics. You will love this film whether you are new to the Spider-Man franchise or not. It's one of the best films of the year in my book!", "Andrew is hot!": "What an awesome way to close the spider man trilogies. The way this movie was conceptualized is breathtaking. I can imagien the hours that the writers burned just to tie everything together. I love Tom Holland, but Andrew Garfield stole the show! Love you Tobey, but Andrew is sooo hot!", "A Marvel Movie with Consequences!": "This movie takes everything Marvel is great at - cinematography, building a universe, humor, etc. - and adds so much more! It's more than just an action movie, it's a well-constructed story where you can feel that the actions of the characters actually make a difference and lead to consequences, both good and bad.As a result, this is one of my favorite Marvel movies, and it held up very well on my second viewing. Beautifully made film, and I highly recommend!", "A must see": "I hate spoilers, so I wont, but this is a 10/10 movie for Me, absolutely loved it. If you haven't seen it, get to the cinema now, if you are not a Marvel fan then what the hell are you reading reviews for ? GET TO THE CINEMA.", "Its a Solid 8 film...": "For me it wasnt out of the world great 10 out of 10..its a solid 8.. I wish we had more of Andrew and Tobey to be honest instead of more villain screen time I want more SpiderMan screentime..Apart from that it was alright solid film..", "Another Marvel Movie...": "Maybe it's just me, but I am tired of movies where I'm expected to be emotionally invested in a scene after witnessing copious amounts of unfunny jokes in previous scenes that have been done thousands of times over. Throughout the course of the entire movie, I felt like I was watching a comedy drama sci-fi with no sense of actual danger or having a personal investment for the characters whatsoever.The only upside I see to this movie would be the special effects and a mediocre fight scene and reunion from previous characters.... And people just eat it up...", "Marvel-lous": "All the action adventure, comedy and pathos expected from a classic Spider-Man film. However we now have the nostalgia and uniqueness of multi Spider-Men in a cleverly constructed multiverse\nFantastic film.", "The best Spider-man yet!": "Easy if you ask me what is the best Spider-man movie ever I would say No way home. It has Andrew, Tom, and Tobby all in one movie and they have Docter Strange, and Five villains. IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE YET GO WATCH IT ITS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.", "INSANE": "The movie was insane. I can't believe everything that happened. The feeling of just being in the movie theater with all those people, all those emotions, and know that all of you feel the same way. The cheers and clapping from everyone in the right, perfect moments. The laughs, sighs, gasps, sniffles. The \"wtf\" looks you give to the friend beside you. It is definitely worth watching.", "Misdirected talent": "There is plenty of talent behind no Way home as there is only great performances and there is some really amazing ideas in this film however this movie is a huge mess. The first half is very strong and there is a turning point in tone that I really enjoyed however by around the end of the second act this movie takes a huge dip in quality. It's very obvious the latter portion of this movie was rushed as it feels very half baked. So many plot devices are being thrown at you that the story can't help but feel convoluted and blatant holes in the plot start to set in. Not to mention this movie tone switches like someone who's bipolar. As I said I liked the initial tone switch however it lacked consistency throughout the rest of the film so it made it hard for me to take this movie seriously. This is a competent film and I do think there is an amazing movie buried underneath it's messy plot, I just wish they would've spent more time to really flesh out the narrative they were going for as it would've made the movies ending far more satisfying. I should mention I didn't hate the ending I just felt it didn't feel earned and a very obvious plot hole stuck out to me that made it feel far more disingenuous.", "Just wow just wow": "After long time I go to watch movie in flim Hall and I watch spider man no way home. It's best hall experience movie every moment you enjoy. Don't focus on loop hole it's just made what fan want so i would ignore all loop hole. You will scream loud, cheer for every entry of villans their moment, fight and especially when 3 spidy appear. Just go your near cinemas hall and watch its a hall material so you should experience this moment.", "Amazing but a little less than what was in mind": "Good effects and plot but I find the Ending a little bad.they could have done an army of spider men vs all the villains we saw in the purple cracks. But you can't argue with tobey maguire.", "Just a filler for the multiverse concept": "Easy to predict the story right when Octavius and Osborne showed up. The way Aunt May dies and passed away is not emotional unlike the older Uncle Ben plus Aunt may feelings from the first gen spidey movie. Something is off right from the start. Spider-Man should not be used just as a filler to build the multi-verse story. He is the main character for gods sake. While Loki is given a main story-line and AAA character like spidey is just given a filler story just to erase or cure his presence among the people is just so bad and makes me fuming. And To add showing Eddy and Venom doesn't real cause enthusiasm as even it's predictable. Don't just add another filler in a year or two with those two top characters Marvel. Either drop or move on from the characters if you don't know what to do with them.", "Great finale to the a trilogy": "It started off mediocre but when the multiverse men appeared it became good. All the villains were made better by their appearance in here; especially Dafoe, Molina and in some way they made Foxx's Electro an really fun character. It also made the other two Spider-Men even better, I personally always loved all the Spider-Men equally but they all brought a different part of Spider-Man to life, Tobey brought the mature grizzled side of a Spider-Man who's been doing the superhero job for close to 20 years, Andrew brought the side of Spider-Man who has to bare the pain and suffering of the death and betrayal of his close ones and Tom brought the side of a young Spider-Man learning that he has to sacrifice his personal life for the greater good and h never being able to sustain a double life. The way the movie ends off really sets MCU Peter for amazing college trilogy.", "YES!YES!YES! 20/10 stars!!!! Spidey is back & better than ever!!": "OMG!! OMG!! OMG!! I don't even know where to begin! Incredible story, writing, acting, plot twists, background scenes, all of it! Tom Holland delivers as usual!! SPOILERRRRR! I screamed like a true fangirl when Tobey & Andrew made their appearances!! Marvel did an excellent job of keeping their characters hidden from spoilers and that made for a true plot twist reveal. It was a truly amazing fan moment to see my childhood Spideys back on the big screen!! The dynamic between Tom, Tobey, and Andrew is unparalleled. This has become my all time favorite Marvel movie EVER!!! I fear nothing will be able to live up to this for me. Don't get me wrong, Marvel has done an excellent job, as always. Especially with Phase 4, but I think it will be very hard to top this one. I would give this 20/10 stars if I could! PLEASE GO WATCH THIS!! IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD! YOU WILL THANK ME LATER!! :) :) :) :)", "Stan Lee is smiling in the light realm": "I feel like Stan Lee's energy was intricately woven into this movie like a dna strand. I couldn't help but think of him smiling and looking down on us so proud.This movie really blew me away which I knew it would. I'm so impressed how much \"nods\" they got in there to all the Spiderman movies. I think they did them all justice. Make sure to stay for both end credit scenes. The last ones really juicy.", "Spider Multiuniverse": "A few years ago we would never have thought to unite three films in one, and already in these times of the \"Multiverse\" it is a fact!Excellent and entertaining movie.I loved that the three actors from the biggest Spider-Man movies wanted to work together and that they got along very well, it shows that there was an excellent chemistry between the three.Very good story.Even oneself remembers those times when we went to see the other Spiderman movies separately.Excellent movie!The plot is very well focused.I loved the detail plans, each actor has been taken care of. And they have all been! Norman Osborn's son was missed but in the plot of the film he had passed away.You can see it many times and you don't get bored, and as time goes by you will see it again and enjoy it!", "So overrated": "Spider-Man has always been my favourite, this was drawn out rubbish, The story line could have been great but there were so many holes in the plot, pity half the cast didn't fall in them never to be seen again. They should have pushed the button after the first hour and saved us all grief.", "Good but could've been better": "I love the movie. But they could've extended it beyond 3hours to develop each characters story further for a more enjoyable movie. They could have showed us something interesting from both Tobey and Andrew world. The first half of the movie was the best after that it seemed like they were rushing to end it.", "(Real rating: 5/10) - Marvel have lost it!": "This movie is one of the worst movies of the MCU. It is the culmination of a bigger issue in the MCU. They have stopped caring about the essense of movies, in this case superhero-movies. What made a superhero movie was a fight between good and evil, a rational plot, characters with both dark and bright sides and potential for development. Spiderman NWH forgets it all, and just throw empty plot and empty characters at your face and \"steal\" peoples money to make a profit.The plot is based on a mistake, which happen 30 ish minutes into the movie, that rationally would not happen and that basicly makes the rest of the movie meaningless.The \"villans\" are so bland and distinguised from evil, that you with the same logic could make an arguement for Hitler or Mao not being evil, they just need to be \"cured\".I was stupid enough that i used my money on this movie, and i hope i can save some film entusiast from making the same mistake. But if you like mindless movie with tons of CGI and no plot be my guest...", "Damn that movie made me cry": "I just loved the movie , i loved tobey and andrew i am glad they got a chance to show us how to be a real spider man\nThe scene when she falls and the scene when tobey stops tom they are to remember.", "Some great moments but way too much going on": "Need to rein it in. Far too many different ideas and angles. Entertaining though with one excellent sequence in particular. Desperately need to move the character to the MCU fully. Appreciated the cameo near the beginning.", "Very Fantastic and awesome movie.": "The whole movie is fully goosebump. No way home is one of the best superhero movie all time. Those people are very very unlucky who don't watch this movie in theater/cinema hall.", "So many great characters, so little plot": "Sadly this movie had no plot. It's heavily character-driven and relies solely on decisions based off of Spider-Man's feelings and logic doesn't play a role.It has a lot of fan service in it. A few of the characters felt out of place and the only believable villain was Green Goblin (seriously Willem Dafoe stole the show).The jokes were not as cringey as in other recent Marvel movies and the cinematography is also good.All in all they relied too much on the cast and characters to carry. They are great, but they had no story to tell. Only a lot of funny dialogue with a sprinkle of (in my opinion) unnecessary drama that only provided shock value.", "Childish and predictable": "We were very disappointed of No Way Home. Worst Spider-Man of the Marvel Trilogy. Very childish story and drama. Actually this film is just about an unneccessary stupid mistake by Parker and how he wants to get things right then.The story didn't bring any benefits for the MCU. If you don't watch this film you won't miss anything for the MCU. It doesn't help on understanding the timeline of phase 4.You could say this film's only aim was to bring back old Spider-Mans and their enemies. If you don't know these actors it isn't funny at all.At the end you'll find Peter meeting MJ after the spell of Doctor Strange. He talks to her in the cafe and sees her plaster on the forehead. Why is he not asking her how she got that bruise? She would surely answer that it was from the fight with Spider-Man from the day before. Why doesn't Parker tell her that it was him in the Spider-Man costume and she would know?!? It totally makes no sense at all. It seems like an unlogical mistake in the story at the end.", "Best Spider-Man film yet": "Just went to see Spider-Man No Way Home this afternoon, it's so good!!! You won't wanna miss seeing this one, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire came back for this film.", "Best Spider-Man": "It was very good Spider-Man movie and The best Spider-Man was Tobey Maguire ever. But see all tree Spider-Man and all the villains together was also nice, it was funny action fully movie and deserves over 8.7 rate.", "Expecting more, got less": "I don't know what to think...slow start, it's a very slow start and fairly slow middle, a bit over emotional, I was expecting more action, more superhero stuff, but I felt a bit let down and wasn't too impressed, interesting twist of events though... which made up the last third of the film.The story starts exactly from the end of Far From Home where Peter Parker is revealed as Spider-Man. Public reaction appeared to be subdued apart from the moaning, bickering J. Jonah Jameson.We have confused bad guys and a superhero who wants to baby sit them. We have Peter's two close friends trying to help \"fight\" the bad guys, where \"fight\" is the least operative word.Peter's decisions were the cause of lots of damage, destruction and death.", "The best Spiderman film ever made.": "This movie hit all the right notes. I laughed, I cried, I was filled with joy, got goosebumps from excitement and it had me at the edge of my seat. I don't think that this film could have been done any better and how it was pulled off so flawlessly is beyond me. Huge congratulations to everyone that helped create this masterpiece! Please if you haven't seen this yet go watch it in IMAX if that's available to you. So excited to see what's coming for Tom Holland and his rendition of Spiderman! Can't believe that they made a better Spiderman film than Spiderman 2 and even made it better than Infinity War/ End Gam e but they did it!", "Tied for best MCU movie in my opinion": "When it came to my favorite MCU movie, I felt that Infinity War could not be beat. However, after seeing Spider-Man: No Way Home, I cannot justify rating it below Infinity War, nor can I rate it higher as I felt Infinity War was the apex of what Marvel could achieve (Endgame is close, but the convoluted time travel aspect of it did bring it down a bit) and the same can be said of this film. Everything about it is great and beyond anything else in the MCU, bringing a great deal of humor, heartache, and exhilaration throughout the runtime. The film is also darker than I expected, managing to be one of the darkest films in the MCU. Effects were great, story was cohesive and provided great stakes and covered all corners providing a satisfying and well rounded plot, and the acting was top notch. The only flaw I could find is minor in that a certain aspect of the ending proved to be very concerning in how the dynamic of future Spider-Man movies in this universe could change, but I feel that if kept in capable hands, my concerns with subsequent films will be put to rest. An all-around fantastic Marvel movie, Spider-Man movie, and movie overall.", "Kids ruin the whole movie": "These 4 kids making this movie so bore... their acting\nSkills like some YouTube home made video.. not impressed. Thus peter parker sound so annoying..", "Good movie. A masterpiece? My god, you gotta watch some real cinema!": "Classic Marvel movie, and a lot of fan service. Delivered in a decent way: it was hard to give each character the right screen time. I will tell you: it did not convince me at all, yet I can see all the problematics in doing a remarkable job, and therefore I can forgive them. So:1) acting: 8/10. William Dafoe is perfect, he is on another level. Seriously, this guy was born for this role. Doc Oc as good as always. The rest of them are on a good level, except for Zendaya: she has just 3 expressions for all the movie;2) Plot: mediocre. This isn't necessarily a problem, a simple plot with a good message is better than a complex plot with nothing underneath. And this film had a message: overcome rage and darkness to do what is right, not what you want. I appreciate that, even though I like darker characters, but it fits Spider-Man, therefore it is spotted!3) OST: marvelous. OST from first trilogy brought a smile to my face. New one is epic. Good job!4) CGI. Christ, it is on another level. You can see the effect of the CGI elements on the real word. Though, Lizard really sucks... And that's the reason we never see him with some light: because you would notice how poorly he has been developed! Like carnage and Venom...5) Mistakes? A lot of them. To list a few:\nA) You just had your life ruined and therefore the lives of the ones you love, and you care about Happy and May relationship? You got to revisit your priorities boy!B) Crappy dialogue in most of the cases; very good one in other cases. The problem is: at times, it is in the wrong spot (like them talking on the statue about the cobwebs: after what just happened and about to start what's going to happen? Bad idea;\nC) Ned is fun but kinda clich\u00e9 and his jokes are always predictable. It's the actor that makes you laugh, he is very good!;\nD) characters don't seem to make up their mind, they change their mentality for futile reasons and often do not behave consequently;\nE) Prodigious experiments delivered by a school boy in just few hours. Yes, I get he is a genius with tremendous tech and whatever, but it is just as crappy as Tony Stark coming up with a time machine in just a few hours;And there would be many more. All in all, a decent film with an interesting finale, spoiled only by the fact that, as always, it is good Vs Evil and you know what's going to happen. Yet, a kudos to the writers: I'm happy they didn't compete over the magic cube of Strange's, as i thought they would do. And, as long as I don't appreciate so much fan service, it was good seeing some characters again.So, a masterpiece? Not for me. It has still the classic Marvel crap that spoiled some of it. A disappointment? No. Even if I hated the film, and I didn't, just because of marvelous CGI and score and some of the acting, this film is a 6. To each one his own I guess.", "If you love Spider-Man you MUST watch this": "I rarely say a sequel is better than the original, but Tom Holland is literally the spider-man I read in the comics when I was a kid (I'm old) and to not spoil anything, but if you enjoyed any of the other Spider-Man movies there is definitely something you will enjoy and you absolutely have to watch this movie on the big screen, but please wear a mask.", "Just amazing": "Honestly I have no words. Everything about the movie was exciting, nostalgic, a bit of sadness and happiness at the same time. This is one of the best marvel masterpieces ever!", "Thank you Marvel studios !": "This is the thing what we are expected from you #marvelstudios. This will teach a lesson to those who say you can't give an emotional movie ! .Words cannot describe how I saw my friendly neighborhood Spiderman tobey maguire ! .I hated andrew garfield's Spiderman character at first but, after this craft there is no doubt that I am also a fan of him.The scene where the three peter parker's talk about their girlfriend in their universe made me think I should hold my girlfriend's hands and kiss and cry !", "Shockingly Juvenile": "The fan service was kinda cool. But man, did that get old fast. I counted no less than a dozen hugs and 'you're the best man' moments in the final half of the film. Some of them dragged on to absolute cringe levels.Dopey Doe-eyed Spider-Man is, um, kind of a moron.I realize they needed a story arc, but dammit... Dr. Strange really lost it in this schlock of a movie. They turned one of the most brilliant MCU characters of all-time into an irrational plot device for the dumbest reason.It only got worse from there. Fully knowing Dr. Strange brilliance and expertise in all things time and space... Spider-man makes the most brain-dead decision early on.What god-awful writing. I know we're all suppose to give a pass to Spidey in this MCU causes he's young and inexperienced blah blah... but holy s***... even for someone that is suppose to be 17... what a f'n idiot.This is the same Spidey that saw first hand the s*** that went down with Thanos and the Avengers. The full power and expertise of Dr. Strange and The Avengers. He learned nothing. Its like he reverted into a babbling doe-eyed child in this movie.Overall a shockingly juvenile film that by the end was depressing and unnecessary.The end really did show how juvenile and inexperienced Spider-Man truly is. Maybe that was the whole point. I guess?", "Fan service movie": "Absolute last from start to finish an unexpected ending which good in way .overall great fan services and story to continue marvel cinematic universe.", "As a lifelong spider-man fan....beautiful": "I've loved Spider-man since the 90's animated show and grew up reading the comics, and this movie brought me to tears several times. I have been a very large critic of the direction the MCU has taken spider-man but they have earned my full faith moving forward, and I wholeheartedly expect Tom Holland to show us an amazing Peter Parker for years to come.Some are saying this movie is only fan service, but I don't think that's a bad thing. Jon Watts showed he truly understands what being spider-man means and what it entails. It feels like \"fan service\" because there was so much payoff, so much nostalgia and just pure unadulterated joy.Enjoy your time watching this movie, because it truly is classic spider-man that unites the whole fandom.", "Movie? Nah its a tribute to all Spidey fans.": "No words can describe how amazing this movie turned out to be. This movie is a once in a lifetime experience. It is a kind of a movie which will leave a long lasting effect on viewers mind. I laughed, I cried, I cheered and remained amazed while watching this. There was never a dull moment in the entire runtime of 2 hours 30 minutes. This movie turned out to be even better than Endgame.The actors were amazing and not to mention the eye popping visual effects. Marvel really made yet another history with this one. What an amazing conclusion to a trilogy. Kudos to Jon Watts and every cast and crew of this film.", "Spidey 3": "This was my first foray back to a theater proper since COVID started to ravage the land and I am SO glad that I made the trip for this one. Recency Bias is potentially in full effect here but as of right now this may be in my top 5 MCU films. Holland once again flexes on why he's the best all around Spider-Man we've had and the cast around him really brought it all up a notch.I'm finding it weirdly hard to say much about this one because, while I think a lot of people know the conceit of this move, I've always found Marvel to be quite adept at misdirection with their trailers. They give you enough to think you know what's going on and still manage to throw a curveball or two and I feel like that was definitely in effect here. So, broad strokes. As I said, the cast is amazing. Everyone here really seemed to be enjoying their time and cranking out really solid work. There was one CGI intensive individual who I felt was... Not so great, but that aside I was quite pleased overall.I think the biggest positive was in the overall universe though. Love it or Hate it, the MCU was a game-changing creation in cinema. It makes a ridiculous amount of money and since its inception and success we've had pretty much every other franchise or studio wanting to get in on the Cinematic Universe game. I think we can unilaterally agree Marvel has been the most successful with this but it has come at a cost. The Marvel Formula, that singular thematic note that runs across so many of their films and has a tendency to make them all feel fairly similar. This one felt different to me. Thanos and the Infinity Stones are in the rearview. We're moving away from Iron Man's domination of the universe and getting to this stage where these heroes can interact with each other and/or the world on their own without some huge, overarching forced contrivance. This shift in tone, this lack of being on the Infinity track really let me sit back and watch this movie and finally feel like this was a lived in universe and I loved that.That aside, I didn't care for Black Widow, and Shang-Chi was fun but overall kinda meh to me. I had worried that COVID may have brought about the end of the MCU's streak of great popcorn flicks but Spider-Man swung in and saved the day. I've suddenly got renewed hope and excitement going forward. Hell, I'm even a little pumped for Morbius now, even though I'm still pretty sure that wont be any good.As for the theater experience... I missed it but I think I'll be staying home for the majority of releases and only venturing out for the big, effects driven spectacles. That's probably a whole different discussion though.", "5 points for the stars of Tobey Maguire's trilogy": "Who thankfully came back for a while. Other than that, nothing to see here. 2 and half hours for fake tears with no chemistry among the actors.Also, even if comics were like that, I never understood why new spidermen need web-shooters: This would mean anyone could be spiderman if he had web-shooters. Somniferous direction.I should have better watched the original trilogy for the 10th time than that.", "The Most Fun I've had in Theaters": "This is going to be remembered as one of the greatest films from this decade. It won't be sweeping the Oscars but it will be beloved by the public for generations to come. It was definitely worth the wait. As I've mentioned in previous reviews, I'm one of the people with Marvel fatigue. I'm fed up with Marvel's pop culture takeover and their churning out films every single year. But even I enjoyed this film.They really use the element of nostalgia to keep the audience's attention, but it's done so in a fun and entertaining way. I was of the generation that grew up with Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man so my inner child was really happy to see him, Alfred Molina, and Willem Defoe back on the screen. Andrew Garfield had his redeeming moment in this film, after being labeled the \"worst Spider-Man\" by many movie goers and fans. The movie even pokes fun at this in one of the scenes and has the first cinematic Peter Parker, Tobey Maguire, tell him that he was indeed \"amazing.\" I really enjoyed that scene. The action scenes are great, the final battle at the end is epic and the emotional scenes tug at your heartstrings.It had a couple of similar moments to The Spiderverse animated film that was released a couple years ago. I don't think they could really do it any other way though. One scene that was straight from the Spiderverse film was when the other two Spider-Man's are telling Tom Holland Spider-Man how they also lost someone special in their timelines. It's not identical but it is similar. Into The Spiderverse is my #1 favorite Spider-Man film but this one is now my second. Plus they hinted at the future inclusion of Miles Morales when electro said some dialogue that asked if there's a Black Spider-Man somewhere out there.I highly recommend going to see this film while it's still in theaters. It's a really fun experience. Great job to everyone involved in this project. I can tell they had fun making it and the result is fantastic.", "Watt's Amazing Spidermen": "Extraordinary storytelling, cast and execution. Worth the wait! Shows why spiderman is one of the most fan favourite character. Special thanks to Sony for the non spoiler marketing. Will we get a better Spidey movie in future?-That's doubtful. Final fight sequence lacks some lightings which makes us hard to follow the stunts. Goosebumps overloaded!!! Perfect ending to the triology, hope we will get another Spidey movie soon.", "Best Spider-Man Ever.": "If you have seen all the other Spider-Man movies with Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield. Then you will enjoy this one aswell. Very Funny. Very well put together. Wrapped up alot of things and questions across all the movies, Spider-Mans and MCU alike. Must See!!!!", "An incredible achievement!": "This movie was possibly the most fun I've ever had in the theater. The fact that they made a movie with so many amazing callbacks, references, and memes and it still manages to be a fantastic movie even without all that is really impressive. If you're a big Spider-Man fan like myself, this is absolutely the movie for you. If you haven't watched all the previous movies the references obviously won't hit as hard but there's still a great story with excellent directing, fun characters, great humor, awesome action and stunning visuals all around. So even if you're not a fan I think you'll still have a great time.It's still crazy to me that they were able to pull this off. I don't think there's ever been a movie with this much fan service. Spider-Man's really been hitting on all cylinders these last few years. Can't wait to see what they do next!", "Everything I wanted and more!": "I cannot begin to describe how much I loved this movie! It's truly the most excited I've been coming out of a movie in a long time! Jon Watts and the team behind this MCU Spider-Man trilogy have done such a good job delivering some of Spider-Man's best films... but this one truly takes the cake! It's my favourite Spidey film and quite possibly one of my favourite comic book movies in general! Everything it did worked so well for me and exceeded all of my expectations! I was completely blown away! And honestly I hope everyone else is too, which is why I don't want to go into too much detail with this review... it's got so many fantastic surprises in it (that had my theatre's audience cheering) that I don't want to spoil for anyone. To even begin to talk about the movie in depth would take away from such a fun experience, so all I can say is just go watch it yourself! It truly shows why Spider-Man is such a beloved character, and delivers a film that honours everything that has come before while also being a very fitting conclusion to Tom Holland's \"Homecoming\" trilogy! It stuck the landing perfectly, and even I was doubtful that they could do it! It truly impressed me as a fan, and I just loved all the moments of fan-service and how those actually served the narrative in clever ways! I cheered, I laughed, I even cried! It's definitely the most emotional Spider-Man movie out there and the 3rd act is really something special. This one is gonna go down in pop-culture and cinematic history, it's awesome and does things that we've really never seen before! And it has to be said, Tom Holland is truly wonderful as Spider-Man, and shows here how gifted of an actor he really is! It's his best turn as the character to date! I also loved the return of classic villains, but I don't wanna get into specifics about it for spoiler reasons. I loved where the story went and it constantly kept me guessing and kept surprising me, I just was so blown away!! I'm deliriously happy by what this movie delivered, it hit all the right notes, and I cannot wait to see it again! It is without a doubt top tier Marvel; it's so good I don't even believe that it's real! Just go see it, it's astounding!", "100000/10": "What really more is there to say? A heartbreakingly powerful piece of art which captivates the intended purpose perfectly. I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish and couldn't utter a single word for about half an hour after because I was so moved. The best Spider-Man and can I go as far to say MCU movie of all time! Tom Holland you are one of the generations finest actor. Your ability to capture the five stages of grief and turn it into something so powerful is of the charts. Incredible job from the ensemble as well played their role perfectly to create easily the best film of the year. Ok I'm going to go and watch it again now!!!", "A lot of fan service but still a great film": "There are a few things that annoyed me about this film and i'll get them out of the way early. Firstly this film could and perhaps should have ended after an hour, the notion that spider-man won't let strange sent them back to their universes because they will die at some point is stupid, i get that spider-mans weakness is his morality but really that's what you're going to do. Secondly the fan service of this film is too in your face, yes it's great to hear Willem Dafoe say \"I'm something of a scientist myself\" and calling Andrew Garfield's spider-man \"amazing\" in reference to his film franchise but these lines feel forced and shoe-horned in (the interaction between the spider-men is also kinda cringy).With that out of the way though, what a great film this is.Tom Hollands spider-man (naivety aside) is excellent, in this post avengers world, he can no longer be the friendly neighbourhood spider-man and as Doctor Strange so accurately says \"I always forget your just a kid\" and that is what this film focuses on most, he is trying to be just a normal kid, excited to see if he and his friends all get in to university together and yet he is thrust in to this constant spotlight having had his identity revealed.*i will update this further later.", "Best Spiderman movie ever.": "Worth for the wait. Each character's motives was well handled without any draggy scenes. No any unnecessary scenes. Love all the epic scenes.Especially, the ending fight scenes between Green Goblin and Spiderman. This movie shows the growth and maturity of Tom Holland's Peter Parker very well since civil war. This is a great standalone film for Peter Parker because Peter was overshadowed by Tony Stark in his previous movies . This film will be a milestone in Tom Holland's acting career. He proved again that heis a great actor.Williem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx are the backbone to the movie after Tom Holland. They made this movie even more closer to our heart. Most importantly, Williem Dafoe stole the show. Overally, an awesome emotional, thrilling, funny, nostalgic and action-packed film with a lot of suprises. The post credit scenes are just mind-blowing.Keep your expectations low and enjoy the movie....", "Expected more story": "Ok. It's big, it's fun. It's worth a watch. Is it \"the best Spider-Man Movie\" ?No, it isn't. Not for Me.It's like a nostalgic best of album at the end of a remarkable career of a popular rockstar. But of course, real Fans always love best of albums.The story ? Spidey doesn't like to cope with his uncovered identity and asks his Avemger buddy Dr. Strange to give him his unknown private life back. What will finally be done. That's it. And from this point on, all the already known elements of his past reappear and make his life even more complicated. Some really funny dialogue between the 3 Spiders help to get over the very long running time. The visually stunning, but totally stupid \"marvelous Multiverse\" scenes with Strange and Spidey are - for me - unnecessary elements in the so far far less abstract world of Spider-Man. It's too much Marvel/Avemgers fan stuff for Me. Anyway, it's a Movie to conclude a long list of more or less stand-alone pictures in a clever and very well done way. But you definitely need to have seen all the other pics of you want to have fun - if not l, you have no clue what happens on the screen....", "Nostalgia.... Great performances": "The film shows a completely different side to Peter Parker, he's no longer the happy child presented in civil war and perhaps infinity war, but rather a sad and rather lost teen. This film has an amazing cast and the acting is incredible. You can tell the movie was insane by the audible gasps in the cinema. It felt as if this was the pinnacle of film when Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire jump through portals to reprise their roles as Spider-Man. Amazing.", "Looks like Marvel ran out of ideas!": "I went in with a lot of expectations from this movie. Since the previous instalments were pretty decent. But this kind of disappointed. Understand that this is a super hero movie and one cannot expect logic et al. But over all I felt the movie was just written by someone who had almost all of their creative juices evaporated.I still don't understand the need to bring in old villains and then lead up to the same sort of climax that one is used to. The dialogues were funny but only sparsely. Some of them were down right lame.I guess may be i've had an overdose of monotonous super hero movies.The only good part in the movie was the visual effects.Watch it if you are a die hard spider man fan though. It's average but it definitely isn't boring.", "Sweet and bitter taste of Nostalgia": "Again a spiderman , yet again the same vibe and yet again the same old spidermans ? And same old villains? Wait what?So lets be short a sweet : was it entertaining ? Yes it was !! .... But was it as good as \u00abinto the spiderverse \u00bb ? Not nearly....Its fun to see all this group back together in one film ..but lets face it , i dont want to remember a lot of the underwhelming spidermans/villains of old..\nin fact, the profusion of old school people make it hard for any of them to really shine. No time to develop correctly. But ! Since we all saw those movies as mediocre as they were it does get the emotion and nostalgia.And yes, It still is One of the best spiderman movie.The other issue for me is that most of the \u00ab originality \u00bb comes from Dr. Strange wich is in fact the savior of this MCU since he is also the one behind Endgame and yet again here helps bring a plot to this spiderman movie... and yes dr strange movie is great too : dr strange mvp of mcu. Award... during the movie packed in action some are well realized but also really cgi , it still lacked this epic scene or this moment of brilliance.I do think that the actor is well made for this role and is able to relate the younger audience wich is captivated by the romance of the girl him tiktok and all this ... and i fact he is probably the best spiderman yetSo is it a masterpiece ? No.. is it original ? Somewhat ? Is it emotional ? Yet . Is it fun ? Yes , is it a good blockbuster ? Yes ! Cool movie.", "Deja vu of a childhood love": "I'm 24 and grew up around the spidermen movies. Watching the first one on a dodgy VHS tape over and over again. Left with the overwhelming desire to become the man himself.Trying every morning to fire webs from my wrists to no avail.This film brought back those heartwarming memories. I'm not an huge fan of the marvel universe but this film is a must see and one I intend to watch many times over.", "If they would not have brought old spiderman, then I would probably give it 4/10": "-First of all ,Tom Holland is the worst spiderman.-Second, They did not give proper entry and importance to other two older spiderman.-Only Dr Octopus had the best show out of all the characters.Dissapointing. One Time watch, for the sake of old beloved spideys.", "No way, I can get this.": "I can't get what I want. Really far below my expectations, to be honest. If I remember correctly, this is the sixth film in which Tom Holland stars as Peter Parker. Civil War, Homecoming, Infinity War, Endgame, FFH, NWH. Yet, his character in this film is still not well developed. How long should I wait until he is mature enough? 2, 3 more titles?P.s. I understand that the point of this film is for Strange open up the multiverse, but not in this way.", "A Home run!!!!": "\"The best of all you can get\". Jon Watts have hit this one out of the park. I wasn't impressed much with the previous 2 Tom Holland versions, but this one oh boy!!! Too many fan boy moments and nostalgic moments.. And the drama phew!!! Man that was awesome. Do watch in theatres. Trust me, you wont regret this one. Not even for a second .", "Any Spider-Man fans dream come true": "Im completely speechless. I cannot fault this film in anyway. Bringing together three generations of spidermen in the best way possible. Goosebumps the whole way through the movie. Excited for Tom Hollands future as Spider-Man in the MCU. Way to go Marvel and Sony.", "Great holiday blockbuster": "Having watched all previous Spider Man movies, what I liked about this one in particular, was the sense of closure for the characters from previous movies that appear in it. A great finish for the trilogy and previous films.", "Mind blowing phenomenal Spiderman that changes your perception of everything": "This movie changes everything especially your perception of reality as things are not always what they seem. We first start out from where we left of in Far From Home post blip where obviously Mysterio has revealed Spidermans identity of Peter Parker as you do see the initial overwhelming impact especially on Peter and MJ as the news broke as they where in times square as we previously know. We see Peter swinging webs to get both him and MJ out of the crowd and to safety. So tensions run high in the city personifying New York cities residents once again as a character either believing the news from the iconic J. Jonah Jameson, nevertheless it being a either you love him, or you hate him moment in the city appearing 50/50 split. Initially Peter, MJ and Ned are trying to figure out what to do as the news is having massive impact on their lives. So decisions are made by Peter to go to Doctor Strange to try and make everyone all forget apart from the people who already know and that is where we go the rabbit hole there having catastrophic consequences. We obviously see the return of the villains from the past Spiderman universes such as Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, Electro, Sandman and the lizard kind of making it like a big boss battle for Peter to deal with. Just wondering where our sixth villain is from the sinister six is, nevertheless the villains have a true part to play really creating a pivotal point for them as we know their original fates does not end well. There will be moments in this movie which will leave you emotional as well as funny little gags and lots of nostalgia too. There is epic fight scenes and CGI really complementing the movie and the characters leaving you loving Spiderman even more. We will see Peter coming to several crossroads during this movie that will change reality forever for him and everyone else, therefore he must make the correct decision before it is too late. Overall this movie has been absolutely amazing to watch as it truly changes everything bringing everything together. Seeing Peter and MJ romantic relationship grow as trusting each other is key especially during these tough situations ahead. We do really see MJ and Ned becoming their own heroes as they have been key to helping Peter along the way as if not the wrong decisions could have been made with even more catastrophic consequences, also they help catch the iconic villains too. Well done to Marvel along with the rest and the cast and crew on creating such a phenomenal movie that really has the cinema atmosphere going wild that we have not seen since end game everyone cheering together, laughing, crying etc. Really did add another element to the movie especially for all Spiderman fans out there, this really brought everything together so well leaving us all hyped to what is to come next. I know I said it last time as well, but this is truly the best Spider Man yet my favourite Spider Man Film really bringing everyone together and back into the cinema for this phenomenal experience. Zendaya and Tom Hollands acting is phenomenal as always and their chemistry is just shown onscreen so well I do hope we get to see their relationship grow more on and off screen as they are truly the cutest.", "No way going home after this, must see 2nd time": "What did I see??? Perfect in any way! Better than endgame, the story was given in the best way, people was chearing on their seats, everybody was happy when was heading at the exit. Battles were not so long thus we didn't tired up from the cgi.Remember to stay until the end titles are finished, there is something you won't be happy if you missed it.", "INSANE!": "Amazing, emotional, full with surprises, perfect performances and visuals. Few good funny scenes and a lot of great action scenes!!The end though is painful\ud83d\ude29..", "Best Live-Action Spiderman... Yet.": "Uh, let me see if I can think of something bad to say about this movie... searching... no... nah... nope, can't find it. No complaints here at all. They managed to do a lot of fan service scenes without taking away from the current story.I'm really excited for the future of the franchise after this.If you've ever enjoyed Spiderman, you will probably love this movie.Even if you've had the movie spoiled for you, it's still an amazing watch. I was fortunate enough to be one-hundred percent completely spoiler free before watching this and the movie blew my freakin' mind so I shall say no more.", "Next Level - Brings Together All The Spider Man Movies": "Unexpected and entertaining. Takes you on a roller coaster ride.This movie makes a Spider Man Movie Universe, where you can watch all the Spider Man movies and connect them all with this single movie.One of the best movies of all time.", "very good": "I saw it, it was very good. It wasn't some sort of masterpiece, but it was probably the best 3rd part of a trilogy movie ever. I have a sneaking suspicion that Toby Maguires Spider-man died originally but they changed it so he lives. Think about the impact his death speech to our Spider-man could have had passing the baton? Instead it was interlaced by the two previous or alternate reality versions warning him not to become them. I suspect a little tweaking! Why have the big emotional scene like that not pan out? Probably worried it would upset too many fans.", "Relive the Nostalgia.": "Technically the film is good and screenplay too. Screen pace should be more for other two Peter Parker and too emotional made the film little off beat than the rest which worked for few audience but didn't click up for me but the transition of Holland spider man from kid to understand the responsibilities looked like a tribute for entire spider man ever made and its a nostalgia . I didn't like the music in the film which didn't give me the hype like other two spider man. Nostalgia is the pure essence of the film which people are particularly excited for this movie which they should have made more like into the spider verse movie which it definitely lacks. This is the time MCU spider man learns to live his life like other two. So that's the punch which made the climax good. It was good to watch Tobey and Andrew and all swinging together to make everything right which went chaos. William Dafoe was \ud83d\udd25. Tobey spider man 2 is still the best spider man for me. But a phenomenal conclusion or start for Holland spider man. Its 3.5/5 for me.", "Literally AMAZING! \ud83d\udd77": "You'll laugh, you'll cheer, you'll cry.This movie has done the Spidey (and MCU) fans proud.When I walked out of the cinema, in a daze, after what I had just seen.....I wanted to walk back in and watch it again!", "Wow really wow epic": "Amazing movie contains everything you need Sad moments, happy moments,love,great fight scenes, memories,emotional moments,conflicts and great eye experience. Enjoyed every second. It is a masterpiece.", "Perfect, my favorite MCU movie": "As a fan of Spider-Man since seeing the first movies with Tobey Maguire as a kid I've grown to love the franchise and super heroes ever since. Not only does No Way Home uses every second of the movie to work on Hollands Spider-Man in the MCU connecting him with his villains and villains from both Raimis and Sony's universe. Relationships are formed villains from the past are seen again in a new light the movie is great. The other MCU movies with Holland puts light on him as a teenage Spider-Man but No Way Home tests Peter making the right moral decisions, handling hardships as Spider-Man and as Peter, and then handling tragedy ultimately alone as his final sacrifice puts him further into the shoes of the hero we've grown to love as Spider-Man. When Maguire and Garfield's Spidermen get introduced into the movie it's done so in the most exciting unsuspecting way possible, the entire theatre went crazy and loud. The final battle with the 3 Spidermen had everyone up in their seats as they take a higher route in handling the villains. I couldn't have asked for a better Spider-Man movie and to get closure and loose ends tied to Maguire and Garfield's Peter Parker was a treat in itself. It's hard to choose anything to pick on from start to finish there is never a dull moment this is probably the most fun I've had in a movie theater in forever. If you're debating on whether you should wait to see it don't go as soon as possible you will not regret it.", "ONCE IN A LIFETIME EXPERIENCE!": "Will NEVER EVER experience the same feelings in a movie ever again! We were all literally screaming and cheering like a bunch of 10 year olds! (especially when we saw Matt, Peter 2 and Peter 3 \ud83e\udd23) This movie made me feel like a kid again! Incredible, just AMAZING!", "I swear you will never see anything like this ever again..": "Where do I begin, oh my god, this movie just made me so so happy by everything that it was, everything. Such a great story 10/10 amazing experience. Go watch this movie in theaters right now. Omg still cannot fathom what just happened. Everything was perfect. \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5", "Overrated Garbage": "I really struggle to understand the almost universal praise for this film. I was as excited as anyone to see exactly what they were going to do with the endless possibilities of the film's premise, but I came out of the cinema feeling conned by what I saw as a shameless cash grab by marvel. Almost nothing in this film's already lazily thrown together plot made sense; for instance we were told by dr strange that \"everyone who knows Peter Parker is spiderman\" came through the multiverse. Firstly, why...? The film didn't bother to explain this any further, just offering the justification of \"because magic/ the multiverse\". Secondly, several of the villains that came through didn't even know Peter Parker was Spiderman, as Jamie Foxx's character even admits at the end of the film. But nothing that happened over the course of the exasperating couple of hours of runtime mattered anyway because Dr Strange just did a magic spell to reverse everything. The filmmakers seemed to just think that viewers would blindly accept or just wouldn't notice these gaping plot holes, which is a huge insult to our intelligence. But based on the reception this film got, it seems that marvel correctly estimated the intelligence of the majority of their viewership, expecting the appearance of several beloved characters from previous franchises to send them into such a giddy state that they thought this film was good. And full credit to marvel, it worked. If this kind of lazy writing punctuated by ridiculous meme-bait and popcorn moments is the future of cinema then I think it would have been best if the pandemic had spelled the end for cinema as we know it.", "AMAZING! SPECTACULAR! THAT'S SPIDEY!!!": "Nothing much to say, the title says for itself but for sure that's one of the best on MCU so far and absolutely sure the best Spiderman movie ever.Fantastic job from everyone involved, from the actors to the producers, the whole cast indeed!Amazing story, fantastic plot, great CGI but that's definitely the kind of movie that CGI matters. Amazing fan service very very well done.Wish all movie could be as deep as this one, involving, funny, thrilling, sad and happy moments.

Basically, if you're a marvel fan, you'll love it, if not it will still be a good movie to watch.", "Teenage romantic comedy": "Movie overqualified.

Took movie after movie to discover his strengths.After took care of thanos & his experience in civil war, he's still not strong enough to take care maguire & garfield's villains. His spidey sense is much like final destination's sense.I love how strong green goblin is. This disneyfication approach on villains by turning them bad to good is paying of, like you have mental illness? You're not a bad guy, just use the great power & be responsible for the consequences.This movie has depressing moment like maguire & garfield's version, for some superhero the tragedy will happen sooner or later.Is this the end?

You will definitely not be disappointed. The reason I'm not giving it a ten is that certain scenes I felt could have been done better and after hearing the opinions of two friends who have never seen a Spider-Man movie before I can see where they are coming from. Some scenes were rushed and didn't really make that much sense (portal scene).", "Dumb Story Line from the start with the MIT thing": "Only good VE and Sound, the story is absolutely dumb from the start, like a children book, and no real logic and reasoning behind the entire story line , certainly does not deserve the current ratings.", "I just don't get why people love this kind of film": "Please someone tell me why this is so good.

Marvel did it Marvel-ously \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb", "decent movie": "I deffo liked this movie because of its unique storyline and also the comeback of the previous peter parker's but the ending was quite unnecessary if yk what i mean..", "Unbelievable firepower for the fans": "I'm absolutely captivated. An unbelievable blast for Spider-Man fans. I didn't think Marvel would come up with anything this spectacular after Endgame. The new Spider-Man may not surpass the Avengers in my opinion, but he's damn close on their heels. This was unreal. All three Spider-Men together. Seeing Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man on screen was a dream of mine and this movie made it come true. When he showed up, I thought I was gonna cry. Aside from him, I was very happy to see old familiar bad guys like Goblin and Octopus, who were absolutely excellent. I keep raving about how much I enjoyed the return of familiar faces from the Spider-Man trilogy, but I also have to praise the line of the current one or Tom Holland, which was also wonderful and had some really great moments. What I was very pleasantly surprised by, and actually can't believe, is how much they managed to cram it all into two and a half hours. It's already a longer film, but with a giant cast of characters. It's all very fast-paced here, so I wasn't bored at all and kept getting adrenaline shots. Wordless action. Totally unreal. Famous. I enjoyed it so much. As I mentioned the film is fast paced but despite that there is nothing rushed and I felt like every character had their own space. I don't understand how Marvel does it, but in short, they've proven that they can take bigger bites and do a great job of it, and I'm smiling. This movie had huge potential, no doubt. I was worried it wouldn't live up to it. I'm having a hard time judging it here. I'm slightly disappointed by some things and slightly pleased by others. Some things have been pleasantly surprising, others have been disappointing. In short, I could even imagine some moments that would have been perfect with all three Spider-Men, but unfortunately it didn't happen. On the contrary, there were other moments that I didn't expect and I was very pleasantly surprised and they were really cool. But I think it turned out great and with a few exceptions I'm absolutely satisfied. It's already a longer film and if all the potential was to be used, I really don't know how many hours the film would end up being. But a lot was accomplished in 2 and a half hours, for which I take my hat off. To sum it up. Spider-Man: No Way Home is, in my opinion, one of the best Marvel movies ever made, and for me, a great movie that I recommend.", "EVERY SPIDER-MAN FAN NEEDED THIS FILM": "Spider-Man's identity is now revealed. Therefore, Peter Parker now has to fight his identity and live two lives, one as Parker and the other as Spider-Man. Peter asks Doctor Strange for help in which the spell goes wrong because of Parker and he has to face the consequences of his own mistake.Spider-Man No Way Home is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The film presents several different emotions and experiences that are worthy for a Spider-Man audience. This film is made specifically for Spider-Man fans.Jon Watts uses several different techniques that some are taken from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy. For instance, the action sequences and how the camera moves in them, or the Spider-Man swings and his movements and poses during such sequences. The cinematography in this film is great. The use of close-up shots and extreme close-up shots to capture the emotions on characters' faces as well as the use of wide shots or medium shots to capture the set design and action or event that is happening in a specific scene.Tom Holland gives his best performance as Spider-Man. Audience members are finally able to see Peter Parker's struggle to live two different lives and his struggle to maintain a sustainable life as a teenager to accommodate his dreams and ambitions. Tom Holland plays a big role in delivering these feelings to the audience as he got the chance in this film to really show himself in which the development of his acting is clear. As it is confirmed in the trailer, there are 5 villains from past Spider-Man films who appear in this film, 2 of them are unfortunately there as fan service (only to please them). Without them, the film would have been the same. On the other hand, Green Goblin (played by Willem Defoe) and Doc Ock (played by Alfred Molina) are the opposite. They have enough screen time and their appearance in the film is as important ad the main characters. After 18 years, William Defoe is able to play both Norman Osborn and Green Goblin as perfectly as he did 18 years ago in Raimi's Spider-Man version. In a specific scene, he literally turns from Norman Osborn to the villein Green Goblin in which is seen by his amazingly done acting and facial expressions. A quick transformation like that in one scene done by one actor playing two different characters commit be done by many actors. The same exact thing goes for Alfred Morino as Doc Ock as his performance is great as well and similar to Defoe's.During the events of the film, the characters go through lots of tough decisions in which they decide to choose some of the dumbest that it'll make audience members wonder why. In addition, a few events happen without explaining them well or not going in-depth in them or not explaining at all, which creates a hole in the film itself. However, and even though all of these negativities exist, the film's positive side hides these negativities and makes them invisible because of how FULL this film is. The ending is absolutely great and the perfect one that's needed.The film's first act is good. It sets audience members to what is about to happen and gets them ready for the events of the film. Then it moves to the second act which is somewhat messy at times and lacks in few scenes due to its boring sequences that may seem long. However, that does not mean that it isn't entertaining. It still has a few events that play a big role in terms of the story. The third act saves the whole film. It is well written and very well made in terms of the story, action, visual effects, or even the dialogues. Same as Homecoming (2017) and Far From Home (2019), No Way Home has several funny sequences that are actually funny and not cringy or cheesy. It may even be the best Spider-Man or superhero film that maintains a perfect balance between comedy, drama, and action.Spider-Man No Way Home is the film that every Spider-Man fan ever wanted. It has comedy, excitement, disappointments, drama, and everything you ever want. The film balances perfectly between everything to present an entertaining film from start till end. Experiencing it in IMAX with a full-house theatre was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.My rating is 9.5/10\nWatched in IMAX.", "Nostalgic. I laughed and I cried. What a movie!": "I've been waiting for this one a long time so it's fair to say I went in with big expectations and they were met! What an unbelievable movie! First off I want to say that this was a great finale for Tom Holland's Spider-Man and although I do hope he stays to make more this would also be a great and emotional farewell to his iteration of the character who I believe to be the best ever Spider-Man.Now on to the part everyone was anticipating... Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield!!!!! When Andrew came on screen everyone including me clapped and cheered in the cinema but when Tobey came on screen the cinema became absolutely electric! It felt like every single person in the cinema was back to being a kid again, reliving their childhood to when Tobey was the definitive Spider-Man and the Spider-Man of our generation. I'm not gonna lie I shed a tear seeing them back on screen! \ud83d\ude2d Also what I found so satisfying was the closure they gave to those two Spider-Men because I never felt that their movie series finished when they were meant to. I also have to note that the banter between the three was outstanding and really brought a smile to the face of everyone in the cinema!Seeing Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx again was also an absolute delight, they were just as amazing as they were all those years ago.For me this movie had everything I imagined it would I can't recommend people watch it enough! Thank you Marvel for bringing this together, you have brought us closure and you have brought us happiness in such dark times.", "Did not disappoint.": "I took my 11yr old to see this. He has been asking to go watch it and man I'm glad I took him. It was fun to watch him be into the story line and him knowing the characters who they were from which film and such. SPOILER ALERT!!!! The whole multiverse plot and seeing the previous villains from other spider man movies and Toby were awesome. Stay till the end of credits btw.", "The 2nd best Spider-Man movie ever": "There are many reasons as to why this movie is simply great. First off the fan service is fantastic especially with the return of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man. Secondly Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina steal the show much like they did in the first two Spider-Man films. (The original film is still the best) As we progress through the movie it becomes evidently clear who the main Villain is, (Green Goblin) as Doctor Octopus isn't really a villain in this movie for long. As for the other three villains Electro is great but Sandman and The Lizard feel unnecessary and do feel thrown in just to build up the excitement for the movie. I really hope that this movie opens up more doors for Tobey and Andrew to return in the future as I feel as if Tom Hollands Spider-Man is the only one we're going to get a definitive ending to. I have to say that I am a bit disappointed that we didn't get at least any form of Venom in this movie. I mean he is referenced by Tobey Maguire (the version played by Topher Grace) but for some reason we don't go much further than that with Venom.I do think though that if eventually if Tom Holland comes under the influence of a Symbiote the results could be very good and destructive as I do think that Hollands Spider-Man is very much blinded by rage. (Though understandable given the circumstances).All in all it's a very good movie and I'll admit near the end of the movie my heart sank as I almost wanted to cry. But I didn't. To me this film recaptures the magic of the original trilogy and I hope this gives Sony the incentive to finally give us the REAL Spider-Man 4 and give Tobey's character arc a fitting conclusion.", "BEST SPIDEY FILM (SPOILERS)": "Man this film was fire the story , the emotion , the nostalgia, by far not just the best spidey movie its the best superhero movie ever , when ned teliported them, the entire theatre was crying and screaming , and when aunt may died everyone were crying i would give it 20/10\nit's the best spidey movie ever.", "Best movie ever. Deserves full 10 rating": "It's not just a movie, it's an emotion, a feeling. It's a masterpiece delivered by marvel and sony in such a fantastic way that will make you feel like you are on a roller-coaster ride of nostalgia. For me, it was my whole childhood presented on a screen in front of my eyes. I am truly overwhelmed. This movie is just stuck in my head ever since I watched it. It is nothing like I have ever watched before. Never thought something like this is possible. To think of such a concept like this is a brilliance of a mind. It pleases you, surprises you, makes you scream, makes you cry, makes you laugh.... It is just perfect.And the cinematic experience and the experience of watching it with fellow marvel fans is out of words, just to say honestly, marvel fans together honestly just turn cinemas into stadiums.I don't think I will ever be able to forget this movie. Just my opinion, I think this movie will be the talk for generations to come.", "Good entertainment.": "Although the movie is entertaining and it reflects in the ratings it got on here, I didn't think this was the best of the Spider-Man movies. The concept was nice, and bringing all the different actors of Spider-Man together was also a nice move, but still I've watched better ones. The cast was great though, Tom Holland, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield together that is great for Spider-Man fans, but also many great names playing the villains. The budget was 200 millions and that shows in the great CGI's. The whole movie looked like shot in front of a green screen, which has its positives but also negatives with sometimes scenes that look lesser realistic. Overal it's another supeheroes movie worth a watch, certainly for the fans of this genre.", "Amazing !": "This movie was incredible. Everything you could've wanted in this and more. Tom Hollands Spider-Man finally had a real struggle to overcome like the others. He truly became Spider-Man in this movie. This movie made me laugh and cry multiple times. Seeing all three Spider-Man together was hilarious and nostalgic. Andrew Garfield was amazing!(pun intended). He finally got his redeem himself and save the girl. His acting was incredible. Tobey was incredible as well. All three Spider-Man had a lot of chemistry on screen. Fantastic movie.", "A fun movie carried by nostalgia": "Seeing some reviews and people calling this movie one of the best movies marvel has produced is a shocker, as it's far from it. A great experience and a fun watch, but in terms of its strength as a movie is very poor. Poor acting from Zendeya and most of the cast, and a storyline that seems to be somewhat reminding of a school play, the nostalgia was great but that is one of the very few points going for it. A bit of a disappointment, but a enjoyable film nonetheless.", "Nostalgia and good acting": "Nostalgia and good acting Make this movie a fun ride. It's not the greatest story of the MCU but past characters from the previous iterations of the franchise deliver. I was not expecting Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield to play as large a part as they did. It really made a difference in my assessment of the movie. Tom Holland has some great moments. Tobey is as solid as ever. What a powerhouse actor Andrew Garfield has become. I hope he is nominated for the Tammy Faye movie but he really puts a lot into this resurrection of his Peter Parker (even though his Spider-Man films were the weakest of the three versions, not at his fault). I hope they don't use the same terrible wig for Benedict Cumberbatch in the next movie, yikes! That's really the worst thing about this movie. It may not be the best written or directed Marvel movie, but it's solid and a heavy hitter on nostalgia and humor, and the acting from the three Peter Parkers gives it the extra edge, especially if you appreciate the multiverse aspect of the story.", "Finally another great Marvel Movie!": "I honestly didn't expect too much from this film, after the last few Marvel movies have left me bored or they have been just plain bad. I was very pleasantly surprised, and really loved the \"nostalgic\" parts of the film that we got to see.Sadly I had to take off 1 star. I thought Jamie Foxx had redeemed himself after his last terrible Spiderman outing, until he opened his mouth to moan and complain that he wishes there was also a black spiderman...! WTF? There are enough great black actors, movies and parts out there, we don't need to constantly have stupid comments like that made in a movie. If I wanted to listen to politics I would put on the news. Just dump Foxx please, and whichever idiot decided to put that line in the movie.", "best spider man movie ever.....": "Near perfect event film, never seen a theatre cheer louder multiple times. The best non-avengers MCU film by far and probably only second overall to Infinity War. Oddly hilarious but quite emotional. They may only be theme park rides but I don't want to get off Mr. Bones' Wild Ride.", "Spiderman 3 - hence proved after watching this part": "Amazing entertainer.If u r really a Spidey fan just go and watch without even watching any review or anyone status..bcz if u go without surprise u will come and end with a lot of surprises and joyful enlightenment..\nWonderful screenplay and script..\nReally very hard to satisfy all the odds in order to make a movie like this..\nDon't expect me to say the story line in review.If u ask me I'll say\nOverall- this is 3 part of Spiderman and hence can be called as Spiderman 3 .U could doubt me why I have said this..but ull understand after watching the movie\nExcellent animation effects and kudos to the entire team.", "Lived up to all my expectations": "No words needed, absolutely fantastic movie. Everything felt natural and the characters and the story telling were great, I don't know how else to say it. The crowd in the cinema went wild!", "Spoiler free Review": "The best Spiderman movie ever. I hope that it reach atleast 2 Billion USD in box office! I have no words to express how amazing that movie is. The craze created by the trailer is so high that 5 lakh tickets worth Rs. 16.50 crores got sold in just 40 hours for advance bookings! And I would like to see Tom Holland as spiderman in future movies also!", "From another dimension": "This movie is one of a kind, despite borrowing the main concept from \"Into the Spider-Verse\". Even if you haven't watched the earlier movies with Tom Holland, for example, you'll still find this movie both amusing and thrilling. Watching the movie in theatres is highly recommended thanks to all the effects. It has a story underneath all that, which might have been forgotten due to all the visuals, but manages to web it all together so that it sticks.It also gives you a ride along the nostalgia train. Quiet simply a must-watch.", "The best Spider-Man movie ever!!!": "It's so goood! It's amazing! It's interesting and suspenseful. It does get boring( for like 3 min.), but is good! Action sequence is also good. I mean it is awesome. 9.5/10. Endgame is still better by a long shot.", "A perfect good-bye to Spider man from MCU": "The movie did live upto the expectations. Tom Holland's acting really improved so much from his previous films in MCU.The movie is all about spider man and Peter Parker...\nA spectacle to behold for Spidey fans.Literally, I thought two eyes weren't enough in some scenes and I'm not exaggerating here.The best spiderman movie of all time without a doubt.", "Amazing, I mean Incredible, I mean...": "I loved this film.It's a Fan Service Festival.I was simply disappointed with the lack of maturity and of the censorship that sometimes make us ask if the wounds suffered by some characters are deadly or not.", "The best Spider man film Ever": "This film done with all Spiderman franchise perfect. They back from the past incredible things. The story is perfect. Action scenes are incredible. Everything in this film are the best. This the best Marvel film I watch in my life.", "What a treat": "As well as superb writing and acting this is an action movie with heart. The action scenes are stunning but it never loses sight of the emotional story. Enjoyed every single second of the 2 and a half hours.", "borrrrrring": "If only tom Holland had been in the movie,the movie would never have gotten this far.The whole movie owes to dr.strange and two other Spider-Man and enemies that come from the world of two other Spider-Man.", "\"Swing into Action with 'Spider-Man: No Way Home': A Web of Intrigue and Laughter\"": "Well, folks, I'm here to tell you about the latest Spider-Man movie, \"No Way Home.\" And let me tell you, it's a doozy!First off, the special effects are top-notch. I mean, I felt like I was actually swinging through the city with Spider-Man. And the storyline, well, it's a web of intrigue that will have you on the edge of your seat.But, let's talk about the humor. Oh, the humor! It's not your typical superhero flick, folks. It's got some real zingers that'll have you laughing out loud. I mean, I don't want to give too much away, but let's just say that there's a scene involving J. Jonah Jameson that'll have you in stitches.Now, some folks might say that the movie is a bit confusing, what with all the different versions of Spider-Man and the villains from different universes. But let me tell you, it all comes together in the end in a satisfying way.All in all, I give \"No Way Home\" two thumbs up. And if you're a fan of the web-slinger, or just in the mood for a good laugh and some heart-pumping action, you won't want to miss this one!", "Top tier Marvel": "After a few rewatches, my Initial score was 10/10 but that was just me being excited. I would now give the movie a 8.4/10.This is the best Tom Holland Spider-Man film by a mile in my opinion. He isn't overshadowed anymore and is entirely on his own without help from iron man or nick fury (not actual nick fury). The movie is emotional and filled with great action. The pacing is good and the acting is solid as well.Overall, it's definitely in my upper tier of marvel movies and is something I will rewatch a ton more in the future. Best film since Endgame.", "Start of a new era....": "For a Marvel fan this movie is fantastic with a lot of touching moments, good fighting and well written dialogues, it's one of the best Marvel movies ever that's for sure.", "Probably my favorite MCU movie": "I grew up watching and loving the Tobey Maguire movies. Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man was okay but I didn't really like the movies itself. And Tom Holland with his awesome realtionship to Robert Downey Jr. Aka Tom Hollands Spider-Man with Tony Stark was pretty good too.My only problem with the first two and especially the first Tom Holland movies was that he didn't gave me those \"Spider-Man-Vibes\" and was more like a \"little Iron Man\" than Spider-Man. But this wasn't the fault of Tom Holland but of the screenplay and the need to fit into the MCU.But the first good thing in this movie was that Tom Hollands Peter Parker now has become a \"true\" Spider-Man. What I mean with that is, that he has problems he need to solve by himself, conflicts with himself (The \"hate\" from publicity and the death of May) and isn't Tonys or SHIELDS little boy anymore. He just gets more depth and emotional scenes so I can identify more with him.The next good thing about this movie is of cause the return of Tobey Maguires and Andrew Garfields Spider-Men and with them all the villains we know and love already. Such many nostalgic moments and a really great cinema experience.Furthermore I was surprised that in this movie I really liked the humor that I'm usually tired of in other MCU movies. But the chemistry between the three Spider-Men and between the three protagonists of the Tom Holland Trilogy works pretty good in my opinion.So all in all \"No Way Home\" is first of all a better Spider-Man-Movie as the previous two with the addition of nostalgic characters and secondly finally a MCU movie that has humor as well as emotional scenes which work and gave more depth to the characters. Finally a really great cinema experience again with a marvel movie.", "Insane": "Probably the greatest movie of any genre of all time. That is all. But seriously, this film had everything one could possibly hope for and desire from a Spider-Man/ Marvel movie. I would give it 100 stars if I could. This is some mighty fine work from all involved.", "The best marvel movie ever": "Story and acting are perfect... i really enjoyed this movie.. i think this is the best marvel movie... i cried few times for some sad scenes...you must watch this... !!", "Best Spider-Man Movie yet!": "No Way Home is a fantastic Spiderman film with plenty of action throughout. Amazing to see older Spiderman movie characters like Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield. Villains include Doc Ock, the brilliant Green Goblin, Sandman, Electro and the Lizard. Sad scenes include Aunt May sadly dying in Spidermans arms and Peter using a spell casted by Doctor Strange which makes everyone forget Peter is Spiderman.Brilliant acting by everyone involved and a moving soundtrack! 10/10 movie would happily rewatch it ASAP.", "Surpassed the Expectations!!": "The ratings reflects everything. Nostalgia, Epic Visual effects and multiple morals makes the movie a masterpiece.Also the movie is bright, doesnot contain any forced slowmotion and is also safe for the ears.", "Watched this twice and still can't process it": "This movie is stuck in my head. I have no idea how to get it out of my head besides watching the movie over and over again. The fact that I don't believe this movie is real should say EVERYTHINGToby was on the screen at the same time as Tom and Andrew and they actually interacted with each other!! How is this a real life movie this feels all too fake.The green goblin was absolutely terrifying in this movie and the fight scenes were just amazing. I cannot continue to exclaim my joy. I need this movie to get all the rewards and everything I don't care I'm a huge fan of MCU and Spider-Man and I can safely say..THIS IS THE BEST AND WILL BE THE BEST MCU MOVIE EVER CREATED.", "Not too bad": "Not even close to a 10 so I guess these other folks saw a different movie. It moved well with a couple slow way too much talking about feelings scenes.Now the help everyone cost be damned stuff is annoying and detracts from the movie. Putting people in danger to try to help someone is foolish at best.Worth seeing for sure but in way is this some game changer of a movie MCU wise.", "Schizophrenic Plot: Mostly Enjoyable until it was Not": "I like Tom Holland's light-hearted take on the Spider-Man character, but can't get over how petite he is compared to most superheroes. His girlfriend is taller than he is, just as Kim Basinger was taller than Michael Keaton's Batman. It's an old-fashioned prejudice that makes them look less awesome to me.SPOILER AHEAD:\nNo Way Home has good comedy and great special effects...but the final outcome just felt out of place for the overall tone of the movie. In an attempt to gain acceptance to his desired college, Peter Parker gets Dr. Strange to screw around with other people's minds on global scale, and in a comedy of errors, Peter interrupts the \"forget-you\" spell causing terrible side effects. Then he physically prevents Dr. Strange from correcting the timelines!The problem I have with the story is how Peter's selfish wish ends up costing the life of a loved one...In what was mostly an action comedy, those two plot points just don't fit. The loved one didn't have to die. She could've suffered only bruises, but the writers wanted another tragedy for Spider-Man, bigger than losing his Uncle Ben...or father figure, Tony Stark.And after years of telling us that folks should not mess around with the Timeline for fear of altering history...Peter does it five times over! No Way Home is like a lot of movies today. They want you to just put your brain on hold, eat popcorn and don't think. (How the Hell is the Goblin just as strong as Spider-man...who can catch automobiles, stop trains, and The Winter Soldier's arm? No Way.)", "Oh my, oh my, oh my !!": "Most amazing movie!!.. the movie tries to give the best of fan moments .. everything about this movie is amazing.. totally worth watching in the theaters..", "Every Spidey Fan Must Watch In Theater": "I don't know what to say, where to start. I was speechless after I left the cinema right now it has been 2 days and I am still speechless. For me, it is not possible to evaluate this movie with putting emotions aside. Because I believe that sometimes everything that normally matters suddenly become unimportant when emotions come into play. I can assure you this movie is one of those times. I could talk about how this movie just great by itself alone. However, when you consider the first two movies of this trilogy when you step back and see larger picture you realize that what Marvel tried to do with Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. No Way Home perfectly integrates \"Home\" trilogy and gives us \"real\" Spider-Man we used to know. I chose my title on purpose because in some scenes I think everyone must see and feel them in theater and maybe express them enthusiastically. I would loved that movie even just because particular scenes and I am sure that when you see it you will justify me.", "Arrh another childish Marvel movie.": "No wonder why Martin Scorsese call these marvel movies are Theme Park. This movie is nothing special just a nostalgia bait with old actors and every 10 mins are full of lame jokes this made even more terrible to experience the movie. It's also sad to see this movie rank 19 on Imdb that's a disrespectful to cinema. Just skip this trash if you want real cinematic masterpiece go watch Denis Villeneuve Dune it's 10x better than this trash and also got 10 nominee in Oscars.", "Perfectly balanced, as all things should be!": "The movie is simply phenomenal. From the acting to the CGI, the score and the cinematic feeling, No Way Home delivers on all fronts. Going from a more goofy teen-action film like \"Far From Home\" into a more serious Spiderman film like \"No Way Home\", brought me exactly what I needed from the Tom Holland movies.The stakes feel higher than ever before and the nostalgia of the old iconic characters made this movie entertaining the whole way through!If you want to get the most out of this movie, make sure to watch the old Spiderman movies so you understand the personalities and motives of the villains. If you don't do this, you will not get the full understanding, experience and satisfaction.Where I live, I have NEVER experienced people clapping mid way through a movie and yelling of excitement. People are good at respecting each other's needs to have a calm and good cinema-experience, but the hype, anticipation and delivery of this film was SO GOOD, that the whole atmosphere of the cinema was filled with energy and love for this movie. Everyone clapped, cheered, cried and laughed. It was truly an experience.", "Cried My Eyes Out": "This movie was everything I needed it to be.

Sure, somethings might not make seanse and it might be best to read about previous happenings a little bit but for what it is, it sure is a banger. Action packed and entertaining movie with everything from sorrow to great jokes and amazing CGI.

Yes .This is were the movie shines brightest ;bringing together three generations of Spider-Men. Uniting Tom Holland's Webslinger with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's versions, the film is an absolute joy for Spidey fans. This is where the movie really picked up the pace and nostalgia rush is when they introduce the past generations of Spider-Man in particular Tobey Maguire with a decent dose of William Dafoe for good measure !!! Dafoe and Maguire are the scene stealers in the movie.The second half of the movie I did a 180 and I started really really enjoying the film. Interaction between the past villains and the past Spider-Man from a generation of films really was a brilliant idea. This film not only appeals to fans of Marvel, but to Science Fiction fans as well.

I was never informed just cam on to add a bit extra in reply to another review regarding this universes (Tom Holland) Spiderman being too \"moralistic \".. the person seems to miss the point of why he was like this, at the point that he decided not to allow doctor strange to send back the respective villains to their own universe to die at the hands of/due to the actions of there respective Spiderman's is, that he had not gone through the same loss as the other 2 that's the point it not until he looses his aunt may that we see him turn and try and kill one of the villains only to then be stopped by one of the other Spiderman's who he had, inexplicably saved also, he not only saved the villains but also the other versions of him self allowing them to come to terms with their own daemons!As for doctor strange helping this one person... well they kind of saved the world together, he fought died and then was revived all in the fight against Thanos. He saved doctor strange's life, he was a super hero and also he was a child who still needed protecting so doctor strange did what he thought best and used compassion something that if you had watched the doctor strange movie he severely lacked at the beginning of his own movie!The movie its self was very good, defiantly the best of the 3, the first i did not like at all as it was overly WOKE and also all about the suit rather than the Spiderman's abilities, which we know to be extreme catching a car, stopping winter soldiers punch and moving his arm with no effort etc. The second was a big improvement and this one was almost there with one or two annoying parts and plot holes!

There is not denying the fact that, It's the best Spidey movie to date, Tom Holland absolutely crushes the role with his strength and heart. It's his best Spidey movie and by far my favorite marvel movie after Endgame and IW.Doctor Strange, Ned and MJ, Aunt May, and Happy all are a delight to see and watch. John Watts has absolutely brought out his top game for marvel fans and made the movie exciting for them in ways that we seriously could not even fathom. The fan moments are INSANE!!! And the call banks to memes are hilarious and heartwarming.The action sequences are amazing with Doctor Strange and Spiderman sharing some of the best stuff together. Doctor Strange is also amazing and now kind of the main focus of the MCU. This movie gave me tears, excitement, adrenaline, and had me jumping off my seat and cheering in happiness several times. Just amazing from start to finish. The ending is satisfactory and heartwarming just as was required. Go watch this movie as soon as you can and get hitched with Tom Holland.", "Unfunny jokes, phoned in Tobey Maguire performance": "Ok this movie is not bad at all, however I cannot praise it and give it a 10.The first 20 minutes have some horrifcally edited fast paced non stop jokes.It is exactly what you see in the trailer so there is nothing new. Tom Holland does his best as Spider-man. He is a good cast member, however in this movie he becomes second fiddle to one of the worst characters ever. Ned. Every scene there is a joke being cracked whilst he is on the screen. It completely fell flat. Why so many jokes? It is weird. Andrew Garfield was great, but then it is joke after joke with Ned's gran or aunt or mum. Awkward humour that just does not work for me. Doc Ock was amazing. The way they made him good really was welcomed as deep down he was a good man. Goblin returning was great also. I cannot say the same for Sandman, he was so dull in Spider-man 3 and he is just as dull in this. Electro... ahh man, why change him? I am guessing Jamie Foxx said I am not returning looking blue.So his character and attitude change felt more like he was making a cameo. Again joke after joke after joke. Then we get Tobey. This was the thing I was looking forward to most. He felt awkward, lazy and out of place. I have been saying all year that I would love a Spider-man 4 but after seeing the way his character was handled I do not think I would want it any more. The movie is not bad, it is alright but just alright. To say this is better than Endgame is one of the weirdest things to say.Anyway peace. I expected more of Tobey. Less jokes, much less jokes.", "One of the greatest Spider-Man movies in decades": "For May,\nWith Great power comes great responsibility.

That's not how the spell works.So MJ's gonna forget about everything we've ever been through. Stop tampering with the spell. No Way Home is like Peters Parkers Endgame, and 2nd chance to restart what he was accused of, and have a second chance with MJ, and Ned. No Way Home sets up mini hints for a 3rd @venommovie and a sneak preview of Doctor Strange and the Multiverse, for early showings and Premiere showings. You will walk out of the theater crying, and during the film you will feel the sadness Peter does. Spider-Man: No Way Home had heart, emotion, and the love between a son, and a mother, that bond can never be broken. On the other hand, this is the first of these three films that has allowed Zendaya and Holland's chemistry to shine. In particular, she nails the emotional final beats of her character in a way that adds weight to a film that can feel a bit airy in terms of performance. The references they had to Spider-Man (2002), Spider-Man 2 (2004), Spider-Man 3 (2007), The Amazing Spider-Man (2012), and The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014). And it playfully becomes a commentary on correcting mistakes of the past not just in the life of Holland's Parker but those of characters (and even filmmakers) made long before he stepped into the role. \"No way Home\" is about the weight of heroic decisions. Even the right ones mean you may not be able to go home again. No Way Home is the story of life, death, love, 2nd chances, and the true person you are and how pure your heart it. Go Watch Spider- Man: No Way Home in theaters tomorrow (December 17,2021)", "Marvel-ous": "I will try to review this without spoilers, but the spoilers are what makes this movie marvelous. It will make more sense after you watch it, which I recommend you do. This movie is the culmination of the previous two decades of Spider-Man and the payoff was 100% satisfying. The acting was fantastic with all the key characters and villains. Tom Holland puts out a fantastic performance. There are so many cheers and shocks that make this movie a rollercoaster ride.", "With Great CGI fireworks comes a SENSELESS story": "With great CGI fireworks comes a SENSELESS story and Spiderman No Way home just proved to be yet another greatest \" MCU theme parks\" of all time, hence justifying Scorsese's thoughts on Superhero Cinema, something which MCU has been doing well since ages. It delivered beyond its fans' expectations by bringing characters from multiple universe ( by using cheap plot threads and lame excuses) and showing interesting interactions among them, which was only a dream for many till now. As action packed and humorous it's scenes were, some moments were emotional enough to make anybody cry. A solid experience for mediocre taste. 8.6/10.", "THE ABSOLUTE BEST SPIDERMAN MOVIE EVER MADE": "This movie is the best spiderman movie because it\u00b4s the combination of 20 years of productions, 3 generations of 3 very different spidermans and Peter Parkers. It\u00b4s the integration of the multiverse and the explanation with a bunch of new questions. This movie is a cinematic masterpiece, full of mementos for the real fans and full of excitement for the new ones.", "Best Spiderman Movie Ever Made": "This movie includes everything that a MEU and Spiderman fan ever expected.

I think some people are blinded by the fact that Andrew and Tobey are back. Its a great movie, but instantly knew it was going to be overrated. It had great cgi, great acting, great ending, mid plot and over all a really good movie. But the cinema experience made people think the movie is better than it is. Definitely worth the watch!", "Spider-Man has taken the throne!": "After watching the last two Spider-Man movies, I was expecting just another run of the mill MCU movie. (adventures, a few jokes, web slinging, damsel in distress, saving the day) This movie delivers the same formula we have all grown to love, however, this time it has turned up the excitement 1000%. I was truly engaged throughout the entire film and it kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. Just when I thought it couldn't get better, BOOM, it got better. All in all, I think Avengers Endgame might be dethroned. Fantastic movie. They really created something magical here. Go see it.

You will regret it if you don't watch it in the cinema.", "Perfect": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is a phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy and Holland's best outing as Spidey yet. Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.", "Best of the best": "Was a really good movie seeing that they give us what we want is a very good thing damn when i saw andrew and toby i shout like a crazy guy thank you marvel for this film will be in our mermories always.", "Hands down one of the best Marvel movies": "This movie blew my mind, literally. I was waiting so excitedly for this film and it did way more than blow my expectations. I grew up on the Tobey and Andrew spider-man's and just seeing them come together and clash personalities just made me so happy. I have no words, after the movie ended I just couldn't get out any words. When they came on screen I screamed and clapped. They got what they deserved, Andrew saving MJ and Tobey stopping Holland from killing Green Goblin. Something fans have been waiting for. In a way this movie satisfied fan expectations but also opened a new realm for every other Marvel movie. Marvel has outdone themselves again, I can't wait to see what else they can come up with.", "One of the best mcu movie!!": "Actually no need to say too much, there are a few situations to critisize but its perfect. This film contains great scenerio, super musics, nostalgia, fantastic dialogues, comedy, sadness, deep emotions all in one! Despite bringing Andrew and Toby back we also saw Charlie Cox as Matthew Murdock in the MCU and at the end, the film leads to the real-solo spiderman movie with Tom Holland. Can't wait to see it! Best Spiderman Movie for sure even maybe the best MCU movie along with the Infinity War!It is 10/10 from 9.5/10 :)", "Why not forget about Spider-Man instead?": "Ok I know, if they chose to forget about Spider-Man, or to forget about the connection between Peter Parker and Spider-Man , the movie might not have happened, but seriously, why can't they at least address these two options? It really bugged me towards the end. Pun intended ...They had to choose to forget about Peter Parker ...", "Really sorry but I did NOT enjoy this!": "A plot based upon the main character's stupidity is not entertaining no matter how good the fight sequences or how beautifully it ties up loose ends.The ending was admittedly strong but getting there was a huge slog. The movie has two huge flaws: First, there is way too much extraneous material crammed in which adds nothing to the plot. (Would someone please explain to me what the whole police interrogation sequence has to do with anything?) Second, the main factor driving the story forward is Peter Parker screwing things up. If he had acted with a little common sense the whole movie would have wrapped up in 30 minutes. (At one point, Dr. Strange even points this out to him.)", "6.8": "This movie is widely overrated. The plot is mushed together, and it does not flow as well as it should. I don't understand why marvel can't make plot choices and everything has to be resolved in the end. I'm glad that they killed off Aunt May or this movie would've been a 5. Disney never makes definitive plot choices in any of their franchises and it's going to make their movies flat and cheesy.", "The best MCU movie": "I never write reviews but this movie deserves one and I must say that this movie is incredible and is amazing if you are a big Sci-Fi and superhero nerd like I am. It is one of those movie that should be watched in cinema and if not that then it must be watched in 4K. I can't speak highly enough about the joy I experience watching this movie and I think I might have to watch again in the cinema which is another thing I never do.Spider-Man No Way Home is an incredible addition to the MCU but can only be enjoyed fully if you have watched every other Spider-Man movie. Overall it is in my opinion a 10/10.", "The perfect Christmas gift!": "Finally, something good to end this horrendous year. It was a terrible year filled with tragedies for me but this made me smile!

But it turned out to be\nan ordinary Marvel movie with the Action - Comedy - Action formula. Some times, this tone change is very irritating too. The story has mostly a lazy writing and too convenient (like cooking up cures in one night..)One thing this movie revels in is the fan service. There are many nostalgic moments for the fans. But to others, it is just an average movie.", "Pretty good albeit everything wrong with Hollywood": "Good CG and gave me a good old nostalgia dopamine hit but it's not the high art some are describing here.Given this is one of the few success of the pandemic I suspect we're in for more trips down memory lane in leui of some original ideas.

After the events of the last spiderman film, peters identity is now exposed to the world and everyone suddenly belives he is a murderer. That is apart from ned, mj his aunt may and happy. We also get strange in this movie who was a treat but really we need to talk about the meat of the movie. Or should we say spidey seeing triple. Yes thats it we are graced with two familer faces that help parker out. Plus there are some old villians that have come to say hello.

It's your typical 15 year old marvel movie with many plot holes and 0 things which would provoke any thought. And it also won't make you feel anything special.", "Sad to say this: Disappointing": "I understand all the excitement around Spider Man: No Way Home. I was also extremely excited with this movie (and I'm not a big Marvel fan), however, I was disappointed with the final result.The idea of Spider Man having his identity revealed it's genius and challenging. How Marvel decided to approach it not so much.The movie quickly solves the prospect of Peter going to jail or facing criminal charges. Now, the real problem is that the trio (Ned, Peter and MJ) can't go to university and their life's is completely ruined... So, to solve all his problems Peter asks Doctor Strange to cast a spell so that everyone forgets that Peter Parker is Spider Man. Except, Mj. And Ned. And Aunt May. Surprise surprise: something goes wrong and villains that fought different versions of Spider Man in other realities appear in this reality. The whole scene is a little childish and I was surprised of how ridiculous this scene was. It was getting kinda predictable that something would go wrong.So now Peter has to solve the problem he created. He and Doctor Strange easily capture all the villains but instead of making them go back to their own reality, Peter fights Doctor Strange because he believes that he can help these mentally disturbed villains (Again, childish). After taking out Doctor Strange (in another great action scene), he takes them to his house (in fact Happy's house) and tries to help them, but things get out of control. No one was expecting that...\nAunt May gets killed by Green Goblin after a great fight scene between Spider Man and him. The scene is really exciting and well orchestrated. But the death scene is jus outstanding and almost made me cry. Not only the acting is on top (Tom Holland once again proves himself as a great actor and shows the depth he can give to the character) but also the way Jon Watts chose to show us the feelings and the pain of Peter it's LOVELY. It's an amazing scene that stops me from giving a 6/10 to this movie. It's an excellent work by Jon Watts. Hats off.Now (once again) Peter has to solve this mess.Fast forward: Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield Spider Man's appear and the three Spider Man's save the day with an ultimate sacrifice by Peter Parker (Tom Holland), who lets everyone forget who he is to avoid the ULTIMATE MESS. You know the story so let me tell you some more.I felt that this movie was too funny... and this is a bad thing. Having some comedy in this type of movies (as we've seen in basically all Marvel Movies) is good. After an intense action movie, a good joke is quite pleasant. What's unpleasant and truly a shame is turning a, supposedly, more serious movie into a comedy. There are just too much jokes and many of them are unnecessary. It makes me feel that producers didn't knew what to make of this movie and just decided to make loads and loads of jokes. Some of them are really funny, others not so much.A reunion of villains and heroes from the past movies it's also something risky. Some of the villains (such as The Lizard or whatever his name was) didn't help the story at all and had little screen time. I also think that Electro was the weirdest villain. He had this great power that (I feel) was not unloaded and too easily taken down. This character was probably the strongest but didn't really affect too much the story.And, for the last, my main critique: the multiverse. It's a complete mess (I am using this word way too much) that it's going to create endless plot holes. This movie is probably full of plot holes but I don't want to dive into it. Search if you want :)Now, the good things about this movie.The action, not being something outstanding, is good. I liked it. Jon Watts shows once more that he is capable of achieving levels of emotion that I was not expecting for a superhero movie. Tom Holland, again, shows how good of an actor he is. It's a funny movie and you'll laugh for sure.Overall, the movie has everything it needs to be an amazing movie, but falls short of its greatness due to a weak story development. However, if you are looking for a funny and entertaining movie to end the year... there you go! It's worth it.PS: If you think I'm being too harsh with the movie, keep in mind that I'm already into another type of movie and so, coming back to watch Marvel movies it's always harder than it was 3/4 years ago when I was 13. Because, after all, Marvel is made for 13 years old kids... and that's perfectly fine!", "I went to see this movie on Friday Spider-Man I give this film a 10": "I went to see this movie with my dad on Friday to see Spider-Man it was brilliant film around amend it to anybody to watch it it was so sad to watch it when all the characters in Spider-Man came back it was a beautiful film I'm glad when it comes out on 4K Blu-ray i'll give it to score 10 is the best movie what Marvel mate I hope we carry on having good movies like this like Spider-Man and I hope you makes another film he's a grown man now keep on the good work I went to see This in Vue Cinema in Shepherd's Bush in London in Westfield I love Marvel films this is much better and venom.", "A must watch movie": "Let me begin by saying, what an achievement this movie is. To bring this emsemble together paired with amazing visuals and score, the director has outdone himself. Hats off to the writers for such a plot. And to Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal, thank you. We love you 3000. For someone who's been a fan from Spider-Man 2002, this movie couldn't have been a better Spidey movie.It is hands down the best Spider-Man movie ever made it can even be considered the greatest Comic book film ever made. The movie already had too much hype going for it with Doc Strange joining the cast and when news broke of the casting of old villains.And when they delivered above and beyond that hype, that's where the true success of this film is.Coming to performances the whole cast was exceptional. Tom Holland keeps proving that he is a bottomless pit of talent.Zendaya gives a nuanced and matured performance as MJ and Benedict as usual knocks it out of the park .Usually Marvel films are earmarked with CGI slob fest when it comes to big fight sequences, but the way the director handled it in the movie is exceptional.I'm not doing any sppilers for this review, because I want people to experience it in theater just like I did. Hope you guys enjoy it.", "The 'home'run Spider-Man fans have been waiting for!": "My new favorite Spider-Man movie and easily in the top 3 Marvel movies.

Spider-Man is my favorite super hero. I always wanted a third Garfield Spider-Man movie. I love the idea of the story. However, the animated \"Into the Spider-Verse\" movie executed the idea much better.This movie just bogs down and gets too slow in the middle. It takes too long to get to McGuire and Garfield. I can't help but feel like this was a wasted opportunity, especially after seeing how effectively \"Into the Spider-Verse\" handled the story.All in all, I enjoyed it. But it could've been better.", "BEST SPIDEY MOVIE TILL DATE": "A thriller, action packed yet emotional movie and at times hilarious too ....All of the villians combined against our spidies........

These the types of shows will keep me interested at my age.", "Totally overrated": "I saw the movie with open mind.... its just getting too much. 3 spiderguys (2 from previous movies) and a story that lacks of innovation. Totally overfed with visiual computereffects which were overdone. I felt bored... really.", "Not much of a treat": "It was an ok movie. Some immature actors with a weak story with too much going on.Movie business now more dependent upon the advertisement and this movie it's fair share of it.", "Would've given it 4, but the deliberately lazy making forced a 1": "SPOILERS AHEAD! First off, the positives. The idea is really good and opened up so many ways in which the film could've gone. Willem Dafoe and Andrew Garfield give thoroughly entertaining performances, while the rest of the cast were pretty functional (yeah, Tobey seemed uninterested and JK Simmons was underutilized).Now, I know Spiderman is a kid and all that but why would he possibly choose to save guys who would've killed at least 30 people in the action scene that they appeared in? Because May spouted some pseudo-wisdom? I know it seems like nitpicking but that's such a glaring characterization error. Hence, the plot is weak and entirely reliant on nostlagia to save the day (which it does, for MCU fans).Raimi's trilogy really has good characters who actually have some chemistry between them and the scenes are wonderfully staged. In MCU spiderman, the laziness in filmmaking and production is evident. It's almost like Feige thought \"Okay we have this cool idea to bring back the other 2 so let's just whip up a movie\". Director Jon Watts' biggest hassle would've been to safeguard the secrecy of the cameos I guess. The CGI is awful in many scenes and the post credit scene which has a trailer for Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness shows a superior quality of making just from 1 or 2 minutes of footage.As an aspiring filmmaker myself, I felt really bad for other directors who have a voice and really want to tell a story and give a cinematic experience, in a world where films like FFH, Black Widow and NWH are what the mass audiences want. At least it's good for the theaters as PTA said.MCU is like the broiler chicken of film history. Filled with formulae and easy to make but long term impacts are, well...yet to be seen.P. S: I opened an IMDb account just to write this review.", "Best super hero movie of all time!": "It's a 20 year legacy and the execution didn't disappoint. It was so I hyped and I was afraid It wouldn't fulfill the hype bar, but IT DID. What a MASTERPIECE.", "Best one yet...yet...": "This is an excellent Spidey fan movie. Certainly the best of the current iteration and arguably best live action version ever (Spider-verse reigns supreme). The fan service is pretty cool, and the set pieces are spectacular. The serious drama pieces did not quite hit the top notes, and jokes elicit smiles rather than belly laughs...but overall worth going to see in the theatre. I think the franchise has yet another gear it could get into. 2nd end-credit is mind blowing for Marvel fans. Enjoy.", "The best Spider-Man": "I'm not going to say much.

Damn right I am, epic scenes in every moment.Aunt May's scene, massive.The saving of the prior villains and the redemption of Otto, FANTASTIC!But outside of these scenes, that are there for nostalgia, it's not that much.We had Spider-Man facing the real consequences of being a hero who isn't a billionaire who can buy mansions, a government agent or a god. And his life was in the toilet, terribly.That should've been the central driving plotline, where the things kept piling upon him until he has to make a decision that's about owning the responsibility of his role and would've worked better with the two other Spider-Men there to act as a bit of Mentor.Like I've said it's fun! And it's a wild ride, but it's not the amazing thing people are saying, it's largely a nostalgia trip and full of sugar.", "Greatest movie of 2021": "This was action-packed and I loved it. This was one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. Amazing scenes, and everything. Best of 2021! Epic for any Marvel or Spidey fan.", "Not the best Spider-Man movie.": "There were some cool moments. There was a lot of fan service. Everything seemed too conveniently put in place to cause an audience reaction. Most of the humor was too silly for my taste, with the exception of some jokes from the older members of the cast. I can't stand Zendaya as MJ, I don't like Ned, I don't like flash, and Tom Holland is my least favorite Spider-Man. If you want to see a pretty cool multiverse Spider-Man movie, watch Into the Spiderverse.

Its feel so forced and that it was done just to move the plot along.2. That Peter, a genius and prospective MIT student, would risk the fate of the world just to make people forget his identity; worse still, another genius who is more mature, Dr Strange, would agree to it and help him: even worse, they did not plan it out and mess up the spell!Overall so juch potential, but let down by childishly huge plotholes,", "Half of the movie is trash, half is world class": "This review will be really short.THe first hour of this movie is pretty trash and is mostly a non sense plot where all the characters do dumb things.But after this part, the movie is doing a world class job.

Zendaya her usual pretentious poser act.", "Just a Fan Service, but no mystery and no character development": "This movie felt like Avengers Endgame. It is just a big fan service by packing all spiders and spider enemies in one movie. The story itself is straightforward with no real surprises and you know what will happen after the first 30 minutes. The next 2 hours are very predictable and really just fan service.I am kind of bored by the current \"Marvel formula\". The world has changed, the first Spider-Man movie. In 2002, for the very first time, we saw a realistic Spider-Man swinging through New York City. That was mind-blowing! But today, we have seen these almost perfect CGI scenes over and over again. It is nothing new anymore. It is not mind-blowing any more.What we DO need is good character development, exciting and non-predictable story paths. Some mystery and awe.There is a difference between Comics and Movies. There are soo many ways to pencil a fighting scene in a comic, so many different styles and ways to change between close-up and open-up scenes. In contrast, a movie fighting scene, especially for super-heros, looks almost always the same. So it gets boring, now that we have seen all in the last 20 years.For this reason, \"Eternals\" is still my favorite Marvel post-covid movie. Here they tried something else. It was very refreshing and still has amazing cinematography.", "Old Treat": "Well i went to feel up about my 15 year old memories.

It has action, drama, feels just what a movie needs. I think Andrew Garfield stole the show man. Dude was so good i even forgot that i am a huge tobey fan. Every scene he was on i was touched by his performance. You can tell how much he loves being as spiderman. Even the inside joke as him being as the worst one among them the apiderman trio that made me sad. His performance was great but the script and movie overall didn't do his performance justice. I Hope we can see him as spiderman in future too. I don't think tobey will reprise his role as our beloved web swinger but i can understand that. The villains were good but Jamie Fox and William Defoe's performance were absolutely amazing. Other villains were just there didn't had that much impact on the movie in my opinion. There are some decisions i wasn't ok with how peter parker carried on with but that's just me. Wished Venom had came out to fight spiderman but that didn't happened. I am ok with the end credit scene though it kinda made up for it.", "The fan services save the film": "A poor script. The filme without what everyone knows what he has, was terrible.

Where you whatch for the second time, you will understand my point.", "So very well done!": "There are no words that can describe how good this movie is but I'll try my best : BEYOND PHENOMENAL!!! Do not hesitate go ahead and enjoy every second of this masterpiece!!! The story, the visuals, the characters, the acting performances, the suprises, the laughs, tears, heartbreaks and promises. Sooooo good.", "No spoilers": "Its was a bit basic, most of the things were predictable, the story has so much holes and doesnt make sense for half the story.

I loved watching this movie. It made the villains in the Andrew Garfield trilogy look good: and considering how dumb they were that's impressive. It gave justice to all the previous villains, who didn't get more than one movie to shine, until now. This movie was simply starstruck with Oscar winners, brilliant actors and so much more. This movie gave me faith in Marvel, who, of recent have given me little to smile about. Spiderman, regardless of how bad the movie is, is always going to be my favourite character in Marvel, and I think this film showed how well all 3 actors played Spiderman and deserved their roles. I'm not gonna complain about this film, because while it's not perfect, it's not been given the Metascore it deserves, to say this movie is 2 hours long and so engaging. 10/10 - drag yourself to the cinema even in covid.", "A love letter to the fans": "Spoiler freeIf you grew up watching the seven previous Spider-Man movies, you will not be disappointed.My partner-in-crime and I watched them all in anticipation of this release and I recommend doing the same if you want to get the most out of this film.The all-star cast put in some of the best performances of the entire franchise and the story arcs conclude in a satisfying fashion.It's silly, it's camp - it's Spider-Man. What more can you ask for than fun, theatrical entertainment at Christmastime?Bravo. A showing I will never forget. Merry Christmas!", "Awesome movie \ud83c\udf7f": "The movie was good with almost a sinister 6 villain and the three Spideys <3 along with Strange and all the sorcery.The only reason why my rating isn't 10 is because there are a few unanswered questions for me, like what happened to both the Harry Osbornes? If there's Elektra, shouldn't there be Harry's Goblin? Also, there's a Venom tease and a Miles Morales tease. Hope we see them soon too! And there are a couple of Venoms too, across the multiverses...

There was just enough action and just enough heart and soul involved. The whole reunion of the other spider-man's was a brilliant and exciting surprise.

I think the balance of pushing the story forward and reintroducing fan-favorites is absolutely masterful. WE can definitely say that the emotive aspect is undoubtedly a menagerie of 3 Peter Parker's dealing with loss and finding sibling-love through each other.", "Enjoyable, but overstuffed": "All 7 prior Spiderman movies are required viewing, otherwise this film is a mess of flat characters who feel like they're there to cry a bit, crack some jokes, then leave. So my primary fear was right, with the four villains feeling undercooked, Green Goblin being the only one to actually do anything, and the other two Spidermen being there so that Tom Holland didn't have to work to solve half the issues. Tobey felt like he was there to pick up a paycheck. But Andrew Garfield, he was actually the best Spiderman in this. His character here felt like a natural conclusion to TASM 2, starting with him still mourning Gwen to getting back on his feet and coming to his own as Spiderman again, even getting to talk to and comfort Max after solving the power trip he went on as Electro like he had tried to do in TASM 2. That was the best part of the film. Beyond that, this was basically a Doctor Strange movie that sidelined Doctor Strange for the second act. It had some okay ideas and wasn't terribly written, but it was too overstuffed to capitalize on those ideas. Oh, and Matt Murdock was there for like two minutes.Overall, it's an enjoyable film improved by knowing the prior Spiderman movies, but still flawed and overhyped.", "Best MCU movie!": "Honestly, I can't find anything wrong with this movie, it is entertaining, nostalgic and action packed. In my opinion, this is the best superhero film of all time!", "Best Marvel movie so far": "Perfect blend of callbacks to past films, a perfect wrap to the current story arc with perfect set-ups for new stories and characters. 10/10 will gladly pay to watch this again.", "this is what you live for": "Look. I live in a small country in Europe. I hardly go to the cinema, mostly because movies had changed in the past years and i don't really get that excitement i used to get back in the days. I remember watching the clip on yt of the release of the first Spiderman where people on cinema go wild and i always wished i was there... No Way Home managed to make that dream come true \ud83d\ude01 at the premiere in my hometown it was a nerd fest!!! People were clapping and shouting and you could hear people from the front and back row making all sort of plots about whats going to happen, it was fenomenal!!!

A huge W for our fanbase, W movie, W everything.The story was quiet good. Very little to no flaws and the plot made perfect sense. The pacing and dialogue were enjoyable also. It was a roller coaster of emotions from good to bad and the actors did a great job amplifying it. The music and visuals were top notch and the directing was sensational.It was one hell of a movie probably one of the best by Marvel. Overall it was quiet an enjoyable movie.Memorable? : So so Rewatchable?: Likely..", "nice cast": "This is a movie made purely to satisfy the fans and there should be no doubt about that. No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland.", "A filler movie with some nostalgia elements": "The entirety of movie is just a series of one stupid decision after other, asking for help to fix the previous one and then again messing it all up out of irrational and impulsive last second choices repeatedly. I cannot fathom how the cast members portrayed as MIT aspirants and also other grown up adults could collectively be so ignorant and bad at decisions that lead to the plot of this entire movie of just fixing one stupid decision after other. It is just a filler movie which contains homage to the spiderman fans using some nostalgic characters and the plot setup for another upcoming marvel movie of different character which could've done so much sensibly and better than just a very forgettable movie with poor sense of judgements. This has turned out to be the most stupidest spiderman of all 3.", "WHY DIDN'T I WATCH THIS ON THE CINEMA?": "A great power is also come with the great responsibility - it's always iconic. I love it.My regret is \"why didn't I see this at the cinema?\" well I'm in a village that doesn't have a cinema \"but why don't I try to get out of town?\" ah, I'm sorry.Spider man is my favorite superhero since forever. For reason.

This movie is tailor made for the fans of the Spiderman franchise though it is a bit different in some aspects. Firstly, just like the Avengers series two other actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield are roped in make appearances along with Tom Holland. (This is not a spoiler since their names and characters are mentioned in cast in Google). An interesting scene has all 3 having a chat about their experiences in their respective universes. Sample this \" Did you ever get caught with no more web in your hands ?\" and \" Who was the deadliest enemy you fought ?\". Secondly , how would you feel if your superhero is battered, injured, dejected and down in the dumps ? Or better still can you imagine that Spiderman (or Peter Parker if you like) and his two friends want to join MIT ? The usual set of villains are there and Dr Strange ( Cumberbatch) has his magic powers to help out Spiderman. Also their adventures enhanced with mind blowing special effects are there in plenty. A few one liners placed intermittently do amuse. Spiderman's romantic interest MJ (Zendaya) is around though she is now Michelle Jones not Mary Jane. An evil one liner to remember is \" No good deed goes unpunished\". When all 3 form a team to kick evil ass, one Spiderman complains that he is not used to fight in a team! Fair enough. Where does Spiderman go when he is sad ? To the top of the Empire state building, of course.", "Plot deserves a separate movie following EndGame": "This movie was able to conveniently tie so many strings together and play around with Spider-Man without ruining the evolution of the original DC Superhero. It blows my mind.I just sat here for 5 minutes scrolling and cringing through the 1 star section of this movie from the soulless idiots who achieved the impossible: walking out of the movie theatre unsatisfied.If you really find this movie terrible, why don't you go ahead and remake it and see if you can get a better outcome.

So, I'm probably missing the 'how Spider Man got to this point' angle. But I really enjoyed the movie. There are so many angles brought together.

As a life-long fan of the character, I feel lucky to have seen this evolve into such a fun, entertaining story. I really have to question the attention spans or comprehension of those who criticize the film for having \"too many characters\" or being too long. There are ADD medicines out there, so I don't understand why they wouldn't avail themselves. Lol. But hey, maybe people who can't keep track of more than 4 characters in a movie should stick to primetime sitcoms or one-person musicals.

I don't think i can ever watch something as good as it.", "The third Tom Holland solo installment goes multiverse and delivers a lot of fan service": "By MCU movie standards this third solo movie with Tom Holland as Spiderman needs nearly 30 minutes to set-up the premisse: Everybody knows who Peter Parker is and his best friends and him suffer from this popularity and the aftermath of the death of Mysterio.Peter visits Doctor Strange and then the next 2 hours of this movie are a sentimental (you could call it retro), action-packed emotional wild ride.The special effects are top notch, the camera work is extetic masterful, the direction is flawless.*** SPOYLER ON ***If something is flawed, it's the script/the story with all its logic breaks, the major one being:\nIt's not about timetravel, it's about letting everybody forget that Peter Parker is Spiderman by a spell by Doctor Strange. But, all the video evidence by Mysterio, all the news, newspapers, blogs and and and are not wiped out. So it makes no sense to erase peoples minds about the true identity of Spiderman. Point.The character Electro is written quite pale.To fix the villains is a cool idea, and how it's done with Dr. Otto Octavius (Doc Ock) is ok, also how Max Dillon (Electro) might get fixed is ok, but the antidotes for Norman Osborn (The Green Goblin) and Dr. Curt Connorsto (The Lizzard) being created just like that in a homemade laboratory don't make any sense.*** SPOYLER OFF ***There are some inconsistencies and minor logic breaks, but then just remember: It's a comic book universe with supernatural elements and it's not about a realistic psychological drama.Spiderman/Tom Holland gets the chance to show a wide spectrum of character development and delivers finally his best performance.Really cool: The other spiderman incarnations Tobey Maquire and Andrew Garfield get fantastic scenes and it's a joy to watch the treesome of spidermen.Finally, the multiverse arrived to the spiderman franchise and we'll see what upcoming spiderman movies will deliver.Prepare for a huge MCU movie.Highly recommended.", "Nostalgia!": "Epic movie with all your expectations fullfiled!Tom holland displayed all emotions perfectly!Get ready to be entertained with two and half hours of amazing action humour emotions and story!Marvel never disappoints!", "Spiderman no way home! Awesome!": "Movie was awesome, had a lot of action happening, while watching the movie I wasn't board. A lot of action and old character references in the movie!Personally I recommend this to someone who is a marvel fan you will enjoy this!", "The most emotional and memorable cinematic experience i have ever had": "This movie delivered everything a fan can ever want , the goosebumps were real. Haven't seen the whole theater go roaring like that since captain America said the famous words \" Avengers Assemble\".Seriously don't know how can marvel ever top this.Thanks for the wonderful experience Marvel and everyone involved,", "\"You'd still be the only thing I ever needed you to be: a fever dream\"": "It is impossible to talk about this movie without mentioning anything spoiler-ish, so here's your last warning.I always try to look at movies as a an art piece and as a form of entertainment. So, I'll do the same thing for this movie as well (however unfair that may sound).1) From an artistic perspective, this movie is amazing. While the editing is sleek, the cinematography is gorgeous. The \"Mirror universe\" scene is just breathtaking. The 2 minute long take is also just wow, something straight out of a Safdie Brothers movie. And the color palette, my god, is it perfect. In one word, the movie feels alive. When it comes to acing, everyone does a great job, but Tom Holland knocks it out of the park. He actually goes through an array of emotions, heavily leaning on dread and sadness, but there are just enough sprinkles of fun, so as not to be dull. In my opinion, Andrew and Tobey did a phenomenal job as well, Andrew in particular. But the real winner, in my opinion, is Defoe. He is just so good at playing the Green Goblin. The horrific laughter from Sam Raimi's trilogy is back and it is so horrifically and perfectly corny, as it should be.2) This is when the fun begins. Being a Spider-Man fan since I was in second grade in elementary school (now I am 17), I have always adored the Sam Raimi trilogy. When Amazing Spider-Man came out, I kinda zoned out and forgot about them. Homecoming was all I wanted for a modern iteration to be, while Far From Home was just okay. Lastly, I've never really fallen in love with Into the Spider Verse. Just before watching No Way Home, I rewatched all live-action Spidey movies. I loved the general early 2000s feel of Sam's trilogy, I was *amazed* by khm khm Garfield's completely different Spidey and I simply fell in love with Homecoming. But I was not hyped per se for this one, as I was afraid of being let down. Nevertheless, the movie lived up completely. The biggest plus is that the other Spider-Men actually did something. I was afraid that they were going to be a deus-ex machina of sorts, but they actually were in the movie and more importantly *HAD THEIR ARCS COMPLETED*. Garfield's, by saving MJ, finally felt what he wanted to when Gwen was in the same near-death situation. On the other hand, Tobey's was already completed beforehand, so he was just there. The villains were more or less good, with the exception of Dr. Connors who was just there.Throughout the whole movies there were so many references done right, either to help the story or to be funny. Regardless, this was a cinema experience that I won't forget.", "This movie wrapped its webs around my heart": "I was so enthralled that I forgot to touch my popcorn.I was so scared of spoilers that I deleted Facebook for three days.This film made me cry so many times.I experienced pure joy, and deep sadness.There aren't enough words.So thankful this exists.", "Good but ratings definitely are fake": "Definately a good movie no doubt about that. But it's also silly. Special effects are top class. Story is nothing.. absolutely nothing. Humor is poor. If u r a 90s kid its nostalgic. Sad to see my spidey ( Tobey Maguire) looking old. Andrew Garfield has aged gracefully. He looks tha same he did 12 years back.", "God Damn what did i just watched": "This movie is a True gift to all Spider-man Fans i was smiling the entiremovie loved every second of it, thismovie is the best spider-man movie ever.8.7/10.", "Awesome movie, but...": "This is the best Spider-Man movie so far but it has one big flaw in my opinion. There's only two fights in the whole movie. There's a lot of comedy and drama but it lacks some more action. The potential of this movie and what they could've done with all the characters coming together is insane but sadly they didn't go crazy with it. Also, it would've been nice to have one more vilain who wasn't featured in any of the other movies. Just for the hell of it. Sure, it would've been a bit of a character overload but so was Infinity Wars and it worked. However. Great acting, story, writing and \"guests\".

Not sure if I have ever seen anything like this that explains a crossover in such a believable way although it was reminiscent of the Doctor Who special episodes with multiple versions.Could have been slightly cheekier with the character traits of the Peter Parkers (Garfield's sensitivity and Maguire's cheesiness) and could have included an original baddy but in all a bloody good film.", "Succinct in Sixteen": "Marvelous yet flashy and quick.

I RECOGNIZE THING ON SCREEN!!": "Natural. Warranted. Consistent. Well-written.All these are elements you will hardly find in this movie.Sometimes Marvel forgets that it has 20+ movies in its catalogue. They hope we forget that too.20+ Marvel movies with elements that would destroy the settings and plot of other, usually weaker. Marvel movies. This is one of them.Far from Home has a plot that only works if you choose to ignore what came before it and the movies it references.In a world where secret super hero identities are non-existent, the movie opens with Spider-man's identity being revealed by the villain from the previous movie. We are expected to think that it somehow means anything when the identity of Spider-man is revealed. This would be an issue if we were talking about previous incarnations of Spider-man as it was a real stake in their movies, not here though. This Peter Parker takes his mask off as soon as he enters 90% of the scenes he is in, so why is it a problem? It has not been a problem for literally any other hero in this world. If they wanted his identity to be a stake, they would have introduced this Spider-man apart from any other hero and unknown to them as well, right? Or else they would be somehow forced to reckon that in some convoluted way in order to make it so, right?Anyway, as Peter begins to get stalked and personally affected by mobs of people, he resorts to Dr. Strange for a mass mind-erasing spell that makes everyone forget he is Spider-man, risking everyone he knows forgetting his super hero alias... Not a spell that makes everyone forget what Mysterio said. Not a spell to revert time and prevent it. Other options would be to use a Skrull, whom aren't as detached to Spidey since he was around 2 of them in the last movie. I know that it would be harder to make it a conflict about Peter dealing with the problems of now becoming a public figure and absorbing the tremendous responsibility of now taking care of his loved ones while not giving up on being a hero. That would require work. And who wants to do work especially when the movie is going to sell like crazy anyway, right? Worked with Endgame...This spell goes wrong, as expected and it opens a portal that brings personalities that know Spidey's identity in their respective worlds and it now brings references and memes back from the dead... I mean, previous Spidey enemies. These villains who all knew who Spidey was... except for Electro, who didn't know or had a hint at all of who Spidey was before he literally DIED, are back for revenge... even though Doc Ock redeemed himself before he died, Lizard saved Spider-man from death and delivered himself to the police, Sandman ended up getting forgiveness from his Spider-man and ended in good terms... The only guys that stayed evil until their deaths are The Green Goblin and Electro, so... I know of a solution, let's completely ignore their actual development and arcs and let's make them... go against Spider-man... for... reasons... Also, let's have them repeat phrases, no context, no meaning, just phrases from their movies...Now that we know that the plot makes no sense, the characters have no common sense, the villains are underwritten to now be hollow / lifeless versions of themselves in order to \"work\" in the movie's plot. We are going to receive empty references with no real emotional weight. Now and only now, we can clap, we can rejoice in the blessing that is to be a mindless audience with no standards and excitable at the presence of images we recognize.Also the other 2 Spider-men show up. Like in a cheap sitcom when a guest star comes into set, stands awkwardly and waits for the applause, then talks. It doesn't really matter what they say or how they say it. Remember we have no standards now. Anyway, they come, they go as far as putting on the suits and stand there... with the suits, clap you monkey. Cheer.They have a formulaic, tensionless, stake-less final fight and then they all go back to their worlds.This movie has the inclusion of 2 actual, real, good actors in Willem Dafoe and Andrew Garfield and they sure make the best they can with what they are given and make themselves the best part of the movie. At least on some level.It also has an actual good scene. When it is stripped of its context that is. I am talking of the final scene of the movie with a reckoned Peter starting a new life as Spider-man in the actual way he was meant to start his story from the very first appearance he made.So, in conclusion. This movie is not trash. This movie is just lazy. It had all the elements to be great, but it knew it was going to be successful with minimum effort, went for it and it was right. We clapped, we cheered and most importantly, we paid. We just encouraged laziness in our entertainment. We have showed that we have no standards. We just showed that we sell for cheap.", "Nostalgically Redeeming": "Not only does Spider-Man: No Way Home treats longtime fans with fun, quality and closure, but serves as a coming-of-age origin story for Peter Parker, turning the character from 'Spider-Boy' to 'Spider-Man' with a perfect balance of joyful and sad moments, all the while redeeming other significant characters.", "Spaider man": ".

Following on from the excellent Far From Home comes a film that dials back the comedy and ups the drama, and in that regards it feels somewhat like the older Spider-Man films. The action scenes are great... for the most part, although the final battle is a bit of a mess with quick cuts and A LOT happening. Alfred Molina is great as Doc Ock, but Willem Dafoe utterly steals the show reprising his Green Goblin role, and is even better here than he was in Spider-Man (2002). All in all its all very Marvel formula 101, with amazing effects, some in jokes and a very, very interesting mid-credits scene. If you like the other 2 films you'll enjoy this, but... its still not quite there. Somehow.", "The Ultimate Sacrifice": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is an absolute blast and a joy ride from beginning to end. I went into the cinema with moderate expectations and came out with my expectations exceeded. The film filled my heart with happiness and left me utterly speechless and in awe. It packs a punch and is action packed and exhilarating that will leave the viewer satisfied and euphoric.I grew up watching the Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield Spider-Man films and felt incredibly nostalgic when I saw all three Spider Men on-screen together. Each actor brings out a different spin on the character.The three Spidey heroes banding together to take down villains from the previous Spider-Man films was purely a joyous moment. The inclusion of previous Spider-Man villains from Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire's films is one of the many highlights of the film. Not only was it nostalgic seeing Green Goblin, Electro, Sandman, The Lizard and Dr. Octavius, but it was also great seeing all of them interact together.The film has a plethora of jaw dropping moments. One of those moments is when the Green Goblin blows up Happy Hogan's condo, knowing that Aunt May would get stuck in the crossfire. The scene itself was emotional and gut wrenching. Aunt May uttering the iconic line \"With great power comes great responsibility\" was perfectly timed and acted by Marissa Tomei. Aunt May served as a moral compass and a voice of reason to Tom Holland's Spider-Man, similarly to how Uncle Ben inspired both Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire's iteration of Peter Parker aka Spider-Man.Doctor Strange and Spider-Man's battle inside the mirror dimension was another visually stunning and mind-bending moment of the film. Peter using his geometry skills to trap Doctor Strange was pure genius. I love when Peter Parker uses his non-Spider-Man skills to the test.The moment where MJ is falling to her death and Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man saves her was a neat parallel to the Amazing Spider-Man 2. In that movie, Spider-Man tried to save Gwen unsuccessfully.The post credits scenes got me hyped and utterly flabbergasted and speechless. The mid-credit scene showcased Eddie Brock aka Venom in a bar in Tijuana, Mexico. Shortly before he gets transported back to his universe, Venom leaves a shred of his DNA. This begs the question who the host to the Venom of the MCU will be. The post credit scene, on the other hand, gave viewers a feast for the eyes. It served as a sneak peak to Doctor Strange: Into the Multiverse of Madness. Rachel McAdams is going to reprise her role, either in a dream sequence or from a different universe. Evil Doctor Strange's appearance right at the end made me think about the What If episode centering around Doctor Strange and his intent on saving his spouse. I reckon that Doctor Strange: Into the Multiverse of Madness is going to tie into the Disney plus series 'What If'.Charlie Cox made a cameo appearance as Matt Murdock aka Daredevil in this film. His appearance in this movie albeit brief caught me off-guard. I'm surprised that Charlie Cox's role in No Way Home wasn't leaked.Peter Parker made the ultimate sacrifice by the end of the film. He decided to let Dr. Strange complete the spell in which everyone forgets that he is Spider-Man. This was a rather sad and tear jerking ending to the Homecoming trilogy. At the same time, it is the perfect ending for Tom Holland's Peter Parker. He transformed from Spiderboy to Spider-Man. Aunt May's death helped Peter's transition to a more mature version of Spider-Man.To conclude, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fast paced and action-packed blockbuster filled with humour, heart, gravitas, and emotion. Tom Holland gave his best performance as Spider-Man yet. His acting range is none other than impressive. Seeing him interact with Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield is a dream come true. Not only is it my favourite Spider-Man film, it also is one of my all-time favourite films. No Way Home is the culmination of all three Spider-Man franchises and served as a celebration of the iconic hero.All live-action Spider-Man actors ranked:\n1. Andrew Garfield\n2. Tom Holland\n3.

Good setup for the future": "I think this movie was as good as it possibly could have been, considering what its makers were trying to do. Bringing back old villains, heroes, multiverse-style (very similar to Into the Multiverse), always feels at least a little jarring. If nothing else, navigating the different tones of past works while remaining true to the current universe presents a challenge. There were moments that just felt on the nose and silly to me. Also, the difference between the Spider-Man villains from older movies and the ones from Tom Holland's universe really shows. If nothing else, the idea that the villains could be \"fixed\" by reversing some mutation that they had experienced is counter-intuitive in the MCU, where both Vulture and Mysterio were just normal guys who relied on brains and technology.The internal conflict Peter feels just didn't come across to me. Why would Peter feel like he had some responsibility to help the villains? That has never been shown as a character trait of his before. Sure, he rescued Vulture from certain death, but he also let him face the full consequences of his actions. In the previous Holland Spider-Man films, the character arcs have been watertight in-universe, as far as I'm concerned, whether or not you believe they were consistent with Spider-Man as a previously existing character. I could easily believe in Homecoming's innocent, overzealous Peter, just as I could easily buy the Peter who was reluctant and scared after the events of Endgame in Far From Home. But Peter's desire to redeem the unfamiliar villains in No Way Home just felt like a non sequitur.That being said, of course, there was so much good in this movie. I loved the exploration of what would happen if Peter's identity became known, and the fact that Ned and MJ get to experience more of the Spider-Man action firsthand. I also like to see this Peter Parker facing more serious situations and having to deal with real conflict and grief. I am beyond curious how they will continue the story, and hope they take full advantage of Ned and MJ's interesting situation at the end of the movie. In general, of course, the MCU delivers - big spectacle, awkward jokes, and plenty of action. Not my favorite, but not the worst, by far.", "Not great.": "This was a perfectly entertaining film. Just to say I had expectations of something like endgame after I saw the advert. But the end was just so dull, just seems built to string out the spiderman arc of Tom Holland for a couple more movies. The idea of spiderman's secret identity seems a bit of a done idea in the MCU, where the all other super heroes are known to the public.As far as spiderman goes, the orginal spiderman 2 is still the best, and compared to the great set of new disney plus series, this dosn't seem to be a marvel highlight.", "a lot fof good scenes and nice time": "I am not fan spiderman.

Terrible. Marvel spent 2 hours showing off their \"superpower\", which is being rich and able to get all these people into this movie. But they absolutely didn't spend much time on writing a reasonable story!I guess the only thing that meant something to me is that Garfield Spider-Man got MJ, I know she's not Gwen, but...", "What No 70's Spider-man": "Genuinely my only complaint is and please take this as a \"spoiler warning\"is that there isn't at least an end credit scene that had Nicholas Hammond in asking if anyone needed a handapart from that as a 51 year old Yorkshireman, i couldn't find fault it was as damn close to perfectionnostalgic, fan serving, heart wrenching and great to see ALL the UK actors playing US superheroes & villain (that'll teach not to have an English Robin Hood Hollywood!!!!)Tom Holland possibly getting an oscar nod, his emotional scenes were excellent and the chemistry he has with Zendahay it's obvious they're a couple in real lifeall round great flick.", "9.5, The best Spider-man movie yet": "This movie is just encredibly good and is the best spider-man movie yet, all though i also really liked far from home, this one was just amazing. Its defenately worth-a-watch.", "Biggest boring utter Marvel garbage": "This movie is an utter garbage. Those saying this is a masterpiece have no idea about movie making. So booooooring. No screenplay, movie goes in whichever direction, full of cringey scenes.", "Best Spider-Man movie of all time!!!": "Overall the movie was great, really exceeded my expectations and worth the hype for it. I've never gotten this much goosebumps from a movie before, this movie tops endgame!", "It's ight... way overrated": "Feels like another MCU movie but this time with nostalgia grab added to it, it was entertaining and fun movie but come on now this being better than endgame and infinity ware gtfo here with nonsense, I honestly thing the one with Mysterio was far better than this one.", "A Classic": "Amazing film, loved it. A must see. Watching the three generations of Spider-Man get together was a delightful experience. Infinitely better than infinity war and endlessly superior to endgame.", "Must watch for Spiderman fans!": "This film is especially a must watch for those who have been watching Spiderman since the Tobey Maguire version from 2002 through Andrew Garfield version to Tom Holland version. The reason is well known and it's not even a spoiler any more--> all 3 Spidermans come together along with the villians from their time.This is by far the best Tom Holland Spiderman film considering this time he's not dependent on anyone for the fights and he takes matters in his hands. Absolute joy comes when villians from the previous universes start to come in and this joy can only be felt by the ones who have been watching all Spiderman films since 2002. Some scenes are very well executed like an emotional scene between Peter and Aunt May which is a turning point in the film which reminded me of a scene from Spiderman 2002 film.When it's a Tom Holland film, humor is a must and it works very well thanks to Ned and many more. From Ned calling Lizard as a \"Talking Dinasour\" to a scene where Tom Holland reveals that he worked as a team with Avengers and Tobey literally saying to this \"Wow that's great!! BTW what's Avenger?..a band?\" Lmao!! It's filled with such light hearted moments.Tom Holland finally owns the film unlike his previous ventures. Tobey and Andrew get only 35 mins but its enough for old viewers to get the nostalgia . Tobey's voice has certainly changed as he has grown old. Ned is terrific in his comic timing. Amongst the villians , Otto , electro and Goblin get the max screen space while lizard and sandman get the least . Goblin and Otto till date look and feel and act absolutely same as they were some 16-19 years ago.The climax is good if not the best you wished there was more brutal action like in Spiderman 3 (oh not to forget the final climax battle location looked a little similar to that of Spiderman 3 climax). The post climax scenes move really slowly things could have been ended 10 mins earlier.Overall, just don't miss this nostalgia ride.", "One of the best from Marvel": "I am what you would call a casual Marvel fan, I have seen almost all of their content (movies and TV series), and although generally speaking I enjoy their movies (with some exceptions) there's a very short list that I consider to be outstanding and this one goes right to the top.It's nearly impossible to make a heartfelt review without some spoilers, I grew up with Toby McGuire as Spider Man on the big screen and although those movies might seem outdated today they had a huge impact on younger generations and I even dare to say that they planted the seed for what Marvel would achieve years after..\nI enjoyed the other versions of Spider Man that made their way to the theaters, not all movies from the 3 iterations were great, but on average all of the generations had enjoyable moments and if you place them on the context of the year they launched they have their strengths, of course Tom Holland Spider Man, having a very close relationship with the Marvel Cinematic Universe gained a whole other dimension and made possible to create original and fun content.With that being said, I believe they made a fantastic job in the third installment of this third third generation of Spider Man, they leveraged the story line, that has been set up for the past year, the Multiverse, and made a movie that is not only funny, entertaining, nostalgic and most importantly brings a whole new dimension to the villains and treats them as humans.Seeing Tobey and Andrew in the same movie as Tom and participating in the insanity of the MCU, almost brought me to tears, nostalgic tears, and I think they made it work perfectly with the relationship between the 3 Spider Mans really hit the spot - and there were some really incredible moments.Also, bringing old villains and their respective actors William Dafoe and Alfred Molina, and explore the concept of forgiveness was simply fantastic, something Marvel usually wouldn't do, as they stick to their black and white world, but now they are evolving as audiences evolve as well, and this shows they are on the right track.It was an amazing experience, you will laugh, tear up, gasp and be surprised by some dark twists - probably the best Spider Man to this day and one of the best Marvel movies thus far.", "Tom Holland .... 12 out of 10": "I was never a fan of Spider-man in the comics, nor any of the Sony licensed films. But, since 2016, I've been \"all in\" for Tom Holland. #StruggleNation @DayOneWeThere All the principles from the MCU continue to be fantastic, and the fact that Marvel can now establish \"our\" universe as \"theeee\" universe, and update/correct anything that fans didn't care for from the original films and cast, .... I mean, this film raises the bar above and beyond where Endgame raised it. 2008 to 2019 is officially laid to bet, and 2021 onward is the new stage for the new next Next NEXT LEVEL. Dr. Strange 2022 is going to be epic. But THIS FILM IS A MUST SEE for All Movie Goers. This film needs EVERY AWARD INCLUDING BEST PICTURE. Seriously, every human who watches films needs to watch this film. 10 out of 10.... actually 12 out of 10.", "Enjoyed it until the end": "It was great seeing the characters from the previous spiderman movies showing up, as well as the other spidermans (spidermen?). The action was solid and the movie had a lot going for it. One problem was the length of the movie and how drawn out and sappy the final scenes ended up being. As a comic fan, I appreciate harkening back to Spiderman being a teenager, but the teen agnst was ratcheted up a little too high for me.I'd also say Dr Strange has gone downhill from his initial appearance in the MCU. His scenes were rushed and concentrated more on CGI than his acting chops.Overall, it was a fun movie, just not great.", "Blessed to watch this movie": "So blessed to see this movie on big screen the crowd the literally mad the whole time i just could not deliver my experience it was mesmerizing just perfect movie at the years end...", "Best film ever": "Best film because andrew garfield is hot and in it! Andrew Garfield is the best, hot, iconic, funny, downright amazing. Tobey was good too i guess BUT ANDREW AH YES! Tom did good too! But andrew is better! Dont judge me!", "The hall was on fire! It was an emotional journey.": "The greatest factor of the movie is how they literally control your emotions. People watching spiderman since the Tobey Maguire trilogy will experience an emotional experience like never before. Simply put the storytelling is a work of genius. Including Tobey and Andrew into this movie clearly put a great impression on every body during the movie, the hall was on fire. Final scenes of the movie, during the part where peter met MJ for the first time after doctor strange done the spell got everyone including me into tears. So for all the spiderman fans out there, be ready for one of the greatest 2 hours you will spend in a superhero movie.Furthermore, the VFX, specially during the doctor strange and Peter Parker fight was completely insane.Finally, I would say that this is the best Marvel movie ever, and it might fight the Dark Knight (not really surpassing it) as the greatest superhero movie of all time!", "Revered Today, Forgotten Tomorrow": "The latest installment in the MCU brings back beloved characters to strip them of who they are and shove them into the Marvel machine. It's hard to feel anything for a movie that refuses to acknowledge it's characters as anything other than fan service and plot devices. The movie starts off with the laziest excuse to introduce the multiverse, as if talking while Strange is casting a spell can suddenly open up the multiverse and specifically make certain characters appear. Strange is made to look like an idiot whether it was for is failed spell, or his inability to stop a man doing spider tricks, even his exit sticks out like a sore thumb. The only purpose Electro, Sandman, and the Lizard served were to be the bad guys, when they were so much more. Blindly all 3 of them suddenly agree to following Green Goblin, knowing that he's being controlled, and refuse to take the cure; why? The movie doesn't have an answer so you shouldn't ask. The 3 Spider-Men could have has some great banter, however their screen time went in jokes that didn't land. And they remained unutilized till the end of the movie.\"With great power, comes great responsibility.\" Words that meant so much throughout the Raimi trilogy, and guided Toby's spiderman as a moral compass. Those words were shoved in here as a soulless headliner that tantamounts to nothing, and could not be described as anything but forced. Aunt May's death serves no purpose other than to be a plot device for Tom Holland's Spider-Man to stop being an idiot and take things seriously. One could argue that Tom's Spider-Man is just a teenager and he doesn't know how to handle things, but speaking realistically he might as well be a God. Prior to this movie, not a single mistake of his has been punished; and so we don't get to see and empathize with a character struggling to be a teen and a savior, but distantly applaud someone who no one could ever relate to. This Spider-Man is just to Spider, because there's no humanity in him. In 50 years the Raimi trilogy will remain just as powerful as it was yesterday, but the MCU trilogy will be forgotten, as there is nothing that makes him special, anf nothing that makes him like us; with this movie sealing it's coffin as nothing more than nostalgia grab, and just another movie in the MCU.", "A waste of my time": "Long and boring. Stupid dialogs wanting to be witty. A waste of my time. 2h 28m could had been packed in maybe 1h 28m to get a decent movie. Yes decent not good.", "Go all in for the movie....": "Yes multiverse is real . And this movie not just connects multiverse it connects old and upcoming movies in Marvel universe...\nEmotional, funny and exciting...just three words to express the movie.", "An Absolute Masterpiece!": "Yep... They went all out on this edition. This movie is an absolute masterpiece. Everything has been well thought out and was quadruple checked, this edition is by far the best in the history of the franchise. Kudos to the entire team!", "1000000/10": "Best Marvel movie ever!From the first scene to the last scene I was exited.But when I saw Andrew and Tobey... I can't say what I was feeling. I just had to cry. From happiness.The scene wen MJ didn't remember Peter. I was heart broken.I hope in the next movies that MJ & Ned that they can remember spiderman but especially PETER PARKER.", "Too Many Long and Drawn Out Emotional Scenes": "This movie is star-studded with really awesome action scenes with added humorous one-liners to keep you engaged. But OMG, I was starting to look at my phone to check my emails, checking facebook etc., when all the long, sad, emotional, boring, drawn out scenes started appearing about two-thirds through the movie. That's why it was two and half hours long, half an hour of \"crying\". C'mon Marvel, way to lose loyal fans. Get back to keeping it pure. We just want action, great CGI, big name stars, and funny one-liners. Well I do anyway.", "The best movie in cinematic history": "It was perfect! Tom, Jacob, and Zendaya are amazing the storyline is amazing I don't know how to explain it with out spoiling it because each part of this movie is important and it's best to watch it knowing NOTHING. I wish I could just say everything but it's was 100% worth the wait!", "Dream": "This movie was a dream come true!!!The amount of nostalgia it gave is immeasurable!! It wasnt just illogical fan-service!! It dealt with a complex concept, the multiverse, which directly ties in with the rest of the mcu events for phase 4!!! The ending is extremely heavy and emotional and probably the most perfect way to end a film like this. The writing is extremely beahtiful..The pace is perfect! The action is high-octane!!!Best movie I've seen so far!", "my girlfriend loved it...what more to say": "The move is ok, and entertaining. Has a lot of emotional nostalgic moments, but its also a bit slow and boring here and there. Worth watching of course, but just bringing things back without adding something new is not enough for me. Its another post endgame movie that suffers from the post thanos syndrome.", "Spiderman blinded them with science!": "Well, what can you say. People love this movie for the nostalgia factor, but take that away and you have a plodding non-storyline punctuated by moments of jaw-dropping silliness. The first twenty minutes or so are possibly the best; the film plays out as a goofy Spider-Man-centric black comedy with Jon Watts' directing slavishly imitating the directing style of Sam Raimi. (Lots of zooms, etc). Cartoonish CGI is mostly absent, as the plot focuses on the fallout of Peter Parker's secret identity being revealed.Sigh. Then Dr. Strange comes in. Honestly, every time Dr Strange shows up uncalled for in a Marvel movie he just destroys any claim to individuality the movie has and morphs it into corporate sludge. Then there is a quasi-farcical scene involving a 'spell' that Strange will cast to make everyone forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man- -a scene which mostly succeeds in making the characters look about as competent as Beavis and Butthead.At this point everything just becomes arbitrary and nonsensical as random villains from other movies pop up and Spider-Man tries to capture them like Pok\u00e9mon Go LARP edition. Two of the villains (played by Alfred Molina and Daniel Defoe) have better performances than any Marvel movie deserves, but the others just come across as absurdly goofy. (One is a giant lizard that wants to turn everyone into lizards as well).Then Spider-Man decides to 'fix' the villains by turning them 'good'. It sounds like a tall order, but recruited by two other Peter Parkers, there is no limit to what his science can achieve. Because of course immorality can be eradicated by injecting people with iridescent vaccines.Well, at least the scenes of these three Peter Parkers in lab coats creating magical elixirs has some kind of understated humor to it. And of course, it's nice seeing Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield back.", "Emotionnaly confusing... ?": "The movie was honestly very entertaining in vast majority. Good action scenes, impeccable CGI, a bunch of attaching characters, an interesting mutliverse story...I've read someone write that movies were made to make you \"feel\" things, and this one did, indeed. But maybe a little too much, ultimately! Or not with a proper conclusion, or at least not satisfying to me...\nBut at the same time, are movies supposed to give the audience what it wants? No, by all means no!To go into specifics, Aunt May's death came as a freaking surpise, but it served the movie well, I guess. At least, it's a powerful engine in the original Spider-Man story, so why not... Point is, it could be seen as very lazy writing. They \"just\" took the previous older Spider-Man movies and rehashed 3 arcs into one... Honestly, it was still very well done. There are brillant humoristic moments, I really cracked a few times. The casting is super neat. Well, it wasnt hard, when bringing back all the main characters from the previous movies, with the good and attaching actors who played them.But to be completely fair... I boo'ed the ending. Multiple times... Even if I was home alone!! I found it so infuriating, sad, despairing even!!! It felt like such a let-down.Adding 3 post-ending/credit sequences didnt change that much. It felt also really weird that there was kind of a complete Dr Strange trailer at the very end, instead of a more classic short teaser. I'l definitely watch it, though :)", "The best Spider-Man film ever made!": "And I do not say that lightly. This is by far the best Spider-Man film ever made (yes, even better than spiderverse) just go and watch it if you haven't already.", "THIS IS SPIDER-MAN!": "Finally, the MCU manages to truly capture the essence or Spider-Man. They manage to truly express his motives and moral compass in a way that does justice to the source character!Without giving away any spoilers, I will just say that this movie is daring, emotional and filled to the brim with a rich story complex characters.I can safely say that No Way Home manages to do a better job fleshing out 5 villains than most Marvel movies do with just 1 villain.This movie makes so much sense and perfectly bookends a trilogy that turns out to merely be an origin story. I happily welcome Tom Holland's Spider-Man and I love the character that has come from these origin movies. I look forward to seeing what the truest depiction of Spider-Man has to offer as he continues his adventures in the MCU.", "Great nostalgia but mixed with a predictable and loose plot": "I grew up watching Spiderman and the nostalgia of seeing Maguire was great, but that doesn't off set the weak and predictable plot mixed with some very unclear motives from all the old foes.Caught this film last night after seeing it constantly talked about on social media. I have not enjoyed any recent marvel films including the 2 previous spider-mans, and although I must say this was better, it still left much to be desired.The first hour or so was pretty painful and dull, but it did pick up towards the end. I like a long film, but for an action film like this, it felt like it dragged on.The acting was pretty poor on the whole bar Willem Dafoe who defines what it means to be a super hero villain. Yet the majority played cheesy roles with no substance.Did they try to cram too many villains in? Absolutely. Focusing on the Green Goblin was good, but the lizard guy and sandman was pretty unnecessary. Bar the obvious nostalgia.I am older and I get the film is geared towards a younger audience who for clear reasons would want to see the CGI and extravagant scenes.Is it too much to ask for a clearly defined, intricate plot these days?Anyway, it's always fun to get to the movies and i enjoyed parts for sure.", "It's a Fun Movie": "Let me start off my saying I'm not one of those people who go crazy over Marvel movies... (Shrugs) They're alright. Some of them are better then others but I most certainly wouldn't put ANY Marvel in my top ten movies of all time. And any person who can look me straight in the eyes and say that they truly honestly believe Spider Man: No Way Home is the best movie ever made-they can't think of any other movie they've ever seen that was better-well, I might question whether they were mentally handicap. For real.So I saw this movie about two months ago. A sign that a movie was good to you would be remembering a lot about it. I don't remember that much about this movie but I'll dip my toe into some of the stuff I do remember.You ever watch a TV show or movie where some character makes a garbage-ass joke and all the characters fake laugh at it? Like, the people playing that part don't really think that's funny so they're forcing a laugh. That fake laugh BS. I always roll my eyes when that happens. Peter Parker asks Doc Oct what his name is. He tells them it's Otto Octavius and Peter and the Gang get a good little laugh out of that. OH MY GOD IT'S SO FUNNY! But then they ask him what his real name is and he tells them the same thing... I work in law and I've seen some crazy-ass names. Names that your tongue would get tied in a knot trying to say. I met two guys with the last name Weiner and Doodee. Yup, true story. Mr. Weiner and Mr. Doodee, but not at the same time. I don't think Otto Octavius is that funny of a name and I don't remember anybody I was watching it with laughing either. But they're going laugh at it because that name is so crazy! ... Ok. Peter should've just said, \"Are you for real?\" And Doc Oct says, \"Yeah.\" And that's that. No need to fake laugh at it. I remember that part and it bothered me.Another thing I had an issue with was whether what Peter Parker was doing, trying to save these villains, while good and admirable was, to me, morally ambiguous. My understanding is that he had to cure them and send them all back to their respective dimensions. This would fix things and all would go back on to the way it was, for some reason, and no one has to die. Right? Now I can see the Sandman, and the Lizard Dude, and Otto Octavius, and Green Goblin wanting to be cure. Some of there conditions may not have been entirely their fault. Some of them could be consider victims. But it's hard for me to believe that Electro would want to go back to the way he was. Why? He was a loser. No one even knew his damn name! Would you really want to go from being an electrical god to being a nobody? But Peter is forcing the cure on them. The alternative is to die but their not given that choice. Is it right to force a cure on someone who doesn't want to be cured? What if they like who they are? What if they'd prefer to die instead? They're not given any other options. Peter Parker is so good that he's going to cure them whether they like it or not. The moral implications of him forcing them to be saved is complicated when you really start to think about it.The last thing I remember is the Three Parkers. That was a cool scene and this is what brought my score up to a seven. I was especially impressed with Tobey Maguire back as the original Spider Man. He's older, wiser, and seems to genuinely care. And there's a sadness behind his eyes. I would be really interested in watching another spider man movie with him reprising the role.", "The best movie I have training ever watched!": "I have not been following spider-man before and it were still easy to understand. When I got home the first thing I did when I got home was to watch every Spiderman movie!", "A mega multiverse BS!": "Whoever writes these stories forget a common sense thing. The technology they show used by the main characters are so advanced ! But many associates of those people still die in lame ways! Horrible logic. It's like Elon musk while riding a self driving Tesla and his mom driving a 1990 Tercel and get into accident and die!If Hollywood is so advanced why is Toby McGuire look like he is 50? The creation of multiverse is OK but the way they brought in those characters is flawed. Multiverse can have better stories. Actually Tom Holland could have travelled to the other universes and helped the other spider men in a meaningful way to defeat those enemies.I wish they write those kind of comics in which someone from the future helps the protagonist and the future version is revealed in separate stories later on after a few years! Might be interesting!This new story here is not about multiverse logic but about satisfying nostalgic fan boys! That way they succeeded!", "Had Endgame feels": "Really enjoyed this film , had some Endgame type feels , PP is really just a lost soul searching for his place & the whole premise ... just works! Loved loved loved all of the cameos!Another success!", "This is a masterpiece": "This movie has a really amazing arc of Tom's pete, amazing acting and a good dynamic between character and a good story. This movie made me really like Andrew's pete/ spidey. And even tobey, especially Tom with his arc.This is my favourite spiderman film and you can't convince me other wise.SPOILER ALERT: Venom was returned to his universe but a part of venom stayed.", "nicer than i expected": "I liked the movie very much, of course, there were shortcomings, all the bad characters came back, for example, there was no venom, she may have kept it for the sequel, apart from that, 3 peter parker was very good\nI'm curious about the sequel, what will happen, there may be a different sequel, a few more of the marvel characters may come, other than that, nice movie congratulations.", "ridiculous plot, tryhard clumsy comical, flat out boring": "The plot is just so dumb that is painful and hard to ignore. Best case, it fits to a slapstick comedy and thats the genre i would put it into. So forget any tension, any thrill or interest that the story could create.Then it full of childish moral which just makes you cringe. Certainly a comic adventure should have some comedy in it, but again here they try so hard and so often to be funny, but it just isn't. The CGI is 1A, but how many stars can you get for a cgi masterclass (3 in my case and all three are for the CGI otherwise it would zero).A good movie maybe for children. That was it for me, I will not watch any more comic movies. No idea how it go 72 on metascore which in the past was always a guideline for me that worked.", "In what multiverse is this a 9??": "First off I have to say I loved the idea for this movie, and it's the best trilogy ending fans could have asked for.Now for my dislikes - Tom Holland is very likeable, but this is undoubtedly the least clever Spiderman I've seen. I know he's only a teenager, and they tend to do stupid things, but he's suppose to be a genius. In all of the trilogy I've yet to see him make a right decision, and overall his ability to analyze situations is not that of a genius, and it just makes him a very unbelievable character.My second issue is that there are too many plot holes. Like I said this Movie has an amazing idea but it looks like the makers had a checklist they wanted to cover and they were willing to bend the plot in any way to accomplish that. It's very similar in that way to Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Ring.Marvel's last movies where not up to the standard we were accustomed to, I was sure by the high review score that this was their return to glory, unfortunately that's not the case.Final verdict:\n5/10 - skip this movie or watch it from home with the remote near by.", "First inning was very good but at last there is over bad acting of Bollywood": "First inning was very good but at last there is over acting of Bollywood girl. Giving the role of Oracle to bollywood actress is complete nonsense ..................................", "Spider-man in our heart": "Best best best best best best best movie in the world whatever we want we got from Sony and marvel this movie stole my heart and every character is doing awesome in no way home and love the both post credit scenes.", "Disregard any review with a rating under 9": "Anyone who thinks this movie doesn't deserve a 9 or higher did not watch the movie and/or they're a troll. Go see the movie, it is simply amazing and gives End Game and Infinity War a run for its money.", "Couldn't been So, So much better - Wasted potential-": "It was hard to see pass some of the acting, the lines and the script of the \"teenDults\" actors.... I love Marvel movies but I almost walked out of this one, it got better at the end. It made me feel like I was watching a Hanna Montana movie, not a Marvel movie. I think it ha the potential to be as good as the first Dr. Stranger Movie or the first Iron Man, but the teenActitude for the first 70% of the movie was unbearable.", "Hard to watch. It genuinely hurt to sit through this.": "Firstly I want to point out that I am a lifelong Spider-Man fan. I always have been and I firmly believe I will be for all my life. Though you could call me a \"boomer\" if you will, since I've only totally enjoyed the Raimi trilogy. Amazing Spider-Man 1 was decent, though it did have some errors. ASM2 plain sucked, and while MCU Spidey had a rocky start with the average at best Homecoming, things only got worse with the awful follow-up Far From Home, and now this...this odious, horrible mess that I actually found myself pausing to recover from sheer spiritual pain at least twice.Before I dive into the faults, I want to at least discuss the positives, because as with any other Spider-Man film there is always *something* to like. First off, the acting was spectacular. Every single actor - and I mean EVERY single actor - turns in masterful performances, giving it their all in every scene. Tom Holland continues to take these bad scripts and spin them into almost golden material as does his supporting cast, Cumberbatch delivers his best here just as he did in his debut film and the Avengers flicks, and the older actors such as Dafoe, Molina, and the long-anticipated Maguire and Garfield have never been better with their own showings. Even when they have very little to work with, even others such as Charlie Cox, and Tom Hardy - in both of his roles - absolutely conquer their roles as always.The effects are mostly kind of poor. So much CGI is used all over the place, with standout shots being the Mirror Dimension and the fight scenes, especially the apartment one where Goblin destroys everything (best part by the way). But there are also really poorly done CG animations and composite shots (Tobey and Andrew's intros are both very bad with these). With how hit-and-miss it's all done, there isn't much else to talk about that probably hasn't already been said.The music, when it isn't constantly using the MCU Spider-Man theme over and over (and trust me, they use it way too much) is also much of the same save for a few standouts; the apartment fight scene, the previous Spider-Men's themes play for a short period of time in the climax, and the Green Goblin and Doc Ock are introduced with their themes from Spider-Man 1 and 2, which I will concede is a great touch.On the subject of villains, I also love Electro's new costume, what with the reference to the famous starface mask. The fact that the big three villains; Goblin, Ock and Venom; all made it into one film is awesome, and of course, the fact you finally see the three Spideys together is still hard to believe, and their chemistry is excellently done.Now with all that said; it's time to get angry.The writing was never really the MCU's strongest suit in the first place, especially once Phase 2 started rolling out, but this is honestly some of the worst I've seen. First off, the multiverse thing didn't even have to happen. They honestly could've just made a third MCU Spider-Man film, leave the old stuff alone and come up with their own version of these villains, and it would've come out a bit better. However, as is, this arguably damages the continuity of all three film serieses because these villains are all here in the MCU, and fall victim to one of the worst plot points I've ever heard; the entire \"cure\" thing.Allow me to stress everything wrong with this \"save the villains\" thing; first, if these villains somehow are not the originals and are instead some alternate timeline branch thing that Endgame established, then their presence holds no weight because they're not *THE* same villains. Which I guess was destined to happen considering they never brought back the older writing teams. Secondly, at no point do you see them actually return home and face their fates; they're destined to be hated, outcasted and have lost what they love, and apparently Peter sees that to be better than death? And because you never see them return home at all, they honestly could have outright died at the end from Strange's convenient magic neuralyzer - after all, they were in the MCU *because* of the erased information. Third - I do not know any other Spider-Man who would *ever* be stupid enough to just allow five psychopathic villains into his property and expect them to trust him and not screw anything up. Ever. That is so thoroughly stupid that even Green Goblin taunts him on it; and he is supposed to be wrong. Even ASM1 Spider-Man - the one who labeled his camera with his real name - even he did not bother just inviting his villains into a condominium to have a cold one together.Back to writing, it carries over several of the same issues that FFH had, such as Peter's bad priorities (MIT > the entire universe apparently), the immediate undoing of an interesting plot thread (Aunt May is just perfectly A-OK with Peter's identity when the exact opposite was implied in Homecoming; and FFH's entire post credits scene is completely undone in about 20 minutes), among more, smaller issues. The ending was honestly a massive overcompensation, as if they saw MCU Spidey's criticisms and basically just flipped everybody off by not only completely ripping off of Spider-Man PS4 (which, while flawed, is much better written than this), but also by going much too far in the wrong direction. Spider-Man needs a supporting cast to keep him grounded in reality; and while Ned and Michelle were not my ideal thoughts for supporting characters, they still did their roles well. You cannot have Spider-Man *entirely* by himself and expect it to work; his friends, enemies and family and how he is tied to them is one reason why he's so fascinating. Speaking of enemies, remember Homecoming's post-credits scene? Yep, that's all irrelevant now. I may have not liked Homecoming nor Far From Home, but neither film deliberately went out of their way to actively destroy other film canons that they had no business with the first place.I could honestly go on about the insane amount of problems with the writing I have; Norman and Otto just knowing each other and therefore invalidating Harry's entire story arc, Harry's death being played off as a joke, Electro not even knowing Spider-Man's identity and yet just being there anyway, Venom not even HAVING Spider-Man in his filmverse and yet ALSO being there anyway, the weird absence of the Raimi Mary Jane despite her knowing his identity, just SO. MUCH. WRONG!The pacing is beyond awful because there are multiple scenes that just keep dragging on and on with no end, and many of them with no point. This is only a two and a half hour long film, and it felt longer than Endgame because it just would not even progress sometimes.The characters, at first, just seem like the typical for the MCU Spider-Man films; Peter is a naive idiot and everyone else is either there for a joke or is really bland and unfunny. Dr. Strange's character is horribly botched in this, best shown during his and Peter's blatant miscommunication regarding the spell in the first place. When it comes to the older villains, they seem painfully simplified. This could be the case because of different writers in charge, but some things are near completely wrong. Just to mention one; it is only mentioned that Norman Osborn is a corrupt and greedy man, yet it never shows here; Spider-Man 1 displays his more ambiguous morality much better.As a few extra points, even one of the costumes kind of suck; specifically Green Goblin's second outfit. I just think it would look better with a new mask like that animatronic one plus new purple gloves, then we'd be golden. Venom got to do...well, nothing whatsoever, so his presence was to only set up some symbiote...thing that might as well take 8 more years to pay off. One more thing as well; I like how the MCU swore up and down that they wouldn't retread the whole responsibility thing...yet here they are, doing it with Aunt May dying, which means this Spidey apparently learned the lesson about power and responsibility...and then forgot it, so he had to learn it *twice*!What else can I say except that this film was a trainwreck, and I'm a Spider-Man 3 defender. I was able to endure that with no issues at all; and yet I couldn't even finish this without cringing hard. But, as much as I'm eager to say that this is the worst Spider-Man film I've ever seen, I can't say I regret watching it, nor not understand why it didn't work for me. This was trying to please everyone in all angles and sides, which is a very lofty height to achieve. Plus, I guess I can also say that, for better or worse, everybody got involved in this somehow. Even Sony's oddball Venomverse got into the mix at the end, and in that degree I can say that this is less a film and more a celebration of all things Spider-Man in film. And honestly, in the midst of the abysmal writing that literally cancels out the film's positives and drops said film to the lowest score I can, I can respect them for the heart put into it and I can leave feeling happy I saw it. But also so angry at the same time.Even though I hated this, I can still recommend it as I am in the minority. It's worth seeing once for the spectacle and maybe you'll find something in it I haven't. But for me, one viewing is enough to tell me the MCU is past its prime, and I can't afford to waste any more of my spare time on it.Rating - 1/10 (retcon laden writing completely kills all three Spider-Man film continuities, brutally ruining much if not most of the positives, fanservice and a lot of the enjoyment value in the film; the acting, effects, and so on may be spectacular, but it's all made even more tragic that their efforts were all wasted on this horrible screenplay, and the entire \"save the villains\" plot point is literally unforgivable and is bordering on fanfiction)", "Just my reviews": "Excellent movie one of all time favourite Marvel movies. Three Spiderman scenes are epic to the core worth the money watch it IMAX to get immersive experience.", "The worst MCU movie ever": "Lazy writing : the movie buries Doctor Strange's whole arc for the plot(the reason he lost to Peter in mirror world is math and ned making ring portals few minutes after wearing the ring are just the few). The scenes with Andrew and Toby could have been good but the dialogues felt forced.", "Amazing Experience!": "From start of the movie till end, what a ride it has been. It had it all, humor, action, great acting and unbelievable cinematography! I'm already hyped up for upcoming big marvel projects...", "Film is dead and you're all out of your mind": "This movie is typical of what Marvel has offered us time and time again: mindless entertainment. There is nothing, absolutely nothing that separates this installment from the previous ones. Jokes are as lame as before, characters as shallow as they have ever been and good writing as inexistent as it can possibly be in a 200 million dollar production.This is \"film\" at its worse. This movie and the ones before it are nothing more than magnified Transformers or other Michael Bay flicks. The fact it has almost a 9.0 rating on IMDB is a joke and shows that either the public is stupid or Disney has made it so numb, it cannot even recognize a bad movie when it sees one.Moreover, I am not one to usually point out inconsistencies in movies but the plot of this thing just makes no sense at all whatsoever. (Spoiler: How the hell erasing Tom Holland's Spiderman from people's memories will restore the multiverse barrier?!).Final point, as much as I personally dislike the previous iterations of Spiderman for several reasons, this movie did something absolutely incredible which raises its mediocrity to a whole new level. Let me explain, the biggest issue of the MCU has always been the lack of interesting antagonists. In this one however they brought back classic villains from Sam Raimi's movies: The Green Goblin, Dr Octopus and others, so you may think they'd get this right for once. They did not.Each of those characters gets the MCU treatment, totally washed down. They become bland, predictable and just outright uninteresting. I just think it's incredible to make a movie with around 15 characters and to manage to make me care for literally none of them. I guess you can call this an achievement.Overall, let's just say that Martin Scorsese was wrong. Those are not theme parks. Not anymore, cause theme parks are at least fun. This, however, was just tedious if not painful.", "Spider Man 8": "Combines the best parts of every Spider-man to make one of the best cinematic experiences of all time. Tom Holland gives the best performance by any Spidey ever in an film. It celebrates Spider Man like never before. All the performances are really damn good.

The multiverse saga is believable and fantastic special effects. Tom Holland finally feels likes Spiderman. But they really do need to lose this director (Jon Watts) for the next round of films.

Greatest spiderman film hands down.", "Chapeau bas MARVEL!": "Well, the movie didn't disappointed us, but i thought that it is strongly depended with LOKi in multiverse thing, but fine still perfect, and i wish that the ending scene lead us to a venom in the MCU \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udcaa", "Very childish, but could be fun": "To be honest, it's more of a disappointment. The film itself is almost for kids - jokes, funny character, the base of a plot is a joke. Not to mention this version of Spider-Man is quite dull - Tom is a nice guy, but I used to know Spider-Man as a very smart lad. But doctor Strange is like he was replaced for this film - his actions are irresponsible and stupid.On the contrary, it's still can be fun, even though marvel repeats itself all the time. Seeing familiar faces and hearing familiar phrases did touch a free strings. Also the ending creates hope that we will meet the Spider-Man we deserve in the next series.", "At the same level than Avengers infinite war and endgame": "This is the culmination of 30 years of spiderman movies, that means that Raimi and web saga is canon.The story explores the maturation of parker (holland) and his stand alone in the MCU after her aunt died, the Mystery is about his uncle Ben.The post credits scenes show the posible simbyote saga in the new trilogy.And the multiverse continues with doctor supreme (what if) in march.", "Grear movie!": "With a great expectation there must come great responsibility to make movie live up to it!

Extremely impressive how they were able to balance all the plot threads and story arcs. Perfect combination of fan service and nostalgia along with authentic character growth and an amazing storyline. Even with so many returning characters, the biggest stand out of the film is Tom Holland. His performance is so dynamic and riveting, definitely the best thing about this movie.", "A Masterpiece": "This movie for me was pure with high expectations and it successfully nailed it. I have to say that this is one of the greatest Spider-Man movies of all time. It has its highs and lows following this character and what he wanted to do best. This is why I love Tom and how he portrayed the character. He wanted to\ndo what was right to help the villains to become\ngood but in the end it didn't work for all of them. He has lost more then what we could imagine and that's insane to me. I thought the other two Spider-Mans had worst causes but adding them both still doesn't match Tom holland situation. This was a fantastic\nmovie, and it really suck that everyone who knew Spider-Man will forget about him and even saving the universe. This is what I find extraordinary about movies like this. There is sometimes never gonna be happy endings and understanding the risk of a hero and them having to lose to save everyone else is just\ntouching.", "Spider-Man: No Way Home was a greatly balanced fan service.": "The movie did some homage to previous ones using one liners, costumes and concepts but didn't shove it on audience's face, keeping it a movie about Tom Holland's Spider-Man.One of drags was main fight of the movie was shot in night of course to keep the finances low and waste less effort on these scenes. Apart from that, movie explored the multi-verse pretty good I believe but also understand those who oppose.Villains' motives were much more understandable in this movie than their own respective titles. Also, Parker's turn on Strange was explored pleasingly. I also enjoyed J. Jonah's modern media personality and found it very fitting.Directing was much better than most superhero movies.Marketing for this movie was quite interesting. Company kept Garfield and Maguire's involvement as a secret well, excluding them from the press release for the sake of it, though each poster for the movie made me laugh out loud. They were \"Graphic design is my passion.\" level designs looking like they were made on MS Paint.", "Evaluation of the film and a prediction for what it can set up in the future trilogy": "Bad things: Mirror Dimension train scene background didnt blend. First hour or so was a bit rushed. Dialogue was kinda cheesy. Some parts were predictable. Matt Murdock didn't really help. Should've had Peter do some normal crime fighting like burglers at the start of end like every other iteration because he didn't do it in the other two. Electro was still bad. Doc Ock at the start was sick in the fight but his dialogue was a bit iffy at the start. Tom still needs another movie or two to show he can actually do it on his ownGood things: If you've seen What If...? Then it's gonna be sick because you see Supreme Strange at the end of it. The movie will be insane and the cracks in the sky around the end resembles cracks in the sky like Loki so he could get involved somehow like Wanda is. Shows Eddie go back to his universe, but leaves some symbiote behind. Which means he's gonna get symbiote suit next trilogy. I think for Spider-Man 4 Peter gets symbiote. Loses it later and Mac Gargan gets it and become Venom like in the comics, and he was crazyy. Then he gets beaten and the symbiote piece is either given to Eddie or destroyed. Then in Spider-Man 6 its a sinister 6 film, Mac Gargan becomes Scorpion and the team is Scorpion, Shocker, Vulture, Rhino, Mysterio return maybe and idk maybe his own Norman Osborn. And for Spider-Man 5 they should make Ned Hobgoblin. I doubt they'll crossover with Eddie now though it could still happen. Flash's book is named after a DC event. The graffiti says Ditko who is the main creator of Spider-Man. Green Goblin says \"I'm something of a scientist myself\" again. Andrew and Tobey, kinda recreated the chameleon meme from 60s. There appearance was predictable and hinted though. Andrew saved MJ, predictable and he got redemption. Daredevil finally in the MCU now but he didn't really do much in this film BUT it could set up Kingpin or the Back in Black comic because of the symbiote. Tobey could actually act in this film and they showed his Peter's intelligence properly. Aunt May's death gives development for Tom cah he didn't get \"With great power comes great responsibility\" from Ben. They kinda set up Hobgoblin, Ned's goblin from the comics because of mentioning Harry's death and being a villain, and then telling Peter it won't happen, but he doesn't know him now so it's gonna change. Electro references Miles because he thinks there's a black Spider-Man who will probably come later, especially cah May volunteered for F. E. A. S. T. Rhino might come because Andrew mentions that. Peter doesn't have Ned as his best friend now and might become friends with Harry which could eventually set up MCU's oscorp and Green Goblin. New ending suit looks more comic accurate but i couldn't see the logo so it might be bad.Predictions for next trilogy: They could start their own Oscorp and Norman Osborn which makes Peter wary and become friends with Harry for that specific reason but ends up becoming best friends with him. Spider-Man 4 can start off with Scorpion and because Peter will probably get the symbiote he can go rage mode and get Ned angry right after becoming friends again which causes him to be Hobgoblin like seeing how Harry and Peter are proper good friends and after Peter gets rid of the symbiote it can go to Mac Gargan (Scorpion) like in the comics or they can have Kraven for the villain instead and do Kraven's Last Hunt. Or they save Mac Gargan Venom for Spider-Man 5 or Hobgoblin for Spider-Man 5 by setting it up in Spider-Man 4 and starting the film off with Rhino and setting up Miles in Spider-Man 5 too and having him bit in the end credits. Depending on the next 2 films, I think they should put sinister six for Spider-Man 6 and have Miles start becoming Spider-Man too to set up his films later. But for the S6 they should use Rhino, Scorpion, Vulture, Hobgoblin or Tom's own Green Goblin, maybe Kraven and for the 6th member either the return of Mysterio, use Prowler (Miles's uncle), Chameleon, Wilson Fisk (Kingpin) or Martin Li (Mister Negative).", "Movie of the year!!!": "This is not only the best Spider-Man movie of all time it could be the best movie of all time.

Movies as we know them have moved into a whole new multiverse!!!!!!This could quite be one of the finest story adventures yet in the realm of movie entertainment!!", "Spiderman's Homecoming trilogy comes to a satisfying, lip-smacking end! It is Endgame level brilliant!!!": "Well, that was a long wait and finally here we are! The release of what is now become a Marvel movie that is at par with Avengers: Endgame given the scale, the characters and emotions. No Way Home is the third movie in the MCU Spider-Man trilogy and it is the best one yet (across all spidey movies ever).No Way Home picks up where we left off in Far From Home with Mysterio revealing the man behind the mask. Parker & his friends are forced to clear their name but there are repercussions. Wishing to lead a normal life, he approaches Dr. Strange for help that results in fracturing the multiverse & sending people who know Peter Parker is Spider-Man through.No Way Home is everything you wished for from a superhero movie. It provides a fast paced, well thought out plot with non-stop action sequences. And for a film filled with countless characters, everyone gets a chance to shine (that is something even Endgame couldn't do). Marvel Studios & Sony Pictures have done a great job at tricking everyone with their trailers because there are a lot of differences & additions to what we saw.The cast is top notch as always. The villains are many but they are all familiar faces & it was nice to see all of them again. Dafoe's Green Goblin proves yet again why he is Spidey's biggest (& best) villain. And it is good to see Electro lose his creepy blue look.Spider-Man: No Way Home lives upto the expectations & the hype. It does a lot of fan service but does not compromise on the plot in any way. It is one of the best Spider-Man... Marvel... Superhero movie of all time!", "8.6/10": "I saw this twice in cinemas, because I loved it so much. I don't generally see movies twice in cinemas unless I really like them- but this is definitely worth the watch. It's jam packed with nostalgia boosts, which is a good and bad thing, but the main problem is the plot. I found the plot slightly lousy, and how his only problem was that (Tom) Peters only problem is the fact him and his friend can't get into MIT, and not some life threatening problem. The problems come in later, however. Dafoe's performance was definitely the best in this movie, and I enjoyed all of the references between Tobey's Peter and Doctor Octopus. One problem with Tobey's Peter is that he never interacted with green goblin during the entire film. I think this film is amazing for a comic book film, and definitely the best Spider-Man movie out there.", "Very Good - Too Long": "I'm not a fan of multiverse plots generally but they did a nice job in this movie of bringing together the disparate Spider-Man movies of past and present and making them all fit in a somewhat rational way. Unfortunately the pacing sputters too often. Some scenes are unnecessarily talky and just drag out too long - a common problem with many movies in recent years. If they had carved out about 20 minutes from the runtime, this would have been much more compelling.", "Another fan service Marvel Movie": "The movie is quite good when it's about nostalgia. But where is the magic of directing we use to have with directors like Sam Raimi. The story is very simple and the action scenes are way too simples and ugly. The movie has no visual ambition, it just gives to the fans what they want to see. A great Marvel movie but not a great movie.", "Good movie...but": "Is this film worth such high rating? I don't think so.

My theatre was cheering, going crazy, etc. It reminded me when I saw Endgame. The cheering, clapping, etc. If you like Marvel movies you will love this movie. Lots of cameos. Otherwise, stay home.", "Found A Home": "I'm not a Spider-Man fan. What a weird way to start a review that you can clearly see I rated 9/10 I know. What I mean by this is I've seen almost all of the Spiderman films, however I've always watched as more of a casual observer rather an avid enthusiast or hardcore fan. I felt most of the films were pretty good but I was never particularly blown away with any of them. Toby was the best Spider-Man in my opinion but perhaps that stems from my teenage years and lusting over Kirsten dunst who played MJ.Seeing Tom Holland take up the role of Spider-Man I became a fan of his but as a firmly \"grown-up\" 30 years of age I couldn't connect as fully with the teenage romances any longer. I still enjoyed all of the recent films but with No Way Home I was massively impressed how they managed to put together such a great film and truly draw me back in.The fact they managed to get all 3 previous Spider-Man's to make an appearance in one movie is surreal but they also managed to tell a somewhat coherent story and have it be emotional and engaging, which I really enjoyed. The timing of this worked out perfectly to get all three actors back and have it play out so wonderfully, so for that alone it gets some points.Toby's first appearance on screen got a big \"ohhhh\" from the people in the cinema screening I attended and more so than any film in quite awhile myself and others were laughing out loud at some of the jokes. No crying with laughter and most are a giggle at most but a few genuinely made me laugh out which is surprising to me.The action, like with all Marvel movies is excellently done with great special effects and CGI looking as good as it ever has. As previously mentioned the story is very well told with lots of light hearted jokes to carry you through the more dramatic moments. The ups and downs of the storyline kept the pacing consistent and I never felt the film slow down at all which is a huge plus, it was a film you can easily focus on entirely for the full 2+ hours which is great. The ending felt like a fitting conclusion, but also a beginning of things to come, which left me very enthusiastic for any future films. The post credit scene with Venom had me excited to see what comes next as I'm a big fan of Tom Hardy and although I don't think the Venom films are the absolute best they could have been, I'm nevertheless intrigued to see Venom appear in the next Spider-Man and see how both of the Toms Interact with each other on screen.There's really not that much else to say other than I was really happy walking out of the cinema and I honestly can't say I've had a film make me feel that way in a long time. I guess I'm a fan of Spider-Man after all.", "Unreal... absolutely unreal": "Been a Spider-Man fan all my life. Grew up watching Tobey and Andrew and been a fan of the MCU ever since I went to see Iron Man (2008) when I was 6. This movie was my idea of the perfection.

I feel like the only thing that could make this movie better is the poster design. Otherwise 10/10.", "Wow wow wow wow wow!!!": "Man, what an experience!!!

The adrenaline and emotions in this film are overwhelming and I most definitely will watch it a couple of time in the upcoming weeks.I loved how this mixed nostalgia with high-tech. Seeing Andrew Garfield again in the red suit was super emotional and Tobey Maguire was more loveable than on his three movies.Daredevil being was a great delight and unexpected.Tobey being the wise, Andrew being the broken and Tom being the most energetic Spider-Man gave a great balance to the characters.The movie wasn't lacking in humourous scenes and teen drama. Strange was amazing as ever but the villains.....\nFoxx, Molina and Defoe might have been the best if it weren't for the 3 spiders. They did a very good job and it was fun to watch.The script was amazing and the fighting scenes were easy to follow.My favourite scene.....Andrew Garfield helping Tobey Maguire with his back pain and the two \"other universe\" heroes having no clue what Avengers was.

See it for yourselves, you will not be disspointed.", "inflated scores for infallible heroes": "It felt like watching a series of trailers for Columbia Pictures movies.Dont bother following the plot because the entire two-hour plot is erased by one of dr stranges spells in the last ten minutes of the movie. Except for may dying, for some reason, she stays dead. Because haha peter needs to cry at a funeral for it to be considered a spider-man trilogy.When all three spidermans meet in the movie, they immediately began fighting to see who has the biggest web-shooter. Then they hug each other the rest of the movie. Next tom holland tries to murder willem dafoe, but decides not to because tobey macguire gets stabbed. But then macguire gets up and is like, \"im fine,\" and then they all hug each other again. That was it. Disney morality was strong with this one. You could tell they felt really proud of themselves for \"righting\" the wrongs of the other two spider-man franchises.

Parker was a little whiny and immature (for a superhero, anyway,) Strange was reckless, and everything that happened was unnecessary and totally irresponsible. Seems like Marvel movies are becoming more about the main character cleaning up the mess that THEY created! Who was the actual villain in this movie?? I think someone needs to give Chris Evans a call and offer him a blank check because it's time to bring Cap back!

And for Marvels please make few more parts with the real spider man i mean with Tobey Maguire he deserves the farwell for what he dose for spider man and marvel.. he took the spider man character and marvel comics to each and every house hold world wide.", "Genius & nostalgic": "This movie did a great move that made other Marvel movies make sense, it's best point was the nostalgia and hints more like a tribute to Spiderman fans, yet not a top dialog or story really .. again just a link that is overall great.", "Completes Every Spider-Man Film and Captures the True Essence of Spider-Man": "There are two points of Spider-Man that every single film focuses on in some way shape or form, and those two points are part of what makes Spider-Man, well, Spider-Man.1. When I was a kid and watching all the Tobey Maguire films, I always noticed one thing: Spider-Man didn't kill and always tried to save the villain. He had a personal tie to each one of the villains, and it was a personal quest to try to convince the villain of their evil ways. Granted, the main antagonist in every film did die, but none by Spider-Man's doing. This was, for the most part, continued in every Spider-Man film that followed the Tobey Maguire trilogy: Spider-Man doesn't kill, and always tries to redeem the villain.2. While it was sometimes handled in an uncomfortable and overdramatic way, every Spider-Man had to try to balance the social life of a teenager/young adult while being Spider-Man. And, with this, there was always the inevitability of those personal Spider-Man villains hurting those close to Peter Parker, particularly the girlfriend character. This led to tough relationships, breakups, and even in The Amazing Spider-Man 2, the death of Gwen Stacy. Every Spider-Man has the duty to protect the one he loves, and to make sure they don't get hurt.While there are other points of Spider-Man that make a good movie, like character growth, cool action sequences, and nostalgia plays (Which, oh boy, does this movie have all of those. More of that in a minute), If these two points are stressed and well done, then the movie will be good. This movie knocks both of them out of the park. Throughout the movie Peter Parker (Tom Holland) gains a personal connection with each of the villains, especially Green Goblin. After Goblin kills Aunt May, Spider-Man has a strong desire to seek revenge on Goblin. However, throughout the film, he is adamant to send home the villains with a second chance. At the end he does, curing the villains of their calamity that helped form the villain in them. He even cures Goblin, with the help of a pep-talk from Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man.On the second point, at the end of the movie it is revealed that in order to reverse the spell that is breaking the universe, Spider-Man must have Doctor Strange cast the spell that has everyone forget Peter Parker is Spider-Man. They also forget that Peter Parker even exists. When this happens, Ned and MJ, Peter's best friend and girlfriend, forget he is Spider-Man. He goes to re-meet them and tell them about everything they have been through together, but when he sees MJ's scar on her head from a previous battle, he chooses not to tell her to protect her from getting hurt, therefore giving up a normal life with her in order to protect her.On top of mastering both of these points, the movie also builds upon predefined characters and adds depth and connection to them without rewriting the characters completely. The most noticeable and best performed one, in my opinion, was Green Goblin. His dual personality and internal struggle is more defined in this than in the original, and the \"Goblin personality\" is truly scary at times. The other two Spider-Men and their interaction is also incredible, and seeing all the familiar faces does wonders for Spider-Man fans. The plot of the film is great, to the point, and without unnecessary agendas and political messages. It finally gives us a finale to both the Maguire and Andrew storylines, while wrapping up Peter's storyline. The story is truly about free will and second chances and takes the cake as the best Spider-Man movie, and perhaps the best Marvel Movie.Also, Matt Murdock was an interesting and unexpected cameo.", "Surprising and entertaining superhero fun": "Positive:\noutrageously entertaining and dry-humored, but at the same time emotional, tragic and gloomynon-stop surprisesthe once again fantastic Tom Holland gives his character a whole new depth and the chemistry with Zendaya is phenomenalbanging action and an impressive excursion into the mirror dimensionmany future MCU spoilers and an exciting cliffhanger at the endNeutral:\nmerging with the non-MCU Spider-Man films (enriches the story, but feels somehow wrong to bring back these old characters)Negative:\nletting May die (in this way), only to give him his own \"with great power comes great responsibility\" moment.", "The Best Tribute there ever could be for Spiderman fans !": "THE BEST SPIDERMAN MOVIE TILL DATE !!Again Marvel leaves me speechless !!Won't say much here, just these words -Goosebumps, Crazy cheering, Genuine laughs, Teary eyes, Nostalgia & Enormous clapping !!Yes, an experience I won't forget any time soon !Still trying to come to terms with the fact that literally whatever I wanted this movie to have.... was there & in fact it was way more than my expectations !!A blockbuster, entertainer !!Please JUST DON'T MISS THIS SPECTACLE !You just can't afford to !IT'S A MUST WATCH !! \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcafAnd thank you soooooo much Marvel Studios for bringing back childhood memories & making me feel like a 10-year old kid yet again !

I am so impressed with this movie. It has now become my favorite movie in the MCU, which a great part has to do with my favorite superhero being Spider-Man.The audience at my theater was great too. First time in so long seeing it so packed, and it was filled with tons of fans. There was so much clapping and cheering for so many scenes, such as Daredevil's, Tobey, and especially Andrew's debut, but even some people screaming \"NO\" when Aunt May died.Very cool seeing all of the villains back, especially Willem DeFoe's Green Goblin, as he is the best movie Spider-Man villain to date, in my opinion.Not much to critique about this movie.

After \"Loki\" and \"What If\", it is the right prelude to the Multiverse that we'll see in the second movie dedicated to Doctor Strange.Although the plot is simple and with a hole in it, I was very happy to see the historical Spider-Man villains coming into the MCU. The story resume from the last seconds of \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" when everyone found out the superhero identity and now Peter wants everybody to forget it. In the course of the movie don't miss plot twist, unexpected behaviour changes from some characters and action, thanks even to Doctor Strange who, because of Peter, makes a mess and tries to fix it.It's a movie that made me laugh, cry and hope with the main characters.", "Wow. I'm speechless": "They absolutely nailed it.Probably the best Spider-Man movie to date .And the best part is it sets up everything good to come and the Spider-Man we know and love is here .", "A film for old school Spiderman fans": "As a huge Spiderman fan this movie was grand. This is truly the endgame to Spiderman fans.The movie centers around Spiderman who's secret identity is revealed. He then asks Doctor Strange to undo the identity reveal. A tampering with the spell unleashes the multiverse and Spiderman now has to face a lot of villains.While no way home isn't all it could be I smiled from start to finish. So many references and familier faces that just hits your nostalgia. A fair warning, this movie is not a casual watch. If you are not a Spiderman fan from back in the day, I don't know if this movie will click with you.All the performances are great, even though there is a lot of chatecters that deserved more screentime and chatecter arks. It is a balancing act when it comes to big ensemble movies that sadly always leaves someone in the dust.Tom Holland is a great performer in this film and it might be his best Spiderman performance to date. He is overshadowed by the returning cast and kinda takes a backseat from everything after a big turning point in the movie.The plot is simple yet effective. It dose what it has to do without any big bravado.The movie is rather mediocre but all of the things it has going for it heavely outweighs what it hasn't. It's an enjoyable watch that simply left me smiling.Spoilers!Seeing the three iterations of Spiderman acting, having fun and heart to hearts is probably my favorite part of the movie and also the part I wish we had more of. The scene where we see Andrew and Toby is a really amazing part.Doctor octopus is a great villan turning hero that I again would love to see more of together with the rest of the villans. There are glimses of a great plot and chatecters but they are quickly drowned in action scenes.Andrew saving Gwen is a strong and emotional scene that really got to me.Willem Dafoe is a great villan and the one with the greatest ark and focus. His performance really sells the chatecter and what the movie is about. Staying true to who we are.", "So much hype buy nothing amazing to offer": "Childish Storyline. They also ruined Tobey and Andrew's Spiderman. Disappointed. Peter And MJ's love scenes were awkward. Spiderman and Dr. Strange's fight was great tho. But Last fighting scene was boring, nothing impressive. This movie should have been like Avengers level if you are bringing back old Spiderman.", "Different from any other Spider-Man movie": "Sony has taken an unexpected decision to make the movie comedy than action, maybe for me the movie was fewer action moments than any other spider-man movie, the villains look to me have a weak screenplay to make them in dramatic theme the screenplay makes them a comedian's characters, and that was confused to me maybe one or two villains was better.Peter Parker in the same way in three parts he hasn't social skills and he is always light-hearted and the director Jon watts kept him in that way in three parts and that was good for me, ned and MJ was funny but happy Hogan hasn't much in movie and Aunt May was a really good part in the movie, but Willem Dafoe and Jaime Foxx weren't good in the movie I think they are not prepared to the movie, Alfred Molina was really good they specific using de-aging technologyJon watts give me a comedy movie, a parely drama/action movie, but he forgot is that spiderman movie, the action scenes weren't invested so much I think Far From Home has the best action scenes between three parts.The music was really good from Michael Giacchino I love the mixed soundtrack between Dr strange and spiderman theme.The CGI was good but sometimes I feel the characters' moves were a cartoon but I think the night scenes were really good and I see everything through night scenes.From me, the movie was relative sometimes I love it, sometimes disappointed because the screenplay wasn't good and I wasn't imagining the screenplay to be great but it was messy and mixed between drama and comedy moments.No way home was an enjoyable movie for me, but I feel miss the MCU movies and spiderman movies feeling, For me, it was a big fan service movie.Rating 7.5/10.", "Mind Blown, Watch with Fans!!!": "The hype is real! I enjoyed every aspect of this film because everything I would never imagine happening in the cinematic Marvel universe occurred in this film.Let us focus on the setup. For over a year, I grew in anticipation of how the world would react to discovering Spider-Man's true identity. And let's just say the film depicted this well. The drama and domino effect of learning Spider-man's identity caused an influx of intentional and emotional scenes that immersed me in the movie. This film had many scenes highlighting the complexities and beauty of being Spider-Man's. We grew up watching different universes, yet having them come together felt blissful. With various comical scenes, more specifically the scene towards the end with all three Spider-Man engaging in a long yet necessary dialogue about being \"amazing\" or web fluid added to the overall appeal. With these \"easter eggs\" scenes, it's clear to see this film is the definition of Spider-Man pop culture. For my Spider-man Marvel fans, there is a lot to unpack., there are many hints towards potential future projects such as Miles Morales, and foreshadowing for Ned, just to name a few. The film does a terrific job incorporating spider man memes, intentionally accumulating possibilities and what we want as fans. Because everything seems to affect the Marvel universe.On the other hand, this film incorporated a lot of emotion. Reliving the traumas the previous Spider-Man's faced in conjunction with fresh wounds. I felt as if I experienced everything they felt. And the crazy part is that it is just the tip of the iceberg. We haven't experienced Tom Holland's Spider-Man transform his jolly teen apparatus until this film. The darkness that occurred was necessary for us to see the range of this Marvel Universe Spider-Man.Additionally, it is important to note how spot on his character is, focusing on the wrong things, letting emotion overshadow his judgment. Some of the things he says make you remember he is only 17 years old in the film. This film allowed us to reminisce on Spider-Man we grew up with while also growing with the current one.Verdict: Spider-Man No Way Home swings in for a home run! This film had a great mixture of nostalgia, action, iconic scenes, Easter eggs( in dialogue included), Marvel characters, drama, comedy, love, and growth. It is tough to say a film is perfect. Yet, given its complexities and delivery, maybe even the appeal of seeing this opening night, this is by far one of the best Marvel films.Does this take me to paradise: Absolutely!", "Cringe": "Cringe and dorky...wanted it better ...so dissapointed.i expected a lot more going on especially with the villain characters ..and the cgi was questionable and the plot was just not catchy..all we see is the dorkiness..they shouldve done so much better..but many of the fans wont bother about that and be biased...all they wanted to see were three spidermen come together ...that made me happy as well but they didnt put it good use..just disappointed.", "Melhor Filme de Her\u00f3i": "Melhor Filme de Her\u00f3i de Todos os Tempos Com certeza,Supera Vingadores 3 e 4,as Intera\u00e7\u00f5es foram muito boas e a Com\u00e9dia do filme tbm,n\u00e3o disperdi\u00e7aram uma Piada,S\u00f3 n\u00e3o gostei da tia May ter morrido mas mesmo assim eh um Pecado dar 9 estrelas pra um filme desses.", "Nice job!": "Well...i have to say i can't imagine this one without tobey and andrew, 'cause maybe it would've been a battle without sth new!but a huge well-done to the the first suggestion to this reunion!

I didn't like how they make problem from nothing they make the villains came and be good then he capture them then he let them escape to help them and they became good then the transfer to bad was really quick i think they could find some better way to make the villains in this movie.finally how toby maguire and andrew garfield they enter the movie it was like a theater i had some feelings that when toby megure showed up that he was waiting for the crowd to claps before he start talking and i didn't like how they knew everything and not 1% surprised.But it really was unique experience how they put 20 years in one film especially for those who like me saw the first movie of toby maguire on cinema it's bring back good feeling.", "This is one of the best MCU movies.": "-I did not like an mcu movie this much since Endgame.-Now i can say that Tom Holland became spider man.-They Did Justice to Other Characters and Did not Disrespect Them.I loved the end of the movie._ now i have hope for the MCU.", "One of the best movie of all time": "Best spiderman movie I have seen ever and the greatest thing is this more than I expected the dialogue and scene are awesome you should really watch it if you are spiderman fan.", "Simply Epic": "I had a lot of expectations going into this movie, I read some non spoiler reviews of it and some of them said it's the best movie in the MCU. In my opinion it's not, but it's very very close, IMHO Thor Ragnorok is virtually perfect. This does come very very close, in terms of sheer scale it's on par with Civil War, some proper geek out moments. I won't spoil them, because it's totally worth going to see it at the cinema, my biggest nerd moment seemed to be a bit different to other peoples judging off the gasps and applause from the audience. Let's just say I like Netflix shows.In terms of its 'epicness' I think it falls a little short of Endgame although my two daughters who I went with thought it was on a grander scale to endgame and infinity war. I will leave that to your own judgement.We all now know that Tom Holland has signed on again the put the spandex suit on, but this would have been a great ending to Tom's tenure as Spidermsn, many people are crying out for a more diverse lead character, and they actually comment upon this in the movie.It was a long film so stock up on the snacks and drinks, but to be fair at no point did I think the film was dragging its feet to fill the time.In summary a damned good film, up there with the best the MCU has to offer but not in my opinion the GOAT.First post credit scene was amazing, and it still bemuses me after so many MCU Films the amount of people who get up and leave, they don't even put the lights on anymore like they used to. I was rather confused by the second end credits scene, it wasn't a scene it was a trailer for the next Doctor Strange movie .Now this is the bit of my review that will look very strange if after many years IMDB is still going strong (thanks Amazon) - it was very difficult sitting with a mask on for the whole length of the film, I am also pleased to announce that 99% of the audience complied with the order to 'mask up'\nThere was a couple of eejits who were not wearing a mask, and they were not challenged by the staff either (they were not showing exempt notices). To give the @odeonsilverlink some credit, most of the people on the 'shop floor' were either at school or college/uni so I wouldn't really expect them to challenge someone for not wearing a mask. It shouldn't have to rely on other audience members to say anything, this should be done by the management or supervisorsWell I managed to create a spoiler free review, I'm happy with myself.", "Best Spider-Man Movie Ever I Love it": "I Love this Movie I Love seeing the old Cast together, that was Awesome and I Love the story of how it was exciting and funny and sad and intense.

Since then, audiences have been treated to seven live action solo films and one brilliant animated movie that took the world by force and introduced viewers to a new type of hero. With Spider-Man: No Way Home, the eighth solo story and the third under the watchful eye of Kevin Feige in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the trilogy of films meant to introduce the avenging neighborhood hero to the universe has landed, with multiverse-spanning ramifications.Following the events of Spider-Man: Far From Home, and Mysterio's revelation to the world that Peter Parker is indeed the Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, Peter is left to deal with the devastating fallout that impacts his personal life. Determined to find a way to fix the situation Aunt May and his friends find themselves in, Peter turns to fellow Avenger Doctor Strange. In attempt to cast a spell meant to wipe the world's mind of Mysterio's ousting, Peter's constant demands of tweaks to the spell cause it to go awry, cracking open the multiverse and allowing foes from former Spider-Man movies to cross over to his own. What ensues is the most entertaining, emotional, and mind-blowingly astonishing Spider-Man adventure to ever be put on screen.Starring Tom Holland in his sixth appearance as the web head, No Way Home shows the actor back in the ease of a familiar role. After his two subpar films released earlier in the year, Cherry and Chaos Walking, his return to the role he's helped redefine for a new generation of moviegoers is welcome. In this turn, Holland's Peter Parker is darker, more desperate than we've ever seen him. There's shades of Return of the Jedi in this film as Peter toys closer to outright villainy than we've ever seen on screen (no, whatever that was in Raimi's Spider-Man 3 aint it). The shades of the old Marty McFly Peter are still present at times, but now Holland has managed to amplify that with levels of conflict, uncertainty, and indecisiveness. For all his character has been through, from ditching out of house parties and homecoming to being exposed to the world to handling grief and loss, it's time to crown Tom Holland as the superior Spider-Man.Also starring Zendaya and Jacob Batalon as MJ Watson and Ned Leeds respectively, the two combined with Holland continue to make a delightful grouping when on screen together. Ned's persistent youthful ebullience and optimism is counterbalanced by MJ's realist sensibilities with Holland in between. More emotional work is given to both Zendaya (no stranger to drama) and Batalon, both of whom more than rise to the challenge. Revolving in and out of the film is Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Stephen Strange, his first significant screen time since 2018's Infinity War. Cumberbatch picks up where he last left the character as an arrogant, stubborn man that's still capable of helping those in desperate need. Strange's matter-of-fact nature of what needs to be done, and his frustrations with Peter, are played admirably by Cumberbatch, also managing to give more depth to the character.As for our villains, most are a welcome return to the Spider-Man franchise. Much of the spotlight is given to Doc Ock, Green Goblin, and, surprisingly, Electro. Molina still manages to find facets to the character he played 16 years prior, giving the audience a feeling of the familiar while somehow being different. Doc Ock's trajectory throughout the film is possibly the most predictable but still entertaining, nevertheless. Jamie Foxx's Electro is given the most glow up in the film, replacing the ridiculous blue look from Amazing Spider-Man 2 and giving him a more normal, grounded look. Dillon's quest for power in the film is the stuff of Spider-Man lore and Foxx manages to bring his trademark charm and humor to the role in a way that was sadly restricted in his first outing as the electric villain. Rhys Ifans and Thomas Hayden Church briefly reprise their roles physically as The Lizard and The Sandman, but their contributions are mostly limited to voice work for their respective computer-generated characters. Of all the sinister villains in Spidey's retinue, these two are mostly given the backseat so the others can develop.Willem DaFoe as Norman Osborne, the Green Goblin singlehandedly steals every scene he's in. His ability to shift from contrite to evil and back as easily as changing shirts makes for some the best parts of the movie. It's easy to see that DaFoe had a blast returning to the character as he cackles, manipulates, and pumpkin bombs his way through the film. This is the Green Goblin die-hard fans have been waiting so long to see on screen: a completely unhinged man whose gleeful desires to ruin Spider-Man's life in every conceivable way make him one of the most dangerous in his rogue's gallery.Directed by Jon Watts, the first MCU director to handle a trilogy from start to finish, Spider-Man: No Way Home demonstrates his ability to balance character and nonstop action. Showcasing everything from amazing set pieces to quieter focus on motivations and desires, Watts and writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers manage to pack a lot of wrap up and setup in the film's lengthy runtime. The unwieldy setup for the initial act is the film's weakest point; while it all makes sense and moves along at a somewhat decent pace, the second act is where the pacing finds its footing and swings its way to the bombastic end. Amazing visual effects (expected when Doctor Strange is in the mix) and dynamic cinematography help to lend to both the fantasy elements, such as the Mirror Dimension, and the realism, like watching Peter websling. Watts has fully proven himself capable of handling large budgets and giant franchises, impressing the powers-that-be at Disney enough to give him the reigns to the upcoming Fantastic Four movie. It seems, as far as the Marvel Cinematic Universe, director Jon Watts is here to stay.Proper respects must also be given to composer Michael Giacchino's score. Giacchino has not so quietly become a leading figure in the world of cinematic composers, thanks to his work first on Lost and Incredibles before moving onto Star Trek and Jojo Rabbit. Here on No Way Home, Giacchino's music manages to rip the heart out of the audience just as often as it thrills and electrifies. His rousing action horns and quieter strings interweave to create a sensational work of art that is just as powerful as Watt's direction.Ultimately, Spider-Man: No Way Home wraps up a solid trilogy of movies in ways that are sure to delight, shock, and amaze. Tom Holland's electric performance, counterbalanced by Cumberbatch's stern, pragmatic nature makes for a great chemistry between the two that swings between playful charm and downright antagonistic. With a number of surprises, cheer worthy moments, and true anguish, Jon Watt's handling of the material makes the 148 minutes breeze by after the clunky setup of the first act. A testament to the staying power of the MCU, Disney continues to find new ways to subvert expectations and swing for the fences. Spider-Man: No Way Home is currently in theaters.", "\"AMAZING, SPECTACULAR, EPIC \"": "Easily the best Spider Man movie ever produced. Exceeds expectations, no MCU fan is ready for this one. Tom Holland is just excellent. Audiences will go crazy for every 5-10 minutes.", "Nostalgia and enjoyable": "It was more of a nostalgia rather than a great movie. I really enjoyed it though. The actors were pretty great and it was a good movie overall. I remembered my childhood with this movie :)", "This movie is amazing..": "I have watched all marvel movies and this is one of the best.

I could never really do much with most of the films in the so loved universe. If it wasn't for the one superhero called Spider-Man. The superhero I grew up with when the MCU was still in embryonic form. It was Tobey Maguire's films that brought me closer to the superhero genre and, to a certain extent, made me love it. Now, with No Way Home, the third Spider-Man saga around Tom Holland is coming to an end.The hype surrounding this film was reminiscent of box office hits like the final two Avenger films or James Cameron's Avatar. No trailer had been watched so often for years, rarely had there been so many fan theories and great expectations, and in a situation like now, when cinema is fighting for survival, the fear of failure has never been so great. The latter worry turned out to be unnecessary just a few days after the film's official release. The film opened in cinemas with a brilliant box-office result of 600 million US dollars, which is also the third-best (!) opening of a movie ever. Judging by the initial response, hardly any fans left the cinema disappointed. 9.1 out of 10 points on the largest film database ImdB currently means third place in the ranking of the best films of all time. All these facts clearly show that No Way Home will be the success that fans and cinema have been longing for. But is this overwhelming development justified? It wouldn't be a Marvel film if it didn't have the flaws of its predecessors in the franchise. The CGI feels largely rushed and fight scenes hardly generate any tension. There is an overabundance of characters, some of whom are used far too infrequently. After all, we meet villains from old Spider-Man films such as Alfred Molina as Dr. Otto Octavio or Willem Dafoe (the guy is just brilliant in everything) as Green Goblin again, and both they and the many others could have done more without the lack of backstory. Instead, the focus is on Peter Parker aka Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and his interpersonal relationships, such as with his beloved MJ (Zendaya), his best friend Ned (Jacob Batalon) or his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei). And here, No Way Home manages to do something that very few MCU films have done before. It manages to trigger emotions in me. To empathize with the characters and even make me forget Tom Holland's otherwise stony acting. Admittedly, Holland was by all means the perfect choice for the childlike Spider-Man. In the finale, however, he finally delivers the sample of talent I've been waiting for from him for years.What I particularly had with No Way Home, though, was fun. Screeching audiences, one liners that often hit the spot and the selection of characters all in all fit so well that no one really seemed interchangeable. Of course, it's debatable whether some of the cameo appearances were really needed. But for the first time in an actual ensemble film by Marvel, there was a cast that was right all around. Although this type of film was never my cup of tea, in hindsight I'm really glad to have been part of this cinematic experience. Frankly, I don't know how many more times I will see a full cinema with ecstatic viewers. So, MCU, I'm happy to forgive your previous mistakes after this film...at least temporarily.", "Very excellently done.": "I can now finally understand the people who told me it was one of the best Spider-Man films they have seen. We see all 3 Spider-Mans develop together. We see them overcome their past (or recent past) and learn to cure their antagonists. We see wholesome and sad moments in which they go through. This was also seen through other characters as well but this isn't meant to be an essay so I'll keep it short. The only reason why it isn't higher than 8/10 is that personally it was too slow at the start regarding its buildup to that point. Other than that, it was most definitely worthwhile watching.", "Best spidy movie": "Mcu and sony has taken the cinematic universe to another level and director webb and producer kevin done a hard work to present us best spiderman movie ever from start to end this will give thrilling experience and you will feel the goosebumps.", "Hands Down - The Best Spider-Man movie Since Spider-Man 2": "I'm not sure how they did it - Nor how they got approval to get this done... But this was fantastic. Sony owned the first Spider-Man franchise/ trilogy. Not sure who owned the next one. Marvel/Disney own the third spin-off/ reboot. I thought the third franchise was pretty good - at best. But this movie was a great way to extend the franchise and give long-time fans exactly what they wanted. Brilliant... really. First movie I have seen in a very long time that I already knew I wanted to see it twice before it was even close to being over.", "Meh...": "I think that \"Spider-man: No way home\" is a movie very overvalued. It has some problems of tempo and It hasn't too action. The first part of the film is awful and has too much comedy. The second part is too much better and has too much action and epic moments. To sum up, it could give much more.", "Amazing amazing amazing Spider-Man!": "This movie was perfection. I loved every second of it. I would go so far as to say that this is the best marvel movie I've ever scene. There were no disappointments whatsoever and it was done perfectly. Just watch the movie! Don't watch trailers or look online for spoilers or reviews! Just watch it!", "Movie that represents second chances": "Fan service but very much deserved. We waited for years, if not decades to experience something close to this, wish so unrealistic, there wasn't even a point, but it grew and grew, with each passing year, more memes, references, even the animated movie which made our craving so much worse! We finally got it and I couldn't be happier.No way home provides a sense of closure to the long-lasting, ever-growing wish to recapture a childhood as an adult once again. The movie is so meta, villains addressing topics brought up by memes, even repeating them word for word. When Defoe said that scientist line, I instinctively screamed, from then on it was an unending bliss.The general theme couldn't be more perfect, a second chance for villains, for heroes, and for all of us, to witness it all once again and this time united. The movie is clearly made with heart and love, understanding, and care. Characters are done justice, they serve their purpose. No time is wasted on explanations that are not needed, the assumption is that we come ready and that's the good part, we are rewarded for our interest and built-up dreams.I just wanna thank each person who worked on this, those who made it all happen, especially Tom and the director Jon, writers, and the whole cast. They know what they made and I'm sure praise will only skyrocket as more people get to witness it.Thanks, Tobey and Andrew. I grew up watching them, first as a kid then as a teen, and now again as an adult. Thanks for this second chance, it will not be taken for granted. You are amazing guys.This surely is the best timeline.", "Amazing! If not for Zendayas bad acting 10/10!": "Such a thrilling happening and fun movie. Despite a relatively long duration, I never felt bored while watching. Watch before you see any spoilers! The only con is Zendaya's incredibly shallow acting but it is nothing new to get disappointed about I guess.", "Okay": "This felt slightly disappointing, probably due to my over expectations from other reviews! Felt like the entire movie was shown in the trailer itself! Decent nostalgia moments though! Felt there were dragged emotional moments, which might have slowed down the pace of the film.", "Fantastic in terms of character": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is both a very good film and also a very bad film. First, the premise to this film is broken, particularly when it comes to the magic used, making the plot wonky in places. It raises many serious questions as to how the magic works and why it hasn't been used in the past to fix things. This is an issue because it seriously hurts the world-building of the MCU. Second, Doctor Strange was not himself in this film. The events that took place were fully his fault. He is not the type of person to simply do something without discussing it with someone else. This would have been acceptable had this film taken place during the movie Doctor Strange when he still had serious flaws (though he would not have been powerful enough to do what he did in this film, so that also wouldn't work), but by Infinity War it is clear he is very much a team player, or in other words, a good communicator. He would have sat down with Peter and discussed things with him before taking action. This misuse of his character began in Endgame and persists throughout most of this movie with the exception of when he says \"Don't!\" to Peter. Finally, I wonder why Wong didn't interfere with the situation, and I have other questions, but these are the main issues. So when you think about it, the premise of this movie falls apart. Now for the characters. Character is the most important part of a movie. If a film doesn't have good character writing, then you won't care about what happens in the story, even if the story makes sense. The director, Jon Watts, clearly understands the characters in this film. Not only are arcs from previous films completed, they are even improved upon. The emotional payoffs are massive and well-earned, and the stakes to this movie feel real. Tom Holland's skills really showed in this film and I didn't mind Zendaya as MJ. She acted like a human. The other actors also did a phenomenal job, and you grow to sympathize with their characters. This movie has an awareness of the real world/meta that is used in a excellent manner. It never comes across as cheap. The stellar characters who are at the heart of this story make this a very satisfying movie. I hope Jon Watts gets the opportunity to direct more Marvel films/shows. He clearly cares deeply about the characters. The rating of 5 does not mean the film failed. The rating of 5 means there are excellent elements to this film, but it is dragged down by very bad elements as well. The number 5 is a general guideline of the film, not a label for everything in it. The world-building is bad, and as a result, the plot is weak. The theme is strong, and the characters are terrific. There are definitely issues, but they still managed to achieve a cohesive central arc/theme throughout all three Spider-Man films, creating the best-realized trilogy in the MCU. This movie has a terrific ending. It completes the journey Peter began in Civil War. I would be happy if it ended here. Peter Parker has learned his lesson and is truly Spider-Man.", "Best superhero movie": "If you are spiderman fan then you should watch this movie. It has best Peter Parker tobey, best spider man Andrew Garfield and awesome Peter and spider man tom Holland.

Loads of Joy, Humor, \"NEW INFORMATION\", Sad, Character development. We maybe never see this type of movie ever again. Tom Holland performance is same as Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man. TOP TOP TOP LEVEL Performance. Zendaya, Jacob, Marissa Tomei & Jon Favreau having great performance of their life. Tons of easter egg and the villains just WOW. Willem Defoe played green goblin SUPERBLY as expected. Alfred Mollina as Doc Oc is Awesome and fun to watch him. Jamie Fox is funny even funnier than \"the first time we saw him\" . The fight scene is awesome, the effect is almost Perfect. Benedict Cumberbatch have very MAJOR role is the movie. Yes it is tied to Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness. There is two Credits Scene, Just stay until it Appear.", "Dr. Strange was awesome": "But you decide for yourself of it is a good thing Strange was the best part of a Spiderman movie with 3 Spidermen. It was kind of just a rehash if the Spiderman movies that came before it.", "A True Spiderman Spectacular": "My biggest problem with the Disney Spiderman movies is that they felt more like Avengers movies than Spiderman movies. Spiderman is far and away Marvel's best character and I felt that Disney did a disservice to the character by making him a side player in the Avengers and someone who completely plays second fiddle to Ironman in his own movie. While the Disney films were both well made and entertaining I felt they didn't display fully what Spiderman could be. The original Spiderman series was not necessarily well acted but it was iconic and entertaining, while Andrew Garfield's Spiderman went back to the traditional comicbook aspects of the character. I liked both these series better because, despite their flaws, they both undeniably made Spiderman the star, not just a player in a larger game of heroes.This Spiderman is a love letter to the character. By bringing back the big screen villains and thankfully Andrew and Toby, we are given a fun , though imperfect, romp. Yes there are plot holes and it's not all great, but they tried and I appreciate that.", "An Amazing Spider-Man": "SPIDER-MAN NO WAY HOME is a grand entertainment that mixes action, comedy, and genuinely moving drama. While the roles may not always be the most challenging, the performances are all perfect for the material. The production values are excellent. The plot may borrow from many predecessors including SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE and even REMO WILLIAMS: THE ADVENTURE BEGINS. Spider-Man fans should love this, and more casual viewers should have a good time as well.", "I'm still processing it.": "It got me through all the emotions possible and some I didn't know I can feel. To be honest , i didn't think it'll be as good as everyone said , i was ready to be disappointed .I had big expectations, and the movie definitely exceeded them, and I am so glad it did. I still can't believe it's real and I am not exaggerating. Go and watch it.", "it exceeded our expectations!": "The film was great, the atmosphere in the theather was also phenomenal. As an eastern european, i have never expected our cinemas to clap and cheer during any movie, so it was very moving when the latter happened. We also clapped after the movie kind of as a 'thank you' for this incredible and moving experience, since the iconic actors and characters really put all their hearts into this movie and made us feel nostalgic and grateful.

There's existing footage of Peter Parker as Spiderman and therefor countless of witnesses of the specific face that he has. But Doctor Strange somehow managed to erase the memory of Peter Parker but kept the ones of Spiderman. How is this possible since billions of people already have connected a specific face to the Spiderman? Did Doctor Strange somehow edit the footage (by adding a mask) of Peter Parker as Spiderman? I'm just unable to add up how he managed to make a person that the public knows as one into two. Disney clearly went all in on the nostalgia factor (as usual) and successfully made people blind to how lazy the writing was. There's so much more to point out but it's honestly not worth the time.

Whatever the producers may claim, for the audience it mainly looked like the story-writers had run out of ideas and was just using that episode as a stop-gap episode.Well, this movie somehow felt to be in the same vein; recycling previous Spideys and previous Spidey villains as the story writers have run out of ideas. I doubt very much that the Spiderman comics ever indulged in stories like this. What a boring movie and what a load of junk.", "Spider-Man: No Way Home - Fanservice Done Right": "The hype for this movie was immense when it came out and I have to say it didn't dissapoint. This movie is filled with great performances from Tom Holland, Willem Dafoe, Zendaya, and some who I can't get into without going into spoilers. This is an emotional journey filled with hype moments, tense moments, and absolutely devastating moments. The opening of the movie can feel a little rushed at times though. It feels like it is scrambling to get all the characters in their places for the 2nd and 3rd acts but in the end it isn't that big of a complaint.

WOW (Spider-Man: No Way Home Review)": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is the best Spider-Man Movie ever! I mean, everything is done right, and it boosted Tom Holland's Spider-Man to the top, as he is the Spider-Man the fans have been waiting for. This is a emotional movie, a suspenseful movie, and overall, an amazing comic book movie! Seeing the villains all come back was absolutely incredible, and oh my god, Willem Dafoe's acting is literally phenomenal! He can change between Norman Osborn and Green Goblin like day and night! Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus is awesome, and by the end of this movie, you love him! And the new design they gave Jaimie Foxx's Electro looks great, but I felt like Sandman and The Lizard were sort of sidelined, but they were still fun to watch their interactions with the others. But now, let's just cut to the chase, seeing Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield back in the Spider-Man Roles was emotional and awesome to see on screen, and the applause and cheering that followed was just a dream come true! The Three Spideys Banter together is so fun and enjoyable to see on screen. And even seeing Ned and MJ talk to them was fun! May's Death was really sad, and it really tugged your heartstrings, and Doctor Strange's addition in the movie was fun! And when we get to that ending, where Tom's Peter makes the sacrifice to save the Multiverse, it gets really emotional!Overall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a perfect movie on every single level!", "Spider-man no way home!": "It is a very great and indescribable movie that gave me everything I wanted from comedy, drama, action, breathtaking moments, sad scenes and sentences that take you back to the past, I want to commend Tom Holland because in this film I was able to see his true acting abilities, and what can I say about Andrew Garfield He is a great actor and grabbed the spotlight from all the actors, so I felt that he was better than Tom Holland, the hero of this movie, and also Tobey Maguire. He performed great, but he was the least among them. The only weak point in this movie is the marginalization of some villains such as the lizard and the sandman.

The characters and the whole story of the movie make sense with the others spiderman-films, quite touched and surprised each second. Chapeau!", "The actual story is OK but you have to suffer thru endless pointless fight scenes": "The actual story is OK but you have to suffer thru endless pointless fight scenes that go on interminably and everyone knows how they will end. It really gets tedious. The special effects also suffer from having all been seen before in one form or another. So while the multiarmed thing is pincherIng it's way to get spiderman all I can think is cool graphics, I know who wins in the end so there's no tension or drama. The whole movie is that way, no real tension or drama.The original spiderman premise was that spiderman is special but not exactly supernatural. He was bitten by a spider and got superhuman powers.. fine.. but he's not a god, not a magician and the events don't take place in a magical fairyland. In this movie they added way too much MAGIC to the spiderman universe... was I watching spiderman or Merlin? Looks like part of the reason was to set things up for future Doctor Stange movies.The best part of the movie is when the two previous Spidermen appear in order to give the current Spiderman some moral and physical support. That part was really well written and enjoyable to watch. Tobey McGuire will always be my favorite spiderman. Tom Holland just doesn't have any gravitas for the part and Andrew Garfield looks too rabbinical.If you are any sort of Spiderman movie fan you will enjoy the movie regardless of these shortcomings.", "Your friendly neighborhood therapist": "As I went to the cinema to see Marvel and Jon Watts' third installment of Tom Holland's teenage Spider-Man we had the usual discussion about the differences between a Marvel movie and everything else. And while I had, in the back of my head, Scorsese's claims that Marvel movies are nothing more than entertainment--a claim which I still think is a bit too harsh--we both agreed that this giant's agenda does not contain artistic ambitions--at least not at the expense of the entertainment.Our disagreements came at the statement on whether we consider \"funny\" and \"entertaining\" enough to produce a great movie--while I believe these are positive traits, they can only do so much and can rarely reach greatness. He scuffed at my pretentions and said: \"Marvel knows how to make feel-good movies\"--I was almost jealous at how good he put it. This is as straight-forward and as blunt as it gets.So, while \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is not much more than entertainment, it's top quality entertainment: calculated, sprinkled with Marvel's trademark humor which is often placed among the darkest of situations yet somehow never seeming out-of-place. But these are all generic characteristics, fitting of most Marvel films. What really makes this particular movie stand out, though, is its ability to shift seamlessly from joy to agony, from achievement to loss and from celebration to tragedy. Towards its ending, it moved me more than most Marvel movies did and it contained more morality than I expected.In a way, despite its economic approach--not to mention the silly way in which the plot was catalyzed--this movie reminded me of the late Stan Lee's emotional wisdom when he created this universe. As Spider-Man learns what it means to be a hero, so do we, as an audience, get a refresher on the importance of sacrifice and forgiveness. Here, for instance, the villains are viewed through very different eyes. In the interest of not spoiling, I will draw a social parallel towards mental health--and the patience and understanding the long-sufferers of these conditions require from the rest of us. Here, Tom Holland's Peter Parker acts as a therapist of sorts, a social idealist whose fixation on second chances almost rivals that of Batman's own no-killing-permitted moral code.The second half of \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\", which encompassed tragedy, showed me a side of Marvel which I haven't seen since \"Infinity War\". It is made of moments when even the wittiest of jokes know to step aside so that the movie's hero can grow. It's only a shame that Marvel is too good at pure-blood entertainment--not to mention it makes them too much money--to ever consider attempting anything more.", "Misused Original Spideys, could have been more": "All know. Sam Raimi Spiderman and amazing spiderman were way popular than this Iron boy Jr. They just wanted to show all spiderman in a movie ..thats all, no script ..nothing.

Lots of flaw, if everyone who knew peter parker came back even from dead then where Mary Jane and Gwen Stacy go? And in overnight all spiderman got antidots for all villains.

However, some scenes feel forced and, for me, miss the joke. In addition, some of them seem to be targeted at a younger audience.The main plot feels a bit dragged out and did not progress as fast as I had wished. \"Spiderman Far From Home\" is undoubtedly a fan service as the movie includes the past versions of \"Spiderman\".

The iconic characters from previous Spiderman films does return and with good closure for each of them.A film shifts up it gear with involvement of Dr Strange and goes bullet speed after introduction of a few more \"cameos\" from alternate universes.Marvel did pull off the live action spiderverse with such grace and charisma.Those who doubted Marvel to pull off another Infinity War/ Endgame would've to admit there is nothing impossible for Marvel since they've the budgets and they've the brains.You can listen to all the spoilers, and all the hypes, multifold your expectations and , this film will blow your mind.

But the incredible hype around the third spider movie and the warm attitude towards the hero himself made me wait for \"There is no way home\", and even go to the premiere.According to the plot, after the whole world found out who was hiding behind the spider mask (I hope this is not a spoiler for anyone), Peter Parker's life turned into a nightmare. Journalists and onlookers do not give a pass, plus not everyone considers him a hero, which has an extremely negative impact on the quality of life of Peter, his girlfriend MJ and best friend Ned.

This movie brings back the OLD CAST of the PREVIOUS SPIDER-MAN films back in this movie for the same role and yet, played them DIFFERENTLY. So, there was a lot of NOSTALGIA linked to it and with the INVOLVMENT of these OLD CHARACTERS, inevitably a lot of expectations are attached to it too. So, keeping all that in mind, I think MARVEL did an AMAZING JOB with all the FIGHTING SCENES of THOSE CHARACTERS and their DIALOUGE DELIVERY was on POINT too. Except I believe that, Andrew Garfield's and Tobey Maguire's versions of SPIDER-MAN deserved a better INTRODUCTION in the MOVIE. Although, appearence of every OLD CHARACTER in the film made it very NOSTALGIC by their DIALOUGES and FIGHTING SKILLS\nand a LOT of FAN THEORIES were also added into the FILM with regards to these OLD CHARACTERS which made it even more entertaining.The ENDING of the MOVIE is the MOST DEVASTATING and yet, the most UNIQUE ENDING, compared to any other MARVEL MOVIE. With this Movie, MARVEL has reached HEIGHTS! The Background Music that was NEWLY ADDED to the MOVIE and the ones that were repeated from PREVIOUS SPIDER-MAN films, made the movie MUCH MORE ENTERTAINING and NOSTALGIC, simantenously. REFERENCES were VERY SMARTLY ADDED into the FILM as usual.I would hence rate this movie a 9-star and undoubtedly accept the fact that this is one of the biggest MARVEL PROJECTS, so far.", "\"Strong Enough to Have it All...Too Weak to Take It.\"": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is the last in the latest kinetic but emotion-free Spider-Man trilogy. Fortunately, No Way Home bucks the trend of the last two films, providing legitimate thrills alongside legitimate emotion. The film is reasonably contemplative and satisfying, with sterilized but large-scale action and some interesting nostalgia thrown in for good measure. In fact, and shockingly, the nostalgia of the film is given more than a passing glance; it's the bedrock of the film, which makes it far more engaging and less cheaply manipulative than many recent releases.The film follows Peter Parker as he battles the forces of outside universes and applies for college admission. It features Doctor Strange, who helps kick the plot into gear when he brings Spider-Man's old foes, including Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus, Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, and Jamie Foxx's Electro, into the Holland-led franchise. With the help of his friends and some old allies, Peter Parker attempts to \"cure\" his foes of their villainy before sending them back to their original universes.The film opens wobbly but once the action is underway, it rarely lets up. There are many surprising and grounded moments spread throughout the film which add the aforementioned emotional weight, coupled with a surprisingly small, personal scope. The film may involve multiple universes, but it's firmly fixed on Parker and his personal growth. The stakes are elevated to a fever pitch before all hell breaks loose and the real fun starts. Overall, it's a nicely structured story, excluding the rushed, exposition-heavy first fifteen minutes.No Way Home is rather enigmatic; the film is not radically different from many films in the MCU, but it's personal story and grounded emotional stakes make it work far better than most. It's filmed in the typical Marvel assembly-line style and more concerned with a handful of unique and effective moments, rather than a broad, overarching storyline. It has some banter, but the quipping feels more organic and spontaneous than many of the James Gunn style shenanigans of late. It is undoubtably a product of its studio (Marvel, not Sony, the film's not a piece of crap) but differs in small, meaningful ways.The most unique and interesting idea in the film is bringing back past characters, from franchises that have long since ended. As impressive as setting up a multi-film villain like Thanos was, it doesn't match the audacity of bringing back characters and actors from ten to twenty years ago.It's more impressive still to incorporate them seamlessly into a new story, totally disconnected from their own but feeling intrinsically related. This trick could have easily gone wrong, and it's my guess that it will go wrong, when another, lazier, less competent studio tries it in the near future. But No Way Home gets it right; it feels fresh, meticulous, and groundbreaking.To reiterate: this is not a rote idea or a minor accomplishment of easy execution. Popular culture is in a crisis, depressingly oversaturated with cheap nostalgia and once-popular IP struggling to make a new imprint. That No Way Home has managed to bring back literally the same characters from its franchise's heyday, from two different canonical timeliness no less, and merge them into a snappy, novel, holistic, and mass-audience-pleasing film is miraculous. In some ways, No Way Home one-ups the logistical achievement of Infinity War, though, to be fair, that film had many, many more plates to juggle and a gargantuan scope to hold together.Despite this achievement of seamless integration, the film's cinematic technique and technical construction are average and uninspired. This is still the MCU (or MCU adjacent) which means there's little time or patience for texture, atmosphere, or clarity to the action. The mise-en-scene is perfunctory, which is expected but still disappointing when contrasted with the emotional weight of its story.The film's most important asset, by far, is the long and deeply established connection to its characters. The viewer's familiarity with the Spider-Man films, all of them, is paramount, because it gives context to the characters' smooth dynamic and fizzed onscreen chemistry. No Way Home utilizes nostalgia and familiarity with more passion and understanding than most films, but the next step must be a unique directorial vision, leeway for future films' central artists. Maybe Sam Raimi will deliver just that with Doctor Strange 2. Here's hoping.All of the film's performances are up to expectations, but there are a few standouts. Marissa Tomei and Tom Holland carry their weight, Alfred Molina is warm and cold in the right moments, and Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield have unexpectedly masterful chemistry with each other and Holland, both comedically and emotionally.The greatest joy of the film, however, is Willem Dafoe, who reprises his role as The Green Goblin with unbridled gusto. He is totally unhinged, gleefully maniacal, and altogether one the most menacing villains in superhero film history. How he's kept such an edge at sixty-six years of age is an absolute marvel, and it is a fantastic joy to watch.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a highly entertaining and satisfactorily fresh popcorn flick. It almost transcends its comic book origins, though its loyalty to the Marvel filmmaking mode hamstrings its aspirations for the upper echelon of action cinema. Those aspirations are basically irrelevant though; No Way Home has shattered pandemic-era box office numbers and is among the highest grossing films ever, only a few weeks into its release. It will most likely be heralded as one of the greatest MCU films ever and one of the greatest superhero films of all time. If by some remote chance you haven't already seen it, you should. It's great fun all around.", "This movie is such as dream for a Spiderman fan": "This is a movie that delivers more than your expectations.

The theatre experience - our audience started cheering when Andrew Garfield showed up, then absolutely lost our minds when Toby came on screen.Extreme Nitpicks (and the reason why this is not a a 10) - didnt care for the whole Spiderman learning the mirror dimension in 5 seconds, and trapping one of the most powerful people in there. Aunt May did NOT need to die. And the bad guys couldve just been bad the whole time then saved at the end. Rather than bad, then pretend to be good, then bad, then good again. But it did let Jaime Fox provide some brilliant lines. But like i said, these are EXTEME nitpicks.As for the \"pros\" there are too many. Friggin Andrew Garfields acting chops is one of the best in our day. Toby's on-screen presence felt as comforting as Steve from Blue's Clues. LOL. Great movie!", "Another Marvel satisfier": "For the people who believed that Marvel wouldn't exist after endgame, this movie is a spectacular reply for those.

Spider-Man No Way home is a blast to watch proving Marvel is greater than DCEU when making films.", "Yes, it absolutely delivers what you want to see!": "Phase 4 hasn't got off to the best of starts. Far from home suffered from post Endgame fatigue and could never reach the hights of its immediate predecessor.Shang Chi was fun and enjoyable; but they tried to fit 2-3 movies worth of content into a single outing, resulting in ideas that were never explored, too many characters to develop and important pay offs that felt rushed.The Eternals landed to a lukewarm reception that was still probably warmer than it deserved. Generally, it dragged and failed to entertain in more than brief doses.The various TV Series have been extremely mixed in both their overall quality and even the quality of individual episodes.So, the expectations for No Way Home were extremely high...and I was worried that that film hype might be writing cheques that its butt couldn't cash.However I need not have worried. It not only wrote the cheques but they cleared promptly when cashed.There are a few plot holes that it's best not to think about and some of the characters seem to be a bit inconsistent with their motivations and behaviour, but aside from that, it knocks this one out of the park.The script is pretty tight, it's well acted and it delivers the right pacing without any real second act boredom. I'm a heavy smoker and if I make it through a whole film without craving a smoke, its a good film. In this case, not only did the film not give me time to crave one, I genuinely forgot I smoked until I got back to the car afterwards!This film shows that the MCU can still absolutely get the job done when they are working with the right casting, writers and characters.Yes, there were genuine emotional moments and I did find a tear in my eye...but not at the part you would imagine once you've watched it. Yes that was sad but it was a supporting characters moment of redemption that did it for me. Managing to do something that turned out extremely badly last time they attempted it.I'm not crying...you're crying! You will know it when you see it!", "Great cinema experience": "The story goes on immediately after Mysterio reveals Spidermans identity. Before I am going to praise this movie, there is one downnote. The story is pretty simple. Peter messes up (again), and needs to solve it. You'd think that after all these years MCU can come up with some more complex storylines. Not just somebody messing up and fixing it.But, on the other hand, that makes these movies great and enjoyable for everyone. Plus, the story gets depth after Peter messes up. What makes this spiderman great is the character development of Peter Parker. He's always shown as the naive and immature boy in the MCU Universe, but this time he really steps up his game and makes mature choices in the end (sadly enough). And what makes this movie even greater, is the return of all the old spidermans and villains. I was flabbergasted when I was watching. Insane to see all those amazing actors on one screen, gave me Endgame vibes. Ending and postcredit scene is promising for upcoming movies. Overall, one of the best marvel movies I've ever seen. Great work.", "That's what I wanted to see": "The idea of bringing back all the villains from Spider-Man movies was brilliant. Every time I saw a villain from previous movies, there was a smile on my face. Even though I think turning the villains to good characters is kind of pointless, I must admit I enjoyed watching it. With interesting and colorful characters, pretty good special effects and well written plot, I think it leaves me no choice but to give this movie 10/10.", "Fun to Watch however,,,,,,": "You get the impression that the Marvel Comic Studios wish we could all lose our memories so they can make the same movies with the same actors over and over again!Try something more original next time..........", "Wowie Wow Wow": "I wish that I could describe how amazing this was.

At first I wasn't going too because there were rumors whether or not Tobey would be featured plus I haven't seen another solo MCU Spider-Man movie since Homecoming which I thought was a slap in the face to all of us Spidey fans. However, after waiting for that one spoiler confirmation I needed on Tobey, I went in and enjoyed it from start to finishI really enjoyed seeing Tom Holland in this movie and his Spider-Man arc, which I never thought I ever would since I hated his version in Homecoming and those that have seen my review on Homecoming will know all about it. But no, Holland's Spidey really came into his own in this film as he finally dealt with tragedy in his life, the consequences of his actions when it came to nearly destroying reality when Dr. Strange's spell to erase the public's knowledge of him as Spider-Man went wrong and brought in foes from different realities. This was the Spider-Man from Holland I had been waiting to see since I first saw Homecoming. Kudos to Holland, got to give credit where credit is dueAs for bringing in the Raimi villains - Green Goblin, Doc Ock and Sandman along with Amazing Spider- Man villains - Lizard and Electro was great. I had fears Doc Ock and Goblin would be ruined but nope they weren't ruined, they were fantastic. However my only problem is how Doc Ock when telling Holland's Spider Man how he was fighting Tobey's Spider-Man and hated him, when clearly in Spider-Man 2 Doc Ock redeemed himself but just a minor problem that didn't ruin the movie for meWillem Dafoe stole the show in my opinion as Green Goblin. Then again. Would you expected anything different from him? He never missed a beat when coming back into the role messing with Holland's Spider-Man as well as the conflict between Norman and GoblinBut man when it came to seeing Tobey Maguire again as Spider Man i was over the moon, I was so glad he was brought back and wore the Raimi suit again. Him interacting with Garfield and Holland's Spider-Men was honesty the best part about his movie. Those three had really good chemistry.Over all No Way Home was fantastic, it was certainly one of the best MCU movies and Marvel movies I've seen in a long time. Most of the humour was typical forced MCU cringe humour but there were moments when the humour especially between Tobey, Garfield and Holland together was organic and made laugh. Great story, great CGI although I think with Lizard's CGI it could have been a bit better and great use of nostalgia. They didn't bring back the Raimi characters and Amazing Spider-Man characters for cheap fan service. No. There was actual thought that went into bringing them back and fitting in the story.", "It was good, but not great": "I was very hyped to see this movie. The first Tom Holland Spiderman movie is one of my favorite. Seeing all the great reviews, my expectations were sky high. Unfortunately, it was a bit of a let down. I still liked the movie, but I feel that it is a little bit overrated. I felt like some decisions made during the movie made no sense. For an example, Dr Strange is pretty dumb in the movie and he does not look like is usual self. I just feel like the movie lacked some realism (yes I know it is a superhero film after all). I could believe in the first Spider-Man movie, but I did not have that feeling for this one.", "Darn good, but...": "When this movie hits, it hits hard. Overall, very enjoyable, and I think it was better than Far From Home, but Homecoming is still my favorite. Holland is great. Zendaya (sp?) is meh. I now really want a Wong/Ned movie. But I think it dragged a bunch and the storyline relied too much on the surprises and not enough on originality. And I miss Steve Rogers and Tony Stark.", "Good Plot, Action; Terrible Dialogue": "Maybe I'm just getting old, but after reading the comic book and watching the tv cartoon series since the 70's, I found much of this film to be somewhat cringe-worthy in the dialogue department. The plot and basic execution was decent enough, as were the action sequences, but I think this film needs a serious editing job to remove much of the hyper-caffeinated neurotic 'comedy' blather. I guess with Disnee at the helm, the days of darker storytelling are over, and everything has to be 'light' and 'springy'.Although not perfect, Sam Raimi's original trilogy found a decent balance between the light and dark, as did the next two 'Amazing Spider-Man' films, but I really feel the newer ones (especially the latest) are too full of slapdash comedy that offsets the darker and cooler undertones of the film and creates a kind of schizophrenic awkward storytelling. Maybe I'm just old and humorless.", "Full of Surprises but the adversaries lacked the punch": "It was an exhibition of surprises and emotionally catapulting moments. The enemies were just too predictable and bland. Spidey didn't have to do a lot except get up and nail them with ease. The show stealer was Dr. Strange as everything revolves around his doing and his wit was sharpened. Overall a fun but make sure you watch it in 3D.", "Not worth the cinema visit": "For me, the movie was boring and very childish. 30% people left the movie, I stayed till end, was not worth the Sunday. The movie is very long too. Dont recommend.", "The PERFECT movie going experience !!!": "This is the perfect end to Tom's Spiderman trilogy before his version of the web-slinger goes on to become the hero that we all know and love.It is fast paced, engaging and there is not a single dull moment in the entire runtime. So many moments to experience, enjoy and scream in sheer joy !This is one of those movies which deserves an IMAX 3D experience and every penny is worth it (trust me).It hits all the right notes when it comes to the portrayal of the characters from the other universes. The interaction, action sequences and emotional moments among the 3 spidermen were so well written and this is something I never thought I would get to watch on the big screen.This movie solidifies the fact that Andrew Garfield is one of the best incarnations of this character and deserves more screen time and movies. The scene where he saves MJ is emotional, heroic and gives a good closure to his guilt of not being able to save Gwen in Amazing Spiderman 2.Tobey helps inspire Tom to do the right thing and be the bigger person because that's what Spiderman is (in any universe).Just go to the movies, grab a popcorn and experience this !!", "Never heard a cinema react like that in my life": "WARNING SPOILERS\nHonestly the crowd when Andrew and Tobey appeared and at the ending after watching the credits was incredible. They clapped and cheered so loud it was amazing. This movies was both incredible and the most heart breaking thing I've ever seen in my life.", "The best Marvel movie so far": "You know that peculiar feeling, when you first experience something truly special? Seeing a dress by Alexander McQueen, or hearing Diana Ankudinova sing?Well, this movie has it too. A lot of talented people put their soul into it.. and it shines.Story is congruent and makes sense, characters are deep and true. Actors nail it. Just nail it. God bless Tom Holland!It could have been a 10, but a bit of \"woke\" agenda inevitably got to it too.Watch it.", "\"A Visual \u2728 and Emotional \ud83d\ude2d treat for Peter Parker aka Spiderman Fans\"": "The movie will definitely come up with your expectations. Kudos to Tom Holland he did his best for the role of Peter Parker. A Peter Parker fan will definitely Cry at the end of the movie or at some point in the movie. The action sequences and Web Swinging is far better than previous home series movies. The VFX team has worked very hard. Willem Dafoe was looking so great on his come back in the role of the green goblin, he was shining different among the other cast.", "The Perfect Fan Service": "To be honest, I thought at first that the idea of bringing in characters from past franchises is a bit much on paper and in the context of the plot where Peter's identity is revealed is I think, unnecessary? I doubted the idea at first, but after watching the film, damn. The way this film is executed is too good to be true.The whole team behind this film, especially the writers, did a really amazing job in finding out a way to integrate past films into this piece of cinematic masterpiece. From the nostalgic moments and musical cues, down to the littlest mannerisms of the characters that will make every Spider-Man fan tear up in joy and nostalgia.Not to mention Dir. Jon Watts nailing the direction and the vision of this film. I love the pacing of this film especially in the first act. This film is probably the most emotional MCU, if not, Marvel film. Tom Holland did a really great job in his performance and he really showed the range of his acting capabilities. Special shoutout to Willem Dafoe who really stole the show whenever he's on screen.Overall, this film is so entertaining, so emotional, so nostalgic, and so epic. My only complain for now ('cause I've only watched it once) are the loose ends that probably will be answered in future MCU films. Other than that, Spider-Man: No Way Home is one of the best, if not, THE BEST MCU film (maybe a bit biased because Spider-Man is my childhood) yet in my opinion. Definitely watch it for the first time in the theater with full of crowds who will cheer, laugh, an/or cry with you throughout the film if there is still a chance.", "Nearly fell asleep": "It's one of those movies you shouldn't think about, or else you'd pull it apart. There's alot of blanks in the movies where nothing happens. The storyline doesn't make sense and characters from the other Spider-Man movies don't appear. Only chosen characters must have agreed I guess.", "Finally the Ultimate Spider-Man Movie": "The most amazing cinema experience of my life! The whole cinema was gasping, crying, cheering and clapping like the moment when Cap caught Thors hammer IN Endgame!Please sign Tom Holland on for 6 more Marvel movies!!!Absolutely enjoyed every moment of this movie, I was front row, and when I turned around to see if any one had stayed for the 2 post credit scenes...\nTHE ENTIRE PACKED CINEMA WAS STILL THERE!Impossible to talk about without spoilers, but if you are a Spider-Man, Marvel, MCU, Avengers or movie fan at all, I guarantee you will not be disappointed,The best cast in an MCU movie outside of the 4 Avengers movies or Cap Civil War!!!", "Don't miss this perfect holiday movie!": "I didn't think the Spiderman movies could get better but this one is the best IMHO. Fast faced, cool villains, surprising plot, great CGI, and lots of humor- this movie will rank with the best of the MCU movies. Loved it, loved it, loved it!! Can't wait to see it again!!!", "Too many special effects": "Too many special effects, a movie is not better just because it has more special effects! Special effects make everything more fake and stupid! Too many jokes that are not funny, it seems to watch parodies with those attempts at humor that go wrong! Sorcerers, spells, all too exaggerated! The S. Raimi movies were much better and I give my 7 just for tobey and the other characters from the Raimi movies. Holland and zendaya aesthetically horrendous couple in the film.", "GOOD, but something missing": "Full of joy dont get me wrong, but felt this movie was scrappy, all over the place. Was like a comedy\ud83d\ude44 really enjoyed tom Holland in this though, proper smashed it\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "Pure fan-service...not much else": "There's not much to this unless you are a huge fan of Spider-Man...it's two and a half hours of references to other Spider-Man movies, but unless you have a nostalgic connection to them, there's nothing really interesting going on here.The plot, such as it is, is just an excuse to have the different Spider-Mans and old villains interacting. I'm sure it's all very entertaining to some people...but not for me.The Big Emotional Ending felt contrived; it wasn't clear to me why it needed to happen or how it was even possible.So if the above sounds like fun, this is the movie for you. Not so much for casual MCU fans.", "SPIDER-MEN SAVE THE DAY": "Wow. If you, like me, are a lifelong Spider-Man fan and have been following since the first live action movie, this movie is the culmination and payoff of being a fan.The amount of detail, love, and care that were put into every single scene in this movie cannot be understated. The intricately woven backstories, jokes, memes, iconic moments, and fan service is done as masterfully as I have ever scene; with amazing music, cinematography, and thematic elements to pull at your heart strings while you gush with amazement and wonder.Tom is excellent as proven, the return of Tobey, Andrew, and the villains was executed perfectly, with each character having developed and feeling more real than as portrayed when we last saw them.There were cheers, laughs, tears, a wonderful mix of emotions to keep you on the edge of your seats while your jaw hits the floor after each big reveal and big moment. Going to Marvel movies on opening nights are always fun, but this one hit with the crowd (and myself on an Endgame level of magnitude. A 10/10 film and experience I would recommend to every person I know, and for all the huge Spider-Man fans like myself: this is the movie we've all been waiting for. Amazing.", "A Cinematic Masterpiece": "This film really gripped onto your emotions and tossed them about, at one point the entire theatre was clapping and shouting with joy and at other points the theatre was full on sobbing.The shots were also great and detailed and overall it was a great film but it was certainly a emotional rollercoaster ride.", "Very enjoyable but nothing revolutionary that many marvel fans are claiming": "This movie feels like a fans project. A bit predictable and there is no real threat to spiderman but overall a very enjoyable experience. With that being said I don't think this movie is better than infinity war which is arguable the greatest marvel movie of all time All in all a spiderman fan will have a great time watching this movie.", "So much I didn't like": "So! It would never be great for me as growing up I didn't like the DR Strange comics and found him rather boring! The live adaptation of him are spot on.... Sandman, Electro and the Lizard are all forgettable and dont do the Sinister 6 from the graphic novels any justice at all and the other 2 thrown in characters ( the ones in the red and blue ) was very underwhelming in all of their scenes.It's a real shame as I personally thought the last Spiderman film was genius ( Bravo Mysterio )", "OMG!!!! MIND BLOWING!!!! FANTASTIC": "Being a marvel and spider man fab i really enjoyed the movie i have no words you are gone enjoy the movie at all best spider man movie ever made really really loved and ya at all tobey and andrew are in this movie what you demands for the movie is giving you have the expectations very high and it will be fulfilled just amazing superrrrrr.", "Entertaining in Parts": "This storyline is so thoughtless, Aunt May essentially dies because Spider-Man's friends didn't get into college. Dr Strange, and the whole multi universe is a joke at this point, utilised only to coincidentally switch the storyline. It was cool in, 'Into the Spider-Verse', but now it's so boring and played out. The movie is entertaining in parts and if you want nostalgia you'll enjoy the appearance of Toby Maguire and co.", "Supervillains aren't for fixing..": "Sorry but I disagree with most of you lauding over this film.It's everything that's wrong with the 'fix it' society we live in. Super heroes need super villains - super villains do super crimes, they plan to bring about the end of the earth. These crimes aren't meant to be resolved by stopping the SV and sending them to therapy and to clean litter off the highway whilst they repay their debt to society. Nor are they meant to end up working in the fresh food department of John Lewis whilst maintaining a lovely front lawn in their two bed semi.What's wrong with the format - why cant the SH stop the SV and kill or eradicate them? Who actually thinks a SV could just knock it on the head and go back to a mundane life?Why did the Amazing Spider-Man have to turn into the Average Spider-Man (aka emotional wreck Spider-Man), but I suppose you all needed to see Spider-Mans emotional side. Was it meant to make him more human seeing him crying his eyes out after saving MJ? Did that make amends for losing Gwen?Toby the wise - Tom the Brave - Andrew the Apprehensive. Really?I felt no pouring out of emotions when Dr Strange made everyone forget Peter Parker, not when he said goodbye nor when he went for his coffee.I wish I'd have gone and seen Bond instead and Dr Strange made me forget that my first outing to the movies, after two years of lockdown, was to see this bilge.Decent film I suppose - entertain me, stop trying to train me to join your fix/cancel culture.", "Wow amazing movie but the ending.": "This is my second favourite Marvel movie after Endgame but the ending was emotional and shocking. I didn't expect Tom Holland's character but I was wrong and that's the only thing that made me a bit unhappy.Still it's a 10/10 movie. The visuals and cgi were great. Tom, Benedict, William, and John all did some great acting. Tobey and Garfield were also excellent. I hope the fourth movie is different and that everyone will remember Peter parker( Tom Holland) once again.", "Im shoked left the theatere 20 minutes before the end": "The story is super stupied.Didnt lough once\nYou cant be geek ans hero and also tom holand the real life acrobat.The directing is kiddy show and the vilans looked so old like they had to drink 10 coffee cups just to fart at the morning.When toby showed up i felt so sorry one how stupied he thinkgs this movie us u just left 20 minutes before the show.I left when toby showed up and looked like this was the last place he wanted to be.", "Omg this movie great": "Love this flim. I think it will be the last Marvel movie that hits Spiderman into a next level . Expecting more this type of flims will be come in future.", "I loved this": "Holy crap fav film of the mcu I saw this at 11am and absolutely loved this I loved the fights story character just atcion and drama with many sad scenes one jumpscare packed film with goblin doc lizard every bad guy ever I loved the post credits can't wait for multimaddness hope u guys like this 10/10. P.s wasn't expecting Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield in this holy crap good teaming hope u guys enjoy.", "Awkwardness everywhere,": "I could make a list of every scene I found awkward but my goal is only to see if others agree with me.And I need 150 characters which is way to much for me.", "One of the best Spiderman movies": "It is full of worth it movie. Everyone should go watch it at theaters. Graphics are super amazing. Writing,directing,acting,etc. Are super amazing\n#nospoilers.", "Spiderman athis best?": "Considering the struggles that many, MANY, movies has faced in the last years due to rising politicitation this is the mostly odd exception.We get spiderman, Dr Strange (who I have the most hopes up for) so what could go wrong?Not much really. We get an action movie without the SJW and intersectional politics blended in (mostly). The three cooperating Spidermen make it for a great outing.Just enjoy this gem for what it is. I will be surprised if you get something as clean as this in years to come. And when I say clean, I mean clean of politics and other ism's.", "Not as good as people say": "This movie is more for an enjoyable time at the cinema or at home. It does not continue the MCU timeline very much but repeats it. Halfway through the movie I fell asleep because of how bad the plot was. The movie did not make any sense at all.The performance from Tobey and Andrew were awful. They changed the character if Spiderman from the original movie.The villians in the movie were much weaker from the original films again. It was revealed that Doc Ock was not evil but the machine made him that way.Overall the movie is worth to watch in the cinema as almost everyone has watched it. This movie was not good but people love it because of the two spiderman.", "Enjoyable but underwhelming": "Enjoyable movie, however, the loads of fan service and plot holes kept taking me out of the movie. The directing was good, for a Marvel movie, which makes it pretty ok. Definitely worth a watch anyways if you've already seen all the other Spider-Man movies.", "Not worth watching and rating high": "12-year-olds or less may like it, but combining the characters of Spider-Man and the difference in his personality in more than one part was a mistake, I do not recommend watching it, as it lacks fun compared to the previous parts and it seems that the director is confused between the characters of Spider-Man, really disappointing aspirations.", "It's quite a good movie": "I'm not a big Marvel movies fan, but I must recognize the effort put in this production, there were great CGIs, great actors and a good writing. There are some writing problems here or there, but nothing really terrible. If you are a spiderman fan you will surely love this movie, and even if you are not, like me, watch it, it will be a good experience.", "This is the BEST spiderman movie of ALL time.": "Stop reading comments, going to YouTube or even Twitter. Just watch the movie with the full experience without getting any spoilers. You'll love it. It's a solid THREE out of 5. What a movie. It's the perfect conclusion in many ways.", "Is this Spider-Man or postman pat!": "Through a series of calamitous events Spider-Man summons all his old enemies because his friends didn't get into their favourite college. Then, like a new age Christian on steroids, he tries to save his enemies who want to kill him, despite repeatedly being offered a way to deal with them quickly and bring this too long film to an end. Unfortunately Spider-Man is completely inept at trying to save his enemies, to a level I have only seen surpassed by postman pat trying to deliver a package. It is monumental. This then results in his aunt dying and his friends forgetting him. For which I have zero sympathy. What a ball ache all because you didn't get your preferred uni. I wouldn't tolerate this stupidity in my 4 year old, let alone the Avengers.", "A love letter to spiderman and fans": "Try to watch it in theatre or at least a screen as big as you can find.Spoilers:\nSony and Marvel somehow managed to give a great movie. It had great Easter eggs(loved the swinging near transformers), great story, great character building, great visual and great message. They managed to recreate marvel and sony movie plot while also keeping it nostalgic. They also gave a good send off to great number of actors which is what good companies do. I had a great time. Thank you!", "The Worst Marvel Movie Ever.": "I still cannot understand people saying this movie is a good movie, let alone a masterpiece. \"Childish script, the petty effort to make Tom Holland who I think is a brilliant actor an icon, turning Dr. Strange into an amateur wizard as if he's a Hogwarts freshman\" costed me 3 long and boring hours of my life. I'm not sure if I'll ever see another spider man movie of Tom Holland again.", "Definitely not more than that...": "Rating score needs to be recalculated.If you put 9 or 8 over 10 for masterpieces like shawshank, return of the king, and the godfather\nIt would be generous to give this title a 6!Or give a scoring dedicated to marvel movies only, only then an 8 would make sense..", "Best Spidey movie ever": "Must watch movie , one of the best movie I have watched. It is 8th spiderman movie and the workdone by marvel and Sony is another level. Experience it in cinema .The end credit scene is also so lit.", "I LOVED Spider-Man: No Way Home.": "For me, this movie works for 3 reasons:*1 - THE ACCURACY OF THE COMICS*The other versions of the villains that appear in this movie have been adapted to sound better in their own movies. While some had better adaptations, like Doc Ock, others weren't so lucky, like Electro. Now in this movie, they decided to change their versions that were already established in previous movies, and it worked. Green Goblin got a new outfit and is more psychopathic and more manipulative than 2002's Spider-Man. Electro is no longer a blue puppet and has gained a more physical form and more similar to its comic book version. The other villains kept the shape of their previous films, but worked a little more better on the CGI.*2 - NOSTALGIA*It's no surprise that everyone was born and raised with Spider-Man, whether it's Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield. But let's face it, they didn't have a 100% dignified ending to the work they gave the character, as seen in Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man 2. So, with the return of these two in this movie, we feel the passion that we felt a long time ago. We feel that this time around, they had a dignified ending, both for Andrew, who replayed his most beloved and cherished childhood super-hero, and for Tobey, who got the chance to close his arc the way he wanted and loved in Spider-Man 3. There is no doubt that Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, Alfred Molina, Willem Dafoe, Jamie Foxx, Rhys Ifans, Thomas Haden Church, J. K. Simmons and Charlie Cox had fun and loved to reprise their roles of great characters who are loved and revered to this day.*3 - TOM HOLLAND'S ARC AS SPIDERMAN*I'll be honest, I never liked this Spider-Man being treated like Iron Man Jr. For the script and direction. It seems that in the two previous films, Peter Parker never learned great responsibility, never learned to walk his own path, never learned what it is to be Spider-Man. But now, I'm proud to say that it didn't happen in this movie. Finally I felt that this Peter Parker has finally matured into a hero, after dealing with the loss of Aunt May, the weight of the villains and the teachings of the other Spideys.Tom Holland delivered a divine performance and redeemed himself after two films.Peter Parker of the MCU has finally learned that consequences weigh on his life and that with great powers comes great responsibilities. From this unique experience I've had, I'm proud of this new Peter and excited about his future at Marvel.~I love you guys.-Andrew Garfield~Thank you.-Tobey Maguire and Tom Holland.", "EPIC...": "One of the best Spiderman movie from \"MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE\". It is also a \"TRIBUTE\" to all\nSpiderman lovers and fan's. I also get the best theatre experience. ...\nMARVEL made an excellent story ...\nI Love this movie...\nNB: MUST WATCH MOVIE'...\nBETTER TO WATCH IN THEATRE....", "The Good, Bad and the Ugly": "Good: Seeing all the modern-era Spider-Man's on the screen at the same time was very cool. Seriously.Bad: The era of CGI has made these movies so unrealistic and unbelievable that they're really not movies. They're animation with live film overlays.Ugly: Jamie Foxx is one of my favorites. A super talented guy. From In Living Colour to Music to Movies, he's a generational talent. But 'cmon man, really? A woke call out in the script for a \"black\" Spider-Man? Lame, pathetic and insulting.", "Spider-Man: Endgame": "Yeah, maybe a 10 is a fanboy rate. I am a Spider-Man fanboy, 100%. But you know, I was over hyped and this movie went beyond my expectations. I laughed, I cried, the entire room clapped at many specific moments...Let's put this straight. The trilogy of Raimi brought the Spider-Man I liked the most until Spider-Man 3 came out, and that was the big mistake in my opinion. TAS wasn't perfect but it was enjoyable. The second part was okay.Holland? Well. I believe Homecoming and FFH are enjoyable but imperfect. Homecoming was born under the shadow of the Avengers. FFH was about becoming a better Aventer and leave the shadow of Iron Man. I didn't really see a strong Spider-Man feeling in those movies even though they're entertaining and Holland does a great character.But NWH brings him as the Spider-Man he's supposed to be. He's definitely Spider-Man. He's definitely Peter. May is definitely aunt May beyond what you could imagine. Strange is cool but he doesn't steal the show like Stark did in the first one, and that's good because, you know, it's not his movie. But he does his job, oh yeah. He does it.Oh, and the villains. This is, in my humble opinion, the first Spider-Man movie that doesn't screw up bringing many villains together- it's the opposite actually, it's amazing. You have to see it with your own eyes. This movie is everything any Spider-Man fan deserves, no matter your gender, nationality or toothpaste.Oh, and wait until the very end. The mid-credits scene is good, but what's waiting for you at the end of the last credits is gonna blow your mind.", "Fabulous Achievement For MCU": "Ending a trilogy is typically a monumental task, but what No Way Home accomplished is nothing short of miraculous. What they kept from audiences successfully, the technical feat, the story they put together and most of all the brilliant performances, should be commended for years to come. It's hard to argue with people that this is the best Spider-Man film to date. I still need more time. All I'll say is, 2021 is the most consistently great year Marvel has ever had and we should never doubt their ability ever again.9.5/10.", "Unreal experience, nostalgia": "Loved every scene of the movie , especially in some scenes I don't know why Iam screaming out loud .

Toby and Garfield's entrance is CG and the sandman effects are off the mark.Plot more powerless to ridicule, the overall performance is this version of spider-man has no ideas, no responsibility.", "Watch it if and only if you yearn for fan service": "This movie is for fan service lovers and don't expect too much in story and screenplay. Looks like Marvel wanted to have a multiverse ending and Sony wanted to have a reboot-ish ending and both companies did not care about the writing process in between. The third act was the only area where the writing was solid and were backed many wholesome moments (though some were forgettable). Definitely not the best Spidey movie out there but I can guarantee that this is a leap in the entire live action Spidey franchise movies.

The building where happy lives is not reinforced with steel bars, the slab just breaks from 1 floor to another and I see no steel. I get it the suit protects spiderman but his head was without the mask and still no injury to the skull after so many hits from hitting the floor its just bad direction. 75% of the film was dumb.

Though that isn't a problem, it became a problem when this started taking over storytelling to allow for a small chuckle that caters to the lowest common denominator audience. The disappointment on my face when I heard the audience chuckle at every stupid joke was cringeworthy.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie and if I were to look at this as casual I would be satisfied. But the characters were poorly written, the plot was undermining and the climax was anti-climatic. Everything felt meaningless and it was just a mess of an ending. The reveals for the villains gave me chills especially Doc Ock and the Green goblin. But to see Doc Ock's character treated like that was infuriating. My biggest frustration with this movie is the fact that Spider-Man chose to 'save' these villains (putting everyone's lives at risk) for what reason? Because he's so good inside? This motivation is weak and frustratingly illogical. The whole thing about Tom Holland wanting to 'fix' the villains was so infuriating. Though the scene where Aunt May died was easily my favourite of the movie. Even though I felt nothing (I'm not too fond of whimsical poorly written characters that are not interesting.) The fact that Tom Holland lost something dear to him because of his choice to 'fix' the villains was actually satisfying because it gave weight to his actions.Then the reveal of the previous Spider-man was so lackluster and came out of nowhere. And the fact that they had to take away from Dr Strange's character to even allow for this mess of a story is disappointing. The audience is screaming and clapping while I'm simply amused by the fact that the writers couldn't think of a better way to introduce these iconic characters. Not to mention the scenes where the characters are confused because all three Peter Parker's are in presence is disappointing. Give me a break MCU.Overall, Spider-man: No Way Home is a mess. Interesting concept but executed poorly. A missed opportunity.", "Cheesy and awful": "I think I must be missing something. The story is bizarre, it doesn't feel like a spiderman storyline, it's really bad. The acting feels like a teenage drama school. The bad characters are all a bit comical. The cgi is the only real impressive bit. I'm not sure who decided this film was a good idea has really missed the mark.A real disappointment. I've not really been a fan of any of the recent marvel movies, but I think this could be worst of the lot.", "Truly incredible": "Spider-Man: No Way Home, delivers not just on people's expectations but exceeding them too.

It's an unforgettable film and will change the future of marvel and films forever 10/10.", "Ackward": "Let me start by saying that by no means Spiderman NWH is a bad movie. It is however a pretty weird one.Potential spoilers ahead (character/actors' wise)While the idea of getting together most of the villains and all of the spidermen from the past 20 years sounds exciting, it is a bit unnerving. Here we have a movie with a pretty teen vibe to it (which I guess it's okay since our hero is just past teens) but to comprehend the movie one needs to have watched all the previous ones (the first one dating from 2002). So it kind of aims two targets and misses them both - the teen and young adolescents will probably not have heard of the previous movies (pre-MCU Spiderman), the mid 30's and above will not enjoy the over-teen vibe on screen.Also, some of the actors have aged visibly (again, normal and expected) but they are completely misfit for a spiderman role. Guess the make up team should've tried more to approximate their look.Surprisingly, not all acting was top notch, and some scenes dragged a little (it is a long movie, cuts could have been made).Overall, brave attempt of Marvel to scratch the multiverse albeit a weird one. Nonetheless, deserving of a watch.P.s. Excited what the mid-credits scene brings.", "Great comeback": "Amazing movie, good effects, nice sound quality. Amazing! I rate it 10/10, brings good memories from a way back. Still need 150 characters...and i love my girlfriend.", "Best movie of the year!": "I loved every second! Really funny, brilliantly acted, one of the best mcu films, best Spider-Man film with fantastic shocks with a great post-credit surprise and an especially great performance as always from Willem Defoe as the famous green goblin.", "Mediocre Marvel/Superhero movie, worse considering the money invested": "The overall idea of the multiverse and bringing together generations of Spider-man is brilliant, but there's an obvious lack of brainpower to flesh it out.The movie starts off pretty slowly and goes on for a long time. I was not having a good feeling.The movie went off the rails when Dr. Strange did the amnesia spell. No one's motivations really made any sense, from the villains to Spider-Man x 3. There were no interesting stakes and the multiverse theory had so many holes I couldn't get invested in any of it. Why don't Andrew Garfield and Toby McGuire want to get back to their universes immediately? Aren't they worried about what's happening there in their absence? Nope, they're fine to just hang out in this universe for however long the movie needs. Why are the super villains coming to this Spider-Man, in this universe and not any one of the infinite other universes? Why doesn't the amnesia spell traverse the multiverse, yet people can traverse it?The movie consists of three basic parts, jumbled together: a lot of standing around with stupid dialogue and \"humor\" (the scene with obese kid's mom and the cobwebs), and action scenes and \"emotional scenes\" that don't connect. For example, Marisa Tomei is terrible; she doesn't exude wisdom or any genuine soul or emotion. Another example of the stupidity is the climax, where Dr. Strange is holding the portals closed (?) so other super villains can't get through, and tells Holland to say his goodbyes before the next amnesia spell. Well, Spider-Man takes his sweet time saying goodbye. There was never any real tension, nothing at stake, nothing made any sense.I'm not a fan of Tom Holland, Zendaya, or the obese kid-their conversations, personalities, looks, and chemistry are just boring. There are no sparks between Holland and Zendaya (they're a real life couple?)-those two actors are not good actors, in my opinion. Andrew Garfield and Toby McGuire are very good, although their direction and lines are overly sappy-their acting and stories are enough to carry the emotional beats, if they were given more restrained lines and physical reactions.Considering all the money and the talent that can buy, this was weakly executed. 6/10 is fair.", "Monotonous": "I honestly did not care for this film. Was cool to see the villains and the other two Spider-Man from the older films altogether, that's about it. The post-credit scenes I thought were more exciting than the whole movie.", "Probably the most fun movie I've ever watched.": "If you are looking for fun, this is the movie for you. I may write a more detailed review after a few watches, but this is one of those rare moments where something lives up to the hype. Despite the leaks and people figuring out the \"big secret\", it was just as exciting when Andrew and Toby came in. I'm so glad it wasn't just a quick cameo but was truely an ensemble. I cannot think of a single actor who didn't carry their weight. Very well made movie. With the abrupt end of the past two franchises, this movie brought a much needed closure to those while being a ton of fun.", "Spider-Man: No Way Home (review)": "This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman. I loved every second of it!", "Absolutely spectacular": "As difficult as it must've been to incorporate so many characters, they did it seemlessy. It was jack packed with action, comedy and even heart ache. After multiple bad marvel projects, I hope this is a sign that they're back. This has given me hope!", "6 and I'm generous": "Movie was absolutely for little kids, with a nonsense plot and Strange that do everything Peter told him to do in a crazy manner destabilizing the multiverse. There's no way someone like Strange could do this.Anyway that's a 6 for the graphic and because I liked to see Maguire again, nothing elss to be honest.", "Just full of absurd and childish logic": "I have to say out of all the movies that I saw this year, this one dissapointed me the most based on all the hype and positive messages I have seen.One of the first scenes, the one with the spell - is just so utterly ridiculous that I can't wrap my brain around it. Brilliant student, almost genius like, who with his friends were trying to get to top US tech university and a bloody neurosurgeon who has become one of the most powerful mages, are acting as they were 5 years old, with absolutely no concepts of communication, thought process, critical thinking. They just got instantly dumb, and since everything starts from such a stupid scene - the whole movie feels like it.Not to mention that if someone has watched previous movies about the spider, also knows that basically his whole main mission in the movie, the ones he sacrifices almost everything for, is almost entirely pointless. Which makes the movie even more dumb.And to just hammer the nail into the coffin, if the type of conversation from the final scenes happened at the beginning - THE WHOLE MOVIE WOULD NEVER EXIST...Sure, the audio is great, the visual are great, the jokes are funny and actors are amazing. But I cannot overlook the fact of how illogical and pointless the plot for this movie is.6/10 is amazingly high as far as I'm concerned.Watch the movie if you want to know the MCU story, but don't expect to be blown away. I'm just sad.", "A Trilogy Finale": "No Way home is the final installment of this \"Home\" trilogy. There's a lot in this film. It's packed. Sometimes I wish the scenes themselves were longer. The pace was very snappy. But for 2 hr 30min this film was great. Tom Holland earns his place as the webslinger. This film is an experience. It's A Spider Man fan's fever dream come true.", "Great Movie Overall": "I know the first 35 minutes were boring but this was meant to build up tension and that worked and made a great film by marvel. The film may be dark to most people and that kind of took over the main storyline but it's still a great film.", "A perfect event": "I don't even know what to say, that was such a roller coaster, I went high and with my best friends and oh man it was just such a beautiful experience, we cried a lot, laughed a lot and we were almost hugging because of all the excitement.Honestly, to me this movie was perfect, my friends and i all agree that it is everything we wanted and an event we'll never forget.How I love movies man.", "Up to the mark.": "Brilliant acting. Cinematography. Writing. Execution.Felt nostalgic while watching entire movie.Entire theatre was roaring.That's how Marvel defeat DC.", "Best Spider-Man movie to date.": "Morality is inseparable part of who really Peter is. Realizing great power => great responsibility, not just knowing it, is the inevitable fate for him. Loved every moral choice he faced.Great expansion of \"just one bad day\" theory too.", "I LOVED IT!!!!!": "Amazing, fantastic, cool, and just wow. The nostalgia and just everything...it made me soooooooo happy seeing Andrew and Tobey again...honestly...there were also some very sad parts... I just really enjoyed it. Saw this just today...it was the first day of release. Go and see it if you haven't yet.", "The Ultimate Fan Service Film": "Reviewing this film is difficult for me. From a critical point of view, I can see that the film has several shortcomings. The action is flat, feeling weightless at times due to its CGI-heavy visuals, and if you attempted to dissect the plot too much, the whole thing would fall apart. Yet despite this, I loved this movie. It was pure fan service in the best way possible. It gave you a colossal mash-up of beloved characters from three separate Spider-Man franchises and managed to make it exciting, funny and emotional.One of my big criticisms of the previous two Tom Holland Spider-Man movies was director Jon Watt's lacklustre visual style. While he brought plenty of heart and humour to the characters, the films looked bland. The way this film begins, it feels like it is directed by somebody entirely new to the franchise. It has tremendous energy, from the GoPro-style shot of Peter and MJ swinging through the city to the one-shot, long take in Peter's apartment, all playing out to the brilliant \"I Zimbra\" by Talking Heads. After this opening, however, the film falls back into the same generic style as the first two films, with a few flourishes here and there, such as the portrayal of Peter's spider-sense in Happy's apartment.The CGI throughout the film is serviceable, but No Way Home is certainly overly reliant on digital effects. I found this most apparent in the highway action scene where we are introduced to Doc Ock. The last time we saw this character was in 2004 when puppeteers operated his metallic tentacles. However, it is all CGI here and doesn't have the same impact.Nevertheless, the film moves at such a breakneck speed that it never allows you to think about any one element for too long. The film's first-hour deals with the introduction (or reintroduction) of the film's five villains, all from different Spider-Man universes. Green Goblin, Doc Ock and Sandman from Sam Raimi's Spider-Man Trilogy and Lizard and Electro from Marc Webb's Amazing Spider-Man films. The film wisely chooses to give the most attention to Green Goblin and Doc Ock while reinventing Electro after his lacklustre portrayal in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Lizard and Sandman get little to do, but I was okay with this decision due to the enormous array of characters. My main issue was the character motivations for Sandman. He switches between good and evil throughout, and his reasons are vague at best.As the film progresses, Green Goblin becomes the primary villain, and I thought this was a brilliant move. Willem Dafoe returns to his iconic role 20 years later and gives a brilliantly committed performance. He could have easily taken the money and phoned it in, yet he doesn't do that. He gives a performance that not only matches his original but actually tops it.But instead of simply throwing lots of different characters together as a form of cheap fan service, this movie also has lots of heart and genuine emotion. While the first hour does feel very light and breezy, the film catches us off guard with the death of Marisa Tomei's Aunt May. One of my most significant issues with the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies was their complete lack of origin story. And while I felt they were right at the time not to spend an entire film doing his origin story again, as we'd seen it all before with Tobey and Andrew's Spider-Men, I felt that not even acknowledging Uncle Ben was a mistake. Here, however, they retroactively fix that issue beautifully. Instead of Uncle Ben dying in this universe, it is Aunt May who dies and utters the famous words, \"with great power comes great responsibly\". As she said these words, it became clear that the Tom Holland trilogy of films had all been one big origin story, and the reason the previous movies didn't feel like \"classic Spider-Man\" was that he wasn't quite there yet. The fact that May had been in multiple films made her death much more impactful than the previous Uncle Ben deaths, which came early in both Tobey and Andrew's first films.May's death is the turning point for the film. From here, we get two of the most incredible surprise appearances I've ever seen in a movie. Both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield show up, playing their respective versions of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Their appearances were hidden entirely from the movie's marketing, and everyone involved categorically stated that they were not involved in the project. Yet, everyone was anticipating that they would show up, and when they finally arrive, it is joyous. It is such a bizarre concept, yet the interplay between the three Spider-Men was brilliant, discussing and joking about their similarities and differences. Although I suspected they might turn up, I did not expect them to have such substantial supporting roles with their own character arcs. And while Tobey is great, and he was the one I was anticipating the most, it is Andrew Garfield who steals the show. He brings such liveliness and enthusiasm to the performance and gets a beautiful moment of redemption for his failure to save Gwen in his last appearance as the character. Watching the moment when they finally appeared on opening night in a packed cinema was one of my greatest cinema moments. The crowd's excitement and joy were infectious.It was also great to see J. K. Simmons return as J. Jonah Jameson. While he had a brief appearance in the post-credit scene for Far From Home, we get a lot more of him here. While I don't think he is quite as funny or chaotic as he was in the Sam Raimi Trilogy, I still really enjoyed his performance. It is also clear that he is not playing the same JJJ from previous movies but an MCU variant instead. Here, he is portrayed more like an Alex Jones-type conspiracy theory podcaster.Doctor Strange is also part of this movie and is the catalyst for all the crazy multiverse events that occur. Benedict Cumberbatch is excellent as ever in the role. Yet, I'm happy that they managed to find a way to sideline him for a majority of the movie, as I enjoyed the focus on Spider-Man and his rogue's gallery.Despite all the bonkers, multiverse characters and action that crowd this film, the relationship between Peter, MJ, and Ned is at its heart. And because of this, the ending has real emotional consequences. We do feel that Peter has learned that with great power comes great responsibility. And in the final shots, as he swings through a snowy New York, it finally feels like he has truly become Spider-Man.", "I'm not a big Spider-Man fan but...": "I thought this movie was great. Every single complex idea that was brought into this film was pulled off to near perfection by the writers and director. The movie has a similar vibe to the previous films in the Tom Holland series but there are several very emotional moments. Every character was interesting and some were arguably more interesting than the previous installment they were in. The other spidermen were brought in the film with ease. Everything came full circle with the iconic line \"with great power comes great responsibility\" While I'm not sure if the memory erasing ending completely made sense, the concluding scenes were pretty satisfying, leaving plenty of room for sequels if they want Peter (Tom Holland) to reunite with MJ and Ned. I love Marvel but Spider-Man has never been my favorite character. This movie made me really appreciate each generation of the character. A lot of that is because of Tom Holland's excellent performance and the spidermen trio's great chemistry. I give this movie a strong 8.5...and I can't wait to see Peter Parker's story continue.", "One of the worst films in 2021": "2.5 hours of life wasted. In my ranking of the worst films of this year, I have an undoubted favorite. For the first time in my life, I wanted to get up and leave the cinema after the first 30 minutes of watching...In this film, the whole plot can fit in 1.5 hours of time, an hour of which is fan service and references to old Spider-Man films. The rest of the time is boring, empty dialogues, long glances of the characters, long and worthless scenes that do not carry a special semantic load.Unlike the old universes, Holland's character is distinguished by incredible stupidity, selfishness, some completely illogical, and in some places frankly absurd and dangerous actions. This Peter Parker does not think at all about the consequences of his actions, he frankly does not care about the opinion of his senior comrades, and the fact that people are dying because of him is completely indifferent to him. It seems that he never took part in the events of the War of Infinity, as if he did not see the consequences of an overestimated opinion of his own capabilities and an arrogant desire to prove to everyone that you know what is right and best for everyone. Ideally, we should empathize with this character. But apart from irritation and surprise, how can one be so short-sighted and selfish, he does not cause anything.The film is very beautifully shot, you can't take that away from him. A special tick is the appearance of such legends as Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield and others. But alas, even the fantastic talent of these amazing actors, the fullness and uniqueness of their characters does not save the film from the lack of semantic load, stretched, flat content of the plot.It's amazing how, based on such a cool idea, to lure such cool actors, it was possible to make such a bad and 'tasteless' movie. Pure fanservice and nothing more.", "The Greatest Of All Spider-Man Movies": "I went to see this expecting a typical Tom Holland as Spider-Man movie, I came out wishing the next chapter in his story would come out in a week! There was so much going on in this movie but the directors handled the comedy and seriousness well. Although some said the lines were forced I believe this movie was funny for a marvel movie. Although Aunt May dying on screen was something of a shock, and seeing Tom Holland's Peter Parker go on a rampage against Green Goblin was a little scary, the movie was mostly positive. Don't get me wrong those scenes were necessary for the plot, they were just something to behold in a movie trilogy usually so upbeat. Also the pairing up of the Spider-Men was epic. Like I can't see any scenario we're they could have made it better. And the end of it all, Peter (Holland) is just a nobody. Because he chose to be Spider-Man, he chose to give up his life to help others, he gave up his friendships and love life as Peter Parker to be a full time Spider-Man. His down-to-earth suit in the end marks the transition from techy Iron Man inspired Peter as Spider-Man to a Friendly neighborhood vigilante crime fighter who wants to do what's right. And that is who Spider-Man is no matter which actor of comic rendition. Thank you for reading my honest opinion of this great movie.", "Extensive, Exquisite, Nostalagic, with a Emotional Ride. This movie had everything.": "Peter is BACK... !!!What a MOVIE!! Brilliantly done by each and every characters. Best movie of 2021. I loved the movie. Cinematography was absolutely fantastic.

It has its share of fun nostalgia, easter eggs, cameo moments that will rile up the marvel fans. Great if you are into that stuff. But when you get down to it, as a story and character piece, this was complete dumpster fire.The overall plot made no sense. More plot holes and plot contrivances than some of the dumbest and worst marvel/superhero movies in a long time. Character motivation made no sense, and changed on a whim because the plot needed it to setup the next action set piece. Almost all of the characters just behaved erratically like they had bipoloar to fit the nonsensical plot.Marvel fans will enjoy it for the nostalgia \"greatest hits\" movie, but as an actual movie story, complete trash. It was a chore at 2 and 1/2 hours. Just a poor mans version of \"Into the Spiderverse\", which was infinitely better at half the runtime, and without the need for cheap cameos.", "Better than I expected.": "Having just turned 37 years old, I kind of feel I've outgrown comic super hero movies such as Spider Man, which never was my favorite superhero in the first place (more of a Bat Man fan).That being said, I enjoyed this movie very much which was really entertaining and fun to watch. From the very beginning of the movie, we are introduced with fast phased action, which sets the tone for the rest of the movie.The acting is good, the storyline is cool, the scenery is beautiful, there are some really cool action scenes with a lot of suspense, and even the ending was great.One of the things I liked the most about the movie, was the inclusion of the previous Spider Man actors, and all of the three cooperating and fighting together as a Spider Man team.However, I did notice the usual ID politics in this movie (obvious hand picking of actors with different ethnicity to suit mainstream agenda), which came to no surprise.But to be fair, they did a good job as actor regardless, and that's what it's all about when it comes down to it, regardless of sex and ethnicity.All in all, I enjoyed the movie very much, and I'm quite sure you will to.", "One of the worst cinema experiences": "This is not a movie, it is a cartoon for children. What is wrong with Marvel? Can't they get a bit serious and better? The music was Aweful, the cinematography had nothing to offer, the CGI was one of the worst in cinem history. It was all a clout, ticking people with self-published spoilers just to market such a weak piece of work to thhe world without spending a dime. The story was not at all interesting and it had many plot holes. It was cheesy. So many paradoxical and illogical points in the movie. Is this seriously what people love? Has everyone been brain-washed? Do people or the filmmakers for that matter know anything about Technique and form? This was truly a disappointing experience. I hope they change their direction a bit.", "Best MCU Movie?": "Spiderman: No Way Home is directed by Jon Watts. I guess it's obvious for everyone that the movie is receiving a big hype at the moment. The movie achieved pandemic records in the theaters and everyone wanted to watch it, even when they have no clue about the whole MCU.This unique superhero movie combines events from Endgame, Loki (series) and Doctor Strange. Besides Tom Holland, it also stars Zendaya and Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire. Also Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx came back to perform as there villain characters from the Sam Raimi's Spiderman movies and the Jamie Foxx performed as electro again, from Marc Webb's Spiderman movie.The plot is kinda simple, but the scenes are implemented in a perfect way. The Multiverse, in combination with alle the Spiderman movies over the years. Especially seeing Tobey Maguire as Spiderman again feels very nostalgic. I grew up with the Spiderman Trilogy from Sam Raimi and to see Tobey Maguire performing as Spiderman, after more than 10 years, was magnificent.What I mostly enjoyed about the Spiderman Trilogy was the symbiosis between Peter Parker und Spiderman. That was also a part, which I didn't enjoyed in Homecoming and No Way Home. But im this movie it's a perfect interplay between these two characters. The movie focused on Peter Parker and Spiderman and not only on Spiderman.Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin was brilliant again, his inner evilness destroyed Peters plan and the whole situation ran out of control.Also the conflict between Doctor Strange and Spiderman was quite enjoyable. Peters behavior was also very annoying for me as a viewer, because after watching Loki, it was obvious, that all the villains can't escape there fate. But Peter was convinced he can help all of them.After all the three Spiderman's were combined and acted like a team, we reached the peak of the movies. From my point of view, these scenes were one of the best fighting scenes in the whole MCU. Of course they can't compete with the MMA scenes from other MCU movies, but the whole action was brilliant.All in all, very good Marvel movie. For me the best MCU movie in phase 4 and maybe over all.", "Spiderman No way home": "All Spiderman & marvel fans should expirence in big screen ,All actors done there job well & the MCU isn't afraid to step away from the visually spectacular action to develop emotional beats.", "Only for Children": "The high IMDB rating only makes sense if you are 10-15 years old. Then the teen romance with action scenes and infantile characters, jokes etc. Is likely enjoyable.But anyone 18+ will probably roll their eyes out of their head watching this. And yes - I know recent Spiderman movies have been for kids. But the reviews everywhere were soo good - the ultimate Spiderman, a true gem by Marvel bla bla bla.In reality, the movie has an extremely dumb plot... Basically the whole thing happens for no reason at all. None of the characters are actually developed at all, making it impossible to build any connection with them. This then totally doesn't work in the constant \"emotional\" scenes which are overplayed by the actors - while you feel nothing because the characters were not developed.There is actually no villain, and stories from previous movies are disgraced by turning their villains into sick puppies of a sort. And previous versions of Spiderman into emotional basket cases...it feels like a parody, yet it tries to pass along some message...Anyhow it is kind of like watching a high-tech Tom&Jerry - lots of friendly-ish fighting, no overarching plot, just watching silly things happen over and over again.If you are a kid, or a parent getting something for kids, it is probably an OK choice - and actually with decent morals etc. But don't get tricked by the ratings if you are an adult viewer.", "Anticlimatic Movie.": "This just felt like another regular Spider-man movie except it has already been done many times. The Visuals as always are great and the acting is good as well. The main issue is how everything in this movie has already been done except for the 3 cross over Spider-man's being in the same movie. Other than that, the pacing and storytelling and pretty much everything altogether was lacklustre. The final fight scene with the Goblin Guy was mediocre at best. Although the final 20 minutes of everyone forgetting about our main protagonist played by \"Tom Holland\" was an amazing concept and really made everything feel more dreadful.Story: 7/10\nActing: 8/10\nDirecting: 8/10\nQuality: 10/10\nPacing: 5/10\nOriginality: 2.5/10\nConsistency: 5/10\nEnjoyability: 6/10Final Mark: 64/100Probably a good movie for most, but for me it felt dull and boring.", "Dvd": "This movie was soo good!

The actings are amazing especially Tom Holland, the story is really well written, and the soundtrack is chef's kiss.

It's almost as if cinema has died right before our eyes. Every aspect of this movie is heavily contrived and overly emotional. Every decision each character makes is solely driven by emotion, and when that is applied to dr. Strange, it just doesnt work and ruins his character. The one redeeming part of this movie was green goblin, and then the ending happened. It feels like nothing really has any weight anymore. Nothing means anything anymore because you can just pull the same character into your universe at a whim. Just because a movie has tons of fan service, doesnt make it a good movie.

But amid numerous references to Spideys past, the key influence is the one that is most likely to shape the future of the franchise, 2018's Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse. While that thrillingly inventive animation remains the standout film from the Spider-canon - it's a sleek, conceptually elegant thing compared to No Way Home's cluttered, more-is-more approach - here, director Jon Watts harnesses the idea of the \"multiverse\" (an infinite number of parallel universes, each with their own Spider-Man) and satisfyingly puts it to work in the service of a live-action version of the spider saga.

No universe-ending crazyness. Fun and believable Characters without braindead decissionmaking. Also a great dynamic between Peter Parker and Tony Stark.In Terms of story and Script, Far From Home and this one have their Problems, but in comparison to the other marvel-nonsense they still work. What annoys me the most in this movie, is the fact that Dr. Strange is so stupid and incompetent. His screw up spell is what drives the plot. His behaviour and incompetence makes no sense and destroyes his character. He is suppose to be one of the smartest people on earth. Not a careless idiot.

However, after seeing Far From Home, I began looking back at how Stan Lee had initially written the character of Peter Parker. I began to notice how unfaithful the MCU was being with the characterization of their Peter Parker, unlike previous portrayals from Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. Now that's not the fault of Tom Holland, who is a great actor. I just wanted Marvel and Sony to take a different direction. With No Way Home, they finally took that direction and made Spider-Man: No Way Home the best installment in the series.First of all, I'm impressed with the way Marvel handled the return of the original villains from the previous Spider-Man franchises. The action sequences are some of the most epic ones I've seen in both Spider-Man and Marvel films. I'm proud of this film for putting in more emotional depth than the previous films, and it doesn't sacrifice that emotion, unlike most movies in the MCU. Aunt May's death was the film's most moving and emotional scene. Michael Giacchino's score is fantastic, and it's certainly better than the score he did for Homecoming and Far From Home. I also liked how he blended some of his Spider-Man themes with the score he did for Doctor Strange. The cinematography is the best out of every Spider-Man film (including the Raimi and Webb installments). The film's tone starts light and goes darker as the film progresses, and it manages to blend well together.Now here comes the big spoilers. First of all, we finally got to see Charlie Cox reprise his role as Daredevil. While I was hoping to see more of him in the film, I was satisfied with what he did. The post-credits scene with Tom Hardy's Venom was excellent; however, it was short-lived as he quickly returned to his universe. But then again, he accidentally leaves behind a piece of Venom, which makes it possible for a Venom storyline in the MCU. And finally, I can confirm that we got the moment we've all been waiting for: the return of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. It was fun to see the two interact with Tom Holland's Peter, especially the scene where they are creating formulas at Midtown High. But most of all, they get good character development, like when Andrew's Peter saved MJ after failing to save Gwen, and Tobey's Peter stopped Tom's Peter from impaling Norman Osborn, which caused his best friend Harry to become a villain. Let's not forget about Tom Holland's character. After being disappointed with his character in the last two films, Tom's Peter Parker finally gets some of the best character development I've seen in a Marvel movie. Other characters that get good development include MJ, Ned, and even Aunt May. Most importantly, we get the famous Spider-Man motive we all know and remember: With great power comes great responsibility.Spider-Man: No Way Home is packed with emotion, character, and the most epic moments of the MCU that will have the cinema going berserk and bringing down the house. It made me want to give a second chance to a character I had nearly lost faith in. Marvel succeeded in restoring that faith. The last scene of Peter swinging through New York in his new suit is a very satisfying ending. After losing my confidence in Tom Holland's character, I can say Tom Holland's Peter Parker has finally earned his place in the MCU, and I'm hoping he's able to continue the role with another trilogy. Spider-Man: No Way Home is, without doubt, a movie you do not want to miss on the big screen.", "best marvel movie": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is the best MCU film. This movie does not disappoint. The fan service is huge. We got andrew, and tobey back. Aunt may died and I got sad. Rip.", "The Goofs": "We all know the movie was awesome!

It's not as best as EndGame & Infinity war but it's best in it's own way. This is Tom Holland's best performance till date. Zendaya shines as MJ. Benedict as Dr. Strange is fantastic. But I love the performance of Norman as Green Goblin he is fantastic as villain. They could have add more fighting scenes & VFX like Far From Home. 1st half was bit of slow but 2nd half picked some place & the final 30 minutes was just phenomenal. Just Treat to eyes. Yes, final scene will make you emotional without a doubt. It's just worth watch on Big screen. #SpiderManNoWayHomeReview 4/5* #SpiderMan.", "Absolutely brilliant! UNDERSTANDS SPIDEY": "Forget Tobey and Andrew for a minute this movie is spectacular without them. This film could've very well not included the old Spider-Men and have been just as amazing. This movie understands the sacrifices that have to be made when you're Spider-Man that there are always consequences for your actions even the good ones. The cinematography and writing of this movie is excellent, the final swing is triumphant, and the movie is spectacular. Not to mention all of the cameos and the fact that the Spidermen weren't just cameos and they were big characters in the movie and they're shaping who Tom *Spider-Man* becomes in these movies to come.", "Theatre turned into stadium": "For a moment every fan on the planet was eating good, we all got together, laughed, cried, got pure excitement, and rejoiced as we saw our favorite spider-men on the screen together.

Without going into any spoilers let's just say, it ticks all the boxes and then some!Whether you're the ultra MCU head or the childhood spiderman dreamer or even, just a cinema lover who's a sucker for a good movie masterpiece, you don't want to miss this. From nailing the \"spidey\" feel and fundamentals that may have been somewhat missing in the previous two Holland led solo outings, too adding more fuel to that known fire labelled as \"OMG THEY DONE IT AGAIN!\", this one really does do it all, it further projects the progressive possibilities for the cinematic enigma that is the MCU, completes and in some ways ties up a perfect first act arc for Holland's tenure, and even... does a good ol' bit of fan servicing just for an added bit of festive release window joy.So it's probably a given you know this by now but...

His appereances in civil war and endgame were all decent, including the last spiderman.But the one thing that was off for me was the fact that he strayed away from the concept of being the people's hero. I disliked the fact that he was being marketed as the new \"iron man\" and being in posession of so many things taht bears resemblance to Tony Stark, e.g. All the new spider suits.It felt more and more like spiderman was becoming less of a friendly neighborhood superhero and more like a bigger than life figure. But this movie reminded us the core identity of Spiderman, the underdog who never gives up, the ordinary guy with nor resources. This movie really highlighted the growth of Peter Parker as a person, from a kid who always has to rely on ironman to someone that is willing to give up everything for the good of the world.The ending scene where spiderman sews up a spider suit made me tear up. Spiderman was never supposed to be an incrdibly powerful ironman figure with all the wealth of the world, his core identity is his humility and grit, and I'm glad he returned to his roots.", "It's okay.": "Definitely not as good as the reviews are making it seem. Kind of slow overall, sprinkled in some action in the end. Zendeya looks like a teenage caveman.", "Exceeded Expectations!": "The nostalgia throughout the movie is perfectly placed, as well as the comedic timing and fighting scenes. As a Spider-Man fan, this movie above and beyond exceeded my expectations. This movie definitely came from an alternate universe. (Optionally; I highly recommend re-watching all of the older Spider-Man films before this one.)", "Best Spider-Man movie by Tom Holland": "Easily the best movie of Spider-Man portrayed by Tom Holland.Dr. Strange and Spider-Man in Other dimension sequence was fantastic.Only one flaw I can see is the Lizard man and Sand man don't have much things to do. But that can be neglected. Editing could have been better in 2nd half. It's very minimal editing issue.Also Sand man don't die in Spider-Man 3. As per plot all the negative characters come from other dimensions died in there place. It may be a flaw in story telling prospective.Willem Dafoe as green goblin was fantastic.Last 1 hour was superb. Things happens in final act will bring smile on your face.As per story it can comes next to Spider-Man in to Spider verse.

It's okay if the characters are unbelievable. The strength of comic books is having those super characters in relatable situations. Doctor Strange is the protector of our reality, for him to jeopardize that and tweek reality because Ned and MJ weren't accepted into MIT is just not good enough.I know this movie was written by somebody, produced by somebody else, directed by another person after that, but this movie is absolutely owned by Willem Dafoe. Amazing cast all around but Dafoe was on completely different level.", "INCREDIBLE": "This is one of the biggest , bestest spiderman movie till now so much memories, feelings, emotions attached.

Toby Maguire is such a sweetheart in this one. But... Stephen Strange was COMPLETELY out of character. Watching Zendaya after Euphoria playing basic damsel in distress cliche was also painful.The whole point of this movie is a nostalgia trip mixed with awkward fan service. They did have a plot though, it wasn't terrible.. But it wasn't good either.6/10 as a marvel movie. 5/10 as a stand alone movie.", "Enjoy the entertainment": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is an entertaining movie that largely feeds on nostalgia and characters from the Maguire universe in order to re-tell the classic Spiderman story. However, it is not without its issues.Once again, Holland's Spiderman is his own worst enemy, consistently making mistakes and causing the main plot to unfold. By the end of the film, he has finally learned from them and accepted responsibility, maturing as a person.The film's plot holes can be explained away using the multiverse. We haven't learned much about it yet. Hopefully the next Strange film can flesh things out.I struggled with the pacing at times. My attention waned through the romantic moments between Peter and MJ, mainly because their relationship seemed to be based on teenage awkwardness more than genuine chemistry.The fight scenes were pretty cool at first, with the Doc Oc, Strange and GG scenes being clear highlights, but as the movie wore on the overload of CGI hit a point where it became a bit of a blur. And can somebody please explain to me why Hollywood is so fascinated with shaky-cam close-ups during 1 on 1 fight scenes? The still moments were great.Overall, a good movie fueled by nostalgia that probably ran 10-15minutes too long. Now, the question that we're asking: what's next for Spiderman?", "better than sky high(2005)": "This movie was insanely good. I actually enjoyed it more than endgame. The theatre erupted in applause several times throughout the film. Best marvel movie, hands down. I was so nervous it wouldn't live up to the hype, but it exceeded my expectations. 10/10.", "Could have been better!": "It was good to see all of them together, although the scenario was a great bump for me. We had a great example of such a thing like 3 years ago, namely Spiderman: into the spider verse. The hype and all the memories from the previous spidey's made this film good-I should also add the marvellous performance of Tom Holland-but the rest did not catch me that much. Sorry, I wished to.Somebody should have ushered Tobby to the set of a late-night show, that much I did not like his performance.", "With great power comes Multiverse": "This movie archieved all possible emotions in 2 hours and 30 minutes.I honestly didn't expect this movie to hit soo deep in my soul but it did.When I first saw the trailer I thought the premise is quite dumb and after seeing first reviews with incredibly high ratings I wanted to hate it even more but it turned out to be an enjoyable movie.The acting honestly surprised me the most and I know that is weird to say for this movie but everyone was acting simply perfect , especially certain actors that I have not seen in quite some time.The story overall was enjoyable , there are however some questionable moments that make Spiderman a bit overpowered for some reason and that makes a bit of a conflict in ny head regarding other members of the Avengers.Certain death scene in this movie one could sence is coming while watching this movie so it also didnt quite land with me but still overall the movie is dramatic in some moments that do land.The number 1 thing I enjoyed in this movie was the fact that Marvel didn't ruin this one with comedic moments.I also appreciate the fact that even though it is a very ambitious movie it was still grounded and believable.The ending was very bold but satisfied me for years to come.I wish they make a big pause to let this one really put kind of a nice ending to our Spiderman but since I know they value money more , expect another one next year.PlatinumanYT 8.5/10.", "Sony Hits the Mark!!": "I managed to avoid all leaks and spoilers and was pleasantly surprised. There have never been any real stakes in the Tom Holland series. There was genuine investment in the character in this movie and the journey the hero takes as he learns that his actions have real world consequences was excellent. The only thing that keeps me from giving this a 10 is what I will call 'emotional balance'. If a character suffers an emotional blow in one scene, s/he should not be making jokes two scenes later. More time should be spent showing him/her healing before they are ready to behave normally again. Otherwise, THIS WAS GREAT!!!", "Absolutely loved it.": "I think it's one of the best Spidey movies so far, it has everything you would want in a superhero movie. I was told not to watch it as it wasn't very good but that was so untrue, I loved it from start to finish and would recommend that you watch it. Awesome movie.I don't want to say too much and give away spoilers but it has some very clever ideas and and a cool story line.I don't go to the theater to watch it but it was just as enjoyable at home on my big screen tv, although the effects would be fantastic at the theater.I'm looking forward to the next Spidey movie and hope it is as good as this was.

After seeing the the ratings for the movie I thought there was no way I wouldn't like it because every one seemed to. This movie was a theatre experience. The reason it's rated so high is because going to the theatre and seeing all the call backs is fun to see as a shared experience with others. The movie itself is not actually that great though, and in my opinion will not hold up upon rewatching. The plot is actually dumb. The action scenes were boring. Scenes that were supposed to be emotional didn't hit right. It's a bad movie without the nostalgia. I will say I did like the ending though. I believe The series is still on the right track.", "Missed opportunity": "All this hype only to watch the same action scenes that we've already seen in previous films. So many great actors repeating the same lines. This was a golden opportunity to show witty dialogues and epic scenes but the makers have failed miserably. So disappointed!", "felt empty after the end": "I was excited when the trailer came out,it was good to see familiar faces coming back like Doc Ock and the goblin. At that point i was happy even if the other 2 Spidermen didn't show, as i got closer to seeing it my excitement increased. The cameo of Matt Murdock was well done. When Tobey and Andrew came through the portals it didn't feel exciting due to the fact that the rumors were flying through the roof of their appearance. The whole curing them was silly as when they go back to their universe they either die or sacrifice themselves. Continuity details like Pepper Potts' uninvolvement as she would inherit Stark industries or something and also since stark went to MIT a few strings could be pulled,How weak Dr. Strange is portrayed considering he would be sorcerer supreme despite the technicality.It's not a terrible movie but it could have been way better.", "Marvels still got some juju": "After some absolute stinkers, it was such a breath of fresh air to watch this banger of a movie.

The scene that broke my heart is when Andrew's Spider-Man saves MJ,and the Look on his face said it all .He saved MJ but not his MJ. Those scenes just broke me,because you know he gave his all to save her and to hear that every Peter Parker has his MJ but he does not is so sad,the look on his face when he sees Peter and MJ sitting together is heartbreaking .But the end of the movie left me empty because Peter(Tom) was alone no one knows him and he made a decision that broke him to not tell MJ that he loves her like he promised. Would watch it again but with lots of tissues.", "Irrational script...waste of incredible graphics": "Illogical script keeps me bugging throughout the movie.I was not able to enjoy the amazing graphics.Seem like it was total waste.I was totally disappointed.", "The first decent MCU film of Phase 4": "I reluctantly gave this a shot and was very impressed. They did a great job respectfully bringing back some legacy heroes (and villains) and this all made for a fun (if slightly convoluted) story (I mean seriously, Peter, listen to Doctor Strange about the nature of the multiverse. He's sort of an expert).Being in the theater and hearing the thunderous sounds of Doc Ock's tentacles was thrilling. The fights were amazing and I geeked out to see THREE Spidermen all duking it out with the classic villains. This is the Marvel film I've been waiting for, and I'm glad they returned to more story-telling and less agenda promotion.Only negatives really would be the MJ and Ned characters who were mostly an annoyance. You'd cut from an amazing action scene to unnecessarily return to their very unfunny antics. I would have loved to see them scrapped and just focus on the legacy characters but that's just a minor fault. The rest of the film was a blast, particularly seeing Spiderman vs. Doctor Strange duke it out in the Astral Plane, probably the highlight of the film for me.", "Questionable decisions": "I am amazed by the immense hype the film is generating and the reception it is receiving. It feels like the film is being celebrated more for the hype than the content. The content is mediocre at best.Admittedly, I was looking forward to seeing the old faces revive on the big screen. The story, however, which was written around this revival of the old characters is maximally incomplete and unthought-out in my eyes. I just don't understand why Dr. Strange (one of the most omniscient beings in the MCU) performs such a dangerous spell without much necessity. There is simply no logical reason for this decision. In general, the logic of the film is very hard to follow. Then: why do these deceased villains from the other universes come as people who know Spider-Man's identity, of all things?Overall, the whole film seems to be written around the compelling introduction of old characters. Because the film is obviously saturated with fanservice, plot armor, and plot convenience, it was impossible for me to immerse myself into the story. Thus, there wasn't a single moment in the film that touched me, and I find that very unfortunate.Normally 5/10 would be a fair rating, however due to the extreme hype I am forced to give it a much lower rating. May God forgive me.", "A childhood dream come to life": "Imagine taking every live-action version of Spiderman and putting it into one movie. And then throw in one or two Doctor Strange fight scenes. If any of that sounds remotely interesting to you, you'll enjoy watching this movie.I'm not the biggest Spiderman fan, but after watching this, I get what the superfans are going on about. Like Batman, there's a lot of untapped potential here. I do feel we're getting as much out of this as we can at this point, but the Spiderverse is a thing that Hollywood is cashing in on. I'm surprised we got to this point in the live-action version of Spiderman without introducing Miles Morales and Spiderwoman in any of these movies (sorry, those characters are not in this movie).As far as the story goes, it does get muddled with all the character introductions, fight scenes, and lighthearted comedy. It's escapism taking over, and all you can focus on are all the superheroes and villains interacting with each other. There's a MacGuffin, bad guys fighting good guys, and innocent characters getting caught in the crosshairs; it's not anything we haven't seen in most action movies.So, the big question is, do you need to see the previous Spiderman films to appreciate this one? I would say no, but also, you'd understand this movie much more if you've seen all the previous live-action Spiderman movies. I think the MCU, in general, is introducing its fans to the concept of the multiverse, and this is an easy win to include in the whole cinematic motif. This won't be the last time we'll be seeing a Marvel superhero cross over with interdimensional superheroes and villains.And yes, there are easter eggs into other Marvel movies and TV shows in this movie, if that gets you excited.", "most amazing movie": "I think the spiderman movie is my best movie so far. It was so amazing, i just love the love between all the spidermen. Bringing all of them together and how they related with each other shows so much love.", "Mediocre at best!": "This film was mediocre at best just like the majority of Disney's take on the Marvel line up. Disney's found a full proof formula in producing major box office hits and has been using it on every film since the original avengers film. The film has no substance. It just seems like overly produced fan fiction. The problem lies in the fact that they tried fitting too much into one film. A definite injustice was done to Maguires Spiderman with his lacklustre entry into the film, after more than a decade of passing on the mantle of the titular character. The only positive that came out of this film was the sound track. Beautifully crafted. Unfortunately that was the ONLY thing that stood out of this perfectly forgettable film.", "Spider-Man: No Way Home review": "Spider-man no way home was one of the most expected movies of the year and with releasing newer trailer audiences' expectations increased. Personally, I don't like multiverse or parallel universe concepts but after I saw Spider-man: into the spider-verse then I thought this concept can fit to a live action spider-man movie.Let's get back to the movie, Spider-man no way home easily gonna please most Spider-man lovers as we see from the trailers different villains from various spider-man movies is enough reason for that. The movie achieves to connect nostalgia and freshness at the same time while doing this rewards the fans who have seen previous Spider-man movies released since 2000s.While the movie was bringing different characters together from different spider-man movies, it improves some characters for example Electro's characterization is much more convincing than his characterization from the amazing spider-man 2. Spider-man No way home has darker a tone than 2 previous MCU movies and this condition contributes to this movie positively. Now I must mention things that could be better in the movie.Firstly, Dr. Strange's characterization was so passive and we know that he is so much powerful than his depiction in this movie. While some Villains are improved as it was mentioned above Electro's characterization improved significantly in this movie but not every character's characterization has improved the same way Electro's characterization improved. Some of them don't have so much screen time or effect like the Lizard. Since there are variety of characters this condition is understandable but it could have been improved.Another thing is not so good in this movie are the fight scenes. The fight scenes were so cartoonish even though I saw the movie on IMAX, they were so forgettable. I have seen the movie a few days ago but I already have forgotten all of the fight scenes even the Raimi's spider-man 3 had some better fight scenes than this movie. Briefly, Spider-man no way home is the best MCU spider-man movie and it is a good fan service furthermore one of the best movies I have seen this year so far. Everyman who knows Spider-man character must see it.", "THE BEST DAMN MOVIE TO END 2021!!!": "For starters had to see this movie RIGHT AWAY, because people want to spoil it on TikTok! Also love the plot! It's amazing and seat jerking! It is automatically revealed to society that Spider-man is Peter Parker. Something that all the OG Spider-man fans knew since 2002!!!!! PERIOD!!!! Furthermore , I have come a long way with the Spider-man franchise and I am an OG Toby Maguire fan, so Tom Holland once again killed his performance! It was the BEST!Along with Benedict Cumberbatch and William Dafoe! Omg it was so cool to see all the original Spider-man villains together as well! And don't even get me started on freaking ANDREW AND TOBY!! BAD ASS CAMEO!!!!I wanted to scream so loud when Andrew first appeared on screen, same goes for when Toby joined in on Tom's plan to cure all the villains so that they're faith could be changed. Which, in my opinion was stupid, but hey it all worked out in the end and everything sort of went back to normal after that. I didn't like his plan. But again we got a chance to see Andrew and Toby!!!! On SCREEN TOGETHER WITH TOM HOLLAND!!! All three Spider-Men together!!! A well deserved team!!And oh so much sadness on screen! How dare they kill off Aunt May! The OG aunt who took care of Peter! That was so sad! And for a short while sad. Screw you green goblin! A anyways, Loved this movie! Would watch it ten more times just to see all three of my favorite men on screen together! Retelling their tales and retelling how each came face to face with their arch nemesis! And how each of them became the Spider-Man.In conclusion, this movie has the comedy, the romance, the bromance, the thriller, the sadness, and so much more! Man you've just got to see it for yourself! How mind blowing you'll be once you finish the film! You'll have tons of questions, like me, if you haven't been keeping up with Marvel, hopefully not. But all in all best movie ever.", "Felt like I ate out on the fanciest restaurant": "Great writing, great acting, amazing action set-pieces, great everything. I'm blown away by how mature Tom Holland was in this movie, will forever remain as the greatest Spidey film.", "BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER!!!": "Spider-Man: No Way Home Officially Takes No. 1 Place In My Most Favourite Movie List (Sorry Avengers: Endgame You're 2nd Now) So, I Had The Best Cinematic Experience Ever While Watching The Best MCU Movie It's A Must Watch To All The Spider-Man Fans Out There Hence, Please Don't Miss It PLEASE!!! I Really Wish I Could Watch It Again And Again For The First Time But Anyway I Wouldn't Mind Seeing Repeat As Well And That Too, Countless No. Of Times Also, At Few Moments I Almost Teared Up And I'm Very Eager To Talk A Whole Lot About That But Then... I Remembered \"Don't Spoil Spider-Man No Way Home\" At Last I Just Wanna Say Thank You Very Much Marvel Studious For This Megahit Which Is Already 10/10 In My Opinion.", "One Of The Greatest Spiderman Movies of All Time": "Upon watching Spiderman NWH, I have but one thing to say: absolutely mindblowing.From the CGI to the soundtrack of the movie itself, it gives a great send-off to Tom Holland's trilogy, acting like a great exit for possible future films.This movie is superb to die-hard Spiderman lovers and MCU fans in general. It's a great watch and also a very easy movie to go through from the thrilling, action packed scenes to the emotional aspect of it.Beautifully done.", "It's a celebration of all Spider-Man fans!": "#No_Spolier_Review\nThis is the best Spider-Man movie ever made. The storyline is epic you'll laugh, cry and the surprise elements are just insane. The thumping in the theatre was like all Spider-Man fans are assembled for cheering his hero. I never thought I'll witness that level of screaming & excitement from the audience for Spider-Man standalone movie after Avengers Endgame.Everyone's acting is on the top but William Dafoe's Green Goblin attract me the most his act is just lit. In this movie Tom's Peter Parker understand the true meaning of \"Responsibility\" & the end is the new start for him.Action scenes are op but the only con i face while watching the action scenes is lighting. If you're going to watch in 3D, then sometimes the characters are not visible properly in the dark.There are one mid-credit and one post-credit scenes in this movie.", "I'm giving it a ten because it did what we wanted": "It's rare I see a film for its category do it's job. It hit every note you wanted in a SpiderMan superhero genre film and then more. The writing was excellent with some minor plot holes left to the imagination which was perfectly fine. I laughed and I teared up and the action was way better than the last 3 MCU movies. Take note every producer out there making a superhero movie, this is the new bar. Service your fans and stop adding subtle whokeness to the script.", "More than I expected": "I'm a huge Spider-Man fan ever since I can remember.I had high expectations and I'll admit I was kinda worried that it was going to be a bad movie or it would get bad reviews since a lot of people had problems with ffh.

It was more than I could imagine, this makes my inner 5 year old self jump and cry with excitement.This movie just blew my mind, I loved every minute of it!", "Counter": "Just created an account so I can give 10 stars, to counter the people that liked the movie but gave it 1 star so it's not that high up in the best movies of all time list. \ud83e\udd21", "In the latest faces of the spiderman story": "This is the best film of my life, the best film of spideman, this is very impressive and very satisfying. Spider-Man is very insightful and very good at doing this work. I was very happy to contribute to the post. This is not a very happy ending, but I think it's a guide to a lot of stories. I love the movie so much.", "You know what to expect, only less quality than that.": "This movie is really not that great. Hammy acting, cheap storylines, (including Dr Strange manipulating the timeline so 3 college students can get a 2nd chance at Colllege!!!). What the hell is THAT nonsense.And Spiderman, going to fight Dr Strange and risk the timeline again just to potentally save a few mortal enemies. I mean, it's really weak stuff. Dr Strange manipulating the timeline for stopping Thanos is one thing, but this!!!However, of course the SFX are fine, and it's OK to see the 3 Spidermen on the screen at he same time.Really quite average for a Marvel Movie.", "Absolutely Marvel-lous": "This has to be the ultimate spider-Man movie all time. Great chemistry from all the actors involved, Tom Holland as always it's getting better with each movie he does as Spider-Man. And with a few surprises in the movie it is just the ultimate movie in the franchise.", "The best spider man movie of all time": "This is one of the most brilliantly written scripts ever. The whole cast of no way home gaved there best. Specially tom Holland and William dafoe. The vfx were incredible. A must watch movie.", "One of the best spiderman movie ever": "This movie is a very very good movie and all 3 spiders were awesome and also the villains and doctor strange and the multiverse, all were good but i hope if we see the 3 spidermen again and if marvel make a third amazing spiderman movie of andrew garfield would be great.", "Many Amazing Moments but Not One Great Moment": "The movie has so many amazing moments but it didn't have a great one. Well, I didn't expect it but it still felt like a letdown.The real culprit? Marvel trailers.The trailer already ruined the biggest surprise of the movie by showing us Dr Oct and Goblin. Further, they brought Jamie Foxx for the promotion.Most of us knew what the biggest surprise is going to be and when that happened, it didn't feel like that big.All then left the acting, action sequences and cinematography to carry the movie.Even the plot wasn't strong to begin with.The movie has a group of villains but no-one was good enough.And not to mention many loopholes in the movie.But overall, it was an entertaining one if ignore the loopholes and surprises that they carelessly throw at us.", "Does nostalgia cloud the flaws here?": "I'm still debating with myself if the pure nostalgia factor and how amazingly well they managed to bring all the old characters back and there were many moments that were so satisfying to watch that actually addressed the character arcs in the other movies in this one. However, is this more nostalgia porn than a well built story?? I don't know the answer to this and I certainly don't care what a great movie to watch and total escapism!The only real flaw in the movie was that the first 15/20 mins or so there were many many cheesey lines and moments but what do you expect from a marvel film? I quickly got over it and I believe that anyone who could hold it against the film as a whole need to get over themselves.", "it's good....but not that good": "Don't get me wrong i very much enjoyed this movie. However it's not 10/10 like many people are rating it. It was a very good idea, great acting, but the plot feel short. To me the script was written for the sole purpose of being andrew garfield and tobey magurie back. Without them the movie wouldn't have been as good. This movie benefited from the nostalgia of the previous spidermans.", "Spider-Man: Let me go home.": "Absolutely terrible. Was about 2 hours too long! Should have been called 'Spider-Man: I want to go home'. Sentimental, soppy and storyline was daft. Literally had me climbing the walls.", "Good movie but definitely overrated.": "Don't get me wrong the movie ain't as bad as Black Widow was but the movie is definitely overrated. They even have the balls to say it's the \"the best Marvel movie ever\". Endgame and Infinity War is better and those movies were overated as well. Also I cannot forget the plothole mess it is but I won't explain as they have been explained multiple times on YouTube. Also if you like dirty, generic MCU humour it's all there.Ok now to some pros (Spoiler Territory): The old villians return from Green Goblin to Doc Oc to even that Electro. All have their original actors reprising the roles. Actually exploring the consequences of Peters actions like for example trapping Doctor Strange in a mirrored Grand Canyon which causes alot of consequences like hot Aunt May death. Also we got the return of Tobey and Andrew's Spider-Man and even Daredevil actor from the Netflix show makes a cameo. With Tobey and Andrew with the time they had all done very well.The movie is a 6/10 at best but definitely not the 9/10.", "Stupid and cheap": "During the movie I felt myself cheated from the first 30 minutes of teenage soap opera to the end credits.For starters the teenage \"Bold and the beautiful\" part was so embarassing I was thinking about leaving the theatre.The \"Marvel Harry Potter\" episode which actually started the main plot was so stupid that I felt like Patrick Steward slapping his forehead from disbelief.Finally the multiverse idea which was partly sort of ok was way too swallow. In my opinion it was just a tool for a lazy scripwriting allowing about everything to happen on the screen without much of an explanation because \"anything can happen when different universes collapse\".The movie wasn't a total disaster though. Some of the action scenes were highly entertaining and even though the multiverse plot was stupid and broken it allowed older actors to take a part to the movie.Some claim this to be the best MCU movie ever. It is not even close: Mediocrity at it's finest definition.", "BEST MCU MOVIE BY FAR!!": "Perfectly ends the home coming trilogy, whilst setting up so much potentially for the next one. The Familia faces seen through out the movie are use so well and each spider-man has an emotional connection to the other. The biggest part about this movie is the disconnection of spider-man from iron man, now since everyone forgot who peter is, now he's just a guy renting an apartment, making his own suit (that looks so good).", "spiderman no way home to over hyped": "If the other spider man characters were not in this movie then it would not get this high of a rating also remember in 2007 when spider man 3 came out which had 3 villains which people were complaining about saying it was overstuffed well that is exactly what is going on in this movie not only that but tom Holland who wants to help people really isn't with this spell he is asking dr stange to do because it causes the villains from other worlds to show up and cause havoc which ends up killing his aunt and hurting his friends the cgi is no wear as good and the previous films also its slow i was 45 minus in and the only villain to show up was dock oc now i know this movie is 2 hours and 30 minutes but it needs to be longer and have more action and a better story just because you make it fan service through out doesn't mean you skip on the plot or the characters the new Mary jane is so annoying and what is with his side kick really he should have been kick out after the first movie and electo and sand man you dont see until the near end and what is spider man fighting dr strange it makes no sense compared to the spider man 3 this is way to over stuffed to many plot holes and crappy acting aslo the comedy through out the movies takers away any emotion that would have impacted the viewer oh and non of the jokes landed or were funny.", "I love superheroes": "I love spiderman so much, he is my favorite superhero character, spiderman is as handsome as ever, I will always support it, I hope spiderman can be filmed forever.", "A litle bit earlier!": "It's a good movie, but you could do so much more with Tobey and Andrew. It would be much better if they came in a little earlier in the film so they got a bigger part in it. But overall a very good movie that can almost be compared to Endgame!", "maybe just because I'm not a marvel fan but": "I found this a tiny bit boring at parts but overall it was good. Some scenes became repetitive for me honestly I really like the MJ and Spider-Man story obviously well written. Overall average movie for me but maybe just because I'm not a big fan of marvel movies.", "I had to see it multiple times": "This movie was Amazing! Definitely thw pinnacle of all Spider-Man movies so far. The return of all movie villains and Andrew and Tobey is only thw tip of the ice berg.If there was one single super hero film I could suggest to draw in old fans or new, this is definitely the one. The action, the drama, the comedy and the accuracy to the characters is amazing.

Worthy to watch more than once. Story line would be little small, but story picturised very well and had a good suspense stuff in the film. It's emotional, loved, action, adventure one film....", "Best and worst of them all...": "I really wanted to like this movie, on the surface it has a plethora of characters, many backstories and the potential for a great movie. It just never got off the ground, a butt Tom Holland futilely trying to hide the fact he has been exposed with a curtain is about as funny as it got. Matt Murdoch's addition goes nowhere and after the movie's both meaningful and lackluster ending, I was left wondering whether it was simply a way of adding to the Loki/Doctor Strange sequel coming up soon or whether it really had any point at all.... A least we know Wong is in charge these days :D.", "Just got home!": "So just got back from regal and had to write a review. All I have to say is this is everything I've ever wanted in a spiderman film and more. The emotional toll this film took on me was epic.

To me, it has few good and worth watching aspects but not as high as its hype. Slightly over rated.", "One way to Describe this Movie - Nostalgy": "Where to start and where to finish with this movie. If you are not the guy who has spent time watching original Spider-Man movies on a dvd-player, then and only then you are allowed not to put 10 stars here. So many memories come alive watching this movies. Just a masterpiece!Nonetheless, the movie itself is done perfectly too. It has it all. Action, comedy, emotion and more. The only downside maybe is the lack of explanation in the quantum mechanics thing the but I think that it was done in purpose. I think it is a MUST TO WATCH movie, and you can't rate it under 7 stars.....", "Best Spiderman movie probably of all time": "Mind blowed over and over\nJust watch it on the big screen.I loved it so so so much\nNot gonna spoil it\nEnjoy.A mixture of emotions comedy excitement\nEverything we ever dreamt of.", "This was cool": "Ok so I saw this movie and I thought it was cool, it was a bit depressive but also very enjoyable.. it was very nice to see the three Spiderman together, the only thing I didn't like was the ending but overall the movie was very good and enjoyable.", "Okay okay": "It's an okay movie,but could have executed well better. The plot feels stupid to watch,like shot just randomly happens, and it's over. Execution felt dull.", "YEAH YEAH YEAH!!!!": "Don't worry, you won't be disappointed.(No Spoilers ahead)This shows a lot of rollercoaster between comedic and sad. It explained very well and rapture my eyes into the heaven. As you seen it from fan's hopes, this one don't let you down even you have slightly higher expectation.This is the best way to bridge a lot of MCU's future ahead!", "Not worth the hype created": "Looks like majority of Marvel fanbase are child or teenagers. I got bored while watching this. Nothing dark just plain storyline suitable for kids. Dont think i am a DCEU fan. Previous movies shang chi and eternals are very good compare to this. I definitely rate them 9 or 10. Bit this isn't worth 5 stars.", "Headline: Selfish Teenager Kills Aunt by Contuing to Make Terrible Decisions": "Don't get me wrong I really liked the movie and I think team marvel did a great job stepping Spider-Man back from the cosmic stage as the MCU continues to move forward to more grandiose things beyond the friendly neighborhood this character is typically associated with. But it's just another story about the supposed hero sacrificing others to potentially redeem the villan so he or they can go on to commit additional crimes and kill more innocents further down the road. So it goes back to the old argument of who the villan of the film or medium is...Is it Batman or the Joker, Spider-Man or the Green Goblin, Daredevil or the King Pin?That argument aside, as mentioned I did really like the film, especially all of the cameos, in particular the Matt Murdock one, the glimpse of what looked like the Living Tribunal when the sky tore open and the other Peter Parkers that showed up, although it would have been good to see glimpses of Miles or Spider Gwen as well. Also enjoyed the end credit scene that pointed to the arrival of Venom in the MCU.So if you get a chance head to the theater and catch this one.", "Not only the best spiderman movie but also one of the best marvel movie": "THIS IS DEFINITELY A MASTERPIECE, I LOVED IT A LOT, MAINLY THE SECOND HALF IS CRAZY, THE FIRST HALF IS ALSO VERY GOOD AND CRAZY BUT THAT 2ND HALF JUST BLOWN MY MIND AWAY, CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT AGAIN....SPOILERS: TOBEY AND ANDREW ARE IN THIS FILM AND THE MOMENTS WITH THEM ARE JUST AMAZING, THOSE ENTRACES ARE CRAZY...LOVED ALMOST EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS FILM, VILLAINS ARE AMAZING MAINLY GREEN GOBLIN, STILL IT'S TOM HOLLAND WHO STEALS THE SHOW WITH HIS WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE, THIS FILM WORKED EMOTIONALLY VERY VERY WELL, THAT CLIMAX IS HEARTBREAKING.........", "Okay. love the crossovers the rest was eh": "Mild spoilers ahead \u26a0Yesterday I went to see No Way home. And I was half happy half indifferent. This is the movie that you need to have two perspectives. Just like Infinity War. One is when you're watching it in MCU lens, one is when you're watching it in a cinematic/movie lens.I shall say that the trailer showed TOO MUCH. In fact there're major spoilers IN the trailer itself. Tom uttered about forgetting him and you can tell where it is going already. From the trailer, they also showed all the villains so that is already a big clue that it is going to be a fanservice movie. Then we also see that Dr strange looked constantly troubled, then he told the kids to \"Scooby Doo this thing\" meaning that he sure did an oopsie on his spells. It's pretty obvious, and from there, you'll 100% know where it goes. Unless you're thinking too much.There're two factors that will drive the movie. It is that Peter(Tom) wants people to forget and wants to turn bad guys to good. That's. All. Really \ud83d\ude02 So the plot goes about him wanting people to forget about Peter as Spidey \u27a1 wants to change the bad guys to good \u27a1 then back to wanting to be forgotten . \ud83d\ude43 Quite ironic that it is a movie about an intelligent characters but the director wasn't intelligent.There're familiar quote droppings in this movie you could say it's a meme too. Hell the 3rd act was literally a meme that came to life \ud83d\ude02 The highlights were mostly the \"alternate endings\" and of course the cameos. Which comes off a bit like the appearance of Han Solo and Chewbaca's cameo in SW: The Force Awakens movie. Since they stayed until the end, it's more of an appearance than a cameo. It is also not really a spoiler because the two Spider Men were at the red carpet, doing interviews and IMDB also have their names listed as casts blatantly.The script were poorly written that there weren't many natural quotes or expressions. Especially the part where Tom asks Doc Octavius his name. It was so cringeworthy. I mean it wasn't even a new joke. It is a recycled joke and formulaic. There're a lot of \"Do you like this? Do you miss this Do you remember this? \" scenes. Instead of \"Let me present my creativity\"Also I noticed that they love to use the simplifying jokes such as stones, wizard, and especially \"purple alien\" .. \ud83d\ude12 Starlord's joke about purple alien/grimace was ENOUGH. We don't need to hear it 5000 times. It's getting more unfunny the more they repeat it. They even continued that joke until the after credit scene.. \ud83d\ude12Goblin was the MVP because he killed someone (and stabbed). His motives makes sense AS a villain. He was the only assertive one among the other villains. He told them that they don't need fixing which I kinda agree. Why would an already villain who endangered lives of the innocents needs fixing? Reptile was smart too but he is kinda sloppy. Therfore Goblin is the smartest of the bunch I mean afterall, he is something of a scientist himself \ud83d\ude0fThe MIT admin scene was so unrealistic. I mean Dr Oct already destroyed a magnitude of a bridge and she just got out and said \"tHaT iS a nO nO\"... \ud83d\ude12 cringe. With all due respect ___ scene appearing also was very unrealistic because no normal human... or shall I say, superhuman would be so casual seeing the Portal \ud83d\ude43 \ud83d\ude02... They should have been shocked tremendously seeing that magic... But anything for fanservice right? Make kids happy and all. \ud83d\ude02I can also see a bit of political message when they talk about \"2nd chances\" aka releasing people from jail and they picked statue of liberty \ud83d\uddfd as the battlefield. There's a mid scene where the villains all gathered together in the sanctorum. And all they did was empty talks. It was soo dreadful. The mid credit scene showed that the symbiote remained in the bar. Which means they're 100% linking venom to MCU or at least the symbiote. They already confirmed this in Venom 2 though. Then the post credit was more of a sneak peak/teaser for Dr Strange Multiverse of Madness which seems like the continuation/plot of episode 4 of What If series.Remove Green Goblin, Dr Oct and Dr Strange and the movie is mediocre. However, I 100% appreciate the crossovers \u2665 and the change of Electro's suit. At least it happened. So in a perspective of Marvel/MCU I would rate this an 8/10. In a perspective of just a movie enjoyer Imma give this a 5/10. And I am no longer an \"MCU fan\" so that'll be my final score.", "AMAZING!!": "It's so good that it's worth seeing a few times.The film has small mistakes But the film is so full of emotions and wonderful scenes that it makes the film perfect,In this movie, you laugh, you shed tears and you being Goose bumps.", "As huge fan, I'll be serious and conscious": "The movie makes some plot aspects and moments to be less solid and natural, some moments are also too much convenient and even infantilized. The movie is a full gift to Spider-Man fans of different generations. One of the best things about, excluding Tobey and Andrew's moments, is how this movie evolves and prepares Tom Holland's character to future movies. Almost all the villains that returned received good and satisfying scenes at the film and the way the movie grows is serious and a little dark if compared to usual MCU movies. You can't watch this movie without being excited, happy and emotional. As almost every MCU movie, this one doesn't try to be a cinematographic masterpiece. What John Wats wanted and achieved with this release is a heartbreaking unbelievable Spider-Man film that honors and homage the past webhead films.", "ONE OF THE BEST SUPER HEROES MOVIES EVER MADE": "I Totally recommend all to people to watch this phenomenal at cinema.

Greatest spiderman movie along with Sam Raimi's Siderman 2. It has those big moments and an unexpected one. The interaction between spideys is great. The acting of the Tobey, Tom and specially Andrew and Willem was superb. Somehow the the MCU managed to turn every spiderman movie into one, and in my opinion that was great. All the characters had a wow moment and the movie basically gave us a taste of Doctor Strange 2.", "All the feels": "For me Into the Spiderverse shone as the best Spiderman film because of its huge heart. This gets really, really close. Everyone involved play absolute blinders. There are moments where you'll have the hugest grin on your face and moments where you have a huge lump in your throat. Absolutely played to the legacy of Spiderman on film but also doesn't just do so for fan services. I loved it.", "AMAZING & WONDERFUL": "It's really the best spiderman film ever. I didn't expect this film to be so extraordinary. There were so many amazing surprises and beyond the expectations of fans. I hope there will be another Spiderman trilogy. One word Amazing.", "THE MOST ENJOYABLE MARVEL FILM TO DATE": "Jon Watts' dazzling, exciting, funny, big-screen superhero blockbuster that really delivers. It picks up where the previous film \"Far From Home\" left off, Spider-Man, wonderfully played by Tom Holland, secret identity as Peter Parker has been revealed to the world, which has made his life utterly chaotic so in desperation he turns to Doctor Strange, superbly played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who casts a powerful spell to make everyone forget that he is Spider-Man, but something goes terribly wrong and the multiverse is shattered, which has the effect of bringing back nefarious super villains from the past that threaten the destruction of the entire world. This genre epic is a real game changer with astounding action sequences, eye-popping visual effects, a strong nostalgic feel, and a few big surprises. Solid direction Watts, with impeccable performances by Zendaya, Willem Defoe, Alfred Molina, Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, Jamie Fox, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau, J. K. Simmons, Tony Revolori, and Benedict Wong. The best and most enjoyable Marvel film ever.", "LOST FOR WORDS!": "I had the highest expectations ever driving to the cinema today. NWH blow my expectations away and went far above them. This movie had everything a superhero movie needs to be complete. The drama, the battles, THE MULTIVERSE! The scene where we get to meet old friends for the first time in movies history like this made me cry rivers while my heart skiped a beat.This movie have no singel plothole which is rare in todays movie industrie. The performance from Tom Holland is above any actor that has played Spider-Man before him from now on. Tobey came back as a better version of himself and Andrew as a darker and more sad one. I can now see the perfect way to move forward with the Tobey and Andrew Spider-Man movies in a extremely good way. The possibilites after no way home is endless!DC, your move!", "What did I saw": "This movie was way too long and boring also the action lacked any depth like the train scene of spider man 2 which is still the best expected action scene of all time it was messed up action in climax where you don't know what's going on also there was no new creative scene I didn't enjoyed after first 30 minutes.", "A rollercoaster from start to finish.": "Without any bias, it's pure fun with great character development, and a love letter to any Marvel fan; great mix of emotions that pack a punch. The future of MCU Spider-Man shines bright.Movie of the year, undoubtedly.", "So everyone's good really....meh": "Remember in the other Spiderman films when they defeated the bad guys, well apparently that was bad so now we've got to forget about all the evil they did or the folk they've killed and give them a big hug.This seems to be the new Hollywood normal and I'm getting very tired of their preachy moral storylines.Good nostalgia trip but it's not a film I will be watching again, it's not a patch on the rest of the MCU.", "Can we please not give Jon Watts another big live-action film": "Was good, my expectation for this was indeed very high so some of my demands were not met, in some reveals there was little suspense or surprise, action was very average, its almost like they put things in for fan service without having to address it or blend it into the film in any way... The original plot to the film serves to push the chaos without ever closing it... weird, probably not even in the top 3...5 mcu films.", "It's pretty good, but flawed, this is not a 10/10 people": "It's absolutely crazy that this movie is getting 10s all over the board. Currently sitting at 9.2 on imdb. I'm not going to vote it a 1 to bring it down cause that's not fair to the movie. I think it's a 7-8 out of 10. That means I liked it, but it's not even close to a perfect movie. And this movie isn't as good as The Dark Knight.The good - The performances were amazing. Tom Holland does his best acting to date and really sells the role. The cameos and guest appearances were great for nostalgia sake. Some were better than others.The bad - The concept is pretty dumb. Without getting into major spoilers, Peter essentially is fine with risking timelines and the world just so him and his friends can go to college and have more normal lives. It is a little more in depth than that, but that's essentially the concept of the movie. It's just a super dumb move for a character who has been through the Thanos events. Makes no sense.The CGI is pretty bad, especially for some of the villains, just looks really fake.This all said, the performances make the movie and sell it so that it is more believable. If not for the actors, I would rate this lower. It is a fun movie but leave some of your brain at home.", "A Chaotic Themed cartoon with great fight scenes": "It's chaotic, scenes feel stitched together, lots of forced emotional scenes. They definitely used the checkbox method. Fight scenes are well choreographed, have weight, intense and surprising. Spiderman: No Way Home failed to surprise me in the emotional scenes but exceeded my expectations in the beautifully choreographed hand to hand combat.", "FUll happening movie": "This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman. I loved every second of it!", "One of the best Spider Man movies in recent years": "Now, ever since I was a kid, I've been a huge Spider-Man fan, particularly when it comes to the films, wether it'd be Sam Raimi's charming theatrical productions, the MCU's amazing CGI spectaclars, or Mark Webb's... harmless adaptations, they were all great (back in the day at least). So when I heard that the inevitable third installment in the MCU trilogy was not only bringing back Tom Holland and Zendaya back on the big screen, but along with them Andrew Garfied, Alfred Molina and Tobey Maguire, I was extremely excited, and went to watch it right when it first launched. Needless to say, it did not disappoint.The story is actually really interesting. Following off of the events of the last movie, Mysterio is arrested in public after being stopped by Spidey, but before he was sent to jail, he reveals Spidey's true identity to everyone around New York city. Not only that, but Peter Parker ends up being recognized as a criminal, which obviously brings serious consequences to him and his future, so he meets up with his Avenger friend, Doctor Strange, to cast a spell on veryone who knows Peter to forget that he's Spider-Man, but that brings in its own set of consequences, as all of the Spider-Man villains from other dimensions to MCU Spider-Man's dimension, and so it's up to Spider-Man to stop the villains one last time, with the additional help from two other Spider-Men from other dimensions.It's obviously no Shakespeare, but it's a really awesome story, and far better than the \"It's a wonderful life\" route I was initially thinking this story would take, what with the main character being transported to an alternate reality where all his loved ones forgot about his existence and what not. It's also very interesting in the sense that it offers an unique twist to the \"stop the baddies\" plot by having the villains being cured of their powers instead of being defeated. This already great story is greatly complemented by the amazing acting from both the new and old Spidey actors, especially from Alfred Molina as Doc Ock, the great sense of humor coming from the interactions between the three Spider-Men and the between villains, and the massive amount of fan service, such as J. Jonah Jameson (played by the legendary JK Simmons as always), the F. E. A. S. T building, all the antagonists from the first two trilogies (even if there was no The Amazing Spider-Man 3), etc.Obviously, no movie is without a sin, and this film is no different, as there's an excessive amount of unimpressive CGI, especially with Tom Holland's suit. Not only that, but it also has a whole lot of pop culture references and attempts to be hip with the kids, like Donkey Kong Jr., TikTok, Minecraft Spider-Man skin, and it's all just starting to feel like pandering at this point, just as much as Avengers Endgame.But overall, I'd say this is a great, if slightly flawed Spider-Man flick. I'd most definitely reccomend it to Spidey fans, fans of the MCU, or just casual film viewers. Trust me, you won't regret watchig it.", "Messy, erratic, overlong, but entertaining enough.": "Entry three in the Tom Holland Spiderverse continues where the last left off, immediately in fact. Not just in terms of story, but it carries over similar issues with an abundance of narrative messiness, tonal shifts and a feeling that the film is shoehorning too much into the mixer. I enjoyed the first entry due to the relative simplicity and a focus on Parker's everyday teen struggles. Holland was okay, if a little lacking in charisma, but as an on screen Parker, he was probably the most accurate depiction. He just lacked the nuance of Garfield and Maguire. By the second film, subtlety was thrown by the wayside, the jokes overwhelm the drama and No Way Home begins in the very same way. A beginning that should have Parker in a state of shock and anguish, his world torn apart, is loaded with silly gags which do disservice to the drama. This continues throughout the film. Drama builds, goofy humour, the MCU wont, takes over.Is the MCU running short on ideas? Is the Sony factor a negative? To be honest, despite this being a transitional film, it's every inch a Feige formula movie. I found so much of this frustrating, even if said humour still had enough in it to make the film a breezy viewing. The key strength however, comes in the form of the three Spidermen coming together in unison. It's a short film concept that is great, shoved into the second act of this film that makes it (finally) interesting. It also only serves to show us that, whilst Holland lacks the gravitas to give his two dimensional role gravitas, Garfield has no such problems. He's the heart of the picture, albeit brief, and almost (almost...) makes me ponder revisiting the films that weren't up to his level. Maguire comes a close second and he just seems happy to be back in the spotlight. Still, this diversion, can't make up for what is mostly a messy chore but Spidey's aside, Willem Defoe lights up his scenes as only he can.", "Amazing and Incredible!!!!": "Holy moly!!!!This is awesome!!!!The 3 Spider-Man's are so awesome and fantastic!!!!I was surprised to see Tobey Maguire & Andrew Garfield returned as the Alternate Peter Parker/Spider-Man!!!Tom Holland as Peter-One\nAndrew Garfield as Peter-Two\nTobey Maguire as Peter-ThreeThe best Spider-Man movie of the year!!!!! A+", "Endgame and Infinity war are still in the top spot": "Its great to see the old cast back. I love the fact that Andrew Garfield got the praise he deserves. But the plot doesn't make any sense at all. They could've done better with the film. And it wasn't nostalgic enough since the entire plot was kind of obvious and some scenes were leaked as well.", "creative piece of work": "I had so much fun watching it, the movie was funny and creative; they really know how to please the audience and put something for everyone. The whole thing about maybe villains doesn't deserve to die even if they made mistakes is humane and beautiful; creative writing and good story.", "Good nostalgic movie \ud83d\udd77": "It is a good Spider-Man movie and it's every nostalgic because we get to see the best Spider-Man villains like Green Goblin, Dr Octopus, Electro, Sandman and the Lizard again. The best parts of the movie are ofcourse the Tobey and Andrew moments.Even tough it's very nostalgic, the two Spider-Men could be brought back in a better way and they should have been mentors to Tom. They don't even have very great fight scenes, it was just Tom who really fought good. The story isn't very great either and the movie has many plot holes.It was overall a good *Spider-Men* movie.", "This is my first review. This movie is garbage.": "I watched every MCU movie and i really enjoy super hero movies.This movie doesn\u00b4t make any sense at all. The plot is absolutely ridiculous and the movie only exists because every character makes the stupidest decision possible at any given moment.The only positive thing about the movie is the nostalgia. Bringing in the Spider Men from other universes was a nice touch but the rest of the movie is unwatchable.It really saddens me that this piece of garbage is ranked between the best movies of all time. If I can offer a piece of advice, don\u00b4t waste your precious hours with this movie, it\u00b4s just not worthy.", "In my opinion, a overrated flick": "It was a pretty satisfying Spider-Man movie, but I don't think it deserves 8.4. There are some plot holes here and there, characters not having to be somewhere but being there just for the sake of the story, and in my personal opinion the entrance of the other two spideys is a bit lacking. Overall this is not a garbage movie, I just expected something else, something more from it. It did have a good ending though, personally I really love when Spider-Man ends the movie with a mixed energy of sad and inspiring.", "A fun, creative movie and the best Tom Holland Spiderman film to date.": "I'm mostly done with the MCU, but considering how much I enjoyed the first two MCU Spiderman films I was interested in seeing this one. Fortunately, it didn't disappoint.This movie does fan service correctly in a way that actually nicely ties into the plot. I love the interactions between different characters, the set pieces, as well as the fact that there actually were some pretty serious consequences for Peter during and at the end of the film (won't give them away).The special effects are, of course, excellent (just what you'd expect from a movie made with Disney money). The soundtrack is decent, also the acting from Holland, Dafoe, Foxx etc. All great.So overall, this is an enjoyable popcorn movie with some genuinely emotional moments as well as a unique plot which isn't just \"big bad guy wants to destroy/invade the world.\" I recommend this film to anyone who saw the last two Tom Holland Spiderman films and wants to see the best instalment yet. Also to those who have seen the older Spiderman films.", "Hit it out of the park!!!!! but it could have gone further": "A strong fun entertaining movie that makes you want to scream for joy every second of it but lacks it foundation within the plot itself. The film includes amazing performances by William Defoe and Tom Holland and brings out emotion on every turn but sometimes it feels more of a fan pleaser film rather than a good quality film at times. Overall an awesome new installment for the franchise.", "Good but the movie is overrated my opinion:(7.4/10)": "Analysis\n-Good start (It was a little cheesy)\n-Good action and budget (Nothing amazing but I loved the CGI for sandman a lot!!)\n-Good drama (It felt long and dragged out at parts and had some weird plot lines)\n-Loved the nostalgic feeling of having all Spider-Man's back\n-The movie was very underwhelming which made the rating for it much lower then it could have been.-Decent pacing\n-Emotional ending (the ending was the best part of the movie. (The last 25 minutes)", "Great Collaboration But rehashing other stories": "Make no mistake I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end, My problem was that it didn't really seem more spider man movie as opposed to just more spider Men ,bringing back villains from all the other movies seems like a great Call back but you ascribe it a lack of imagination and you know trying to point out that this Peter Parker has a better heart than the rest. Which does he really. He was going to kill someone.", "Waited to watch this and here it is": "Watched it after all the hype settled down obviously knew Maquire and Garfield were going to make an appearance (worst kept secret even before the film was released) all this film did was remind me that the first two spider man films were the best and probably will never be beaten. Doc Oc and Green Goblin stole the whole film, both actors are class and showed how weak all the other enemies have been ever since. Time to end Spider-Man now. I remember watching the first movie and it blew me away so much cgi now that I don't think I'll ever be impressed with a film like that again. However this film was good and and enjoyable watch for any old school fan.", "Great addition to the mcu": "I loved this movie, the fan service was fantastic and seeing the different versions of spiderman and the various villians after so many years made it specialHowever let's be real, this wasn't the best movie of all time. The story was just ok - the fact dr strange and Peter didn't think about the spell before casting it was silly given how intelligent they are.While this movie was definitely good, it is ONLY rated as highly as it is because of the nostalgia factor. It should not be the #8 movie of all time on IMDb.", "Best Mcu Movie": "Every MCU movie is trash compared to this, tons of heart humor and good action, good job marvel, for once.... like actually the only good marvel movie ever, everything else is either trash or meh af.", "Full stars": "I'm going ahead and giving it every star and I haven't watched it yet, I know I will enjoy it. I will be seeing it today and can't wait been waiting awhile and haven't spoiled myself with anything, usually I look up the post credit scenes but not for this one.", "Hmmm...not as good as expected, just not bad": "Storyline is literally fine, I won't talk much on it, I will just focus on some setting and logic issue.1. Whoever teleported to MCU must be someone who knows Peter Parker is Spiderman? Electro? Venom? You can even see Rhino in the crack of Multi-universe...2. The purpose of Sandman is to go back to his own universe and stay with his daughter, then why does he help \"villains\" to fight?3. Dr. Strange is so steady to cast the \"forgetting\" spell (I don't remember the name) at the beginning, but so dull and hesitated at last, I know he saw Peter's plan worked (but only in term of Science), but shouldn't he be the one propose to cast the spell initiatively instead of Peter? It's more like the movie wants us to see Peter's growth, but in a deliberate way.Anyhow, I still have fun watching it.", "So Good...the best film of Tom Holland's trilogy!": "The story line is amazing, and so different and unexpected, I love that.MJ, a fan favorite, once again brings the humor all throughout the movie, she's just so amazing.Near the end some very unexpected twists happen, and you find yourself truly wondering what will transpire, will Spiderman find a way home?Can he fix everything that was undone?But the end result was more than I'd hoped for, except for the extremely sad end...Tom Holland said it best, Bring Tissues!!", "META-NOSTALGIA": "This was a wonderful and warming soup of everything Spider-Man is: A fun, sincere, selfless, emotional and full story that comes to a bittersweet end. You make us cry, Marvel.", "What going on here": "Not the best spiderman film, was hoping it would have been alot better. Its all over the place not for me really. Good see all the spidermans, long film for what it is. I will not be watching this spiderman again.", "Amazing Movie!": "Rarely leave reviews for movies but this one deserves it so much. Loved every single second of it and honestly just a breathtaking movie, wish I could experience seeing this movie again for the first time.", "Spidey returns!": "My thoughts on Spiderman: No Way Home are that the fights scenes are too weak, the characters are all off and undeveloped and the villains feel like the CGI was totally wasted. Let me first say that I think it the best part of the movie was when Spiderman flew across the city. The CGI was great. I also liked the inescapable problem. The night was so dark that he couldn't stop to save a child who needed a doctor and the child died in his arms. Out of 10, I'd rank Spider-Man: No Way Home an 8. I say this because it was really a mediocre Spidey movie. There were plenty of fight scenes and some great action moments but as far as heroes and villains go, it just didn't meet the bar for a Spiderman movie.", "Not the best of the series, predictable and nullifies a lot at the same time": "I get the story, but too bad it was pretty much a total rip-off out of \"Into the Spider verse\", in essence.Good action and all that, but dang. I found this sort of disappointing in the end.While watching it you don't know what's going to happen, so you sit there and try to explore what's happening and all that, but when it's over you're kind of relieved that it is. This is apparently a prelude to the next Dr. Strange-movie, so it wasn't a total waste of time.No, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, but it did feel a bit out-of-place, especially since you've (presumably) already seen the \"Into the Spider verse\".But, what really gets me is that some of the end-results of the outcome, without revealing too much, is that it kind of shreds the previous movies (all three previous remakes) and does leave existential questions, like which version could be considered from this reality/universe/dimension/time etc...If either didn't/doesn't exist the whole Marvel franchise is out the window, or at least most of the movies does share some connections.What happened to the Stark inheritance? Happy's relation to Spider-man Peter Parker - That leave a lot of questions unanswered in my book.I haven't picked up a comic book in probably almost 3 decades now, so I don't know much what happened to aunt May since then, but back then I can't recall anything happening to her other than perhaps some sinister bad guys targeting her, but with a positive outcome.That should also count as what happens in the comic books should reflect on \"our\" multiverse-version of Spider-man, thus what major events happens in those should correspond with the movie. Not quite buying that outcome with aunt May's destiny.I will watch this movie again, that I'm sure of, as well as the rest of the other Marvel movies, maybe I can puzzle together some more answers, probably more questions too.", "Bland. Should've been animated, at best": "There is literally nothing original about this movie with exception of it having the 2 previous Spider-Men. Literally every major scene is a copy of the previous movies. I always thought Tom Holland couldn't hold his own and the movie would've tanked without the go of the previous Spider-Men..this movie proves it and also drags down every villain and hero portrayed. There were so many plot holesIt was very poorly written.Why would Dr. Strange so easily agree to Peter's request when he was so against it the previous movies??and something that could affect the timeline so significant for some odd reason.They ended the movie with Peter being left COMPLETELY alone. Literally no family...no friends...and literally wiped from everyone's memory.....They made the scene where MJ is falling and then caught by Andrew Spider-Man so bland. It ended so abruptly. It like even if she had fallen, she would've gotten a mild concussion, at best.The humor was weak.Why does Jamie Fox's character have a completely different personality? Its like they couldn't find his wig and was like \"yeah just be cool instead\".Why would sandman want to fight along side the green goblin even though he remembers Peter and only fought him to get help for his daughter?Its like the writers knew Tobey & Andrew were going to be in there said, \"yeah we don't really have to work for this one\". At best, this should've been an animated movie.", "The best Movie Ever!!": "There is not much to say, i was Fascinated surprised and it was just the best marvel movie ever. It exceeded all if my expectations. Must watch.So much going in in this movie it's absurd. It's 100% the best spidey and marvel movie of all time.", "It was amazing": "I totally loved it. In this movie we see our friendly neighborhood spider-man is finally growing in MCU. He has to sacrifice his relationship and friendship for universe. This movie was funny and included everything we have been waiting for. So enjoy the movie.", "wow....simply just WOW": "Just finished watching Spider- Man: No Way Home yesterday and it just blow my mind, the atmosphere in the Cinema is crazy and the hype is from beginning to end.Well done Marvel studios for this epic spider man movie of all generationsNote: If you are note a marvel geek don't leave the cinema early.. stick to the end of credits.", "Imagine if they kept everything g secret and out of the trailers.": "This movie would have blown people away with the reveals if they never showed or mentioned the villains return, which in itself also spoiled the obvious return of the previous 2 spidermen actors. But Sony needed people to fill the cinemas en mass. I don't blame them, but honestly would have been a better experience cw if we knew nothing.That being said, this is the greatest Spiderman movie of all time, even beating Spiderverse. It had everything and is easily one of the Best Mcu movies too. It's funny how the villains from Spiderman 1 & 2 are even better in NWH than the first movies, the acting was on another level. They even made electro (Jamie fox) a better villain. I wish there was a Miles Cameo, but can't ask for everything in such a epic movie.", "Great fun and super emotional": "Without giving spoilers this is a great close on Tom's Homecoming trilogy, Peter grows a lot by the end of the film and is shown what it really means to be spidey. The nostalgia with the villains is great too, all actors are great in their roles!", "Good - unbelievable premise": "The fight at the Statue of Liberty was very cool and the highlight of the movie along with all 3 spidey's meeting together was well done. It kind of bothers me that Dr. Strange would be so stupid in the first place to cast such a spell, so you really have to suspend belief(in a lot of areas) to let enjoy all the positives about the movie. A good one, but not great.", "A CELEBRATION of Spider-Man!!!!": "My SPOILER Review Spider-Man No Way Home!!!PROS:-This feels like a celebration of all the Spider-Man Films and I'm here for it!!!-For the first time I finally believed the romance between this Peter and MJ.-Dafoe solidifies himself as the BEST Spider-Man villain (again) and his performance between being Norman and the Goblin is amazing.-The Daredevil Cameo!-The banter between the villains in the prison is hilarious.-ANDREW and TOBEY returning is EVERYTHING!!!!-Seeing Tom, Andrew and Tobey all swinging into battle together was truly special!!!-Hearing the Elfman and Horner Scores was a nice touch.-Watching all of them swap their Spider-Man stories had the entire theater laughing.-The Final Battle between Peter and the Goblin was Vicious.-Peter's sacrifice and accepting his new life!CONS:-The Pacing is off in the first half of the film.This film is something special. Like I said at the top, it feels like a celebration of all the cinematic Spider-Man films. It's FULL of fan service, in a good way and in an earned way. This couldn't have been done like this without the other films before it and the script uses that to its benefit! The Entire 3rd Act is really something that could only happen now in this story. Dafoe stands out as the primary villain, but all of them get a moment to shine. Seeing Tobey and Andrew again as their respective Spider-Men, brought a smile to my face and cheers to the theater. But the film never loses its focus on MCU Peter. Tom Holland finally makes his Peter Parker his own. I feel like this is the beginning of a new iteration of his Peter Parker and I can't wait to see what's next! 8/10.", "A teen drama with better VFX.": "The movie never had a real plot to it. Just the idea of bringing all the actors who played Spiderman before. And some teen drama between Zendaya and Tom Holland.", "Terrible jokes, horrible plot": "Am I the only one?Omg the jokes were so lame like a kids TV show. And the plot - let's keep all the villains here while they kill my aunt. Jesus\nDidn't get the hype of the movie. Some cool action scenes but just coudn't pass the time.", "Perfect!": "This movie is just perfect, Just perfect, Deserves 10 stars. This movie gave my so much emotions, It made me so happy yet so sad, Best film of the franchise.", "First movie I haven't slept through in a while": "Good story. Was hoping there would be more monsters from Dr strange tearing the universe at the end though. However, this was a brilliant movie! Go see the movie... NOW!", "A true gift for all the spidey-fans": "Went into the theatre expecting a huge nostalgia trip, taking me back to my childhood spidey-movies , and it was exactly that and better.The story is just an instrument that moves our favorite characters in a beautyful picture, with an exceptional soundtrack.The acting and the comedy was great, and Jon Watts has closed this trilogy with his best movie to date.", "Best Marvel Movie?": "This is the greatest marvel movie I have ever seen. I loved every second of it. The beginning was a little slow but it picked up pace later in the film. The fight with Doctor Strange was very trippy but excellent. When Andrew and Tobey showed up it brought back so many childhood memories. When May died I almost cried but didn't thankfully. When all 3 spidermen bonded I felt a feeling I couldn't describe. And don't even get me started on when Andrew caught MJ. The chemistry between Tom Tobey and Andrew was great. All of the villains preformed excellent as well. Andrew is a great actor and the ASM1 and 2 didn't do him justice, but this film did. I do think that this film felt like a fan service but so was Endgame, and they both are great. This film was incredible and I can't wait to see what comes next. (SpiderMan 4 and ASM3?)", "FUNNY GOOD STORY FOR KIDS": "I don't know why people give this movie 10 /10 . What IS the story of the movie. Spider-Man did the mistake because of which all the villain came . Then he start defending. So called protector of world. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENING TODAY'S . AMERICA DID ALL THE PROBLEM LIKE GLOBAL POLUTION , MAKING TALIBAN, CREATING PROBLEM FOR THE WORLD AND PRETEND TO BE AS A SUPERHERO BY TAKING SO CALLED ACTION AGAINST THAM . LOL SUPER POWER country AND SUPER HERO.", "Amazing and spectacular, but still the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man": "If you like movies and are not Martin Scorsese, do yourself a favor: GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW! Don't get spoiled by social media, news articles or your so called friends, or by reading reviews like this one, but see and experience this one as soon as possible. DO IT!Because this is the best Spider-Man movie of all time, and it amazingly can be compared to such massive MCU classics like Infinity War and Endgame, and it definitely is the best 4th phase MCU movie/series. Let me tell you why (contains spoilers).\"I am all the Jedi\", said someone in one of the other popular franchises. Well, here, they bring together all the Spider-Men from 2000's cinema. And boy, oh boy do they deliver. Tobey is back, Andrew is back, and they both are ridiculously good and are given ridiculously good lines and action. Andy G rather surprisingly(?) steals the show the most. So much mushy love around the three spideys, that you will need tissues or cybernetic retinal not to weep your eyes out.The old villains are back, with a vengeance, and better that ever. Doc Oc, Electro, Sandman, Lizard and Green Goblin. Especially the Willem Dafoe chews every scene he is in.If the old cast shines, so does Tom Holland, Zendaya, Jacob Batalon and Cumberbatch. Holland has to use all of his range of emotions, and does it very well. Holland's Peter Parker finally has to go through his Uncle Ben -moment and rise again to become a real Spider-Man.The amount of fan service in No Way Home is uncountable. It's so full of easter eggs that I fear the next Easter is cancelled, because Feige and co. Used them all. But thanks!Cinematically Jon Watts gives us the most beautifully shot and staged Marvel-show thus far. Even if most of the vistas presented are probably generated in a nerdy basement, the composition and use of angles and camera is masterful both in quieter and action-full scenes.The movie makes you laugh, gasp, cheer, weep and just watch in awe. What an achievement, after numerous superhero movies they can still pull this off. And its not Stark and MCU they rely on, its Spider-Man lore where this movie finds its strenghts.And yeah, stay for the two end-credit scenes.", "Best spider Man movie ever": "I watched this movie in theaters with my friends and I am telling you honestly that this is MIND-BLOWING\nIf you are a spider man fan then it is a perf ct masterpiece for you\nActing =10/10\nAction 100/10\nEmotional touch 10/10\nThriller=10/10.", "One of Marvel's best.

Marvel movies are never bad and in this case, this is one of the hands down coolest movies I've ever seen.", "Marvel's gift to the comic fans. An incredible achievement": "What an incredible achievement this movie is. Exhilerating and entertaining 2:30 hours. This movie is for a true comic book fans, especially those of Spider Man and Marvel comics. Tom Holland, brilliantly donning the Spidey mask again appearing more unprepared and learning to be a responsible Spider Man in the way with the help of MJ(terrific Zendaya) and Ned and additional help from Dr. Strange himself. Sinister 5 portrayed by original actors gives you joy and nostalgia every second of their appearance this time with an additional secret seasoning from Watts. Best of the lot is Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin who seemed to have enjoyed the role as much he did in the first movie. Goblin is more sinister and terrifying this time and Dafoe just aced it. The time you get to see what we have been waiting all along,just gives you pure joy. There were gut punching scenes as well when the loss of a beloved character and the teary good byes of the trio. But end of the day, you walk out the movie wanting to watch again and again and rejoice the spectacle.Thank you Marvel for this.", "Esref Efe Durgut": "In one word it was perfect! It was the 2nd best Marvel movie I've seen, maybe the best! Definitely watch it! It was an excellent movie in every way... neither funny nor sad.

The most enjoyable spider man experience that is definitely top tier marvel. While not without some flaws (some slightly dodgy CGI) the film is gripping throughout, fun, funny and equal parts heartwarming and heart-wrenching. The ending sets up a future for spider man that I can't wait to watch.", "Marvel's Masterpiece": "Yes Even with there is Avengers Infinity War & Endgame, I call this one Marvel's Masterpiece. They did this one brilliantly and perfectly. They exceeded all of our expectations and made every fan's dream come true. This is the best Spider-Man ever made and definitely on the same level of Avenger's infinity war and endgame. My only fear that this might be the last Marvel's greatest movie ever made cause I really doubt they can top that one. I loved every second of it and THANK YOU MARVEL for that one.", "The less you know the better": "Spider-Man No Way Home does the seemingly impossible by getting exponentially better with each movie. It's definitely the best movie theater experience I've had since The Matrix in 1999. It's shockingly almost as mind-blowing as the original Matrix, but in a wonderfully different way.Going in blind is the way to go. Stop reading reviews, stop reading anything about it, don't watch the trailer if you haven't already because going blind is unequivocally the best way to experience this masterpiece.", "It was great.. but just because of the nostalgia elements": "The story was... so so. Not bad just the typical superhero movies you know.They had so many characters and we know what happened w eternals too.The dialog felt blant too at some point. The humor was just not on point.But I like the surprises they gave us, either its the villains, spidermen, and showing us matt murdock.I know it's tom holland's spidey so it will focused on that so it's okay.I liked how they placed Tom's Spidey's like that because its necessary if they want to do more with Sony new trilogy amd their Spiderman universe therebut still, the story is not amazing for me.", "Exceptional": "Best of the best.

I just can't any ore with all the fan boys rushing to leave 10 star reviews or destroy a movie they feel hurt them in some way.This one is a kids movie. No real stakes, not a villain that creates any sort of fear, nothing remarkable besides a couple of scenes that by now are probably known .If you are expecting some avengers type of awesomeness, that is by no means that. You will be dissapointed.If you want to catch this movie with your kids or because you have nothing better to do then sure.

And speaking of Tom, he came along way, from kid in Civil War who doesn't care about his actions. To a man that holding big power and gives him too a big responsibility.

Just amazing, MUST WATCH.", "Oh my god, what did I just watch???": "*** SPOILER ALERT ***I don't even know where to start from... this must be one of the most pathetic, politically correct, do-gooders, millennial movies I've ever seen...

Stay through the full credits on this.", "It was fun": "If I was ten years younger I probably would have ranked higher but I think marvel is doing too much with these movies. Was cool to see Tony McGuire in it since I grew up on that spider man. All in all was fun and some cool action scenes but I wouldn't watch again. It is worth seeing once though.", "What a fantastic movie!": "This movie is everything I wanted from Tom Holland's Spider-man. I was not a huge fan of Homecoming and FFH. But now all those make sense. Director Jon Watts just built up the character for this amazing movie. Watch those 2 movies after watching No way home. That will completely change your mind.This movie almost feels like the origin movie of the MCU Spidey. It's not an ending,It's just another beginning.The way they use Spider sense in this movie is absolutely beautiful. This is an emotional ride. This is a love letter for all the Spidey fans out there. I wish it could be atleast 3 hours long.Willem Dafoe's performance is perfect in this movie. He steals the movie after the first half. Also man!, Tom Holland is nailing his performance.

I think I'm going to like your Spider-Man from now on...! That was some righteous insane!!! \ud83d\udcaf", "Marvel's most lapidated work": "This is the ultimate Marvel movie, after years refining its formula. The winnings starts with the film being the immediate sequence of one of the most well constructed storylines of the franchise. Without the good script of Far From Home, this movie wouldn't be possible. They are complementary pieces as two halves of an orange - and as all the MCU should be.After this victory, the movie starts having its own merits (and also demerits). The thing that annoyed me the most was the kiddish behavior of Disney's Peter Parker and how it affects his surrounding and other lifes because of his stubbornness and stupid attitudes. One time over it and we can enjoy the movie and it's consequences.The first moment that amazed me was the dialogue between all the villains when they were trapped together. In this moment the MCU forget itself and remembered the past, not for mere nostalgy or to cite a reference - but to construct a new history. For all the children that grew up watching the other spider man, it doesn't seem like we are watching more of the same, but the continuity of it's characters plot.Then we got something that was really surprising and that every heroes' movie deserve: a true villain, in this movie played by the Green Goblin. The reboot of this character into a super evil unstoppable psychopath really fitted in and made sense for the script, distancing from the other \"enemies\" that looked more like \"lost persons with sad backgrounds\". But this distance is essential to construct what this characters are there for. The only thing I couldn't understand was how the Green Goblin became so strong. The acting of Willem Dafoe is incredible and really disturbing as it should be (I wont forget his face smiling while getting beaten for a long time, and would like to have seen it more in the movie's ending.)\nAunt May's death was the saddest moment according to all the public's reaction in the session I was, but for me the great achievement of its scene was 1) giving value to MJ's falling scene and 2) constructing the future Peter Parker. Will speak of both later.The appearance of the other Peter Parkers was in a perfect moment and very well done. Just got me disappointed because the first appearance was of Andrew Garfield, instead of Tobey Maguire. The characters of Zendaya and Jacob Batalon are rocking in this movie.The final battle made sense, gave good moments between the trio and the action scene was greatly made. I could follow it perfectly, as in some movies I just can't pay attention because of the quantity of cuts, explosions and things happening at the same time. The idea that the villains could be saved was a perfect purpose for the triplet to fight together. But even with this plan, Tom Holland's character crossed the line while hitting Harry Osborn, even after having\nthis very clear and with the lesson gave by aunt May and a lot of talk with the more experienced spiders. For me, this doesn't fitted in. MJ's being saved shivered me because they constructed it like the worst could happen. And it was an opportunity of redemption, of making things right, different from the past. This scene was beautiful.The conclusion of the battle was very satisfactory, and the decision to erase Peter from every memory was the decision that should have been taken since the beginning of the film (or this, or doesn't play with the universe, but if doing something, do it right). But the best part of the consequence of this story is that Disney's Peter Parker (that have never had his proper initiation, since his first appearance was in the middle of a fight and his first solo movie is a very disposable one) will have now the chance to construct his own history. The crown has been passed. The old franchises are well resolved. Everybody forgot who is Peter Parker - and he is totally by his own. Time to restart.(Plus: the post-credit scene was a genius act of MCU's finishing to swallow all of the spider-man related movies into its universe. With that, Disney could finally been related with all the other movies - and saved a lot by doesn't having to introduce some elements that other companies had the effort to. I could see the webs connecting it all.)", "Just a filler movie": "Why didn't Peter ask Doctor Strange to make the world forget about Mysterio? Why didn't Doctor Strange clarify his spell more clearly to Peter before hand? Everyone is beyond clueless and immature in this film and if this is the future of cinema then oh boy- this was clearly made to get as much as they can out of this franchise until it's milked dry.", "Words can't even describe the happiness this movie gave": "I wish I could give it more then 10 stars to be honest, it was an amazing movie that pulled on emotions, nostalgia and more. Can't wait to see it again and again.", "Not he best spider movie. But by far the best experience": "With the best ending of any super hero movie, No Way Home gives to the fans everything we want.Im just sad Tobey didnt have more screentime with Ned, MJ and even Tom.Really wanted to see what happen to Tobey and Andrew after their movies.This movie could have adress that.Sony release the 3 h version of the movie.", "The best spider-man movie in the last 18 years!": "It was awesome. The best spider-man movie in the last 18 years! I loved it so much and it was so emotional. I am hoping for a new spider-man 4 movie in the last three years!", "Reminiscent Elements": "The idea of having more than 1 villain in a movie has been refuted in the past, (Spiderman - 3), calling it loaded. But this movie brought it home with the original cast back at it once again. The trio was definitely something all of us were anticipating. I particularly loved how they subtly introduced Daredevil in it as well, hinting to a marvel's defenders inclusion in the near future. The mix of comedy, action and emotion was brilliantly portrayed, reflecting both terrible and selfless decisions that a teenager takes for the fate of the world. Loved it through and through.", "It's Already Been Done": "Honestly don't know why everyone loves this movie. It's essentially a botched live action Into The Spiderverse. The only thing it had going for it was the 'multiverse' concept, but it's already been done and way better. The action was forgettable and the plot childish. You could say it's fitting since Spider-Man's a high schooler, but for everyone around him to not only allow but assist in his naivety is ridiculous.It's cool they brought the original actors back, but they forgot to make a movie.", "Best of the Spiderman series": "I think that this was one of the best of the entire MCU movies.

I write in the title that I subtract 2 stars from my rating, the reasons be that this whole mess which became this movie was the protagonist's fault for being... too much of who he is and because the movie lost a great chance to introduce us to new character(s) like Miles Morales and/or Gwen Stacy.That being said, the movie that came out of his mess was amazing! The action, the fun, the drama, the past we loved or loved to hate, they were all in there. And left us with the even greater prospect of how are they going to use the symbiote in the next one of this amazing hero's live action relaunch that Jon Watts and (I hate to admit it) Disney gifted us.", "Good movie, but can see it made for much younger audience!": "There is too much goofing around, and too much focusing on the ''teenager'' aspect.And it's merges Avengers/Time travel with previous Spiderman movies and previous Spiderman actors.Heard many in the cinema where like, who is that guys, wait what, 3 spidermans, but who are they though?I mean if this movie where to focus on younger audience, you shouldn't include stories from previous Spiderman..\nGreat to see Tobey Maguire and previous villains again, but Tobey felt too much pushed to act teenager and in a teenager mindset just for this film.", "Good but nostalgia driven": "I will start by saying overall I enjoyed the film and the cinema experience the best for any film I've seen.The concept was interesting but I found the story lacking. Some parts of the film dragged on too long, others felt too short. Definitely an emotional film but that is more to do with nostalgia for what came before than what we received this time. The film was messy in areas and alot did not make sense.

I am looking forward to what future installments have to deliver with their Spider-Verse in the MCU.", "Fan Service Overdone": "The story while entertaining is simply complete fan service which while not being inherently bad on its own can feel cheap if it comes at you from every corner, a problem especially prevalent throughout the full film yet especially distracting in the third act. Tobey Maguire delivers his classic loveable charm from the Raimi Trilogy yet Andrew Garfield couldn't be anymore different from his Amazing Spider-Man films which shouldn't be a problem unless you are doing pure fan service which this film is. The film also brings big plot holes regarding how the villians arcs were in there previous films and just how they arrived but otherwise Dafoe and Molina give great and entertaining performances and are definitely a highlight of not just there own respective Spider-Man films but also this one. If you loved the Raimi Trilogy you'll love this but if you even slightly enjoy cinema then this is just a mediocre attempt at grabbing cash.", "A true delight": "There is never a dull moment in this MCU masterpiece and it is all thanks to the absolute flawless performance by Holland.

This is a young superhero who obviously does not learn from previous mistakes, even though the adults around him try very hard to show him patience and trustworthiness and give him credit for some maturity and intelligence. But some superpowers do not come with common sense because that alone is its own superpower. Evil is rarely changed by good; evil people will rarely be shown the error of their ways by good example! DUH. But Peter can always be canned on to make things worse before he makes things better...just...really???", "Delivers on all expectations!": "I was very scared that I would be disappointed - but this film delivered in every single way!

Brought back some faces from the past but in an arguably original way. Didn't feel like a re hash of old ideas. There is how ever a few plot holes.Mainly being ( S P O I L E R A L E R T) how at the end everyone forgets who peter parker is, including his gf and best friend. Don't they wonder who this guy named Peter is in their contacts list on their phone? All the calls and texts to this now forgotten man? They don't find it weird? Or how about the news reel footage of him being unmasked and named? No one pulled up and old clip of say, I don't know from like 3 days ago where they're shouting his name to the heaves and put it on every news paper? Did all the news paper disappear too? Or just the headline with his name? What took its place if so? Nothing, just a blank page? And the cherry on top at the end to me is how the heck did a 17 year old kid with no job get a 1 bedroom apartment in New York city on his own? He even says he's broke at one point in the movie lol, I guess old Tony with his trillions couldn't have spared him a cent in his will lol.All and all I guess I'm just happy they didn't make it into some woke-topian hellscape with a trans Peter swinging around in a rainbow suit.

It wasn't bad before that, it is very competently done, but I was getting more and more annoyed, how could Peter be so wreckless? But like I said, what happened next - I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING! Yes, that elevated it, up to perhaps the most enjoyable movie in the entire Marvel catalogue. Maybe not quite, but yes, it confirmed what for many of us has always been the case: Spider-Man/Peter Parker is the most relatable, the one you root for, the one who wears his heart upon his sleeve, the kid who won't stay down.

The characters of this movie are so brainless that you expect them to have suffered some form of brain damage.So, the plot brain waves are a complete flat line. But hey! Action scenes are fun, and they've found a way to recycle actors and characters from other Spider-man movies! Isn't it that great that they make old people work again, after 10-20 years from their last Spider-man movie?TLDR: Plot looks like written by a chimpanzee, fun action scenes, and recycled actors from old Spider-man movies.

MARVEL could not have given a better Christmas gift.", "My Scorecard (7.7)": "The movie was pretty average but it featured the presence of so many past heroes and villains. Disney knows how to do fan service but, as their previous works on the Marvel franchise, there are little plot holes scattered inside the story, some incinsistencies or logical failures that i expected in a film made for grown teenagers.Flaws:\nThe thing that a spell could erase the memory of peter parker even in machines is a bit stupid. Like, if i have some video on my hard disk that shows spiderman taking off his mask, i still would associate the spiderman character with the face of that boy.It wasn't explained why tom holland hasn't got the nanomachines spiderman suit at end of the film, and it seemed like he literally sewn a new one made of cloth inside his new apartment for no reason at all.The thing that Venom didn't completely return to another dimension is a bit of a stretch put there only to be able to continue the venom movies.Overall this was one of the best films of the MCU, comparable to 'Infinity War' or 'Endgame', and from CGI to stage presence, it had them all._____________________________________________SCORECARDIn a range from 1 to 5, i'll give a value to each entry written below.

They do know how to balanced everything where they balanced the humor, the emotions and nostalgia characters. This is another great example of what fan service movie should look like. The weak point of the film is the way they use Dr. Strange was lazy and cheap and it makes the setup felt cheap and mediocre, lots of unanswered questions about the spell and some weird editing choices, which I can forgive them for that as long as they gave me satisfying pay off and after I walked out of the theater it put me a grin on my face.

PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOURE WANTING THE FULL MOVIE EXPERIENCE TO FORM YOURE OWN OPINION:I left the theatre in tears, but not the happy kind. Understandably seeing the 3 main cinamatic spidermen I've grown up with along side the best bad guys from the many spiderman movies together brought alot of fan service and excitement in the scenes they shared. This excitement turned to anticipation and then quickly terned to disappointment when I realised this was the main pay-off of the movie. I was so sure there would be more but once I got past this i realised the movie was so full of poor pacing an ending that tries to be deep but back tracks on everything else we've seen from the MCU. Understand that the ending doesn't work not because spiderman got a poordeal but because it felt so out of touch with everything I've learnt through watching the MCU.Firstly I hated the \"just coz\" mentality of the science in this movie. Yes mavel does it all the time but never to this extent. The whooooole movie was \"just coz\" with no attempt at any kind of reasonable explanation to suspend belief. I dont accept that just because spiderman wanted to cure them all that there's some magic cure to a guy litarally made out of sand. I don't except that electro just magically came out looking like Jamie with a new personality and I should just run with it because the characters are also surprised (yes I understand that there was talk about the electricity working different, but come on, realy?). Why did lizard basically do nothing the whole movie? Doc ocs tech was so easily controlled remotely it makes me question why Peter never used this to an advantage outside of his costume, he seamed to know what he was doing straight away once it happened. Sandmans motives where pure garbage. He should know better that spiderman is a better choice to allign with than the others. He litarally had nothing to lose. He ether gets cured and goes back or he just goes back later. The other villains weren't even trying to get the box to go home which is exactly the opposite of what he wanted. Also why cant he look like a normal human like in the original movie. He's stuck looking like a pile of sand the whole movie, contradicting the original which left me confused when he did get cured at the end and he looked normal. Was it to not spoil the original actor comming back? Come on.I would also like to ask \"why isn't peter allowed a happy ending?\". I get that not every movie has to be happy and spiderman has had alot of sad endings through comic and movie history but it made no sence the way they did it in the context of the MCU. The way I understood it, because it was very much show dont tell (which I actually appreciated) Is because he wants to protect his loved ones he doesn't tell them who he really is. Sorry but Iron man managed just fine. IRON MAN, the guy Peter looked up to more than anyone and still references when he's feeling insecure or unsure of himself. Iron Man had a wife, a child and then chose to make the sacrifice for their and the worlds benefit. Iron man is litarally the poster boy for do what you want. His identity was litarally on public display and aside from the time he provoked a terrorist he lived a relatively normal life with his family, who again understood what it ment to be the family of Iron Man. I get that Peter is ment to be \"better\" than Iron man as quoted in homecoming but you can't show Iron man with his loving family and a daughter who now has a future (its tragic he's dead but his family goes on right?) and expect me not to wonder what made Tony different. It's not like it was pepper and his child that died. As far as I can tell their gonna be apart of the next phase of marvel. So again, why can't Peter be happy? PLENTY of superheroes in the MCU have friends shong chi is litarally bumbing around with his best friend the whole of the 10 rings movie and even brings her with him at the end. Again I've got no issues with the movie ending sad but it just felt un justified.The absolute biggest disappointment to me though, more than anything the movie did was the handling of the \"spoilers\". Marvel really can't handle that Toby and Andrew got spoiled months before the release of the movie and through interviews and statement it felt like we really hadn't seen everything and we could expect some surprises throughout the movie. Aside from Daredevil who I expected thanks to the Hawkeye show there was nothing that shocked me. I fully went into this movie expecting Toby and Andrew thanks to the trailers and leaks from months ago and in all honestly how could I not expect them when the classic Villains are back and Andrew Garfield couldn't keep a straight face in any interview. They also dangled the expectations of the sinister six in front of everyone. There was not a single person who wasn't excited for this. They showed 5 bad guys in the trailers which is weird if you'd wanna keep something a surprise so it was pretty much expected that the sixth Villains would be kept a secret buuuuuut nope. They dangled it and there were only 5 which they showed in the trailer. I felt like an idiot waiting for this last villain to just show up but it never happened. Marvel tried to subvert expectations but it only really works when what you get is somewhat comparable in the enjoyment of what was expected.I really expected more from the way this movie was promoted. There is litarally an interview with the three leads where they get asked \"people feel they've seen everything thanks to the trailers, what do you think?\" And they respond as if there's this amazing thing that they've kept secret and no one could possibly picture where they're going with this. But there wasn't. The trailers really did give everything away.What was up with venom? Was he just there to further fill seats. I remember watching the end credits to the carnage movie and getting so excited just to end up with a second after credit scene that looks like its heading the right direction just to have him go back to his reality and leve behind a bit of venom for someone other than Tom hardy to pick up and use. That just felt like the last slap in the face after just being disappointed. They hinted at alot more than what they deliverd and I think that was one of my biggest issue with this movie. If Andrew and Toby got spoilt just leave it at that and move on but dont start dodging questions and making us think there's more there when there isn't. But even then I cant say the story was anything great. Just characters not acting right and doing things to progress the story. Some strange pacing at times, not alot of witty dialogue from spideman considering that's kinda his main thing while in the suite and thus was made worse considering there was three of them. I can't say much for how doctor strange was acting as I dont know a huge amount about him but for sure that was a completely different character to the strange we've seen in the MCU and he's acting more like his old full of himself doctor Steven strange personality. Just outta nowhere to make the movie work I guess.Spite all I've said there were aspects of the movie I enjoyed. The interaction with the three spidermen was always gonna make me happy. It was great seeing how they reacted to one another and there dialogue out of costume was pretty good. I also think green goblin was nicely fleshed out with an amazing performance by Willem Dafoe, highlighting the split personality of Norman Osborne.Ill conclued with with some simple comments in list form:\n-May dying was a nice change of pace and I think that was a nice character moment which he needed to be able to relate to Andrew and Toby's spidermen.-Some of the quotes said by the villains to pay omage to their original performances was a nice touch of fan service (maybe overboard sometimes but I thought it was nice).-I liked that they gave Andrew some redemption-I really liked that they didn't just say everything that was happening. Like why Andrew was crying when he caught MJ from falling. Doesn't need to be explained, the fans understand.-The story leaves alot to be desired and the ending just felt like a way to set up for future movies but wasn't justified.-I felt like Marvel subverted expectations in the wrong way (who wants to see the sinister 5?, defeats the purpose of even having that many villains).-they gave away everything I the trailers. No surprise villains and even the people bot confirmed might as well have been.-I understand there are more spiderman movies comming out and most likely spiderman will get his happy ending eventually but after all the teasing, promotion and looking back on it now with hind sight, litarally everything had already been spoiled and Marvel tried to convince everyone there was more to see.Conclusion: It really did come down to how many people they could get in those seats. They presented a fan service film that deliverd on nostalgia but really not much else. I just cant see this as a good movie purely based on nostalgia.

EVERY SINGLE THEATER I came across upon was already booked/filled to capacity until managed to find a theater with enough space for me & some friends to FINALLY reserve.However, even after all that, I could definitely see why that was the case, hence my money was well spent!!!I got to see 2 1/2 hrs of pure talent, hard work, & dedication put into this major motion picture, not only for the many anxious moviegoers out there, but also for the die-hard marvel fans who grew up on Stan Lee & Steve Ditko's idea of a superhero who may have incredible strength, stamina, power, & intelligence but also one who is also considerate, funny, & even stubborn at times. Besides, as he evolves, whether from a high-school kid to a college student or from the friendly-neighborhood vigilante to a superhero inspiration, you can't help but feel more connected/relatable to Peter Parker than any other A-list MCU Superhero out there.All-in-all, DO NOT MISS THIS IN THEATERS!!!P.

It was refreshing to see a superhero movie with a great focus on personal relationships and inner conflict, making the movie relatable and emotional. It combines that with Marvel's typical awesome epic fight scenes and CGI.However, this movie does also suffer from many typical MCU movie issues. The most glaring problem is its misplaced humor that breaks all seriousness and tension. It's common for characters to be in a life-and-death situations and crack jokes. Why...? It's as though the writers were to afraid to fully embrace their own story.I will say, though, that when humor was used in the right places, it was hilarious.And when this movie does take itself seriously, when it wasn't afraid to stray away from the superhero movie formula, it was phenomenal and moving.I would definitely recommend watching Spider-Man: No Way Home in theaters.", "Weaker script but lots of enjoyment factor": "My two issue with Spider-Man: No Way Home were:\n1.

If you didn't like Spider-Man you would enjoy this movie but if you love Spider-Man you will go nuts.", "The Pinnacle Of Spider-man": "Hilarious, emotional and exhilarating, this movie was an absolute pleasure to watch from beginning to end. Jon Watts directs what will surely become one of the most celebrated Marvel films ever to be put to picture with a story that will have fans, of old and new, gushing over all of the returning characters to this universe bringing an almost Captain America: Civil War feel to the grandness of this movie. The entire cast is exceptional in this film with every single character reprising their original roles all the way back from the first spider-man starring Toby Maguire in 2002. Unlike some movies where reintroducing old characters can seemed forced and unnatural Spider-man: No Way Home flawlessly integrates these characters into a universe that has been built to make such a story feel possible if not inevitable. Endless jokes are sprinkled through almost every scene surrounded by dialogue that is consistent of past marvel productions with most of the punchlines and awkward silence gags hitting the mark. Visually we endure a pummeling of well executed action scenes with there also being dozens of well placed easter eggs to keep your eyes open for. This movie feels a little longer then the 2hr 20 min runtime to me but not necessarily in a bad way. The pacing of the movie was well crafted and the balance of humor and real hard hitting drama sucks you into the metaverse with Peter Parker for an adventure of massive proportions. Unfortunately the final battle scene felt a little underwhelming and slightly less polished then the rest of the films story building however the ending does a fantastic job of wrapping the film up in a way that hits you right in the feels.Overall I believe this to be one of the most impactful and important Marvel release's to date. It is a a step back in some ways from the dramatic space adventures we have experienced for the past decade and a jump into an environment that is grounded in the uncertainties of young adulthood. This movie will bust your gut, make you cry your eyes out and leave your jaw glued to the floor from the beginning to the end.", "Just a note": "Relativity of spidermans in their movies made this movie was planned in years!!Nothing else to tell yall, but i really recommend this movie to watch, brings up multiple emotions to this movie, enjoy!!", "All three swinging": "I loved how old three swinged it was so hyped and it was sad movie but the most imortant that tobey and andrew is in it thems entry scene was so hyped.

The movie is serious, funny, emotional.. and lot of amazing things...", "Not A Clockwork Orange": "I thought No Way Home was a fun movie with an interesting storyline. I especially enjoyed seeing the last three Spider-Mans (Spider-Men?) together. The film was a little bit heavy on the CGI for my tastes (I guess I prefer \"real\" people acting). The standout performance certainly came from Willem DaFoe, who's still got IT in his mid sixties and continues to play an amazing villain.Later, as I was thinking about the movie, I considered the part of the plot line which suggests that rather than killing the bad guys, that they could be cured of their \"badness.\" Though the words or \"shot\" or \"injection\" or \"vaccine\" were never used in the story, it was clear that some sort of inoculation was administered so that each villain could become \"good.\" Of course, as in any action movie, each villain in had to be beaten into submission before the injection could be administered, or else the villain was given the shot forcibly.I'm sure that this idea of a \"cure\" in the movie was inserted purposefully and was maybe a not so subtle commentary on society today. This aspect of the movie made me wonder . . . . Are the ones in charge of this piece of entertainment suggesting that it would be a good idea for those who are deemed \"bad,\" to be either beaten into submission or forced into accepting a \"cure\"? Though I don't want to believe that everything, including simple entertainment, is politicized, the message seemed pretty clear to me. The irony of this message is that it seems to be a complete 180 degree philosophical turn by the same film industry that brought us A Clockwork Orange a just a few (fifty) years ago.Maybe I'm overanalyzing a simple piece of entertainment, and should just stop thinking and enjoy Willem Defoe's performance . . .", "Spider Man should now grow up": "Why do you have to make bad decisions and then have to correct it in this way.

At a certain point Jamie electrocuted Molina after he got a new chip, I was worried they were going to revert him back to villainy only for him to pull in at the end.

Sorry but this wasn't at all what I hoped for and frankly the high review score made me expect so much more than this...I had avoided the trailers and leaks prior to watching it a couple days ago with the kids so I didn't know much more than some of the actors that was going to return to old characters, but I was expecting more cameos than what was showed on the silver screen?!I'm not going to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it yet but was it really necessary to kill you know who?And Dr. Strange all of a sudden with a completely different persona? We were 100% sure it wasn't him at all initially but we were wrong. Sadly. And the ending was by far the worst one in any of these later Marvel movies simply because it undid EVERYTHING the previous Tom Holland Spider-Man movies had accomplished... And why does every Marvel movie nowadays have be so extremely sad...? Why can't we go home feeling happy, filled with joy and awesome after watching the movie instead of like now, going home feeling sad and empty, and wondering why they destroyed everything great that we the audience came to love about the latest incarnation of Spider-Man?We were all disappointed about the latter half and it's such a shame because Spider-Man was important to the whole saga since he's the only one still being a normal person! Ant-Man sort of fits the description too, but here we have a teenager doing teenager stuff and that's why it turned out so great with Tom Holland being said teenager!I hope there are no more Spider-Man instalments because I just can't see them going anywhere from this apart from even further south... :(If you are going to watch this then make sure to bring plenty of tissue paper because you will cry. A lot. And you will not feel uplifted and joyful when done. Even if you're not as disappointed as we were you will feel sad and wishing things didn't unfold like they did.Such a shame because to me Spider-Man really was the replacement Iron Man!", "A dream comes true": "Watching no way home was like living a dream, no way home is the darkest spider-man movie ever made, tom holland was at his best in nwh which is the best movie out of the home trilogy, i am really excited for the upcoming spider man movies.", "Best movie made this year.": "This movie is so far the best Spider-Man movie ever created you could really see how much effort work and time they had put into this , this movie is very exciting emotional and memorable I will never forget this movie and I can't stop thinking about it ever since I saw it. I would say yes I did cry a lot when peters aunt died and they all rushed and gave him a hug than they all started crying together that literally broke me. That movie is a movie I will never forget. Tom holland is one of the best Spider-Man's to ever exist like omggg. I'm so happy he can still make 3 more movies and I'm so excited for a new one to come out. Even tho they still haven't confirmed anything yet I'm still so excited and can't wait to see more of this. And I hope Peter gets all of his friends back if they do make a new one because he deserves it. I hope he gets his MJ back and Ned ofc. (Anyway ya please don't read this if you have not seen the movie yet I spoiled a lot of the movie lol.)", "There was no sense of the fight in the movie.": "I watched the movie just because of tobey Maguire. There is no comparison between spider man 1,2,3 vs tom Holland's spider man. Yeah acting was good but there was no sense of the fight. It was just forcefully. 1st time villains are good and next minute they become bad and next minute they again become good. Script was so poor.", "Such a bad and STUPID story": "SPOILER ALERT! Am i only one who doesn't like Spider-Man: No Way Home? I like all the actors and actresses. My problem is with the really bad story. Let me explain. Peter has a problem because everyone know who spiderman is. He asks Dr. Strange for help. Strange cast a spell so everyone forget who spiderman is. Peter STUPIDLY asks to change the spell 6 times knowing that it s really dangerous to change it in mid casting. Dr. Strange agrees and changes it. Spell goes wrong and couple of interesting people who are about to die in other parallel universes come to our world.Peter STUPIDLY changes the timeline by saving those couple of people and get Aunty May killed in the process. (Changing timelines are bad. Everyone knows that) After all that trouble Peter goes back to the original solution. Which was to make everyone forget he is the spider man. This story is so STUPID. And the there is no progression at all in the movie. They came to the same solution they had in the 1st place and we are back at zero where no one knows who spiderman is.Superhero movies were all about saving humanity and giving people hope. Nowadays they create problems that they try solve and getting killed thousands in the process. PS: Dr. Strange next movie (dr strange multiverse of madness) teaser shows that spell going wrong has a much larger effect on the entire universe and the world is coming to and end. Which again a problem they created. Can't they write a better story?", "Love the movie for what it represents not what it is": "I don't know what to think of this movie.I love it for what it represents, and I really enjoyed myself in the theater, but after the movie, after calming down I started to see it's flaws.The movie is great, it's undeniably the best of the Holland trilogy. And that last scene really gives me hope for the future of Spider-Man in the MCU, he even might become the best Spidey adaptation ever. But everything thing else in the movie was kinda meh.Let me explain.First of all the way the spell worked and the villain's motivations. So apparently people who knew Peter Parker is Spider-Man were coming thru, ok but why only villains and Spider-Men? Harry and MJ knew in the Raimi trilogy. Same for Gwen in the ASM. And I get it maybe it would do a lot of characters for a single movie, or they might not be very interesting characters to work with in the crossover, but what about Captain Stacy? Imagine Andrew's Peter facing his dead girlfriend's dad knowing he couldn't keep his promise of keeping her safe? It could be interesting.Or Osborn that now wants to stay in this universe but also wants to avenge the dead of his son, or the opposite, Harry working with the Spidey's against his dad even knowing it means the death of both because it's the right thing to do. That would be AMAZING to see.Imagine a fight with the Lizard in the sewers at night catching Tom's Peter totally of guard, no because he is bad and wants to try to make his plan work again, cause he already had his redemption arc but because he just wants a second chance and doesn't want to finish his life in prison in his own world.I don't have a problem with electro I think he's ok. We're I REALLY REALLY have an issue is with Sandman. Because it doesn't make any sense. He had a whole talk with Electro and the other villains about why we WANTED to return home to his daughter, and the others clearly said they wanted to destroy the box because they wanted to stay, so why, with no freaking explanation he sides with the villains instead of helping the good guys who wanted to help him go home? It's just the biggest plot hole in the movie and it's driving me insane. If he can't be in the good side just don't put him in the movie.But that's it for the villains. (I think) Now let's get to the Peters themselves.First of all why? Just why making they're first appearance in the movie look like a random sitcom? Why do they just enter portals like nothing happened and they're cool with it and they joking around with MJ and Ned? Who thought it was a good idea?Why not make their appearance during a fight? Or even if Marvel / Sony wanted them to meet MJ and Ned first in his house, why not showing the lost? In a world they don't know, they don't know anyone, show them trying to get answers. Looking for this earth's Peter but being persecuted but media and the police who thought they were the \"real\" Peter Parker. Why doing a Disney Channel worth comedy scene when bringing back two iconi Spider-Men after 15 to 20 years? It's such a waste, and the worst is that this scene is just after aunt May's death.The movie was at a point were everything was going bad for Peter, people he loved were dying, he was alone and lost like he never was, and Marvel thought it was good to crack jokes during what was the best Spider-Man moment in the MCU? Just WHYYYYYYYYYYY? Keep the jokes to the end of the movie, when they saved the world and everyone is happy. Do something better. And the jokes are so predictable. The thing is the jokes are more of meme related than movie related, what I mean by that is they kept referencing Spider-Man memes instead of doing their own original jokes, and that's a problem because it makes the movie a prisoner of its time instead of making the movie something that will transcend time. In 20 years when no day remembers the memes or people that don't know the memes will watch the movie, they won't get the jokes or won't think it's funny. And it's just sad.Another thing I don't get is Ned's magic ability? It comes from nowhere without a single explanation.The fact that they find ways to cure EVERY single one of them in a high school lab, like how? Andrew and Gwen had to go to Oscorp to do the antidote for Dr Connors and they just do everything in a high school? Nobody think it's weird? Also Tobey's Peter said he was thinking about and antidote for Norman for a long time, but really, why? Norman's been dead for 20 years why was he thinking about an antidote?There is just an enormous amount of plot holes like that that I don't understand.My final problem (for now) with the movie is the action sequences, more precisely the last one in the Statue of Liberty. Why they had to fight all at the same time in the same place? J. Jonah Jameson said that everywhere Spider-Man goes chaos and destruction follows, so why not doing the final scene in the city? Showing buildings being destroyed, and how it affects negatively the people of New York, show better the division between the ones that believe Peter and the ones that believe Mysterio? Since it was mentioned in the movie but never really showed.They could do the Spider-Men fight all over the city each with his own opponent, meeting with each other multiples time during the fight exchanging opponents or trying to help the others Spiders while dealing with their own villain. It could've been iconic. And show real destruction like J. J. Jameson was talking about. But they really just knock off the shield in the statue. It's really not a big deal.Plus the fact that it was night during the fight didn't help differentiate the Spideys at all.So yeah that's it for now.Don't get me wrong I don't hate the movie, on the contrary I love it. The thing is I don't love it for what it is, I love it for what it represents.3 different generations of Spider-Men, reuniting 3 fandoms that were always against each other. A first in the movie industry. It could have been so much more so much iconic and beautiful.Once the hype goes down people won't look at this the same way.Marvel and Sony had a great power, and the great responsibility to do us, Spidey fan and the amazing cast right. But they failed us. They sure gave us a Spider-Verse, but without the emotional weight it deserved, that WE deserved.I'm really looking forward to the future of Spider-Man in the MCU. No more Iron-Boy. The end was nearly perfect. And if I have to say something positive about this movie is that Tom Holland's Spider-Man finally has an origin story. This is the beginning of Spider-Man, Homecoming and Far From Home are prequels.", "Not a classic": "I was disappointed with the ending and felt like the writers had loads of ideas and they decided to do them all so everything was rushed. Best part was the end credit scene.", "One plot hole to rule them all": "I gave this a 7 as I love spider man. As a stand alone film. Maybe it's a 7. But really. It's probably a 5 at best.

This is very out of character. Wong warns him about the danger but leaves and ignores it.There was no explanation of how it opened rifts in time to pull characters from the past.Given that Peter didn't know that Ned would be able to open a portal, how was he expecting to return for Dr. Strange?The ending also makes no sense. Everyone forgets about Parker so that somehow closes the rifts.I did like the flying train, as an homage to Into The Multiverse.The cameo of Shang-Chi was lame.The MCU has investestes in developing three dimensional characters, so turning Dr. Strange into an irresponsible sidekick was insulting.", "Forgiveness v.s.corporal punishment?": "Sadly disappointed and not quite sure what movie critics saw outside of the action and CGI.From the opening minutes to the end, the lines felt forced... as if the words coming out of their mouths weren't connected to any real feelings the characters had. I never was made to feel there were actual repercussions for the outcomes of their situations. I found the situations, characters and lines overly contrived and so did my 15 year old son and 13 year old daughter who were both underwhelmed.Minus the dramatic action this would pass for a G rated movie.Nothing new here, lots of old with a poorly executed (no pun intended) excuse for why.", "It has no right to work, to not collapse under it's own weight.": "This movie is overlong, overblown, inconsistent, derivative, filled with pointless fan service, and at times painfully on the nose. All the same it is an absolute soaring triumph of a film. It moves quickly through the stuff that doesn't work and when the emotional peaks and valleys hit, they make all of those issues completely unimportant. I screamed out loud in the movie theater more than once. The entire theater did the same.

Stunning character development, solid plot, and great fun from start to finish. No character felt neglected, with each one getting a substantial amount of screen time and character development. I've never been so invested in a film before, but I honestly never felt bored or looked down at my phone to check the time. It really captures ur attention with great action scenes and fun surprises throughout! I don't think I've ever cried so many tears of joy in a film before!The only thing I can say about this film is that it is truly a perfect film in every way. Trust me when I say that marvel redeemed themselves with this movie!10/10 stars, and would watch this 1,000 times more! Highly recommend giving this a watch!

Remember we grown up watching spider man cartoons since we were kids.

Marvel should contribute some of the money earned for philanthropy for the child education and other things!", "Mid movie, overrated.": "Without the 2 Spider-Men returning, this movie was MID. The storyline could've been waayyy better. I also think that the music in the movie is disappointing, they could've used way better songs at some moments.Tobey gets stabbed without any consequences and all the villains return to their own universe and we don't know what happens with them?!This could've been sooooo much better with better writing, acting etc...\nOverall mid...", "The most comic-booky a live action film has ever been": "The sheer amount of stuff happening in every act, the quick introductions of beloved characters whenever the story wanted them to be there, the ridiculous over-the-top fan service.It was genuinely like reading a comic book, except in live action.If you love nonsensical superhero comic shenanigans, this movie delivers like no other before it.It does not get a perfect 10 from me because those are reserved for movies that I feel are unforgettable, that have moments I feel will stay with me forever. This movie doesn't seem to have any of those, but it is still just pure fun start-to-finish, and makes the future of the MCU (or is it MCM at this point?) look very bright and promising.", "Thanks for giving us this wonderfull gift": "This movie was indeed a love letter to all the fans.

It will bring back memories from years, and years ago. This brought me happiness, and sadness. This film made me feel like life was normal again. A theater pack of people who love Spider-Man as much as me. I sat beside the coolest guy, and we started talking about Marvel and our love for it. We both became really close friends. This movie is without a doubt the best Marvel film yet. Including Avengers Endgame! 100% go watch this movie - Spider-Man: No Way Home!", "They pulled it off. They healed the wound of the previous Spiderman franchises.": "I thought the new suicide squad movie had a difficult abstract story to sell, Spider-Man: No Way Home has it waaaaay worse.The multiverse is a concept that's hard to portray convincingly and it requires a LOT of suspension of disbelief from the audience. To make things worse they are being over ambitious bringing in the previous 2 Spiderman movie series from Sony, each of which had VERY different styles and protagonists (intentionally so). The 2nd series with Andrew Garfield also had very mixed reception to say the least.Yet somehow they pulled it off. It's a Christmas miracle. I went in with low expectations on how much they could use Dr. Oc and the other villains but not only does this movie use all those characters a lot but it does it well.I couldn't believe how well some of the fight scenes worked especially the ones with Dr. Oc and the one with the Green goblin. Of course there are twists and all the surprises are very well timed and executed.Another huge difficulty I had going in was wondering how they could convince us that Dr. Strange would really cast such a insane multiverse breaking spell in the first place, especially just to save face for Spiderman. Yet even that was handled well by the writers of this movie. The trailer was definitely misleading on this one.The visual effects match and surpass the Avengers series and while that's to be expected if they are going to sell the concept of the multiverse, it's still worth pointing out how well some of the scenes are composed. I especially loved the one fight scene near the end. Very picturesque and awe inspiring.The pacing changes from the start of the movie to the end where there's a strange quiet and the contrast with the rest of the fast paced movie really sinks in the idea and gravity of what just happened during the last scenes.All the actors for the spidermen were excellent, and so were actors for the villains. Some of them didn't get as much screen time or development as the others but this a 2.5 hour movie with an absolute truck load of info to dump on you and they have to do it in that time without you walking out of the theatre in frustration.Ultimately the story is worth the watch by itself but this movie doesn't lack is any of the other dimensions you might judge it in. Comedy, fun, sadness, love, forgiveness, relief, it has it all.This movie really feels like a long over due and very well deserved bow tie to provide closure for the 2 previous Spiderman series and this movie along with Spiderman: into the Spider-verse bring clarity and purpose for the entire Spiderman franchise moving forward.Overall money well spent, would watch it again. A very well deserved 10/10.", "Best Spider-Man film !": "This film is very fun and exciting! It is the best live action Spider-Man film yet. Loved all the nostalgic elements of the film! Highly recommend it!", "This is it. we can stop making movies": "Nothing will ever come close to this masterpiece. So no one needs to make anymore movies. Sure some might say it's what you expected but even if it was it brought so many parallels to one another that brought me to tears. Ive seen all of the Spider-Man movies and he has been my favorite superhero since I was a child. This was so special in so many ways and I am SO glad I have always been a Spider-Man Stan!! I have loved nothing more than this movie. The only thing I wish is that I could experience it for the first time again! Chefs kiss.", "The perfect Spiderman Movie": "Wow, wow, wow! What a perfect end to 2021 with this perfect film. There isn't one fault I have with it.Firstly, the villains were top-notch- with the Green Goblin really hurting Peter from the inside and really making him angry and showing a side of Peter Parker that we have never seen before. In the end, Peter was about to kill the Goblin before he got stopped by Tobey Maguire's Spiderman (which was another perfect thing about the film. As well as this, I loved Electros new suit and the more comic book accurate look about him. Doc Ock was great in this film as well, especially as he turned out good nad helped Peter in the end.The other spiderman actors reprising their role as spidey was brilliant and they caused a cheer from everyone in the cinema.This was a brilliant film and I am excited to see what they do next with the franchise!", "The most ambitious Marvel film since Endgame": "Oh boy. Spider-Man: No Way Home has finally hit theaters and man did I have a blast watching this movie. The premise is very simple - Peter's identity has been revealed and he asks for Dr. Strange's help to make everyone forget and in doing so, making a mess in the multiverse, bringing all of the previous villains from both the Maguire and Garfield era back.Now, it is no secret that this movie is jam-packed with Easter eggs and fan service, and the average, non-marvel-fanatic will have a tough time piecing everything together. However, for the big Marvel fanatics, this movie is going to be an amazing ride you never want to end. After the film I still feel as if I am on a sugar high, and not able to controle myself.I was afraid that in bringing all the previous villains back, some of them wouldn't be getting the best conclusion to their character arcs, like they got in their previous films - especially Doc Ock got a great conclusion for his character in Spider Man 2 - but the way they handled their characters in No Way Home was extremely brilliant.I am also glad that we got to see a lot more of some of the supporting cast. Both Zendaya and Jacob Batalon get some very good scenes, and their chemistry with each other and Tom Holland is better than ever. This movie contains their best acting performances which is mainly thanks to the amazing script.All in all this movie is phenomenal and it is a huge milestone for the MCU. I felt like the MCU was kinda losing it's grip as to what it wanted to do in the post Tony era, but now I am more confident in the MCU than I have ever been before!", "Time to fix your mistakes": "To be honest I wasn't expecting something BIG. Despite the spoilers that were hard to avoid, I was very surprised at some of the scenes. There were tears and many emotions. I love all mcu movies! Even though I'm not a spider man fan, I must admit that it was probably the best Marvel movie! I wholeheartedly recommend everyone to go to the CINEMA for this movie! There is no way that someone will not like it. Just remember about wipes, because they will definitely come in handy.", "YES YES AND YES": "Just perfect but some incoherent scenes, but just wow. The film turn around fan service of course but that's what we wanted ! The back of the three spider man in the same film , that's awesome ! Maybe the CGI is a bit weird sometimes but the show is steal the same.", "Still some minor bugs but overall AMAZING": "This movie is in my top three spider man movies of all time only after the original Sam Raimi film and\nSpider-Man 2, not counting animation or video games.The whole movie feels like a fresh breath from the MCU, keeping an innocent atmosphere but with a slight touch of suspense because we know that villains will appear at any minute. And when they do finally appear, they don't disappoint.The interpretation of Alfred Molina as the sinister Doc Ock is still amazing. Every line is delivered with coldness and cynicism.Jamie Fox is also a very welcome presence de in the movie. Although he constant banter and jokes take you out of the movie, just a bit, it is still very fun because of Jamie's charisma.Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifan also return as the classic villains Sandman and the Lizard, and while they don't stand out as much they definitely make the movie better.And Willem Dafoe, where to begin. This man was born to play the Green Goblin. The voice, the acting, the evil smiles and smirks, all of his interpretations both as Norman and the Goblin are amazing. I particularly love the scene where Peter feels the Goblin in the room.Spoilers:The scene on which the Goblin reveals himself and convinces the villains to go against Peter is just genuinely amazing. The hand to hand combat, the horror movie atmosphere and the interpretations are all amazing during this segment. And finally with May's death, and the phrase. It makes much more sense to transform May to \"Ben\" in this movie since while we do not deny Uncle Ben's existence, we needed to hear this phrase in the trilogy at least once.And now the elephant in the room: TOBEY MAGUIRE and ANDREW GARFIELD DO IN FACT APPEAR reprising their roles as the only one Spider-Man. Andrew is a bit of a clown in some moments but it is too epic that you don't mind and Tobey is just simply perfection. Remember that they are secondary characters. And I think their level of participation is just right although I would have liked to see a scene with only Tobey and Andrew.Peter trying to kill the Goblin goes within the line that this Peter is still young and vengative. Although he should not have tried to fight Tobey as this puts it a bit random why he doesn't just try to kill him again. Don't know.There are stilll some bugs during the first part of the movie where I think it goes by too fast and they forget they have an awesome set up besides the multiverse and it is that Peter's identity is out in the open. And they don't do as much with it.BTW, Matt's appearance played by Charlie Cox was more than welcome.Overall Spider-Man: No Way Home is one dark Spider-Man movie in which its returning characters make the movie fly above expectations, including JJJ. The characters of the ensemble in the past movies don't fall short and there is very little participation of Flash and Betty which is very nice. With some bugs along the way like Ned just randomly using magic, the movie has giant impact and will leave a smiling smile on your face. That doesn't make sense. Anyway:SPIDER-VERSE CONFIRMED!!!!!", "Mind blowing , Excellent , Outstanding.": "Outstanding and excellent movie in every ways perfect direction , action , storyline , acting . Definetly top notch movie. This movie for sure beat every record (10/10). A must watch for everyone.", "Spider-Man: Scripter Go Home": "I won't go too far here.There are so many great things in this movie, Andrew Garfield and Alfred. Molina in particular, the pictures, the humor and the exciting moments come with such epic idea for the Spider-Man sequence.There are some spoilers coming ahead.But writing. Why such preposterous concept? Since when the hero suppose to save the villain's life instead of defeat him? Why go politiclly correct? Why creating an histeric fullish reasoning for this whole movie? All the money spent on the movie but such a pure creativity in writing it? And could someone explain how Venom got there?The fight with the Goblin, having aunt May standing against the mighty Goblin is just pure stupidity, the whole scene after she gets hit is just boring and unreasonable, clean death could have been much more exciting and real, very bad timing for her weird meanningless last words speach.Feels like Peter Parker had no progress in this movie, he just continued sticking to foolish ways having everybody dangering their lives for him with no reason and solving the problems with few hours work in the lab like he hasn't finished highschool 2 minutes ago.Last thing - Ned opening portals. Seriously it took Doc. Stange ages to learn how to use that ring, suddenly Ned uses it in minutes? And of-course when he really needs to close the portal, nothing happens.Writing was way too lazy on this movie, huge dissapointment on this part. And yet, there's many other aspects that makes the movie great, so much appreciation to Marvel for taking a horrible script and making a top movie.", "Could have been solved with a phone call": "This movie created a problem and then solved it. If Tom had just called MIT and said, \"hey please reconsider me\" this movie wouldn't have happened just thought I should put that out there.", "spoiler Alert.Advise : Watch it at the earliest": "Watching all the three Spidermans in a single screen is a treat to one's eyes and specially seeing Tobey ... It's like going back to our childhood days.All the story is well drafted and you will never get bored throughout the movie.Advise:", "Sony & Marvel Studios listened to the fans. They listened hard": "It also sounds like spoilers to say no fan will be disappointed. Even the memes, they most definitely know that one beautiful meme. Also has a great amount ofr hilarious beats.", "A true masterpiece": "I went to see the movie last night, and I was truly blown away. Every little scene kept me at the edge of my seat, and I simply cannot recommend this movie enough. If you have enough money (and if they're even available), buy a ticket and go watch it.", "Epic Graphic": "It was good movie to see with family. And enjoyed me and my friends. The graphics Epic in this marvel movie.excellent movie to see with your friends and families.", "Literally the best movie I've ever seen in my life": "This is not only my favourite marvel movie - but my favourite movie ever. It exceeded my expectations (which were ridiculously high, so don't even ask how it did) and kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole duration.I grew up watching Tobey maguire and Andrew Garfield's spider man movies, so seeing the villains back again was a complete whirlwind of emotions. The nostalgia hit hard, seeing characters from my childhood being brought into the MCU made me incredibly happy. I don't even care how nerdy I sound writing this, it's literally one of the greatest experiences of my life.And that's the thing - it wasn't just a movie, it was a huge experience. I live in the UK, and here we don't clap/cheer/scream during or after movies. But we did in No Way Home. The audience laughing, cheering and whooping made everything better. Surrounded by marvel fans like yourself all together excited to see what happens, especially the cameos (even if half of them where leaked on bloody Twitter)It was just amazing. It had a perfect balance of humour, action, sadness and nostalgia. It was perfect. I've never said that about a movie before, but it was, perfect.If you're a fan of spider man, especially if you grew up watching the previous spider man films, you need to see this. I've watched it twice already (second time wasn't as good because there was a dead crowd \ud83d\ude44). You just need to see it, it's way bigger than avengers endgame in my opinion, and it opens up the door to so many more possibilities. The rest of the MCU movies and projects that come out from now on will be affected by the events of this movie - that's how impactful it is. Combine that with your childhood being brought back to life in front of your eyes and an amazing cast who clearly care so much about playing their role it's just overall incredible.I'm running out of words to describe Spider man no way home, but you get the idea. There will be some people that'll say there are some flaws, I.e. This character not being in it for long enough, this character not really needing to be there but I disagree. It was a complete perfect balance.Go watch it if you haven't already, and make sure to stay right until the end. Yes, I know how that sounds, you're probably thinking \"well yeah duh it's a marvel movie\" but you will not believe how many people left after watching the first after credits scene and didn't stay until the second. Don't be like them, be patient \ud83d\ude02", "Fun for Spidey Fans": "Decent movie, nothing too special, very good for fans of Spider-Man. Some characters serve very little purpose and the lead of the movie can feel very small sometimes. Does a good job of completing the arc of Spider-Man and introducing new villains. Willem DaFoe is especially great in this.", "I hope it's not the last one": "Best spiderman movie ever made and one of the top MCU movies. I really have nothing to add, marvel really out done itself this time.Just hoped that they would have played the spiderman classic theme song, it would have been great too.", "Amazing, spectacular and the Spidey we've been waiting for": "Despite the astounding amount of action, emotion and talent in this lovely movie- it was perfectly balanced.The acting was the best yet of any MCU movie in my opinion, I was completely invested throughout and loved the execution of the plot and thought every line and acting sequence was delivered perfectly.Wonderfully nostalgic, very well thought out and had the best/smoothest progression of any modern film I've seen in a long time!", "A fine marvel movie, between 7 and 7.5 i would give": "This review is just ment to say that this is a fine marvel movie but for some reason a crazy group, on the date of this review over 43%, gave a 10. That is insane and it is messing up the rating. I expect allot of (very) young people saw this movie and think a 10 is normal to give when you like a movie. Well a nice movie to whatch. Comes in this genre not even maybe close to the avenger movies endgame and infinity war. And current rating of 8.6 does make that suggestion.", "Character Development": "Wow...the spiderman character development is amazing... too much emotion in the movie and i love it...It really has the best story! L...This movie is really the perfect ending to a trilogy..i can't wait for Spider-man 4 and Tom Holland's Acting as Peter Parker.", "THIS!IS!CINEMA": "Anyone who thinks this film is \"another marvel movie\" or \"another superhero movie\" or \"just fan service\"\nIs PLAIN WRONG.This movie goes above and beyond with its ability to write a great and well crafted script.", "Best marvel film. Best spiderman film.": "Go watch Spiderman No Way Home NOW! If you haven't seen it yet what are you doing!? One of the best if not thE best superhero films ever made.Superb visuals, fight scenes, villains, action, surprises, you name it. This film delivers everything a Spiderman fan could want and delivers a phenomenal experience to anyone no matter what you like.Is it a perfect movie? No. But what this film has to offer is mind blowing. Seriously.. SERIOUSLY.. go see it. Anyone who isn't seeing it on the big screen is missing out big time. If you see this film at home or on a small screen you've robbed yourself of one of the best cinema experiences possible!!!Go. See. It.", "A beautiful trip down the memory lane": "Well unsurprisingly, Spider-Man: No Way Home is unarguably the best of the current trilogy. Probably even among the others. Marvel has had a rough 2021 but it's safe to say that this movie has saved it. From Start to finish, there are hardly any scenes where you'd feel burnt out or tired. Great job.", "Best Marvel movie since Infinity War": "Tom Holland killed this he was fantastic. A really well made movie that does service to Spider man fans. The acting, action, and the humor was great. Great to see Doc ock and Green goblin back and green goblin proves why he's one of the best comic book villains ever. Can't wait to see what happens next with Tom spider man.", "Epic, Splendid, Breathtaking": "How did the folks at Marvel and Columbia came with all these wonderful and surprising ideas?As I Marvel fan, I can say that it is the best movie based on Marvel comics ever made.", "Super movie": "One of best movie in the year and if you long time\nI am watching old spider man I like amazing spider man it's good feel and that movie no Nagitive points and more points that's movie is super movie.", "A little disappointed": "Not a bad but not as good as the reviews. Unfortunately the story was quite weak and the motives behind Spiderman\u00b4s actions just did not make any sense. I enjoy the witty jokes but it was a little too much. When there were some very beautiful moments they rushed it too hard by making funny jokes seconds later and the moment was gone. There was nothing wrong with the end but it left me very unsatisfied. Although, what saves this movie is all nostalgia and touching scenes.", "MEH": "To start of, the movie was very meh, i mean sure all the spiderman and villains are back from the 2001 to 2021 movies, but it wasn't that satisfying to me to other people, but it was funny, but thats all I can say, also it was kinda emotional by aunt may dying, but it was meh.", "A lot to love": "Yes, Tom gives his best performance yet as Spider-Man, and yes his on-screen chemistry with Zendaya is palpable because they're a couple IRL as well, and yes Spider-Man has, for the first time in this trilogy, real personal stakes on the line.But those are not why you should watch this movie. If you're a fan of Spider-Man, you should watch this movie because it will give you what you love, and a lot of it at that.Couldn't ask for a better holiday treat from a superhero movie.", "S P I D E R - M A N !!!!!!!!": "I was lucky enough to score an invite to the South Australian premiere of the film and to then see the midnight screening of the film upon its release.To me, this film is a perfect super-hero movie, but more so the perfect spider-man movie that pays tribute and is quite essentially an ode to all things that came before it.This is is most certainly Tom's best outing as Spidey. He experienced an abundance of emotions, all while learning how to control them and be the best version of himself that he can be, because you know, \"with great power comes great responsibility\".The ensemble cast work together like no other, the humour is beyond incredible and the visuals are absolutely stunning, backed up with an amazing score also.There's not much that can be said without spoiling the movie however, this movie is not one to be missed.An AMAZING conclusion to the homecoming trilogy. A must watch.", "Absolutely phenomenal": "This film is just phenomenal. Bringing the past god knows how many years together in one film. It was full of nostalgia, everyone played their characters amazingly. Slipped right back into character no problem. The chemistry between Tom, Andrew and Tobey was fantastic. The whole cinema applauded when Andrew and tobey showed their faces again. And for me personally after seeing the trailer where Tom clearly wasn't battling alone I thought Andrew and tobey wouldn't be in it all that long but they were in it for quite abit. I love how now spiderman has gone back to its proper roots. Just a broke Peter Parker, living in NYC no one knows his identity at all, no stark tech, new suit. So looking forward to future films and the next phase for marvel.Also 2 post credit scenes. Hinting that venom will come probably not Hardy but the symbiote goo left behind has so much potential!!! And the Dr strange 2 teaser trailer. Amazing. This film was so perfectly executed. 10000000/10.", "Easily The Best!": "I absolutely love how the previous villains from the other SpiderMan films are in the movie, and boy did they do everything right. The movie improved characters for the better, and overall this is a great film.", "Solid attempt...with hard flaws": "Great entertainment, very creative overall. But story beats interrupted by chit-chat moment is very confusing sometimes. The lay back bits are fun, but main narrative suffers so much that it frustrates me. I don't remember endgame being this chit chattery.Zendaya is cute, Cumberbatch is confusing but mostly believable. Tobey and Andrew fit quite well surprisingly.Major plot points are very forced. Holland's peters incentive is so weak. May's death is so cramped in it has so little room to breath it is literally next scene the sad music stops and MJ starts to crack jokes. I mean come on, this is the most emotional scene of the movie and it just ends LIKE THAT. I know it's boring but this just robs Holland's spidey so much story. It is absurd how thin Holland's story is. As I am writing this review I realized this film is intended to be like this; well I hated it about that. I hate flat stories.Well, worth two and half hours of my life.", "WHY DID AUNT MAY HAVE TO SAY THAT?": "I loved it, and I would say it really lives up to the hype, personally, I underestimated the abilities of Jon Watts and Marvel, so I was incredibly impressed when the film not only turned out good, but GREAT.There is one line, though, one line that genuinely ruined a portion of the movie and represented a wider problem of the film. Aunt May saying \"With great power comes great responsibility\" felt forced and was obvious fanfare. That line along with other silly references like it ruined Aunt May's death scene for me, in my opinion, it would have been better served by an instantaneous when getting hit by the glider and really lingering on Peter's reaction.The problem is that Spiderman had already made this statement, but put into different words in his first ever appearance - \"When you can do the things that I can, but you don't, and then the bad things happen, they happen because of you.\"Essentially the main point I take off of this film is the fanfare, some of it is ok, but most of it just ruins the scenes they're in.Watch the film, ignore the memes, and forget the existence of the lizard.", "A Dream Come True and More ...": "Tom Holland's 3rd solo outing as the titular web slinger is jam packed with action, heart felt moments and dare I say surprises. Its like once in a lifetime kind of movie, that does justice to almost all of its characters and in typical MCU fashion, tries to set up the next arc.By no means it is a perfect movie, and I can understand how hard it must have been for the director to juggle so much continuity and try to explain so much in a little over 2 hours. Still, Jon Watts manages to deliver us an amazing movie which looks and feels Marvel while still being firmly rooted in the Spiderman movie lore that came before it and for that, I would give the director and the writers a 10/10.I would also go as far as to say that there wasn't a single bad or for that matter average acting performance in the movie. Holland really kills it as the lead and has an incredible chemistry with Zendaya's MJ. Jacob Batalon is a treat to watch as Ned and Benedict Cumberbatch's commanding presence as Dr. Strange never ceases to amaze me.The villains also pull off great performances. The standout for me though was Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina and I hope to see them again if possible (Marvel please make it happen!).My problem with this is that it tries to set up a lot of stuff, coz of which, some moments didn't feel as impactful as they could have been (like that one cameo we all know :wink:). Other than that, its a perfect movie. Thanks Marvel and Sony, for making this happen.", "It was awful": "It was awful. The story was just for Kids. The writer didn't have any idea, the direction was awful. It just had some nostalgic parts. They destroyed popular character like dr. Streng. Please don't destroy popular characters, actors/actresses and directors when your story os weak. There was too many characters with a weak story. As vansh said What can i say man. After 2 bland Spider-Man movies they truly made up for that in NWH. What a way to bring about the characters that i grew up with from The Sam Raimi Spider-Man Trilogy to the Amazing Spider-Man movies from my teens. As a kid from the 90s this sure was a treat for us Millennials. We've been craving for something like this for ages.", "THE BEST SPIDERMAN MOVIE EVER": "I cant describe how good this movie is, the story, drama, comedy, acting, action and more all of it were perfect!!!!! Thank you sony & marvel for this incredible, masterpiece movie.WE LOVE YOU!", "Flawed plot but enjoyable": "This story is clearly made for fans and to earn money. I expected a deep story as like previous Marvel mega budget movies.As I seen tv show, loki's \"muli-verse\" seems logical but here it seems lighter and hollow in the plot.Overall, I enjoyed.Although, seeing Tobey and tom give me chills.", "Best \"Solo\" MCU Spider-Man entry.": "Wow. 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' was truly impressive.Following Mysterio's reveal of his identity as 'Spider-Man', Peter Parker enlists the aid of Doctor Strange to cast a spell that will cause the world to forget his identity, but the spell goes sideways and causes villains from alternate universes, who also know Spider-Man's identity, to begin merging with this MCU Spider-Man universe. Knowing that they face imminent death when they're returned to their original universes, Spider-Man thwarts Doctor Strange from returning them, and instead attempts to help them and alter their fates.What I imagine as being backroom wrangling between two gigantic film companies over the 'Spider-Man' character and his precarious presence within the MCU, actually winds up resulting in the best of the MCU 'Spider-Man' films, with a truly fun, interesting and inventive story.Stressing that this is a SPOILER review; in addition to bringing back the villains from the other two Sony iterations, I thought it was SO cool that they were actually able to get both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield to reprise their roles as the Spider-Man of each of their respective, alternate universes, and they both kill it in this movie. I had heard the rumors about both returning, but Andrew Garfield vehemently denied involvement, making it that much cooler when he actually showed up. Also, story threads from both versions of the character are touched on, not simply as references (though there are lots of those), but as actual character arcs that have been carried over from the other two film series, making this movie a truly unique experience.All of the returning villains also do a great job, but Willem DaFoe's portrayal of the psychotic 'Norman Osbourn/Green Goblin' is just as creepy and mesmerizing as it was twenty years ago.I'm not the biggest fan of Tom Holland's version of the Spider-Man character, whose portrayal of Peter Parker is often suggestive more of an excited five year-old on a sugar high than a fifteen year-old, who always seems like he's on the verge of asking some older person \"Daddy, why is the sky blue?\" or \"Are we there yet?\", but his portrayal here seems to be slightly more complex than his previous outings. He not only experiences a tragic loss, but the moral dilemma of what to do with the \"Sinister Five\" (they were ALMOST there), who are completely at his mercy (at least initially), presents an interesting question, and the choice he makes has dire consequences for him, and apparently the broader MCU as well.The ending, though satisfying, also raises a lot of questions.This is everything (and more) that I was hoping this movie would be when rumors of the story and cast first began popping up, and this is easily the best of Spider-Man's \"solo\" runs in the MCU.", "Good, Fanboys are pumping the score": "Its a solid movie, but other than it being spiderman, how is this better than mission impossible Fallout? Don't get me wrong... its good, but more of a 7 than a 9.", "Very poor scenario, terrible acting": "After so many movies in the Spider-Man franchise, writers clearly running out of ideas decided to mix baddies and Spidermen from previous movies, because... \"multiverse\". It is easy to imagine the short brainstorming that led to the idea of this movie. \"We don't know what to do with Spider-Man, let's bring old Spidermen fight old baddies\".The effort to write a credible storyline is minimal, the interactions between actors are lame. It is overall a terrible movie that looks like so many sequels just banking on recycling past fame. Lots of CGI action does not compensate for these fatal flaws.Save your time and money.", "Left me Feeling Nostalgic": "I am not the biggest fan of the multiverse, but this left me feeling nostalgic. Spiderman is always fun to watch. I have loved each and every Spiderman. My oldest son to my youngest so have been Spiderman fans and this brought memories of each movie that I watched with them. I was not as crazy about this Lizard. It did not fit as well. I like how they tied everything together and the aspect of seeing what changed in the bad guys in time. I like the teamwork aspect as well. If you love Spiderman and have enjoyed all of them you will likely appreciate all of them being tied together.", "Simply Beautiful!": "This is Oscar worthy if not Oscar worthy performances! Willem Defoe killed his performance and Tom Holland deserves an Oscar! This beautiful movie brought all generations of Spider Man fans together whether it was \"Spider-Man\", \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" or the comics. This brought closure to 2 franchises that didn't get their proper ending. I absolutely loved the interaction between the three Peter's, comical yet amazing! The fans asked and received! Thank you Jon Watts, his crew and all the amazing actors/actresses that made this rollercoaster (of emotions) of a movie!", "I HAVENT SEEN A MOVIE AS GOOD AS THIS IN SUCH A LOOOOOONG TIME!!": "I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT TO SAY!??? IF U HAVENT WATCHED IT U HAVE TO LJKE RN. EVERYTHING WAS JUST SO GOOD AND I RARELY EVER SAY THIS IVE NEVER REALLY GIVEN A MOVIE A 10/10 OR ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER BUT THIS DESERVED AF!! EVERYONES ACTING WAS LITERALLY PERFECT.", "Webslinger Perfection": "So I've finally watched this and there will be NO SPOILERS. As a teenager I was a Big Marvel fan, reading all the comics long before the MCU was born. My 2 favourite superheroes were Spiderman and Doctor Strange. Spidey because he was a teenager and I could relate to a lot of his teenage angst. Doctor Strange for the surreal and amazing imagination and artwork. So this movie was like heaven to me! Tom Holland surely cements himself as the best Spiderman/Peter Parker of all time in this. He is simply sensational and demonstrates every emotion going with total conviction. Benedict Cumberbatch is also perfect as Doctor Strange and we get to see just how powerful he really is. But for me it's Parker's friends and love interest played respectively by Jacob Batalon and Zendaya who are the beating heart of this movie. There is the return of some iconic villains which is brilliantly realised. Marvel are the Gold standard of moviemaking. They excel in every department from script to cast to effects and Direction. This is up there with the greatest superhero movies of all time and certainly the best Spiderman film. Absolutely fantastic from start to finish. It doesn't miss a beat!", "Time for a Spidey Break": "With this latest entry from the MCU Spider-Man, it is more of what you would expect.Let's get the good out of the way. Seeing Tobey and Andrew stepping back into the Spider-Man costume is a delight for fans of the old movies as well as seeing some of the classic villain's from said movies as well. The action scenes are good and are what you would expect from a Marvel film.However, having the nostalgia of seeing past Spider-Man and villian's in this movie is what in the end hurts this movie the most. Why? Because once again, they have written Tom Holland's version of Spider-Man to not be able to support a movie on his own. \"Homecoming\" relied on Tony Stark and \"Far From Home\" relied on Tony's death as well as Nick Fury. Tom's Spider-Man should have had his own independent movie like the Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor to set up his character and show he is a major player.And it is sad to say that they did a poor job establishing Spider-Man's world within the MCU that they had to go back just to take the work done in previous movies to create the classic villain's from Spider-Man. Norman Oswald does not exist in the MCU? His company OsCorp should have been the company that becomes the big power house once Stark died.And there are many instances where the dialog will have your eyes rolling. Peter and MJ in this movie just do not have the chemistry to make their relationship believable. And certain scenes open up new plot holes and will make you ask \" Wait a minute\" as to why some of these spells and magics were not used in more desperate times other than Peter's identity being revealed.I believe it is time for Spider-Man to take a break for a few years and come back swinging on his own independent adventure.", "Filled with fan service but good fan service": "This movie was filled with fan service but they didn't just have the fan service for the sake of fan service and actually incorporated the fan service into the plot.When it comes to other stuff; the directing was good as always, the acting was good as always, and the acting from Willem Dafoe was great. My problems lies in the writing of some of the characters; Doc Ock was a bit too comedic(I know it's the MCU but still) and sandman's writing was werid, at first he helped Peter fight electro but then he suddenly started acting him and being a villain even though at first this seemed like it was happening after his redemption (since he helped him in the beginning). I'm surprised more people aren't mentioning this.", "It's the best spiderman movie ever made": "Marvel's comic universe has been releasing a pack of movies/series over the last several years back to back, cramming every available platform to keep all kinds of audiences thoroughly engaged with its emphatic content. There is no time to rest if you are an ardent follower. One must learn to adapt to embrace caprice in the content and the characters playing them.While the past ten years have given us a glimpse into a flurry of new characters in the Marvels space, some of the existing ones have traversed through multi-verse packing alarming delirium.For instance, spiderman and I believe all of you would agree with me when I say that this is the only character from the comic world that has been deputed to hold its identity through several avatars in the space of two decades. We had a lot of actors playing spiderman before that too, but we will keep it specific to the modern-day rendering of the wall-crawler or famously known as web-slinger. And somewhere during this entire period, I thought marvel had played amiss with the idea of spiderman hopping without putting a viable end to the story of the actors playing it in different times. I mean, Why was Tobey's spiderman had to relinquish the summoned advantage in favor of gliding his storyline into obscurity? Or why was Andrew Garfield introduced and suddenly taken away until Tom Holland lobbed it out of the park with his rendition? Of course, age is a visible factor that cannot be ignored because every grain of spiderman's character bears a constitution of a teenager, and any actor that couldn't fulfill physically must bow out at the right time.I was moved by this gigantic error of casting and recasting lacking suitable or functional disposition tending to a vast amount of vacuum without proper explanation. Rebooting always comes with emotional baggage for me as an audience. The performance of yesteryear always influences my experience watching spiderman jump from building to building. The bigger question was, would we ever have a chance to go back and watch Tobey and Andrew play our favorite comic character.Until, of course, spiderman no way home happened. The movie opens up with Peter visibly shaken by the unprecedented attention from the earthlings after his real identity is exposed by Rey Mysterio in the aftermath of the last installment. A compelling question that slinks back on his mind is to somehow watch the world forget about him. He seeks Doctor strange's help to cast a spell that will rewrite his identity, which roundly opens the path to parallel universes, aka multi-verse, after the magic goes horribly wrong. Mighty villains from previous franchises find their way back to exact revenge on their Peter Parker responsible for inflicting an excruciating hurt during their heydays. When the truth about their death dawns on the gang, fog surrounding the multi-verse concept further deepens. The screenplay tactfully handles and articulates the key components that any further pondering of the subject doesn't project it far-fetched from reality. Well, in the manner of speaking.Unlike the previous 2 installments, the movie conveniently parks itself in a parking lot that faces dense mist of dark overtones vis-a-vis the lighter theme of the last two. Tom Holland leads the overbearing emotional trip that oscillates between reels of notable witty dialogues and despair of unprecedented loss that ably relies on the support from other cast members. Except for Doctor Strange, whose depiction of a character that remains unfazed by the goings-on in the most recent universe lends a balance to emotional symmetry.Every time the plot introduced the famous villains from the past universes, a shockingly quiet crowd in the movie hall blared up the gloomy walls of the theatre with uncomprehending strain on their lungs. It was a fitting reminder that history does repeat itself, and it comes with a cry of its own. In their typical erstwhile rendering, where they caused mayhem and chaos obliterating anything and everything in their path, the movie does a brilliant job in assembling their destructive escapades. Of course, this was nothing compared to when the spidermen from the last two universes are sucked into the middle of unrelenting disarray by a spell gone wrong once again. I sense a pattern here. Anyway, when Tobey casually walks through the portal from another world dressed as a commoner, the unbridled yelling nearly drowned out the accompanying dialogue exchange. At which point, I sorely wept at the hair loss inside my eardrum. Here is a bristle that would never grow back.Watching the three spidermen stand next to each other, here is a sentence I never thought I would ever use in my lifetime. But it does make me sound oafish for attempting to paint a decent picture that no impeccable brush strokes would be able to conceive if not for observing the trio on the big screen. It was like a dying wish fulfilled for watching Tobey come back from the throes of anonymity dressed as a spiderman even as a decade and a half have flown by. One would say my review is particularly conspicuous with the absence of any remarks on Andrew, but, the truth be told, his rendering is impressive but not at par with what Tobey did years ago. He holds a special place in our hearts, and no amount of Andrew or Tom's version would spawn an Alzheimer's. I think I got emotional there. In the spirit of the sanctified turf of a wall-crawler, let me bury my petty bias well under my chair and rise above the inconsequential debate. Maybe, that's too political.Anyway, I am not trying to review the movie by peeling it down piece by piece all the way to the core to single out the imperfections or celebrate the perfections. I am only attempting to relive the experience of watching it on the big screen, just like every other fanboy who follows the Marvels' world like a mad sociopath. In my honest opinion putting aside my fierce loyalty for the franchise, the movie is a treat for the eyes as an independent unit. Compared to the last two, it stands for itself and definitely stands atop the list. Watch it for the performances, a stunning and a quick skim through the characters of parallel universes, and of course, a token gesture of watching the two favorite spidermen from the previous franchise. If you must look beneath the notion of multi-verse, you will actually notice the distinction created by multiple directors working on making their version of spiderman. But the MCU version lets us take a comforting refuge in the knowledge that multi universes do exist, and it takes more than 1 spiderman to come back and remind us of it.", "Spider-Man home run!": "The best Spiderman movie I've ever seen. I don't know if it's because it's every Spiderman movie in one but that aspect of it blew my Mind! I wasn't aware of the story plot or characters in this latest movie and was pleasantly surprised. I saw this at the imax theater in Ft. Lauderdale and I'm glad I did. The interaction with the crowd laughing, clapping, cheering and gasping led to the whole experience. For sure want to see this again!", "What happened to Spiderman?": "I took my kid to watch this videogamesque movie and he definitely enjoyed it. But what happened to the Spiderman Stan Lee created? The Spiderman that made his own suit, was just a kid that was struggling with his job and boss, had to fight those weird villains in the city and didn't have anything to do with being involved with time travel, magic, different universes. In the animated version worked perfectly and that's where it should stay. The only thing my kid probably was expecting and never came out were clowns in a circus.The 6 I rated was for the technical merit. Marvel finally made a movie that the CGI almost didn't look like a videogame. Almost.", "That perfect Spiderman movie": "To be honest I never liked Tom Holland's incarnation as Spiderman. Its like he got things on a silver platter or something. Stark as a mentor, Avengers team up, nanotech suit! No emotional baggage of Uncle Ben or MJ. But now it seems its justified because he is destined for even more catastrophic threats. The world is literally ending around him these days. But what was great about him was he proved that the real superpower is showing kindness! He had the courage to help is enemies avoid certain death even when they were trying to kill him. And when we ask for fan service, what a service it was! I wish to keep this spoiler free so really cant say much about the plot. But the friendly neighbourhood Spiderman gets the help that he deserves!", "That kind that make you smile!": "Very enjoyable movie. Fun, fast paced, interesting, dramatic and full of action sequences. I like the plot and characters give a good dosis of scenic passion, specially Tom Holland. Good movie to enjoy in theaters as is packed of nice sound and effects and totally worth the ticket. For sure sequels are well deserved and hopefully all the possibilities of alternative universes will gives vastly interesting plots.", "Best Marvel/Spider-Man Movie Ever!": "This movie is the best Spider-Man movie ever, of course in my opinion. I've watched this movie 4 times already and although the first time was the best, it's still good every time. There's just so much to say about this movie. It's definitely worth watching for 2 and a half hours. I feel like it should've been at least 3 hours but it's fine. I personally love Spider-Man and he's my favorite superhero. Homecoming and Far From Home were both \"okay\" movies to me, but I just never liked Tom Holland playing Spider-Man. But after watching No Way Home, my opinion has changed on Tom's Spider-Man a LOT.There's so many things to talk about. This movie is unreal. It's a dream come true. Personally, not the biggest fan of the Daredevil Netflix show, but I do like the 2003 movie with Ben Affleck, but seeing Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock still got me excited the first time. He plays a small role and be only had about 2 minutes of screen time but it was still great! Seeing Doc Ock show up for the first time was absolutely amazing and gave me chills. I love the bridge fight scene. When Electro showed up it was AMAZING. Although it was a quick fight scene I really enjoyed it and I also enjoyed Electros theme playing, even though it was only for 2 seconds. Sandman and the Lizard were the worst villains in this movie. I like Sandman's part in Spider-Man 3 and the Lizard's part in TASM 1, but I hate that sandman was just a CGI, literal, sand-man and I hate that the lizard stayed in the Lizard form all movie and that he sounded normal. Doc Ock was good the whole movie but I don't really like that he helped Spider-Man. The Green Goblin was a MENACE the whole movie and I LOVED it! In the condo fight scene, Peter was on on top of him, punching his face, and elbowing his face and he just laughed and it sounded so evil, it was GREAT! It really shows how powerful the Green Goblin is. I really like how Aunt May was Tom's version of Uncle Ben. The \"with great power, must also come great responsibility\" line was amazing. It was so sad when Aunt May died. And of course, Tobey and Andrew! When they came in I wanted to cry! I grew up watching Tobey's movies and I love all 3 of them. I like Andrew's Spider-Man but his Peter just sounds so awkward when he talks. I still love TASM movies. Tobey definitely deserves Spider-Man 4 and Andrew definitely deserves TASM 3.", "Great!!!": "One of the greatest Movie ever. It's best feeling to see those kind of movies in Cinemas. So yeah not gonna talk about the whole story with venom and spidy. Looking forward to new films and continuation of whole Saga.10/10 from me.I wish stan could see and experience all the emotions we do...R. I. P.", "The best Spider-Man film ever!": "This movie is easily the best MCU film, the best Spider-Man film, and the best superhero film to ever exist, and I don't feel that I should explain why.The fact that the original actors all returned to reprise their roles and portrayed them as perfectly now as they did then is just icing on the delicious and enormous chocolate cake of this four course meal of a film (honestly, this is the best way I can accurately describe this cinematic masterpiece). I also really loved the fact that the villains interacted with each other in this film.While I do have some nitpicks, these are minor and pale in comparison to the brilliance of this film.This movie is the perfect movie, and if you don't like it, then that's your opinion, but I can't even fathom why you'd feel this way towards this cinematic masterpiece.", "For those who agree with me.": "Use my post to express your thoughts.1. Filmmaking perfection. The pacing of the movie is incredibly tight and top notch. A roller coster from the very start to finish. Immersive directing choices like the perspective of MJ as spiderman is swinging with her and how scary it feels. Things like making green goblin very scary. I didn't expect that. I was more tense than I was during winter soldier.2. Tom Holland is the best spiderman. Yup, a crazy take. I was a die hard Tobey fan, I laughed at people who didn't think he was the best spiderman. That would've been true before this movie. After watching this, I have been converted. The last two films failed to showcase Tom's skills in being Peter Parker. I got those Civil War hype vibes from this no way home Peter Parker. You guys remember? Remember how everyone was blown away by how good Tom Holland was? Well here, you can see it. Tobey doesn't have the humor. The kid like nature. He seems so adult. Andrew is too much like a kid, too teenagey and broody, not heroic and 'friendly neighborhood' enough. Tom Holland is like a nice mix of the two. I was confused after walking out of the cinema. Was Tom Holland just as good as Tobey? By the time I got home I realized the undeniable truth. No, Tom Holland is the best.3. Good use of fan service. This movie is still a 9/10 even without the use of fan service. SO THAT SAYS A LOT. Very good film on its own. With the fan service, it elevates this movie to be the best Marvel movie ever. The extra characters are used for the story, they're not just there to be cool and gather applause.4. This movie is story driven not action driven. A first for marvel.5. Hilarious. The comedic moments are extremely funny. The trailers tricked me into thinking it was going to be awkward humor. I remember laughing out loud audibly. I have never done that in a cinema. I mean, I laugh, but I hold it in usually. But this time, I couldn't.6. Action scenes are so so good. It was Infinity war level good. The trailers tricked me again. I thought the action was going to be mediocre just like in Far From Home. Nope.7. Zendaya and Ned are finally good characters. From the first two movies, they've been pretty much DLC NPC characters that I never really cared about. Now I see that without them, Peter Parker is nothing. I mean I knew that, I'm just saying this time I FELT that.That's all I can say without spoiling anything. I love this movie so much. It is so unexpected. I never give 10/10 to movies. Not even Interstellar. It's hard for me to express what I feel without writing an essay. I'll say this, I'm going to extremely upset if the final IMDB rating for this movie is less than 8.6. I don't think it deserves any less than that. Please please let it at least be higher than Endgame.", "If you haven't watched it, what are you doing": "This movie is out of this world, when I watched avengers endgame the theatre was silent but when I watched this one there was screaming and shouting and even tho I'm a quiet person this movie had me full of joy and I was screaming out of existence. This movie is just perfect and the endings had to be the best ending I've ever seen.", "One of the best movies of all time.": "This movie managed to satisfy me. Although the fact that there were many villians was not needed in this movie. So basically, the whole movie was based on Peter trying to give the villians a second chance. I don't think it was worth it though. If Peter listened to Doctor Strange in the beginning then none of this would have happened. And I think this movie could have had a better story.", "\"The Greatest (Live Action) Spider-Man Movie Thus Far!!!\"": "This is without a doubt one of Marvel's best live action movies, if not the best movie they've made! The acting, the directing, the music, the humor, the suspense, the characters - they were all done just about right! And I'm so glad that they brought back Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock, though I truly wish he had a slightly larger role (and I'm still incredibly pissed \"Daredevil\" wasn't given a proper ending...along with \"The Punisher\"). And although I thought that whole \"Hobgoblin\" look was interesting, I really wish Norman would have kept the goblin helmet.I am just so glad that the people who worked on this movie put much more focus on the story and characters than the humor, like other Marvel projects tend to do. I was happy to see other villains of Spider-Man appear in the movie and portrayed by the same actors from the previous movies. However, it gave me the impression that the \"Sinister Six\" might happen, which didn't because there were only five of Spider-Man's villains - which I have to admit, was kind of a bummer.What was the best part, of course, was seeing Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield reprise their roles as their respective versions of Spider-Man. When you see them interact with each other, you really do see the way they would interact with each other. All three Peter Parkers had great chemistry together, despite only working together for a short amount of time. And I could see that the creators wanted to give each Peter Parker a right amount of time whenever they were on screen together. One of my favorite parts was how Andre and Tom's Pater were like envious of how Tobey's Peter could shoot organic webbing. Though I did think that the farewell between the three Peters could have been just a little more heartfelt. And I seriously hope that they meet one another again.", "Next movie": "There was a Spiderman Homecoming\nSpiderman Far From Home\nSpiderman No Way HomeNext one will be Spiderman Where's My Home.It was a great movie\nNo spoilers\nBut great movie.", "Love it! - Here are some weak spots:": "I almost didn't want to review this movie because its so talked about, and I really didn't know if I have a lot to say.This movie is so freaking fun. It is everything everyone asked for.I can't express the excitement I felt when Tobey and Andrew show up. I remember going to see Spiderman 1 & 2 in the theater with my brother so it def struck an emotional chord.Since there is so much great conversation around this movie..I actually want to talk about the beats that felt weird.1. The conversations between the villians felt a little awkward from time to time. Especially compared to the chemistry that is demonstrated between the Heros at the end of the movie.2. This movie revolves around a plot designed to give us some fan service. You may love that! But it is true all the same.3. Portals are becoming a writers excuse in marvel movies. AND if Ned can figure out how to open portals in 30 seconds, he should be able to become the sorcerer supreme by the end of the movie!Remember I love this movie so much! I just had some specific thoughts that a lot of people don't talk about.", "I don't get the hype...": "It was a good movie but 8.9?! Heck no. I actually liked the other ones better. It was a cool concept but I actually found it a little slow. I wonder if this was the product of the lawsuit with Spider-Man and the stipulation.", "Best comic book movie ever": "The movie is just so amazing, beautiful, emotional, and perfect. Couldn't ask for a better movie. Loved every second of the film. They did everything so well and the development of character is so beautiful and well done. I can't believe how they pulled this off but they did.", "Not the best movie but some amazing moments": "If you love Spider-Man this is a must see movie. The beginning isn't great. The plan Peter and Aunt May come up with is laughable at best, Doctor Strange is a little to silly IMO and while it's great to see all the old villains again there were too many of them to really have a great standout villain. It all becomes worth it when the other Spider-Men make their appearance. I'm a sucker for nostalgia and this definitely hit me right in the feels. Call backs from previous movies are plentiful but never get old. It's a real treat to see the 3 Spideys interact and fight together and I don't think anyone can be disappointed with those scenes . As a whole it's not the best Spider-Man movie but it definitely has some of the best Spider-Man movie moments.", "Does what a spider can": "Believe the hype!!!! It's is everything a real marvel fan could want and more. This film was perfect from start to finish, an instant classic and will smash records.", "Three is better than one": "The first part of the film wasn't so thrilling for me. I was accustomed to see a Spider-MAN not a Spider-Boy because I think that a superhero is a man or a woman, not a boy that makes mistakes for his young age. The second part of the film (when happened the meeting...) instead, was very funny and nice to see.I never saw the other two films but I want to do it!", "Yeah this what I expected": "Bad cinematography\nBad action/choreography.Lack of characters depth\n-\nBut yeah jon watts really has a genius idea to rebooting this spiderman again to make how spiderman really spiderman, cant wait to see spiderman 4 which i can see Peter Parker whos really lonely, struggling with his financial problem, trying to live as an ordinary person and a superhero, in love with someone, and friends and many more abt his personalities.", "This Is Called A spider man Movie": "U will get what u need ..this is the best spiderman movie till date... clean your throat n go to teaters and carry a strepcells...nothing more to say.", "This is the first movie i watched in theaters during the pandamic": "The Movie is awesome the theatre experience is also very good. The story line of the movie is brilliantly connected to the other marvel movies.I didnt expect the other two spidermen to appear in this movie. I thought those were just people assuming that \"in case they come\".", "Pretty mediocre": "I've managed to watch this film 4 times now. The first viewing was amazing and left me feeling quite satisfied overall with the movie. However, with each subsequent rewatch I started to notice cracks within the movies plot. Once you strip away all of the nostalgia for the older movies and actors, you're left with your standard MCU popcorn flick that relies way too much on jokes. I read other reviews raving about how sad the movie is and how great the plot was, but every scene felt as if it was forcing me to feel a certain emotion. Granted this isn't necessarily a bad thing, however, when a movie forced you to feel emotions it takes away the audiences freedom to feel/figure out the emotions yourself.Not to say that I hated this movie. I thought that every actor gave an outstanding performance (minus Marisa Tomei) and while the action scenes were fun to watch, they had pretty horrible visuals and sometimes was quite ugly to look at.Overall, I'd say that the movie was just a slightly above average popcorn movie. Nothing more and nothing less.", "Behind the blow, it feels that marvel studios and Sony are still at odds": "The film contains fans service aplenty, however I believe this was used to cover up the waning relationship between two major companies and the inner battle for ownership over arguably the most valuable and popular superhero in a franchise's arsenal.Major plot decisions made no sense when there where more multiple and easier options for the character, and the ending literally felt like they were writing him out of any further/future projects that he may be able to appear in. I hope that I am wrong, but this really did feel like a forced swan song.", "Storyline": "Actually I'm not interested with this storyline of this film. Looks like boring.Should have a little bit of reality in the storyline to feel it like can be happened.", "Solid but a little overrated": "It was a good movie but I wouldn't say its should have a better rating than endgame or infinity war. Still a very good movie the acting by Tom was amazing, but Andrew kinda stole the show.", "They ruined the spiderman franchise. Story can't be more lame.": "I can list a dozen things wrong with this movie but there are only very few good things. The story is plain stupid. Doctor strange, he got all these mad powers, but in this movie he was kinda like a dummy. Fight scenes were very few. It's just one fight at the end, that was too dark and lame. They got all these legendary characters into one single movie but it was a waste. The movie streches with no story, humour or action.I've been a huge Spiderman fan since I was a kid, I don't like what Marvel is doing with the new Spiderman. There's no sense of responsibility, he always needs a babysitter like Ironman or Doctor Strange. Remember the good old days when spiderman used to fight his own battles, gets beaten up, those epic background scores that pumps your heartbeat, villians that made sense? Now it's all too techie, he is fully equipped with Ironman grade tech to the level he is not a spiderman anymore. I'm sure that there are some true fans out there who feel the same way and thinks The Amazing Spiderman was the best franchise made till date, or atleast the Original Spiderman was.", "One of the best Marvel's films ever": "I was really waiting for this film since it's announcement. Spider-man is one of my favourite superheroes, actually, so I'm glad this film really came out. About five years ago no one could imagine that ALL of the Spider-man versions would ever be in one film at the same time.Yeah, from my point of view fan service is one of the best sights of this film. Despite that, the plot is also good. Characters have their own characters, they are not just bad guys or good guys. The chemistry beetween Peter's friends and beetween villains is very great. Actually, the film has some inconsistencies in it's scenary, but it is still great.In conclusion, I can say that for me \"Infinity war\" for example is a better title, but \"Spider-man: No way home\" is one of the best Marvel's films ever.", "My review of No Way Home": "Spider man No Way Home \ud83d\ude2d it's not a movie it's an experience once in my lifetime.

While I enjoyed Homecoming a lot, Far From Home seemed essentially like a retread with a lot of the same things going on in it as with several of its predecessors. As a result, it suffered. As for No Way Home, wow. Just wow. This is very likely the definitive Spider-Man entry across all franchises. The movie is extremely emotional which is a great change of pace from MCU movies in general as well as on par with the better Spider-Man movies. Not too mention it has a fantastic way of giving us closure for each of our leads despite leaving the future wide open. Paced brilliantly as well, you genuinely feel the tension rise, and fall as the movie goes on. We need more Spider-Man movies like this: supremely emotional with exceptional payoff. In Feige we trust.", "best spider-man movie": "This is one of my favorite movies of all time i defiantly recommend watching it. My family really love this movie and i can watch it all day. Everyday.

Great action and effects, not so great of a storyline.

And like I said this is only my opinion, some may believe it is the greatest marvel movie ever I just don't believe it is.", "Only for theatres.": "The movie is made exclusively for theatres. It is an amazing and not miss experience, with the atmosphere crackling when old familiar faces appear.One of the best MCU movies and the best spider-man movie.", "The best Spider-Man film to date": "Marvel did it again.

They could've done a lot more with him for the last battle scene (at least they gave him a better haircut). Sandman was kinda boring and didn't do much either. Really the only person that had a good battle scene between Tom Holland was Green Goblin. Other than that the fight scenes were pretty underwhelming to say the least. At least they had Andrew and Tobey in the movie though so that kinda made up for it. I nearly cried when Aunt May died. You could really feel Tom's emotions. After she died, you could tell he wanted to give up and didn't want to try anymore. Pretty good movie other than the fight scenes.

Endgame is way better.", "Spidey does it again!": "This movie was more than a movie.. it was a walk down memory lane, one that was filled with all kind of emotions.

Picking up right where FFH left off, Peter's struggle to live his double life is coming undone and he seeks help from Dr Strange to undo some damage. What could possibly go wrong?What I loved about this movie as a life long Spidey fan is how it really deals with the cost to Peter for being Spider-Man better than any of the other movies have. It manages this while balancing the drama, the action and the trademark Spider-Man comedy perfectly.You could argue that this is the most serious of the 8 Spider-Man movies with plenty of moments to pull on your heart strings. There are also crowd pleasing moments galore. No spoilers, but there are some awesome surprises thrown in.It was never going to reach the heights of Infinity War or Endgame, but it could well be the best Spidey movie ever!

The second, alright, the third, awful. It felt like a movie written by someone at secondary school.The whole plot, was a waste of time. Spider-Man goes to ask for help about college applications, something that would have been reassessed anyway had he maybe spoken to admissions and his constant interruptions causes the spell to go wrong, this is a college age boy now, not a teenage kid, the timeline is aging Tom Holland but the script is keeping him a child, it doesn't match up. He should be maturing and aging with each movie, the perfect example of this is the Harry Potter movies. This is immature writing from Chris and his team.Then the whole premise is that they need to be solved, but ultimately they get sent home. They arrive in this universe seconds from death, when returned to their universe, that won't change and as such, will still die and ultimately, be a whole waste of time.Then everyone forgetting who Spider-Man is, is basically just carrying over/copying themes from the more successful Marvel movies.So much of this movie felt like fluff and Un-needed and everyone in the theatre spent so long waiting for something to happen and then when there was action it was over as quickly as it started.This movie ultimately was dialog heavy, all over the place, lacked timeline growth and was just a farce. I rated this movie a 6 as the cast Zendaya, Tom etc are fantastic, they deserve better than this writing.", "Already waiting for the next movie": "This is on my option the best bst spiderman movie. It contains many nostalgic characters from the past ;) and has a good plot that makes sense. The movie is fun and also has many emotional moments. The end of the movie is a bit frustrating, but also makes me impatient for the next movie.", "Good always wins, but...": "The beginning is a standard Marvel comedy, but then the film smoothly transitions into drama, which, although mixed with jokes (12+ movie after all), but they only dilute the dramatic tone of the film. There were no surprises. The villains rejoice.Pleased with the villains of the film - they do not seek revenge on Tony Stark, like the Vulture or Mysterio. They are deep - behind them is a personal drama, each has its own reality and its own past, which, under their villainy, they do not want to change, but want to remain so.The film is definitely worth watching. And of course they made hints about the future of Spider-Man. I think there will be a sequel.", "My childhood": "This is not Only a movie, this is the first time i felt my childhood was over. At the same time, the childhood of at least 3 generations is preserved in the film. This is amazing.", "The Best Spider-Man Movie Ever": "Though there are many reasons why I would say it is the best Spider-Man movie ever, all I will say, is that it was original, unique, and extremely refreshing to see a superhero movie with a plot line that kept your eyes from blinking.", "Spider fever": "Great movie, very entertaining. However, if the first part is great (cinematic, rythm, plot...), The second half kind of lost a lot of interest in my opinion. The overload of Disney \"political correct\", the overload of fan service, the easy conclusion and almost stupid kindness of the characters once again leave a flavourless taste to this movie. The whole curring stuff, grief bound and whatever seem very flat and tbh almost stupid. It is still a cool movie, fun to watch but definitely not worth the rates I am seeing on this website, definitely not. The plot and the whole movie has flaws definitely, so it just doesn't deserve to have so many high praises like it's one of the best movies of all time, even tho it is worth watching for sure.", "8 For Nostalgia": "Let's be honest here, the writing in this movie was abysmal. This movie did not need to exist at all, it does nothing to advance any storyline other than knowing there are alternate universes out there. The plot only advances because Peter wants his friends to go to college. Seriously?! But the last half and seeing all of those old familiar faces warmed my heart and I had a good time. The movie just wasn't necessary though.", "They did it!": "They did it! The Spider-Man trilogy has finally landed! Spider-Man: No Way Home is a spectacular action climax to the films that came before it, with a compelling storyline, gripping, ludicrous moments and dramatic aftermath. The initial climb is a bit slow, but it's an exhilarating ride when everyone starts to rock. I don't know exactly how you hold this film after a few viewings as there are some plot points that don't come across at all when you start thinking about them, but I thoroughly enjoyed it the first time around.", "Brainwash education": "I could see lots of parallels with todays inaccurate media reporting and this movie. Like they are tying very hard to make people believe, that there are only good guys and dumb public in this world. It is the same message we have been served on all platforms these last two years. So I stopped watching somewhere in the middle. Soon after John Jonah Jameson selling the supplements.", "There is nothing except Tobey and Garfield.": "There is nothing except Tobey and Garfield. I'm fed up with the endless gags of the Marvel Universe. I hope that Marvel can focus on the movie itself, rather than opportunistic, focus on how to market. Also, I'm glad to see Tobey Spider-Man on the screen again many years later. But the way he played was very sloppy. I know a lot of Marvel fans are happy to give high marks because of the three Spider-Man, but this movie, except for the three Spider-Man, is not exciting anywhere, and even has a very, very duo.", "WOW!!!": "It 's not a movie , it 's something . The last time I saw something like this , when watching the last parts of the Avengers , so many plot twists , just bravo , I didn 't think I would be so pleased with the film .", "Marvel did it again. Every thing we wished for... and more.": "I only write reviews on very rare occasions.This is one of them.The hype that the movie got with each trailer was immense. And of course expectations started to arouse.But what should I say: It exceeded those expectations.It went differently than I thought but was even better than I could've imagined.Marvel did it again. They concluded a big era of three generations of Spider-Men.Emotionally challenging, visually amazing, greatly acted, purely entertaining. I was extremely happy and sad when it was over.THANK YOU, Marvel (and Sony).It was one of the greatest cinema experience in my whole life.", "Such an entertainment": "Wow I really liked the movie and you can't wait to see the next part. Worth watching and don't miss it.Peter Parker is the best.I'm looking forward to seeing the second part.", "7/10 and heres why": "10/10 for action\n4/10 for the corny dialogue\n4/10 for the overall cheesiness\n10/10 for nostalgia\nlets be real, marvel movies are known for being corny so that aside this was a really great film, but it was only able to be this enjoyable because of the nostalgia of bringing back old characters that we grew up with. Of COURSE we're going to go crazy at GREEN GOBLIN AND SANDMAN ??????? Tobey maguire ???? Helloooooo ? Its been almost 20 years why wouldnt we be crying ? Cheap way to build a buzz in my opinion but it worked because i loved it.", "Payk": "The third part, of course, can be called a sweet valentine to all the Spider franchises, but it lacks the main thing - the processing of enthusiasm, the movie magic that made the Raimi trilogy and Webb's dulogy so memorable. For a film that seems to absorb the best of each part, it is shot outrageously simply: no tricky editing from the 00s, no spectacular flights from the Garfield series - a highly concentrated Marvel, where action scenes are from outsourced graphic masters. No Way Home's best visuals are the ones with Doctor Strange's figures, and all of these episodes, reminiscent of a teaser for the upcoming \"Multiverse of Madness\", are far more captivating than the Spider-Man battles against the Sinister Six. In this sense, \"No Way Home\" is likely to repeat the fate of another popular hit - \"Avengers: Endgame.\" The conclusion of the superhero team saga became one of the highest-grossing films in history, broke records in forum discussions, but after a few months and a couple of new parts of the Marvel universe, it felt like it had sunk into oblivion, remaining an important, but still episode of a giant series . The third \"Spider-Man\" is also an intermediate movie, linking, say, the new \"Doctor Strange\", the continuation of \"Venom\" and other important branches of the franchise. The uniqueness of the events is lost when you realize that they are only a small part in the giant comic book universe.", "Like": "Oddly enough, No Way Home is not only good as a massive and emotionally powerful crossover, but also as Spider-Holland's personal story. The film manages not only not to fall apart, as it did with the Enemy in Reflection and High Voltage, while having a significantly larger number of characters, but also to move the story further, to a completely new level, opening up almost limitless opportunities for the creators to turn Holland into a TRUE Human. -spider. And speaking of which, Holland is just superb here. Yes, his character is sometimes dumb and it doesn't always look adequate, but he manages to reach an emotional peak in terms of revealing his character and taking it to a new level.Again, I will only be glad if this trend continues in the future. Otherwise, this film is a fan service triumph at its best. This is one of those rare examples where references are not only appropriate, they are necessary, as they bring the film to life. Moreover, the film manages to do well both with the good moments of past trilogies and transform their bad moments. So, Molina and Defoe hardly changed, since they were almost perfect from the beginning, and Fox underwent serious changes, which only affected the hero for the better, and this is how everything that happens in the film can be described.To summarize, the creators did a great job. Not only finally and triumphantly retired (seemingly) already legendary old people, but also showed that they have ambitious plans for the future. This is both disturbing and inspiring at the same time.", "Personally my opinion": "The film, Spider-Man Has No Way Home, is the most anticipated by me in 2021. At the beginning of the film, everything is crumpled and incomprehensible, but this is literally 10-15 minutes. In this part, a lot of characters have been revealed, as well as this is the absolute opposite of past yilma Marvel. I want to say that all my expectations were justified and I definitely advise you to watch it.", "Fan service ruins the entire movie": "First part of the movie is cute and intriguing then somewhere near the middle they decided that every single scene was going to be filled with references to previous movies. Fan service doesn't have to be bad but when every other line is a callback to older movies I just lose interest. Even if you completely ignore the fan service and only watch it for the story the movie disappoints. The overall story is very meh and the main objective feels really dumb. The fights are lackluster but atleast they look cool.Also, Dr Strange is so out of character it hurts.", "It's blew my MIND!!": "The way its able to delivered the hype people had for this movie even before the teaser was released, IT DOES BLEW MY MIND. Wow. This is what you get when something made by fans of comic books, the movies and this character, there is a reason why Spider-Man is best superhero there is and this movie just proved why.", "Spider-Man!": "After the end of the \"Avengers\" story, I finally lost, so not too strong, interest in the Marvel universe, and I was sure that the \"Finale\" was the last, noteworthy film of the franchise. Dubious stories about Shang-Chi and the Eternals only confirmed the theory. But the incredible hype around the third spider movie and the warm attitude towards the hero himself made me wait for \"There is no way home\", and even go to the premiere.According to the plot, after the whole world found out who was hiding behind the spider mask (I hope this is not a spoiler for anyone), Peter Parker's life turned into a nightmare. Journalists and onlookers do not give a pass, plus not everyone considers him a hero, which has an extremely negative impact on the quality of life of Peter, his girlfriend MJ and best friend Ned. Using his connections with Doctor Strange, Parker asks him to help with magic, but everything goes a little wrong.It's quite difficult to explain the charm of this movie without spoilers, but betting on nostalgia for familiar characters and numerous references and memes definitely worked even for ordinary people like me, and even more so for ardent fans of the franchise. A kind of hurry, ala \"Friends. Reunion\", but only within the superhero Spider universe. Moreover, all this is done with taste, quite harmoniously, and at the right time of the development of the universe (well, or universes). A logical question arises: if you remove the game on the emotions of older viewers, and the whole fan setting, will there be at least something left? Definitely, yes. \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is even without this one of the best Marvel films, with the right proportion of drama and humor, and with harmoniously developing characters that are nice to look at. Well, the main indicator of the quality of such a movie is the lack of desire to look for flaws and stupidities in the plot, of which there are certainly many. But for such a crossover, you can forgive everything.I remember my emotions perfectly well when in 2002 I asked my parents for my first DVD with the movie \"Spider-Man\" by Sam Raimi as a gift. Then Peter Parker, our good-natured neighbor, became my favorite superhero, and after 20 years nothing has changed. I would like to thank the creators of \"There is no way Home\" for allowing us to feel similar feelings for a short time. I was firmly convinced that nothing could surprise me in the world of superhero cinema for a long time, but I was mistaken, which I am very happy about.", "Paisa vasul movie par...": "I was very happy when those 2 came. But, i still don't understand why peter told dr. Strange to remove his name from peoples mind. He could just say to him, \"Dr. Strange, make spell in which people forget that i am spiderman. Not that i am peter Parker.\" Because, it was big issue that world knew peter parker is spiderman. Everything was very confusing. That's why i just gave 9 out of 10.", "Great moments among bad writing": "I wanted to love this movie. Too much of a focus on cramming in characters and fight scenes, not enough time spent on what should have been really big moments. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't good.", "Where it's good it's really good. Where it's bad it's really bad.": "I really liked a lot of the aspects of the movie. Great concept, most of the jokes made me at least smile, very immersive movie.Some of the more mediocre things: fan service is totally out of control. Not as bad as I expected to be honest and after all came out as positive, but it had a bad taste to it.And now the one thing no one can change my mind about: this is a Disney movie. And by Disney movie I doesn't mean it's made by them, I mean it's childish. Suddenly our goal is to 'cure' all the bad guys as they are just 'victims' and by the end it really happens. This was kind of awkward in a sense because I was imagining these kind of things when I was like three, sure it worked against nightmares with Gargamel as the guest star, becoming friends with him and stuff but please don't do this in a Marvel movie.And then there was the part where I've gone 'what?' which is the Liberty Statue's new version, which just straight up means the opposite then the original.Overall I cannot really blame it because as I said it's really great where it's great, but most of the times it felt pointless.", "Unbelievable story line!!!!": "I'm a massive fan of all comic book hero's and this film brought us all the best performers to be Spider-Man in one film, Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland have done themselves proud with their own films and then to be together in this film was what every fan like me would never have dreamed of happening but it has and I was blown away by it. Then you bring in their biggest enemies from each film which makes it even more interesting to watch time and time again bring on the next step of marvel's plans for post avengers WOW I cannot wait to see what happens next \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "OMG!": "No Way Home is entirely about Peter Parker and the difficult moral dilemmas he has to face. Neither Doctor Strange nor the guests from previous film adaptations divert the focus of the story. For too long the hero has run from the great responsibility, too often got away with it - it's time to finally learn the lesson and grow up. While it's still a Marvel blockbuster with the obligatory cascade of gags, it's more dramatic than most of the studio's titles. Problems pile on top of Peter, one on top of the other, and their weight is felt. Basically, of course, the efforts of Tom Holland. Over the past couple of years, even inveterate skeptics could see that he is not just a cute kid with puppy eyes, but also a talented actor - thanks to the dramas Downhill and The Devil Is Always Here. \"No Way Home\" allows him to demonstrate his abilities to the fullest - here is fear, and anger, and powerlessness, and a whole palette of emotions that this Spider could not boast of before, because he did not give the script.", "Wow wow wow.....But I have questions": "I am the biggest Spiderman fan boy and wow. For me that was the best MCU film. Couldn't fault it. But I have soooooo many questions. Is that Spiderman out of the avengers now? Did the spell Dr Strange cast only effect people of earth? So technically the guardians. Thor and Fury would know who Peter is. I really really hope we see another Tom Holland Spiderman in the future. From start to finish the best ever Spiderman film so far. Well worth the wait.", "the movie is great": "What cinemas were made for. I wasn't expecting something quite as amazing as this, this was two and a half hours of incredible entertainment, drama, laughs, tears and action galore, there truly was something for everyone here.This movie really has ignited my love for the franchise once again, and I am truly excited for what comes next.Nostalgia, there seems to be a real thirst for it theses days, and there is a lot of it to enjoy here. There are plenty of moments throughout that will have you speechless, they really do break all of the rules here.This is one incredibly good looking movie, dazzling special effects, dizzying action scenes, two and a half hours will literally fly by.", "Spiderman. There is no way home": "Peter Parker's life and reputation are under threat as Mysterio has revealed the secret of Spider-Man's identity to the whole world. Trying to fix the situation, Peter turns to Stephen Strange for help, but soon everything becomes much more dangerous.The film has an incredible idea, plot, special effects, script, staging, humor, acting, an interesting storyline and the idea itself.", "Nostalgia and no more": "Yes, and it's the nostalgia that makes this film even better. Marvel as always on top, effects, plot and more. But how nice it is to see old heroes, to remember childhood and Spider-Man on STS! A light film that absorbed the canonical characters!", "Tonally Confused Mess": "I went in thinking this film was gonna be okay. It's always nice to see familiar faces, but when you tell a messy story it doesn't make sense to bring them back does it? What it turned out to be was just a mess (and I hate saying this because I wanted to like it).There weren't many scenes with Peter and Aunt May before this movie that set up a rich relationship. If there were, the payoff with Aunt May dying in the film would have had a much bigger impact. While all in the midst of the tragedy that took place, they brought in the other 2 Spider-Men and had a bunch of humor during what should be a darker period of Holland's Spider-Man's life. Why not sit back and struggle with that reality? Instead we got 10 minutes of sadness and 30 minutes of memes.Clearly Disney and Marvel are drifting away from the art of filmmaking and replacing it with tonally confused hot garbage.Again, I wanted to like this film, but I'm just confused as to why they made it. I guess what audiences want now is fan service, escapist films, and memes.", "Too much teenage oriented": "Compared with earlier Spider-Man movies, I found this one to be the most teenage-oriented and boring. The scenes where characters reflected on their thoughts and emotions seemed to go on and on. Wish it were at least 30 minutes shorter and had a more gender-balanced super hero distribution. I have rarely disagreed with IMDb ratings as much as I do for this one.", "Fans would go Berserk!!!!!!!...Ballistic!!!!!!!": "Marvel has absolutely outdone itself!!!!!!.....This movie is an ode to all the super-fans out there. An absolute ode!!!!!..... Its like, all u had to do was wish and they would make it true!!!!!........ It made me cheer as much as I did during watching Endgame!!!!!....Probably more!!!!....There was more than a dozen times that I wanted to rewind and watch a particular scene again, but Alas!!!!....All I want to say without giving out any spoilers is \"Thank You\"\nThank You!!!!!", "It's trilogy we all hoped for.": "So close to Christmas and all MCU fans got their gift early with an amazing movie that I never thought would happen. Got all the actors together for a performance that will be talked about for years to come. Even sprinkle some Daredevil too. Can't wait to see what comes next.", "Unquestionably best Spiderman movie to date": "Everything you wanted to see happen from all the different versions with all the Spidermen rolled up into an action filled movie! If you liked any of the Spiderman movies this is the movie for you.", "Tonally confused, bur thoroughly entertaining": "Overall I enjoyed it. But the emotional moments fail to deliver since they are usually followed up with quirky marvel funny moments. Aunt May's death for example comes out of nowhere and is delivered in a way that is nearly laughable. We are supposed to feel sad and bad for Peter, but the movie doesn't give us a chance. Next scene we are already having fun with the spiderbros.", "This movie is great! Especially for Spider-Man fans!": "Those who like Spider-Man will definitely like this one! Childhood memories!I think in addition to the three spiders that have been spoiled in advance, the most important thing is the growth of the Holland version of Spider-Man. Many people think that the Spider-Man movie is becoming more and more for children, especially the Holland version is a high school students. But this movie you can see his growth, and basically has a very appropriate response to those negative criticism of the Holland version of Spider-Man, it is worth watching!The movie is great!", "The BEST Spiderman ever made to date": "If you've seen it, you know why the title. If you haven't... GO WATCH IT NOW!No corners were cut. Everything was written brilliantly. The acting was next level. It made me feel every emotion in the book.

Maybe take your pet they might get something out of it.", "Spoilers and Ideas ahead": "9.2 out of 10 Besides what could've been an extra scene, Spiderman No Way Home was awesome....the only thing I feel could've been better, is they could've and should've made this a 2 to even 3 movie film on its own, (I think 2 films, or a 4 hr story would've been more appropriate). No matter how many they made, or make, I feel Gwens' death will always take precedence of the others for loss and heartache, and Mays' in this one next. Now about the Venom ending...A hilarious twist would be venom being transferred back to his universe and going ocd on about seeing spiderman (Tom) then ..to find out he is in the same universe as Garfields Spider man, since tobey already had his, and introduces garfield to his mj through the story as well.", "Is this the best spider-man movie?": "Well mabey, it does far better in almost every aspect than any exept possibly into the spiderverse.

It's just a masterpiece worthy of everyone's attention.Definitely my favorite spider-man is Andrew Garfield! The best man and the best actor for the role of Spider-Man!!!I recommend everyone to watch this movie, but before you go, be sure to remember all the previous parts, there are a lot of Easter eggs and references to them)))", "Only one thing could've made this movie better for me": "Warning spoilersA wonderful expansion of the spider verse . So good to see the other spider guys but what would've made it over the top for me was if Nicholas Hammond had also appeared , just walking by offering advice perhaps but alas no .

I don't want to say anything else, because it's better to see for yourself!!! But I was very surprised, it was a real gift to the fans of these films. In addition, as is usually the case with Marvel, I managed to shed a tear at some points. So I really advise you, you won't regret it!!!Also, there are a lot of jokes in the film, the actors are wonderful!In general, I want to say that many have overestimated this film too much, but I can say that you will definitely like it, you will not be disappointed!!!", "An Absolute Must-see": "Starting right away with very high stakes and a very unclear future for our friendly neighborhood spiderman, this movie shows the troubles and the burdens Peter Parker has to overcome, having his identity revealed. In his efforts to have a normal life, all \"multiverse\" breaks loose and that is how three generations of fans united and celebrated this phenomenon. Villains from the past wandering around like ghosts, Super-heroes slinging into the MCU to unite with their own self. That's right. Our three friendly spider-men together saving the multiverse from destroying reality. (At least for this chapter of the multiverse). Even with a tight schedule and the covid restrictions the amazing teams of Sony and marvel managed to create a perfect movie.

It's very cool to watch a story that reunites the previous parts as well. A lot of references, subtle jokes and phrases that fans are so familiar with, I can safely say will make anyone interested in this picture. But also many references may play a negative role, because a person who is not ready will not understand many phrases, movements and looks, and will miss the sense the directors put into it. I would also like to mention the stunning acting. Despite the fact that the good old spiders were forced to play in an atmosphere they are not quite familiar with, they were amazingly get acquainted with the role, and played a 10 out of 10. Very also not insignificant is the special effects. The work of the people in charge of the special effects was executed flawlessly, which just confirms the professionalism of Marvel. If I had been asked to evaluate the film in general, I would have given it a 10 out of 10, the highest score, without any doubts.", "10 spiders of 10": "How to describe in words a film that caused you just a storm of real, genuine emotions?

How to describe all this? 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' is an absolutely unique film event that probably won't happen again in our lifetime.

To keep this review spoiler-free it will have to be brief. Seeing iconic characters come back after so long, some even almost from 2 decades ago like Doc Ock and Green Goblin was just incredible. (That wasn't a spoiler as they were in the trailers) I highly recommend rewatching all the spiderman movies old and new just to get a refresher as events from those two movies are mentioned throughout. Probably one of the most awesome cinema experiences since Avengers: Endgame.

And when everyone forgets Peter Parker including his girlfriend MJ.", "Great movie, delivered what we wanted, but...": "The script is not the most ambitious by any means, but the director make sure that the idea has been very well executed. Magistral acting by Tom Holland, delivering a range of emotions with precision through the trama. Willem Dafoe plays the Green Goblin sensationally too, best villain shot in the movie, and one of the best villain impressions ever. Tobey Maguire showed why we love him again and Andrew Garfield had a great performance as well, a shame to see that they get such a little screen time. The main problem was their introduction in the movie, it will be way cooler if they appear in a crucial point, attracted by some fight. The fact that Spider-Man gathered all the villains just to release them is a little questionable as well, they could have done the same plot using another method. The Sandman personality change also were something a little rough. In a overall view, the movie delivered what the trailers promised: a lot of action with our beloved characters. Could've been better, but it worked very well anyway.", "Full buffet of delight": "Watching this movie feels like youre on a buffet.

What a film. It crushed all of my expectations, leaving me stunned and speechless by the end of the film.My showtime was sold-out, and my god, were the reactions incredible. From the first ten minutes of the film to the final five, I've never experienced anything like it. I'd compare it to Avengers: Endgame crowd reactions. The film managed to seamlessly bring back our beloved Spider-Man characters that we grew up with (Yes, Andrew and Tobey are back!), while maintaining the same look and feel of Holland's previous Spider-Man films.Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Holland's chemistry was very well-rounded, with occasional bits of comedy put at just the right times. If you liked \"Dr. Strange\", you will definitely enjoy this film, as it ties into \"Dr. Strange\"'s aesthetic incredibly.Holland's chemistry with Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire is unmatched and reminded me of a sibling or brotherly bond. In terms of action sequences, the three Spider-Men carried in their own ways, giving the crowd plenty of action and energy, but never overpowering each other. Just a beautiful blend, here.Overall, \"Spider-Man No Way Home\" was incredibly enjoyable, and I would highly recommend and encourage you to watch this film in theatres (if that opportunity is available to you). Dare I say, it's better than Avengers: Endgame...", "Waste of time and money": "Can't believe paid real money to watch it in a theatre. Wish I could turn back time and not make that mistake.Sad thing is the franchise is just riding on few good movies and try max it can to mint money without story or anything.", "Silly movie for kids. Adults shouldn't expect much.": "Every twist and turn were silly, resulted from silly decisions of Spiderman. It's acceptable for kids. Viewers should be warned to set their expectations accordingly.", "Alright movie": "This movie is definitely a love or hate film. You go through a rollercoaster of emotions, furthermore the 3 Spider-Man's being brought together bringing together 3 generations of Spider-Man fans was great especially since they all got on so well and they really jelled. However some of the movie was floored especially the plot which was really quite irritating, why did Peter have to interrupt dr strange 5 times and cause this whole situation, if he didn't do that he would of still got into college in the future either when nick fury came back to earth or when the whole situation died down. Instead he unleashed a domino effect of villains coming to his world which in turn resulted in his aunt dying for what you can say in a way was for nothing. Except for that I think it was a good film which definitely deserves a 7/10 rating.", "Okay, not that great": "Spider-Man is my favorite Marvel superhero. I just wanted to start by saying that. I love his suit, his powers, his spunk. Pros: Tom Holland was better in this film than the first two, but I still don't love him in the role. This movie was better than the first two in this series, but not great. Some of the characters are great to see again. Some of the teenage/young adult elements are fun and true to life. The end credit scene is pretty cool\nCons: Too many villains, the reveals don't feel deserved, and it really just is a 6/10 film. Better than some superhero films, worse than others. Zendaya is ok, doesn't feel like MJ. Aunt May is not really Aunt May in this either. Having Doctor Strange in the film made it more interesting, but it also took away from Spider-Man himself. Too convoluted really - not trying to spoil it, but the characters are just too many to have an engaging storyline. The storyline is based on a silly premise and doesn't feel like the movie should be so long based off of it.", "Brilliantly packed.": "They did cut short the character arcs for a few villains: the lizard, electro and such, but still managed to maintain a gripping story running through nostalgia worth two decades. Filled with somewhat shallow humour at times with the memes and such but, it was nonetheless the movie needed to correct Tom Holland's Spider-Man - showing genuinely how a Spider-Man movie should be as opposed to a marvel centred one. Proud of marvel for this one, and surprisingly agreeing with the general hype surrounding this one. Worth it!", "What a moive": "Absolutely brilliant, a must watch movie that lives upto the hype and takes it to the next level with twists and turns and thats all im gonna say.Go see it now.", "It was an amazing movie": "This movie was amazing and so fun to Watch .

It's a Spider-Man movie with all the OG spider-Men plus Tom's Spider-Man. I'd watch it again when i get the chance to. But until then, i think i am going to ''Stick'' with theory videos on YouTube.", "Eh decent": "As much as I understand what was good about this film. I just don't buy into it. I understand people are crazy to see so many nostalgic characters come back like Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, it just feels like to me if they weren't involved in the film, it would be another mediocre superhero film. Seeing original villains and cool scenes makes the film exciting and the second half of the film was exciting. But the first half was slow and a bit boring to be honest.", "Gladdens an older fans heart": "I know there are thousands of reviews for this movie and maybe no one sees this, but anyway, I needed to say something. I'm over 50 and this is the best Spiderman movie I've seen. I realize there is some nostalgia talking here but even so, this movie delivered and did it well.", "Good, but not great": "I like Tom Holland as Spider-Man and enjoyed the character in the Avenger series but the recent Spider-Man series of films have run flat for me and this film had the same effect. The whole film lacked an edge for me and it felt like a Disney movie with an attempt at humour that was miss placed. There lacked a congruence to the whole film and a lack of emotional integrity. It was a nice touch bringing in Tobey and Andrew to play there part but that felt like it was under utilised.I'm hoping this phase of marvel films picks up the intensity and pace with Dr Strange and the multi verse, Guardians of the galaxy part 3, Thor love and thunder and the new Captain Marvel film.", "Best Spider-Man movie.": "Add a pinch of Iron Man,a pinch of Captain America,and then you have the best Spider-Man movie ever made.Such a breathtaking pre-christmas/new year treat from Marvel for its fans!\u2764\nThe whole cast did an amazing job.

I mean those 2 don't even relate\n2. He defeats doctor strange\nThe other ridiculous thing is the acting when he meets the other spiderman. They seem akward and cheesy.

Peter went to Doctor Strange asking for his help to make the world forget he's Spider Man. However when a spell went wrong, Peter and his friends has to face the different Spider-Man villains and send them back to their universe.Before I watched this film, I watched the Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield's movies. Seeing the villains in the movie defiantly gave me feels. There was a point in the movie when Peter faced Doc Oc and he said \"what have you done with my machine?\" Hearing the reference from Spider-Man 2 did make me feel nostalgic. Tom Holland is an amazing actor, but I think in this film you truly see how great an actor he is. Adding Benedict Cumberbatch to this film was a great treat. When he creates his magic is always spectacular to watch and has me excited to see more of him in his sequel.All I'm going to say is, if you haven't seen it yet, go watch it.

I can't say the same about Otto or Strange, they became a joke for this film, the secondary characters are decent except for ned and MJ, the worst characters in the three movies. There are some inconsistencies with the.", "Decent": "It's a decent movie, but no way it's the most hit marvels movie, it always will be avengers, avengers was always will be the most grossing and Tony stark and captain America can no way be overthrown by a spidey boy.

Lord of stuff was over the top and honestly Tobey was unsatisfying. Andrew Garfield was the best part of the movie. Jamie fox shouldn't play a villain, he seems too nice. Lizard and sandman weren't done justice. Doc oc and green goblin were the best but I can't remember if the green goblin was that over the top. Fine movie, fine ending, #MTAS3.", "Greatest Fan's serviece for all Spider-Man fans.": "This movie is very fabalous. It has a lot a fans serviece for all spider-man fans. The story is very incredible to follow what happend with Peter Parker and MJ after Mysterio told everybody that Peter Parker is Spiderman. After this all chaos story that he faced. So He asks Dr. Strange to cast a spell to make everyone forget he is Spider-Man. But things go horribly wrong, and the multiverse suddenly gets very real indeed. After I told a storyline, I think we can predict what will happend in this movies. But in trailer,we will see Doctor Octopus is appear. This is a huge fan-serviece for old school spider fans receive. And In movie, You will see a biggest fan-servieces for all spider-man fans that you might not thinking before. And then We will see how Peter Parker growing up after everything ends and show us he is not kid anymore and show his responibilities to stand by himself. Not be Tony Strak's boy anymore. And I think you should watch this movie. I very recomended you should watch because the storyline and one of the part that make this movie so fabalous is special effect. The special fx is make this movie more realistic. People can feel and imagine with the movie easily. Not even storyline and special effect but also music theme for this movie is masterpiece. Because in every scene than have music, we can feel what situation is and enjoy with movie very much. It was very enjoyable to watch in the cinema. I think didn't felt like a 2.20 hours movie because it is superbly entertaining. Directing was terrific due to superb pacing - every minute of this movie wasn't boring or anything. I'm very sure you will enjoy with this movie very much. Hope you will enjoy my review and happy to watch the trilogy of Spider-Man Tom Holland ver. :)", "One of the best MCU films!": "As a person who always dissects Marvel trailers and films, I can tell that this movie is by far one of the greatest that's been seen on the big screen. The problem I have with it which bumped it down to an 8/10 is the fact that the first 50 minutes or so felt rather rushed and unlike an average marvel movie. After that, it began to move at a better and slower pace, also incorporating key details and aspects which added intrigue and interest.I'd say that if they turned it from a 2 hour and 30 minute movie to roughly 2 hours and 50 minutes just fix that first 1/3 of the movie, it'd make it just the more better. As for the rest of the film, it was greatly developed and created. Seeing the theatre's reaction between everyone sniffling and crying or cheering when they got to see a certain face such as Doc Ock's return (not a spoiler, seen in trailer) made it such a great experience.I'd definitely recommend watching this film when you get the chance. Don't take the wait and watch it in theatres now, I seriously couldn't have asked for more. This put the trilogy to a great and devastating conclusion before the 2nd trilogy with closure between characters and remarkable action take. The story wrapped up on Peter as a character as he figures out the sacrifices required to be Spider-Man. Now he must remember the fine words spoken, \"With great power, comes great responsibility,\" as you watch him in the incredible and well above amazing film; Spider Man: No Way Home.", "Wooow": "Spider man with no way home and a love letter to the fans of the character, besides striking and certainly unforgettable. Bringing old characters back but not forgetting those who gave life to this film, making none of them forgotten. With impeccable performances especially those of tom holland and willem dafoe, a lot of emotion and nostalgia involved and many other merits, I can say that this is certainly one of the best marvel movies.", "Genuinely fun time!": "I hadn't seen a Spider-Man movie since Tobey Maguire, and was thoroughly excited to see how the franchise has evolved. An all around good time and good story.", "Still crying from how good that was": "This is easily the best live action super hero movie ever made. It created a full circle back to the undisputed veggie I got of modern super hero films. Wow, thanks MCU for being radical and killing it at the same time!!!!!!!!", "Spider-Man Endgame": "This is the BEST Spider-Man movie. The action is gritty, the tone is dark and the ending is extremely heartfelt. Tom Holland gives a career best performance. P. S the fan service in this movie is Beyond Next Level.", "My Review": "If you enjoyed Spider-Man: Far from Home, then you will greatly enjoy the sequel to follow up the events, Spider-Man: No way Home. The movie stars Spider-Man struggling to conceal his identity and accidentally unleashing other villains from other universes that are out to kill him. After Peter attempts to convince Doctor Strange, to do a spell that has it where everyone forgets who is identity is except his loved ones but doing causes the multiverse to be disrupted. Through the movie, Peter learns that he cannot have everything the way it is as a hero and learns that you must be willing to sacrifice you relationships to ensure the safety of those that you dearly care about.Looking back on the film, there are a good amount of pros. For one, they give Peter Parker good character development which helps us to understand the decisions that he makes and why he makes them. We also get character development to other characters like Ned, MJ, Otto, and the two versions of Peter Parker that we see towards the end. Even the villains have a good development which we do always see in other films, this film primarily does good on it. The climax towards the end truly shows us the sacrifices that Peter makes in order to keep everyone that he cares about despite him now no longer being in their lives.I can't really touch upon any cons in the books but my only complaint would just be for more fight sequences even though we got a good amount of them. This is also my personal opinion but I think characters like Daredevil and Venom should have gotten a bit more screen time rather than them only being around for one scene. Ultimately not too much to complain about with this film.Overall this film was really good and definitely put the main conclusion on all three of the Spider-Man trilogies. I look forward to more movies related to Spider-Man in the future and hopefully, then they'll add more main characters. I give this movie a 9 out of 10 stars.", "Spider-Man Movie!!": "This movie celebrates Spider-Man life and legacy if your fan for years this movie for you it was experience like no other to see people in the audience go crazy that's what cinema all about.", "One of the best if not the best": "Easily the best Tom Holland spiderman film out of the three, and definitely gives spiderman 2 and into the spiderverse a run for there money as the best spiderman movie of all time is it the perfect movie no and I think it would be silly to suggest it is but what it does get right is brilliant the film is similar to endgame in the sense that it starts off quite slow and the middle drags a little but all building up to the amazing climax which I won't spoil but Is worth the wait, I'll be honest I've never really warmed to Tom Hollands version of spiderman until now in this movie he really grows as a character and hopefully will continue to if he returns in future films, Now on to the film the villains brought back are great Defoe is my personal highlight of the film amazing once again as green goblin especially when he loses the mask, the action scenes are brilliant but there are quite alot of overdone dialogue scenes which can drag a little but all the characters get quite alot of screen time and none feel like there in the film just to be there they all have a purpose Ned and MJ especially all in all a great fan service and amazing film which will exceed expectations and live long in the memory not only for new spiderman fans but old as well 8/10.", "BEST SPIDER-MAN FILM": "Endless emotions, if they hadn't already spoiled it, it would have been fantastic, breathtaking and moving scenes, hands down the best spider-man movie.", "so close, yet so far..": "This movie has many elements that beg to be change/tweaked. It really keeps the movie from perfection and being the best of the MCU. Pacing is the smallest issue with this movie, the first act being the slowest, and the second dragging, making the movie seem longer than it is. Next problem I have is the way that Tobey and Andrew were introduced. Ugh! Why just why?! This could had been soooo spectacular and no it just wasn't it simple relied on your love of the characters to carry the scene and while it worked it wasn't impactful. Lastly is this director and his horribly bland shots, while there are some great shots in the movie, the dialogue scenes suffer the most from this boring style. What worked, worked. The acting was all there, especially from William Defoe as green goblin, and Andrew Garfields Spider-Man. Overall this movie was fun and while it easily could've been the best Spider-Man movie it doesn't come close.", "Treat for Spiderman fans": "After being so hyped, expectations was higher. And guess what it didn't disappoint me. As a marvel fan this is what I expect from a marvel movie. Simply fantastic. Reunion of all the Spiderman specially the tobby (one and only spidy for 90's kid) was awesome idea. This is the result of combining two best in the business ( sony & marvel). Overwhelmed. Superb. Great work.", "Overrrrrrrrrated": "I love mcu and I was very excited to watch this movie and the good ratings really raised my expectations.....bi think thus is the most overrated movie in the entire franchise.", "Do stock": "Really good.

Made for a slow boring start to the movie. If the movie didn't start so poorly I probably would have rated the movie a 6 because the second half was an okay superhero movie. It's in keeping with Marvel's campy scripts, acting etc. Tom Holland makes a good spider man. Making him the guiding light is pushing it. He's super immature and really should have been guided by Tobey Maquire's spider man. The ending of the movie gives you hope that they'll return to spider man not the iron spider this series seemed to be pushing. I'd like to see the supporting cast improved if they do produce another movie. If they do produce more I'll definitely wait for it to hit the streaming services and won't pay to see it.", "Enjoyable but pointless": "The main thing to note about Spider Man - No Way Home is that it's highly dependent on how you view the past films. For others who have a greater nostalgia towards them then they would have a more enjoyable reception. For me though I don't really have any strong nostalgia towards both the Tobey Maguire and the Andrew Garfield. Because of this the fan service felt more annoying than and reminded to some extent of Star Wars the Rise of Skywalker. This mainly in how characters seem to quote themselves which for me has always taken me out of the moment. It also felt really unambitious. With the exception of Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus returning characters don't really add much. The returning Spider Men don't really add much apart from verbalize messages Tom Hollands Spider Man is yet to learn. Tonally maguires universe, garfields universe and hollands universe don't really work together. Maguires universe feels very cartoony but not in a bad way. It doesn't try to think about reality which is evident with the fact the maguire can shoot webbing without a gadget and that harry osborn can hear the green goblin. Garfields universe tries to go more realistic, or at least what the creators think is realistic. This can be seen with the webbing done through a gadget but andrew garfields spiderman is notoriously annoying and narcissistic which evidently clear is how the creators think teenagers are like. This aspect of his characterization though is not carried through to no way home. Hollands universe whilst feeling comparatively more realistic than Maguires, is more meta and likes to poke fun at is self. One aspect I didn't like is that what makes bad guys bad is a physical thing that can be taken away. With green goblin from what I remember of the sam raimi films is that Norman is a flawed individual and it is not just the chemical. It also didn't handle the moral question of letting the villains die well as it portrays (Holland's) Spider Man learning that killing isn't the answer but no further though on the fact that the villains will die when they go back to there own dimensions.That's not to say this film has no merit. I did find myself laughing at some of the comedy though some gags felt forced. The VFX was good, especially the trippy fractally mirror dimension stuff.Overall to some up my thoughts the crossover is not justified enough, it adds nothing to any of the returning characters and is unambitious with the only intent to give woops and cheers in the cinema every time a character quotes themselves. Not the worst thing ever and I do see why people can find enjoyment in it but for me I felt so annoyed by its unambitiousness that I left the cinema unironically wishing tobey maguire would have died in the end just cause it would have annoyed a lot of people. If you just want to see tobey maguire again as spiderman then I think you would enjoy it but if you want something more than just the typical hollywood manufactured crowd-pleasers then I don't think you will get much out of it. If this is what the multiverse saga looks like then I'm not sold.", "Exceptional Movie": "Absolutely outstanding. Great story, great cast, a few 'surprises' , truly a great movie. Fans will be delighted and if you've never ventured into this centre before it's still going to entertain you.", "This movie made me happy": "This movie just gave me so much hope for the MCU, and I say that as someone who already likes the universe. Wonderful execution, each character given a satisfying little arc or emotional beat that fit with both them and the overall theme of the movie. Loved it.", "Whatever you say, THIS IS THE BEST SPIDERMAN MOVIE.": "Every scene of it really mesmerizing. Worth every penny. All of the characters have enough screentimes, though there are too many of em.Speak about the MC, I don't really like Tom Holland as Spiderman, but this time, he proves me wrong. He becomes the \"MAN\". THE REAL SPIDER-MAN. What a Chara development.This is more than a popcorn movie, nothing like the prequels. Full of surprises, great and neat storyline. Even darker and saddest.", "Be ready to get disappointed.": "This movie is mediocre at best. Over hyped to the max. The weakest of the trilogy IMO. How can they messed up the writing & plot when you have assembled that whole perfect casts? Such a wasted\nopportunity for what supposed to be the greatest Spider-Man(s) collaboration ever. It feels draggy, cringey at times, lots of unfunny lines, & by the 3rd arc I just look at my phone waiting for it to be done. Doesn't feel the hype whatsoever for the final fight. The problem with Holland's Spider-Man is that through the whole 3 movies he acted like a 3rd grade kid. The only time we can see him mature a bit is by the end of this movie. Something is wrong with MCU these days that I enjoy their TV series more than their movies. If you haven't watch it yet in the theater, I can give you an advise - a line spoken by MJ herself in this movie. \"Expect for a disappointment so that you don't get disappointed\".", "Great film!": "Great film and love the additions to the MCU as well as stars from the past. However, it's clear that some of the scripting is quite bad at times and it really shows and takes away from the experience. Loved the energy in the cinema though, lots of cheers and applause!!", "Simple (complex) Review!": "Obviously by now you've heard this movie's Stella Reputation. But!Does anyone else feel like Peter's (Holland) Journey has been a 3 2 1 experience? As apposed to the 1 2 3 experience that we're accustomed to appreciate as the audience.We like to see progress, we like to appreciate growth in the characters we invest our time and emotions in. And sadly, I'm left feeling a little negative and upset with the ending of this beautiful Movie.Peter's gone from everything, being an Avenger, dad/best friend Tony Stark, Family and Friends... all the way down to having nothing but a few bucks and a Spidey suit. Whilst I completely understand and respect their choices, I'm left feeling empty. Why? Because of a single choice in the movie. A simple choice that could have had me giving this a 10 out of 10 perfection.Why oh why didn't he tell MJ. We know Peter feels responsible for the cut on her head. But if he had told MJ, as the only soul in the world to know, why wouldn't that have been the most perfect way to end the movie. Think how important MJ would be to Peter and to us the Audience. Yes He's Gone from 3 2 1 in HIS Life, with one exception, his relationship with MJ! A little pay off for the final in the franchise.With all that out the way, this is my favourite Movie of all time. I grew up with Spidey in my life, and at 21, to see my hero's back at it again was truly heart lifting. Thanks to all the hard working movie makers out there. A lovely gift to us dear fans.Callum. H.", "A joke": "Never regretted going to the cinema so much. 2 hours and 30 minutes watching horrible story lines, poorly edited fight scenes, awks conversations (like the ones with the 3 Spideys)\nNothing was good, even the poor jokes or the sad moments which were only given a few seconds so not enough for you to even feel sad.So much more could have been done with the multiverse, what a disaster of a movieThe bad guys we knew and loved are disrespected to the core. Wtf was that\nIt's a big no no.", "People don't notice this.": "Strange made a spell to forget all the people Peter Parker is Spiderman but in the end he turned to magic to forget Peter Parker.The first spell could stop everyone coming from the multiverse but they didn't. He did anything to enhance the story. The things that were done could be done in a simple way but they worked the hard way to create extra feeling.Whatever they do and people don't pay attention to it.", "wish id watched it in cinema": "Its just less exciting to see with all the spoilers going on, but sure as someone who barely watch any spiderman movies, i still get why people regard this as a masterpiece-- simply, its a gather of all the people appeared, villans, peter parkers, mjs(mary jane and michelle jones), aunt may , and they all have memorable endings.. i cried somewhat when may died but there are still holes to fix to that. Besides, its all making it this easy to get into MIT, or just to forget everything would save them from not letting them know it tomorrow, or just forgetting someone you love because they made the decision?? It was just a choice, unlike what they called they have no choice. (which is different , from miles morales' situation(from spiderman : into the spider-verse2018)\nAll in all, this movie is quite less mindblowing than spider-verse one, i know saying this is against peter's fans, but truly this movie is overrated a bit for people on the margin of marvel universe like me:) but surely it is 100% better when you are in cinema tho, i alwayslike the ending credits part a lot, and just sitting till the end for the tease is such an experience !!", "Web slinging fun": "Spider-man is always a sure thing for guaranteed entertainment , and this offering is certainly entertaining.

From the start to finish I was hooked, the comedy was brilliant and the hard hitting moments hit the nail on the head. I honestly can't wait to see it again.", "Greatest movie of all time": "Awesome blow mine incredible movie one of the greatest Spider-Man movies ever Marvel took it to the next step without a shadow of a doubt greatest Spider-Man movie of all time\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d.", "When you eat Infinity War for breakfast and Endgame for dinner.": "My goodness! I was prepping myself to be smitten by this movie but boy oh boy was I underestimating! With No Way Home, Marvel Studios, Sony and director Jon Watts may just have made the best superhero movie ever! I remember reading critic reviews saying that this movie is fan service. While I say that they are completely underestimating and underappreciating this masterpiece of a movie, even if you go into the theaters thinking of this as so, you will not be disappointed at all. Somehow, I feel that this is better than my 3 favorite movies: Infinity War, Endgame and The Dark Knight.Each moment of the movie is special. The plot exposition along with the expected and unexpected reveals make this a movie to go whoa about. The people inside the multiplex didn't spare any moment to not shout or clap about. From Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock reveal to the extremely unexpected Supreme Strange reveal in the post credits, this movie was anything but sedate. I cannot describe the feeling of the crowd when Maguire and Garfield's Peters show up.Coming to the movie, it is fantabulous. All the actors have worked their bottoms out. This movie is the right balance of quips, humor and darkness. Things get dark pretty soon. Tom Holland has absolutely nailed it as the new Spidey. Willem Dafoe's approach to the Goblin has always been spectacular and with No Way Home, his interpretation has become even more darker (in a quite Joker-esque fashion). Jamie Foxx's Electro as a power-hungry but human villain was right on the money. Others such as Zendaya, Jacob Batalon and for whatever time we got see Tobey and Andrew, was spot on with their roles.One of the strongest things about this movie is its plot. It has a masterpiece of a plot. The plot twists were very unexpected, especially where Holland's Peter makes the ultimate sacrifice by making everyone forget that he's Spiderman, without any exceptions. This movie not only makes sure that it not only sets up for \"Multiverse of Madness\", but also sets up for immense character-development for MCU's Spidey, for the greater future. The plot of this movie easily prevents it from being an \"Exposition Dump of Maddening Reveals\". The emotional set-pieces of this movie are genuinely hard-hitting and act as an apt reason for the main hero to become what he becomes at the end, i.e., as selfless as the Web-Slinger can be. Aunt May's death was completely unexpected and served as the perfect set-piece for Tom's Parker to do whatever he did. This movies plot goes so vast that the significant emotional moments from the Raimi and Marc Webb movies are also felt in this movie. Andrew's Peter saving Michelle Jones provokes memories of Gwen's death and act as a moment of reckoning and self-peace for him. Tobey stopping Goblin from dying is his moment of self-peace. All-in-all, it was a mix and match everything right and nothing wrong , done in the best possible fashion.Those who've given negative reviews, while I'm not saying that they are unintelligent for doing so, I'm simply not able to understand what was the issue. For the goofs that have been mentioned on this website, I think they are quite self-explanatory in themselves.I hope everyone reading enjoyed my view of this masterpiece. I'll go so far as to say that this movie deserves an Oscar more than any other movie. Not only for it has done, but also for how well has it managed to do what it did at such a large scale.", "Memories.": "Most of the times we expect more from a movie but it turns out to be disappointing but this one is complete opposite, it is the same as I expected it to be maybe better than expectations.It brought back old memories of all the past Spiderman movies I watched and loved, that all came together and made this one unarguably the best movie of 2021.", "Best movie from Marvel in Phase 4": "The best movie from marvel in Phase 4.There were lot of expectations and hype around this movie and they delivered every bit and beyond that . I had one of the best experiences of my life after watching this movie.Best Spider-Man Movie .", "The most incredible superhero film ever": "This movie was insane from start to finish, loved every single second. I watched it twice in the first 2 days and watching it the second time I didnt enjoy it any less or wasn't any less excited, Tom Holland played an incredible role and the whole film was amazing.Spoiler bit:\nTobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were 2 additions the whole world wanted and their parts were played to perfection, Aunt May dying added a really dark twist to the film and it set the rest of the movie up perfectly. Expertly written, expertly acted, best film of all time.", "GREATEST FAN SERVICE EVER!!!!!": "Yes Marvel have perhaps created the greatest fan service movie of all time, this even tops Endgame for me having grew up watching Tobey Maguire as a kid and seeing Andrew Garfield in my teens. For the casual movie/superhero lovers this movie will seem your average superhero flick. Marvel clearly made this one for the fans.Easily the best out of Watts' trilogy, as we see Holland give his best spidey performance to date. The movie was a pure mix of action, emotion and laughter and it hits in all the right places. Michael Giacchinos score is one of this best and needs more recognition I think. The standout performance for me though has to be Willem Dafoe as the menacing Green Goblin, maybe even more frightening than his original performance in Spider-Man (2002), this man has to be due an Oscar soon, his range is out of this world.So thank you Marvel and in particulary Kevin Feige and Amy Pascal for making this work and bringing so much nostalgia to me, making me remember memories of watching the first Spider-Man as a child. I lost count of how many times I had goosebumps watching this and had a massive grin across my face for most of the movie. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!! I will definitely be viewing this time and time again.", "Marvel doing a Marvelous Job": "Coming from a die hard DC Fan, This is a masterpiece. This is once in a lifetime experience full of suprises.

Will see this movie again in the theater!", "Brilliant!!!!": "This had everything a spiderman fan could ever desire to see in a spiderman movie.Loved that we finally got to see Charlie Cox in the MCU who could potentially go on to have his own marval film. This is very exciting for a Netflix's Daredevil series fan. And to see Toby and Andrew's spidermans was unreal feeling.", "good": "Don't watch the trailers. Just watch the movie. I'm not going to say much. It's amazing. And I'm in complete disbelief that it actually happened. Well-made, well-acted, well-directed. Fun, funny and crazy. Can't wait to watch it again.", "No way. Didn't like it. It was fun.": "Moves fast. Too plot based. Villains not got enough lines. Needs more screen time for villains. More dialogue for other spider men. It was tight and concise. I learnt more about Dr strange. Goblin was good and ock good Drama. I didn't think goblins ball bombs and knife sword retractable arm attached were that powerful that it could defeat all 3 spidermen. Garfield didn't fight much. Nor did tobey. Best sequels were t2 and dark Knight. Best part 3 was tobey spider 3. Lethal weapon 4 good. Mission Impossible 3 bad. Die hard 3 good. No way home what does it mean. The villains must get their own movies. The goblin movie. The Osborne movie. The Lizard. Electro. Doc ock. Sandman. Sam raimi spider man and Dr strange movie.", "Banking on the love for Tom Holland and Nostalgia": "Entertaining? Sure. Flash couldnt make it anymore awkward or annoying with his scenes. The character is awful (in this universe). No ill will toward the actor but yikes, he's intolerable. Always has been. This gripe is just me being an a-hole... really, Peter? You fought to save the world, were on other planets. Got dusted.. came back. Helped save the world again... Welp, better go back to school. Relied too much on nostalgia.", "the best!": "This spiderman movie was such a rollercoaster for me! I had so much fun watching this movie, i had to see it on the cinemas thrice. The actors were great, the storyline was great. Tom holland did such a great job :)", "Homework": "The dream of fans becomes a reality - Spider-Men from different generations meet in one film. In terms of Tom Holland, the movie is even bigger than another Marvel's movie Avengers: Endgame, because of its scope. Indeed, there is a contact between the three universities. As far as I am concerned, it is a masterpiece.The action goes right after the previous part, where Spider-Man's identity was revealed. Of course, Peter Parker does not like it, and that is why he wants to change everything back. As always, everything goes wrong, but this time it will cost Peter a lot.Spider-man: No Way Home is a brilliant movie with a unique cast. The plot explores friendship, family ties, and moral choices. The movie came out mostly dramatic, however, there are also some funny moments, including the incarnation of a popular meme. Only special effects in some parts were unrealistic.All in all, Spider-man: No Way Home offers viewers a gripping story with plenty of twists and turns. From the beginning to the end the movie keeps your attention and does not give you time to be bored. The film is relevant for all ages - teenagers continue following Holland's Spidey and adults are nostalgic for the aged Tobey and Andrew.", "The movie is full of goosebumps and my childhood memories... #mustwatch": "All the voice of all characters in hindi are original....\nI can't believe how that's gives me goosebumps...\nAll means all the characters from all SPIDER-MANS MOVIE TO THE MARVELS NETFLIX SERIES....\nliterally all were originally..\nEven Dr strange voice was ALSO original...\nLiterally cried listening there voices again after so many year....\nThe feeling, the expression, there ACCENT all were amazing...\nHeadsoff the sony pictures India...", "Love Love Love": "Growing up watching all Spider-Man films some better some worse, I never thought that Tobey and Andrew were gonna be here, That aside writing, acting, emotion all near perfect, Aunt May dying caught me off guard and that's a good thing setting the stage that anybody could die in this film, I'm going to end this review wanting a The Amazing Spider-Man 3, Andrew Garfield redemption arc is here.", "could have done better and should have...": "Finally watched spider man no way home today , of course i knew the spoilers about 3 spider-man.So there was not plenty of things left to discover in the movie , but this movie actually made him spider-man, character development was awesome.But also there were plenty of plot holes :\n1. How didn't his spidey sense told him something was off during his conversation to mysterio in last movie, then this whole thing would not have even happened.2. if he told dr. Strange to remove the memory of mysterio from whole world , this mess could have been avoided.3. and how the hell did spider man's have knowledge to cure those villains , and if they have then why didn't they did this in previous movies (i.e. Tobey knows a serum to cure green goblin )\nalso visual effects were messy all around the final battle , they definately could have done it better. I am pointing it out because movie wants to sell itself due to its visuals.With almost same budget eternals and shang chi did way better job.I liked the part where he wants to change the heart of these villains instead of just killing them.But they made doctor octavious less horryfying then its origional movie idk why . Those jokes also didn't land for me (also for most of you) , that feels like cringe.Also why didn't venom from tobey maguire universe didn't come , he knew spider man too ?That fight scene in building was freaking awesome. But final battle could have been better. Action choreography was nice , its good too see tom doing his own stunts.Just to clarify i have no nostalgia towards these old spiderman , i have watched them last year only , so i am not gonna judge movie on the basis of nostalgia.I understand your feeling tho , i have seen public reaction on that scene , that was great to see , people having such great time. Final scene still gives me chills. (when he goes to that appartment)\nmy rating - 6/10.", "Amazing Marvel Universe turnaround": "Enjoyed every second of the movie! Hope this great storyline with the same characters will continue in the next couple of movies.Tom Holland and rest of the crew deserves it!", "The best spiderman movie ever": "This is great you will never regret seeing this great movie , and the Credit scenes this is just woooww. And the fighting scene and the music and the cast!! Is amazing truly amazing movie with amazing fighting scenes and amazing ost make this movie 10 out 10.", "One of the best movies to exist": "Simply amazing. A masterpiece that exceeded the highest expectations with its action, comedy and really fun entertaining characters. Marvel just keeps getting better and crazier and anyone who disagrees should watch this movie. I would say that Spider-man: no way home is one of the greatest movies to ever exist. Amazing.", "Just needed the 2nd half": "No spoilers here.Just gonna say I just watched it. Spider-Man 2 still remains the greatest of them all.The first half was like watching a high school short film. Terrible dialogue. Terrible direction. It was sad to see to be honest. Dr. Strange could barely hold it together.Second half was pretty darn good. Not Avengers type. But it was way better than Spider-Man 3 with all they had to put into it. Great action driven by strong emotions.Tom Holland does alright. I think he is the best Spider-Man by far just not the best Peter Parker. That all belongs to the original.I would say go to the theater with lower expectations for the first half.It's nothing like Doctor Strange or the Avengers. It's more like how a b-rated movie starts. Like a rehearsal more than the real thing. Kind of how I saw Black Widow. Just all over the place. Seriously I feel they wanted to show how buff Tom Holland was more than anything. Just fillers and poor jumps from Act 1 to Act 2.So yeah I give it 6.8 stars. Some great things happen in the 2nd half so just stick through it and it'll be worth it.I'll continue to go see each Spider-Man in theaters but I probably wouldn't watch this one again to be honest.", "The best spider man movie yet!": "This movie kept everyone on their seats till the conclusion. When Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield appear through the portal, everyone lost it. People started to clap as they saw Tobey Maguire, oh the emotions. Felt like they created this movie with perfection.", "By comparison makes me like 'Into the Spiderverse' a lot more": "Starts ok but basically this movie is like a child that really wants your attention but since it can't get it on merit it settles for making faces, screaming and crying. Stuff happens - that's pretty much it. Attempts at emotional moments are never deserved and feel like grade schooler saw a couple of movies and wanted to replicate some moments from them not understanding the idea. No amount of strings and piano will help with that if there is no proper build-up on all fronts unless you cater strictly to overemotional teenagers that can cry over seeing other person doing it (or trying to sell it anyway). But at this point it's like shooting fish in a barrel. Not much makes sense here, most jokes fall flat and even then they have to be explained. Overall creators don't give their audience too much credit and that's a little sad. Even for a movie that's mainly for kids. There are many better ones in this category. The whole thing is like jiggling keys in front of the baby's face for two hours with no substance. Given all the above I still would like to end on a semi-positive note, that is I guess the 12-year-old me would have probably liked it 'cose back In the day I liked 'TMNT 3' and '3 ninjas'. So if you don't mind watching a whole lot of nothing or can skip some parts or do something else during the movie like going on your phone (I couldn't, had to sit through it) you may even enjoy some parts of it. Probably also helps if you haven't watched any other movies before. If that's a case give it a go. If not, probably watch or do something else. 'There are worse movies out there' however it's hardly the sentence you would want on the cover of your movie.", "It took time But it is worth for wait": "Reminded me of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Marvel comics is use to turning personal stories into epic events but for me that's strange for the movies.It does work better for the design of these Spider-Man movies, simple because spider-man is perfectly design for those personal stories. In this case it was one of the biggest crisis Peter Parker had to face when one of Spider-Man's biggest enemies J. Jonah Jameson (think about it) reveals to the world that he's spider-man. The event has Parker taking on personal issues that come with the reveal as Spider-man comes under criminal allocations (forcing him to need a lawyer (wink, wink), and his fame as the web swinging Avenger is divided, by those who love him and those who hate him. All this, not only messing up his life but the lives of those closet to him so he does a Marvel team up with Dr. Strange to change all that.", "Completely solid": "This is a solid 10 out of 10 film.

They display the cliches, allusions, and slang that the audience wants to see. Some producers consciously search fan sites to learn about the audience's attitude and expectations for the upcoming film. But frequently these specifics, intended to appeal to a broad audience, are episodic. Only with the new \"Spider-Man\" did they choose to base the entire movie on allusions and stamps.Even while the standards for the writing of superhero films are usually low, the tape starts to unravel at the level of history. Due to the absence of interpersonal issues, complex conversations, or philosophical undertones, nobody will be overly disturbed. The purpose of the major characters/villains, their suspenseful encounter, and the logic of the storyline, however, are all missing from Spider-Man: No Way Home. All characters from all conceivable worlds act improperly, and occasionally they even acknowledge it.The drama of earlier Spider-Man films produced by different companies and directors is the only thing tying the narrative together. The tape does nothing new for the established multiverse and instead parasitizes the labour of others. The majority of heroes and villains were \"rolled back\" by the designers, and they mainly used their intricately conflicting imagery in humor. The movie makes an attempt at seriousness in a few sequences, but this attempt is unsuccessful since neither the logic nor the overall tone of the movie supports it.The colorful sights and creative action make many of the year's dozens of foolish and naive blockbusters nevertheless attractive and enjoyable. However, Spider-Man: No Way Home also falls short in this regard. The majority of the movie is spoken in dull, garish, claustrophobic settings. They are occasionally broken up by silly, repetitious action scenes. Only two or three fascinating static shots will be typed for the entirety of the movie, but this is incredibly little for a tape with a running period of two and a half hours.Superheroes are a popular genre. And where the developers really fell short was in the attraction components. The surroundings are barren and worn. The soundtrack is only taken from previous movies (parasitism again). As was already said, bad action. The majority of actors do outstanding acting, but it gets lost in amongst these flaws. Although it is apparent that some actors did not try to put much effort into the visuals that bored them; rather, they were just acting for the number. Fan-fiction like Spider-Man: No Way Home is common. He is utterly ineffective and lousy, yet because of nostalgia, the audience is moved by him. One of the key characters in contemporary popular culture has a parasite on their body.And I'm writing this from the heart as a true fan of the series. I adore Spider-Man movies and like seeing them repeatedly. With the exception of one, I enjoyed every previous movie, regardless of the director or star. I can't adore Spider-Man: No Way Home because it is an inherently awful movie that I don't want to watch again.", "Sektor": "They did it! A Spider-Man trilogy finally stuck the landing! Spider-Man: No Way Home is an impressive culmination of the films that came before it, with an engaging storyline, exciting action, laugh out loud moments, and dramatic consequences.

I don't exactly know how this movie will hold up after multiple viewings, as there are some plot points that don't quite make sense when you start to think about them, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself this first time.", "Bloody Hell.": "I loved this film so much.

Let me say I'm a fan of spiderman, the MCU and can also enjoy the bad jokes they put into the movies. Desipte I'm a fan, I'm not that big fan I really search everything so didn't even saw a trailer from this one (it seems to help).So the first part of the movie is nice but more 'ok' then 'good', it's long and more building up to a why. Then the magic happens with the multiverse and damn you'll have to give credits on how they did it. I already like the 'comming home' title where the reference to spiderman in the MCU but the way they now connected the 'different' spiderman stories in this movie with the start of the multiverse is really genius. I can really appreciate on what they did and how to make the mulitverse 'easy to understand' by having same characters but different persons (and still how genius is it to use all different spiderman characters).When this came together and my mind was making the lines between it all it really became a very satisfaction moment for me. So well done! All the smaller things to imagine they brought together and how really great!So yeah if you'll can respect these kind of things you'll also appreciate this one.", "Delightfully Served Fan Service Despite Its Flaws": "Being probably the best Spider-Man movie, No Way Home's best strength is to touch fans' heart, get them excited and then exceed their expectations. Acting is superb especially by Tom Holland, who is able to deliver heart-wrenching scenes with great success.

As for being a superhero movie, I would calmly say that this is in the top 5, if not the top 2.", "Amazing movie!": "Went to the cinema not having watched any trailers or anything and thoroughly enjoyed this movie , if you can do not watch the trailers. Best marvel movie yet.", "Much better than the previous prequels": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is much better than its previous prequels. Bring back all of Spider-Mans (Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield) and their villains from another Spiderman universe such a great idea. Hopefully Tom Holland still want to play in the next sequels so more villains could come up; Kraven, Venom (Tom Hardy), Morbius (Jared Leto) and also The Sinister Six. Looking forward to see the next sequels.", "Good but not as good as the ratings say": "Maybe I higher expectations based on all the high reviews and hype of the movie. After watching myself, it was worth the time invested in watching a movie. It was better than giving it a 6 or lower so I stuck with a 7 rating. But the overall plot was flat beyond these things that get folks excited so easily.Pros:\nNostalgia factor was cool and characters, while not new, were intelligently brought into this filmMJ (Zendaya) seemed like a real and likeable person finally, better character development for her.Cons:\nNo growth for Peter - same dumb kid making the same dumb mistakesWhile the premise of the movie was to have a (supposedly) cool way to better introduce the Multiverse, this was not the best way as it doesn't really develop much more on that conceptDr. Strange can see 14 million versions of the future to find one to defeat Thanos, but can't see how catastrophic it was going to be to grant Peter's wish?More of a wish, but while the original trailer with Doc Oct was nice, would have been better if so much didn't leak out to have more of a surprise of the entries for this filmIt's not like there's a ton of cons, but they are kind of big for me. It would have been nice after two Avenger films, two franchise movies, and one Captain America appearance, that Peter learned SOMETHING about choices and consequences! But naw, still good kid making bad decisions. And again with Strange - the adult and Sorcerer Supreme (or ex SS) - couldn't take a couple minutes to mentor (AKA Tony Stark time) to explain the cosmos and cause and effect and how changing this event creates the butterfly effect and a new world of problems? Just would have like to have seen him try to prevent the very disaster that he knew could happen.The end result seems to maybe have finally produced a more mature Peter, but we'll have to wait and see in the next installment. It's still good enough to watch again, most of my complaints are more disappointment of making obvious bad choices (won't get into my feelings on Aunt May, end result speaks for itself) but maybe I'm just in the minority.", "\"No Way Home\" is a delightful treat for all Spider-man fans": "Synopsis: Peter Parker's life is a mess after Mysterio's dying words on camera \"expose\" him as Spider-man. On Peter's request, Dr. Strange casts a spell to help him out, but things go horribly wrong due to Peter's naivety. Now Peter has to deal with foes from alternate realities and also find a way to \"fix\" everything.Review: The much awaited conclusion to the MCU Spider-man trilogy is likely to be an emotional rollercoaster for fans - it would make them nostalgic, fascinated, shed tears of joy & pathos. Though the objective behind this \"multiverse\" film is fan service, it never feels as if the quality of filmmaking has been compromised to include the multiversal elements and Easter eggs. This is the biggest and most ambitious of all live-action Spider-man films; and Director Jon Watts has raised his own bar by giving this trilogy a rousing conclusion that conveys mystique, adventure, love, empathy, camaraderie, sacrifice & redemption. The background score by Michael Giacchino aptly captures the mood of every scene. All the actors are in fine form here, with the returning veterans stealing the show. It was a joy to see Alfred Molina's Doc Ock and Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin back, and the CGI aided facial de-aging worked wonders for their appearance. Returning as Electro V2, Jamie Foxx was much more impressive this time compared to his previous \"blue\" version. Benedict Cumberbatch's Dr. Strange was as charismatic as ever. Zendaya, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau, Jacob Batalon, JK Simmons and a couple of returning actors leave a mark in their respective roles. The other two villains - Sandman & Lizard, are in their 'non-human' form for 99% of their screentime so I can't comment on the actors playing them. Finally, Tom Holland holds his own amid a strong starcast and delivers a memorable performance as Peter Parker/Spider-man. The visuals and action set pieces are truly spectacular, and the epic third act alone is worth all the wait. The subsequent resolution is bittersweet, and fans would not want the film to end.A persistent issue with most MCU films (including the first two of this Spider-man trilogy), is the overtly jokey tone of the narrative. In this aspect, both Sam Raimi's and Mark Webb's Spider-man movies had a felicitious tone. Whereas in the MCU, characters act funny even in fatal situations thus making the whole act facetious. This time however, Jon Watts has used a more balanced tone. Yes, there are the usual jokes, banter and character references like a usual MCU film but here they were placed more appropriately. This is also Spider-man's most \"independent\" film in the trilogy yet, as there's no Ironman or Nick Fury to watch over him. There's only Dr. Strange, and he has been utilized more as a plot device than a superhero fighting alongside Spider-man.If I had any major grouse with this film it was this: An imminent face-off between Spider-man and a villain in the first act was abruptly \"cut\". Just as the action was about to begin with the baddie's badass entry, Spidey found himself somewhere else. Why tease the audience if you are not going to show the fight? This scene is also in the trailers, but there's nothing more to it in the movie which is such a shame.Irrespective of whether Jon Watts and Tom Holland come back for more Spider-man films, they should be proud of what they have done for the fans of this friendly neighborhood superhero.Verdict: I am happy to conclude that \"No Way Home\" is a delightful treat for all Spider-man fans. It ticks all the boxes for a film of its genre.Rating: 9/10.", "Pizza time": "Yall ready know what it ispizza timewords that rhymebatman laid an eggaunt may diedand happy criedand now he lost his bae.Ohhhspider manspider manspider all the wayoh what fun it is to ridein a 1 spider open sleigh.", "Kind of boring": "I'll compare this movie with a dish with a good, nice dinner in high priced restaurant. So why only 5 stars? Glad you asked: it is well written, directed, great actors. Everything is just right, maybe even perfectly crafted. But is it exciting? No. Unfortunately not. You can create a perfect meal - but it can still be boring. And at least for me that was this movie. It's just like some company dropped a number of ingredients to a Michelin chef and told him: make what you can. Meh...", "Best solo marvel movie. Period.": "This according to me is the best solo superhero movie marvel has ever produced because the on screen cast evokes so many emotions to the audience. At the end u are left with only one- a joy of fulfilment. This is entertainment at its best, a trip down nostalgic lane, a salute to superhero movies all rolled into one. Don't miss this cinematic spectacle in theatres. Thank me later.", "Just WOW ! GET YA ARSE TO THE CINEMA !": "Just WOW !What a wonderful film on so many levels this is what fun cinema is all about , As a fan of the Marvel universe this movie smashes into the top five with ease for me get to the cinema enjoy this the way it was meant to be see, My wife , 6year old son & I came out the cinema just smiling, loved this movie \ud83d\udd25", "You have to see it to believe it ..!": "At times, I watch movies for plot. Sometimes for action. Sometimes for thril and sometimes for acting. Very occasionally I watch movies just for the entertainment purpose. All earlier spiderman movies of Tom Holland were just entertainments. But this movie had everything. Decent plot, good action, good acting, great moments. I mean at first I thought there was this forced dialogue which seemed obvious but then bamm.. and It all makes sense. I won't tell what but Few things I would have loved to see play out differently.Overall, The movie is an eye pop candy and everything we fans asked for. Go for it ...you won't be disappointed. There are some scenes which are still playing in front of my eyes...Yes they were that awesome.", "Neglect the Naysayers, this Movie demands to be in Top 10.": "Some nit wits are saying that this Movie lack a proper storyline and Tobey & Dr. Strange didn't even wanted to be a part of it (as it was reflected in their performance). Meh. Now a days Every actor wants to be associated with Marvel in one way or another.Watched it today, and will definitely watch it again. It's one of a kind life action movie.Performances are excellent, for me Andrew & Goblin knocked it out of the park.They could have added more elements to it but I think they wanted to try this experiment out and wait for the outcome. I would definitely watch something like this again if they make another movie in this franchise. Well, box office numbers tells more than a review can. So wait and watch this movie break every record there is. Not pointing fingers but I believe other production houses will try to copy this idea.This Movie not only deserves but demands to be in top 10. Best of luck to the actors.Cheers!", "This is life": "Honestly, this is the best Tom Holland Spider-Man movie in my opinion. A lot of stuff happening throughout the movie that seems to outshine Tom Holland, but also a significant amount of things that will make you laugh, clap, cry, etc. The movie was brilliant and reminded me of when I saw Endgame with the Easter eggs, call backs, and with how the theater reacted. There's something for everyone, and it was truly a magnificent end of this first trilogy for Tom's Spider-Man. I'm excited to see where they take the next.", "I am speachless": "Just when you think they couldn't do better than Endgame, they do this. I laughed, I cried, I cheered like a kid. It was everything I wanted and everything I didn't think I needed. Thank you Marvel, thank universe for letting me live through this.", "Just two words worth watch on big screen": "I don't want to give any spoilers but just wanna say if you are 90's kid or 2000's you will love this. Lives up to all expectations of pre release hype. Trust me you wont be disappointed.", "A fantastic movie": "A mash up of all Spider-Man movies, very entertaining. Tom Hollands spider man from the MCU in this film is the main Spider-Man with spidermen from other multiverse' coming into the movie along with their enemies to due to a spell from Dr strange going wrong, the plan to return them all to their own multiverse is the main storyline in this movie. It is very entertaining and leaves you routing for Tom Hollands character in his bid to complete his task. A very well written. Chapter in the MCU spider man franchise, bringing all the characters from previous movies into the limelight once again, thoroughly enjoyed this movie. 9/10.", "Passionate, paced, unexpected": "Considering the latest trend in MCU, this movie came as a complete surprise. Although my expectations were low, I enjoyed watching it, specially watching Tobey Maguire back again on the role. I probably enjoyed it too much because of my low expectations though.", "Shocked - a film for Spiderman fans": "I'm still shaking with excitement, sadness and nostalgia, the film captures elements of every single Spiderman film , ever made, i watched, and wanted more, i'm desperate to see a sequel and i need to a a continuation story of the heroes, i hope the multiverse leads to a live action version of The Spiderverse, its now ripe to introduce Miles Morales and Spider-Gwen. Sony & Marvel truly delivered a film for Spiderman fans.", "It's good but not Endgame level": "This is probably the best Spider-Man movie. Loved it! The script at first is a bit sloppy but overall it's a good movie. Everyone's saying this is the best Marvel movie. I disagree. Spider-Man: No Way Home is not at the level of Endgame.", "Best Spiderman Movie Ever": "It's The First Live Action Movie With 3 Spidermans. Tom And Andrew Tobey Maguire Just Nailed It. William Steals The Show. Action Scenes And Emotional Scenes Are Best And That Time Of Scenes We Just Flow With That.", "A Thought Provoking Movie": "The movie has a lot of philosophical points. I'll explain some of them that were really obvious because if I get into everything the review will have the size of an essay. I'm not going to throw spoilers here. Anyways, Altruism is a misunderstood word because as people we do what we do to sometimes seem good no matter what if we are or not. Our world never needed a sacrifice or an idol but people who are willing to help our world for the best without caring about their reputation and their legacy. The fight between good and evil is classical but very important because the thought and the physical world doesn't exist without duality and the ending explains the whole purpose. So the prime of the movie meaning, between all the others, was how heroic and selfless/ anti - egotistical is to help people, save lives while remaining anonymous. I'm gonna leave to that because as I said before I don't want to spoil anything. It's definitely a must - watch.", "Not a bad film, but I feel so conflicted.": "On one hand, for the most part, I had a good time watching this. As an avid Spidey fan, seeing all three Spider-Men interact together is an absolute joy. And seeing Defoe as Goblin again (and the rest of the villains) is super cool and something I didn't expect to ever see again on the big screen. On top that that, Holland gives a great performance and he finally shakes off that Iron Boy Jr vibe by the end of the film and finally appears to mature into a Spider-MAN. It has a pretty darn great \"Spider-Man\" type of bitter-sweet ending.BUT... I got to say, the main reason why this movie is enjoyable at all is because of the fan service. There are a couple of really heartfelt moments in the film, like when Andrew's Spider-Man gets to redeem himself and save MJ or when Tobey's Spider-Man gets to remind Holland of \"With Great Power comes Great Responsibility.\" But sadly, for every emotionally great scene there are 10 more cheesy and inappropriately timed jokes and lengthy unimpressive CG sequences. There were no moments that made me die laughing, or made me cry, or made my jaw drop because of grand spectacle, or made me feel inspired because of a musical themes... It all just kind of felt like that basic new age Marvel to me... a bunch of inappropriately timed jokes, a rushed plot with characters that aren't given enough serious screen time without jokes to really care about, not a lot of resolution with the villains, and a ton of noticeable CG with not enough practical effects. It all just feels so shallow. Also, when they played off Harry's death from Spider-Man 3 off as a joke, I was a little pissed off, that's the MCU for you, take everything serious and turn it into a \"ha ha funny.\"Now, that being said, I did not hate this movie, not by a long shot. Like I said earlier, I loved seeing the three Spider-Men interact, it was so freakin fun and cool just watching them shoot the breeze. But cool fun fan service does not a great movie make. If you strip away the fan service, this movie is just OKAY. A film filled with brilliant actors but aren't given a proper script, direction, and theme to work with. And that's too bad because it had SO much potential to be better. If done properly this movie probably could have made me cry at least 5 times haha. We'll, good thing with my Spidey-Sense I preemptively took MJ's advice from the film, \"expect disappointed and you will never be disappointed.\"Now, I know that most Spider-Man fans will absolutely love this movie and aren't as critical of cinema as I am, so I can be happy for everyone else at least. I just wish it was a better over all film. Still a fun time though. Solid 6/10, a fine film. This review is gonna get a lot of hate won't it?", "Journey of a Lifetime": "Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man is back, full of Multiversal surprises.This movie is the third chapter in the MCU trilogy starring Tom Holland as the titular super hero, but also marks the stepping point for something entirely new in terms of cinematic experiences.The hype surrounding the project has been incredible over the last few months, to say the least, so I went to see it with gigantic expectations and I'm glad to see they were greatly exceeded.Jon Watts crafts a movie that honors Spider-Man as a character while exploring what he represents as a global icon and symbol for each generation. Tom Holland outdid himself as Peter Parker, giving him some more depth and personality. I particularly enjoyed his relationship with Zendaya as MJ and Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange, who magically (no pun intended!) stole the scene every time he appeared on screen.Marvel and Sony were able to pay homage to some old familiar faces, like Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin and Alfred Molina's Doc Ock, just to name a few. Their battles with Spidey were simply out of this world: both spectacular and breathtaking. Many viewers will be pleased to see the Wall-Crawler jump into action to save the day, while also evolving into something more complex and mature, like we've never seen before, with unexpected twists and turns.Universes collide in a story that manages to be a love letter to the amazing creation by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. It's an heartfelt celebration of Spider-Man. As someone who has been a fan of the character ever since I was a kid, I loved every second of it, from beginning to end. It has been quite an emotional journey and I'm glad I was able to be a part of it.Excelsior!", "Nearly Perfect": "What a masterful piece of filmmaking! No Way Home shines brightly in the world of the MCU, and manages to add enough genuine sorrowful ethos to balance out the triumphant joys. This movie is a true journey to things of the heart, and dares to ask (and answer) the question of why must good triumphing over evil leave such detritus in its wake? I have taken off two stars because 1:) the movie was just a scene or two too long and 2) the role played by the immensely talented J. K. Simmons should have been dropped from the movie altogether. But don't let any of this keep you home, the movie is a rollicking runaway train with terrific acting all around, with specific kudos to Marisa Tomei and Tom Holland. You can almost feel Holland's acting chops growing by the minute, and Tomei made the role of May hers forever. I left the theatre with the distressing question of what's next and how could they top this, hardly believing that they can possibly go any further, but I had the same question with nearly every movie in the Avengers Infinity saga only to be completely gobsmacked each and every time. Bring it on MCU! We'll be waiting!", "Spectacular!": "This movie was just amazing, with so many surprises and things you don't expect this movie delivers in every single way! While not flawless I don't care because I LOVED it and it was so fun to watch. I'd recommended it to everyone who loves Spider-Man and I can't wait to see what the future holds!", "Spider-Man : left with No Home": "I went to watch this movie twice since it has been released. I would give a spoiler-free as well as in detail review. (I would mention from where the spoiler-free review is ending)So let's get startedfirst let's talk about the spoiler-free review.The movie was like a parabola it went straight up and with the ending, it came down. There will be Doctor Strange as you see in the poster and trailers but since the movie is about spiderman he would not be in much focus. There is also going to be a surprise entry cameo of one great superhero which is, in fact, his first scene in Marvel Cinematic Universe you guys know him if you follow the comics, I am not going to disclose the name. This movie was excellent and left some of the most important unanswered questions also it opened the gate of many fan theories, of course as you have seen different villans from the previous spiderman movies (spiderman 2002, 2005 2007 and Amazing Spiderman 1 and 2) in the trailer, but I would suggest you should watch the movie Venom: Let there be carnage also before you go to watch no way home. This movie has a dark or you can say unhappy ending like the previous other spiderman movies (old ones). I am not going to tell why it is dark but you can think of the obvious.Now talking about the movie in detailSPOILERS AHEAD(please don't read the rest of the answer from this point if you have not watched the movie)In the first 5 minutes, the movie gave me a bang moment after seeing Matt Murdock ... I was like \"damn daredevil is in the house!!!\" though even just a cameo of 5 seconds now it is 100% sure that Daredevil characters would be joining the main marvel universe because we saw, Kingpin in Hawkeye's last episode (Main Villian of Daredevil). Now reunion of all three Spiderman was a shock for me because I don't follow social media buzz so much so, I was not expecting them to be here, plus Andrew Garfield continuously denied in interviews that he was in the movie. The reunion scene on the Statue of Liberty of one of the greatest scenes of the entire Marvel industry. The classic marvel humor scenes are also good like the scene where Ned's grandmother asks Andrew Garfield to clean the spider web. And the chemistry between Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield was amazing, like the scene where they were on the Statue of Liberty and Andrew helped him with his back pain.One thing that I did not like was Ned using Doctor Strange's magic ring and was able to perform magic so easily, the magic that doctor strange himself took so many years to learn. Aunt May's death was very emotional but this is the break through a point where Peter got that destiny line \"with great power comes great responsibility\" which would help him become the actual spiderman as it did with the two others, but still May didn't deserve to die. I don't know if you noticed it or not but the recreation of MJ falling from height and spiderman saving her was epic, that scene was breathtaking and it was Andrew Garfield who saved MJ and he got emotional thinking about the same incident where he was not able to save his MJ.In my view that was an outstanding scene. Now talking about the post-credit scene, Tom Hardy the venom character came and went back to his universe, he was able to gather intel about all the avenger's doings and past, so now he can be brought in the main storyline of marvel if they wish to do so. But when he was going you must have seen a little piece of venom was left behind, which was pure (as it was an offspring) and the only thing that it remembers is that he had to go and meet spiderman because Tom Hardy the venom said only this since he came to this universe, so maybe there is a possibility that the offspring of venom will combine with Tom Holland spiderman and he would become evil as we have seen in the old spiderman movie of Tobey Maguire. The second post-credit scene was the teaser of Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness that's a whole other topic I would write an answer about it if you want.I know I am missing out some great scenes because there are so many epic moments in this movie I can't mention them all, but this was the best Spiderman Movie that I ever witnessed.I hope you like my review, thank you for your time.", "What Were they Thinking": "The first 20 minutes of the movie were a senseless mess, and it got worse from there. Imagine a high-school student not only ignoring Dr Strange's directions but going 180 degrees against what Strange had said should be done. Because of his petulance, Peter Parker, managed to get his Aunt killed and by the end of the movie also managed to \"lose\" his best friend and his girlfriend. It seems that anytime a producer wants to stretch a story line they do it by invoking the \"multi verse\". I have seen every Marvel movie and this, by far. Was the worse one. I wonder what Stan Lee would think about what they have done to one of his major characters.", "MARVEL DID IT": "Don't check reviews, just go and watch this film. I can't believe they did it.What a movie. Nothing more to say, GO GO GO AND WATCH SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME TODAY.", "What a great movie!!": "Awesome, brilliant, woww what a great movie. Full entertainment. I felt so good I fell in love with this movie. I really enjoyed this movie. Graphics are too good and the story is mind blowing.", "Nostalgia props the movie up": "As an avid Marvel fan, this was the most excited I had been to see a Spider-man film since The Amazing Spider-man 2. The cinematography was beautiful, the nostalgia of seeing all the old villains gave me goosebumps and having all three Spider-men in one movie was incredible.The reason I give this one a 7 is that the nostalgia really made this film. The storyline itself was a bit weak, with Doctor Strange acting out of sorts and the writers using what have become old and tired items, such as Tom almost killing Green Goblin but being stopped because it's the \"right thing to do.\"As well, the spoilers that were leaked ahead of time really took away any surprises that could've happened, which is just unavoidable in the modern age of technology and smart phones.My last item I'd like to mention is I was really hoping for more of an epic entrance from Tobey and Andrew. While it was super exciting to hear the crowd scream when we saw them, I thought there could've been more epic and exciting ways to bring them into the movie.If you're looking for a nostalgic, well-produced Marvel film, this one is for you. But if you've heard all the spoilers and leaks, don't expect too much else. Still love you, Marvel!", "This is not a Movie": "THIS IS NOT A MOVIE,THIS IS AN EPIC!Goosebumps scenes:Severe\nIt will Fullfill your hype and expectation.The story is simple but the screenplay is just masterpiece\ud83d\udca5", "is it the best": "I watch spiderman no way home and i said after the i watched it, it was the best but after you think of it is it the best i will say no, is it bad? No i will say i liked spider man into the spider verse more worth watching.", "The whole cinema was clapping several times.": "When Andrew Garfield came through that portal everybody was so incredibly hyped and smiling. When Tobey Maguire came through the other portal, everybody was losing their minds. It was just such an amazing move. They had most of the important actors of the villains. Thank you!! OMG I wanna see it again. Legit one of the best Marvel films after Spider-Man 2 and the Iron Man Series.", "Good first half, Amazing second half (pun intended)": "The villains are great, and make a good first half with their interactions to each other and peter. When they show up ( you know who) the movie becomes the best thing marvel has ever done, and becomes a love letter to spider man fans, with each generation of spiderman getting each own moment to shine.", "Would be a 9.5 but you have to watch EVERY movie to know what is going on...": "This spider-man movie is by far the best. You have to watch and understand the Loki series in order to \"get it\". The cast does not exactly come out and tell you how all this is possible. So I'm guessing that there are a lot of negative reviews here because A) they don't understand what happened with the TVA or B) they took the spider-man character too seriously.Key points:\nThe spider-man character is forever a teenager, somehow. In order to love this fictional film, you have to get over the fact he still acts immature.Watch Loki and understand how this story-line is possible in the MCU.If you have not watched every marvel movie including the movies before \"phases 1, 2, 3 and 4\", you will not enjoy this movie as much as I did.Conclusion:\nI am giving this 8 out of 10 stars.Personally, I give this a 9.5!For everyone else, you have to watch and remember all marvel spider-man movies, all 3 phases of the MCU movies and the Loki series to truely appreciate this film. That is asking a lot...If you don't understand this movie, you will not understand or like the new dr strange movie coming out next month.IMO - watch family guy \"road to the multiverse\" if you like adult cartoons. This will probably help you understand what the word \"multiverse\" actually means with \"wicked\" new-england style humor. Or just google it on wikipedia...", "Nearly perfect": "Really great movie. Close to perfection. The site says that I need 150 characters so I hope this cuts it.Looks like it didn't. Maybe this? Really. OK... hmm. I'm glad that chose the late showing but now I'm really tired.", "Full packet superhero movie!": "Awesome awesome awwwweesomeee!Go and watch immediately!!!Full packet superhero movie. A good sense of humour, jokes, good action, goooddd enemies from the past films, good shooting. And very touching sad story. :(It is very very nice to see this movie like for an old spiderman fan. Some scenes really are touching. I cant tell you that cause it is spoiler. When u watch it you will understand.Dont leave the cinema until they kick you off from. 2 after credits are waiting for you.And try to not see spoilers on internet.Director Jon Watts made a good job, man.Congrats all the cast.And the other spiderman movies are on their ways.", "Great cameos just no real plot": "The movie was fun and the cameos were great.Overall I had fun, I just expected more. If we take out all the cameos their's not much left.Also the choices peter makes are kinda annoying. He's acting like a child.", "Loved every second of the movie": "This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman. I loved every second of it!", "One of greatest movies of all time": "Man I loved every second in the movie every 10 minute there a conclusion there a surprise I wished to be a great and it did and the end so emotional and set up to more powerful movies in the feature the movie so perfect that i felt it like symphony to mu eye's every one of the characters from tobey to andraw to the villeins to venom set up to miles morals set up to dr strange multiverse of madness set up every thing combined just perfect.", "Good always has consequences": "Fanservice and nostalgia are trends of the last decade. And Marvel Studio mastered them in the first rows, sometimes skillfully, and sometimes not really playing on fan feelings. Therefore, it is not very surprising that at some point the studio decided to play with the multiverse and, in particular, spidervers. In fact, this whole scenario trick that Marvel pulled off was created for just one thing - retcon. This is initially an overly drawn line with Stark and a bunch of free technologies from him. Peter's poverty is not a special one, a small number of everyday problems, a huge arch with Avengers for such a long-playing character at the beginning of the journey, and so on. All this, including the lack of a clear backstory, was literally rolled back to what the fans demanded - Peter's independence, his independence and isolation from the rest.", "To say this movie was amazing is an understatement.": "Got the opportunity to see this movie on the Thursday of release and was able to avoid any spoilers. What an experience, engaging film from start to finish, visual effects top notch, acting from all parts was just amazing. The nostalgia effect was amazing, the villains, the spideys, brought me right back to 2002 when my dad first showed me Spider-Man and was immediately hooked. Truly brought me to tears at least 7 times, cheering with the rest of the theatre with any of the big reveals was such a fun and amazing experience, thank you marvel and Sony for being able to pull off what you did and still keep so many secrets for the movie itself.", "Best Marvel and Spider-Man movie ever": "(Spoiler free)\nThis movie had some of the best Visual effects I have ever seen, amazing story, the acting was at its best, especially Tom Holland's. An amazing experience.", "Best Movie of the MCU and a good movie": "So where should i begin. For me the appearence of the other two Spidermen in this movie was totally expected, because this movie is a total handshake of Sony and Marvel Studios. And it would have been a complete owner of Marvel to not include them. But i did not expect so much screentime and that they would have such big roles. This movie contains 2 or 3 pictures that i will never forget and these pictures are on a Denis Villeneuve Level which is completely amazing. The scene were Peter Parker (Tom Holland) stands in the rain right in front of the screen where Jonah J. Jameson is baiting against Spidey. Lets talk about Willem Dafoe. Dear God he is soooo great as Green Goblin. I hope he will play Joker in the new Batman movies. This Green Goblin is more crazy and more brutal than the one in Spiderman. I know its the same but without this movie Green Goblin would just be a Power Ranger looking comic figure. The Green Goblin in Spiderman just scratches the surface of potential they got out of this character. He is more creepy and dangerous and dramatic (Norman Osborne in particular). Doc Ock is again not the evil guy but a man who just wants to male the world a little bit greater. And the bromance between the Spidermen is just beautiful. They have to learn to team up which is great. And then the scene were Toby tells Andrew he is Amazing. Pr the hug of all three Spidermen. Beautiful. I cant even stop. Theres so much to talk about. The Ending. But the thing that really annoyed me is Nate. He can do magic in a second. Steven Strange needed much much longer to learn this.

And since Covid-19 started, I was dreading not being able to see No way Home at the cinema because the fear of catching something in a crowded indoor space during a pandemic is very logical!But I did it with a late morning showing (so quiet, empty theatre \ud83d\ude0c) and boy am I pleased I did. I'm glad I wore a mask throughout the viewing otherwise they'd have heard me squeal from the next room.

Tom Holland gave the most believable and stunning performance of his career yet. The chemistry between Holland, Zendaya, and Balton's characters were all the experience you would expect from a superhero friendship between teenagers. Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange was, in my opinion, one of the weaker parts of the movies. The return of Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin/Norman Osborn was definitely the highlight of the movie with his split personality disorder between Norman and the Goblin. The death scene of Aunt May was the most touching and heart breaking scenes of any MCU movie. When Tobey and Andrew finally come back as they're versions of Spiderman, they give stellar performances and have great banter with Holland. In conclusion, Spider-man No Way Home is the greatest movie of all time.", "It's good but not great": "It was a good movie it kept me entertained, but the movie just try's to play on nostalgia more then actually telling a better story.

It's not easy task but Marvel did it again like they did in endgame ! To bring that amount of stars in a superhero movie !

It makes you laugh, cry, gasp & cheer whilst having much more depth and gravitas than I initially thought. The villains are great (some better than others) but Willem Dafoe's performance as Green Goblin steals the show and still sits with me now. This is hands down Tom Holland's best performance as Spider-Man/Peter Parker.My only gripe is the film tonally in the middle act, as it loses its way a tiny bit and some of the jokes feel unnecessary but the first & final act are a masterpiece.I can't wait to rewatch it.", "Total mess": "Oversaturated, overdone mess of characters.

PLEASE DO NOT READ IF YOURE WANTING THE FULL MOVIE EXPERIENCE TO FORM YOURE OWN OPINION:I left the theatre in tears, but not the happy kind. Understandably seeing the 3 main cinamatic spidermen I've grown up with along side the best bad guys from the many spiderman movies together brought alot of fan service and excitement in the scenes they shared. This excitement turned to anticipation and then quickly terned to disappointment when I realised this was the main pay-off of the movie. I was so sure there would be more but once I got past this i realised the movie was so full of poor pacing an ending that tries to be deep but back tracks on everything else we've seen from the MCU. Understand that the ending doesn't work not because spiderman got a poordeal but because it felt so out of touch with everything I've learnt through watching the MCU.Firstly I hated the \"just coz\" mentality of the science in this movie. Yes mavel does it all the time but never to this extent. The whooooole movie was \"just coz\" with no attempt at any kind of reasonable explanation to suspend belief. I dont accept that just because spiderman wanted to cure them all that there's some magic cure to a guy litarally made out of sand. I don't except that electro just magically came out looking like Jamie with a new personality and I should just run with it because the characters are also surprised (yes I understand that there was talk about the electricity working different, but come on, realy?). Why did lizard basically do nothing the whole movie? Doc ocs tech was so easily controlled remotely it makes me question why Peter never used this to an advantage outside of his costume, he seamed to know what he was doing straight away once it happened. Sandmans motives where pure garbage. He should know better that spiderman is a better choice to allign with than the others. He litarally had nothing to lose. He ether gets cured and goes back or he just goes back later. The other villains weren't even trying to get the box to go home which is exactly the opposite of what he wanted. Also why cant he look like a normal human like in the original movie. He's stuck looking like a pile of sand the whole movie, contradicting the original which left me confused when he did get cured at the end and he looked normal. Was it to not spoil the original actor comming back? Come on.I would also like to ask \"why isn't peter allowed a happy ending?\". I get that not every movie has to be happy and spiderman has had alot of sad endings through comic and movie history but it made no sence the way they did it in the context of the MCU. The way I understood it, because it was very much show dont tell (which I actually appreciated) Is because he wants to protect his loved ones he doesn't tell them who he really is. Sorry but Iron man managed just fine. IRON MAN, the guy Peter looked up to more than anyone and still references when he's feeling insecure or unsure of himself. Iron Man had a wife, a child and then chose to make the sacrifice for their and the worlds benefit. Iron man is litarally the poster boy for do what you want. His identity was litarally on public display and aside from the time he provoked a terrorist he lived a relatively normal life with his family, who again understood what it ment to be the family of Iron Man. I get that Peter is ment to be \"better\" than Iron man as quoted in homecoming but you can't show Iron man with his loving family and a daughter who now has a future (its tragic he's dead but his family goes on right?) and expect me not to wonder what made Tony different. It's not like it was pepper and his child that died. As far as I can tell their gonna be apart of the next phase of marvel. So again, why can't Peter be happy? PLENTY of superheroes in the MCU have friends shong chi is litarally bumbing around with his best friend the whole of the 10 rings movie and even brings her with him at the end. Again I've got no issues with the movie ending sad but it just felt un justified.The absolute biggest disappointment to me though, more than anything the movie did was the handling of the \"spoilers\". Marvel really can't handle that Toby and Andrew got spoiled months before the release of the movie and through interviews and statement it felt like we really hadn't seen everything and we could expect some surprises throughout the movie. Aside from Daredevil who I expected thanks to the Hawkeye show there was nothing that shocked me. I fully went into this movie expecting Toby and Andrew thanks to the trailers and leaks from months ago and in all honestly how could I not expect them when the classic Villains are back and Andrew Garfield couldn't keep a straight face in any interview. They also dangled the expectations of the sinister six in front of everyone. There was not a single person who wasn't excited for this. They showed 5 bad guys in the trailers which is weird if you'd wanna keep something a surprise so it was pretty much expected that the sixth Villains would be kept a secret buuuuuut nope. They dangled it and there were only 5 which they showed in the trailer. I felt like an idiot waiting for this last villain to just show up but it never happened. Marvel tried to subvert expectations but it only really works when what you get is somewhat comparable in the enjoyment of what was expected.I really expected more from the way this movie was promoted. There is litarally an interview with the three leads where they get asked \"people feel they've seen everything thanks to the trailers, what do you think?\" And they respond as if there's this amazing thing that they've kept secret and no one could possibly picture where they're going with this. But there wasn't. The trailers really did give everything away.What was up with venom? Was he just there to further fill seats. I remember watching the end credits to the carnage movie and getting so excited just to end up with a second after credit scene that looks like its heading the right direction just to have him go back to his reality and leve behind a bit of venom for someone other than Tom hardy to pick up and use. That just felt like the last slap in the face after just being disappointed. They hinted at alot more than what they deliverd and I think that was one of my biggest issue with this movie. If Andrew and Toby got spoilt just leave it at that and move on but dont start dodging questions and making us think there's more there when there isn't. But even then I cant say the story was anything great. Just characters not acting right and doing things to progress the story. Some strange pacing at times, not alot of witty dialogue from spideman considering that's kinda his main thing while in the suite and thus was made worse considering there was three of them. I can't say much for how doctor strange was acting as I dont know a huge amount about him but for sure that was a completely different character to the strange we've seen in the MCU and he's acting more like his old full of himself doctor Steven strange personality. Just outta nowhere to make the movie work I guess.Spite all I've said there were aspects of the movie I enjoyed. The interaction with the three spidermen was always gonna make me happy. It was great seeing how they reacted to one another and there dialogue out of costume was pretty good. I also think green goblin was nicely fleshed out with an amazing performance by Willem Dafoe, highlighting the split personality of Norman Osborne.Ill conclued with with some simple comments in list form:\n-May dying was a nice change of pace and I think that was a nice character moment which he needed to be able to relate to Andrew and Toby's spidermen.-Some of the quotes said by the villains to pay omage to their original performances was a nice touch of fan service (maybe overboard sometimes but I thought it was nice).-I liked that they gave Andrew some redemption-I really liked that they didn't just say everything that was happening. Like why Andrew was crying when he caught MJ from falling. Doesn't need to be explained, the fans understand.-The story leaves alot to be desired and the ending just felt like a way to set up for future movies but wasn't justified.-I felt like Marvel subverted expectations in the wrong way (who wants to see the sinister 5?, defeats the purpose of even having that many villains).-they gave away everything I the trailers. No surprise villains and even the people bot confirmed might as well have been.-I understand there are more spiderman movies comming out and most likely spiderman will get his happy ending eventually but after all the teasing, promotion and looking back on it now with hind sight, litarally everything had already been spoiled and Marvel tried to convince everyone there was more to see.Conclusion: It really did come down to how many people they could get in those seats. They presented a fan service film that deliverd on nostalgia but really not much else. Nostalgia, Andrew, Toby and the cast are the only reason I even rated this 2 stars. I just cant see this as a good movie purely based on nostalgia. Sorry Marvel.", "A cultural event that also talks about what it means to be Spider-Man (first half non-spoiler)": "I - NON-SPOILERThe first and most important distinction of No Way Home is that finally, Peter Parker being out as Spider-Man, he's reputation tarnished by Mysterio, and the way this clashes with Simmons' most prominent appearance as Jonah Jameson in a decade all give Spider-Man his ultimate foe: public opinion.It's Holland's best performance as Peter, it shows early on. Despite the multi-dimensional villains being the focus of attention in the trailers, the first hour dealing with the ramifications of the past movie is very captivating. It gives Holland room to digest where Parker's motivations really lie. He tries everything but the weight is too much, and the movie really beats him up before he goes to Dr. Strange. I'm in awe at how well Marvel scripts deal with the time they have. Contrary to many Hollywood flops, Endgame took the time to set itself up. No Way Home also stays true to storytelling principles that have existed forever, and fights the notion that blockbusters have no thought behind. It's one of the best set-ups in a Marvel movie.A shoutout to Zendaya who keeps justifying her massive growth in popularity lately, the camera loves her. She's a great actress and I've been rooting for her since Euphoria aired. She's committed, and my second favorite Spidey-girl behind Emma Stone.As for the rest, which I'll talk about a lot more vaguely, I'm gonna say that it is awesome. It really takes our main protagonist through the necessary steps he needs to go through to learn his lessons. As the film reaches its climax, Peter is not preparing himself for a fight, but instead trying to prevent it, and the way this clashes with the villains is something essential to the empathetic nature of the character.There is a lot to unpack and it does feel like a money-making move, but it is handled with a constant love for the character's values and that's what I'm all about, despite a few whatnots I will address in the second half. All you need to know if you haven't seen it is that if you go to a packed theatre with true fans, you will grasp the massive euphoria that the film is intending to generate (and succeeding).II - SPOILERSI thought the villains were all terrific. Jamie Foxx who got a chance to recover from him being a contender for the worst part in his movie. He seems calm and focused, essentially overwriting his character to seem cooler. Alfred Molina doesn't disappoint and seems to be fueled by anger a little more than he was in Spider-Man 2. His confusion leads him to use many tools of intimidation throughout, and I think this comes off very naturally. I disliked the part were he said his name and Peter and his friends laughed; not just because it's disrespectful to the character but because it's not funny at all, his name IS Otto Octavius, so what? I guess the fact that one of the worst moments was in one of the trailers speaks to the success of the movie.All of these villains seem to be slightly altered versions of the previous movies, which is nice because it sells even more the idea of the infinite multi-verse, or if anything it at least justifies it. Osborn, for instance, wins one of the best moments for me when he puts the Goblin hoodie over his head. This is a moment of aesthetic redemption, as his original suit went down as one of Raimi's most disrupting ideas, and even though I was never bothered by it, this other scene in No Way Home shows us what could have been and, in fact, what now is.The elephant in the room.I thought Andrew's entrance was a lot better than Tobey's. He actually seemed confused and interested by the freaking space-disrupting magic portal that appeared in front of him, whereas Tobey just looked like 'Hey y'all I'm in da house'. It just seemed a bit weird. That aside, most of what comes after is perfectly crafted and balanced. One of the key successes of the movie is how these alternate versions we all were expecting don't become the focus, but actually serve as the mentors of Tom (I'll now refer to them with the actor's names).A detour.I've been catching re-runs of I Love Lucy in the TV lately. To clue you in, the first three and a half seasons were about two couples living in New York, simple. However in the fourth season there's a shift and the characters started living in Los Angeles, and so the show for almost an entire season became a lot more Hollywood-driven, and given its popularity many guest-stars started to appear. Johny Wayne, William Holden, Harpo Marx, they would make the crowd crazy. Dead people who's fame is no more, back then would just say two phrases and the crowd would laugh cheer and clap. I see that as very charming and inoffensive and I like it, it makes me sigh 'Oh my how innocent we were back then'. But is it not the same now? When Daredevil appeared there was thunderous applause. People saw Doc Oc in the trailer and they still applauded loudly. To who? To themselves. For better or worst, Marvel has re-launched the communal experience of going to the movies, and for my money is the second most important crossover in the history of superhero movies (top one will always be the first Avengers), and it's not any different that what the comics did the past century, Marvel is just bringing it to the screen. You may see it as a negative but the truth is we haven't changed a bit, we are the same entertainment hungry population that wants to see familiar faces interact. This does not necessarily make anything good or bad. The Daredevil cameo is like an entree, to warm you up, you know. The fact that this cameo comes first gives you an idea of the magnitude that the movie is leaning towards.Now some negative aspects. Worst moment by far was the 'I'm something of a scientist myself' line-drop. It's completely shoe-horned and single-handedly could turn off anyone who's fed up with modern movies appealing to meme culture and is less forgiving than I am. Compare that to the scene where Tobey's back hurts and Andrew fixes it. This moment is a lot better in playing with the meme, because it does so to bring the characters closer, instead of stopping the movie abruptly to then awkwardly move on.Other than that I have to say they really measured themselves with the stupid Marvel humor that plagues some of their films. I'm from the Tobey generation, he's my favorite Spider-Man and that's what appeals to me, I still hold Spider-Man 2 and 3 as some of my favorite (solo) superhero movies. That's why I'm glad to say that he's written in a fantastic way. He's calm and plays the role of the wise old man in the trio, even if he's in his 40s or whatever. My favorite joke in the movie is when Ned asks him if he has any best friends (which I've been told has an even darker parallel than what meets the eye) and he traumatizes him with the story of Harry Osborn. Absolutely hilarious and poignant and true to his character, he's not making jokes, he's dead serious. Andrew is so very charming, I love it when he saves MJ and all his dorky comments, his natural charisma will probably live on after the multiverse implodes.The death of aunt May I'm still sort of torn on. It was totally necessary to the plot, I just thought that not even Marisa Tomei looked like she was convinced it was real, and the pacing kept it from being totally effective. There's a disconnect between her being fine enough to give a speech to Peter, and then suddenly get a massive pain and just poof out. But it does open itself to my second favorite moment in the movie, in which I cried a little. That's when the alternate Spider-Men see Tom from above and come down (very nice shot by the way, the crowd went wild). Tobey saying '...comes great responsibility' was a blood-pumping moment.My favorite moment of the movie was at the end, when Tom is punching Green Goblin in the face and he just keeps smiling like a maniac, which I thought was so messed up and so according to the character, followed by Tobey stopping Tom from killing him with his glider. The amount of emotion packed in that single stare makes for riveting self-discovery. It is a superb show-don't-tell, that threaded the needle of what this crossover gives to the character of Tom Holland's Peter Parker. That is why the nostalgia-factor doesn't bother me, because in the end the movie is absolutely certain of what it wants to do with it, and it is what I would want it to do.But then there's that fake kill of Tobey that signifies nothing. I thought that was a little cheap, a shock that didn't pay off. Thankfully most of the movie doesn't have these issues, most of the decisions are right on, and it's a pretty good margin considering how many questions I had about how they were gonna deal with the material. Even though the most hardcore fans would probably love the move even if it was bad, I'm glad to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. No Way Home is a smart, polished and frankly uplifting tactical partnership, that comes just at right time when we're freely able to explore the abilities of Dr. Strange in the Marvel Universe. And from a sociological view, it is also the message of hope and brotherhood we were yearning for after these past two years.It does feel like at points is trying to stretch the script to get the characters to do or say certain things because it will increase the chance of the fans having multiple nerdgasms, but it points at that goal by way of applause-worthy moments, subtle character interactions and a jam-packed yet totally understandable plot that takes Spider-Man to new territory and leaves him on a sad, lonely place, looking forward. It's the movie we all wanted, and will probably go down as one of the most significant amalgamations of our generation.

Unreal visual effects making this two hour thirty minute film fly in.

They used that spot for a preview.Sad.", "Mountain Brought Forth a Mouse": "Regarding \"surprise\" and special effects, one of the best cinematic experiences out there today, no doubt, especially fot those who have been following Marvel's iteration of Spider-Man since 2002.However, we got used to associate the charaters pertaining to \"The Avengers\" with a solid storyline behind, an almost perfect mix of accion, humour and drama, giving them an outstanding balance and cohesive personalities, with Marvel's incredible special effects studio putting the cherry on top.I don't mind that this whole movie happens due to a juvenile mistake, given the fact that spider-man is adolescent. What does bother me is that strong built characters like Dr. Strange went along with it, bringing forth dramatic consequences.I believe the most important thing about any good movie is a compeling and reasonable argument. On that matter, Marvel could have done a lot better and still maintain all the great features that, on scale, could have turned this movie \"great\" instead of just \"ok\".", "Best spiderman movie.

Full of emotions and lots of lots of surprises.", "Wish it was longer.": "This move had enough plot points and characters for a 3+ movie or a 2-part story. It's an absolutely fantastic movie but I feel like they kept it from reaching it's full potential by compacting such a large story into only 2 hours. My only other complaint is that I feel like the entrances could've had a little more pizzazz, maybe a meme-able moment or two. Also I really hope that Spiderman will return!", "A Ripoff with Very Awkward Writing": "TL;DR: It's Marvel's total ripoff of Into the Spiderverse and is chock full of really awkwardly paced acting while the entire movie teeters on a really weak premise. Marvel cares more about cheap fanservice than good writing.Do I really need to explain how this is a total ripoff of Into the Spiderverse? They literally just took the same concept and ran with it. Into the Spiderverse knew how to develop their characters and make you care about them, it had heart and soul. No Way Home lacks this.So much of the acting comes off as extremely awkward. No one seems to be themself. It feels as if everyone was acting in separate locations and not even on set together. Also much of the lighting is extremely weird too. There's a lot of shots that are straight up distracting with how obviously green screened it is. In previous Marvel films, it hasn't been too distracting, but it's pretty darn bad here.I'm pretty sure the directors had to meet a quota of at least one three-point-pose per fifteen minutes during this film, because Tom Holland has to strike that cliche superhero pose a dozen times throughout the film. Sure you could call it a nitpick, but it gets pretty tedious after the fifth time.The entire premise of the movie is really weak. I wont spoil anything, but even Dr. Strange has a line that through the fourth wall questions the entire premise of the movie. It's really contrived, and ends up being a universe-threatening situation which just makes it feel too big for a couple of teenagers to figure out. (In other words, in universe, it doesn't make sense why no other Avengers or characters in the franchise don't get involved, thus breaking suspension of disbelief).There's also a ton of half-baked code switching from several main characters. I get that they were trying to do the subversion of \"Character wants the thing, but when they're about to get the thing they get cold feet and don't want it anymore.\" But the writing is so poor it just comes off as \"I changed my mind because the script told me so,\" rather than actually making you believe the character had a change of heart.In typical Marvel fashion, it's just an excuse to get a bunch of fan-favorite characters to hang out with each other, and literally wave a magic wand at the end to make the problems all reset themselves.", "Boy, did they deliver.": "No other words than, \"absolutely incredible\". The emotion, the suspense, the excitement and nostalgia! I was so astounded at how they made this whole thing work with the previous actors. They didn't just come back for the part, they came back to glorify and solidify their mark with such incredible performances. I was the MOST impressed with Willem Dafoe. Man was that a performance! The ending brought me to tears, and was a perfect close to Tom Hollands Spider-Man. Bravo.", "Where is Toby?": "M\u00f8kk! Where is Toby Maguire?This gets so stupid that it hurts.

If you are marvel fan just go and watch, however, if you just want to watch an action, hero movie please just read carefully what I wrote.BAD WAYSThe most important problem is that this movie has been made for just quelling fans desire (especially after the movie of spider-verse). Because of this situation, there are a lot of heros who have no relation with the movie. To give an example, electro, sandman, lizzard have no story, no improvement of their character, even their SGI was not perfect unfortunately.Second problem is that the story of movie is improving guickly you can not understand where Peter Parker learn his emotions, reactions etc. And also relation between Strange and Peter Parker could not be shown well.There are also some technical issues, but I can not explain withiout spoilers and also these are not important when you watch the movie you will realize them.GOOD WAYSPeter Parker has learnt that he has a big power with the big reponsibility his story almost completed with the 3 good movie, especially while the biggest problem of all spiderman movies was the story of Peter Parker, Peter Parker is now the person who can take charge.Second positive way of the movie was that it had perfect and storng characters that can affect the way of movie suddenly and for most of them Marvel used succesfully.Without spoiler thats it guys \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffb", "Over long, action heavy ending": "There's a current trend to cram as much action as possible at the end of a movie.

I went to the cinema with high expectation and marvel improved that, giving me times when I couldn't even breath because of the action on it.", "This Proves That Tobey Maguire Was The Most Loved Spidey": "When did Tom Holland become 'Spiderman fused with mobile device'? In the last Spidey movies a mobile phone has been used in practically every scene to forge a heroic alliance between filmgoer and movie. We all have devices soooo...let's give them what they want - said the Producers. Plot? Nah not so important.This movie is basically Peter Parker making totally rash decisions leading to close personal tragedy and death. But he is the hero???Let's face it, Tom is the weakest after Andrew and King Tobey. We all went to see Toby Maguire in this one and when he made his triumphant appearance the theatre erupted. Then he was completely underused! Whilst Tom fell into a self indulgent fetal position due to bad decisions everyone around him was left to watch and tag along.This confused movie only demonstrates that Tobey Maguire's era was the most loved, well regarded and missed (don't mention Spidey III).", "You really aren't allowed to hate it.": "How the casting is from beyond my understanding, though I know it's incredible to see all these people together. But there is so many other things that plays into this movie. Like... If the meme with IGN saying \"This makes you feel like spiderman\" was said here... It's really close to the truth. This is the most Spiderman movie you can get!I remember I just had to recover from this movie... That might be extreme, but i didn't know which words to put into it right after watching it. They somehow make you feel like you can't hate anything about it. You can try, but with all this movie is, it's really hard finding excuses!How the story develops is remarkable, the money shots, the comedy, the action... When you watch this in theaters it's such a unique experience because people are cheering and clapping more than I have ever seen! I am glad I went in and saw it before cinema closed because of covid, but if you still have a chance to watch, go watch it now! You will not experience this form of entertainment in cinema in a long time!", "Pure fun.": "Not going to say much, but I believe I just watched the perfect Marvel film. It brought the feel goods to me for multiple reasons. Brilliant plot, excellent acting, and great twists.", "Marvel on top of their game": "In my book, Spider-Man: No Way Home takes the lead as the absolute best Spider-Man movie so far. Stunning actor performances all around and a script that manages to tie together parts from the entire Spidy-franchise at a level that rivals that of the infinity wars movies.Do yourself a favor and stay away from spoilers as much as you can. But even if you have read or heard about some of the many treats this movie has in stock for you, it is absolutely worth watching ever minute of it.A true masterpiece.", "This seemed like the dumbest movie yet...": "Exactly what happens when the dead people get sent back to their universe? How come the great sorcerer is so foolish as to be 'managed by an 18 year old?

With that being said, this movie was incredible! I will NOT give away any spoilers, since this movie has only been out for 11 days, but this movie will be a godforsaken treat to any diehard Spider-Man fan. This movie will make you laugh, grow anxious, cry, and the whole fiasco. I can safely say that this is the Spider-Man I have been wanting to see since Homecoming. It's not as good as Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2, but it is very close to being just as good! 9.5/10!", "The Greatest Spider-Man Movie Ever!": "No Way Home not only met the expectations but actually exceeded them. The Storytelling for this movie is so strong the people are at edges of their seats. The performances of evey actor is good but particularly Tom Holland's and William Dafoe's are the best. I wonder how they managed to pull off comedy in such an gripping film! Seriously Kevin Feige know exactly what a marvel fan wants!", "Lived upto the hype": "It was not just a movie it was a treat to all the spiderman fans. Great movie, great action. Lives up to all the hype it created. From start to finish there was not a moment to keep my eyes off the screen.", "wait for the worth": "They did it! A Spider-Man trilogy finally stuck the landing! Spider-Man: No Way Home is an impressive culmination of the films that came before it, with an engaging storyline, exciting action, laugh out loud moments, and dramatic consequences. The beginning climb is a little slow, but it's an exhilarating ride once things get swinging. I don't exactly know how this movie will hold up after multiple viewings, as there are some plot points that don't quite make sense when you start to think about them, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself this first time.", "NGL a big messy joke": "Wow, just how much I'm disappointed with how lame every phenomenal character have been reintroduced. The great idea of the multi-verse have been wasted down to ashes due to lame lame script, dead jokes, nonsense regarding to peter actions and not fitting visuals for this big movie. I feel pity for my poor soul who desperately tried to enjoy the film. I gave this movie 6 just for the great cast.(I can't believe they did better in the previous movie)", "A great nostalgia trip and a great ending for Tom Holland Trilogy": "I grew up with Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield film and i always enjoy them more than Tom Holland spidey movies, but this time its different, this movie makes the returning character more interesting by giving them more screen time and a better motives especially for Lizard and Electro, Tom Holland also give an amazing performance, his acting here is better than his previous spider man movie and if y'all hate Iron Man and his influence in the first two movie, this movie rarely have any influence about him other than the fact that his tech is used by some villain.Willem Dafoe absolutely stole the show with him returning as Green Goblin, he's more menacing and the movie deserve a praise for not toning him down or making a lame joke about him.And last but not least, y'all are hyped for Tobey and Andrew return right? Let me tell ya something, they're in the movie and they have a 25-30 minute screen time, the interaction and chemistry between the three Spider-Men are absolutely incredible and funny, the movie honour Tobey and Andrew legacy and their appearance makes Tom Holland Spider-Man matured, all of three have the same proportion of spotlight so all Spider-Men are treated equally, the CGI being more advanced now showcase Tobey's skill as Spider-Man better.", "Amazing!!!!": "This is the greatest movie of all time I loved\nevery second of it and this movie exceeded\nmy expectations I would watch again and again. The movie has a lot of shocking things in it and you need to try and avoid spoilers. I can't wait to watch it again.", "BEST MARVEL MOVIE....

If you are a Marvel fan; this movie will BLOW YOUR MIND!", "The most overrated movie": "Watched the movie twice, the first time I was fascinated because many heroes appeared from the previous films, but when I saw it the second time, I found that it was a movie with no drama or scenario, that it lost high production and photography and some stars, there are many superhero movies better than it, For example, the movie The Dark Knight,And the production company knows this well but they just want the money, it doesn't matter the quality of the movie.", "Best Spider-Man film": "This is the best Spider-Man film, everything about this movie is great, the pace, the music, the cgi, this is so awesome and it feels so nostalgic seeing this film. Great film!!", "MUCH EHPIC": "Much ehpic. Seeing spooderman on screen was much fun for my 10 year old sun. Wuld defoonetely recommend. I really luved it when I saw spooderman on screeeeeen. If u like spoodermonkey you shuld watch. El em aye oh ex dee.", "Don't let the fan-service make you blind (or deaf)": "Alright, I will join the familiar \"I don't usually write reviews on IMDb but I am gonna make an exception for this one\" club. I sincerely wanted to love this movie, just as any other movie I've watched and I will ever watch. Why? Because leaving the theater disappointed is one of the most unpleasant feelings a film lover could ever experience. It's like being deprived of something you felt was rightfully yours. Anyway...Back to the movie: does it contain everything everyone was expecting from it? Yes. The second half is basically a giant meme composed of all the \"imagine if they did this scene where the three spideys talk about X\" type of comments I have read over and over under the \"No Way Home\" trailers. Is this a problem for me? No, not per se. But it becomes one if this sort of exaggerated fan-service distracts the viewers from the main issue regarding this movie, that is: it is extremely childish. To the point where it becomes unrealistic and, therefore, poorly written. Leaving aside the cringey jokes (that make up a consistent part of the movie, by the way), the entire first half is driven by nonsensical choices made by all the characters, both young and adult ones. And to all you out there arguing that the movie mostly deals with adolescents, keep in mind that there's a huge difference between high school and kindergarten. I won't go into the details of all the problems I have with this movie's screenplay: if you've seen the movie and you're not delusional you'll know what I'm talking about.With Peter and Green Goblin's first fight, the movie takes a completely different turn, instantly becoming darker and more serious, and also way more enjoyable. Don't get me wrong, dialogues are still overall amateurish and predictable, but there are way more fight scenes, meaning that the characters don't talk that much. And that's a blessing, because the silent moments are the ones that prevent me from giving this movie an even lower rating: Aunt May's passing is painfully touching and Peter and MJ's encounter after Doctor strange's spell is magical in its drama.To sum things up, this movie really left me thinking about some of the latest Marvel movies' inherent problems:1) Are all Marvel movies destined to have the same tone, regardless of the plot?2) Is the quality of the Marvel movies only determined by the degree to which they satisfy the viewer's expectations, regardless of more technical issues, like screenplay, cinematography and such?To quote this (and the first Spider-Man movie): \"with great power comes great responsibility\". Well, the greatest power of all is intelligence and it should never be forgotten when it comes to writing movies.", "Uh.... What a ride!!": "After watching this movie............. This was beautiful MCU movie i ever seen. I loved every second from this movie all what i was expecting is kinda became true absolute blasting movie!", "The best movie of all time!!": "Andrew and tom and tobey in one movie is so incredible!!The actors played very very very good there roles!!It's so beautifull to seee all these actors play again there roles!!Just amazing!!But the ending is frustrating.", "Went with high expectations, left with these all (more than) met": "Went with high expectations, left with these all (more than) metI haven't been looking forward to watch a movie since Endgame, where then I left the theater with a bit of disappointment feeling even if it was a great movie.Usually when you are looking forward for something it turns out a bit less than if you weren't expecting anything. So I was kind of nervous to go to the movie, even more because of all the trailers and (online) gossip around this movie.When the movie was finished, while waiting for the post credit scene, I was sitting with a huge smile. The movie combines a lot of elements from the MCU, with just enough humor, and with the usual stunning action and CG scenes.All my credits go to the team (and more specifically the writers) of the movie, putting together such a high quality movie (and story) and not falling after the climax that Endgame was.The movie might be a little bit too long for younger children, but I highly recommend this movie to anyone, even not MCU followers.", "Wonderful": "After watching Peter Parker go through high school, fight monsters and being bliped for 5 years it's great to see how Tom Hollands Spider-Man tries to still always safe everyone. This is a hopefully new Beginning to another era as mich as it is an end to one as well.", "Amazing for the fan service, not so much for the film making": "A pretty good ending of the trilogy. Spider-Man: No Way Home is in no way an amazing movie but does have aspects to it. Initially, after watching this film, I think everyone was just amazed by what they had witnessed and were over-joyed by what Marvel had given them. However, this movie is a messy mix of okay storytelling and fan service. Jon Watts definitely improved on his former movies with this film, but it was not a great film as it's made out to be.This film begins with an entertaining sequence in which Peter and MJ are swinging around New York to get away from the angry population which accuse Peter of killing Mysterio. However, this sequence slowly builds into a boring first 30 minutes of the story with the only thing to keep you entertained being the appearance of Charlie Cox's, Matt Murdock. This is a really cheap way to keep the audience entertained while watching. I'm not going to lie, I loved this movie when it came out for these reasons however now I looks back, fan service doesn't make a movie.After these first 30 minutes you finally get introduced to the first 'villain' of the film being Dr Octavius. This fight scene in particular is just fine, not a standout though. It was also over fairly quick with nothing really entertaining about it. My favourite fight of the film was at Happy Hogan's apartment. It was very entertaining with great choreography and some really interesting elements. They added emotion in this scene incredibly with Aunt May's death which created a really interesting dynamic for such an innocent Peter Parker to follow.After this scene we get the fan service we were all waiting for which was Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield making an appearance. It was also very entertaining to watch all 3 of the Spider-Men work and fight together but the final fight felt a bit too rushed in how it did things until Peter was fighting the Green Goblin. This very final fist fight between them was very well done, it carried the emotion well and led into a good ending to the film.Overall, I think Jon Watts created the best film of the trilogy here but there was a lot that could've been improved. Extremely Entertaining to watch but just filled with fan service and no real developed plot.", "Peak Marvel!": "Honestly haven't been this excited for a movie in a long time. Was jumping in my seat quite a lot throughout the film. This is a true love letter to Marvel fans but more specifically Spider-Man fans. The idea of Andrew and Tobey even returning was such an amazing thing to imagine, but seeing it on the big screen was truly incredible. The chemistry between Tom, Andrew and Tobey is on point and really feels \"real\" in a sense. For me personally, Andrew really steals the show which really feels like they gave him a redemption after being let down by the writers in his own movies. Having old villains return for one final showdown is just golden. Willem DaFoe puts on an incredible performance alongside Alfred Molina. Personally Jamie Foxx was my favourite out of the bunch, he really stood out among his fellow cast. Can't wait for Tom's next trilogy and what it might hold. If you had suggested this concept a few years back people would've thought you were crazy. But thankfully Marvel made a dream, become reality!", "I could nitpick but I won't. My heart is too full.": "I'm not gonna spoil anything or dissect the plot like I would with probably any other Marvel movie. Like ignoring the calories in a Baconator, sometimes you just have to let yourself enjoy it. It's good for the soul. I'm satisfied.", "2 Hours and 20 min - could have been 90 minutes.": "I have never been so bored watching a Marvel movie before.Plot holes everywhere.Long drawn out un-emotional, acting scenes. One went on for 45 minutes.....\nDisney is systematically, killing off Marvel.", "Something new, something old.": "This movie is redemption for the producers of the Spider-Man movies that have been left unfinished for years.It's priceless to see Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield acting the role of Spider-Man again, especially Tobey is legend. I grew up with his Spider-Man movies.It's not perfect for a movie but no other movie feels like this for me. Thanks for Spider-verse, i hope we will see again something new, something old.", "Without spoiling anything, I couldn't really ask more.": "Going to the cinema already being spoiled about some details, but it just put up my hype even higher, and the movie still blowed me away. The feeling rollercoaster, the fan service was used really delicately, without exsagerate. They gave us everything, literally everything we've ever asked for, and even more. All the characters are those that we've already known their stories, so no world building, no character introducing, they had all the movie time to develope the plot, and they did it well. Have to say it was one of my most satisfied experiences in the cinema these years. A movie for every marvel fan, every Spiderman fan and even more!", "ONE OF THE BEST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE": "For the first time in my life , I have gone to a movie without any spoilers , even deleted my social media apps.And I gotta say I have enjoyed a lot.This movie was soo good that each and every moment felt special.And I don't know why, but my hands came together automatically and I was clapping for the whole movie.This is what it means to be a true spiderman fan.NWH is just epic .Thos movie is a must watch for the movie lovers, not only superhero fans.I gotta say Dr. Strange rocked.A must watch movie.", "Ha": "Best film ever.

How do you downvote a movie with so amazing actors?But the movie is very sad. It is a movie about Spiderman leaving the MCU and descending into the shabbiness of Sony movies. Aunt May dies, everybody else forgets about him and even loses ties to the Avengers, so he has to do his own suits. The movie happens when high school is over, so no need to come back to school. Full reboot. Nobody knows Peter Parker now. Spiderman is back in a self-made lycra pyjamas.It is not a movie. It is a Spidy-cameo special, where old figures walk our hero out of the MCU back to Sony.", "Wonderful , Amazing, fantastic": "This film has everything that a fan loves, It is drama, action , fantasy, comedy and everything you enjoy it. The best film I have ever seen from Marvel Studios\nTom Holland is one of the best actor in the Hollywood currently and he is the best actor in the movie.I recommend you to see this film specially on cinema.", "No spoilers-honest-Onhyped-review": "I was a fan of the comics and even the cartoons growing up. My favorite Spider-Man movies are: Spider-Man by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.Here's another Spider-Man movie featuring Peter Parker (Tom Holland) and his useless friends battling some absolutely dumb immature narcissistic villains. (Seriously they aren't that smart) The entire film is very childish and the acting was mediocre at best. Some of the action scenes featured the same cliche locations such as a bridge full of cars, the Statue of Liberty and - a scaffolding fight scene (wonder where I've just seen that oh yeah Shan-Chi) And Benedict Cumberbatch... looked like he had the time of his life. No, he didn't. He looked bored out of his mind. There were some interesting fun nostalgic moments - but even those could have been done so much better. I was laughing occasionally, and the fans' reactions and cheering in the cinema still made everything worth while. Overall the movie offered - mediocre story, boring acting with some obvious CGI work. It'll be the last film I'll see in a while before another lockdown in our country. C'eat la vie.", "More then endgame": "Awesome. Watched it yesterday and I still cannot wrap my head around how good the movie was. The references and the acting and the nostalgia \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d it was soo good. I would do anything to watch it again for the first time.

It's everything I could have asked for and more.", "Pandemonium for nothing": "When Marvel is doing everything it can to sell, as well as with an ending that makes the audience feel fooled and deceived. For a cinema fan who loves the real art of cinema, the film was extremely bad and undeniable.", "With great powers comes a great movie": "This movie rounds out a cinematic cosmos which you din't know is a cosmos at all.No way home is Endgame to the Spiderverse. And that being sad, it didn't have a build up like Endgame.It is true to the characters, it is heartbreaking, it is evil, it is the best popcorn movie of 2021.", "The best Spiderman film of all time.": "I understand for lot of people there might be many other films that are the greatest cause it's a person to person opinion so I will give a review which is pretty biased although It is hard without spoiling the film but I can do it it's a must watch film cause the story telling is amazing the movie hits a lot emotional level the ending is very satisfying the cgi is beyond amazing the villians have outdone them selves they were all good in there previous films but in this one they absolutely took on thier roles on another level you are missing big if you don't experience it it's all you can ask for a Spiderman movies there is amazing web slinging humour crazy interactions and Tom holland acting is on another level I really want to thank the cast crew director script writter for giving us such an amazing treat love u guys ton have. Great day watch Spiderman and let's make it the no.1 movie .", "Better than endgame? Possibly.": "This movie was awesome. I mean, how could it not be? What they did with Andrew Garfield really made this movie what it is. Do we even have to talk about our childhood hero Toby McGuire?", "Everything I hoped it would be": "Wow, where do I begin.Ever since the news first broke of Molina and Foxx's inclusion (and Tobey and Andrew's possible inclusion) in this film almost 14 months ago, much like Otto's fusion reaction, my excitement grew exponentially. I had never, ever been this excited for anything in my life- and I won't be this excited for anything ever again.So there I was on opening night, sitting in the front row of a sold out Screen 1 inside the world famous Odeon Leicester Square cinema, with 800 people cheering and clapping as the lights dimmed. But would this film, something I've thought about and longed for over a year, live up to the hype?Yes.Right off the bat, I'll say this- I am not the biggest fan of Tom Holland's Spider-Man. He is shackled in the MCU, where every story has to be connected and every plot thread has to ultimately lead to Tony Stark. He was too reliant on Tony Stark and his technology in the first 2 films, and his portrayal of Spider-Man suffers because of it. Spider-Man is supposed to have a homemade costume, not a multi-million pound suit with enough gadgets to make Inspector Gadget turn his head. My other gripe with Holland's Spider-Man is that he never faces the hardships Peter Parker should face. We haven't seen him lose anyone significant (no, I'm not counting Tony Stark) or go through personal troubles like the ones Sam Raimi brilliantly imposed on his Peter Parker. But thankfully, this film fixes a lot of those issues.I truly believe that *this* is the film where Tom Holland's Peter Parker truly becomes Spider-Man. He feels loss and makes true sacrifices that various iterations of Peter Parker have felt and made for the previous 60 years. May's death is tragic and his sacrifice of his relationship with MJ is exactly what Spider-Man would do. He becomes a Spider-Man free of any external help; no billionaires looking over his shoulder or no fancy state of the art suits to swing around in. By the end of the film it's just him, his dingy apartment and a homemade suit that pays homage to the suits of 60's and 70's Peter Parker. And that excites me for the next film.Seeing a rouges gallery from the Raimi and Webb films- Molina's Doc Ock, Foxx's Electro, Ifans' Lizard, Haden Church's Sandman and Dafoe's Goblin- who was especially incredible in this film- was exhilarating. It was indescribable watching these iconic villains go toe to toe with Spider-Man again.The main factor I was so excited for this film was the return of Tobey Maguire. I grew up with the Raimi films and the original trilogy was my childhood. Seeing the greatest Spider-Man to have ever graced the screen have one final outing as the web slinger again felt unreal. Watching my childhood hero don the gorgeous Raimi suit and swing through the air again made me do something I have never done before watching a film- cry. And I mean full-on bawling. Seeing him talk to Otto again with Elfman's brilliant score in the background gave me pure joy. And with Andrew there too? It was surreal. Seeing all 3 Spider-Men swing and fight together had my jaw on the floor, my heart racing and tears in my eyes.Is this film the best Spider-Man film ever made? No- nothing will top the masterpiece that is Spider-Man 2. But it is still a heart-pounding, nostalgic and incredible film that is leaps and bounds ahead of any of the previous 2 MCU Spidey flicks.I don't believe I'll ever experience a film like this again. It was everything I wanted it to be, everything I hoped it would be. An experience I will remember for the rest of my life.", "Only some millenials can appreciate this movie": "Anybody else who really grew up with Spider-Man in the 60s, 70s or even 80s would give a 2 to this movie.In fact, the end result shouldn't really be surprising when seeing what Disney did with Star wars.", "I HAVE NO WORDS !": "Man this was something else. It's literally once in a lifetime since Avengers : Endgame. Thanks for this awesome trilogy. Tom Holland totally nailed it. This is the Peter Parker of our generation. Can't wait for another awesome trilogy !", "Fun, but struck with a problem...": "Without delving into spoilers- the film is fun, especially if you've seen previous romps by Spiderman on film (I wore out a VHS of the Sam Raimi film as a child).Whilst fun, the film has a problem of not developing anything for long enough to feel there is significant risk to anyone. Everything that occurs is very rushed, which the film keeps pace with, but doesn't change the fact its all a bit too fast.Ideally, this could've been two movies which would give enough time for stakes to build and for each plot point to have some weight to it. Instead, the film spends maybe 5 minutes on a threat before either resolving it or moving onto another.This leaves the scenes that are supposed to have impact feeling very shallow, and more often than not - a joke.The film does leave a very interesting future for Spiderman though, and at that point I have to give it props.", "Spidy": "Just awesome!Best ever spiderman movie\nBest Marvel's movie after Endgame\nMust watch\nJust awesome!Best ever spiderman movie\nBest Marvel's movie after Endgame\nMust watch\nJust awesome!Best ever spiderman movie\nBest Marvel's movie after Endgame\nMust watch\nJust awesome!Best ever spiderman movie\nBest Marvel's movie after Endgame\nMust watch\nJust awesome!Best ever spiderman movie\nBest Marvel's movie after Endgame\nMust watch\nJust awesome!Best ever spiderman movie\nBest Marvel's movie after Endgame\nMust watch\nJust awesome!Best ever spiderman movie\nBest Marvel's movie after Endgame\nMust watch\nJust awesome!Best ever spiderman movie\nBest Marvel's movie after Endgame\nMust watch.", "Perfect spider Man movie": "I think it's an amazing things to see three spider men in same movie.

Every minute was just amazing. A total cliffhanger! It is also the most emotional spiderman movie of all time. It sapped me into the old spiderman vibes. I didn't connect to Tom Holland much but now I do. The movie went full circle and gave justice to all the previous franchises. I thought I won't be able to connect to Tom Holland and was having second thoughts before going. But the movie from start to finish was so awesome. Definitely one of the masterpieces of Marvel along with Infinity war and Endgame. Flawless!", "An epic, daring and thrilling adventure": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is the greatest superhero movie I've ever had the pleasure of watching. The film delivers everything we could hope for and not expect from the movie. An adventure that takes on unimaginable proportions for the friend of the neighborhood.

The comic tone is present throughout the film and the funny moments are very well positioned between the lines of the script. I want to see it again!", "Breathtakingly Amazing": "One word to describe this movie is Amazing. The fight scenes, cast, storyline and visuals were all exceptional.

I can't decide how much should i give you with any spoilers, so I'm not gonna discuss what you gonna get in this one all i can say is it's worth every single penny you gonna spend if you gonna watch in theatre, we all became fan of Spiderman as children \"no way home\" is the kind of movie when you gonna shout like that same kid one more time.", "What in the flying f..?": "Honestly. What the hell happened to the MCU?The first 10 minutes of the movie can cause an epileptic seizure; everything unfolds so rapidly that by the time something serious takes place you're left hopeless trying to comprehend what took place during the last minute.Loads of unnecessary fan-pleasing cameos that contribute nothing to the script. Full of overused lines and references from other hit marvel movies. The whole film is what a Redditor would come up with if they were left responsible for the script.Don't get me started with the \"humour\". More than half of the movie is full of fart jokes and braindead jokes for the average normie. The constant joking is ridiculous and makes compassion for the characters non existent. How am I supposed to feel bad when someone dies when 2 minutes ago they were laughing??? The ending is really deep and serious, but one just can't feel bad when the rest of the movie is one big joke.Overall fun movie. DO NOT expect to watch a serious super hero movie. Nothing special. Endgame type of script (bring everyone together to fight a common enemy) and a bad kind-of live adaptation of Spider-Man in the Spiderverse. Not wasting my time again.", "All Hail Sony and Disney": "It's truly remarkable how Sony and Disney renewed the contract that makes this to happen. OMG I'm already stunned and amazed. Green Goblin played by Willem Dafoe is indeed the main villain here, or should I say the man with clear-driven motivation. And for the rest of the supporting casts complete its perfection.And for Dr. Strange, he keeps getting better right now. He's definitely the center of MCM (Marvel Cinematic Multiverse) right now, or maybe we could get a cameo that will hint for the future projects. I can't wait for the MoM.This movie is perfect 10/10.

And specially Post Credit scenes were very important, and yes there are two.", "Story lacking": "Here, we see peter parker once again screw up and cause a huge world wide problem. What really took away from the movie for me was peter going to the most extreme route without thinking/talking first, and doctor strange being a dunce not telling the risks. Peter needs to learn from mistakes and think himself through, or else, I'm not sure if I can watch any longer. The movie played off nastalgia not to the levels of the matrix: resurrected but still was a basic fan's dream for a spiderman movie combining all spidermans.That being said, action scenes in imax were really cool, and some parts of the story were redeemable. I enjoyed watching the movie but was questionable at parts.", "Simply Amazing": "No words can describe this masterpiece. I think Andrew proved that he is an amazing spiderman, and watching him with Tobey on the screen together was very enjoyable.", "The second best of MCU and the Best Spider Man Movie of all time !": "A spectacular showcase of action, comedy,emotions,nostalgia,Thrill. This is the best spider man movie ever made(not even required to say period). The performances of all the cast is outstanding. Nostalgia all around. You're gonna cry,gonna freak out,gonna cheer your lungs out, it's that good ! This movie also like Endgame, is going to be once in a lifetime experience.", "Great concept vs horrible writing": "Yeah. Let's be honest, this is probably just as close as we'll ever get to a Sinister Six movie. Since some villains of the original group are not meant to be introduced in Tom Holland's universe (Doc Octopus for certain), this kind-of-Spiderverse does wrap up pretty well the entirety of past Spiderman movies.After all, each of all three known versions of Peter Parker does have its own charm, so seeing all three Spiderman weirdos together was a surprise meant to happen. Plus, the key connection between Parkerversions makes perfect sense as the basic element of his origin, but no spoilers here sorry, only basic descriptions for the unaware.Nevertheless, dialogues were terrible and very basic as to how the entire plot was unfolded before the audience. As if a single movie was crowded with too many topics; so they had to simplify things for any who might find it confusing. As a result, most re-introduced characters offer little insight as to who they are and what their deal is, so any interactions end up like a rushed up synopsis.Maybe I'm exaggerating? Perhaps. But think of how much better the overall flow would be if made as a two-part movie. No matter how enjoyable, I had the feeling each Marvel character (not the actors, for god's sake) competed the rest to get more minutes of extra screen time.All in all, it is only fair to say SP3 does remains a good movie and I don't see how much better it could get given the circumstances. Spiderman needs to be accessible to all ages and Marvel needed an epic SP movie to boost interest for its upcoming projects. Iron Man and original Cap are gone, Black Widow too, Thor is getting older. Not too many aces up their sleeves so it was a call too tough to be avoided. I wonder what the future holds in store and I also wonder how they will introduce Venom. Maybe it can work even better if they decide to focus on these two characters instead of adding extra villains (like Sandman and Hobgoblin).", "With great power comes great failure.": "It's a bad movie. While you have the best two stories of spiderman, there is no meaning to handle the scenario with those boring and unsuccessfully written side characters. There are no understandable logic on spidermans motivation to do things and there are no meanings of wasting screen time and messing story flow with those side characters when you have all the things you wish for making a spider-man movie. Sinister six and spiderverse couldn't been handled in a movie which is this bad. This movie is done this way because it was going to make the same amount of money either if it was bad or legendary. It's sad for the spiderman fans which knows what really could have been done with those stories. Solid 1 out of 10.", "Sdshah4070@gmil.com": "I liked it very much, thank you to the producer, it was a very good movie, he did not speak. I like this kind of movies very, very, very well.Do not let all the factors of this film hurt.", "Just another hero movie shot in green screen": "Why are real actors used to film this?And what the heck are these digital retouching on actors?Do the whole movie in 3d at once.It's cheaper, maybe.", "FAN-SERVICE": "This is the best Spider-Man movie. Does the movie have any script holes? Yea. But the performances are so perfect on the villains and heroes, alongside the interactions between characters, Fan service, character actions and jokes that they don't even make you realize the mistakes. This film marks the maturing of Peter Parker who, along with Tom Holland's impeccable acting, does it in an incredible way. The ending is perfect. MY SECOND FAVORITE MOVIE!!!!! 10/10.", "Incredibly done and sensational acting!": "Amazing film, with unbelievable CGI also very action-packed. Acting was very good and I highly recommend watching the movie, but the story is a bit sloppy, well in my opinion!", "Wonderful movie": "It was great thank you so much for this movie. It was great thank you so much for this movie. It was great thank you so much for this movie. It was great thank you so much for this movie.", "great movie to watch": "This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman. I loved every second of it!", "What a time to be a Spider-Man Fan!": "This movie is amazing start to finish.. I have never gotten out of my seat so many times for a movie. I belive every fan of spider-man will agree that this movie gives us what we want and the spider verse is officially open for live action and the possibilities are endless. Seeing Tobey and Andrew again made me feel like a child again. Thank you Marvel and Sony for an awesome experience.", "Very good movie for it's genre": "10/10 for certain scenes that are linked with previous Spiderman movies, it was great fun to watch those scene as a fan of Spiderman franchise. Some scenes weren't executed perfectly as I would like, so the score is not a 10. There were way too much cringe scenes and I thought MJ should have been presented as a little bit less emotional of a person. All in all movie eas a great fun, after credits scene were also very amusing. Would recommend if you are a fan of SF.", "very nostalgic movie": "Watching this movie was undoubtedly a great experience. The nostalgia gave me goosebumps. However, the actual plot was quite mid. Its a good movie but it has some obvious imperfections.", "Well done! So well done!!": "Almost a perfect movie, action, adventure, great story, highs and lows!! Really really good movie!!!Perhaps we could do without the random therapy sessions between Garfield and Maguire and bromance, but it didn't effect the movie,...just a bit weird and slowed it down.", "Believe the hype. The BEST MCU movie!": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is absolutely stunning. There is no other way to put it. Tom Holland carries a film full of veteran actors and delivers a sucker-punch of a performance that will make you laugh and cry buckets in equal measure. Lots of fan service for MCU and Spider-Man fans, complete with a bittersweet ending that will move most theatre goers, you just have to see the ending chapter of the Spider-Man trilogy. Absolutely awesome!", "Wait... where's my logic?": "All of a sudden, the guy who made an intergalactic trip, who was one of the avengers, etc. Becomes so dumb and childish (by making adjustments to the trick). Further it gets even worse: he sees how Dr Octopus and Goblin started killing and destroying but just because May who was going through relationship crisis says everyone deserves a chance (for which she deserved to be killed), he decides to help. And yes about the logic: (1) there were millions of people who knew about Apiderman in other universes, why only villains (who were DEAD!!) are sucked into this world? I mean parallel Spider-Man (Toby McGuire) kept aging hence are in future, but Octopus and Goblin either reincarnated or pulled from past?? But the biggest question is - did Peter kept trying to fix them all, only to send them back anyways - and we all know they would be dead when they are back? Omg - I think even 5 is too much for this movie. Changing it to 3 and only for some good cgi.Instead, his friend learns how to open the portal ACCIDENTALLY whereas it took Dr Strange forever to learn it.", "Absolute masterclass": "I thought that after watching all the marvel films from a while back, that this movie was the perfect blend of everything spiderman should face and overcome. Tom Holland really put his all into this performance and Green Goblin was an incredible menace in all ways he should be in this movie.", "Greatest Marvel movie of all time": "Marvel and sony listened to the fans and reunited 3 generations in one movie. 20 years of project, bringing back TOBEY MAGUIRE and ANDREW GARFIELD as spider man. What a great movie. Perfect.", "Doctor Strange was unbearable": "Doctor Strange was an immature child who was an expert in gaslighting -- he used his power impulsively without discussing the planning with Peter Parker on what to do and what not to do and the consequences of his spell. He should know better as it was his power. And when it went wrong he blamed Peter. The first 40 minutes of the movie was unbearable because of him. I nearly wanted to swith the video off.7 out of 10. 9 out of 10 if there is no Doctor Strange.", "Downhill": "And so we have another Spider-Man film, I couldn't help but predict most scenes and feel extremely bored.Peter Parker is yet again helpless, he can't hold his own and even will Starks technology he still hopelessly fails. Yet he can apparently best Strange...", "Spiderous!": "Better than all Spiderman Movies. This is masterpiece of Peter Parkar story ever. Everyone should watch this movie at list one time at thether. Please dont be spoiler about this movie to anyone.", "This was enough": "I was really Mesmerised the with the movie. The thetare experience was lit. The movie is vibefull emotions literally takes you to Spiderworld .Thanks to creators for this one Masterpeice .A lifetime Superhero movie for sure.", "A Marvel geek's dream.": "Honestly this is turning out to be the best super hero movie ever because the spider man movies with tobey/andrew made me fall in love with the marvel universe and this is coming full circle.", "It was enjoyable...": "Visually. The CGI was on point, and action scenes were up-to-par with recent marvel standards.Acting was mostly amazing. (pretty much only Garfield and Maguire were out of touch)The comedy was sometimes good, sometimes bad, but it was standard Marvel comedy so I cannot fault the movie too much on that.But the plot stands on a gaping hole. The whole plot revolves around numerous idiocies, such as Holland's Spider-Man being the most irresponsible main character I have ever seen. He constantly goes against common sense and wants to \"cure\" the mental illnesses of these to him previously unknown \"baddies\" that were teleported to his universe. The writing itself is irresponsible there. Dr. Strange is dumbed down to a ridiculous level just for the plot to work. (He loses in his own realm because of... geometry?)But it's fan service, and the fans love it.", "Amazing from start to finish, greatest Spider-Man movie made so far": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is a masterpiece MCU entry with lots of heart, emotion, drama, consequence, nostaligia, and of course fan-service.Spider-Man: No Way Home is easily the most anticipated movie of 2021, no doubt. The hype and the expectation for this movie were out of this world. Non-stop speculation, rumours, leaks, online discussion, and more. This movie dominated internet talk all year. It's no surprise the first trailer broke records being the most viewed trailer in under 24 hours.With so much hype and expectations, I was beginning to worry that maybe the expectations were unrealistic and that we were all setting ourselves for dissapointment. You can't have everything be perfect in a movie. But, I am more than overjoyed to say that this movie not only met those insane expectations, but surpassed them in every way possible. From start to finish I was in love with this movie.I laughed, I cried, I cheered. I did not want it to end...\nThis is simply everything you could want from a good Spider-Man movie that feels like Spider-Man, much more than the previous two MCU Spider-Man movies.This will go down in history as the greatest Spider-Man movie.", "Spider Man at its best": "Spider-Man: No Way Home gives a fair conclusion to the current trilogy and doesn't disappoint: it's fun, emotional, and nostalgic.One of the best in the MCU to date and arguably the best in the Spider-Man franchise.", "Not that bad, but cocooned out of pure fan service!": "I came out of the cinema and I felt entertained. Nevertheless, the film also caused me a certain discomfort in some situations. Basically, I would give the film a 5/10 rating. But now, when I happened to see after a few weeks what No Way Home's rating was, I was really shocked. Either the film had a completely different and closed target audience, or Sony buys more positive ratings here to flush even more money into the box office.To achieve a much more realistic rating for the movie, I therefore award a 1/10 !First of all, I have to say, I already had the impression at the first appearance of Tom Holland as Spider-Man in Civil War, hey he is way too young, way too self-confident and then he also begged the whole time for the recognition of Tony Stark. For me, that was definitely not the starting signal to see more of Spidy.And later my first impression was confirmed. Information was leaked from Sony Pictures where the executives exchanged emails and discussed what they would like to see in the film. They wanted to reach even more teenagers with a Facetime call here, a bit of Tiktok there and WhatsApp messages flying in and the actors should talk in memes. Isn't that weird? It's all too money driven for me.Much of the movie feels like the director went on Reddit and asked, hey what have you always wanted to see in a Spider-Man movie. There were some cool ideas too, but overall it's just too much, too much fan service. I didn't mind at all that we got to see the other two Spider-Man there. Even though he aged a bit, it was cool to see Tobey Maguire and again, you saw he was the best Spider-Man. He can spin his own webs, he doesn't need any technical tools. But there were also too many villains, the movie doesn't have time to take care of them. I would say the Green Goblin and Doc Oc would have been enough.But the worst thing I find is why there is a story at all! Spidy wants Dr. Strange to make sure no one knows he's Spider-Man anymore. It's told how incredibly dangerous this spell is, and Steven says \"Let's do that!\" That doesn't make any sense at all, because the Dr. Strange who resisted giving the Time Stone to Thanos for so long in Infinity War is now going to cast this spell so easily because the little brat isn't feeling well right now?The movie is all about bad decisions. In many films you are taught to listen to the old, they have more life experience and you can only profit from them. And then the young people often act on their own, fall flat on their face and then have the realization. And that is so not true here. As I was sitting in the movie, I actually had this feeling of \"Oh, Aunt May will know what she's talking about!\" No, she doesn't. She also acts incredibly stupid. The villains who have already been beaten and killed in another universe deserve another chance? I don't necessarily want to call him Spider-Man, so Tom Holland should have known better, Dr. Strange wasn't around at the time, but he already knew the damage that playing with time can do. Did he not see Loki? By the way, the TVA could have intervened long ago. These variants must have thrown the spacetime fabric into chaos long ago, instead it's business as usual with just 5 more supervillains.Just as illogical is the fight between Tom and Dr. Strange. This scene when he doesn't want to hand over the cube clearly shows that he is no Spider-Man, no Avenger. He behaves here like a 5-year-old child who has just learned to speak and has to make his first decisions.In summary, the movie is entertaining overall, but consists of pure fan service and has an illogical story in which already introduced characters behave completely against their principles just to push the story forward. I hope Dr. Strange can fix that in the next film.", "Just one question...": "Pretty much everything good everyone else has written is spot on...except for one thing that ruined the movie at the end...and I'm surprised no one else has stopped to realize how stupid...moronic...just down-right idiotic it was, for a kid knowing his two best friends were about to forget he EVER EXISTED...WHY DID HE SWING AWAY!?!?!?!?I mean, what easier way to help these two remember than to stick around for the spell to complete (because they WILL remember that they helped Spiderman defeat all these bad guys, just not why...) to explain why they were now stuck on Liberty Island...they were the only two people that WERE NOT going to \"disappear\".It would not have destroyed the spell. Dr. Strange as well, would have known Spiderman from Thanos; Peter, could have talked to his friends, explained what was going on, and then all four gone back to Sanctuorum and Peter then could have revealed himself to them there.Just saying, Peter has been made out to be goofy, but not stupid. This ending was completely unnecessary and disappointing.", "Awesomeness": "MUST MUST MUST SEE!!!!!!! Great movie Sony is finally putting these spiderman movies together. I really hope they are getting everything in line for the Sinister Six.", "AN EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER": "SPOILER ALERT!!!!!From start to finish it had me at the edge of my seat! I didn't think a movie could unlock so many emotions at once. 10/10 and by far the best Spider-Man to be made. Toms acting to Aunt Mays death was easily one of the best death scenes shot in the MCU. Andrew and Tobey both were so amazing, Although I do feel like Andrew stole the show. Such an emotional rollercoaster watching all 3 spidermen remise losing their loved ones and to top it off Andrew saving MJ where he could finally forgive himself after Gwen was just the icing on the cake. William Dafoe is hands down the greatest Spider-Man villain and with his calibre of acting he knows what it takes to bring out the ultimate evil mastermind. Overall such an amazing experience and will be for sure going to watch it for the 3rd time this week!", "Amazing movie.": "Definitely one of my favourites for a long time. Always good to watch best childhood superhero and my heart's favourite actor Andrew Garfield. Love the sound love the picture and just love the story. Amazing come backs, comedy moments that I could laugh my face of and heartbreaking scenes that I just loved and never forget. Was good to really see the emotions on big screen, actors did their best and looking ahead for what's coming next.", "Entertaining & Overhyped!": "This movie is entertaining to watch but I didn't find a strong story to give a rating of more than SEVEN! This movie is definitely overhyped & should not be on the list of IMDb's top 100 movies! The current rank is 71, which is weird and also disrespectful to the other top movies.", "Something I had never seen before, greatly executed": "I dont have a lot of words to describe what I watched tonight, it was simply beautiful and well executed. Tom Holland was simply amazing and the story captivating every second. I was expecting much due to the trailers and hype, and Im not disappointed at all. This is undoubtedly the best spider man movie ever made and it will be extremely hard to top it off.", "Mediocre at best": "Marvel fanboys are hyping this up way to kuch the movie isn't even good untle the third act,don't get me wrong it's a really fun movie and i enjoyed it a lot but it definitely isn't the best spider-man movie or the best Marvel movie those are held by Into the Spiderverse and Avengers: Infinity War and Civil War tied.It's a fun movie but not as good as the fans are hyping it up to be and this is coming from a long time MCU fan.", "Bold and Groundbreaking": "As someone who grew up on Sam Raimi's original movies, this newest film feels like a special gift. All cast members give excellent performances, with Tom Holland's Peter Parker always keeping the film emotional themes grounded, no matter how far into the multiverse the stunning visuals take us. The film also isn't afraid to tackle ideas that feel very relevant while also preserving the unique identity of all the characters. While some story points don't entirely hold up to scrutiny, the film knows exactly what audiences want and isn't afraid to give it to them fully. For that, it is possibly the most outright entertaining film of the year.", "Good Cash": "Good action\nGood role\nGood actor\nSpider man very good film in the world.We (people world)favorite film in the Asia,America, Africa, Europe.Just bad story.", "How can anyone not like this": "I was a bit Marvelled out after End Game. It felt like anything was being put out with little effort as it was a guaranteed hit.This film is funny, exciting, original and emotional at the same time. It is by far the best Marvel film for some time if not ever. All 3 Spiderman are still fantastic, I'm from the Toby Maguire generation so he was always my favourite.Andrew Garfield I never rated and always thought the Amazing Spiderman films were best forgotten but again he was fantastic in this. William Dafoe is brilliant as Green Goblin too, in fact all of the actors were brilliant.Fantastic from start to finish, it gets an 8 and not higher because at the end of the day it is just a superhero film so can't be considered an all time classic in my view, but it is AMAZING for what it is :)", "Standard Marvel Fare": "The film is enjoyable and has great special effects. The plot is ok, not great, and the script is somewhat childish.It would be good to see some more creativity with respect to the plot of the Marvel films. Sadly, they are all too predictable - and a great plot makes a great movie, not special effects. Take CODA for example, which has no effects, but is a much better film in my opinion.", "Best Spider-Man movie!": "This is definitely a spider man movie that just can't be topped. There is so much that is great about the movie.I think Willem Dafoe's acting in this was insane! Even better than his last spider man film.", "The Best Spider-Man fan fiction ever.": "Spider-Man No Way Home is a pandering, fan service epic made for the lowest common denominator of Marvel Fans. But yet its so entertaining that I can look over all these problems. Fan service can work if the people who make the movie actually put care and respect to what they make. The references go beyond what they're supposed and actually integrate well into the story. Even without the references, the movie brings alot of great acting to the table with the biggest showstopper being Willem Dafoe reprising his role as the Green Goblin. Yes all the original villains and hero's came back and gave great performances for the most part, but Dafoe comes out on top. Another amazing aspect to this movie were all the action sequences. Out of all the MCU Spider-Man movies, this one stands out at having the best. They remain so engaging and thrilling that it's bound to keep you at the edge of your seat. At the end of the day, Spider-Man No Way Home delivers at keeping me and it's audience entertained. The fact they were able to put so much into this movie and make it good in the end shows how much respect the filmmakers have for their fans even if it's at the expense of their wallets.", "So worth it": "Im terrible at keeping my attention on movies and this one just held it the entire time. Was awesome seeing all these call backs and references all over the movie. And damn were all the actors on point and just loving what they do.", "Best non animated spiderman movie.": "Best non animated spiderman movie period. Nothing else needed to be said here.It has all:\ngood entertaining plot\nGreat acting\nGreat actors\nFan service.", "more of the same, more fanservice, more deadpool jokes": "I went there because of the high rating and critics.The movie has nothing to do with the old Spider-Man atmosphere.Well, people clapped in the cinema when Tobey Maguire appeared.Its a movie full of fanservice. Like the new Star Wars movies. But has nothing new or creative.CGI of course is at its best. But movies are more than CGI, fanservice, copied storylines, attempts to copy Deadpool jokes and not presenting too serious.This was the last Superhero for me if not a very dark Batman movie is coming back.", "Spider-Man: No Way Home - The greatest superhero of all time!!!": "NOTE- This review does not contain any spoilers.... You can read it without any hesitation.. Next, I would strongly recommend to watch the Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy(2002-2007), Marc Webb's The amazing Spider-Man series(2012-2014) and Jon Watts' Spider-Man Homecoming trilogy(2017-2021)...I just walked out of the theater watching Spider-Man No Way Home.. We laughed, we screamed at the top of our lungs, we cried/bawling at multiple times, we clapped continuously.. Once in a lifetime experience!!The actors have done a great job.. Tom Holland And Willem Dafoe simply stole the show!!! Willem Dafoe just delivered a legendary performance as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin.. The supporting actors did very well.. All of them were superb..The music/Soundtrack was composed by Michael Giacchino and he did it so well!!Talking about the other crew like the Director Jon Watts.. His way of direction has changed a lot after the last 2 movies of the homecoming trilogy! Brilliant camera angles at many moments of the movie..After Shang Chi And Eternals we all thought that Marvel Cinematic Universe does not have much left.. But after watching this movie, I can say that the multiverse saga has just begun and Marvel has more in store for us... There are 2 post credits scene and both of them are just mind-blowing...Can Spider-Man: No Way Home be regarded as the greatest superhero movie of all time???Definitely yes!!!", "Pops wasn't impressed. But I was": "I think this film is for a certain age. One that can enjoy it for nostalgia.I was sat next to my 12 year old and my dad at 75.I'm 36.I felt at times it was slow and predictable.Then when fighting started I was thrown into action packed fun. Had its moments of sadness and cheeky laughter.But all in all. I would watch again and would probably like it more.My 12 year old said she liked it ,but the green goblin was scary at times. I agreed. William played his part perfectly and reminded us that he's a spectacular actor.My dad I could hear sighing quite a few times. And when the other spidermen turned up he gave a loud \"oh god why\". That made me regret bringing him as he was quite lost as to what was happening.And at the end of the film was not a happy bunny.But to be fair I think it might have been paying \u00a330 for 3 small popcorn and some drinks that started him off.I don't think he liked the playful attitude of Tom Holland and said that Spider-Man was over for him. He liked the Toby Maguire ones and that is that.So yeah.Make your own minds up.", "Amazing movie (except for the movie)": "Like in most of the Marvel movies, you won't go to the theater for the story. It feels like a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. 2/10\nThe acting is good even if I don't like Zendaya, (MJ is quite bad in this universe). 8/10\nSpecial effects and music are amazing. 10/10\nIt is definitely not a waste of time but I don't get the hype around this movie.", "A film that finally unites the fanbase": "As a fan of the character, those I always felt the series peaked in the Raimi era. Those films managed to capture the essence of Peter Parker as much of and him trying to navigate between leading a double life as Peter Parker and Spider-Man to perfection.While those focused on much of the emotional depth of the relationship of its characters, while having memorable elements in every aspect, from the Parker luck, staying true for the most part to the classic take of the source material and characters, while having an amazing visuals, depth, fantastic action scenes and score. They were eventful. They felt big, they were big and an experience to witness and anticipate in theaters. I haven't had that feeling ever since, and my inner fan kept eagerly to try and regain it, to a point I already lost hope it will happen ever again. That was until No Way Home arrived.Now I'll admit, The MCU version did not appealed to me. I supported it as the fan that I am to the character, but was still looking for that \"old\" excitement and anticipation to be recaptured, still in the search of a feeling that they could do better. Cause they already did that before! And they have so much material to work with! And yet, I kept getting disappointed. The MCU Take, felt too kid friendly, that took away the independence and brilliance of the character, it lacked depth, it was focused to appeal to mostly younger generation, it changed characters for the sake of current climate, it made Peter rely solely on new shiny suits, and tech, and Spider-Man couldn't afford to have his very own villains not be connected to Iron Man, and becomes the very character he resent in the comics, and in much better films.While I did had anticipation with seeing the beloved characters from both eras of Raimi's trilogy, and Webb's duology, I kept my expectations intact, cause this version was stuck in a time loop and refused to let the character grow and develop for so long.But oh, boy, yeah that it found a way to redeem itself and finish this trilogy with a big bang!Not only it leans much it evolves new with nostalgia and fan service, it actually goes in depth in diving into the roots and lore of the past characters, and evolve the MCU Spider-Man in the ways we kept waiting and hoped to see.There is a huge progress, and real consequences that are being taken place, and while the film does lean on much of the past characters and nostalgia, it does not feels cynical, or a bait, and have much heart and respect towards them and their stories. Every single one of them have time to shine, without the film being convoluted, and crammed, with too many characters, and subplots together.The film just keeps you on the edge of your seat with every moment, and recapturing your inner child/teen excitement you thought you lost long ago.Holland's Spider-Man is developing to his own independent hero we've been waiting for him to be. The film does not only bring closure to him by developing from being out in the shadow of more established characters in this universe, but also helps to bring closure and open a possibly new era of the old characters as well.I had absolute blast while watching this, not only it was a love letter to all Spider-Man fans, both cinematic and comic wise, but it did it wonderfully with uniting such divided fanbase.Hollywood proved when they focus on giving fans what they want and love, the fans will support them back with love and support. And the huge success this film has proves it.", "Greatest cinema experience I've ever had": "I luckily managed to even avoid the main trailer before watching the actual movie and I'm so so happy about it.The story, the drama, the action, the comedy - almost impeccable.Cannot remember ever experiencing something like this.10/10.", "Not that bad, I didn't get dissapointed": "I always thought Tobey Maguire wasn't that great, but I changed my opinion after this new actor, Tom Holland. I'm not saying anything bad, but to me the best is Tobey. Now I get it, he is irreplaceable, I miss him and I think he did a great job in this movie fighting alongside the new kiddo. Andrew Garfield on the other hand... well, yeah, not my favorite.I think this movie mix all the good stuff, different universes with the previous spider-mans, Dr Strange (this was the key of this movie), he is amazing, and a great plot with a well solved ending.", "Ridiculously Overrated": "Storyline is very weak, action is just ok, bad acting in some moments, very overrated. A lot of unnecessary scenes, bad drama and a very wiered Toby Maguire. Overall I would give a 6.5 at most.. It's not even close to Avengers: Infinity War and it has a higher rating, ridiculous.", "The Spider-Verse Is Real!": "We asked for it and they delivered, The Spider-Verse is real and we got to see Andrew and Tobey again. The whole movie was an emotional roller coaster. I can't believe a movie like this one exists, it's AMAZING! 10/10 please go watch it!!!", "Outstanding Performance by All": "Amazing picture, felt like the classic \"Marvel'' experience. When Peter Parker was introduced I got chills, seeing the villains from the OG Spriderman's was so nostalgic. I've already purchased this from Amazon Prime Video, 1. To support the film creators 2. I couldn't wait to watch it again.", "Spider-Man: nostalgia": "Good:Nostalgia\nGood action\nMore nostalgiaBad:\nWhat am I gonna do if me and my friends can't get into MIT??It's all Peter parker's fault. All of it.", "Nothing besides nostalgia": "Throughout the movie it felt ok. I can just say it is an average movie with great VFX. It felt like studio and director didn't know what to do and brought in all Spiderman villains into one and made 3 Spidermen fight against their old villains. Characterization felt very shallow and May's death didn't come close to the impact of Uncle Ben's death from Toby Maguire's Spiderman. Overall it is just a one time watch. Not sure why people go gaga over every Marvel movie.", "Best Marvel Movie!!": "I've seen all 3 Tom Holland Spider-Man movies, and out of the 2 (Homecoming and Far From Home) and I liked Far From Home the best, but when I saw this one (No Way Home) it completely changed it, this one is my new favorite Spider-Man movie. You should definitely see it if you get the chance or when it comes out of theaters.SPOILERS BELOW:I thought it was really cool how they all connected with each other after Tom Holland's Spider-Man lost Aunt May. I wasn't expecting that.", "The Emotional ride": "The movie is awesome...it's completely filled with emotions. After the endgame I think this was the best shot which Marvel showed his mark..Marvel universe is not just action and VFX it's all about emotions and ethics which was well shown in the movie...apart from VFX movie gathered the attention of audience quite well...it's a complete story based picture and a gateway to the upcoming multiverse concept.", "Tiny bit disappointed but still loved it.": "I loved this movie. It was so fun to watch the story unfold, and although everyone expected the \"surprise\" it still gave everyone a great reaction. Although I can still admit there were things about the movie that I did not like, the whole plot is kinda weird because Spider-man wants Dr. Strange to do a spell and make everyone forget who he is with a few exceptions, but it somehow got messed up and now a bunch of parallel universes are coming in and they realize they messed up, try to fix it, and basically redo the spell but the original way. Meaning there could have easily been no movie had Spider-man been a little more cautious and smarter by only letting MJ and/or Ned remember.The other thing that I really disliked is the ending, it's sad that no one knows who he is anymore, had the spell could have somehow worked and some people still know, It could've been more enjoyable. I also thought that Ned was gonna become a sorcerer now that he learned to open portals, but I'm not even sure anymore. I don't know what's next for Spider-man but I hope it makes everyone forgetting worth it.I was also confused on the first end credit scene where we see Venom talking to the bartender and basically just appears in the universe and then leaves. In the Venom 2's end credit scene he appears in the universe and leaves a cliffhanger so I kind of expected him to play a role, but he just leaves a bit of the symbiote behind, which only leads me to think that someone else is gonna get it and become Venom, meaning a re-casting, which kind of dissapointed me cause I really like Tom Hardy's version of Venom.So even though there were a few things I didn't like, and the plot being a little questionable, the movie was absolutely insane. Hearing the reactions in theaters was so cool and I would watch this movie over and over again, I just hope there's more to the story than just everyone forgetting. Overall I wouldn't rate this anything below a 9.I also want to quickly say that Andrew Garfield was amazing in this movie. The scene where he breaks down when talking with Tom's Spider-man about Gwen, as well as MJ after catching her was so powerful I was about to shed a tear as well.", "A badly written comic superhero movie": "Too much funny lines.. some of the moments makes no sense in the movie.. the only good thing was 3 amigos rest was average... villains could have handled better, too long takes.Sandman's actor shot was literally taken from spiderman 3..lol low budget issue.Still top 3 movies are\nSpiderman 2\nThe amazing spider-man\nSpiderman 2002.", "Felt something missing but...": "Just hear me out! Don't get me wrong the movie was great but I still felt like if finally Tobey and Andrew are back possibly for the last time then why not extend the movie( 3 hrs ) and shed a bit of focus on them. I know they do not want the lime light to go away from tom but the way Into the spider verse showcased how the other spider people ended in a different universe with a back story would have been great for both( showing what happened after Spiderman 3 and TASM 2), maybe bringing the MJ from Raimi verse and aunt may from TASM and have a bit of story telling on how the life has been for these Spiderman's and how they landed in MCU( Exactly the way they do in Into the spider verse with the storytelling for all of them and a 2-3 min background information ). Just to say that instead just the villains and heroes would have great if other characters form both universes also came who knew \"Peter Parker\" and not make a huge coincidence. BTW these things aside great movie with the Tom's Spiderman getting mature and comic accurate and pulling off the near impossible, hats of to everyone behind this perfect film.", "Best Spidy Movie ever": "Till date the best spiderman movie. I wonder if Marvel has really planned about it 10 years back? How tdo they really exceed expectations in each marvel movies and super hero character.", "Really Good, but Fan Service Clouds Weak First 2 Acts": "***SPOILERS***Let me start by saying Spider-Man: No Way Home was a really good movie. Seeing it in theaters was a great experience, and something I've been missing since late 2019. It was really fun seeing Charlie Cox back as Matt Murdock, who would be the first of many returning to their beloved roles of the past. Willem Dafoe absolutely stole the show as Green Goblin, and Alfred Molina didnt miss a beat as Doc Ock. Jamie Fox was Jamie Fox, and the other villians seemed like copied footage from their original movies, just repurposed for this film.The portal scene when Andrew Garfield and Tobey came back as their original Spider-Man incarnations was probably one of the greatest scenes of cinematic history for me personally because I grew up watching Tobey and appreciated Andrew's acting abilities in his own films. Even on my 2nd watching I still had chills and enjoyed every moment they were on screen.However, the whole first 2 acts before the other Spideys arrive just fall flat somewhat. As enjoyable as they were, the story and motivations were all over the place. It seemed to me as the writers knew the payoff (old villians and Spideys returning to the big screen) before writing the hook and kind of just made their way through it. It worked, but it wasn't strong and I feel watching this movie years from now people will see that, and the fan service moments will be even more obvious, and wont feel quite the same.Infinity War and Endgame are still top 2 Marvel movies of all time, and this is definitely top-5. These are my opinions, and I am no critic.", "It's not endgame but it's close!": "Wow what a movie! All there is to say is go see it!In my opinion it doesn't beat endgame but it gets remarkably close!Defo one to see on the big screen, great atmosphere with moments of the audience cheering/clapping!9/10.", "Cult film": "It's an amazing film with lot of action, emotional,and comedic secenes .As a Spiderman fan from childhood I loved the movie too much. I am not getting into the spoilers but you must watch this film in theatre as it is a visual treat \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "Great!": "This is a great film! This film shows how you can have serious moments in these blockbusters. I am VERY happy that this trilogy was about Peter becoming Spider-Man, and the next will be about Peter Coping with being Spider-Man. I also REALLY LOVE that they went back to Peter being independent and not with someone always watching over him or giving him guidance. There was a big twist in every one of these marvel Spider-Man movies, the first one being, Adrian being Liz's dad, the second one Being Mysterio was a bad guy the whole time, and this last one being that this trilogy was never a Spider-Man trilogy, it was a Peter Parker trilogy, they don't put that right in your face, but you just know it. I REALLY love his new homemade stitched up suit! Its so cool and accurate to the comics! I never would have thought that this was the plan for marvel to have this first trilogy be like an origin to Spider-Man and the second one being his adventures, and if Tom Holland isn't to old, a last trilogy where it's the last of Spider-Man...", "They Made A Masterpiece": "Spider-Man is one of the weakest characters, but the best movies are in the Spider-Man series. I ask Marvel to make films of this quality for strong characters as well.", "Spider Man: A Culmination of Everything Awesome about Spider Man": "As someone who loves the Sam Raimi and the MCU Spider Man movies (including Into the Spider Verse) I thought this movie did such an awesome job of integrating all the Spider Man universes that ended up working out for everyone (no matter which Spider Man fan you're a fan of; Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield or Tom Holland they bring out the best from each of them). This may be my new personal favorite Spider Man movie, period. If you haven't done so, please go see this amazing movie in theaters and get the experience you deserve!! It's absolutely worth it!!!! Reading these reviews don't do justice here, you need to experience it!", "it was good but...": "I love spiderman movie but hmm this movie must 3 hour, why 3 hour? Too many characters (main and villain) must need character deepening in this movie. If this movie 3 hour i'll loved this overall my rating is 8/10.", "Best spiderman film ever": "Best film it is, To be honest it'll be the first successful triology, as spider man 3 was not that good, but MCUs spiderman 3 was more than awesome and the 2nd best triology in MCU 1st one is cap(i liked iron man duology rather than 3rd part no offence I am first Iron man fan and than cap's fan) the thing is I was never this hyped since infinity war and endgame but than came no way home. Spiderman homecoming was good but not hyped, only went for tony stark cameo, since I was frustrated as this was the second reboot of spiderman but it made a perfect triology hats of to Tom Holland and Jon watts and marvel made endgame in such a way that fans will definitely go for far from home and it was better than homecoming even though there was no tony stark, and the climax led to no way home that's what makes it a perfect triology, only if stan was alive, thanks you marvel for bringing back our childhood that's all I want to say.", "Entertainmening and Enjoyable Spidey Film": "Spider has always been a movie that never quite kept everyone happy as everybody has a certain expectation of their most beloved characters.This movie solves all this by throwing everything spiderman related and created at you in just over 2 hours.The movies bounces up and down in the he first half and starts to take form in the second half. Tom Holland delivers strongly on the emotionally side of things. Itge villains have all been refined and are a lot slicker. Hats off to Willem Dafoe for pulling it out of the bag a second time. Tobey Maguire was always one the weakest of the 3 Spidermen. It shows here. His acting chops don't match Andrew or Tom. For nostalgia reasons and the purposes of the story he fit in well. I always found Andrew Garfield the best of the 3 with the worse movies. Garfield really shines in.this movie and I think he steals every scene. It's a shame the movies he was in were not of a higher calibre..\nIn conclusion this movie is a fun ride that pays a massive service to fans of the movies and comics alike. While it is still light viewing for the most part it is a roller coaster of emotions. Some of the darkest Spiderman scenes filmed take place in this movie.. The plot is a bit messy and clunky. Dr Strange kind of feels out of place in the movie. Understandably the situations could not have taken place without him. Some of the fight scene are not great but this is not where the heart of this movie is. It's a story of Spiderman finally understanding the motto he wears on his sleeve. With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility. This movie achieves that.", "Good film as all marvel films are... though its not a 10 or a 9 for that matter.": "Very good film. However I can't fathom why it's rated the highest marvel movie ever. It can't rival infinity wars/end game or the GOTG 1/2 or winter soldier/civil war/black panther... A good film for nostalgia and some decent scenes however. Just doing the review as soo many are putting it on a pedestal that I'm sure is baffling the powers that be in the marvel universe. This is being rated higher than the highest grossing films ever and it was completed with a far lower budget.", "Good fan service... And excellent launch for 4th phase": "So, I thought that after Endgame, Marvel could not develop another arc for anything or anyone anymore, that it would be the end of everything and everything should start anew.I was (to my extreme surprise and pleasure) wrong.Not only everything continues where they left off but actually they go way beyond on before, yes even before Ironman, before Avengers, and onto other \"universes\" where there are no avenger, no Doctor Strange, no stones, no Endgame.Best film on the franchise. And seen from the second end credits scene which is basically a trailer of Doctor Strange in the multiverse of madness, there will be others that shall break the record of this one.Brace yourselves, because \"things just got out of hand\" !", "Overhyped for nothing": "It only gets good reviews because there were 3 spidermans at the same time.But to be honest it was the first movie ever that made me regret the money spent on the ticket. It's never happened to me before. But this movie annoyed the hell out of me with mediocre writing, average music and a 1/10 plot and dialogues.", "Reassessed": "It's a great movie, but it's overrated. If it wasn't for spiders from other parts, it would have failed. In some cases, the plot is neither logical nor comprehensible. The film is good but not worthy of the highest praise.", "Genius": "It's the best movie I've ever seen. The actors are perfect, and their playing can't be without praise. The appearance of spiders is spectacular and unexpected. I will recommend the film to everyone I know. Very nice!", "I expected more": "I went to see this movie on the day of release. To be honest , I went with such anticipation , with such burning eyes, but the film disappointed.I wouldn't call myself a Marvel fan, but lately I've been watching these movies. Of course, I watched Spider-Man, so I expected more. I would call it a children's movie for once. If we compare it with \"the first Avenger\", then Spider-Man is at the level of cartoons for children aged 12. Of course, if you are an ardent fan of superheroes, then you will like any movie at any age , but my opinion is that this movie is boring and uninteresting.", "High hopes, disappointing delivery": "I was so excited to see it, all the past characters coming in to play and make sense of the multiverse. However, met with disappointment.Yet again, we are brought yet ANOTHER Spider-Man movie that is delivering a narrative that our webbed hero causes his own catastrophes due to poor decision making, then trying to recover from it only causing more damage. At this point, they should have left Spider-Man at Civil War.The entire cast has done well playing their parts, but the writers of this new self-destructive calamity continue to deliver terrible narrative that constantly makes Spider-Man an idiot with a good heart.", "A Comic Book Dream": "Just like the comics, the movie brings lots of heart, fun, nostalgia, tears of joy and sadness, all the craziness that drives crowds to theaters.A great effort that capture the essence of one of the most beloved characters of our time.Lots of plot holes, but it is not a problem though, the script sticks to the characters brought in this adventure, to show how difficult it is to be Spider Man AND Peter Parker all at once, what is at stake when you are trying to save your neighborhood (and the world!) from bad guys while you are just a broke teenager trying to apply to college.We truly see Peter Parker's traumas, doubts, challenges and greatness, everything that makes him so loveable and popular.While it does not excel technically, this may be the greatest super hero story ever told.", "Some spoilers so be warned.": "To start this is the best Tom Holland Spider-Man film. His performance was brilliant, I wasn't really a fan of his version until now, compared to tobey and Andrews version, he really nailed it, perfect Peter Parker and perfect Spider-Man. Don't get me wrong homecoming and far from home are great films but no way home is his best!This film is fantastic, great story (which nearly made me cry) that manages to bring all of the best bad guys to the MCU, however I was a little bit disappointed that doc connors and flint Marko were sidelined for doc oc, Norman Osborn and electro. It would have been nice if they were more involved, it felt kind of rushed with them but I guess you can't have everything and they needed bag guys, they were still great though and it fixes the too many bad guys in Spider-Man 3. Also I wish some of the baddies stayed at the end instead of being zapped back to there universe, would love to see Norman back again, but who knows what the future could bring in the next trilogy.It was such a massive nostalgia trip I loved it from start to finish, loved to see some old faces return. I just wish we saw more of them not just in the 3rd act, hopefully we will see them again in the future.It was also great that you got to see more of New York, which I always thought it was missing in homecoming.It made me feel like I was 12 again watching Tobey maguire on the big screen. I highly recommend this film to anyone, you don't need to watch any other Tom Holland Spider-Man films. Maybe just the tobey maguire trilogy and Andrew Garfield's.Can't wait to see this again. Hope you all enjoy as much as I did.", "Most awaited marvel movie and really full paisa wasool movie": "I watched this movie with my friends and during watching the movie both are enjoy it so much. I watched this movie with my friends and during watching the movie both are enjoy it so much. I'm not sure how anyone could have seen the spider man movies, and not understand the importance of them. They are good for their entertainment value, but also good for their deep themes, and underlying meanings. I love spiderman. I'm a big fan of Spiderman. I've seen all the movies, played the games, and know everything there is to know about this badass superhero. Spider-man is an experience you can't miss. It has all the action, emotion, and humor you're craving. You'll have fun watching it over and over again!", "Spiderman no way home": "The film was amazing and it's fan surveying and the plot was good everything thing in this movie especially the enhance of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire.", "Not a 9 in general, but an easy 9 in the context of the MCU": "Absolutely spoiler-free review.The general hype for this movie for months and months on end was unreal. The elephant in the room being whether or not Tobey and Andrew would appear. Whatever happened, I was confident that Jon Watts and the writers would do an excellent job given the past movies, particularly the first one.I was incredibly relieved and indredulous when managed to sit in the local IMAX, which was near full, day after the premiere, with no spoilers having made their way to me. And I can only say it was one of those rare cinema experiences that I'm absolutely thrilled I've had.What really struck me the most was the pacing, the writing, and the perfect balance between excellent comedic moments (done in a much more realistic and candid way, never ever out of place) and drama that really absolutely punches you in the gut, all interwoven incredibly well.The writing not only respects Peter Parker as a high school teenager, but also portrays that aspect in a very realistic and sincere way that's not common in big films at all, let alone a MCU entry. And the personal and more grounded personal connections and communication between Peter/MJ/May/Happy/Strange feels so very real and relatable, it was a joy to watch from beginning to end.After (imo) mediocre and passable entries like Black Widow and Eternals, and the (imo) okay-ish Shang-Chi, I was feeling almost angry at Marvel for not managing to keep a minimum standard of quality, especially after IW/Endgame. Yet, I left my seat so incredibly happy to have so been blown away, it's been 48 hours since I did, and I'm still thinking about the movie and absurdly hyped for it.To me, this was an incredible breath of fresh air in the whole superhero movie scene. I would put it up there with Infinity War in terms of what was achieved with this entry. If you follow the MCU, go see it asap before getting spoiled. Again, this is one of those rare experiences you need to have in the theater for full context effect.", "The loss.. The cope": "I admired this movie as it seems human. You laugh.. U make mistake.. You learn. You lose.. U move on.circle of life\nHope they focus more on the human part of the superheros\nVery good movie waiting for doctor strange.", "There are no special effects that can help such a bad story": "It's a typical superhero plot infused with bad decisions and political correctiveness. I was honestly happy that those terrible decisions carried a serious consequence to whom made them (sort of).It may help you kill a couple of hours of life, but you won't be any better after it.", "Brilliant, Superb, Exceptional, Mesmerizing": "Before reading this review rest assured, it DOES NOT contain spoilers and I am not even 1% biased about the movie i am not a marvel fanboy and i will never be, i ve watched a lot of serious and amazing movies from the 60s to the 00s so don't take my review as irrelevant just because i am a marvel fan boy cause i ain't.Where do I start? When I watched Far From Home back in 2020 I felt incomplete, i wanted to see whats next for tom's spiderman and i really wanted to watch the 3rd movie asap. After watching No Way Home, although it sets up many things for the future of the mcu i feel complete and i believe this is the perfect end for Tom's trilogy.Despite still being the marvel movie we all know, with it's humor which tends to be cringe most of the times this movie still gave something more, something u havent felt before, especially if you are an old school marvel fan u will admire this movie more. The amount of nostalgia, happiness, sadness, morality and goosebumps this movie gave me is immeasurable. The cinema erupted in many scenes and when the movie ended(we still saw the 2 post credits scene) me and my friends ended up in tears of joy, and i couldn't sleep because i was thinking of this movie. You really need to see this movies in the cinema and its most recommended to watch it in IMAX or Atmos. I didn't expect from marvel to pull something like this and i am congratulating them, its the best mcu movie to date and it completely surpasses infinity war and endgame which were based on hype. After 2 years of mid content (the gap between ffh and nwh is disappointing imo) they bounced back with No way home and i seriously doubt they will do something like this again.Now, every movie has it's flaws and so does No Way Home. I am not gonna say much about it's flaws cause i am gonna dive into spoilers. I didn't like Jamie Foxx's acting, he needed to have a more serious role he was trying to be cool and he was so cringe. I know it still is marvel but it could have had less cringe jokes this time, come on marvel make a serious movie.You might thing I am exaggerating right now but this movie actually deserves a lot of oscars, and even the best picture one. No other movie is actually better than nwh this year, its actually better in most aspects than other 2021 movies and it truly deserves recognition from the academy but i doubt it will get it cause it is a comic book movie. But believe me, its much more than that. The plot, the characters, the emotions, the cinematography and the nostalgia this movie can give u will not find it in other movies this year. I know winning best picture is high unlikely though deserved, at least it needs to win oscars for the technical aspects (editing, sound mixing, visual effects etc.)So, closing this review I beg you to go watch this movie to the cinema, u will feel ecstasy, just like i felt, the emotions are unbelievable. A truly amazing cinematic experience that will be remembered and brought things together that no other studio has the guts to actually pull this off. Keep ur expectations high, so that this movie will exceed them. 10/10.", "Nothing original....jumped the shark.": "Enough with the comic book movies. Recycled crap.

Because this film is being driven by fanservice, every minute is spent blitzing you to old characters you've seen before in previous films. They make a few jokes, banter off other old characters, and then the film moves onto the next to do the whole thing again.Even though this is a neat novelty, it doesn't weigh in to becoming a truely great film - which is a shame, because some of the raw emotional scenes are very clever and have absolutely nothing to do with the old universe characters they've introducted.", "A Cinema Experience Like No Other": "Spider-Man: No Way Home\n(Directed by Jon Watts)Spider-Man fights Doctor Strange in this movie and that's not even the craziest thing that happens. Without a doubt, one of the most joyous and simultaneously heartbreaking cinema experiences ever.There are moments in this film that had the crowd sounding like a full concert. The way the movie worked perfectly with a super stacked cast is a testament to the team at Marvel. That's why the MCU has succeeded for 12+ years, they keep their stories fresh, they give the fans what they want and they know how to make great movies...and this is one amazing movie.I will watch this again and again and again. Director Jon Watts has managed to pull off the impossible, no one would've dreamed years ago that this movie was possible.To some it might just be another superhero film, but to the ones who grew up with these characters...this is something else.

If Marvel wouldn't have showed the other villans, it would have been way more exciting to watch it in the cinema. Also I think it wasn't that good, because the fights were short and the movie would have been better, if it would have been longer and have more fights and the spidermans find out about each others. Movie is overrated and there are way better Marvel movies, wich have been rated lower. Also I think Marvel should stop with the MCU or make a new Universe, because it's getting boring with the bunch of new movies and stupid with the whole Multi-verse. Great movies with great crossovers, but as I said overrated .", "Waste of time": "Simply put the multiverse is about the many worlds of Spiderman. Not the many worlds of Peter Parker.

It may seem harsh, but Tom Holland has not been and will not be as big as a Spider-Man.", "Stranger than strange": "I have a problem understanding how the other critics can give this movie such a high grade. Almost 200K thinks this is a 10/10. Previous Spider-Man movies from this franchise has a score of 7,4 so this is a huge step up in grading this movie. Therefore this is seen as the perfect Spider-Man movie without any flaws. Is that really true? Not at all. I enjoyed the movie, don't get me wrong, but this is far from a perfect movie, nevertheless the perfect Spider-Man movie. It is a fan feast deluxe regarding one-liners and characters coming back. The story is interesting but a little bit over the top without any staggering excitement for longer than a few minutes. The story lays more on the emotions for Spider-Man as a person and I think that is both good and bad. Good, because the emotional ride gives the character better dept and understanding and I think that is done brilliantly. Bad, because you loose both tempo and excitement regarding the action and the story gets a little bit more \"messy\" when it comes to putting it all together. Another thing is the antagonist in form of many old bad guys coming back. I think it is a cool part but it is not enough for me when it comes to having a good antagonist because the guys coming back is 5/10 bad guys and not that interesting or terrifying. The storyline has to focus on first catching them and then heeling them and that is not that exciting as when fighting Thanos or other interesting bad guys. I think that the movie could need a better bad guy or someone that has better power and is a \"real\" threat rather than a dog on the \"loose\". If you have harder obstacles to overcome when it comes to defeating it the tempo and stakes gets higher and more interesting. In this case the multiverse collapse or persons coming from other dimensions can offcourse be devastating but it is too complicated when you have it in the mix with everything else so that part feels secondary. Therefore that thing is more something that is in the background. Or so it seems. Because dr strange has the solution ready and there is never a struggle for me as an audience to se how they will fix it and when they can't the solve it right away. It also feels that they are trying to make this movie so grandios and big that they forget that it was the smaller arena that many loved with the previous ones. Or maby that was just me. There are many characters coming back and that is really nice though sometimes you lose focus because of everyone's \"needed\" screen time. I am struggling in giving it 7/10 or 8/10. I think overall this movie only disappoints those who think this is a 10/10 movie.", "7.5 stars for the stories, 9.5 for nostalgia effect": "Simply the best Spiderman movie out there. But i can say, all of Spiderman MCU movies was strong because it supported by popular superhero characters that make it kinda unfair to compare it to past SONY non-MCU spiderman movies.Homecoming has Ironman, Far From Home got Nick Fury (and the hype after endgame).And no exception to No Way Home, except it Far more BIGGER support from so many popular characters.It has Dr. Strange. It has the original cast of villain from past spiderman and amazing spiderman movies.And even the past Spiderman actor was returning too.The movie is good, and the nostalgia effect make it better.But for a person who never watch all nonMCU spiderman movies, these movie is not that great, they dont care who the actor is because they simply didn't know them was on all past spiderman movies and how their stories told before.For example : Andrew spidey saving MJ is just ordinary superhero scene, but for Us (people who watched TASM2) that scene was nostalgic and we can felt the pain and sadness of Andrew SpideyFor me, No Way Home is the best movie on 2021 but After ZS Justice League.", "Everything you can ask for and more": "One of the best MCU movies, well written and well shot. Pacing could've been better it was finished before you know it, but that's just because I didn't want it to end.", "Ambitious, Exhilarating - Lives up to the Hype!": "Having the previous Spider-Man characters in the film was a guaranteed recipe for success. Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire entered the fray perfectly. Garfield stole the show in my opinion, but seeing the chemistry between him and Toby and then both of them with Holland was a childhood dream come true. Despite rumours floating around beforehand of their appearances in the movie, it was still an incredibly surprising moment when they actually appeared on screen. Audible gasps were heard in the cinema and despite knowing with some surety that it would happen, it was still a pleasant surprise.The amount of screen time Maguire and Garfield got felt just right. They were present enough to make an impact and provide us with the smiles, laughter and nostalgic familiarity that we wanted so much, but not so much as to overshadow Holland and to make us forget the fact that this in fact is a film where he is the main character.It was brilliant how the film was able to poke fun at itself by way of the three different Peter Parkers. They joked about how Maguire was the only one who didn't need a contraption to shoot webs and this semi-breaking of the fourth wall made the audience feel respected in that everyone was aware of the contradictions in the different visions of Spider-Man throughout the decades and how these differences were all together in the same room, united. Maguire, Garfield and Holland worked excellently together, and despite Maguire looking visibly older he was able to bring a presence of experience alongside his traditional goofiness to the table. Any scene with more than one Spider-Man was a pleasure to watch.Another aspect of the film that I was happy about was the notable step away from relying on the MCU. While the connection to the MCU can be a huge benefit to a superhero film, it can also act as somewhat of a crutch for weaker characters who cant stand on their own. In No Way Home, while the link to the wider MCU is both established and used via the help of Dr Strange (in fact he is an integral part), he feels like only a section of the movie and not part of its main storyline. At each step he is kept realistically occupied so that the problems throughout the film can be addressed without him and the wider MCU. This finally addressed what I found problematic in the earlier Tom Holland films and allowed the Spider-Man franchise to stand on its own eight feet for once.Although Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield were more or less supporting characters in this film, its clear that the script writers gave them enough respect and us enough fan-service to ensure that their characters developed beyond their original stories all these years later. For Garfield's Spider-Man this comes at a heart-stopping moment when during the final battle MJ falls off the scaffolding towards an untimely end. Tom Holland's Spider-Man makes a dash for her in an eerie echo to how Garfield's Spider-Man dove right after Gwen Stacey in his film. Sadly for Garfield's Spider-Man however, he was too late and he was unable to save Gwen as she hit the ground and died and it seems for a moment that this fate will again play out as Holland's Spider-Man is obstructed from saving MJ by the Green Goblin's glider. It is at this very moment that Garfield's Spider-Man swoops in with fire in his eyes to save MJ and do what he never did in his own universe. Prevent Spider-Man's love interest from death. We see his emotion flare up and with tears in his eyes we see him realise what he has accomplished. No doubt this provides his character with some much needed healing, and us with some much needed closure.For Maguire it came in the form of matured, heartfelt mentoring. Despite the closeness between Tony Stark and Peter Parker in this universe, the only one who could really understand how Holland's Peter Parker felt after the tragic death of his Aunt May was another Spider-Man who had also felt loss. Although Garfield's Spider-Man had felt this loss too, Maguire was able to provide a matured, healed and calming presence to Holland's Peter Parker to help him navigate his grief. Boy did he need it. Holland's Spider-Man was on a rampage during the final fight with the Green Goblin and for the first time we saw a brutal side of him that enjoyed causing pain to his enemies. It was unexpected but a reminder that without the guidance of those older and wiser than us, we are susceptible to fall into mistakes that can ruin us. Maguire was able to guide Holland away from such a path and towards one of compassion and mercy, emphasised by the theme of \"cure, not kill\", which meant that villains would be pacified and returned to their original, pre-supervillain state instead of killed. This guidance was profound and enabled Holland's Peter Parker to overcome his anger and transcend it, allowing him to become the hero his suit deserved. Maguire really shined here and we understood the effect that time, loss and sacrifice can have on a man.Ultimately, Tom Holland's Spider-Man was mentored at the time he needed it most, by the very people (essentially matured versions of himself) who were best suited to do so. He was able to realise that there were other who knew how he felt and who could show him a better path.I found it interesting to note that a criticism of Tom Holland's Peter Parker initially was that we didn't get to see him \"become\" Spider-Man. From the first time we saw him, he already was the friendly neighbourhood hero we are familiar with. We didn't even see him experience loss with the traditional death of his Uncle Ben sparking a quest of grief and self-discovery leading to his maturity into the Spider-Man we know. In 'No Way Home' however, we see this moment of loss occur when we least expect it. Holland's Peter Parker loses his Aunt May after the apartment they are in is attacked by the Green Goblin. Before she passes she is able to convey the famous words of wisdom which are destined to ring in the ears of every webbed superhero until the end of time, \"With great power comes great responsibility\". Seeing Holland's Peter Parker experience this loss in the 3rd film instead of the first was a twist I didn't see coming, but it showed that the script writers didn't forget about the original formula. While they didn't follow it to a tee, they still incorporated it into their vision. I can respect that. It also felt as though even though it happened in his third film, it may be a hint towards a new beginning for his character, one where he is self confident and sure in his identity and intentions.In order to save the world he knows from collapsing in on itself, Holland's Peter Parker has to make an agonising choice. The only way to fix things properly is to erase everyone's memory about him, to the extent that no one would know that he is Spider-Man anymore. His best friend and love interest, MJ would be living their lives as if they never knew who he was. Seeing that this is the only way forward, Holland's Spider-Man take the leap of faith and asks Dr Strange to make it happen. Its heart-breaking results are seen towards the end of the film when Holland goes to meet an MJ with no memories of Peter Parker as Spider-Man and tell her everything so they can get back together again. Noticing some minor injuries MJ sustained during the final battle previously, Parker pauses for introspection before deciding not to open up to her. By making such a painful decision, MJ is saved from entering a world where she is inherently at danger due to associating with Spider-Man at all. In previous films, Maguire and Garfield's Spider-Man have been able to make this decision consensually with their respective love interests, but this time it is only Peter Parker who knows. As he sees MJ and his former best friend Ned enjoy their time together as friends, he realises that he does better service to them by keeping them safe even if it means he loses their love and companionship. This is the ultimate sacrifice he makes for them, choosing to bear this pain alone as he allows them to live blissfully unaware of their previous life.Holland's Peter Parker was able to embody perfectly the meaning of the words echoing in his mind and the mind of all Spider-Men in all universes, \"With great power comes great responsibility\".This movie started off as the previous films did. It had a tint of childishness to it which meant I couldn't really take it seriously compared to previous entries in the franchise. But I realise now that 'No Way Home' served as a coming of age moment for Holland's Peter Parker. He has been able to shed his previous life and relationships through grief, loss and sacrifice while learning and being mentored by some of the greatest mentors any Peter Parker could have. I truly feel like his Spider-Man has matured through to the point that he is ready to stand on his own and give us the Peter Parker we have always expected. He delivered in this film and we saw him grow and mature to where his identity is set in stone. Although people may have historically taken issue with Holland's Spider-Man in that there was no origin story like the previous Spider-Man heroes had, in hindsight it feels like the entire trilogy of Holland films have led up to this moment and I am able to fully appreciate that now.The events of the film also signal a break away from the main MCU characters, as everyone would have lost their memory of Peter Parker and potentially have no idea how to contact a web-slinging superhero in New York. I don't expect his inclusion in wider, high profile MCU films for a while, and considering the direction this film has taken, I am OK with that. Tied in to the fact that his Aunt May has died and Parker has now finished High School and now going to College, separating from his old friends and life seems like a logical step forward.I look forward to his further adventures.", "Epic!": "This movie is epic! \u00c9pica!!

The story is bad and the fan service is the only thing holding this movie toguether. It's a shame that now is really hard for studios to create new things. Everything has to appeal nostalgia. Everyon lost their minds with green goblin. As a fan of raimis movies I get it. But the thing is the goblin was great 20 years ago. Wouldn't be great to have a new villain as iconic and awesome as Dafoe with the goblin? Another thing that really annoyed me was Tom's character. He's too naive. He's too dumb. He never thought about speaking to the mit people. He's just not relatable or worthy of admiration. This movie entertains but that's it.

Paise barbad now I think this is the end of Spiderman series.", "in parts great in parts unlogical": "The first part of the movie is in terms logic, the story was basically that peter wanted that his friends can go to college though he's Spider Man. He goes to Doctor Strange in order to everyone forgets he's Peter Parker. The spell goes wrong and villains of diffrent universes get into tom hollands universe. Now he has to catch them but doctor strange doesnt care whether they are caught or not. That's the part where it gets unlogical. He catches the villains so easy (in the previous movies they needed one movie for one villain) in this movie he catches every of them in 15 minutes. Then he fights with doctor strange about helping them he beats doctor strange in his OWN (self created) world. And now he sets all the villains free. And trys to help them with his new big scientific knowledge (as a teenager) it all wents wrong and May dies in a very woesome scene. The introduction of the 3 spider men was also so bad because of neds new wizzard thing he searches peter parker after he found two new spider men he didnt even asked wheather there is another new spieder men or opens again this wizzard thing to come to the real spider man. They have the hole time the thing to bring the villains back but they dont use it in order to make Mays death not useless. Now they're going to a SCHOOL CHEMISTRY ROOM to create a serum for each of the villains. The fights at the statue of Liberty were really impressive and flashbacking. At the total end doctor strange comes back and make all human on earth forget who peter parker is. MJ and Ned are going to college but forgot who peter was and on the grave on Aunt May he meets Happy again who also forgot who peter was. At the end I can say it was a good movie but totally not that good how it's rated on IMDb (at the moment i think 8.8) i would give the movie a good 7.2. I liked homecoming and far from home more but everyone has his own opinion.", "Spider Man: No Way Home - a film with many weaknesses that are balanced out by the emotional level - is a Marvel masterpiece and better than Avengers: Engame": "The third part of the MCU Spiderman has so many logic errors that it is almost scary, the first part is typical Marvel stuff with a lot of jokes, many of which in my opinion don't ignite.However, the second half of the film is just bombastic and deserves a 10/10: epic, funny, emotional.It is important to mention the strong cast, which is not really used in some places: Willem Defoe delivers a great performance, Alfred Molina is good too, but let's be honest: Sandmann and Lizard had next to nothing to do in this film , they were just there. The worst of the five villains, however, is Jamie Foxx (Electro), even if he has more screen time than Lizard and Sandman. The character we saw here was just not the same as in TASM 2. Electro just plays cool in this movie and that's just too cheap for me.Tom Holland is at his best, his relationship with Zendaya feels realistic for the first time, even if the character of Zendaya in this film is pissed off.ATTENTION SPOILERS:Andrew Garfield delivers a super strong performance and also the epic moment of the film. Tobey Maguire is doing well too, his Spider-Man films are the best (in my opinion), but in this film he is the most unremarkable of the three Spider-ManOverall rating: 8.5 / 10\nOn IMDB: 8/10.", "OMG THEY'VE ACTUALLY DONE IT!!": "They ACTUALLY got Tobey and Andrew to be in this movie ! I was kinda predicting that they will have them there but I was still happy they did it. It pays homage to the previous movies that they were in, the banter between the three spidyes is so fun !", "had an great experience": "With Peter Parker(Holland, owning the role) revealed to the world as Spider-Man, he and those closest to him have their lives ruined. He implores Dr Strange(Cumberbatch, compelling as always) to use his magic to help. And there is an attempt. But there are unintended consequences.", "The whole movie wouldve been solved with proper communication and smart decision making.": "I feel like most of the hype is because of this movie being a first of its kind but if we rate this movie on just the story and plot it tries to tell us, the rating would be very different.Although it was very fun seeing characters from previous franchises come back in this movie how we got there felt very forced and kinda dumb.Peter wants to change the fabric of reality to fix his life and lives of people around him which is although a drastic solution to his problem ill give it a pass, but strange knowing how delicate the spell is and how it would be effecting the mind of every person on earth decides not to have a 2 min conversation with peter to tell him exactly whats gonna happen but decides to do it while casting the spell was just a big dumb move on his part not to mention he blames peter afterwards for the screw up, really Strange ? Your lack of communication skills is what caused the mess not peter. I dont know why the fallout from Loki wasnt the driving force behind the start of this multiversal event, especially since this movie is one of the first ones to happen after the ending of Loki where we can see glimpses of the monumental consequences of that show with slight multiverse tears where the characters that appear in no way home slip through. I guess we'd need to explain why only spiderman characters are slipping through but im sure something could be made up, into the spiderverse had a more natural way of introducing these multiversal characters without making the main heroes look dumb and wreckless.And my second gripe with this movie is the dumb decision Peter makes by bringing 5 unstable superpowered villains from a bunker type of space to an appartement in a public building in the middle of the city to cure them, sure the idea of curing them and helping them seems flawed since some of them like doc oc are gonna die regardless and their are infinite versions of each one of these characters that die or live in other universes but i understand Peter wanting to help them since these are concrete people to him that hes met talked to and sympathised with, but him deciding to bring them to Happys apartement instead of taking that stark box to stranges lair to help them has got to be one of the dumbest decisions Peter couldve made.He chose to bring 5 volitile super powered unstable villains to an appartement where he had to keep an eye on all of them as they walk around the place with anything ready to set them off and have them run a muk in a place where not only his very none superpowered aunt lives but also other civilians in the building. He chose to do that, instead of just taking that stark tech to stranges bunker where each villain is imprisoned in their own cell where they can stay put no matter what sets them off and even if they manage to escape there would be wizards around like wong ready to get things under control should the worse happen. Im sorry Peter but that choice you made was the complete opposite of being responsible and aunt May dying is completely your fault as tragic as that might be. And dont tell me he couldnt move the stark tech because the fbi was looking for it i bet its so much easier moving that tech without anyone noticing than having to move 5 dangerous superpowered villains especially when one of them is a giant lizard that looks like a dinosaur. And strange didnt come back until the end of the movie so peter had all the time in the world to fix them without worrying he might be interrupted.Ned having magic is just a copout to force the plot to move along again as well, just outta nowhere Ned is able to do stuff that took Strange months of grueling training to accomplish.The ending also had that it was all a dream type of feel, it just felt that not only did it revert things to the status quo it reverted to even less than that, the ending of far from home was a pretty cool game changer for this franchise and having that massive plot shift get redconned by just having everyone forget it feels pretty cheap and a let down. And dont most of the avengers know who spiderman is ? Cant he just go back to Dr. Strange as spiderman then unmask and then tell him everything that happened ? I mean presumably the spell wont effect stranges trust in spiderman, he'll just forget who peter parker is and who is under the spiderman mask, but if spiderman tells him what happened and he tells him about the spell that caused it, just makes this whole spell feel very flimsy and can be easily broken i dont know. Its just bizarre that a movie with such an amazing premise can have such a forced and inconsistent plot that drags it down like it did.", "MCU Spider-Man Finally Hits the Mark": "I have to say that I have always been a fan of Holland's Spider-Man movies, but they never really stood out as anything special compared to Spiderman 2 or Into the Spider Verse. They always seemed to have low stakes or revolve more around Iron Man than I would have liked. This film however is worth every bit of the hype.We see Peter discover the true purpose of what it means to be Spider-Man. It was not impactful to see Peter screw up in Homecoming or Far From Home because the mistakes he made did not end up having dire consequences. In No Way Home, Peter's actions lead to irreversible outcomes that he is forced to live with. The movie does a fantastic job of showing how Peter chooses to react to the events that take place throughout the movie. He is no longer the funny and stupid high schooler that he is portrayed as in every movie leading up to this. This film feels like the end of a Spiderman origin story and it was an incredible experience.It was cool to see many characters from older films return as well. Many may argue that this simple fan service, but these characters all tied into the story beautifully. Sandman and lizard were kind of \"just there\" but it isn't like they took anything away from the film. The opening portion of the movie is a little slow, but there is a point where it does a complete 180 and pick up fast.Overall it is great to see the MCU finally hit its stride after a sub-par phase 4 movie lineup. The post credits are exciting as well and we will see what is next for Spider-Man.", "The movie of the decade!": "I loved this film so much! It was such an awesome and nostalgic experience for og fans! I think the writers and the director put a ton of work into this and made a visually spectacular film with no flaws! However the second half stands out more and is more fun and interesting,the first half is still pretty fun! I give the first half an 9/10 and the second a 10/10.It got pretty dark when the green goblin betrayed the heroes and killed aunt may! Green goblin was very frightening! I loved all the villains and all the fight scenes! Especially when we saw Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield! Very surprising film and for sure my favorite comic book film up there with the dark knight! Go watch it right now if you haven't!", "How to fool people with fan service or the majority of comic book movies": "Spoilers ahead. THIS IS MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION.I'm 24 years old. I have seen the first Spider-Man trilogy 5-6 times, the majority of them at home because back then cinema was not such a big thing for me or in my country. I have seen the second Spider-Man series 2-3 times, only at home. I have seen Into the Spider-Verse three times at the cinema, no regrets. Now to add to that, I have seen Dune, the new 2021 movie, three times at the cinema, no regrets. But let me tell you, I have seen this movie once, and, if I could, I would ask for my money back, and I won't touch it again either.I think it's pretty obvious that this new Spider-Man trilogy is made for children, but this third movie it's one of the most blatant cash grabs ever in my opinion, and that's about it, in terms of cinema speaking. 100% fan service, 0% movie. Just like the director Martin Scorsese said, amusement park films. Obviously, there are some exceptions from this rule, some examples would be the first Spider-Man trilogy, The Dark Knight trilogy, Infinity War, Into the Spider-Verse, The Joker etc.The movie starts right after the events of Far From Home, and the premise of the movie is that, because his friends don't get into MIT, this being a consequence of his identity being revealed, Peter Parker asks Dr Strange to cast a spell so that everybody in the world forgets that he is Spider-Man. So basically, if you don't get into MIT, it's the same as the end of the world so might as well try. Not only is he acting like a coward, but totally ignores the fact that his idol and former mentor, Tony Stark, revealed his identity publicly by his own accord, and, he has the Stark Industries at his feet. And after that, he acts like a two year old while Strange casts the spell and what do you know we have a new problem on our hands. Pretty dumb premise in my opinion just to try and do what Into the Spider-Verse already did way better, just with the addition of new villains from other universes.The story and how it plays out are dissapointing as well. Green Goblin, Dok Ock, Lizard and Electro are revived from the dead by some magic mechanic, then after all of them are captured, Peter Parker fights Doctor Strange because Strange wanted to send the villains back, but because almost all of them would die, he thinks that the act is not ethical and decides to stop him so that he could try and cure them. I can understand that, if they are a different person from the one that died in their respective universe, they could live, but it's just really cringe. And he takes them TO HIS HOUSE, WHERE HE HAS STARK EQUIPMENT. Like, you literally just fought an enemy who deceived you (Mysterio) and after that you do this. I don't understand how they could show him as a maths and physics genius, but keep him so immature and dumb. It's not like he just became Spider-Man yesterday like Miles Morales did in Into the Spider-Verse, he literally says himself in the movie that he fought aliens both on Earth and in space. It's midway through his third movie and he has learnt nothing. I refuse to believe that after the first movie, with Tony's help, and between the moment they beat Thanos and starts fighting Mysterio, he does absolutely 0 contemplation and meditation about what is happening to him and the severity of those things. It's just plain stupid and ilogical. Not to mention that he needed TWO ORIGIN STORIES to become \"mature\", the death of Tony Stark not being enough apparently. I felt that May's death was just a cringe adaptation of Uncle Ben's death and unnecessary.Moving on, the movie doesn't know how to keep any momentum, it just destroys any tension by trying to be funny, but ultimately being very very cringe. The way they introduced Tobey and Andrew was very cringe and devoid of any imagination. The last fight and the way it played out was very underwhelming, there was nothing special about it, the way they sequenced the actions in the fight was really lame and unimaginative (I don't know for what reason they waited so long for Goblin to show up at the statue, I'm sure they could have set up the final Peter-Goblin fight even if he showed up early), nothing that would evoque the awesomeness of having THREE SPIDER-MEN and FIVE SPIDER-MAN VILLAINS there; lots of cringe moments of discussing what is means or how it is to be Spider-Man and meeting an old acquaintance, \"emotional\" moments and subpar callback comedy. The action is too scarce and unimpressive. It could have been an amazing armageddon if the true potentials of the villains and the three Spider-men were used to the fullest. They failed to show the fighting and decision making experience of Tobey's and Andrew's Spider-Men, given that they were both already doing this for at least two years. The fight between Parker and Strange was the only part that I liked in the movie, but they severely nerfed Strange just for the purpose of the story.The script is horrible. The dialogue is extremely cringe. Comedy is almost absent in this movie, with a lot of forced jokes. Only Jamie Foxx manages to squeeze some good jokes in this awful script. Zendaya's MJ is one of the cringiest characters I have seen in a movie. The Peter-MJ relationship is very obnoxious, just lots of generic relationship moments that are common and you got tired of in mediocre romance movies. The relationship between the three Parkers is disappointing, characterized by very bland predictable jokes and bad callback interactions from previous movie scenes, almost ruining the original scenes. It was nice to see how they helped Holland's Peter to become more mature. Even though you may think Stark and Strange would be enough. I think they missed a lot of potential for this relationship. Not only did they miss a lot of potential for this relationship, Into the Spider-Verse did the same thing they were trying to do way better and without effort. Also, the relationship between Strange and Parker goes from hot to cold like nothing, especially towards the end, it makes Strange look like a complete tool and not like he is the Sorcerer Supreme and a person who went trough full medical training and a good portion of his career, being revered for his medical skills and brain capacity.Cinematography is bland, there are very few eye catching shots, apart from the Strange-Parker fight. The movie is too long, they could've added more fighting and still be enough time for contemplation, realisation, emotional moments and so on. A big problem I have with this new trilogy, although it's not such a big thing, is the fact that it has no beautiful swinging scenes. There were some incredible scenes in the previous Spider-Man interpretations, they showed you the beauty of Spider-Man and how majestic he is, it filled you with a sentiment of freedom and awe. The score is the generic action movie score, almost nonexistent, you barely notice it. The only two parts of it that I liked were the ones when Electro first appeared and they used his original melody from TASM2 and towards the finale when the played a cover of the theme song from the first trilogy, so about a maximum of one minute.In conclusion, the movie doesn't have it's own identity, it relies heavily on the previous interpretations of Spider-Man, but sadly not respecting their legacy (not that the second interpretation had a lot of legacy, but it has its good parts) and just using them as a mean of attracting people to go to the cinema so they could make money off them. It's a shame that Disney and Marvel will get all the money and praise for a movie that is devoid of imagination and badly executed, just because of fan service, instead of the girls and boys who participated in the making of the wonderful and groundbreaking Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, who did what Far From Home wanted to do 100x better, for which people actually worked for and used their heads to make a good piece of cinema that would please the fans too.", "cool": "Really cool movie with action scenes and good dialogue. As a film major I find this movie cool and it deserves to be at the top 10 on IMDb I hope a dc movie becomes on the top 10 as well like the batman or superman. Anyways great movie to see with your kids and loved ones. Really cool movie \ud83d\ude0e", "ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL": "Tom Holland delivers his best performance as the famous web-slinger yet. Tremendously conveys a variety of emotions to create such a huge imoact on the audience.There is no doubt that this is the most ambitious, exhilarating Spider-man film to date. This exceeded all expectations and had the whole audience on the edge of their seats. Jon Watts really outdid himself at directing the film.Spider-man Now way Home is perfectly balanced with action, drama, humour and emotion with almost no dull momentsWillem Defoe's return as the infamous green goblin is phenomenal! His facial expressions really show how talented he is at playing this iconic villain.This is without a doubt the best Spider-man film to date and perhaps just as good, if not better, than Avengers endgame.", "Call me crazy, but not a fan.": "Everything was forced. Jokes were bad, story was bad, Ned and MJ had more screen time than Spider-man. The whole premise of the movie was Peter wanted to change time so his friends could get Into MIT?? Sherlock Holmes would of never make that happen..Apparently Audible and Marvel twisted his arm....", "Plot, character, actors, graphics, action": "Spider-Man is one of my favorite superheroes, so I still found time to get out to the cinema.According to the plot, Parker's life became complicated after the disclosure of the secret of his identity. Someone considers him a hero, and someone is almost the most important villain. This harms not only Peter, but also his loved ones. To fix everything, he decided to resort to the help of a famous magician...The plot is, in principle, not bad and interesting, but logically it is not worth analyzing, there will immediately be a bunch of illogical places and moments. But this is the problem of many Marvel movies. On the other hand, with the simplicity of the plot, the film is quite fascinating, despite the fact that it runs for almost two and a half hours. This time is practically not felt, i.e. I left the cinema and realized from the surrounding environment (the number of people in the shopping center, the change in daylight) that a lot of time had passed, but I did not feel it in the hall.Of course, I won't say that the film is so exciting that you watch it \"in one breath\", no it's not. There are a lot of non-dynamic moments in it, to.", "It's a best marvel movie I saw in my life": "It's a best movie!! FG or not but I will be working in the morning and then I can get it to India \ud83d\ude02 India for the world to India for better treatment and I will be there.", "A nostalgia trip for the ages": "The movie is an enjoyable, Marvel/Disney formula, spectacle that delves deeply into the nostalgia train through the use of the Multiverse. While the movie is enjoyable, it lacks the punch that FFH offered instead relying solely on the return of previous cast members Maguire, Garfield, Dafoe, Molina and Foxx to pull the film through. Defoe put on an absolute masterclass and it was a welcome sight to see both Maguire and Garfield don the suits again but it leaves one thinking that would the film have been as good if these were replaced by different actors? It remains to be seen, however NWH provides another exciting entry into the Marvel universe and gives me high hopes for the multiverse going forward.", "The most overrated movie I've ever seen": "The creators play with concepts they do not even understand properly. The scenes look like kids playing a show in kindergarten. Most of the bad guys are doctors and professors who were not able to deal with their issues, and a teenager and his similar friends make an antidote for each of them in a couple minutes. Not a single breaking moment, the main characters are not able to make a call to any emotions. Couldn't feel the link to the other Spider Man movies, the same actors, not the same characters. Overall a good movie to fall asleep to, preferably in the first 10 minutes.", "Gigantic Task, Enormous Repercussions": "The world really has not been the same since Thanos' snap, and the revelation of the identity of Spiderman as Peter Parker (played by Holland). I went into this film with enormous expectations, and a more than generous glimpse of what was in store, thanks to the trailers that preceded the film, so there's a rough idea of what to expect.This Peter is more at conflict than ever. You would expect that a character that has been through so much, with so many other superheroes, would at least appreciate the consequences of his actions. But he fails, spectacularly, setting of a chain of events that oscillate between the familiar scenarios, to the not so familiar. While friends and foes may appear parallel, new means, choices and measures must be taken to both adapt to a new world order, as well as mitigate what, to the credit of the showrunners, feels like colossal and universal stakes.At the end, I felt some level of shortness of satisfaction, but there is redemption and hope with what comes at the tail end. Still, well done Marvel Studios!", "Good movie but.....": "I liked this movie. Not as good as Infinity War or the first Avengers movie but the best Spider Man movie to date. Introducing the other characters from all the Spider-Man movies into one, including the other Spider-Mans, was a great idea. Something every generation fans love. The only criticism I have for this movie was the jokes seemed forced and not as funny and the drama scenes took waaaaay too long. Tobey Maguire walking into the scene, I had people literally clapping. Why? I may be that person when the Flash movie comes out and Michael Keatons Batman shows up. But that's for another time. In conclusion, good MCU, top 5 for sure and it's a must watch.", "It was insanely brilliant.": "Has it all, a MASTERPIECE of Marvel. This is a movie to watch at the Cinema....

Sure the plot was a bit weak and there was some plotarmor in the film (although it don't bother me in way that made me dislike the film). But the respect and genuine hommage to the previous spiderman films was so refreshing. I resent the ubiquitous use of the Disney-formula, the way that a lot of movies and series feel like something made on an assembly line, where all bad things are polished out. But in my opinion, this film tried to keep its predecessors as they were, and it felt genuine. There was real emotion in this film, the pains and hurts of previous Spiderman iterations were not polished away. No, they were there and they were redeemed in a way that I found moving and believable. And there are true consequences of actions in this film. Consequences that that feel and are real within the world Spider man. That is again a break with the formulic way that a lot movies seem to deal with their characters and stories. So it is not a perfect movie, but it is so close. The movie connected with me and I really enjoyed the watch.", "CGI and storyline are okay, lame action though": "Apart from the scene with doctor Strange I found the action a bit lame, over the top, not.surprising.But some of the acting is great, the storyline is decent, close up scenes ar ethe best part of it, actually.Hated the CGI when sliding in the snow, please do not use that when it looks so wonky.", "Not as i was hoping for": "To be honest, movie was ok!

Tom, Andrew and Tobey worked perfectly together and it was so nice to see Andrew with a proper script behind him. They were hilarious together, the script was superb and it was emotional, funny, gripping and action packed.All the throw backs made the film even better, the classic villain outfits and quips, the dialogue, the spidey suits, the music. The cinematography was beautiful too, when Spidey is swinging through the woods to find electro, when he's standing in the rain watching the screen in the side of the building, when him and Strange are in the mirror dimensions.Everything worked so well, and if you grew up watching the original Spider-Man films it's so good to see the other Spideys back. There's also a reference to Miles when electro says \"there must be a black Spider-Man out there\" this sets up for the next film to involve Miles Morales!The end credits with Venom is great too, as now the symbiote.is in the MCU, this sets up for when Tom Holland spidey gets the symbiote which takes over, that's when Miles will have to kick some ass and prove himself worthy as he will eventually take the lime light from Peter Parker.All in all this film is perfect in every single way. I don't think Marvel would ever top this. I can't wait to see what they do next.", "Handled very well": "Couldn't have been better. Spoiler alert....

JUST..... WOW!!!!!!": "Unlike the rest of the world, I wasn't overly excited about this movie. I thought it would be another fun MCU movie, nothing more, nothing less. And I could not have been more wrong.This movie has the typical MCU tropes in it, the witty banter/ humor, but at a certain point it surpasses anything the MCU has done before. Whereas the action and fight scenes in previous movies like Endgame and Infinity War were big and fun to watch, there are fight scenes in here that feel brutal, violent and almost hard to watch, particularly the very final fight of the movie.It also has the most emotion and heart of the MCU. There were times where I was sobbing, sometimes from something sweet, other times something tragic. The film perfectly balanced the light hearted and fun tone you come to expect from a MCU superhero film with the harsher and more brutal realities that come with being someone like Spider-Man. There are story beats in here, again without getting into specifics, that no MCU movie or really any superhero movie in general has had the guts to tackle, and this film tackles them with confidence and maturity. Don't get the wrong impression though, the movies not all doom and gloom. It's still very funny, very hearfelt, and at times adorable whenever the focus of the movie is on the relationship between MJ and Peter, who have off the charts chemistry.All of the performances here are top notch. The returning cast from the other MCU are all great, the cast from the other franchises are all great, the standout of them being Willem Dafoe who balances crazy, tragic and legitimately terrifying perfectly. But my God, Tom Holland shines brighter here than I have ever seen him shine, MCU movie or not. I've always loved him as Spider-Man and as an actor in general, and I was still blown away and just how good he was in this movie. He left me speechless so many times in this movie and I can safely say that he is the best Spider-Man we have ever seen here.And what this film gets right the most is the character of Peter Parker. I won't get into how that is as it alludes to spoilers, but the way he interacts with people and the choices he makes at points feels like the character from the comics. In this movie, he is the living embodiment of \"With great power comes great responsibility\" and I can't praise the writers and the director enough for truly nailing every aspect to Peter's character.In summary, I was expecting a fun, light hearted nostalgia fest and what I got instead was a deep, intense, and powerful character driven film with amazing performances and a gripping, thought provoking story. This is, in my humble opinion, the best Tom Holland Spider-Man movie, it's the best Spider-Man movie in general and it's the best MCU movie. It surprised me in every sense of the word and after it was done I couldn't believe how much I loved it. This is hands down my favorite movie of the year and I cannot recommend it enough, even though I'm sure you were all going to see it anyways. If you weren't though, I'd you for some reason were still on the fence about it for some reason, don't be. It's everything you want it to be an so much more.10/10.", "No Way Film": "A film that combines three different generations, a master of work, I'm still emotionated after 3 hours.

You can clearly see that he is the best Peter Parker/Spider-Man that we have ever had.", "best marvel film they have made": "21 years in the making..\nbest marvel / spiderman film yet..\nsimply awesome .. all cast did really well must have cost a fortune to get them all together.Paced very well.. music was great\n10/10.", "A worthy successor": "It captures the spirit of spider man, it is a fun popcorn flick to enjoy. There are some cool action sequences and the cast is top notch but at times it gives too much fan service.", "Holy Crap dude": "So this is a super Biased review so take that into effect. This movie is amazing the pacing flows so well 2 hours past in an instant. I grew up in the Fox Kids era, and if you know what that is or you were one too gonna love No Way Home. After the boring ass Eternals and lack luster Black widow Marvel is finally doing what fans wanted letting Spiderman do Spiderman stuff. Now that being said i will say i am bummed there is only 5 villain's and not a sinister six but I'm splitting ant hairs at that.", "An absolutely stunning movie non stop": "This is with no doubt one of the best marvel movies and probably the best spider man home trilogy, it's full of action, fun moments and great story non stop, even with the movie runtime length it was really worth it with everything happening. The level of the movie didn't go down and just kept me attracted and wanting more. Also it's very emotional you'll need a lot of tissuesThe negative thing about it was some dialogues and lines being too cringe, silly and unnecessary. With so many characters in the movie, some of them was weaker than others, didn't get a proper attention.", "This Spider-Man is Everything We Wanted it to be": "I cried 12 times I was so happy.

It delivers in every aspect.", "Must see, blew my expectations!": "I was expecting another heartless Marvel film, but Spider-Man was so much more again. Once more a Spider-Man movie made the audience laugh and gasp and clap and cry just so many times in the theater.Please go see this in a movie theater. It definitely doesn't require too much knowledge of the Marvel universe to understand this. It's just such a heartful and funny movie.", "It was the best movie I ever saw": "Tom Holland took you in made you feel every part of the movie made you feel so sad and also so hopeful. Tom Holland is a great actor! Zendaya, beautiful performance you made my heart skip a beat for al the love you gave you character. Great performance! How they include the previous Spider-Man movies was amazing! The movie took me in and made me ride along on this adventure. I honestly can't say anything bad about this movie!Everyone who worked on this movie, you guys did amazing!", "Met all expectations": "Met all expectations, Everything that I hoped for and could hope for, plus things that I didn't even know I needed and wanted. This movie has it all does it all and I can't wait for more!", "How can people even like this movie": "Couldn't take this movie seriously for one second. They try to hard to make the movie funny and serious at the same time but they fail totally on everything. My girlfriend felt asleep and i just sat there and was waiting for the movie to end. First spiderman movie was a real movie with real feelings involved.", "Really solid movie": "Huge Spider-Man fan and had really high expectations for this movie. Got exactly what I wanted and enjoyed both the action and emotion this film brought. Only gripe with the story was how Ned was able to use portal magic with absolutely no practice at all. Great movie great time.", "Incredible closure of the trilogy of Tom Holland as Spider-Man.": "Spider-Man No Way Home puts us immediately after what happened in Far From Home (2019) where Mystery revealed the identity of Spider-Man, from that moment Peter Parker turned from an acclaimed hero to an outcast of society, He has been arrested and constantly stalked in his normal life, that is why he goes for help to Dr Strange so that they forget his secret identity, but something goes wrong and they alter the stability of space-time entering the multiverse.Spider-Man No Way Home was released in Mexico this December 15, 2021 and almost immediately it was inevitable to be bombarded by one of the many spoilers that are on the internet, to begin with, Yes!, All the leaks that were appearing for months Before the premiere of No Way Home THEY ARE TRUE, all of them! I will avoid spoilers as much as I can, although it is difficult since they are the amalgamation of the story, a story that closes in an incredible way the trilogy of Tom Holland as Spider-Man.The movie gives us a simple story Spider-man goes to Dr Strange and the spell goes wrong, suddenly villains appear who know the identity of Spider-man due to the multiverse, we start with one of the strongest Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) giving the first of several action scenes that I personally feel are very well done; As for the performances in general they are good, the ones that stand out the most are Tom Holland, Benedict Cumberbatch, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx but the best in my opinion is Willem Dafoe with his excellent Green Goblin.This film offers what is expected is full of fan service, there are many references to previous Spiderman movies by the villains commenting on how they met or how they died and of course the 3 Spiderman when they are talking to each other about who they are. People who have lost or the villains they have faced, the director Jon Watts knew how to carry this story with its more than two hours duration transporting us through different emotions, anguish, exciting moments, funny and moving moments until we reach the happy ending.If you have reached this point in the review you will know that the \"Spiderverse\" was achieved by bringing Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire to the MCU and honestly it is not a spoiler because the information and images saturated social networks since December 15, in My personal favorite Spider-Man in this film was Tobey Maguire, for you which was the best?At the end of the film we have two post credits scenes, the first is linked to Venom 2 giving continuity to the post credits scene that we observe in his film and the second scene prepares us a bit for what will come in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness , Do not miss it.Rating: 9.0.", "NOSTALGIC. CHILLING. THRILLING.": "As you well know, Spiderman-Man is unmasked, which carries serious consequences that will get worse when he asks Dr. Strange for help.Starting with the fact that I am not a fan of Marvel, rather I am critical of his copypaste in most scripts, I have to admit that I had never felt this feeling in a movie theater. The atmosphere generated by being in a room full of fans of a movie with ovations, applause, cries and even shouts, is worth living and admiring for what they have achieved.The best without any doubt of the Jon Watts trilogy, where the quality leap in terms of direction is impressive. Coming from two films more focused on comedy than epic, it manages to amaze you with great battles. And thank God it does not depend only on this epicity, but also, there is a great drama that gets you excited.Tom Holland's arc is surprising, leaving behind the more adolescent and immature side of him. And one of the best in the movie ... the connection between him and Zendaya is really timely, conveying feelings that could not be created with two other actors.All this aside, the film may be made by and for nostalgia (much like \"Ghostbusters: Beyond\"), although I doubt it essentially depends on it. A fascinating use of special effects, thanks in large part to the appearance of Dr. Strange.Recommended in all aspects, with a proposal much more daring than the rest of Marvel films and that surely does not disappoint neither the fans nor those of us who do not like this universe. An event in the world of cinema, difficult to achieve.9.1/10.", "Not bad but some minor issues": "Not bad, The Green Goblin is perfect and the callbacks from the past Spider Man movies are funny. Though I think the buildup to Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maigure is a bit wasted but still is not bad.", "25/10": "If i could give this movie more i would! This movie is one of the best films i have seen in a very long time. The cinematic masterpiece has all aspects of a great action movie along with a phenomenal story line. SPOILER ALERT // seeing all 3 spider-man's and all villains in the multiverse really tied this together for me. Tom Hollands acting was as usual, exquisite. During this film I had all sorts of emotions and it sent me into a spiral of happiness along with a great deal of sadness. This has to be one of my favourite films it's just perfect.", "Loved every second of it": "I am going to remember 2021 happily because of this movie .

Do not see any spoilers just go blindly enjoy what I call pure happiness.", "Big surprise!!!": "Didn't expect the entry of characters from previous movies especially...you know!!!. It's a really amazing and good movie. Action and CGI effects are very good. Tom Holland was very good in the movie. And story.... It's superhero movie.. Forget about it...

Just go for it blindfolded; it is an absolute win for your money.Just a suggestion that wait for the TWO brilliant mid and post credit scenes. One of the best Marvel movie a100%.", "Best Marvel movie ever": "This is just a next level spider man movie. As a spider man fan growing up, this movie just blows my mind. There was not a single moment that i felt bored during the 2 and half hours. There were many times of applause around the theater. I love all the thing about it, this multiverse plan is just fantastic and I'm really looking forward to all the new stuff coming out from Marvel in the future.I will rewatch it may times.", "The most \"Spider-Man movie\" that has come out.": "Coming into the cinema, I was a little worried with how this movie was going to turn out, especially with the amount of pressure and hype built up by the trailers. On top of this, I was wondering whether the movie would take a more light hearted route similar to the likes of its previous two movies in the trilogy.However, from start to finish, \"Spider-Man No Way Home\" proves that it can keep portions of its light hearted nature and expand upon it to flesh out Tom's iteration of the \"web-slinger\". Presenting gut wrenching moments and plenty of emotions, all of which tie to a Spider-Man many comic book readers will be more familiar with. To finish, they really weren't joking when they said that \"Spider-Man No Way Home\" really is a love letter to the character and three generations of cinema, adding further meaning to the previous two films in this coming of age trilogy.", "The best spider man movie ever!! And top 3 MCU easily": "Omg I don't even know from where should I start talking... It's really a one of a kind movie, a masterpiece that will never come like it, it's a gift for every fan of marvel in general and of spider man specifically, everything was excellent: the story, the script, the acting, the directing, the visual effects, the score, the cinematography and the ending... The feelings I had watching the film can't be described and the audience reactions were epic, there's so many surprises that will leave you jaw-dropping and shocked, and the story and the idea of the multiverse couldn't be better, this is the biggest movie of the year, actually since endgame, this is the exact example of a movie made with love and honesty, Tom Holland gave us the best performance of him and every actor in the film was incredible and amazing, it's literally the best movie theater experience of my entire life, if you haven't watched it yet go see it on the biggest screen you'll have it's really worth it and worth all the wait, it's a tribute of 20 years of spider man movies.", "Unoriginal Nothing New!!!!!!": "Spiderman is one of my favourite Marvel Comics. This movies is a ripoff of Spiderman 3. (Tobey Maguire) Why ?Spiderman has so many Villains. Yet they use the same 10 Villains in all the Movies. I also thought the Movie was to Long. The only good thing I can say is that, Tom Holland is as close to the kid who plays Spiderman.", "Omg ! What a Movie": "This is definitely the best spider man movie without a doubt , but the surprising that it's better than endgame in my opinion\nThe whole Movie just deserves being Rated 10.", "Cinematic masterpiece & nostalgia - go watch if you haven't already!": "Safe to say I enjoyed this movie more than the endgame. Can't wait for the sequel. Tom Holland & Zendaya absolutely killed it. I can't express how much I thoroughly enjoyed this!", "Lacking in Quality, but Entertaining": "Spider-Man: No Way Home tried everything it could to appeal to the lowest common denominator in potential Spider-Man fans. Witty banter, callbacks to the Sam Raimi trilogy and the Amazing Spider-Man films, the list goes on and on. But the characters developed by the MCU for this Spider-Man franchise end up woefully lacking in any sense of depth or character as a result.If you take a look at Tom Holland's Spider-Man, and the acting is great of course, the writing of his character falls into complete disarray when you attempt to understand any of his actions. Especially when you compare this portrayal to the comic version, you begin to see that this version of the character doesn't seem to actually embody any of the traits that the character relies on in order to actually connect with them emotionally. \"With great power comes great responsibility\" is the hallmark of classic Spider-Man, and you see that even in the MCU-resurrected versions of Tobey and Andrew's respective portrayals of the character. However, Tom Holland's portrayal doesn't ever actually come to the point where his inaction with his power (which is the entire crux of the saying \"with great power comes great responsibility\") causes harm to anyone around him. Instead, it's great misuse of power that ends up hurting those he cares for.Spider-Man's entire persona relies on the idea that, \"If I don't use my power to help others, then the next person that dies could be someone like Uncle Ben.\" Tom Holland's Spider-Man never learns this lesson, and after 3 films, still fails to understand this basic foundation of the character.There is the argument, of course, that this portrayal doesn't have to be \"accurate\" to the character's already established motivations and character traits. To this, I would say that you're entirely correct. But then, why would you bother attributing this jumbled up mess of character defects of a Spider-Man to the Peter Parker version? That character already exists, why would you not just create a new character if you intended on changing something so incredibly fundamental to how that character operates within a story?Overall, I just think that this entire MCU Spider-Man franchise is a complete flop, story-wise. There is no real connective tissue throughout the three films, none of the main cast gets any development or even a casual step into any actual character depth, and the most recent film is lacking in even plot coherency.When the only good parts of your film are the scenes where characters from better films are making cameos, then you can safely assume that your film is sorely lacking in any actual substance of its own.", "Top 3 of the entire MCU franchise for sure": "If Marvel has shown us something in the last few years is that, when they create too much hype for a movie, they deliver and never disappoint us. The only wrong thing about this movie is the scene where the problem is created. Of course Peter has every reason to go and ask Dr. Strange for help, but the very scene where the spell goes wrong felt very forced and just stupid.Once we left this problem behind, the movie is superb. The fan service is incredible while at the same time delivering it in an incredible way. The appearence of Tobey and Andrew is extremely pleasent while at the same time being very important in Tom Holland's Peter Parker arc. Every scene between the 3 of them is just a love letter to every Spiderman fan!! (including me). Tom Holland gives such an emotional perfomance, he proves everyone saying he's not a great Peter Parker was wrong. Willem Dafoe is just amazing, he steals the show with his crazy perfomance and confirms himselfs as the best villain of the entire Spiderman franchise. Honorable mentions to Zendaya and Alfred Molina perfomances and of course, the bittersweet final is just incredible. I was totally hyped by this movie and i can happily say it exceeded my expectations on every level. Not even Scorcese could hate this movie.", "\ud83e\udd14": "Good movie, but at times felt this movie's tone was off.Why would DR Strange alter reality, just because Peter Parker and his friends had a tough time with getting into college and couldn't handle the reality of being a superhero....Why would Peter Parker want to save the previous villains, only to have them sent back to their universe and die....the whole movie was about Spidey trying to help/save the villains. Poor and unimaginative writing.", "A great movie that you need to watch": "Very funny and very emotional ,l. The comedy in this film is very funny, but we all knew that from the earlier movies as well.I Definitely recommend this movie if you are a fan of good movies, and the marvel universe, very good action scene to the end. The movie has a good story with tons of emotions and heart.10/10 Great.", "The best experience (maybe the best movie) in the year": "I am really speechless, the fact that I needed basically 3 days to write this review.This movie finally made many things that we really wanted (besides of Tobey and Andrew) : a redemption for Andrew Garfiled's spider-man especially with saving MJ, and finally the something missing in all of spider-mans movies: the consequences of the behaviors of peter (in that case is Tom Holland's).The original Peter wanted to live 2 lifes while he can't do that, but he insist which caused the big problem that he must deal with it. He didn't learn his fault and still do anything he want and still causes other problems until he saw the worst thing that can happen, Aunt may dies in front of him. He just realize that he must choose between two things : being spider-man and lose your private life , or live your normal life and let your gifts goes just like that.The movie is really beatiful many cameos and memes, just a plot hole about the villains; in the movie doctor strange said that all people who knows the identity of peter parker will come to tom holland' verse.Well electro and venom don't know who is spider-man's real identity, so it's a little plote hole.I recomand people to see the movie ( obvisiouly after watching all spider man movies and the MCU for better experience).", "The Best Spiderman Movie, Ever!": "Don't read reviews, if you're a Spidey fan, just\ngo watch it ASAP! From emotions, to actions, to screenplay, to music, all are perfect. Just try to avoid spoilers in the internet.", "The Best Spider-Man to Date": "Prior to watching this in theatres, expectations were high (at least mine were) and not only were they met, but exceeded. If you are a fan of the current and previous Spider-Man franchises, this movie is filled with several nastalgic moments. On the other hand, the movie also provides enough context and direction to appeal to those who don't consider themselves fans and/or don't have much knowledge of the previous films.", "They stuck the landing": "There was a lot going on in this movie. A lot. It works have been easy to let something get away or lose plot or emotional impact. But they nailed it.

Most importantly be prepared to expect the unexpected!!", "middle movie.": "\"Spider-man: no way home\" was a decent movie. Most are blinded by the nostalgia it contains. But it's SO unneeded, doctor strange wouldn't EVER do such spell. The Unnecessary dialogue they needed to take up space, the death was not heartfelt cause they turned may into this sexy aunt you really couldn't feel peters emotions. It was predictable, the showing of Andrew, Tobey had to be the WORST. Their conflict was SO dry. They should've just met up facing the villains making funny jokes, bringing them closer. Though I'm not huge fan of marvel movies cause they are un-logical, the tic the got me mad was when everyone forgot Peter. Ruined his and everyone's ENTIRE \"character development\" it revolves around peter, peter is the main character. HE IS THE CORE.", "Maybe the Best Spider-Man Movie": "Spider-Man 2 and Spiderverse are fantastic movies but between them and No Way Home, I can't decide which is better. NWH has fanservice but it does it really well and it's still got a compelling story about heroism and selflessness with great characters at the same time.", "What did I just witness!?": "This movie was FANTASTIC! Personally I enjoy Marvel Entertainment Studios' movies but I'm no super-fan. I expected to be one anticipated by fans and only enjoyed by them. I expected this movie to be another one of the movies that shows everything good in the trailers but the rest of the movie would be horrid! But I was wrong. I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning to end. The introduction of the film and each villain,Cameo,and main character were all well done and each sacrifice and bit of failure in this movie was perfectly done! They made you feel sad and really made you understand the pain it takes to become a superhero. I laughed at the chemistry between characters because it's one that will put a smile on your face. I found nothing in this film to be rushed, and it was taken at the PERFECT pace. You wouldn't get bored and you would have enough time to comprehend the plot twists. I found little to no flaws with this movie, and I recommend it to any marvel fan or marvel to come. This movie is one of them that should get you into liking marvel movies if you don't already (I recommend watching the previous two first). My final bit of information is to see this movie with others because the emotions MUST be shared with those close to you. Stay safe. :)", "Spider-Man No Way Home review": "Most insane movie ever, sony marvel and the cast did an absolute amazing job on this movie. I'll have to watch it again to wrap my head around it.

Apart from that Electro killed it, although I do like the blue version from TASM2 more. Sandman killed it especially that scene where he saw Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man, Alfred Molina was just amazing like really really good, and I wish we would've seen more of the Lizard but he was already a great villain in TASM1, I understand though as he was a side villain along with Sandman. This film truly makes the other MCU Spider-Man films make more sense and make the MCU's Spider-Man seem like an actual Spider-Man rather than a side-kick Iron Boy Jr. There is so much more to talk about but I'm just going to leave it here. Overall my favorite movie of all time and my favorite MCU movie.", "Iran": "The cartoon of the heroes was very well received by the people because it is really a beautiful cartoonIt is favored by Iranians and other countries\nBut you removed it from the poll and that's not fairThe power of the Iranian people's cyberspace is very high, so turn it aroundThis animation is supported by popular opinions.", "I'm sorry but I just don't get it...": "How is this getting such great reviews?

It's hard to explain but it feels like all the actors met each other 5 minutes before the cameras started rolling. There is zero chemistry, it feels so unnatural and forced and awkward. As expected the special effects are very good, but that's honestly the only redeeming quality I can think of and nowhere near enough to save this thing.

This Spider-man series actually just a fans service. Many kids and teenagers will like it just like my sons. I think the script writer and director just need to make a story that can bring so many villains and other Spider-men to join into this movie. This is kinda good,but how to make them join and Dr Strange influences in this are really forced and kinda stupid actually. How can Dr Strange can be fooled so easily by Spider-man in his territory. Yeah I know..this is just a teenager movie. Whatever...everything looked so weird..the Spider-man, May, Ned, MJ...they are not connected emotionally.

And the character development of every person of the movie is just awesome.there are more surprises in this movie you jast have to watch and decide it yourself.", "what a movie": "With Peter Parker(Holland, owning the role) revealed to the world as Spider-Man, he and those closest to him have their lives ruined. He implores Dr Strange(Cumberbatch, compelling as always) to use his magic to help. And there is an attempt. But there are unintended consequences.If you're not interested in reading an extremely positive review of this, turn back now. I can't believe they actually did it. There's no way(eh?) that this should work. It should end up overstuffed, like Raimi's third entry did. Somehow, the fan service and nostalgia-bait does not overwhelm, and this has a real heart to it. The references are plentiful without ending up obnoxious.", "PERFECT IT WAS LIKE A FANFICTION": "Everything that I wanted to happen in this movie happened w the beginning to even the end credit scenes!!! A movie u have to watch in theatres the experience is awesome.", "Super messy, but glad I watched in movie theater": "If I would have watched this on my phone or alone, I definitely wouldn't have enjoyed it that much. Other than that a really entertaining film and a nice addition to the MCU, but in speaking honestly, MCU has been off since end of the Infinity Saga.", "Slightly dissapointed, but still there are some good points": "So obviously, we'd be expecting the 3 generation of sipderman coming up and the same time and of course it did happen. So that is the part that excited me the most. Very very excited and happy to see Toby and Andrew being on the same stage with Tom. Some funny interactions indeed, like the \"back\" from Toby. However I think it would make it more funny/meme if they added in some dialogue like \"it's pizza time\" or \"fix the god damm door\".On the other side, some negative comment, the spiderman (Tom) was absoultely pissing me off, including aunt May. Personally I disagree to their point of view, and that do really screw up my mood for supporting the movie. Everything started with their morality and it's awful to see such a tragic consequence caused by a stupid decision of Spiderman decide to save the Villian's life. Of course it did end up well at the end, the \"villains\" were saved and returned to their original universe safely, maybe some would say that's worth it. But if you have seen Marvel's \"What if\" series, you might realize that when something is meant to happen, it will happen at the end no matter the process of causing it to happen, just like the death of Dr Strange's partner. Of course people might say this is a conspiracy, that's just because this is a superhero movie and superhero movies always have a good ending but that doesn't mean bad ending can be totally excluded.This has totally written the side of the immaturity and childish mindset of the Spiderman portrated by Tom Holland.There are also some serious plot holes such as how the hell is Dr Strange not capable of defeating Spider man. Come on, that is seriously under-performing Dr Strange's ability. Just because of Spiderman's math brain and therefore got Dr strange trapped in the mirror dimension? Second, when Dr Strange casts the \"brain wash\" spell at the end in order to stop more tragic things happen to their universe, couldn't he just specify certain people would still keep their memory of Peter Parker as spiderman? As it shown in the first spell cast, he is totally capable of doing it without disrupting anything. The chaos was just cause by the immaturity and undecisive act from the childish Spiderman, repeatingly interrupting Strang's spell cast.However, some good points about the movie would be there is not really any boring scene, every single scene had their meaning and role. And the most exciting part was the very end bonus scene trailering the upcoming Dr Strange movie. That will be another storyline of the multiverse and looking forward for marvel to introduce more and more to us about the multiverse.I'm giving this an 8 totally because of my favour towards Dr Strang's fancy magic and the re-appearance of the past spiderman actors.Story base, base on the performance of Tom Holland's Spiderman (not acting skills but the character itself) would abssolutely bring the rating down by at least 1 or 2.", "Nostalgic Does Not Mean Good": "I generally don't feel the need to leave reviews for movies, but I was reading others', and I felt the need to speak out.I love me some Marvel movies, and especially Spiderman, but goodness, this was a piece of gutter trash hidden behind a sweet chocolate layer of nostalgia. The plot of the movie started with PP's identity being released - okay - I like the concept. Surely that would be a thing for heroes in the MCU, and surely that would cause some issues with picking up regular life. I'm in it.Then comes a nonsensical argument amidst a dangerous and poorly understood Strange spell that can tear universes apart, and the end result: exactly that. Okay, weird. But pobody's nerfect. Let's continue.Suddenly, good ol' baddies from the days of yore start appearing to give Spidey a bad day. And PP decides that it's better to cure them, labeling it a second chance (or, if considering the other movies, third, fourth, fifth chance?). Risk the universe to cure a crocodile -- yea, okay bud.Q1 = what on Earth (our Earth, specifically) were Spider-Tobes and Spider-Drew doing while these villains ran amuck?Q2 = where were literally any other Avenger?Q3 = why why WHYYY not cure these bad guys in their Wizard Dungeon cages? Nah, I can trust Jamie Foxx.Here's the kicker - some of these villains have already died in their timeline. So we don't even know if they will be alive when they return! That being the case, does it make sense to try and vaccinate these guys, risking lives of loved ones (and subsequently murdering sweet old, but very not old and confusingly good-looking Aunt Mae)? Then, the final solution -- the very one the movie started with. Except now, you're down an aunt. Idk, Dr Strange could have saved us 2 hours there.Logic and reason were replaced with nostalgic nods to the past, it was long, and WHERE THE BLEEP WAS VENOM! Otherwise, not too bad.", "It is Ok": "In this film, Spider-Man turns to Dr. Strange for help and he, so to speak, exceeds his official powers and, accordingly, all these actions lead to unfavorable consequences, which the audience watches with pleasure.If you look, then such actions of exceeding authority are born from small and insignificant actions. I'll try to make out an example on this very Marvel universe, which can be easily transferred to the familiar world:The heroes of the film went through more than one mortal battle with the invaders, risked their lives, suffered, and also fought with themselves to save the rest. Consequently, a certain connection arises between these heroes, formed on the basis of professional activity. After the next rescue of the world, superheroes return to ordinary life, and the saved citizens can relate to the saviors in different ways - there are always ignorant, deceived and dissatisfied. But the heroes are not used to despair and continue to overcome difficulties, but it is not always possible to solve the problem with a simple dialogue. And the saviors do not stop there, and the idea may come to them: 'Why not ask for help from your comrade, with whom you fought side by side the other day for the sake of saving grateful and not very citizens?' Indeed, this may seem like a good idea, and that same 'Comrade' will not refuse, because he understands that he may have a similar problem and helps using his abilities (Official?).But such cases begin differently, when saving the world, the heroes help each other, using these forces, thereby strengthening the current and future connection.This is an example of the emergence of corruption, and further, potentially, the connection is strengthened and the most important vital problems are replaced by materialistic interests, and more often by mutual ones. After that, these ties grow, more mutually beneficial members of the same group of saviors appear.", "Lol": "Amazing movie. The plot is perfect! The acting 10/10!

It is sometimes surprising that with such a hackneyed theme of superhero cinema, screenwriters manage to find and use new catchy moves and solutions. However, the only frustrating thing is that, judging by the current top 250 rating and the general trend, the demand for 1 one-time (albeit good) blockbuster films is constantly growing, little by little depreciating much more complex and powerful films and thereby reducing the potential and fuse of talented young people. Directors to release films of a different kind.", "The fact that its so good that I don't have guts to watch it again": "Peter Parker has been one of my favourite characters especially when it was introduced in Marvel Cinematic Universe.For me MCU's spider man is the best and I have always felt so connected with this character that sometimes I might think that this all is real.Having so much emotional connect with MCU's Peter Parker maybe one of the reasons that I was too excited for the movie and at same time I was bit sad about the trilogy end. Entering the theatre with mixed emotions and coming out on the verge of crying is my way to summarise the movie experience.You'll laugh, cry, feel nostalgic, feel happy in some scenes and just in the next scene you'll be heartbroken.This movie will give you a roller coaster of emotions.This is the best trilogy end but also heart breaking and the more I think of it...makes me more sad.Seeing all three spider mans together was so satisfying, those fight scenes, small talks and the conversation about responsibility and loosing people you've loved our all worth the excitement.I just wish MJ and Ned come back.Appreciation for the character development of Peter Parker:\nFrom being a 14 year old young boy whose full of life and wants to become an avenger, wants to save people to realising the responsibility of a super hero to learning how many sacrifices you need to make to do one thing that's right.Its Great!!Aunt May will always be missed.Happy has been a great character throughout the MCU .And I'm very excited for Dr. Strange: Multiverse of Madness.Seeing all the spider man villains together has been a nostalgic moment.One thing i wished in the movie was seeing a scene of Morgan Stark with Peter Parker.Every spider man fan will absolutely love this movie, this gives the best end to Tobey Maguire's spider man.Tom, Zendaya and Jacob will always have a special place in my heart!!", "Honestly it's not that good": "Lets be honest. The movie isn't that good. It's corny and kind of cringey at times. The cinematography isn't that good. The acting is B at best. The story is all over the place. This is just a fan base milking cash cow mainstream brain rot blockbuster. The fact that this has such high ratings is obvious that bot accounts or sponsored reviews (paid reviewers) to inflate ratings. I mean given a 150m+ dollar budget for a movie, what's paying a few thousand to fake reviews?Meh.", "amazing movie love this movie": "They did it! A Spider-Man trilogy finally stuck the landing! Spider-Man: No Way Home is an impressive culmination of the films that came before it, with an engaging storyline, exciting action, laugh out loud moments, and dramatic consequences. The beginning climb is a little slow, but it's an exhilarating ride once things get swinging. I don't exactly know how this movie will hold up after multiple viewings, as there are some plot points that don't quite make sense when you start to think about them, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself this first time.", "bad": "My way of saying bad is not because i am against marvel, but its because its absolutely overhyped in any way, any i think it is a good movie, but not as good as people think it is, here on the imdb list it says its better than parasite, joker, and other amazing movies so in conclusion its good but not that good.", "Takes awhile to get going but sticks the landing": "I love Spider-Man so much I first got onto imdb years ago to complain about Raimi's 3rd movie, ha! No Way Home was the first movie I've seen in a theater in over two years. I was not liking it for about the first half. Spoilers ahead. I felt like a lot of the character choices were off, and just there to set up the plot. Why would Dr. Strange ever agree to this spell to begin with? He himself says there's no great reason to do it. Then Peter messes up his own spell by repeatedly talking? How dumb is he? Plus Dr. Strange is that easily distracted? Also... all it takes to defeat Dr. Strange is to web him up in a universe he himself created? Not buying it. And I also didn't buy that Peter felt so deeply about the wellbeing of the super villains. Also a lot of the first half (and my 16 year old son agreed) felt like fan faction, like \"Wouldn't it be cool if these two were in a cell beside each other?\" And the jokes almost all felt forced.However, all my critiques went away as soon as the other Spider-Men showed up. From then on the movie was magic to me, and my boyhood love of Spider-Man returned intact! They were so great together! And the writing really picked up, too! Funny, and truly touching. I loved the scene where they gave each other props. And Garfield saving Holland's girlfriend? Gold. The bittersweet ending? Also gold. So 6 stars for the movie pre-Spider-MEN, 10 for it after. Averages out to 8. I'd watch it again, but maybe start it halfway through.", "An Emotional Ride": "Just watched this movie today. It's an emotional ride with characters from other Spider-Man movies blended into one. If you Marvel And Spiderman fan you should def watch this.Great Action Scenes and great acting that just don't relay on special effects to make this movie intresting. Great acting to cause its very hard to connect all the pieces from Franchise in one movie, but def they pull it off somehow.A good movie 2 see 4 sure\u270c\u270c\u270c", "Jokes": "The jokes in the movie were just not good. I enjoyed it but i thought it could be better due to the fact that a lot happened but not in the way i wanted it to happen.", "A love letter for spider-man": "Maybe the previous installments of the Spider-Man of the MCU were somewhat disappointing due to the dependence of the arachnid on other characters like Iron Man or ... Iron Man, something which this installment tries in its own way to fix.The story and the acting feel more solid, actually I don't remember getting so emotional about a spider-man movie before.The villains of the previous versions of the friendly neighbor are back, and how could it be otherwise they steal the show, it is incredible to see them interact, it is awesome the fact that we learn a little more about them and how some of them relate with each other.There are an infinity of references to the previous installments, each character that returns, has their moment of nostalgia, as well as there is a bit of a lot of fan service.There were many expectations but he easily manages to meet them, it is not perfect, but in the end it feels like the only spider-man movie of the MCU made with love, the ending despite being satisfactory, much in fact, still leaves many doubts, I'm excited for what's next for this character.", "Really loved it!": "I didn't want to watch this before i was caught up in phase four and so I didn't see it in the cinema. I really regret that now as this is a great movie for the big screen.It may be a weaker 10/10 and I can't call it a masterpiece, but it hit all the right spots for me. I grew up with the old spider man movies and I've enjoyed all of them. This doesn't hit emotinally as hard and is a bit too light hearted overall. But the awesome visuals and effects and the captivating storyline with great pacing kept me immersed and thrilled throughout it.Some movies are good in the oscar winning way and pleacing movie critics. This movie was just really enjoyable and fun. I laughed out loud, got excited, impressed and shed some tears at multiple points. Be it from sadness, romance or just hype.", "Not the best but still good.": "I enjoyed watching this movie but it is not the best movie what people think. The ratings on this website are exaggerated.

I have been watching movies at this cinema for last 18 years. I watched Spiderman 2 in same cinema in 2004 with the neighbours kids and the few early movie experiences I do remember. The feelings this movie brought back was unbelievable.I mean marketing sucks sometimes and Sony executed this perfectly. To hold back on Tobey and Andrew not doing press before the release of the film was a Big Gamble. How could you not.I heard that they were gonna go with Civil War style war between Peter and Strange but I'm glad they didnt do this. The movie starts great with amazing visuals. The cinemas I watched and worked in for 9 years has 2nd biggest IMAX screen in Europe. I saw it build and I had practiced where the perfect seat is. It was 3d so ROW G 21 with perfect left and right of the screen. You are immersed completely. The same was great scene in Spiderman Far from home with Mysterio looked great too.Ok to the movie. My first review for IMDB. This film did everything and more. It was end of the Spiderman multi verse just like End game. The build up that we saw in the trailers and clips was great and nothing was spoiled. The film goes from monster hunting to helping them to complete utter despair to rebuilding the film again. The experience felt so surreal like I wasnt watching what I was watching from all villains showing up to Tobey and Andrew.In the cinema \"I'm quite the scientist myself\" easily got the biggest laugh by Goblin. Like I said I've watched alot of movies in that cinema even worked there and I have never seen audience laugh, cheers and react in the way people did for Spiderman no way home. I'm guessing Tobey to Andrew brought back all the nostalgia. The interaction between the Spideys' was great too. I wish we got more of it. Tobey acting was in opinion out shined and elevated the scene compared to Tom and Tobey. The way villains betray Tom's Spidey and was great way to build tension for an amazing set for the ending. I liked they are abit rusty \ud83e\udd23 with each other as learn to work together.To me felt this movie wasn't long enough. They could have easily split this movie into 2 and believe me no one would have batted an eye. To see Andrew and Tobey reminisce about their Spiderman moments and memories was great.I liked that movie wasn't too MCU heavy but stand on its own. They multi purely used to set it up and just as quickly as ended it at the end.Future looks great for Tom's Spiderman movie with what looks like a set up for Venom with after credit scene as. I think it would be a wasted opportunity not being back Tobey and Andrew for future team ups and events. Secret wars (wink, wink) ps. I tried.", "Just a caution": "I would like to declare a caution before watching this movie you had to take a piss because it's too hard during watching even if you can pause but the level of excitement , enthusiasm and nostalgia is just beyond any expectation and will make you simply can't pause for a second or miss any momentthe film also is full of details and some easter eggs from previous franchise or any Spider Man work , so make sure to check on that after watching so you wont miss any details\nIt is a movie will fit every generation and i think it will fit in every timefinally , would like to thank everyone who bring the bright idea of gathering all the amazing characters together again and make that possible on a screen which is i think the most nostalgic thing ever happen to me watching a movie with a well written script.", "Dream come true.": "A must watch spidey segment focused on mcu spiderman actually becoming spiderman and meaning what it takes.

I dont know what else to write pls imdb let me upload this....", "Spiderman: No Way Again": "It's not that fantastic to watch.. It's a lot of emotional stop, the fighting scenes are basic.. and the SPX are so overdone that it looks like you're watching a cartoon movie or 3D animation.. I even think the real actors were not present during the action scenes.. I hope the current movie makers finally listen to the people, and stop overdoing those SPX, and making it more real.. Why would we even watch a movie if the actors are performing not even one stunt themselves.. Or that you clearly see that it's an animation doll.. It's so funny that the actors walk on the red carpet doing like they're the big star while nothing was real in the movie.. I would be very ashamed to show myself..", "what a fantastic movie": "What a good movie, sure that all Spiderman came back I thought it was really cool and how docter strange His role played very cool how all the enemies came together and the final battle and how all Spiderman swing together I really thought The humor was also really nice and the build-up was also really cool but only a sad ending but yes very nice film really highly recommended.", "Biggest & best MCU movie 2 date": "All I have to say is if you thought infinity war & endgame we're amazing then this exceeded both of them put together.SPECTACULAR AMAZING SPIDER-MAN!!!!!!!", "A new beginning for MCU": "First of all, I would like to say that I had quite high expectations for this movie. Especially after I've seen all the trailers and leaks (both confirmed and argued) about this movie's plot.But in the end, the movie passed my expectations with an A+\nIt was a complete surprise for me, that MCU decided to bring up so many stuff and put it all into this one movie.Without further ado, I can say that this movie is just great! A masterpiece, that connected all the Spider-Man movies all together and showed us that it was all a part of one story.I really loved how Tom Holland prepared himself for this movie. He was finally looking so much \"bulkier\" and fit for the role. Another amazing thing was his acting - it was just stunning. Every deciding moment left me speechless, sitting there in awe and catching air from time to time.The reason why it's 9 and not 10, is because I still did not see how the relations between Peter Parker and MJ actually developed and why these relations are exactly this way in the movie... Well, and the motivation of some villains also did not make quite sense to me...So to sum it up, it is an amazing movie!!! One of the best superhero movies there are. And this movie showed us, that there is still much to see.Just hope that MCU keeps the quality of their future movies at least at the same level as in this movie. Raising the buzz and expectations is what MCU is really good at, but making up for all that expectations is what really matters!At least they managed to fully succeed with Spider Man: No Way Home!So that's a standing applause and thanks from me.", "Amazing movie i watched it": "Amazing movie i love this I am not a fan before watching this movie now I am a fan boy\nThanks to read it\nLove tom Holland\nA lot love Zendaya and doctor.", "Even the germans cheered": "People in german cinemas tend to not cheer. Most you can expect here is a crowd nodding, with some lone person yelling \"woohoo\". I find it sometimes curious that in other countries whole crowds go bonkers, i've only seen this in Infinity War / Endgame here (despite beeing in a big cinema in a major city on premiere-day)... and: Spiderman: No Way Home. The Crowd went insane several times. Why? The Movie was, in my opinion, simply one of the best MCU movies out there. On par with Infinity War and Endgame. And its most likely the best Spiderman Movie too.The Money Shot Scenes were excellent, the acting was simply great, the CGI was point on. I saw this movie 2 days ago and i'm still stunned. There were quite a lot \"Avengers - Assemble\" moments in here. Whoever managed to pull this whole thing off, needs a raise. 10 out of 10 stars, would give more if possible.", "This movie is saved by Doctor Strange": "Peter Parker is so dumb in this movie.I only watched it for Doctor Strange.Why is it he was trying to fix villains. In the end we don't know what happened to those villains he fixed.", "Stupid Idea": "The premise was terrible and that's that should be said about the movie yeah they fighting scenes were cool the cgi was spectacular as always and willem dafoe was absolutely brilliant but with a premise this bad the whole movie just felt empty.I think that for Peter to go to strange with this idea of making everyone forget that he was Peter Parker was a solid idea it makes sense for a teen to make such rush and unthought of decisions but strange a grown up man who is supposed to be the greatest wizard, and the wisest one at that, to go ahead with Peter's plan just felt forced and straight up delusional.The whole movie felt corny, it felt like it could never stay serious for more than a second and it could never stay still for even half a second i know this generation's attention span is that of a goldfish's but goddamn do they need to relax. And even at the one point with the three spider mans talking where they tried to relax their chemistry was so off that i just couldn't bare watching it, additionally they dragged that scene for so long that i got physically frustrated watching it.The ending although predictable was still disappointing it felt like we got nowhere as a matter of fact it felt like our story regressed from where it had began. And the way Dr Strange ended it by telling spiderman what would happen if he cast the spell LIKE WHY TF DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT THE FIRST TIME. At that point we already know what's going to happen and Peter does too so it was sooooooo Forced and stupid it made me sick plus how did he perform the spell without the magical thingy he needed at the beginning of the movie.Overall movie was inconsistent, boring and quite simply bland yeah like i said cgi was great, fighting scenes were great so if you are looking for another mindless superhero movie here you go but for me it just didn't do it.", "Is a film a good": "Sorry, but I don't know English.

This is just a work of art, if you are fan of all the films and the character then you really have to see this.I had my doubts before watching it, I've been very disappointed by some of the drivel Marvel have been coming out with so I tempered my expectations. Would they add too many woke elements? Would they force diversity and virtue signalling down our throats? The answer? Nope! This is truly homage to all the Spiderman movies, it would be so easy to ridicule them or try to better them, but this honors them. They took those original characters and enhanced them, with truly great performances by William Defeo, Alfred Molina and even Jamie Foxx.The best part is how they take all those ingredients and mix them together to create some serious gourmet stuff. You don't get too little or too much of each element, and it doesn't detract from the main course which is Tom Holland. I haven't been convinced by him in the first two movies, but he has won me over now. The best decision they made was dropping all that Iron Spiderman crap, Spiderman - Presented by Tony Stark got boring very quickly and detracted too much from the characters ability to stand on his own, along with his esteemed friends and team.By the end of this film, you'll believe in this Spiderman, just like the others.", "THE SPECTACULAR SPIDERMAN!!!": "The Spiderman no way home has officially finally droped. Wow. What can i say expect that the Marvel franchise is spinning with the new open multiverse. Spiderman no way home is the BEST Marvel movie so far.

Who is a fan of the hero or even of marvel movies.This film marks the maturing of Peter Parker as a hero, really ready as we see in the comics.Characters with very well-crafted narrative arcs. Anyone who is in doubt about the movie, can watch it for sure will be surprised too.", "Multiverse of sadness": "It was not a bad movie, just the same thing tepeated like in the Sam Raimi version- they just couldn't handle so many characters properly. The movie should have been longer to be able to dig deeper. The story could have been better, so the fight scenes and the dialouges seemed very poor, rather like improvisations. It was realky good to see familiar faces, but as mentioned they were just packed in the movie nit allowing the actors the times they would deserve. There were some inconsistent parts, but in the end it is for kids and seeing that way it is fine. Of course there were cool scenes and good jokes, but we cannot expect the level of the previous Marvel movies. Peter Parker is not Tony Stark and maybe for the good. Would be nice to see a part where the script is more intelligent. Some csmeos could have been done better and monumental but at least they give the characters the audience wanted. This time Disney did maybe learn something: they finally listened to their audience and gave the characters we wanted to see with some action. Ps: this does mot mean that fans will forgive Disney that they killed Luke Skywalker in Star Wars\ud83d\ude44Anyway, people with nostalgic feelings will dig it.", "Couldn't live up to hype": "This movie is a visual masterpiece and the FX crew deserves an Oscar nomination. However, the direction and writing of this film was very underwhelming. It's a really fun and funny time to see all the humor and cool moments but as a whole this film just felt unnecessary in so many ways. If you just want to take it at face value then by all means it's probably the best fun movie of the year. But I fear that this next phase of Marvel won't come close to the meaning and relevance of the previous phase.I simply didn't care during this move as I hoped to and I couldn't help but notice the blaring creative decisions that were made in the production room rather than seeing a unique story unfold.It's a story of dumb decisions and half of the movie are literal blank stares. Idk why Marvel loves doing that, it's so awkward. Just say something, don't just stare at the other characters. But that's easier than writing meaningful lines. It's a visual masterpiece with ok writing and direction. Again, it had its great moments, but was not an AMAZING film like everyone has been saying.Maybe it's the media and culture's fault for hyping it up too much but I expected a better story than what I saw.", "Seriously do not understand the positive reviews": "This film is complicated and without adding details to spoil it for anyone. It try's to be a comedy throughout that then jumps into high action sequences that in themselves are well made but trying to add to a story that is poor with so plot errors and attempts to just pull so many things together that it becomes tiresome. As a fan of the wonderful original spider man comics. Why not loose the comedy keep the story dramatic with strong character development. The Joker was a perfect example of how to get it right but I'm completely bemused by the positive reviews for this film. I would love to list the faults one by one but you can see them for yourself and hopefully pick up on the childish sentiment that is also tightly woven into this pointless film.", "Making history": "This movie is not just another superhero movie, this will change the movie industry forever.Im affraid I will never see a greater movie than this. If you ever played Zelda Ocarina of time you will understand the feeling I have right now.", "A 100% delight to spidey fans": "Gives you the most satisfactory ending ever.Amazing story line with everything you want as spiderman fan. Ultimate spider movie and a must watch. As amazing as infinity war. Go on spidey.....", "Fantastic Closure": "After watching this film, there was only one word that I could think of: Closure.I felt like I finally got closure with Toby's and Andrew's versions of Spider-Man in this film. It's so great that they brought them back to us. And it's clever that they use the concept of \"multi-verse\" this way.It felt like yesterday when we were all weeping with Andrew's Spider-Man for not being able to save Gwen that night. But when he successfully saved MJ from the fall this time and bursted into tears, he had his closure. And so did I.Spider-Man is a neighbourhood hero. Over the years, they saved so many people's lives by killing the villains, who in the end, are people, too. In this film, a second chance was given to the villains to be cured and live. But actually, it was a second chance for the \"Spider-Men\", too, to do it differently this time. And that's closure, too.When Tom's Parker eventually got Dr Strange to erase him from everyone's memory, he would have to start over again, in a humble apartment, without MJ, Ned, and college. But when he was dancing in the sky, he was the Spider-Man we are all so familiar with, who did not carry the glory of being an \"Avenger\", but was so free and just caring about the neighbourhood without being known for who he actually was. That brought Tom's trilogy to the basics. This is closure in the perfect way.Great film. Fantastic closure. I just loved it.", "This is the worst movie ever, that ruined the Spider Man for millions of fans.": "We have an opportunity now to bring together 20 years of world-builds and 3 different Spider Man franchises. Which may create a fantastic movie, because such an opportunity will never happen again.And unfortunately, it is not what happened.The movie is one of the worst ones ever made: the plot is just convenient with main characters making stupid decisions one after another; the plot line and resolution are created out of nowhere with no thoughts put into them; the dialogues are stupid, not funny, overstretched and useless; the character development is absent; the scenes are empty; and after that - they bring the characters from other movies and this is it. This is literally it. There is nothing else about this movie, that matters. They could have just taken a photo of all of them together and it would have been the same.And now - this is what we have got. The ruined opportunity due to corporate greed and laziness. And I am very sad, that instead of creating something special that will stay on its own be one of the best movies ever made - we got this instead.And yes, this movies is 13th best according to IMDB. Which is higher than some LOTR and Se7en.I am done with Marvel and IMDB as such.", "Expect disappointment and you will never get disappointed": "Weak plot\nNo proper story\nLack of drama.Can be better if they had focus more on action.Villains are very very weak, destroyed in a couple of minutes.", "10/10 Would get covid again": "As a lifelong fan of Spider-Man, this movie just surpassed my expectations. I avoided any spoilers and it was well worth it. I got COVID after watching the movie...\nThey clean the theaters but they get a depressed and anxious 15 year old to do it \"the best he can\". I'm surprised I haven't gotten a UTI from the theatre and I go pretty often. Honestly, such a fantastic movie and if you're a fan of Spidey, you'll love it!", "This is a 7. Very weak plot line and cheap comedy": "Very poor writing. The beginning is too slow. Then it becomes childish which made Dr. Strange look dumb. Then three spiderman fought with several villain for no reason. They converted sandman first whereas he is the only one who wants what they want. Then Green Goblin was waiting for attacking when all villains fall. This is really a teen movie.Its a good movie but not a movie you will love watching again and again.", "Perfect Superhero Movie": "Can't fault this movie from my perspective.I thought Andrew Garfield was awesome in this too!MCU keeps delivering. Love all the Spider-man stuff thats in flight atm \ud83d\udc4d", "Solid movie all around": "Worth the price of admission & keeps you engaged. If you're going to see a movie this December it should be this one hands down. Marvel has taken the crown at the movie theatre for the foreseeable future. This isn't the best movie of the year, Dune has that honour.", "Main characters act like a kid": "I thought this movie would be great since I knew all spidermen will be there, but it was a complete let down.Dr. Strange acts like a child who doesn't know how spells work. Basically a child with a napalm. Then Tom Holland, who is supposed to be a genius creates a whole mess and because of him and Dr. Strange, people die. Two old spidermen are portrayed as whiny dudes which is pathetic.In the end, they cure villains who are clearly bad people who showed how bad they are after they got super powers and Tom/Spideman wanted to cure them. It's like trying to cure Hilter by removing all armies from him. Bad person is bad, and it's not a super power problem. The only person worth saving is Octavius, but everyone else is simply a bad person.In the end, mature characters act like kids, plot doesn't make sense and it is all based on nostalgia.", "The Best Of Movie In Mcu": "A great, great movie, well directed, a wonderful story and plot, everything is wonderful Even if the events burn out, you should watch it in the cinema Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, great performance.", "Amazing (no spoilers in this review)": "The movie was setup perfectly and kept on going. The pace was amazing. This was an experience of my life. The movie made endgame look like child's play as the actors poured their heart into it and the story left me laughing, crying, and on the edge of my seat throughout the whole time. I would recommend you watch this movie as soon as possible.", "Not just an Movie, Its an Emotion": "Superb entertainment for all Marvel and other fans, Best screenplay and comic timings. Its not one of the best, its the best of all. Must go in theatre and watch this.", "Yes, it really has surprises": "I didnt expect so much, that the 2 old spiderman would be involved, but wtf, it happened, seeing 3 peter parker in 1 frame, with their personal stories, uniqueness character.Also I love how MCU made the reason to cover the plotholes I thought before, like why was only the villains got pulled to this universe, why didnt dr Strange get involved in most of the fight momen, but still left a plothole on my head, how exactly the spell \"everyone forget Peter Parker\" while Spiderman is still exist, and still was involved in Endgame, also Happy said that he knows May from the Spiderman.", "Easily the greatest spider man movie to date.": "This movie captures so much more of what I have wanted in the MCU for a decent while. More dramatic and dark theming while still remaining funny and entertaining during other parts of the movie. Plus to have the classic cast of villains and Spider-Men in the movie makes it a special treat.", "Reem": "Reem Abu Dhabi is a good place to stay in and out of the UK and is a very good place to stay in and out of the UK and is a very good place to stay in and out of the UK and is a very good place to stay in.", "Thank you MARVEL!": "Last Spiderman movie is an Ode to fans. You can go and watch it. 100% worth your money and time.Thank you MARVEL and SONY for making this happen.This is what WE fans want and need.I paid for it and I will most likely go for a second round.One of the Best Superheroes movies out there. Easily comparable with Dark Knight Trilogy, Infinity War Saga, and Snyder's Cut JL.Go and watch it! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "First hour meh, second hour classic Marvel": "The first hour of the movie is quite slow and doesn't really go anywhere. Once the villains from the previous movies escape though the pace really picks up and it becomes classic Marvel. It moves at a ferocious pace and easily switches between drama, comedy and emotion, sometimes even in the same scene. Seeing Holland, Garfield and Maguire share scenes is a real treat; it does emphasise in my opinion though that Maguire is just a bit dull. Holland and Garfield together are fantastic and really compliment each other brilliantly. Similarly Alfred Molina is brilliant, if a little underused.Make sure you stay until the very end of the credits \ud83d\ude0a", "One of the best spiderman movie ever!!!!!": "Watched with zero expectations but even if i expect something bigger, it wasn't not gonna cover my shock that I experienced simply spectacular movie \ud83d\ude0d", "Just Incredible": "Wow, marvel really outdid themselves with this masterpiece the ultimate fan service. The action and the acting on point as well, Tom Holland is a superstar in the making.", "This movie 3000% worth it": "This movie i can watch 100 times and still not get boared. In the theater we cheered about 15-20 times and cried 2 times. This movie touches the heart.About acting the entire cast did the great job, the moments in movie are still in my mind.", "Amazing and crazy": "Don't watch trailer just go to watch in cinema just.And if you want watch in home just on 4K TV and that's not enough and you need good system sound to feel you inside in moves\nA best moves in 2019 to 2022.", "Really good movie but wasn't enough.": "The movie was really good. I enjoyed it very much. And being both MCU and Spider-Man fan watching this movie made me feel so good. The movie was very emotional, funny and thrilling the same time.I really wished they didn't show the trailer as 50% of the movie was spoiled in it. If not I would have rated this movie 8.5.", "BEST MCU movie yet": "Honestly, i never thought an MCU film about one superhero could ever beat how grand ENDGAME was as an Avengers movie. Obviously, No Way Home proved me wrong by being written brilliantly.I bet getting all the old actors for spider man and their villains is an extremely tough job, not to mention making it all make sense with the storyline and where Marvel is heading in terms of stories.But No Way Home really made everything work beautifully and I can't wait for Dr. Strange 2, especially after those post-post credit.10/10\nFully recommend.", "Milking for cheap nostalgia": "Let me start by saying I like the original trilogy and old school movie fun. I loved the times when the plot, the dialogue and jokes were the real engine of the movie and keep you invested in the story and Cgi was just for entertainment.The whole premise of this movie is selfish, childish, illogical behaviour off all main characters and hard push for cheap nostalgia.Reasons for my statement:\n1. So what you or your friends didn't get into school or everyone knows your identity. Work on it turn it in your favor, put an efford ! Everyone knew who is Iron man, wasn't obstacle for him.2. I understand teenager asking magician to make everyone forget about spiderman. I don't understand wise groun up man accepting it.3. At least if you make a spell make it Right! Stop indulging stupid requests. What's the big deal revealing yourself for your aunt?!4. Everyone make a decision for yourself. If you decide to be a villan it's your choice and you should accept consequences And they did, and killed many innocent people so why trying to cure them and endanger people around you?5. Lock your mortal Aunt with a room full of villas, what could happen. Honestly how more dumb you can do?6. And finally let's bring all actors, played spider man before, push for nostalgia and I will forgive you everything, well no thank you.To summarise it was boring and waste of time. Couple of short fun action and decent performance of Deffo and Tom Holland. That's all.", "Chaos of characters": "Not a single character developed any sort of depth throughout the film and there was no clear plot line. This resulted in scenes meant to be emotional to not be very affecting at all. The film lays weight on giving the audience a nostalgic and sentimental experience which it does slightly but it harms the film because there's too many characters. The characters are pressed in which causes them to be very shallow and unnecessary when there could be a clear antagonist instead. Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire's entrances are quite non cool when they had the potential to have a super epic entrance in some other way like a fight scene for example. The whole story is rather silly and makes very little sense, it's all caused by doctor strange's spell when in reality he should've stopped and came up with a better spell like making everyone forget what mysterio said.", "A reunion, not a film.": "Once you get beyond the fact so many familiar faces are in the same film, you realize the plot is very basic, and the action all quite ordinary. All of the classic Spider-Man moments are referenced not actually seen. After starting out as a Doctor Strange movie, No Way Home becomes more of a reunion than a film. Have we forgotten what a story really is?", "Exceed the hype": "No goona tell you much but I've always been disappointed after seeing hyped movies due to high expectations but this one exceeds the hype. Watch it in theaters it's not just a movie it's a experience.", "We got what we want": "The greatest thing about this film is that you feel like marvel gave the audience everything they ever dreamt of, the plot is not great but who cares? The theatre was on fire and for the first time that didn't bother me! This movie is all about nostaliga and scenes to tell our kids that our dream has come true. I can't wait to watch it again and again and again.", "2nd to only Endgame.": "No doubt the best Spiderman movie ever, Storywise its a rollercoaster ride with Great action, perfectly timed jokes and full of nostalgic moments. I love the vfx and it's definitely should be enjoyed in 3d. Ending was also great and this movie opened the doors to infinite possibilities for MCU future. Thanks Marvel for bringing us this movie.", "A nostalgia machine": "For those Spider-Man fanboy, especially those who grew up with Spider-Man movies will be totally biased. This movie is a fan service fiesta. Don't use too much logic for problem solving though. Just enjoy how Peter Parker uses his method in dealing with his problem, which made me questioned some of his decisions here. Aside from it, it's a must-watch.", "Closer to a Disney comedy than a Spider-Man film": "I have no idea how this movie got such high ratings on IMDB. This is in no way, shape, or form worthy of it. Again, Disney has turned an iconic franchise into just another one of their witty family friendly Disney Channel movies. 90% of this movie is just playful banter between the characters, and the 30 seconds of action scenes weren't stimulating. Never did I feel any sense of genuine danger or struggle for Peter in this film, hence zero character development. Yes, it was extremely nostalgic to see the previous Spider-Men return, but it would of been great to see them in a well made movie. This was not. Cheaply entertaining at best.", "Best ever spider man movie": "#awesomestory #wellmade #blockbuster. Movie is fantastic and super the best scene ever is 3 Peter Parker come together. Doctor octopus entry is mind blowing and Tom Holland acting is improving....", "More So a Parody and Shallow Fan Service": "\"Villains\" are not in the least bit threatening, GG is an absolute joke as an absolute cardboard cutout parody of his former self, and there's no real character arc/development here besides for a convenient ending to pull Spiderman back into The Sony Verse and out of The MCU.Doesn't need a spoiler here as everyone by now knows the what 'big reveal' is, and it's just more shallow fan service.Lazy plot, manipulative and contrived, - in line with so-called 'blockbusters' these days and I'd compare this with the last Star Wars film to a tee. Don't listen to the raving fan boys reviews.I'm rating it a 1 to only pull down the score. My actual rating is more a long the lines of 6.0, as the effects are great, and enough action to warrant a viewing. However, calling this the best Spiderman film (Toby's 2nd one was the best) is an insult not only to the films, but the comics as well.", "My Favorite Superhero": "Kiddo\nromantic\ncool\nfrom noob be a great person\nSpiderman is my inspiration.I remember when i was kid, my first time i got sipderman comic from my mom, i always read it every night, then now sipderman have a great technology.", "DON'T WATCH! WAIST OF MONEY": "It was the most boring Movie I've ever seen, didn't make any sense, so baaaaaaaad! They bring other spiderman into it to make more interesting and it did the opposite, and it ruined doctor strange for me also. Sooooooooo Much regret watching this.", "They nailed it!!": "The film manages to handle with care and elegancy almost all of its cast. Good dialogue and great action scenes across the board. Willem Dafoe was a real show stealer, though acting was stellar from everyone involved.The only thing I would criticise is the whole premise of the multiverse and how it occured. Dr Strange would never cast such dangerous spell and Peter getting in the way and messing it up like that felt kinda weird. But I guess the movie had to happen somehow.9/10 from me. A must watch for all superhero/comic book fans for sure.", "Don't miss the movie i beg ya": "The movie was packed with full of stuffs you cant possibly imagine it's there. Its like all of your dreams mashed up together come true. I genuinely lost my throat shouting.", "Not the movie I Expected": "This movie is made for fans only\nPeople like me who just watched the earlier movies of spidy, and actually expected an interesting plot and a good story will be disappointed for sure.Well the surprises are nice and even exciting, but you cannot build a whole film on gimics like that.I really liked Far From Home which was interesting and fan.This one's plot is ridicules.It is only fan but not interesting at all!!. I felt like it was made for teenagers fans only and that Marvel just was to make another pice in their multiverse puzzle.", "A Masterpiece.": "This is awesome. Probably the biggest film of the year.

You have to watch it.", "A bit Stale.....": "**NO SPOILERS**\nI am a Marvel fan, this is not a 'hate' review, it's merely a disappointed one. This movie was good, not exceptional, not phenomenal, and certainly not the best marvel movie. I believe it could have been showcased in much special ways.First of all, I was disappointed in the revealing and introduction of characters. I feel as if they were rushed and could have been done in so much cooler ways for special moments to be created. For me, this aspect of the movie was a bit lacklustre.I believe there could have been much more action, and more 'edge of the seat' moments. This movie missed this, and didn't include much forceful action as I hoped it did.Maybe my expectations were too high, as I was already amazed by the trailer. I sort of expected what things were going to happen, but I wish the movie presented what I expected in much more of a phenomenal way. If you haven't watched the trailers (which I recommend you NOT to watch) then prepare to be amazed, as this movie will be great. However, watching the trailers made me know things that I wish I didn't know.I also believe the movie was a bit light hearted, and if it was slightly more dark, the movie would have been 10x better. For example, humour was placed in scenes where there didn't need to be any, and instead could have gone with a different approach. I personally like darker movies, however, I do understand that Spider-Man specifically, is aimed for all ages.How this movie is currently a 9.1 is beyond me, as that is totally bonkers. There is no way it is better than the blockbuster movies which are in the 8's and 9's! It had potential to make it there; 100%.All in all, the movie was a good one. It just didn't hit the heights I wished it hit.", "Incredible.": "Remembering 2019, when I watched Spider-Man Far From Home on the theater. Back than, I never expected the next movie to be something like this. Ever. Spider-Man: No Way Home exceeds my expectations in every way possible. I've watched it twice on the cinema, and my opinion that this is the best live-action Spider-Man movie ever made didn't change a bit. Will definitely watch it again :)", "Absolute let down": "This movie was a fan tribute with the inclusion of all the Spider-Men and I know lots of people who love it but there is one complaint I have with the movie:\nAll of Spider-Man far from home was building up to this movie, we were so close to finding out Spider-Man's identity after the death of mysterio, but by the end we still have no idea Spider-Man really is and it is so unfair.", "Nice movie": "With Peter Parker(Holland, owning the role) revealed to the world as Spider-Man, he and those closest to him have their lives ruined. He implores Dr Strange(Cumberbatch, compelling as always) to use his magic to help. And there is an attempt. But there are unintended consequences.If you're not interested in reading an extremely positive review of this, turn back now. I can't believe they actually did it. There's no way(eh?) that this should work. It should end up overstuffed, like Raimi's third entry did. Somehow, the fan service and nostalgia-bait does not overwhelm, and this has a real heart to it. The references are plentiful without ending up obnoxious. They managed to find a way to give the large cast enough.", "Amazing movie, the best movie I've ever seen": "It's the best movie I've ever seen, the story is very good and fantastic, Great acting. It's a big MCU movie. I really enjoyed in every moment \ud83d\udd25, it's the best Spider-Man movie, everything in the movie is great. Thanks to the staff.", "Best. Movie. Ever.": "Everything about the movie itself was great. My only disappointment is that I am in Korea, so I had to watch it with Korean subtitles. I'm Korean, but my personal experiences could've been better without the subtitles. Also, I found many scenes funny and hilarious, but I guess everyone else in the theater didn't, because there were too many times where I was laughing so hard, but had to keep quiet. The movie itself is a freaking master piece.", "Awesome!!": "Absolutely loved this movie. I don't see how they could ever top this Spiderman movie! This had the right mix of everything. I dont want to spoil it for anyone. If you havent seen this movie go see it.", "I generally like Spiderman": "I felt a little let down. The fan service was there and it was so fun to see all these characters from different spider-men franchises heroes and villains come together in one movie. But the entire film's purpose arose from Tom Holland's character's poor decision making and lack of insight. I understand he is interpreting a teenage character but this spider-man just kept creating more hurdles for himself to jump over where a rational actor would make a correct decision. Nonetheless it was enjoyable for the eyes but irritating for the head.", "A nostalgic ride for the spider fans": "A spectacular bringback of the cast of previous Spider-Man movies bringing references to the old movies with themselves. Besides the memories it reminds us of, Tom Holland shows a brilliant performance exceeding the ones in Homecoming and Far From Home.There is a bit too much plot in it to be squeezed in only one movie, but in a positive way, that is what makes it fast paced and unfortunately often confusing.The cinematics and the visual effects are stunning and a blessing for our eyes, just what we expect from an MCU film.Fans had putten the bar really high for this film and still it succeded to overcome. It failed at some requirements,but succeeded in most of them.", "Truly fantastic.": "I all its ways, the film was great. Humor, fear, tense and so much more. It can be considered as a Spiderman Endgame and this movie have changed the mcu's future from now on.", "The best Spider man movie ever": "I cried i laughed i jumped and i did everything, this was greatest movie on marvel universe for me, even better than end game, god you must watch this movie.", "Just aswome": "This film is amazing! The best Spider-Man film yet. It shows a lot of growth and maturity for Tom Holland's spider man and brings back the core values of what he stands for as he learns hes got to make sacrifices for the greater good. In the end, Tom became the Spider-Man we all know, living alone paying rent, made his own suit, and going to college. It made me so, so, so excited for the next movie, And that new suit. I almost cried watching it. It felt like he'd really become Spider-Man. Can't wait for where he'll show up next. I personally did not find the last two movies as interesting but this tops it all. The surprise appearances were amazing and had everyone in the cinema room gasping and applauding. It is a must watch movie in cinema for a great effect, the visuals and humour within were just amazing between all characters. Overall an emotional, funny, action packed film. So yup, This movie right here is one of the greatest Marvel movies yet in my opinion and there is a lot of magic going on within this movie, It's amazing that the Green Goblin and Doc Ock from Tobey's universe are in this movie and seeing them really does bring back memories from my childhood. Willem Dafoe is phenomenal & Alfred Molina was great. I think this crossover is new milestone for entire movie history.. I think.Jon Watts did a great job, what a direction man, hats off. Jon is really amazing making and directing movies. I can't say anything other than simple thank you to Jon Watts. The Fantastic4 movie welcomes him lol... First mid-credit scene was fun and sets up the next (I'm assuming it's the next) Spider-Man perfectly. The visuals in the second post-credit scene, even though only a snippet of Multiverse of Madness look spectacular. That film is gonna be huge and trippy, I am so excited to see Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness. Hell yeah!", "It's a good movie but Overrated as hell": "When i look at the imdb and other similar sites rating i was shocked. Look I love Spider-man but honestly this movie's so overrated cause of the nostalgia feel. When you look without being fan and criticize the movie you realize that the movie has too many flaws. Plot is weak and full of plot holes. If that nostalgia feel. If it wasn't for that nostalgia feeling, i would have given this movie 5 star rating. One of the best movies of all time for me; prestige(8.5),se7en(8.6),The dark knight(9.0) etc. And honestly this movie doesn't even come close to them for me this is why i shocked when i saw the ratings-reviews.", "Very good connected and a loose and err moments": "The movie starts with a dull concept of messing up with the magical spells.Later on movie picks its pace with a lot of nostalgic scenes by brilliant connection with previous Spiderman movies.Dr. Strange lost in its own magic, errrr, not a good idea.Overall movie connects with all other Marvel franchise movies (That's where Marvels are brilliant in).End was unexpected and different and gives a new start to lot of things.", "Best superhero movie after Endgame": "This is the best movie after Endgame. By multiverse they bought our favorite spider men and their villains this made marvel fans so happy and fulfilled. No lags in the movie. More villains should come under MCau and Marvel should fulfill fans.", "Definitely a great watch": "I'm not one to write reviews so I'll keep it brief. If you grew up watching the original Spiderman movie trilogy and caught the Amazing Spiderman movies when they came out, you'll absolutely appreciate this movie; it's basically a love letter to each generation of the Spiderman movies, and there's bound to be something there that makes you smile (good ol' Tobey did it for me). If you haven't, then you might be pretty lost and not catch many of the subtle nods thrown into the dialogue. Great popcorn flick, but it requires some 'homework' if you want the full experience.", "Spider man No Way Home": "This movie could have been more beautiful, but it is still wonderful Its special effects were very enjoyable, and as the story progressed, it had an interesting plot, and watching this film raises the viewers' expectations.", "Details": "Best Spider-Man so far and amazing details. They even put a small cut in a loop shape on Holland's cheek to match Toby's real life scar. Glad Tom talked them into making this third movie! Hope there's a fourth.", "best marvel movie ever!": "This movie is amazing honestly i watched it 3 times and i still can get bored of it.

Without doubt steals the show & his continuation of Green Goblin is excellent.Everyone forgets about Spider-Man in the end which I think is great touch & I was hoping it would extend beyond the screen and wipe my memory too.Marvel are doing a great job of making the DC universe look good, I'm now hoping for a venom 3 and hoping Sony can redeem this part of the franchise.Time to stop!", "It was fantastic": "I knew that there would be a continuation of the film, because in the last part, after the confession and exposure of Mysterio, that spider-man is Peter, nothing was known what happened next\nAnd then it became even more interesting!The plot is very interesting, mystical in moments!When Peter came to Dr. Strange, I thought that he still wouldn't do it and wouldn't decide on the ceremony.In the end, everything went wrong as they thought.After the ceremony, watching the movie was generally unexpected.At the same time, there are various jokes in the film, where you can distract from the tension in the film.And the special effects in the movie are just super!In general, who hasn't watched it yet-I advise everyone to turn it on and enjoy it!", "Lab Accidents": "This movie is about a guy that has been in a lab accident (Spider-Man) who fights other guys who have been in lab accidents. There's no good nor evil. Just a bunch of lab accidents battling it out on green screen.Great CGI.", "amazing.": "It's funny that the genre of superheroics in cinema has finally become a subculture. To understand a new movie, you need to know the plot of a dozen previous ones and it is also desirable to watch TV series and read comics. However, there are still a lot of people fumbling for Marvel, so the money flows like a river and the HYPE lives. The film universe continues to expand and I personally do not remember such a case in the history of cinema.A complex scenario can fit into one movie a lot of characters that should not shade the main character, tons of special effects that were finished up until the last day. Reshoots, improvements - the failure of spidervers would become the swan song of the entire studio. Marvel had a huge responsibility for this movie.

Kinda brought all the fans of the spider world together, much much better than the last. Not that the last one was bad, but just this for me ticked more boxes.

I thought the story was a bit weak seem to be running out of good idea. I like Spider Man but I think it could do with a rest for a couple of years and come back with a good new story line (same for a lot of the same, same Marvel films).

He implores Dr Strange(Cumberbatch, compelling as always) to use his magic to help. And there is an attempt. But there are unintended consequences.If you're not interested in reading an extremely positive review of this, turn back now. I can't believe they actually did it. There's no way(eh?) that this should work. It should end up overstuffed, like Raimi's third entry did. Somehow, the fan service and nostalgia-bait does not overwhelm, and this has a real heart to it. The references are plentiful without ending up obnoxious. They managed to find a way to give the large cast enough character moments and pathos that I wouldn't want a single one of them removed. The balance between drama and comedy is on point. No one just disappears into the background, and this doesn't take away the tragedy of them. The action is big, not excessively so. A few awkward parts barely detract. The long runtime doesn't feel excessive.This features a little strong and suggestive language. If you care even a tiny bit about any fictional being that appears in this, I wholeheartedly recommend you watch it. 6/10.", "incredible and emotional (spoiler free)": "The director was not joking when he said that Spider-Man would be put through things that we never want to see him go through. We see Peter at his all time low during this movie, and it is done flawlessly, much like every aspect of this movie.

But fantastic film on so many levels. The writers of this script were operating on genius level, given the ways they created a script that had a story line all its own that continued the prior Tom Holland Spider-Man movies AND brought together so many elements of the Maguire and Garfield we've already seen AND then weaving in elements of the MCU so seamlessly I didn't realize it happened until I was reflecting on the movie afterward. Very good acting across the board, but Tom Holland and Zendaya knocked it out of the park in the moments that mattered most. Tom Holland made me say \"Wow\" more than once, and Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield brought WAY more to their roles than I anticipated...WAY more. This had me engaged at a level that is pretty rare, and I am not ashamed to say I had tears in my eyes probably half a dozen times, including a very key moment with Garfield's Spider-Man, when he has an opportunity to, in a way, redeem a very specific, tragic moment from his own history.

So it ends up feeling kind of rushed.And as always, Marvel movie stories are only slightly above mediocre. But i guess that's not the focus of the movies anyway.", "Fan Fun But Expected More": "I was pumped for the release of this movie for the main reason that Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina were back in their reprised roles as Green Goblin and Doc Ock. Their superb villainous performances in the 2002 and 2004 films would be next to impossible to beat, so it was great to hear they would be back playing these characters. I was hoping this movie was going to give me a hard-fought epic battle and I would leave the theatre with my breath taken away with this this stacked cast, but that did not happen.The Good:Daredevil's appearance.Bringing back original cast.Every scene with Willem Dafoe.Venom's appearance in a final scene (This is not for everybody).The Bad:I was a bit disappointed with how the multiverse was opened through Doctor Strange all because of an incident with Peter Parker's identity being exposed, but the final straw that drove Peter to go to such extreme measures was the fact his girlfriend and best friend were being denied college admissions for their ties to Spider-Man. I personally preferred how the multiverse was opened in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which felt like more serious and fitting for Kingpin to go to such measures to see his deceased family again. There was too much comedy in this scene, which I felt could have been written with a more serious tone and explored a different way. Seemed kind of silly to go through all that trouble for trivial nonsense, and I would expect better from both Strange and Spider-Man.The battles in this movie kind of fizzle out and lose intensity. After the multiverse opens, the most-intense battle in the movie occurs between Doc Ock and Tom Holland's Spider-Man on the highway because many innocent bystanders are at risk, and Spider-Man is struggling to keep up when simultaneously stopping Ock and saving these people. This fight stops in a moment when Ock lets down his guard when he realizes that this Spider-Man is not his world's Spider-Man then the Stark technology in Spider-Man's suit takes over Ock's suit. Sandman and Electro are fought then captured with this same blueprint: a short battle, letting down their guard, and realizing they were fighting a different Spider-Man. While Spider-Man was battling, Strange captures Lizard and Aunt May points out Goblin when he comes forward for help. These villains' powers felt reduced in these early battles and were captured too quickly considering each took an entire film to take down. Holland's Spider-Man attempts to cure these enemies of their darkness before he sends them back to their world the rest of the movie (Aunt May's brilliant idea). This is basically undoing the emotional deaths we had to endure from the previous films and making Tobey Maguire's and Andrew Garfield's version of Spider-Man look like a jerk for letting them die in the first place. While Holland's Spider-Man is trying to cure these villains, Goblin, Electro, and Sandman have a hard time trusting him and inevitably break free when its Goblin is about to be cured because he was being deceitful the whole time he wanted help (big surprise)... Then an important plot point happens which I will not ruin... This sets up the final fight scene at the Statue of Liberty which feels small because the entire battle does not move from that spot. Holland's Spider-Man gets help from the other versions and it feels like a lot of dodging, distracting, and trying to get each cure to the correct villain. For the final battle, Spider-Man feels underutilized for what he could do if there were three of him and I was hoping that Goblin would drive him to a point where he had no other choice but to kill him. Instead, all the villains are cured, and it feels like everything ends in a tie. I understand that it's Hollands movie, but it felt like Maguire and Garfield's Spider-Man were half-assed and along for the ride during this battle.", "Awesome movie": "The best part of movie is multi-dimensional ploat.Then all spiderman together.

The plot was fine, but not spectacular. Same with the acting, the action and the humor -- all fine. But for this movie to be rated near a 9.0, I would expect all those thing to be top-notch. Perhaps the initial wave of ratings and reviews were written by those who did not know that Maguire and Garfield would also be featured in the film. I can see the shock and frivolity of that reveal providing a ratings boost for a film such as this, which (like most Marvel movies) lacked depth.", "Lazy, contrived, convenient, low effort": "The writing and storytelling are not strong. Plot holes throughout. Established characters behaving out of character. For all the nostalgia and villains crammed into the film, no conflict rates as more than a mild inconvenience.

Then spiderman approaches Dr. Strange and urges him to somehow make few people forget about his identity as a spiderman, but due to a mutually caused mess, Dr. Strange ends up bringing all previous spidermen and their enemies from some parallel universe. Then their is bit of light, funny and bromance scenes between all the 3 spidermen, probably to give the audience nostalgia and a lil laughter before war begins and all spidermen who came from multiverse would ultimately perish.", "Great movie, story feels like rushed.": "Some scenes makes me feel emotional.

Although I am not a critic, I would like to see the film through the eyes of a critic, so my view on the film is this:\nAwful movie. The plot sucked and had awful pacing humour, and dialogue were subpar(like the octopus joke). And they couldn't think of anything better so they brought back some old characters which still didn't save this poorly written film. One bad dialogue scene was when the 3 Spider-Men where making jokes about Tobey's organic webs which was just awkward and humourless. And to add to that, Tobey saying that \"my back\" joke and Norman Osborn repeating \"I'm something of a scientist myself\". Just why?! The film could never decide whether it's a comedy or a dark action movie. This movie certifies that Tom Holland is the worst Spider-Man. With great power comes great responsibilty and MCU Spider-Man lacks that. He's had 6 movies and still acts like an inexperienced, immature, not independent, not smart and acts like a rookie. And the whole plot started because he couldn't think of an alternative to get him and his friends to college so he got Doctor Strange to go and make a spell so that everyone will forget that Peter is Spider-Man(also doing it without his friends consent). And of course with Peter being the doofus he is, he messes up the spell which causes the multiverse to colide. There's a reason why his messes are always cleaned up by someone better than him. One of Spider-Man's best traits is his quick thinking and it was so inevitable that after messing up the spell, he decides to go and talk to the headteacher of the college for a placement(same scene where Doctor Octopus appears). You'd think he would have learnt his lesson about trusting villains in Far From Home but no; he does it again which caused Aunt May's death. It could have been avoided if he had just sent them home, but no they needed to be \"cured\"(which is odd because The Lizard was cured in the Amazing Spider-Man). It just made him look sappy and too Disney like, thinking he can change their fate. It's also not smart to invite dangerous villains into your house with a non superhero family member there. How could he trust them that quickly? When you see it, you find it hard to feel bad for Peter because you're like \"yeah this guy sucks\" The emotional scenes in this movie were pretty awful, especially how long and stretched May's death was and they still tried to exchange jokes and had her standing up right before dying(also re wording Uncle Ben's infamous line which sounded wrong). Family member deaths are always before the character becomes a hero so doing it after feels cheap. It wasn't even basic superhero bad luck, just Spider-Man not thinking straight. Marvel really need new writers(especially in the comedic department), because they've released 4 bad movies this year and a TV show that messed up a timeline just like No Way Home did. And they've also ruined Spider-Man's character by not properly developing him and just throwing him into the Avengers drama. They are cash grabbers and only adding him because he is popular and it will get the movie ticket sales up. Watch Spectacular Spider-Man if you wanna see a better version of a teenger superhero. No Way Home is one of the few movies that make me wish the villains had won, and the reason is that the plot armour on Spider-Man was too strong. Like when geometry was somehow the answer to get out of the mirror dimension. Green Goblin was right about his morality getting the better of him. Overall this movie was just an overhyped, over budgeted nostalgia bait and Spider-Man is the real antagonist of this film. Always puts people in danger for no reason. J. Jonah Jameson was right about him messing things up and being a \"Spider-Menace\". It won't be long till Marvel outmilk him.", "Best Movie of MCU(no spoiler)": "MCU has became kind of boring lately. Especially because they are pretty much always following the same formula. Man, not this one though.Spiderman has just always been a terrifcly written character. No wonder he is the most beloved hero of Marvel but oh boy they always nail the actor playing him.You'll laugh, you'll cry. This movie will make you have goosebumps all throughout the movie.And this one was such a love letter to fans as well.Watch it on theatres. It is so worth it you won't have any regrets.", "Lots of fan service": "Lots of fan service, but not too much, this movie's actually very enjoyable, the plot isn't that complicated, and that's a positive thing, in my opinion.", "Spider man no way home it's the greatest movie i ever seen": "Artistic greatness, directing, visual, audio. Everything in the movie is perfect. It deserves the best movie in the world. I have watched many movies, but this movie is undoubtedly the best.

It quickly became my favourite MCU movie, only dampened by the fact that it is a part one of two.No Way Home has a lot of the same kind of juggling to do, mixing three Spider-Man franchises with Dr. Strange. And when you consider that one of those Spider-Man franchises has two movies that I love even more than the Tom Holland's MCU films and the other has two films that are really terrible, there really is no reason for this vanity project to work. Plus, didn't we see this multi-verse idea play out already in Into the Spider-Verse.And yet it does work...because already have a shared history with these characters and the story we watch unfold is true to that history. It is not unlike like watching Infinity Wars for the first time.But more importantly, No Way Home is a great Spider-Man story. It takes an aspect of Peter Parker's character that really hasn't been thoroughly explored in film- one that fortunately works because all the villains used in the film started off as relatively good people- and, like the best comic book stories, uses this to spin a rich narrative web (pun intended) about reform, redemption and second chances.Sony. Disney. Marvel. Raimi. Webb. (both brought in as consultants) And most of all Watts, Everyone involved in this should be proud of this unlikely accomplishment. No Way Home is a win for all involved.This is hands down one of the MCU's best films. I'd even go as far as to say that it may even be the best.", "Predictably Boring !": "Waited sooo long for this movie to come out and with all the hype I was expecting something way better.. what a let down.....this was definitely geared to millennials12-14 years old.", "Excellent work": "Very good\ud83d\udc4d resyigcufxfuighifkcfurstwiihojofhidtr6fussicutflhjlgifyctugidstidiihcohhgogoh7gucffutufs7rxurwsitighvgks.igdfdufsfjsyarrsyrusuudttdi7td7tdthfxxhfs2ertguxuttsuxursrusaudxgkhcpguphicguitdsryraydwwfuxjgmvxgjvjjvjfsjzfxuf ighgohg.", "Where is the Spider Man in China??!": "To be honest, I don't understand why the film wasn't released in China.

Finally, I really hope that I can really see this film in Chinese cinemas, rather than carefully looking for pirated resources on the Internet.", "Probably the most special experience I have ever had in a theatre": "Where to start?Although I had extremely high expectations before watching the movie, I am so happy to say they have been surpassed. The movie builds upon characters and storylines we have known and loved for years and yet delivers something new and unexpected, while always staying true to what has happened before.Tom Holland absolutely shines in what could surely be his best ever performance yet. All the returning actors from previous Spider-Man outings embody their characters as if they had never stopped playing them.Rarely do you get to experience the range of emotions the movie delivers. I have laughed quite a lot, clapped a lot, and definitely cried a lot, both of sadness and happiness.Although I am left with some questions with regards to conclusion, this is one of the most satisfying movies I have ever seen, mixing nostalgia and novelty with ease.A masterpiece (why not?) and a true love letter to Marvel and Spider-Man in particular.", "A Beginning and an Ending": "In this latest instalment of the Tom Holland, Spider-Man franchise, the Marvel team sticks the landing - something other Spider-Man movies had yet to achieve. With a good helping of fan service as well as expertly crafted storytelling, No Way Home leaves the MCU with a plethora of new beginnings and endings and is sure to impress the most avid web-crawler fans.", "SO GOOD!!!": "Honestly I found myself overwhelmed with joy and anxiety throughout the entire film. A lot of laughs as usual and the end may give your tear ducts a work out but let me just say! Best Spider-Man this far!!!! Make sure you stick around for the after credits!", "Disappointing story": "I found the storyline bland, disappointing, and imaginative. The filming was nice, and the acting was good, but the story and dialogue we're extremely disappointing, it seemed like the writers tried to force the \"second chance\" and good guy story, some of the plot didn't make sense, and the ending was incredibly sad. It could have been such a fantastic movie, but the storyline is just bad.", "Poorly Written Fan Service": "Spider-Man's a fully-fledged member of the Avengers, helped defeat Thanos, and was Tony Stark's protege. We see how lauded Stark was in FFH, and yet Peter instantly becomes public enemy number one on the basis of one dodgy cellphone video? I know superheroes have been contentious within the MCU since Sokovia but something here just didn't add up.Same with the interest in Peter's private life: this is a world with dozens of non-anonymous superheroes, so why would one of them suddenly become such a huge celebrity? Hawkeye can go to a musical about The Avengers and not get hassled, but Peter has news helicopters permanently stationed outside his school? The initial setup felt rushed, arbitrary and out of keeping with the wider MCU, like they needed to get the narrative going asap and didn't have time to set the scene properly or with any kind of nuance.I found the motivation for saving / curing the rogues' gallery super underwhelming. Of course superheroes want to try and save everyone, and May's work at FEAST means she'd be inclined to treat Norman compassionately, but come on. Anyone who's volunteered in that kind of organisation would know that you have to have some kind of threshold for service users' behaviour otherwise things goes sideways immediately. Two of them just tried to murder huge numbers of people! It didn't make sense. Also given that all of this happens (at most) a week or two after FFH, in which Peter needlessly risked the lives of his friends and others by blindly trusting someone he didn't know... you don't think he'd be a little wary of making exactly the same mistake again? Instead he just goes along with it on the basis of some fairly hokey and unconvincing chat from May?The inconsistencies around who gets pulled into the MCU-verse were distracting: why say it's about people who know Peter's identity, then include a bunch of villains who canonically don't know this? I guess the writers had to make it about knowing who Peter was so that they could end up with everyone forgetting him, but being able to see so clearly where the narrative had been welded together took me out of the experience.The beginning of the movie was incredibly rushed. One second Peter and Co are being interrogated and are on the line for serious crimes, including murder. The next scene Murdock is like \"nah u good\" and it's never mentioned again.90% of the film relies on nostalgia. People who weren't attached to the other Spideys are kind of left in the dust. Finally, the idea that \"they're just kids, they always make stupid decisions\" is amplified to the extreme. These are kids who supposedly will be heading to MIT in less than a year, yet everyone dumbs down their decision making to that of a middle school child. Dr. Strange is just \"too smart\" to explain anything to anyone and too weak to stave off spiderman in the mirror dimension. The entire movie relies on compounding mistakes that all bring the direction of the movie to a version of itself so far from it's true potential.", "Good good good good": "Amazing. Very amazing.

The best. Tobey is too old but he can act like a young.", "Literally shaking": "Beat movie I've seen all year. So many pleasant surprises I almost dies of a heart attack . Tobey and Andrew were amazing and William dafoes acting was incredible . 10/10.", "Is it just me...": "Or was Andrew Garfield the best part of this movie? Don't get me wrong, it's a thoroughly entertaining 2.5 hours, but it lacks depth. There's a ton going on in this movie, and and most of it is highly anticipated fan service. Unfortunately, I didn't feel like they connected the dots in a meaningful way. It really felt like what it is-a corporate teamup between two major studios trying to use nostalgia for their previous releases. Character motivations felt flat and hard to identify with, and a lot of their dialogue often felt pretty out of character. Which is a shame considering the incredible potential this film had. I went in expecting this, so I wasn't disappointed, just frustrated when characters did things they wouldn't normally do, clearly for the sake of the plot. It failed to subvert expectations most of the time, often being pretty predictable. If you saw the trailer, you pretty much saw the movie already. But even if you can see what's about to happen, it's still a fun ride, the execution is top notch.Technically, this film is great. The pacing is good, it packs a few well executed surprises, it looks amazing, it sounds great, many of the shots are visually stunning (even if they don't serve much of a purpose), and the performances are top notch across the board. Tobey macguire feels a bit out of place, but Andrew Garfield absolutely steals the movie. I didn't expect the performance he delivered with just a few lines. There was emotion and relatability that you could just feel though the screen. Willem Dafoe, Tom holland, Benedict C., Alfred Molina, Zendaya, Jamie foxx, and the rest of the cast were all stupendous, but I haven't had a role stick with my the way Andrew Garfield's performance did in this movie for a very long time. All I can say about it is I wish they gave him more to do, because he found a new level of depth to bring to this character, and it would have been really cool to have explored that more. The events of the Amazing Spider-Man clearly had a big impact on Garfield's version of Peter Parker, and he embodies that as a new layer of maturity and motivation to do good that just make this version of his Spiderman super compelling. I wish we could see a trilogy of Spider-Man movies featuring this more experienced and complicated version of p.p. That Garfield created for what amounts to only like 10 minutes of screen time in this movie. They gave him a pretty big action set piece that was teased in the trailer, which closed an arc for his character from the amazing Spider-Man movies, and he turns it into the most compelling moment of the movie in my opinion. This movie is worth the watch just for his performance.", "Amazing Fan Service": "No spoilers here. I just wanted to say that this was absolutely amazing. The action starts from the beginning and doesn't disappoint. My favourite marvel film to date. I loved every minute of it. And you if you're a comic book fan, you'll not be disappointed. I'm going to see it again! Best film of the year!", "Masterpiece \ud83d\udd25": "Spiderman: No Way Home is a MASTERPIECE Movie And i will be happy if this film goes to oscar, i like the concept of multi universe the way tom Holland goes to the adventure with his friends i like it , you will enjoy every second The story the Action The Concept Really AwesomeI watched all the Spiderman Movies As i'm the Spiderman fan But this film has a great vibes in my heart and one more thing i will you to please watch all movie of Spiderman to understand this movie perfectlyThere is so much surprises you will love it and i think you will never ever bored while watching movieThank you so much for making this film my childhood hero Spiderman Childhood Memories refreshing film and it is a film that all spidey lover want to see...!!", "For Tobey Maguire": "Normally 1 point but I give 4 points for Tobey Maguire...To me, who grew up with Tobey's Spider-Man movies, Spider-Man movies that come after are just a disgrace. I've never loved these characters, and never will, these stories. Seeing Tobey's Spider-Man universe in this movie just made me happy, other than that everything is still very bad.I wish Spider-Man 4 had continued and Tobey had remained our Spider-Man. Seeing him made me very emotional. We miss you so much. You will always remain real Spider-Man to us.", "A childhood rollercoaster": "This problem started with Peter and his friends applying to MIT but then got rejected because of his revealed identity. Then somehow he went to Dr. Strange to change the course of his reality which ended up backfiring bringing up enemies from other multiverse.This movie is no different to his previous movies which is caused by his foolishness.", "It's average": "It's not really great and isn't much better than the standard marvel movie. The characters aren't great and the jokes cut the emotional moments. It's mostly just a nostalgia bait pulling from other better movies (Ahem Raimi movies). This movie is just some fun but don't expect to take anything out of it except the fact that there will be another.", "Good but not great": "The new Spider-Man movie was good but not great. Too much Sony involvement rather than the newer Marvel feel which was a bit disappointing. This made it feel like the earlier films and to me, detracted from what could have made it great. But other than that it was a decent entry.", "Best Spider Man movies ever made": "Stunning performance and plot, i have no word to this movies. Rollercoaster feeling and plot twist. Like people said \"just watch\". And the ending was good and fresh start to peter as spider man.", "A sitcom movie": "I don't remember the last time I saw such a poor introduction of such important characters. The hole plot is based on a convenient mistake, an error of a sorcerer that was able to see countless futures in previous films. And the introduction of those memorable characters, like it was a sitcom with the laughs beyond. I enjoy the movie of course. But it was just an event film. Totally forgettable.", "The perfect ending to a trilogy": "This movie took everything awesome about Spider-Man and made it even better. They made what many saw as impossible and made it perfect. There's very few things I'd have done differently. But the movie kept me excited consistently throughout the entire film. The introduction to the other two Spider-Man was honestly flawless. They didn't just pop up they showed up with purpose and perfectly timed. The action sequences are better than any of the other films. All I can honestly say is that this movie was perfectly executed.", "Fabulous but the ending :(": "Everything was almost perfect but i hate the endings which finishes with waking up from a dream or erasing memory and everything you gone through is gone. Whatever I never knew I needed a movie like this it was phenomenal!", "MASTERPIECE!": "This is best MCU movie so far! Emotional, darker! I can't find words for describe that I feel! You need to saw it and you will understand my feelings.11/10!", "Waste of Money, Time and (for some) Talent": "Oh my God, where do I begin?1. I liked the idea of Peter wanting Doctor Strange to erase people's memories of forgetting he was Spider-Man, but Ned and Michelle not getting accepted into MIT all because they were his friend was unnecessary.2. Doctor Strange should have kicked Peter out so he can cast the spell properly. I know that him screwing it up due to Peter constantly interrupting the casting is what caused Green Goblin and the other villains to enter his universe, but the fact that this is the reason is dumb.3. How does erasing everyone's memory in Tom! Peter's universe even break the multiverse?4. The writers tried too hard to be funny, and they failed. Big time. The attempted comedy was unamusing, unfunny, childish, and cringeworthy. And too much. It was honestly embarrassing. Oh wait, that's right... Disney bought Marvel in 2009! Duh! No wonder this movie was awful. It was literally a PG-13 Disney movie.5. Ned, Peter and Michelle laughing at Otto Octavius's name. The writers were clearly mocking the character and the (I assume) 'Spider-Man 2' movie itself, and I find that disrespectful.6. I still don't understand why and how Ned got a hold of the magic ring, and then figured out how to create a portal in one day. I know he was trying to tell Doctor Strange about something his nana told him regarding magic, but it all still makes zero sense.7. Each villain somehow wound up in the Holland! Spider-Man universe because they knew Peter was Spider-Man, but Electro ('The Amazing Spider-Man 2') never knew Spider-Man's identity, so he shouldn't have even been in this film.8. What happens after the villains are \"cured\"? Do they return back to the moment they're about to get killed and get killed anyway? Make it make sense!9. Flint didn't die fighting Spider-Man. Him and Peter (Tobey) ended on good terms and parted ways. So why was he in this film?10. Whether Norman had Dissociative Identity Disorder or not is unconfirmed, but he has a mental illness nonetheless, and the way to go about trying to treat it was not written correctly. It was not practical. A(n anti-goblin) serum, really? Guess what? That's not realistic! Why? You cannot kill an alter with chemicals. I can write a whole essay on this number alone.11. I know people feel that Norman and how his alter came about was possibly inspired by the novel \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\", and considering the synopsis of it, I can definitely see that. DID or not, Norman was mentally ill, and he needed psychotherapy. Not a(nother) serum!12. Speaking of Norman, instead of going off of the 2002 screenplay, in my opinion, it appears that everything about 2002! Norman was completely disregarded and he was rewritten just for this movie.13. Instead of Tom's last movie of him as Spider-Man involve him fighting a villain or two that haven't yet been in the previous Spider-Man movies on top of dealing with the world knowing his identity, the writers chose to rely on nostalgia by having three cast members from the 2000s movies reprise their respective roles as well as have them of them say some of their character's most memorable lines. Quite frankly, Andrew, Jamie, and Rhys should not have been in this film.14. This film purposely screamed meme potential with the back-to-back (attempted, awkward and cringeworthy) humor.15. Letting Tobey and Andrew redeem their character by fixing something their character failed to do in the past in Tom's (last) movie was not smart, or fair.16. What exactly were the writers trying to achieve with Peter asking Doctor Strange to cast a spell that will make everyone forget who he is?This film is mediocre at best. As far as acting and acting alone goes, Zendaya was the worst of all. I like the idea of Michelle Jones character inspired by Mary Jane (although I do lowkey wish it was a real redhead with a different name instead of use the same initials), but someone else should have been casted. Someone who genuinely KNOWS how act with their face, voice and body. Zendaya only got casted because of her name and affiliation with Disney and those two reasons only. Elle Fanning would have been a wonderful choice! Or even Laura Harrier - she only was in the first one, and I found her more enjoyable as well as likeable (and more talented) than Zendaya in all three films combined. Michelle had no character development or valid reason for being in this trilogy.I don't want to repeat what other people said on here, so all I will say is this: I bet anything that Willem Dafoe, who, by the way, gave an incredible, spine-chilling performance despite how bloody awful the script and film was, got paid the most. If he chose to not reprise his role, then this film definitely would not have happened. He was a joy to watch! Seeing Alfred Molina reprise his role was nice too. And obviously my OG Tobey!", "Don't go with the trailer!": "Emotional- I have watched all Marvel movies ,older spidermans too,but this one was special.

The use of previous characters and how it weaves them into the story deserves credit.

You won't be disappointed, as it lives a lot by the crowds live-reactions.In general, I have barely seen any movie, that brought a franchise and various fan-bases together that well!But besides the truly awesome fan-service, there were some minor plot holes and a basic plot, that felt a bit random and was built on a not-so-strong basis. Some scenes felt kinda forced, so the main plot can develop in its way and, as well, some logical issues appeared, especially if it comes to certain character appearances and timeline-based events.

Spider-Man No Way Home almost feels more disappointing considering how much potential it had, I felt myself constantly rolling my eyes at the terribly timed \"jokes\" and horrendous script, rising my eyebrows at the questionable editing choices and bad cgi. I did not find myself completely let down with this film so I I will start with positives:The fighting scenes were amazing, they were very intricate and utilised the character's individual abilities at every opportunity which is super fun to watch.Tom holland is a great actor and is really good at playing Peter Parker and Spider-Man, so hopefully in his next movies they don't ruin this with constant call backs to iron man and his gadget's and bad dialogue.I was pleasantly surprised by Zendaya's acting ability and I actually really enjoyed her performance as MJ (don't get why her name can't just be Mary-Jane but whatever), I was afraid she may be a bit too much \"I'm not like other girls\" but she wasn't.MJ and Peter Parker's dynamic was very cute.I loved the old Spider-Men and villains particularly, Dr Octopus, Green Goblin and Electro, yet they were let down many times by the terrible script.I liked all the acting except for Aunt may ( has nothing to do with her looks, I actually like the idea of a younger aunt may she's just not a good actor) and Ned.Ok, now time for the negatives:\nWHY must MCU movies always ruin the moment with an unfunny joke!! This is honestly my biggest complaint. Just stop! They are so forced and out of place. It makes me feel like I can never take what's happening on the screen seriously, every well developed moment is undermined in favour of a cheap joke.The script was uninspiring, with random sprinklings of solid, charming dialogue, getting my hopes up for them to only be diminished. It's like they are dangling a good movie right in front of our eyes only to snatch it away.Not to sound too much like a film snob, but what in gods name was wrong with the editing! It was way too quick then felt unnecessarily endless it was like getting whiplash. The scene transitions were so awkward and even jarring at times.It unfortunately continues the bland colour grading of the MCU, making it strange to see the old characters in this bland world, particularly Andrew Garfield's Amazing Spider-Man who's film's colour palate was vivid and exciting.CGI overload. Not just too much CGI but really bad CGI. No real suits again, really? The lizard looked so bad.Can they go one movie without mentioning Iron man! I will never understand the choice to integrate his character into Spider-Man's story.Forgettable soundtrack per usual of a marvel film, except moment when Raimi soundtrack was playing.Too much fan service forced in.Overall a very mediocre film with a solid core and very promising moments, that are wasted in favour of unoriginality and mass appeal.", "Dull plot and dissappointing end": "A bit dissapointed. Taking into consideration the fact of the multi-verse and the number of amazing characters that they bring back. They could have take much more advantage of it. The plot is very dull the end was very disappointing.", "Best movie experience I've ever had": "I don't like writing long reviews so I will try and keep this brief. This movie is everything I wanted it to be and more. The villains were great, and all the actors were amazing. Obviously the highlight would be Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, he is scary in this movie. He is perfect. Now the scene where Tobey and Andrew appeared I cried tears of joy I was happy and they had the perfect amount of screen time and didn't feel like they just came and went. I think I've spoken too much so I will wrap it up and say that it is the best Marvel movie and possibly one of the best movies.", "Review of the movie Spider-Man": "The movie is very enthusiastic, and acting is no better than the trio, and a very beautiful ending Honestly, this is the best movie of 2021 and I'm excited for all the upcoming parts of the movie.", "Possibly One of the Best Superhero Films Ever!": "Where to start with this one. Quite frankly it was brilliant and amazing and had very few negatives or issues that could be taken from the movie, it is quite simply, a perfectly made superhero movie that just gives the fans and those that follow Marvel the absolute best possible experience by pushing down all the boundaries.First off this is a must watch movie in the theatres. There is a special atmosphere that it delivers, and whilst I usually prefer people be quiet in the cinemas when watching, this movie made everyone that followed or cared about the story and universe; to scream / shout, laugh, become tearful, clap out of pure joy and relief that created an atmosphere amongst strangers that collectively connected the audience. This movie will make you feel all sorts of emotions and has a mixture of scenes that constantly pull on those emotions. The audience all react the same and whilst you don't know those people you get a sense of feeling that you are all in it together and watching this perfect piece of work unfold right in front of your eyes. It is an unreal experience and even after the movie, it is difficult to stop thinking about the movie and the experience you just had.This is a must watch if you follow the genre, please support it so marvel just keep doing this as they absolutely nailed it. Anyone giving this a low score just does not understand a good movie or is either overly critical or simply not a fan of this genre. Alternatively, giving this movie a score of 9 or lower would mean that all other movie scores should be downgraded another 2 or 3 stars as it is extremely difficult to find another movie of this quality and amazement. It just hasn't really been done before and this movie just created history as a world first.", "The best film I have ever seen": "This film is undeniably a masterpiece, besides the obvious fan service (which was amazing) it manages to be a beautifully crafted piece of media with compelling moments and characters that have great depth to them.

The positive and negative things are pretty clear to me and that's why it was so hard to decide where to put this just now.

It's hard to believe that there would be another MCU entry that could rival the fan service stuff that Avengers: Endgame (2019) delivered, but somehow they did it. Because they don't just put MCU stuff in here, it's characters from all kinds of Spider-Man franchises. I often had flashbacks to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), but whether I would call that recycling or whatever, I'm not sure. But man was it great to see Doc Oc, Green Goblin and all those other villains we know and for the most part love once again, portrayed by the exact same actors. It's almost a bit much at first to see them all here interacting with each other, but I think they handle the characters decently well so that things don't become too messy. If you want to talk about the characters in more depth though, things don't look so pretty unfortunately, but more on that later. The multiple versions of Spider-Man are the highlight of course. I mean Andrew Garfield is fine, no real hate from me here, but man was I stoked to see Tobey Maguire back in the suit. I mean the guy is on his way to be 50 years old and yet I still see him as the same guy that entertained me throughout my childhood. It's truly magical and I'm so glad we are able to experience things like that in our current time. The Spider-Men have very solid chemistry with them cracking jokes left and right but also sharing their pain and whatnot. They all lost something but have to move on, and our MCU Spider-Man is currently going through that lesson. But again to really stress it thoroughly, these guys are funny as hell. I would watch a sitcom with them like right now, that's how entertaining they were while being with one another or even just with some of the other characters from the movie. I especially love things like them talking about the web physics of 2000s Spider-Man you know, it's good stuff. It's awesome to see the different suits represented here too, and I like the changes to Electro for example, where they made him more like he looks in the comics. In general, the villains do look just like in the movies they were taken from though, so no complaints at all from me. The acting is also excellent, with Willem Dafoe as an easy standout. They don't try anything too fancy with these guys, Electro is like he always is for example, but I like the stuff they try out like giving Doc Oc the control over his arms back.The special effects are topnotch and so is the music. This is a fairly long movie, but the action sequences are well spread out and are memorable in their respective ways. The final showdown is just the stuff of dreams with our heroes teaming up to fight a bunch of bad guys, it's big and once again fan service to its fullest extent. I also enjoyed seeing more of Doctor Strange like I always do and I'm already very excited for his next installment that is coming out soon. I will say though, I have my gripes with him inside this story even if he isn't the worst part by any means. And I guess we can talk about who that would be now.Spider-Man is of course very stressed out at the beginning and I dig what they did with the stuff coming right after the previous entry. I can accept Peter's request of making everyone forget his secret identity, I mean he would still have friends and family so what's there to lose really ? But when he literally constantly interrupts Strange while performing a spell to fix that issue, it may be funny for the moment, sure, but it's not like I expected the whole story to be based upon that, you know. But after being told the consequences by Strange, things are very clear and definitely fixable. Yet when they are ready to fix it, Peter once again has something to say about it. And I wouldn't expect him to make the biggest mistake of his life right after doing that in his previous installment, but there he went and did it anyway. I can't put into words how frustrated I was by that decision, to have him literally steal the box from Strange and try to give all these guys a \"second chance\". It is fate, Strange is right, and we shouldn't interfere with it. But oh well, here we are watching Spider-Man defeat Strange with Maths like a boss. And by the end, Strange is totally cool with it. Sure, he is a little bit pissed but that is it. It's like he was trying to teach Peter a lesson like this was The Fairly OddParents or something. And going back to when Peter has Strange locked up and the box secured, why exactly is he so sure that they just have to press that thing into the box and the spell will be done ? How does he know it doesn't need Strange to be present or even doing it himself ? Whatever, I'm definitely not reading too much into this though as these are very apparent issues. When Peter's plan goes sideways again, why doesn't he call MJ to press the thing into the box ? Sure, he is fighting for most of the time but still, that could have fixed it. I know he's desperately trying to give these guys a second chance but when it's their turn to have a fourth or fifth one, you will start to question Peter's reasoning you know. And seeing May die as a result of this stupidity is so unbelievably unnecessary. No, her saying the famous Spider-Man quote doesn't help in the slightest, quite the opposite in fact. I love the fan service as I mentioned in detail before, but even that does become a bit much at times, with this probably being the best and worst example for it if you know what I mean. It feels so forced and pretentious, which therefore makes the scene not even remotely sad or emotionally powerful in my eyes, which is just a shame and wasted opportunity if I have ever seen one. This isn't the way I wanted to say goodbye to this character, but I guess it's what I have to roll with. The scene with Happy at May's grave right before the credits roll is bittersweet, but I still would have preferred something else. I mean the scene in which Spider-Man 2 gets stabbed by Osborn (even if predictable) was more powerful in my eyes, and that guy doesn't even die, he literally jokes around with Spider-Man 3 a few seconds later. Speaking of though, I also found it weird that Spider-Man 1 wanted to kill Osborn so badly. I get what he went through but like Osborn said, it was his fault. And roasts aside, I actually though the talk Spider-Man 2 gave him earlier about killing the murderer of his uncle and not feeling better afterwards would have done something but no, Spider-Man 1 just wants to kill that guy so there he goes. Dafoe's acting in that scene especially is superb as I have mentioned before and the moment where Spider-Man 2 stops Spider-Man 1 from killing Osborn was somewhat sweet I guess, but it's pretty unnecessary and once again feels forced. I mean with the multiverse stuff and all that, you could say that not every single version of Spider-Man out there has this non-killing philosophy that we have come to know over the years, but well it is what we know like I just said, so you can't really expect us to accept one version of him being a murderer all of a sudden now. It's not cold blooded or anything, but what is revenge going to give him ? Nothing. And to think that it took Spider-Man 2's near death for Spider-Man 1 to realise that is more than silly. A sweet thing I have to mention before I forget it though is when Spider-Man 3 catches MJ and has immediate flashbacks to the traumatic incident in which he couldn't save his own MJ a few years prior. It was almost funny I guess, maybe because the Amazing Spider-Man films are so goofy, but I liked that. I also liked when one of the other Spider-Men calls Spider-Man 3 amazing, and I think Spider-Man 2's regular outfit being roasted was hilarious, like most interactions with him. The chemistry between MCU Peter and MJ definitely improved since his last installment, but they still aren't quite there in my eyes. I could believe it now, even if it is broken up at the very end anyway. It's the spirit that counts, right ?I guess at the end of the day, I'm just sad that there are such a number of issues to be held against the good stuff, because there are some really impressive things in here. The scene in the mirror dimension is just what I want to see when thinking about Doctor Strange, the scenes with Wong are fun like they are most of the time and when you accept the stupid decisions Spider-Man 1 makes, they actually handle the story very well. It's just when you think about the fact that all of it wouldn't have needed to happen if Spider-Man 1 simply wasn't supid and finally learned from his past mistakes, that it becomes a pretty silly main story for your film. I know it needs to happen for the movie to happen, but at some point you start to become unreasonable with your desire to have a certain story take place. \"It's the right thing to do\" bla bla bla, I mean what is Strange thinking when Peter tells him those lines over and over again ? Did no one on set think that Peter was unreasonably stupid in this film ? Or was that just an accepted fact and they had to roll with it because that was the only way the story would work ? I don't know, all I know is that someone messed up pretty badly and that this sadly wasn't quite what I had hoped for. A visual spectacle ? Absolutely, but it's lacking any emotional depth despite trying hard on several occasions and even the strongest point in the fan service can be a bit much from time to time. I enjoyed my time in the theatre for the most part, but the problems stayed in my mind far longer than the impressive CGI did, which is probably why I had to get so much off my chest just now. I really wanted to like this, but I just couldn't justify a higher rating.", "For the fans": "If you're a spider fan then this is a great conclusion to this series. Starting out the movie felt a bit slow but as soon as it picks up, it doesn't slow down. After the basic intro it's like a rollercoaster ride and In an instant you're at the end. Overall nice conclusion and possibilities for the next series and arc of the SpiderMan.", "One of the best...": "Literally you could not ask for more from a film... it gets you emotional, excited; you laugh, cry, cheer and jump in your seat with suspense!!So well done.

But after the movie... god damn was it great. The villains were great, the return of some of the best spider-man villians where amazing and they are making room for new ones like Venom who is now part of the MCU! Also, how they managed to keep Tobey and Andrew a secret was amazing. The movie was emotional, exciting, suspenseful and just PURE fan service. Not to mention the Daredevil cameo and the post credit cutscenes. Which you have to experience yourself ;)It's great that Tom's journey as the webslinger is far from over. Not to mention the room for characters like Ghost Spider and Miles Morales.

The acting is great both Tom, Zendaya, BC and all the supporting cast, including one of the best villains in the MCU (Loki territory), it seems like that almost anything Jon Favreau touches is good.Enough chit chat.

This movie took every expectation I had and threw out the window. I felt so many emotions during this. Me and my friend cried a couple times, we laughed a lot. The amount of references to other movies were amazing. The credits were amazing, they had me in awe the animation was stunning and mesmerizing. The visual effects team was amazing, they made so many amazing and visually pleasing scenes. So over all I would have to say that this movie has now made its place onto my top three marvel movies of all time.", "Best marvel movie ever": "It is a very good movie actually one of the best that i saw the day it is released in and in cinema and had that amount of fun so i really recommend that you go see it as soon as possible before it is spoiled for you.", "BEST MARVEL MOVIE EVER": "Amazing.

It's like when Thor joins the battlefield in Infinity war but a whole movie .... Well sorry for not fan-girling over cliche reveals and fanfare music....", "Its as good as people say it is!": "I personally like Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse more but this was a blast of a film. Now at first I rolled my eyes at the trailers it looked so stupid so coming into the theaters I was expecting a not good but fun movie. Instead I got a fun and great movie. The action was also very entertaining and fun there was only one action scene I didn't like and thats the scene when sandman and electro fight in the woods it looks really bad and rubbery. It kind remind me of the original Spider-man's action and that looked so bad! Also The Story all over the place, Now this can work Spider-Verse is my favorite spider-man movie and the story is confusing except the movie i supposed to feel like insanity because we see all the villains early in no way home the villains are introduced in the 1 hour mark. And the villains weren't that much of a threat Dr Octopus is poorly developed, The Lizard doesn't have any importance to the story, Sandman was ok, Electro was funny but the villain who steals the show is oddly the Green Goblin yeah the guy I used to laugh at in the original Spider-Man. He probably read my notes because he is terrifying in this movie I heard a baby cry during the fight with peter. Oh and about that action scene it my favorite in the movie I think the goblins demeanor is terrifying while he messed up! The scene when aunt may died was a huge risk for the MCU that Im glad they took and It was heartbreaking. Any way I will give this film a solid A Its really good.", "Mass movie": "Good movie\nComedy,thrilling ,\nWhenever I think of Spider-Man, I think of this film!!!Spider-Man is my all time favourite Marvel character!Everything about this film feels right in my opinion.From the amazing casting, the action set pieces, the practical effects, the story, the emotion and the overall tone of the film!!Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man!He looks the part I think and you believe him as this character.I've actually always been able to relate to this version of Spider-Man to be honest.Whenever I watch this film, I always imagine myself as Spider-Man himself!This film does a brilliant job at placing you in the Spidey suit, so to speak!!It makes you think how you would be if you got these special abilities!!!The transformation scene is always great to watch in my opinion because it always makes me feel like I am in the film: scaling the walls, jumping between buildings and figuring out how to shoot webs!!Tobey manages to capture the nerdy side of Peter, the humour, the awkwardness and the vulnerable side too!You really root for him to be honest.You actually care about him and those he cares about!You can connect with him!Whenever I think of Spider-Man, I always come back to Tobey Maguire!Kirsten Dunst is cast well as Mary Jane.I think she looks the part and she has great chemistry with Maguire too!James Franco is great as Harry Osborn.It's funny how similar he looks to Willem Dafoe in this film!!!Speaking of whom, Willem Dafoe is fantastic as the Green Goblin!A truly great and memorable performance of one of my favourite Spider-Man villains!He really owns it in this role to be honest!He's entertaining, menacing, funny, creepy and even scary!!The scenes where he is talking to himself deserve more praise I think!The scenes with him and Maguire are also great too!I honestly cannot think of anyone else who could play this role like Dafoe!However I'm still not keen on the suit design though...\nLooks a lot like a Power Ranger to be honest!It's not necessarily distracting but the suit could have been better I think!Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson are fantastic as Aunt May and Uncle Ben.By far my favourite versions of the characters!!This is how Aunt May and Uncle Ben should be in my opinion?The 'With great power comes great responsibility' speech is still really inspiring to be honest!!!It still hits me even now!!JK Simmons is perfectly cast as J Jonah Jameson!!He steals every scene he is in!I honestly cannot imagine anyone else playing this character!Overall this is a truly fantastic superhero film that still feels relatable and fresh!I still love the Spidey suit too!The film is very suspenseful and you feel the stakes throughout!Danny Elfman gives a truly fantastic music score too!One of the best scores in cinema history in my opinion!!The film is full of some really memorable and iconic moments and shots!!!The action is handled very well I think.It's actually rather brutal at times to be honest!Especially towards the end!Peter gets his arse kicked a lot in this film!The film is surprisingly really emotional too.You really care about certain characters and the film does a great job with blending the emotional aspects of the film, with the overall superhero tone!This is Spider-Man!!!!", "BEST MOVIE": "The things I would do to be able to rewatch this movie. It exceeded my expectations... Please do not spoil for the people who have not seen it yet. Actually in love with everyone's character!", "The movie is great": "The day before, the whole family visited this picture. The sons really liked it. My wife and I were delighted. Realistic special effects, I haven't seen such a good works by artists for a long time. We also appreciated the plot of foreign directors, thought there would be only fiction, but the producers also raised other topics of concern to society. I appreciated the deep meaning of courage and strong spirit that unites heroes in a difficult life situation. This film will also be appreciated by the female sex, as a melodrama was introduced into the script. My wife just cried, barely calmed me down, but the main thing is that the whole family was indescribable delighted. After watching, I found out that there are other parts, and I was happy to watch them instead with my whole family. I like it a lot! We look forward to the next part !!!", "Very very very good": "Spider-Man is one of my favorite superheroes, so I still found time to get out to the cinema. According to the plot, Parker's life became complicated after the disclosure of the secret of his identity. Someone considers him a hero, and someone is almost the most important villain. This harms not only Peter, but also his loved ones. To fix everything, he decided to resort to the help of a famous magician... The plot is very interesting. I was sitting in the cinema just with my mouth open. The cast is just super. Kambebratch plays the role of mentor. And he handled it pretty well. I also liked the graphics of the film. In general, the movie is worth watching, must-see for Marvel fans. The film gave food for thought and analysis. I advise you!", "Cool film for fun's": "We all know about parallel universes that we heard from science fiction writers and theoretical physicists, where our twins may well be, who live their own lives, which can either coincide with ours or differ in details. I think many people would like to meet themselves and talk heart to heart. An interesting realization was found in this film.An attempt to get into the multiverse ended with the fact that the creatures from it crawled into the world of the hero. But the most interesting thing is that they are all familiar to us, we met them a long time ago in another Universe, of course, on the scale of films. A pleasant feeling of nostalgia appeared at the sight of our old heroes performed by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, our hero was not alone. But not only doppelgangers of our hero penetrated into his Universe, but also some antagonists of the old spiders penetrated here and made a commotion.The most interesting thing is that the creators of the old films about spiders clearly did not plan that their heroes would meet someday, and this gave rise to many funny situations and funny moments when one spider-man's web is thrown out by itself, while others do not understand how this is possible. Or when the villains wonder why the spider is a little different. This is how the battle with evil entered the multiverse level.The friends of the current Spider-Man also pleased. I like Zendaya's current Mary Jane. I consider one of the best girls Peter Parker in all films. Only Gwen Stacy, played by Emma Stone, who played in the previous Spider-Man, was comparable. She also really liked her role.In any case, I thank the film for a pleasant feeling of nostalgia, because I watched all the films about Spider-Man in the year of their release and did not review everything later. So it was nice to remember the forgotten heroes from old films. I would be glad to see more of them, but then you need to make more than one film. So the film is suitable for viewing by everyone who has watched all the films about the adventures of the spider in the past.", "All time best superhero movie of all time": "From starting to the ending im just saying OMG for every scene Except aunt may death scene\nI hope this Movie is going to break all previous superhero movie records.", "Exploration of Villains, does Hero script his own Story.": "The Spiderman movies have always been a great way to break away from reality. Disney's ability to explore different ages of the hero over the years has been very good. Sometimes the content is a little easy to predict, but again, the limitations on having a much broader age gap , some things must be addressed. But when reading the Marvel comics ; the labours of the hero being conveyed, only to not prevail would be too much of a break from the content. This is a good story, The initial plot and how it followed was really lovely, some more focus on Peter as a person as in what he does for work, flash back to adult, collage or teen life, his emotional connections to science, little projects etc.The other theme was incredibly interesting with regards to how the theme of evil, villains are characterized and explored. Some prior knowledge is assumed and also required in order for the film to clearly continue through the stages. Also, Disney enjoyment of showing us the golden nostalgic moments should not be dwelled on too much, as it shall end up diluting the characters and suddenly, they become interchangeable.But still a good all round fun film for those who want and easy watch and enough links in to the Marvel universes to make alot of fans very pleased indeed. Well done to the cast and crew great work.", "Couldn't meet the expectations/hypes": "This movie competed with south Indian classics , i can't belive it !

One with a convoluted story that is, at best, hard to follow, and at its worst, BLOATED with fan service of the cheapest kind. This movie tried very hard to be nostalgic and emotional and totally fell flat on its face. Emotional scenes were well acted but with no contextual weight. The rest of the acting in this was a total campfest. There were some humorous moments but not nearly enough to give this movie a second star. I know marvel fans love anything that comes out even if its horrible, so this review is for people who actually are interested in formulating their own opinions instead of denying a movie is bad because youve been sweating in your sleep about it since the first trailer dropped.", "GOOD BUT NO MOGUS REFERENC": "Dis iz exact reson why Gru vs Bobuc Man is much better.

The whole plot shouldn't work, but it does work.A lot of fun and opportunity for the character arc to progress in the MCU in Spider-Man 4 and 5.My only niggle is that the main plot for Doctor Strange's spell was bundled together at the end making his entire presence and existence erased. The whole point of the spell was for people to forget Peter was Spider-Man NOT his entire existence altogether.In my opinion, they didn't need to do that for the story to work.", "Fun if you love Spider-Man": "This is a Disney Spider-Man movie . It has the same pacing, visual style, comedic style, and dialogue that we are used to from all of the Avengers movies.What sets this movie apart is it's ability to go all in with the call backs and references. It has no shame and that actually made the movie surprisingly fun. Just seeing how many references and call backs they can fit into a single set piece.This isn't for new fans of Marvel or Spider-Man it's for the old ones. If you are lucky enough to love everything Spider-Man you'll have a blast watching all your favorite characters talking like it's a reunion show.For those looking for an engaging, interesting, or well thought out story or dialogue, this might not be the best place to look.

Everyone said no spoilers and everyone was so rushed into getting tickets for the premier.I watched it because a friend invited me to see it so I said \"okay sure let's watch it\" and also cause I'm a huge fan of Tobey and Andrew and I had hopes that they would really appear or something.We start as the last Spider-Man film ended with Misterio revealing Spider-Man's true identity and everyone starts complaining that Spider-Man killed a savior of the world because of the daily bugle fake news. So Peter and their friends get rejected from MIT because he is Spider-Man and their friends are Spider-Man's friends.So Peter goes to doctor strange the most powerful wizard in the universe which is now a complete looser. So they Peter starts being stupid and doesn't allow Strange to complete the spell in which everyone should forget who Peter parker was.This causes a problem in the universe and suddenly the bad guys start popping out. They fight and then Dr Octopus realices he is not the Spider-Man of his universe but as all these movies revolve around Tony Stark, Spider-Man can now control Doc Ocks arms because Stark Tech. So then more villains appear and it's more blah blah blah. All this way through the movie I was already bored.So now after all the villains appear... Peter confronts strange and steals a magic box which can return all the enemies to their worlds but Peter decides they can be good because they are misunderstood. So he defeats the most powerful wizard by using math and locking him somewhere...\nSo he gives his no funny friend Ned the ring to open portals. And this boring MJ the magic box and frees the villains with the hopes they will be good and somehow renounce to their powers... so using stark tech they manage to fix doctor octopus and he regains control of his mechanical arms. So I guess Sam Rami's Spider-Man and octopus are just stupid cause Tom Hollands Spider-Man manage to fix this idiot in just a few minutes. So obviously you won't guess what happens next... yeh the other villains refuse and they kick the living **** out of Spidey and kill his aunt... cause she tries to fight green goblin? Man... okay\nSo then it comes the part we've all waited for the big reveal. We have MJ and this guy Ned having some sweet bread and then this Ned guy opens a portal and Andrew Garfield appears... ah joy! And then after some dumb Disney-Marvel jokes Tobey Maguire appears.So... what bothers me here is why! Why this entrence to these beloved characters this part instead of being epic is just an introduction with no soul... nothing special... they could have a better way to introduce Tobey and Andrew than this. But okay whatever.So our hero Tom Holland is crying and this guys appear and start talking about their failures and why Tom Holland shouldn't be focusing on their rage. So they plan to fix this bad guys with some crazy meds and that's it I guess... they go to a lab... and fix Ebola by crafting some crazy vaccines... so Tom Holland FaceTimes the world and tells that he'll be waiting at the Statue of Liberty which now has a captain America shield which is dumb but ok... so this is the kill box here is where they'll confront all these vicious enemies...\nSo the villains start appearing and well the three Spider-Man's don't communicate properly and they mess up until Tom Holland says \"hey guys have you seen avengers?\" So they team work and defeat this bad guys in the most rushed and boring fight I've ever seen they fix everyone and Dr Strange appears and sees Peter was right and the villains could be fixed... so green goblin appears and Tom Holland kicks the living **** out of him... at the point that he is about to kill him but Tobey stops him because that's not the spidey way... so Green Goblin stabs Tobey and I was like \"Okay that was unexpected\" but I thought he was gonna die or something... but this scene is so stupid because they make a lot of drama and the kid Next to me was about to cry. And everyone was so sad... but make a guess it's a Disney-Marvel movie obviously they wouldn't kill anyone here so... suddenly Tobey which looked like he was about to die stands up and says a dumb line like \"I get stabbed a lot\" and I was like \"what the hell\" so supreme wizard starts messing the multiverse and the only way to fix it is by doing the spell in which everyone would forget who Peter Parker was... so he does that and well the lamest goodbye between the Spider-Men and the villains they just vanish... and I guess that's it for the expected multiverse... so everyone forgets who Peter Parker is he tries to talk to MJ but then he doesn't do it. Because now he realizes that without him... her ex girlfriend and his ex best friend are having their dreams come true of being part of MIT.So our hero moves to an apartment and knits a new original suit and goes out to save us.And that's the end...\nI just don't understand why are people saying this film is the best Spider-Man film as I said I believe the character introduction was pretty lame... and the final fight seen was at some point even boring... it's a good spidey flick but nothing out of this world. I was expecting Andrew or Tobey to appear with some epic music while maybe Tom Holland was under attack they would appear to support him... not this intro...\nBut well maybe I ask to much. I liked it but as my review says it's just okay. Maybe I'm just old or had high hopes because of all the hype they were building.", "Absolutely brilliant, but it won't be if you missed the rest of the MCU!": "SPOILER FREE REVIEWThis is truly an amazing movie, a viewing experience beyond what any conventional movie can ever offer. However, there are about 30 movies you need to have seen to get the full picture. Not having seen them prior to seeing this is EXACTLY like watching the final episode of season 10 in some random series and expecting to follow along. After seeing so many bad reviews of Avengers Endgame by people that obviously have not seen the complete story, I think it should be said that you need to follow the MCU to properly enjoy this movie.", "Giving the fans what they want": "The movie has so much hype that I was worried it wouldn't live up but it did. Interesting story line with tons of Easter eggs. There were several nods to comic fans along with leaving the door open to future story lines. Even though some fans theories were proven to be true, it didn't diminish the experience. True Spidey fans will love it.", "Spider-Man: No Way This Plot Is Going To Make Sense": "Dont get me wrong, this is a very entertaining movie.That said, it has a lot of issues which hurts the overall viewing experience.The biggest problem for me is that the plot makes no sense when you think about it for too long - especially the ending.Many of the big events are forced to create awsome moments, but this hurts the overall story of the film and the dialogue, which is nowhere near as well crafted as in the two prior films.I understand the people who love this film. I just did not enjoy it nearly as much as i did with the first two.It felt more like a big fan service film, than a actual movie with a plot. I have to say that i was disappointed, but i think that is due to the fact that i loved the other Tom Holland Spiderman movies so much.Have a nice day everyone who is reading this - sry for bad english:)", "This was an amazing experience!!": "If you got spoiled like I did, the movie is still 100% worth it. The interaction alone is award worthy. I'd recommend you watch it in IMAX, nothing else compares to the sound and visuals of IMAX.", "I'm trying really hard to like it as much as I want to": "Was it good? Yes. Was it great? No. I read so many people talk about the villains having so much depth in this film but honestly I disagree, that depth was already handed to us in previous films. Do I like the villains? Sure I did but it wasn't anything new nor cutting edge. The big moment we all expected to happen was laid on in the most odd and cheeses fashion that it was almost the nail in the coffin saying that this movie was dreadful. It's saving grace was the dialog between them when they finally meet even if parts were thick! All in all it was great popcorn fun and I'm sure many will enjoy this, yo mich rehashing foe me to call it great bit as far as cash grabs go this was one of the better ones.", "This is the only review that matters": "It's real simple. This is the kind of movie that 25-30 years from now we will all show our kids/grandkids/whoever is special to us because that's just what it is, SPECIAL. There are some \"negative\" reviews and I will say a lot of them are just typical people not being able to appreciate GREATNESS. What a film!", "Didn't feel like a Marvel Movie": "This movie felt and looked very much like a Sony pictures movie and not in the vein of the MCU. Kind of felt like a nostalgia grab and a chance for Sony to shove as many potential properties and sequels in as possible to ride the coattails of the MCU. Not really a very satisfying end to the trilogy.", "Excellent but still...": "Although this movie is my favorite spiderman movie, it lacks imagination and it is actually quit predictable. Could have made more as far as the fighting scenes are concerned. Overall really good!!!", "MY OH MY!!": "P-U-R-E J-O-Y!!! Looks like the've got the playbook of how to make great entertaiment and all I cam feel now is an Emotional rollercoaster and I don't know...I want to see more of it.", "This movie fulfilled my long pending wish": "Always wanted to watch tobey Maguire as spiderman again. He as spiderman was my childhood superhero. Never thought my wish would get fulfilled.... All in all a great watch simply loved it.", "Great but relies on nostalgia.": "One of the best Spider-Man movies, Spider-Man 2 still being the best tho. The plot is good in some parts and lazy in others, but the strongest scenes are worth spending two and a half hours.", "Wow. Wow. Wow.": "Everything I could have hoped for! They did such a great job! And some pretty amazing insider jokes (like the back pain joke \ud83d\ude02). Best Spider-Man movie ever!", "Amazingly Overrated and Troublesome": "If you think this is the best Spider-Man, your opinion is bad, and you should feel bad.This is a movie about a problem which was entirely of the protagonist's creation. While many movies do follow that format (i.e. Age of Ultron), it makes for a much more shallow superhero movie.I can always go back and watch any of the previous Spider-Man films and enjoy them unchanged, but I will always be forced to think about what this movie has done to them. One of the main plots was to redeem the previous villains, but all it did was tarnish them. Villains are villains for a reason, and while redeeming them is a nice Hallmark moment, it doesn't belong here. The fact that Holland's Peter Parker was caring enough and capable enough to fix these villains makes Maguire's and Garfield's versions seem dumb and incapable in comparison. We know that they are not less capable, and are far less idealistic and ignorant. Idealism and ignorance should not be treated as an asset to Holland's Spider-Man. Holland's Aunt May ultimately does because of it, but the movie still rewards his faith in helping villains.There is a time and a place for the redemption of certain villains. Doc Oc, Sandman, and Harry Osborn were mostly redeemed already in the Maguire franchise. Maguire's and Garfield's Spider-Man tried to help the villains whenever possible. Those that died as villains, should've returned as villains, and stayed villains. The Hallmark treatment doesn't fit here. Imagine if at the end of The Dark Knight, Joker saw the error of his ways and turned over a new leaf; that would be a sucky ending.Furthermore, almost all these villains were pulled from their universes at the time of their deaths. The movie never explains how fixing them in Holland's universe and sending them back would allow them to avoid that fate. Logic would hold that they'd be sent back to exactly when they were pulled from their universe, or after, but not before.Much like the villains, this movie ruined Maguire's Spider-Man, and to a lesser extent Garfield's. What the previous generations of Spider-Mans got right, that Marvel can not seem to do, is create a real sense of danger, risk, and urgency. Both Maguire's and Garfield's Spider-Man had humor in it, but it was well-timed and places humor. They were never in the final fight where there were serious odds, and still cracking jokes and acting carefree. Like many, I was so excited to see MY Spider-Man on screen again, the Spider-Man I grew up with, and the first superhero movie I ever saw in theaters, Tobey Maguire's, but what I saw in No Way Home was not that Spider-Man.The last trailer for the movie made it look like the two previous Spider-Mans appeared at the very end. While that would've meant less screentime for Maguire and Garfield, it still would've been a far better movie and better ending to have them come in and help defeat all the villains, who at that point had overpowered Holland's, at the last minute right when all hope seemed lost. No bullcrap redemption, no dumb humor, no group therapy session, just good old fashioned good vs evil.", "greatest spider-man movie": "I think this movie was phenomenal. As a spider-man fan it did not let me down in any way and actually fulfilled its purpose. The character entrances made the crowd get up on their feet along with scenes that made us reach for the tissues. It didn't let loose of any detail in the previous films and the directors and writers really listened to the fans this time and ended up with a movie that left us feeling like we were watching endgame all over again.", "This is the best Spider-Man movie I have ever seen": "I took the first show and all fans clapped hand over 20 times, even at the last easter egg. It made me laugh, cry, scream, wave by wave throughout the movie. My heartbeat was still at climax when I left the theater. I can tell this is the best SM movie among all 8 episodes !", "Thats what Spiderman should be": "Yeah,short review coming. This movie is the best mcu film by far. This is just the beginning and you feel it on the end. Jon Watts is growing as a great director. Im really excited to see his coming works. This is a epic,full of action and emotion,most importantly full with the heart of spiderman film. Watch it then you want more,as it suppost to,you know this mcu stuff is all about wanting and wandering. They did this good on this one.", "Messy concept but brilliant execution": "The concept that could only become a giant mess - 3 heroes and 5 and half villains - somehow ended up working extremely well. Very well balanced screen time between all of the characters, with respect to which of them are the fan favorites. Malino and Dafoe rightfully get the most out of the villains. The respect and tributes given to the old movies is heartwarming and also well balanced. Of course, if you watched (and didn't completely hate) Maguire and Garfield's movies, you'll enjoy the many little references a lot more but the movie will work for fans of just the MCU just fine. It still feels very much like a MCU movie and Holland is still the main character. Just as it should be. Now why 10? Well, I wouldn't rate a comedy on the drama and narrative, I'd rate it on its jokes and whether it made me laugh. Likewise, I wouldn't say that The Shawshank Redemption sucks because it didn't make me laugh. Well, at this point Marvel have made their own genre in the MCU films. So I'm rating it as that. On the comic book nerdiness, World class CGI action and the corny humour. Not without a few minor plot holes but nothing bad enough to bring it down to 9. It delivers everything you want in a MCU film and is easily in the top 3 of best MCU movies ever, along side Thor: Ragnarok, and so deserves the 10..", "A mind-blowing Spyder world": "This review is written just after watching the movie literally I am writing it out side the theater gate.The movie has all the elements of a excellent movie it has drama, suspence, all the villan and all the heroes this move bigger than End Game, my this statement explain all. Go and watch it now.", "This film doesn't deserve its current rank": "Now, Spider-Man: No Way Home has the 18th position in the top 250. I think that's wrong. Come on, this film doesn't have an interesting idea or even a cool story, because the filmmakers didn't have the goal of creating something like that. They just wanted to bring a lot of iconic characters to the movie. So they did it and they did it nicely, but that's all.This film reminds me Terminator: Dark Fate. In Terminator, the only goal was to involve Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton in the movie. And everyone agrees that the film turned out to be just a banal attraction without an interesting script.For me, Spider-Man is almost the same, just much better in all respects.It was nice. I did not regret going to the cinema. The cast was amazing... But it's still a film without an idea, which doesn't deserve its 18th position.P. S. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has the 19th position. I hope this will change soon.", "TEARY-EYED NOSTALGIA": "I can't even write a long paragraph about this movie because the emotions I felt during this movie are impossible to explain. If you are a fan of previous spider man's you will absolutely adore this movie. All the complaints about Tom hollands Spider-Man are handled so well in this movie that it changed my whole perception of how I viewed his spider man and made him one of my favorite spider man's that is easily just as good as Tobey and Andrew's. I got teary eyed for many scenes and left feeling hopeful and optimistic aboht our world as a whole. I'm not a huge MCU fan but one thing I've noticed is that when there movies are on point, they give great messages about hope in the universe and make you want to be a better person. This movie delivers on all fronts and is easily a 10/10 movie IMHO.", "I'm not mad": "As someone who grew up with the other Spider-Man(s) this really hit the spot. The endless remakes do get tiring but the self-aware comedy that has risen from the ashes is completely worth it. I could have watched two and a half hours of just the Spider-Man (s) hanging out, honestly the rest of the movie is background noise. This is a comedy (with a lot of action scenes that we've already seen 100 times in the way). Also I can't be the only person who can't summon an ounce of care any time anyone dies in this series. Oh no are they dead or just coming back thru magic in the next movie, making every death essentially pointless. This is the perfect movie to get your millennial aunt to watch a marvel movie with you, and have her actually enjoy it.", "the best movie": "I cried the whole movie i wasn't especting all this, just the best movie from this spider man the first spider man from Tom we can see very well that the spider had everything because of tony and now he is just like in the comics books a poor young man Who fights for his things, now he is going to work to have what he want it i love seeing the spider man growing up and developing, just my favorite movie now.", "Can't thank sony and Marvel enough for creating this masterpiece.": "Just came out of the theater and All I gotta say that thank god I was alive to see this movie, This is once in a lifetime experience can't be missed. Loved every single bit of the movie. This is something unimaginable they have created.", "A new classic": "A fantastic spidey-flick. It's jam packed with lots of laughs, and a lot of moments that bring tears to your eyes. With that said, the visuals are fantastic too. Make sure you sit through the credits!!", "BEST MOVIE EVER": "If you are a Spider-Man fan or just a super hero fan this movie is a must watch and probably my favourite movie of all time. Watch this movie at the theatres and getting chills when Toby and Andrew walk through the portals is just top tier. I'm just so happy I got to see it opening night :)", "The best Spiderman movie in our Universe": "I was in tears, the plot, the energy of all the actors and the script was outstanding. They have outdone themselves. I was in tears throughout the movie. Loved every minute.", "Childhood memories.": "This is one of my favourite marvel movies ever, and though the movie definitely has its problems, the feeling I had leaving the theatre was something I'll never forget.", "Marvel at its finest!": "What I truly loved about Spider-Man No Way Home is that it managed to perfectly encapture every emotion you could want to experience in a movie - there is humor, love, heartache, fear, anger - everything is perfectly blended together to give us a fully emotion-packed event that tugs you in every single direction. There was honestly not a single dull moment from the first scene up until the second post-credit scene!The visuals were mind bending, and the acting was absolutely phenomenol - with standouts 1000% being Tom Holland, Zendaya, and one other person who for me stood out thanks to the humor and heart that they brought to the movie!", "I went too hyped up for this movie and yet it delivered.": "I loved the movie the acting and the story. The movie was true to the previous franchise actors as well as the stories and created a connected universe. It had a few marvel jokes but it never missed the serious tone of the movie. Overall it's a movie worth watching at a Cinema. Nostalgia will hit you hard and there will be things that will change your perception about Tom Holland as Spider Man.", "Disappointed - very stupid plot": "I am a huge spiderman fan but it seems like each Tom Holland movie after Civil War and Homecoming were just garbage plots. Tom Holland makes stupid mistakes again causing the whole problem that he has to fix. It's a stupid premise and this one in No Way Home takes the cake.Was awesome to see Toby and Garfield back on screen. I did think the scenes with all the Spider-Man's together were gold. But overall, the absolutely idiotic plot to the movie ruins the homage to the old movies and makes this movie a complete dud.", "Entertaining and Nostalgic but ultimately overrated": "Overall I definitely enjoyed the film. Entertaining throughout and nostalgic with all the older characters back in action. The film was a bit slower than I would've liked and for me ultimately is currently massively overrated. A good, entertaining film, but no better than Tom Holland's other Spider-Man films so far.", "Impossibly average superhero movie": "One would thought the union of three Spider-Man's would make for something special, spectacular, or amazing. But the emotional stir from the union is about it...", "I believe there's a hero in all of us...": "This movie is the kind of movie that makes you want to be a hero; to be honest, to be noble, and to die with pride. It shatters the nihilistic indifference that plagues many heroic figures of our society and replaces it with selfless goodness. You need to see this film. This film will remind you who you are, and who you should be.", "with great power comes great responsibility": "There aren't words to describe SpiderMan No Way Home, you just have to scream and cry instead. Too many emotions. My throat hurts from all that screaming.", "The movie was amazing \ud83d\ude0d": "The movie was cool , I miss the old Spiderman's .and the old enemies especially doc oc . Sorry to what happens to ant may ,I will miss her \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d.can't wait for the next spiderman movie \u23f3", "Everything I wanted from it!!": "This is without a doubt, the best Spider-Man movie I have seen in a long time. It is just wonderful in its execution, balancing the emotional core of Spider-Man with the emormous scale of the MCU. I absolutely loved it. The small moments between MJ and Peter; Peter and Aunt May, the interactions between Spider-Man and the villians and the three Spider-Men was just pure ecstacy. I also absolutely love the open ended ending.Highly recommended. Must Watch for every fan of the MCU or Spider-Man.", "Best Marvel film yet!!": "Incredible from start to finish, I really never thought after all previous attempts we'd ever get to see the Spider-man film all Spider-man fans deserve, but it's finally here!! It was emotional, exciting, moments where you literally jumped out of your seat. The fight scenes were incredible and some great surprises. Just everything you'd want and need jam packed into one film.", "No spoiler review": "Best MCU film ever. Action sequences are to good to watch.

Trust me just go watch it if u wanna be chocked don't see spoilers.", "Quite Balance for SUPER DUPER HYPE Movie": "I have to admit that I'm a Spider-Man fan since the first movie came out (back there I'm just a really young kid) this movie has a really tough challenge for making the third episode of Spider-Man. This movie contain a lot of fan services for many of Spider-Man and Marvel studio fans. If you love their movies you won't regret watching this film I promise. They really can go beyond what they did in all of Marvel movie. But to talk about the movie facts, this movies itself is not that great (why you give 8! Cause I really love Spider-Man). The feeling from watching this movies is different, you can feel so much of what the fans will like but if you are not fan or just take your first time watching this movie you might be regret because the storyline, action scene, and script (except Willem Dafoe acting) in this movie is not exceed to what can you expect from a precious movie.", "Epic Movie a must watch for marvel lovers!!!!": "I managed to get tickets to watch the movie in the uk the day it came out and it was packed with action, sadness and plenty of shocking moments. Personally i still think andrew garfield is the best spider man, and the fact that he made an appearance was awesome i really loved that they also bring back all the old villains and of course the og tobey maguire, i don't see how they can make another spider man movie after this one because this acts as a good way to end the spider man movie collection. The ending deeply saddened me as well as the death of aunt may (RIP \ud83d\ude1e)The only thing i disliked about the movie is some characters made bad unrealistic decisions which made them look stupid but i guess these decisions must be made in order to have the action so it cancels out. The post credit scenes were interesting but i'm a bit annoyed that one of them was basically a trailer for a future movie which ruined the experience but the first scene was a bit odd at first, but when i understood that the symbiote was in tom hollands universe i was shocked as this could be the start of another movie. It is amazing how we get to see these actors grow up, it will be interesting to see if spider-man is still going on in 10yrs and how will the actors look like compared to their current state.", "It's just great!!!!!!": "In my opinion it's the best mcu film yet. I just love it. Andrew, Tobey ans Tom are just great spidermen. The villains alltogether are great too. And together they bring it to a whole new level.", "FANTASTIC": "I never leave reviews for anything but I had to create an account to review this film. I will definitely come back to see this again and it was definitely worth the wait. Absolute rollercoaster of emotions but any fan is sure to love every second!", "Jus simply wow!": "I'm 27. So grew up with the original Spider-Man films. To see Toby and Andrew together from two different universes combined with official cannon mcu. Was breath taking. Left theater wishing for me. No way home broke my expectations and then some. Very impressive film. The first 3 days of its release is when to see it to endure with the crowd. Leaving an unforgettable Experience. Spider-Man no way home. Please view it. Won't be disappointed.", "Believe the hype, it's absolutely amazing": "I loved this film, it's so emotional and perfect in every way. Brought back so many memories of being a kid. I wanted to watch ut again as soon as it ended.", "Heartwarming collection of favourites.": "Genuinely the most emotional rollercoaster a film has taken me through. From being a young girl watching Tobey Maguire to a teenager with Andrew Garfield and ages with Tom Holland. This film brought me so much joy. Best film, possibly ever. You can trust that the acting is top class when you see the line-up.", "Best Tom Holland Spider-Man Movie!": "I feel like the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies keep getting better and better. Homecoming was alright, Far From Home was awesome, and No Way Home was the best!", "My all time favourite movie": "I have no words, this movie is something else, just having every villain in it is amazing, and having tobey and Andrew just put the cherry on the cake, this makes endgame look rubbish, sorry but if this movies goes under 9 then people are crazy.", "Best Movie Ever": "I had very high expectations yet this movie still was higher than my expectations. Can't wait till everyone gets to see it. There will be multiple parts in the movie where your jaw will drop all the way down to the floor. And there will be part that will make you cry a whole river. In other words this movie is a emotion Rollercoaster.", "Are you in a band?!": "It's been a long time since I reviewed a movie - it appears to be because I was waiting for a movie like this. Stories are thriving when they make the audience question \"how\" how did they make a perfect movie (because it is). It's a perfect movie in its own genre. Even the comic reliefs were incredibly intellectually done. All I can say is, watch it, buy the god damn poster - and watch it again.", "Raising the Bar for the MCU": "Without a doubt, a new and exciting step for the MCU.This film combined a beautiful mix of nostalgia and excitement. Tom Holland has grown immensely in his performance of Peter Parker. The announcement of a new trilogy for him will undoubtedly be met with even more excitement.Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire gave brilliant performances and a beautiful conclusion to their own Peter Parker(s). Not much can be said about the feeling of seeing all three of the best superhero on screen.Willem Defoe once again delivered in his role of green goblin. No one can compare.", "Confusing": "In this movie there's so much going on. And so confusing at the same time. First what happened to those guys who investigated Peter Parker and why did it seem like not a big deal that his identity was revealed. They did what they did in Spider-Man 3 with Tobey Maguire. They brought back in way to many villains. For some reason Sony loves bringing in way to many villains in the 3rd movies.", "SPECTACULAR, WELL DESERVED AS THE MOST ANTICIPATED MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!": "I'd literally give 1 million stars if i could, this movies is amazing, and so much unexpected (no I'm not talking about the other two, I'm talking about the plot). The movie was sooo good, the reaction is everything, we all screamed, clapped, cried, laughed, you name it. It is so good, so exciting, yet so sad. It's amazing nonetheless.", "Silly but entertaining": "Despite the silly script it's entertaining to watch. It doesn't take itself too serious and that maybe makes this whole thing work. The effects look great, acting is good enough and it's pretty funny. Compared to the rest of those endless super hero movies, Spider-Man movies were always the most watchable - this one is no exception.", "Good enough for MCU fans, not enough for a good film": "To say it right off, I haven't seen the previous MCU Spider-Man movies and have stopped following the whole Marvel cosmos after Age of Ultron in 2015, so I have no comparison where this Spidy ranks amongst the other new one's.However, I have heard that this one was supposed to be the best one yet and watched it. During the first few minutes I cringed so hard because the whole plot seems like an ad for the MIT which later on got even more ridiculus, I mean as if a guy as smart as Peter Parker is required to go to the MIT to find a job (but ok you could say that for all Spider Man movies I guess). Also I don't personally like Tom Holland as Spider Man. Peter Parker is a nerd who slid into the role but still has a lot of struggles going on in his life. It doesn't feel right to see 2 of the most popular most followed upcoming instagram stars/actors in T. H. and Zendaya playing this story. The only reason Sony picked them is because they bring a large audience by nature, but they don't actually fit in the role how Stan Lee wrote it.1. Plot\nI did not feel any emotions when the aunty May dies, especially compared to when uncle Ben died in Spidy 1. All she did was giving Peter terrible advice and being annoying. It's almost a relief when she passed away (also the scene of her dieing made no sense. First she seemed totally fine, then suddenly she's dead)Tbh, I can see past this one, but it rly drives me crazy that no one talks about how Peter's friend simply picked up that ring from Dr. Strange, out of nowhere knows how to operate it and somehow in 90% of the cases seems to find just the right spell. This makes 0 sense and is just bad story telling. He should've somehow had to learn it in order to use it but that would be too much detail for the generic Marvel fan. Also, why tf did Dr. Strange act like that in the first place? I was told that he actually was an extremely rule driven and compliant guy, especially in Marvel's Endgame when he let Tony die. The motive to use this crazy dangerous spell seems atypical to from what I was told how he usually behaves.2. Fan Service / Marketing\nThere have been leaked messages from the Sony board member's team which showed conversations regarding how the upcoming movies will look like.It is no secret that MCU is a business, not art. But the way they talked about these movies is just disgusting.It was leaked that MCU films should follow a strict list of factors, such are: mention social media (tik tok, whatsapp, instagram), use memes, respect the social media generations' attention span by having action at least every 3 min, introduce the metaverse and melt all MCU's together etc.These factors were chosen only based on statistics and numbers on what makes the most money. I personally don't want them to reintroduce Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, Alfred Molino or Willem Dafoe just because the statistics said that would bring the biggest audience.Knowing that, it makes it so much less pleasant watching any of these movies where it's so obvious they plot doesn't have any meaning but to bring in viewers and keep the ball rolling. Sony has to produce at least one Spider-Man movie every 2 years or they loose the rights to Marvel. Quality over quantity has never been a good maxim. Especially not with film making.I am really suprised by how good the ratings are.That makes you wonder how bad the previous MCU films must've been to lower the critics' standards that much.I have to say though that the whole production looked, as expected from MCU, pretty flawless and also especially Molinas' and Dafoes' acting was on point. Nevertheless, good production quality and cool effects does not make up for poor storytelling caused by greed and ignorance.", "Enjoyed it but too many plot holes": "No doubt it was a great time at the movies. But there were some undeniable, glaring plot holes that had me scratching my head after the whole thing was said and done. I won't go into them here, as other reviewers have already rightly touched on them, and I want to keep my review spoiler free for those who haven't seen it and are simply thinking about seeing it. You will be entertained, but you kind of have to check your brain at the door. As far as this movie being on par with Endgame: sorry, not quite. And that's just the honest truth without the \"Spidey Fan Service\" (and I love Spider-man as a character). If you are a Spider-man fan, like me- definitely check it out. If you couldn't care less about Marvel movies or Spider-man, then I would go see another movie that would better suit your cinematic pallet.", "Masterwork.": "AAAAAAAAAAAAA!

People say you should keep your expectations low before watching a movie so you don't get too disappointed, I didn't do that and I still was not disappointed. I will gush about this film till the end of time! If you haven't seen it, go watch it, NOW!", "Rubbish! Absolute Rubbish!": "Anyone who says this movie is good has no idea what a great movie is!Slow, badly executed dialogue by a poorly-acted, clunky, cheesy cast and an overall bore.Only positive was a few good fight scenes but not enough to hold any significant value.It's really disappointing to think this is what people consider tasteful.", "Spoiler- Why couldn't Dr. Strange erase our memory too?": "Review full of spoilers.I wish Dr. Strange would have erased the memory of this Spiderman movie on the viewers too.I can't think of a more stupid plot than this one. Who is the bad guy of this movie? What is the huge adversity our heroes are facing this time?Plot: Spiderman having a tantrum asks Dr. Strange to put the universe at risk just to get a couple of kids into university. Dr. Strange on his mighty wisdom agrees to this. On top of that they f** up the spell because Peter can't keep bothering and asking for changes to the wizard as if it was a 5 years old asking presents to Santa.Great, but it gets even more stupid. They caught all the multiversal bad guys and Spiderman acting like the new Jesus tries to be more ethical than all the previous Spiderman and wants to save the villains from previous movies, he doesn't know why or how they died, they could be massive child murderers it doesn't matter because he is on a moral mission to make everything rainbow happiness. Not matter the risk or consequences (like auntie dying, hundreds of innocents dying or the whole city being destroyed with all these new villains running free).Great idea mixing all the Spiderman movies with the multiverse and getting the original actors to do it. But a stupid weak plot just takes you out of the movie, makes you lose emphathy.By the way, latest spiderman f** up everything trying to be so morally good that is ridiculous but at the end is about to murder a poor old man out of rage. ..", "No more spider man and the word home for me": "Hated it!

Masterstroke by Sony and Marvel. The fans are pleased.", "You know what's better than magic? Math!!": "Honestly i was a bit disappointed at the beginning of the movie cuz they let me fell like i was a kid, the scripts were a bit childish ngl, even when may died there was no blood or a big wound, even after the movie ended i didn't know how she died.I know it's pg13 but come on, at least give me an explanation.When spider man tobey maguire was injured at the end, we couldn't see any wound, i was expecting more. The movie would've been perfect if it was R18 or something like that.The end of the movie was great actually they build great foundation for next spider-man movies.Specially when Mj was going to fall from the building that gave me goosebumps.It's a good movie, u should watch it.", "An Amazing Spider-Man Movie": "This Spider-Man movie in my opinion is the best spidey movie & depiction on the wall crawler on the big screen, it has good humour throughout & does get emotional at times. Bringing back classic Villains does at times make you feel nostalgic, the amount of villains at times does get slightly too much however but it's an amazing cinematic experience you need to watch on the big screen.Highly recommend.", "Believe the hype!!": "I had the most anticipated pleasure of watching Spider-Man: No Way Home last night with my 9 year old daughter last night.The frenzied rumour mill gained momentum over the months after the announcement of the next installment of Tom Holland's take on probably the popular Marvel character in the studios arsenal.My daughter loves this version of Spider-Man since homecoming. I have to agree\nHaving watched the Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield versions, Tom just adds that fun comic Saturday morning cartoon feel to the whole franchise.I still love the earlier installments but this trilogy is just awesome! Rounded off with a character packed assemble that ticks all the emotional boxes.My daughters rollercoaster of expression of delight was worth every penny.Thank you Tom Ward and Marvel for making a 44 year old feel as young and happy as my 9year old.", "Honoring the history of spiderman \u2764\u2764\u2764": "It's a fun ride through the movie full of great nostalgia filled with heart and intense moments it felt like endgame \u00d75. Its a most to watch it again to even enjoy it more.", "With great power comes great responsibility ... and they did it!!!": "The first thing that needs to be said is: I have no nostalgia towards any of the spidermen or any of the movies.This film is like you take the most emotional moments from all movies you've ever seen and you cut it to two and a half hours of a film. I wasn't sure if I should cry of sadness, madness, happiness, laughter, or romance. One line is a joke, the next line is the saddest thing ever. It just shows how good writers, actors, producers and director are behind this. All of the actors are so great, their performances are so unreal.The action in this movie is the best action I've ever seen in a superhero movie. After the disappointment with the last few Marvel movies, this bought me back. The fight scene between Strange and Peter or between Peter 1 and Green Goblin at the end are examples of how the fight scenes should look. Jon Watts's style of directing in this movie is so unique and so great, it just blew my mind. Maybe this is the reason, why the movie doesn't have problems with action scenes as other Marvel movies.This brings me to the CGI part of the film. CGI is for me one of the most important things. If the movie of this scale and genre doesn't have a good CGI, I just can't rate it higher than 8. It's like having a pretty good dinner but you don't add any salt to any food you have. So I'm so glad that CGI in this film is awesome, because, as I always say, the good CGI is when you know they're using CGI, but you don't see they're using CGI. Really great job, especially, as I mentioned earlier, in the last few Marvel movies, the CGI was in some moments that bad, I just can't unsee it and just enjoy the scene.The only thing I perhaps partially don't like about this movie is the ending. I was like you can't do this dark of an ending. I was so mad the few last minutes of the movie. But I get it, in the deeper meaning it makes sense, but it's still so nerve-wracking, especially when you find out in the post-credit scene, that it basically doesn't solve the problem, if anything, it made it a little bit smaller problem? I don't know, I just wish Peter would be in this moment selfish for once, but I know it would be out of character.Overall, the movie is so great that I cannot give it less than a 10. Like every mistake anyone has ever had with Marvel movies and previous Spiderman movies, it's fixed in this movie. It's a movie that you just will remember, you will remember the day you saw it in the movies, you'll remember what you felt during the film. It will have an impact on you and on the history of cinema.", "The Best Experience !": "The thing is I wasn't disappointed when I finished the movie but I think that the thing that made it better is Andrew and Tobey's appearance in the movie but overall I enjoyed it so much!", "The 3rd best marvel movie for me.": "For a fan, I mean the whole movie is a theme park. I'm only here to bump up the rating even higher really. Tobey Maguire's every word a joke. Andrew Garfield is cute. Willem Dafoe's I'm something of a scientist myself line is the best.", "Best Spider-man movie of all time!": "This is hands down the best Spider-man movie of all time. I enjoyed the original trilogy and its iconicness, but No Way Home was definitely something else. In terms of the MCU I think this one is up there with Infinity War and End Game, no doubt! This is not a recommendation to watch it, it's an order, a must! The fighting scenes were extraordinary, one of the best I've seen. Especially the one with Dr. Strange.From start to finish you find yourself entangled in the storyline and you will experience some major ups and downs (I think I shed a tear just as much as I laughed). The nostalgia definitely hits different in this movie. Basically it was an emotional roller coaster and I never seemed to be able to get my eyes of the screen. There was always something happening!(SPOILERS INCOMING)The best part was definitely the entry of the other two other Spider-men. 1,5 hour of the movie had already passed and then and there I felt convinced they weren't going to be there. Literally the minute after, Ned opened up the first portal, the entire theatre turned into a sports arena and we were all cheering and screaming when Andrew popped through. Even more so when Tobey arrived. Just wow, chills.This is one of those movie I wish I could experience for the first time again, it was just that amazing!!", "Don't love it": "I just don't understand how people love this Spider-Man so much. Toms Holland's character kinda sucks tbh, he causes all of these movies to take place, like he has no common sense and it pisses me off. Cmon like you start talking stranges ear off while he's doing a spell for you?? They try and make the movie feel heartbreaking for the viewer, in reality Idgaf because he caused every second of the movie. I gave this movie my last shot on liking Holland's Spider-Man, it disappointed. Still had good moments and was entertaining, I just don't like these common plot points that make the movie seem forced.", "Best Spider-Man Movie !!!": "Spider-Man No Way Home is by far the best Spider-Man movie yet. Performance of Tom Holland in the movie is very good and commendable. It is a treat for every Spider-Man fan. It in a very great continues as well as concludes the Spider-Man's journey in the homecoming trilogy.", "Yesss": "I loved seeing all three spider men together,I definitely recommend for all of my marvel lovers out there.i loved seeing Tobey Maguire\nagain in action I grew up with him as my spider man, and ofc I loved seeing Andrew Garfield as well.", "A Bit Lazy!": "I personally think it's a bit lazy, that they got the same actors from the old Spider Man, and they just didn't create a new plot and used the old one. I think personally they could do better!", "Wooooowww!!": "Words cannot express how much I love led this movie!!!! It was so well done!!! Tom Hollands acting was so amazing in this movie!!! It is definitely the best I've seen him he is just so phenomenal!! And Willem Dafoe!!! Wowww! I just don't even know what to say he was just so amazing!!

Damn the experience was so good. And Tom Holland is truly a gem the way he acted at last it was just mind blowing. Hats off. He said so many things without saying anything.", "Best Spider-Man Movie Ever Made!!!": "Spider-Man No Way Home is everything you need from an ending of a great trilogy of a great franchise that started the modern superhero genre. As a die-hard comic book fan of spider-man since I first saw Tobery Mcguire's Spider-Man movie in 2002, I always leaned towards the great storytelling of Peter Parker's life. And This movie delivers every good, bad, and ugly side of spider-man in the most theatrical experience ever! I would highly recommend watching all the previous spider-man films before watching this. This movie was a redemption for curse of all the previous spider-man movies that didn't land a perfect ending from Tobey Mcguire Spider-Man 3 to Andrew Garfield's never made third film. Also, the only superhero movie that made me cry and feel every bit of emotion after the ending.", "Sad to see marvel fall so far": "This movie supposedly broke rotten tomato records which is practically impossible because this movie was terrible. More than half the people leaving the theater should be disappointed. For any comic book fans out there, I'm sorry. The idea behind the multiverse is comic book gold but the way they did it was so lame. I'd be embarrassed to be the director or the writers. Into the spiderverse is everything we want out of a comic hero movie and No way home is just the biggest cash grab yet.", "Hot Damn": "Hot damn this movie was good. I wanted to write a review after I'd seen it twice so I could solidify my thoughts, and now that I have, I find my thoughts on the movie extremely solidified.The first 30 minutes or so was a lot of set up, which is what the first act of a movie is supposed to be, and during this film it could seem a little boring... but during my second watch through, I absolutely loved the set up. We get some Easter eggs, which is super cool, but it also set up the rest of the story really well.I'm currently in film school, taking screenwriting classes, and while some may disagree, I actually found the dialogue between Peter and the villains to be well placed and well written-not too on the nose-and very informative. There were also several touching and raw emotional moments, which was brought by the fantastic acting.I loved the cinematography in this as well. The lighting in practically all of the shots were magnificent, especially during the climax and a bit of the resolution. These scenes had such beautiful shots.This film had everything: fantastic story with a lot of character growth, amazing cinematography, nostalgia while still giving the audience something new and something to be excited for, and some superb acting that brought great humor and beautiful touching moments.This was by far my favorite *live-action* Spider-Man film and, in my opinion, one of the best well-made Spider-Man movies.", "Best Spider Man Movie Ever": "It was amazing when the three Spider Man's came together, I loved the plot very well. It was heart broking when Andrew Garfield's spiderman saved Mj. As a Spider Man fan, This is best Spider Man movie \"#SpiderManNoWayHome\". The acting of Tom Holland and Tobey was amazing too.

The 4th phase is going to be epic.", "THE BEST SPIDER-MAN FILM.": "(THE BEST SPIDER-MAN MOVIE!). I don't have many words to describe this movie other than epic. We see a Peter suffering absolutely the entire movie, after all everyone knows his identity. Mj and Ned are great in the movie, Dr Strange is also very good. Peter's kindness is no comment, that's being SPIDERMAN. The villains are great, especially the Green Goblin, who kills Aunt May (WITH GREAT POWERS, COMES A GREAT RESPONSIBILITIES). Happy appears at suitable times. And what about the Fan Service, Andrew Garfield is the funniest shot, a great spider. Tobey is the most experienced and everyone respects him the most.

Alot of excitement for the mcu fans out there. Make sure to watch \"venom let there be carnage\" ending scene and \"spider man homecoming\", \"spider man far from home\" before seeing this movie!

This is certainly not the case.The acting is ok to good, for the most part (with the exception of W. Dafoe, which is great). CGI is of the same quality, as in the previous movies, though it seemed to me that their use was not so extended as in FFH.The main reason that the movie suffers, is the plot and the writing in general: After the events of FFH, which made Spiderman's identity public, Peter Parker and his friends' lives are changed to the worse. After their applications to Universities get rejected,due to the publicity of the matter, Peter asks for the help of Dr Strange, who proposes to cast a spell brainwashing the whole world to forget (as it turns out later, Peter could just ask for a re-evaluation of the applications). Wong, who has become the Sorceror Supreme, will allow it to happen, despite the fact that he is well aware of the dangers! As a result of a childish behavior from P. Parker during the spell and a chain of false decisions, 5 of the most dangerous villains in Spiderman comics are released to the world (one of them should not even be there, as he didn't know Spiderman's true identity).The real action is taking place in the last 2/3s of the movie, when the 3 spidermen do not refer to the plot and the differences of their respective movies (which they do a lot). The closure though feels better than the rest of the movie - in a sad way.Though this is not a 'bad' movie, the hype which has been built is not in par with what it delivers. Maybe I should wait for a disappointment, for not being disappointed afterwards...", "Amazing like Spider-Man himself": "As expected.

My problem with this movie lies within Peter Parkers (Tom Holland's) decision making. I do not blame Tom Holland and would go as far to say he did a good job in this movie.However the plot seemed ridiculous to me and here is why!Spider-Man's identity is known by everyone and it's thought by everyone that he is a villain other than by his friends and family. Yes this may be a problem for Spider-Man but what's a bigger problem for spider man? Him and his friends aren't accepted into college. Instead of ringing the college up and trying to convince the college otherwise, as made a joke by the film, what is the logical thing to do? Ask dr strange to cast a spell which can mess with universes and could potentially destroy your whole world.What makes it even more ridiculous (I know it's a movie) is that dr strange and Spider-Man didn't even talk about and plan exactly what they want the spell to do before casting this potentially world destroying spell letting in villains from other universes and who knows what else could have been let in. Instead during the spell Peter Parker adds tweaks to the unpredictable spell whilst dr strange is casting it causing all of this and dr strange accepts these tweaks. I do not fully blame Spider-Man for this because he is a young 17 year old kid and therefore will make stupid decisions. However a wise wizard excepting to chop and change his spell whilst casting it potentially putting the world at risk, may I remind you so that Peter Parker can give his friends a second chance at getting into college seems utterly ridiculous.With all this being said these two heroes, dr strange and Spider-Man have recently gone through saving half the population from thanos but now want to risk tampering with time and the whole world because of a college application decline. Particularly nearing the end of the movie I couldn't help but to laugh to think the whole world is collapsing and going to be destroyed because of this silly reason.Whilst this does seem like an overall negative review I did love all the actors coming into one film even though at times it did feel a bit cramped. Particularly the green goblin portrayed a creepy and evil character you look for in a villain. He is character who is unpredictable and gives off a truly dangerous vibe.I would have accepted and enjoyed the movie to have much better and logical reasoning behind the need to cast the spell in the first place.", "THE BEST SPIDER MAN MOVIE EVER.....!!": "This movie is the freakn best spiderman film so for . Omg the theatre experience was on an entirely different level. It completely exceeded my expectations. MUST WATCH GUYS DONT MISS THIS.......!!", "Epic and Emotional": "This is literally one of the best comic book movie of all time and the best Spiderman movie\nThis movie has everything that you want from a Spiderman Movie and it's just Epic.", "One of the most epic movie in cinema history": "I went to the movie without getting any spoilers, I just watched the trailers, I saw a few theories, and I watched the actors's interviews. Before watching, I went with normal expectations, I knew it would be a good movie, but there were a few things that I couldn't make sure of were bothering me. I'm not a movie expert, I know so little about movies so you may disagree with what I wrote, these are my feelings within first hour. So about the movie, in my opinion, this movie is one of the best Marvel movies ever made. One. Of. The. Best. Marvel. Movies. I literally don't think there is a single word to describe my feelings rn. The last time I've watched End-Game, my feelings were this intense, but End Game is not even close what I felt in this movie. The story is basically based on Spider-Man's character which I found very clever, I mean the way how the story's reflecting his personality. I really don't quite know how to phrase my feelings and thoughts right now, while watching the movie, you're looking at a scene where you can feel every emotion, especially at a certain point in the movie, pain, happiness, surprise, confusion. The first half was a bit slower than the second half, but not in a bad way because it's a preparation phase, but the second half completely closes the stagnation in the first half because it ends when you don't realize what is going on because of action. There are typical Marvel jokes from time to time, I can't say I laughed at some of them, but it doesn't matter because I don't know if it's because I'm a Marvel fan in general or because I'm really feeling so hyped right now, but it really was one of the best, most surreal and most phenomenal movies I've ever seen. No matter with what expectations you go to the cinema, but definitely go. It was an incredible experience for me and it seems impossible to express my feelings without giving spoilers at this point :D As for after-credits, the first after credit was not a big deal, but the second after credit is really important, actually it was the only spoiler I've got, I guess but even though I got spoilers about this one, I remember holding tight to the theater seats. It was really awesome, it was a movie I wish I could forget and watch again, and I think it will be on my mind for a very, very long time. A feast for my eyes.", "Best movie in the MCU": "This movie feels like a circle momento all over. Made me wanna scream in every single second. The only thing missing in it were the Avengers.I think i will never get over this one.", "Best Spider-Man ever made": "From a fan since the Toby Maguire Spider-Man's, this is hands down the best Spider-Man ever made.Bringing together decades worth of Spider-Man's in a web so masterfully spun, you can't beat it!Marvel got it right!The end and the beginning all in one movie.If you like super hero movies you've got to go see it!", "Great Movie... Must see!!!": "Well done Marvel. We done.... A great stand alone movie and MCU integrated movie. Tons of Easter Eggs. 9.5 out of 10. Looking forward to more Dr. Strange and Wanda in the future.", "Only Reason i watched is because of Toby Maguire": "#makespiderman4But to be honest now. The first 40 minutes are horrible. Everything else is watchable.There is no way this movie is placed #19 in best movies of all time smh.", "Hear me out": "I understand why people rate this a ten... I myself grew up with these three iterations of Spider-Man and consider myself a fan, and there is a LOT of fan service to enjoy here! I would have never imagined these worlds colliding but after finally seeing it happen I feel \"almost\" completely empty and I'll attempt to explain why. Still I'll admit that I liked some of the emotional nostalgia from Garfield and Toby and my problem isn't with them, but I think I have two main problems.I could pick a part a lot of little problems I have like, if the people that \"know Spider-Man\" were sent to this universe, where were the other uncle bens and aunt Mays and Toby's Mj, why just these specific characters? Or the fact that doctor strange didn't want to erase Peter from everyone's memories at the end but was cool with it at the begging, but these can be overlooked compared to my two main problems. My first problem and smaller of the two is that I feel spiderverse not only handled the complexity of a multiversal movie better but it did it first. I thought the villains in that movie had better motives and the character growth of miles was more natural and his interaction with the other \"Spider-Man\" characters was more realistic and less corny and on the nose and I thought the reason for the multiverse was more integral to the plot rather than just \"Fix my problem wizard\" which is fine but not as good. But I could debate all day about why I felt it was handled better, the most important reason I compare these two films is BECAUSE spiderverse came out first. Although the plot of this movie is completely different from spiderverse the concept and plot hook of this movie is the same. I can honestly say that everything about this movie that I liked I walked into the theater expecting to happen. I expected all of these villains to show up, I expected Toby McGuire and Andrew to show up, I expected the fan service, I expected Peter and strange to end up fixing his identity reveal and return everyone to their rightful place somehow, and I expected these things because I saw spiderverse do it already (minus the identity reveal) so I knew it was possible, which is why I was also expecting this movie to bring something new to the table I didn't expect. Something that could set it apart from spiderverse in a thrilling way, and a big part of my feelings towards this movie was hinging on that expectation, and this leads into my second and biggest problem with this movie.What I didn't expect this movie to do, was put all of the conflicts and conclusions of the other Spider-Man universes and stories I hold near and dear on the shoulders of Tom Holland's Spider-Man. By making the conflict of this story about literally fixing these villains whose conflicts and stories were already concluded and fleshed out, the movie is expecting me to think Tom Holland's Spider-Man has a better solution. I enjoy his Spider-Man, I think that attempting to fill Tony stark's shoes is a noble task, understanding responsibility is important even if it means watching your aunt die because of your decisions and losing your identity and everyone you know and love to save the world is heroic! But this isn't new to superhero archetypes and it isn't new to Spider-Man so I don't see how Tom Holland's Character led him to this and Toby and Andrew's characters couldn't have. (And yes I know they were there to help but it was for the growth of Tom's character not theirs.) They were obviously willing to sacrifice just as much in there respective stories so what makes tom's character and personality special to the point that he deserves to rewrite their stories? The answer is because the directors say so I guess, I just think that's a lot of responsibility to put on this character, a character I still feel like I don't know other than the fact that he's, as mj put it \"a good guy\". I don't feel the same character depth I felt with Toby, or tchala, or fat Thor, or especially miles, the character whose movie's main conflict and concept this movie is using.I like this movie more than I dislike it, and the parts I enjoy I love! But I can't say I didn't see them coming, and I've seen them done before and better. This film's greatest attributes are through its connection to its fan base, and as a fan of not only the Spider-Man characters, but their storylines and conflicts, I'm torn on this movie, enough to give it a 6/10. I hope this doesn't change your 10/10 if that's how you feel but if you felt similarly but couldn't put your finger on why, maybe this related to you. But to those 10/10's I hope you keep enjoying this. Maybe I just need to give it time.", "Spider man nwh": "Spider man no way home it's from the top 3 movie I had ever watched it's comedy dramatic action it talks about the multiverse and how dr strange made his magic and make the dead people alive like electrico and doctor octopus and green goblin ... and how spider man try's protect them from death and saved them and try to treatment the villans it's the best movie in the mcu.", "YOU WILL NOT REGRET EVERY SINGLE SECOND YOU SPENT WATCHING THIS MOVIE!!": "THEY KILLED IT!!KEVIN FEIGE, JON WATTS, AND ALL THE MEMBER AND ACTORS DID IT!!At first i have a doubt bcs how suddenly they come up with the multiverse story and how big is the expectation are, but mann marvel studio killed it without feeling like too push over with the whole plot, everything seem so smooth and wonderful!The nostalgic, fan service is 100!

Marvel has returned the childhood of fans who have grown watching tobey and Andrew there entry was best and certain things showed in movie such as the supremacy of tobey , Aunt may dialogue , andrew saving MJ and the villans specially who played a great role in movie specially goblin character. It was the best spiderman movie and introducing daredevil in this way was amazing. But i wanted the theme song of tobey and Andrew also to feel the goosebumps but its okay. The fight between Dr strange and peter was also great. The ending was best it shows how the real spiderman is living in rented house alone, making his own costume and no one knows his identity. The teaser for next spiderman movie was also amazing having venom. The dr strange trailer was a emotion for those fans who have watched what if series and know about supreme strange.

Bringing back the classic villains and both Spider-Men was the most phenomenal idea ever, and their presence makes your heart content.However, although the movie was 2hr28m, I think the plot was a bit rushed. It might have been better to introduce Tobey and Andrew earlier, so they could get more screen time and have the chance to bond more - maybe have some drinks at a bar before they return to their earth after fighting the villains? We could've learnt more about what they've been up to during these 10 and 20 years. This would've made their characters more dynamic and given them more of a background, instead of fighting the bad guys and calling it a day. For example, does Tobey end up having children with MJ? Instead of him saying \"It's complicated\", they could've at least brought MJ back for us to see a snippet of their life together.*** Another thing I wish had happened was for them to really make use of the multiverse. Remember when Andrew used to follow Gwen around and watch her from tall buildings? After arriving from his universe to help Tom, Andrew could do his normal thing and look down from a building, where he spots a blonde girl. And when she looks up, it could've been Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) from Tom's earth, which could've been another shot at happiness for him. Or, they could've done a time jump, and a few years later, after Tom starts attending MIT, Andrew and Tobey visit him in his world for a drink or for a meal, and Tom could've brought a friend along and said \"Hey guys, I'd like to introduce you to a classmate of mine at MIT. This is Gwen Stacy.\" And this could also have been another shot for Andrew. He definitely deserves more of a happier ending. I don't know, it's just a thought... But overall, a huge thank you on behalf of the whole Spidey fanbase!", "Horribe": "I'm apaently the only one that thought this movie was horrible. All the attempts to be funny fell short by a long shot. The Toby McGuire version was actually better.", "It's very good however": "It's very good I was loving every minute of it seeing all the villains appearing from the first Spider-Man with Tobey Maguire and then seeing villains from The Amazing Spider-Man with Andrew Garfield, and the affects they do to Tom Holland Spider-Man couldn't complain the fights and action amazing and great cameo not say who, the relationship and friendship with Tom Holland Peter Parker with MJ and Ned it's brilliant one of the best in the MCU. This film is brilliantly set up for Dr Strange and the multi-verse of madnessHowever for me this seem to be the end of Spider-Man in the MCU with dr strange's final spell for everyone to forget Peter Parker. All the relationships and friendships built up over the years of the MCU have now gone.It feels to me Sony wants Spider-Man back away from the MCU to make a film with Venom and others that Sony have the rights too I might be a bit cynical but that's how it feels to me, I'm hoping I'm wrong very wrong.Only thing that let the film down but I say it's a good film well worth a watch.", "By Far the Best Spider-Man movie Made!": "As for being a Spider-Man film, this film was a wonderful conclusion to the MCU's Spider-Man. It had everything; emotional connections/tear jerking moments. And of course the villains in which in their own retrospect pushed spider man to his fullest teaching him that being a superhero doesn't mean it's going to be easy - their are going to be moments of ultimate regret and denial that you don't see in most superhero movies\n(I at least haven't seen villains outright attack the hero both emotionally and physically!)\nBut the villain that deserves the most credit is by far William DeFoes 'Green Goblin' (comic book wise he was picture perfect ((watching him through the runtime of the movie feels like he never died in the Magiuer Trilogy)))\nOverall this movie was a stunning portrayal of what is counted as a concluding movie Nolan did a wonderful job doing that with the Dark Night Rises but what Nolan does for Batman John Whatts does for Tom Hollands Spider-Man.I just hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did for it definitely deserves the rating users and I have given it.

Nice action footages, decent to great acting from most characters, and pretty huge nostalgic dose in a 160 min ride with Parker and his gang. For the first half of the movie it was pretty shocking the way they were heading in for this movie. The motives for the characters is really unexpected and interesting. Sadly, as the second half begin, the writers really got lazy to find a way of solving the conundrum they put together. So they decided that it all can be, by magic, forgotten. LIKE THE MOVIE NEVER HAPPENED. It reminds me of x-men franchise when for every movie you watch, you have to scrape some old movies from your memory as if they never happened. It takes guts to do such thing, but it also raises too many questions about the storyline and doesn't help anyone ( at least me, a moviegoer) to fill the plot holes on his own, without waiting for producers and directors to tell us what really specific scenes and acts meant in the movie, which is annoying.Another con about the movie and any other marvel movie actually is how puplicity affect the experience. Trailers lies, theories flow all over the Internet, too many critics doesn't point out why you should watch the movie because it either is a spoiler or it will spoil something in the future films. People are not stupid, if I hear rumours for a year about some character in the movie, even if producers denied it, I still won't be surprised that much about it. And if all what this character going to do is just show up then leave without any affect in future plots, then why bother?Plot points that annoyed me: (spoilers ahead)* Tom Holland's Pete is a boxing bag, he got beaten in nearly every fight he had, the guy is an avenger and fought in major universal battles and still get batista bombed throughout the ceiling by a 66 years old man\n* Dr. Strange is really weak, in his decisions and in his battles, which is not what we used to see in earlier films\n* every villain brought just before they die, you would assume that the spidermen would be brought also before they were about to die, right?* don't really get what was the other 2 Petes were doing the whole time, why weren't they are swinging around and asking people what the hell is happening\n* there are a lot of jokes in the movie that are just awkward silence, which not really funny if everybody stare at each other awkwardly every 2 minutes.* with great power comes great responsibility *5 times*\n* movie plot is really about Peter and his friends wanting to get accepted in a university with acceptance rate of 7% and using magic to so after they were rejected\n*Matt Murdock showing up was an excellent option to make the plot about Peter having to get into trail, reminded me of Iron man court hearing. Sadly they threw that away\n* most of the cures where shots of some sort, couldn't they just somehow shoot them? Without having to be near them\n* they are all friends after losing there power\n* ned knew how to do magic like Dr. Strange, who spent months learning in some Asian country, by accidentI really wanted to like this movie, It was disappointing. I get that is a fan service and it is a guaranteed fan's favorite for some years to come, but it wasn't what I expected.", "Great!!": "Dont listen to the DC Fanboys, its a great movie with lots of fun and depht, its Maybe not perfekt, but its not trash Like Zack Snyder's Justice League or Wonder Woman \ud83d\ude09", "Definitely overrated": "A good movie, but nothing outstanding. There were certain points where the ovie was really dragged out, and the plot was predictable. Though the conclusion was pretty great, the overall movie experience wasn't deserving of the rating of a 9 (at the time of writing it, this movie has an imdb of 9). The comedy was pretty good and well executed, however. Gotta hand it to them for executing some pretty good jokes here and there overall, a decent movie but not absolutely mind blowing in any way.", "Was this an attack": "Worst Best movie ever.... Just pain and pain no entertainment Just pain...No happiness and then pain again and again .. Made me laugh once or twice but then pain again...I continue writing this because of the150 words minimum requirement but only one thing is true This was the world's best movie but gave no pleasure just pain pain and pain again. Thank you.", "Fan service done right": "This is how a Spider-Man film should be. Classic villains, great fight scenes, emotional character moments and questioning the moral compass of the characters.A film like this with so many characters has been seen done and failed several times in a Spider-Man film. Spider-Man 3 and the amazing Spider-Man 2. But where these failed this film managed to achieve. Bringing back 5 classic Spider-Man villains from both the franchises which 2 cameos (Eddie brock and Matt murdock) and the already established MCU characters this film should've felt bloated but it flowed so well. These characters for put in for fan service but it was executed perfectly. Tom Holland was on point as Spider-Man in this film as you see him battle between his moral compass of trying to help everyone and still have these 2 separate lives. While there's a collection of villains. Green Goblin is the stand out reminding us all of why he is the OG villain that we all loved growing up in 2002.The inclusion of each universes Spider-Man again should've felt rushed and shoehorned in but they pulled it off. Seeing Andrew and Toby revisit their roles had the whole cinema cheering. Hopefully this is the start of their franchises reigniting.Overall the ending was a sweet conclusion to the 'Home' trilogy but sets up nicely for a new Spider-Man series more traditional without the help of stark suits.

Rarely have I been in a movie theatre where the crowd oohs in excitement of what is to come and clap when they see their fan anticipation satisfied. Spiderman No Way Home delivers.If there was a criticism, it is the reliance on established tropes from previous Marvel releases to ensure an emotional resonance with the audience, it feels a little manipulative to be offered a similar gut punch in order to prove its heart. And this is another aspect of SNWH (Spider-Man No Way Home) that reminds one of Endgame.Yet the movie moves along at an epic pace, with plenty of humour and \"spoilers\" to ensure the movie is like a delicious degustation, allowing its audience to enjoy every different dish and mouthful.It is hard to think of how the filmmakers could have improved upon the film in all but minor ways, as the overall effort is pleasing, fun and entertaining.And the movie crosses so many barriers found in previous efforts, allowing the multiverse to be utilised so that old character can return, even the original villain The Green Goblin (as shown in the trailers), to return to great effect. It is a credit to the actors and filmmakers that they can bring back characters from so long ago and yet breathe new life into them. There are also some nods to the Spider-Man and Marvel folklore and comics which provide some entertaining in-jokes to the audience.And you are best to see it as soon as possible before all the spoilers are leaked and the movie is just a matter of filling in the mundane blanks.It also encourages repeat viewings as there is so much to take in, particularly in the major battles when there is so much going on and with so many characters.And it also shows off some of the key characters to good effect, with Tom Holland cementing his place at the webbed hero. In some respects, Mysterio was more of the key character in the last spider film (far from home) but in this, the villains never displace Tom Holland's Spider-Man from his throne, even though at times the villian's brilliance shine.It's the kind of film that just begs repeat viewing and also entertain the widest possible audience - from the fans of the Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man to the young fans of the recent Marvel efforts.A minor observation was some poor CGI on the briefest of occasions and some lines or actor expressions that are a bit silly or don't come off. But overall the balance is maintained which is not easy in such a big movie.Enjoy it while you can, it is hard to see how Spider-Man can exceed this current effort.", "I don't think they did anything wrong or could've done anything more": "The kid in me was so stoked to see this and it did not disappoint.I was a kid when all three of the originals came out and was in high school for the amazing Spider-Man movies and I didn't really care for them but didn't hate them either.

In my opinion Andrew stole the show in this without a doubt, but of course Tobey's performance was perfect and his acting was superb. All villain actors were amazing too.

One day, he decides to ask Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) for help, but then butchers the spell Strange prepared to make everyone forget that Parker is Spider-Man. And thus, invaders from the multiverse come to the MCU's earth to conquer it.This movie may play a lot with fanservice and nostalgia, but does it in a good way. When both other Peters (Tobey and Andrew) appear on screen, it just feels satisfying. The same could be said for the death of Aunt May. This death is clearly a reference to Ben Parker's death, and somehow it manages to feel completedly different at the same time.Overall, this movie experiements a lot, especially with the villains. In the closest adaption of the Sinister Six we got yet, there are some characters that are just as good as before or even better (for example Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin). Sadly, not every villain is as interesting as Mister Osborn in this movie.Seeing the three Spider-Men swing together in one screen is a experience every fan of the superhero genre should try out.

What a waste of time, i cannot remember when was the last time that i left a movie theater in the middlof the show.", "Entertaining, but maybe a little too scattered and overhyped": "I have some mixed feelings about this movie. On one hand, the movie does a great job at keeping the viewer entertained, but on the other it is really really scattered and doesn't seem like a coherent story at all unless you have seen literally every single other spiderman movies that both sony and marvel have made.This movie is a comic book brought to life in cinematography and plot, but perhaps this film should be used as an example of why pure comic format should stay in only comics. The film relies too heavily on the shock value of bringing in new characters, and uses it to replace a compelling story line and dialogue. This movie truly has no home, because it seems like the creators changed the story 5 times and just mashed together footage until they had enough cameos to make fans think it was good.", "Best freakin Marvel movie ever!!!": "Best freakin Marvel movie ever!!! Spidey gets his own Endgame. It has everything. Needs to be seen on the big-screen and not just once but probably 2-3 times, its that good. Absolutely mindblowing!", "AN EXCITING MOVIE": "This movie was amazing. The movie took me back in time for 1 hour and got me nostalgic. For the first time, I liked a tom holland spider-man series so much. The plot was handled perfectly, the dialogues were realistic and the emotion felt good. Another thing that makes me very happy in the movie is that all the bad guys are back in the old cast. I broke 1 point because of 31 iq marvel jokes. Every minute of the movie was exciting. It was great to see it again in the movie.", "There's no way they did that": "I've never left an iMDB review but I felt that I had to for this one. Although I've enjoyed many of the MCU movies, I've also always been critical of them and the franchise as whole. But I must say that this movie surpassed every expectation I had by a mile. The creators took a tremendous risk with NWH, and they absolutely should not have succeeded with it. But they did, and they did it masterfully. The MCU's ability to mix science fiction, fantasy, and comedy with realism, drama, and emotion is exemplified better than in any of the previous films in the franchise. I had newfound respect for the minds behind the MCU after seeing Endgame, but with this I can't consider them anything short of masterclass filmmakers.", "Bad acting and too much cgi": "Just wasted 2.5 hours and 47 Euro on this vehicle. Some attempts for humour were made - I told better jokes when I was 12. The acting.... Wooden and too many attempts to make us emotional- it didn't work.

Especially with plot twists and deaths that made the movie even better, the surprise of all 3 spider mans in this movie made it EXCELLENT. Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Toby Maiguire's acting was the best!! The saddest part of the movie was when Aunt May died which was a huge shock to everyone! The villains were amazing as Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, Electro, Lizard and Sandman came back!!! This was a great movie, including when Venom came into it in the end creidts!!!", "A Theme Park Ride, for Better or Worse": "It's a theme park ride, for better or worse. Characters from older franchises suffer poor character development in exchange for fan service. A decent flick with superficial feels. Also, the cyclical nature of these films begin to wear thin.", "Review of the film - \"Spider-Man, there is no way back\"": "One of the most epic, large-scale and daring films. Holland showed almost the best game since the beginning of his career, his partners in the film received unexpectedly a lot of screen time. And the general idea and ending of the film finally bring the story of Spider-Man to the point that is known and loved by fans.It is easy to blame the authors for the fanservice and the obvious play on the feelings of fans of previous franchises: without constantly heated rumors and hopes for the appearance of certain actors, the picture would not be so interesting. But in reality, such a film has a huge target audience. He will please your long-time relatives, many of whom Molina was one of the first screen villains, and fans of the entire amazing cast of actors, and even the younger generation. After all, for those who have become attached to the Spider performed by Holland, two more amazing spider universes are now opening up, which will never be continued - but they managed to return them from oblivion.", "Spider-Man is one of my favorite superheroes": "Spider-Man is one of my favorite superheroes, so I still found time to get out to the cinema.According to the plot, Parker's life became complicated after the disclosure of the secret of his identity. Someone considers him a hero, and someone is almost the most important villain. This harms not only Peter, but also his loved ones. To fix everything, he decided to resort to the help of a famous magician...The plot is, in principle, not bad and interesting, but logically it is not worth analyzing, there will immediately be a bunch of illogical places and moments. But this is the problem of many Marvel movies. On the other hand, with the simplicity of the plot, the film is quite fascinating, despite the fact that it runs for almost two and a half hours. This time is practically not felt, i.e. I left the cinema and realized from the surrounding environment (the number of people in the shopping center, the change in daylight) that a lot of time had passed, but I did not feel it in the hall.Of course, I won't say that the film is so exciting that you watch it \"in one breath\", no it's not. There are a lot of non-dynamic moments in it.", "Very nice": "I myself am a fan of Spider-Man movies with Tobey Maguire. I was terribly disappointed with the casting of his followers and only in \"The Avengers\" could I finally come to terms with the replacement of the performer. In some ways, Tom Holland looks like Tobey Maguire.", "Nostalgic and no more": "Yes, and it's the nostalgia that makes this film even better. Marvel as always on top, effects, plot and more.

I saw my childhood idol again, for which special thanks to marvel. For those who did not have time to watch it, I advise you to do it right now, the film was amazing.", "In my honest opinion, the best movie ever made": "There aren't enough words to describe my complex feelings about this film. I've always been a massive Spider-Man fan. For as long as I can remember, I've watched the films, read some of the comics, watched some episodes of the shows, I grew up with Spidey. Never in my 18 years of living, though, can I say that I have seen a single movie better than this.Spider-Man: No Way Home contains an amazing balance of humour, despair, happiness, and loss. I was in tears the entire time, whether that be from laughing or crying, both happy and sad. The score for the film is the best I've heard, and it fits amazingly well with the content of the movie. The fight scenes were well choreographed. Everything met and exceeded my high expectations.Now, the bit of this review where I talk about the fan-service.It is the only time fan-service was done amazingly well.We knew before the film came out that it would have 5 villains and it delivered on the promise. Seeing them on screen again was cool enough.Then, in came Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock. That was even better.BUT THEN, 2/3S OF THE WAY IN, THEY INTRODUCE TOBEY AND ANDREW.I have never, and I mean NEVER been as happy as I was in that moment. The entire theater cheered seeing them on screen. That scene made me laugh and cry at the same time for reasons I won't get into.The post credits scenes were amazing and innovative, too, but I won't spoil those. You need to experience THAT for yourself.Overall, this movie lived well up to the hype. I recommend this movie wholeheartedly to anyone, even people who aren't Spider-Fans. This is the best piece of cinema ever made, and it makes me extremely excited for the future of not only Spider-Man, but the MCU as a whole.", "Aleksandr": "When Spider-Man - a schoolboy, a child and a real troublemaker- gets into trouble again: Peter Parker's life collapses when Mysterio reveals his, Peter's, identity to the whole world.

Expected a great movie, However thought it was okay, kind of slow, a lot of crying by the characters. I've watched a lot of films and don't get all the hype around the MCU. Just elongated tv episodes of a comic book series. I'm not American, so maybe don't get their obsession with superhero's or celebrity worship but there are better stories and movies than this rated at 8.7?", "Expected to enjoy it, ended up loving it": "It's not often that a movie can exceed your expectations, despite the hype. Instead of cameos and fan-service, our old friends are actually IN this movie, and they're amazing. It left me excited for the next film, just as I was starting to feel that the Tom Holland spidey saga had overstayed its welcome.", "Yes Spiderman movie!": "Always a fan to Spiderman, this movie just like some dream come true when the 3 version merge into the movie. It's a little bit awkward to see the 3 of them communicate. But I think this movie is a little to short to develop the story into perfection.

Peter finally become a friendly neighbor as he said. He can't take the responsibility due to his weak mental abilities, although he is strong enough physically.However, I believe the spider-man will appear in the movie again, and this have also proven for the existence of spider-man in the post of the other Marvel movies.

It has the heart, the ambition, and the fan service we so desperately needed and wanted. SPOILER!: I absolutely love how they made the MCU Spider-Man be independent from the Stark Industries and have a place of his own, make his own costume out of cloth, and have his iconic fresh look with the classic spider! Also SPOILER: Me and the rest of my theatre was just amazed and out of words for the inevitible return of Andrew Garfield AND Tobey Maguire! And Somehow this wasn't the only thing that carried the movie. They redeemed Tom Holland's Spider-Man with the amazing cherography and story-dialouges. Loved the villian's chemistry with each other and Peter. And I was worried that they coudn't make Willem DaFoe's Green Goblin (who was drop-dead AMAZING) the classic arch-nemesis of Tom Holland's Spider-Man due to the fact that GG is from another universe. I am thrilled to announce that I have been wrong! Everyone did an amazing job in this amazing piece of a movie. I guess if I wanted to have a nitpick it would be that we didn't get to see Tobey and Andrew's Spider-Mans throw that many punches with the baddies but regardless of that it was still phenomenal. This movie and everyone involved in it knocked it straight out of the park. Subdued my doubts for the cliched MCU formula for now.

I can say for sure that this movie is in the better end of the spectrum. The jokes were funny, the story was good (huge Dr. Strange fan so seeing him was a bonus for me), and of course the CGI was good just like any other MCU movie.One thing I liked about this movie is that the producers new what the audience wanted. The three OG Spider-Man's taking down villains with cool visual effects. The jokes can sometimes can get too much in most MCU movies but I do not think it went over the limit in this one since the personality of the teenager group fits within the jokes and actions they make.Obviously the movie was not all fun and games, there was quite a bit of drama with the death of Aunt May and Peter Parker literally being erased out of everyone's mind. It also did kind of leave us in a cliff-hanger. If there is going to be another Spiderman movie, what is going to happen with no one in the world knowing who Peter Parker is?Overall, a great movie which has something for everyone although the younger audience would definitely enjoy it more 9/10 for sure. Not 10/10 just because I am being picky but definitely recommend it for a watch.", "Although I gave this movie a 7.5 points, it is indeed very exciting": "I don't understand what those people who give full marks are thinking.

But still a good watch.", "Great Movie, but not the best...": "Right, so I, like many others, am a massive spiderman fan. Toby, Andrew and Tom have all given me great spiderman experiences over the years, and I truly adore them all. Seeing them all come together after huge speculation was a delight and the conversations between them were priceless to say the least.However, I feel like Sony may have had one too many opinions when making this movie as it lacked its MCU quality in terms of fight scenes and character arcs. WHY ALWAYS IN THE DARK SONY!? Telling the spider.en apart in the final battle was soooo tough! And the shakey cam in the Tom/Willem fight actually pissed me off because I was struggling to follow the fight.This alongside the lack of character development in the movie is why this film isn't perfect. It has everything you want, but not EXACTLY as you'd have liked it, and sadly, not in a good way like we are used to with these movies surprising us in good ways.Of course I'm going to watch it again, and it is genuinely a great movie. Toby and Andrew stand out in such beautiful lights of their previous versions, and they both actually redeem their own story arcs in this movie which is fantastic. Especially Garfield catching MJ and Tobey stopping Tom from killing. Both beautifully executed and allowed those old doors to be closed.I have an incling that the DVD release will include MANY more scenes which will help tie the lose ends together.Also, DD catching a brick was perfect \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Spoilers*****Nostalgia wise, it's a 10/10, film wise, it's just a very good Marvel movie": "Exactly what I said above, for nostalgia/cameo's it's amazing, just nothing we've ever seen before. Film wise, it's very good, but they wasted every bad guy, ok, they had 5 to share the screen, but they were caught/beaten twice, quite easily. Sounds like I'm moaning about it, I am a bit, but I still really enjoyed it, but really don't know if I was really enjoying myself or if I was carried away with all the nostalgia stuff re: the other two spidermem (Overall, I really enjoyed it, and I was worried that the Flash would have a pretty hard time even matching this. But after watching, I have high hopes for it now, two batmen, two flashes, hopefully/maybe DC adding in a few reshoots, add a few more old characters, their version of the multiverse could be even better.I really hope this opens up the window for Garfield to get another shot at playing the role, for me he was the perfect SpiderMan who got shafted by Sony. Great to see him in the suit again.", "EPIC!": "It was perfect!Best tribute you could ask for the most celebrated Superior of all time \u2764Best Theatre Experience ever had since Endgame \u2764\ud83d\udd25Thank you Marvel for this masterpiece!\ud83d\udd77\n..\n.", "It's Not Just A Superhero Movie": "Oh god!...

There were many memes recreated & easter eggs were aplenty all through the movie. The supervillains collection was top notch. This is as close we'll ever come to getting a sinister 6 movie. The action sequences are amazing. The emotional scenes were the best since Spiderman 2. Willem Dafoe stole all the scenes he was in. I was so thrilled when Tobey hit the screen, it was a burst of Nostalgia. This movie was almos perfectly balanced. The ending was a bit depressing but still the good outweighs the bad aspects of the movie.", "One of the worst movies": "I have to say i wasnt expecting much but it was a huge let down anyway. Every second i wished that it would end.To say it lightly it was dumb and it didnt do anything new. It was just the same as all the others expectable boring and uninteresting.I knew marvel movies arent great but still this is probably a new low and i cant imagine that they could possibly get any lower than this even if they tried.This movie is ranking high on my least favorite movies list among dumb and dumber 2 and topgun.And the ending it was so unpredictable was it written by m night shyamalan.It might be that i just have something against bad generic movies getting more attention and praise than the better movies even though they are allways the same.", "Marvel outdid themselves AGAIN!": "I'll be honest I didn't think Marvel could pull off something that can surpass Infinity War and Endgame. I'm so happy I was wrong.It's always fantastic when Marvel follows cause & effect sincerely in their storyline sand No Way Home is the shiny exemplary masterpiece that proves how sincere story writing with genuine and thoughtful consequences can elevate the narrative and characters as they travel their said arcs.

I thought the fight scenes and the special effects were good, acting ok but the story just seemed to be playing the audience with forced drama and nostalgia and as a fan of the other films I was disappointed.I found the other films enjoyable and if this wasn't rated so high I might have just overlooked the flaws but the ratings and reviews on here are ridiculous. I don't think I laughed once, I predicted beforehand certain characters like doctor oc turning good but the way in which he easily got the better of the electric Jamie foxx was just laughable at such a crucial point, why would he believe he is still bad after witnessing him turn good.As for a deeper meaning with Aunt May convincing Peter to look for the good in people and try to help them, that's ok as a storyline albeit done 1,000,000 times before, there was no deep dialogue or action only a few 'cures' all these Spider-Man whipped up in half an hour and just like that they're sent back to their universe to live happily ever after and change the old Toby and Andrew timelines to which they appear from. It really is just a good idea of a multiverse being used so simply, nowhere near as good as the animated one.All in all I just find this film annoying to even think why it has such high ratings above films which are thought provoking and awe inspiring, into the spider-verse is one of my favourite films and I can say hands down it is not anywhere near the same bracket of films this Spider-Man belongs in. I was shocked to see it end because I was expecting so much more, I couldn't wait for it to finish, whereas a good film makes you never want it to finish.", "Good movie for nostalgic service but with massive plotholes": "First plot hole, Dr Strange is seems weak and not thinking properly in the movie. Cant he just shut peter up when casting the spell instead of ruining the spell? 2nd, Dr Strange cant steal a box from peter seriously? Cant he just use freeze spell or tie spiderman's hands from the body first (torso is not affected by spidersense) to get it while peter is in ethereal form?Seriously they made Dr Strange a clown here.Also some jokes are a bit forced and Filipino Fan service is too obvious (speaking tagalog part). Also drama is forced just too match other spidermen drama.Overall a fun movie because of cameos.", "Disappointingly average": "And so the poor film making continues.

I want to be invested in my characters, in a clear space/time reference. Although I consider myself a fan of the XMen I'm clearly not invested in the storylines after what they did. Although Logan is one of the greatest works of art ever.But we learn that Tobey Maguire's universe is not Tom Holland's. We learn that this isn't James Bond getting younger on the same planet. This is literally a different universe. 100% I do not like that. How can I invest in the lore and history if they can just \"Dr. Strange\" it to fit any plot idea that comes along?

It is the best crossover in the century also more like the number one movie in the film industry.", "Overreated": "Movie was ok but nothing special.Was nice to see that every one came back.For the rest a normal Marvel movie with nothing special in it.Oh yeah tobey maguire steals the show in this one.", "8,9?! C'mon this can not be real.": "I can not understand how can someone can say this is the best part of Spiderman.I felt like i was watching a movie for kids...But maybe that's why it has such a big scoore. All kids love the movie!", "Marvels Dark knight <3": "From now on this is my fev Spider Movie ever <3 Marvel Studio did it again after the endgame. The scene of aunt may was so emotional.Oh man & what i say about Team up that was bestest part of the movie. I love every second of the movie. Overall Hats off for a bombastic experience of 2021 Movie of the year <3.", "Great film, Broken Promises": "These are only my complaints, if you want to see the good reviews, read other people's.Straight off the bat, we get to see spiderman where he is not accepted in the community, he is the 'number 1 public enemy'. Peter's life is 'ruined' due to this. He is not accepted into college, he is not treated with welcome hands from New Yorkers. My issue with this concept, was that it seemed like it was forgotten in the second act, up until May's death, where we then see authorities act towards peter as if he was a criminal, by shooting him, threatening him, etc.The movie promised us a peter that would be ostracized from society, then instantly forgets about it.In my opinion, this is where the movie should have stuck to its darker tone. When the fight breaks out at Happy's condo, Tom Holland's Peter (Peter 1) begins to embrace an aggressive, reckless fighting style especially towards Goblin. It is similar to how Batman fought the Joker in the interrogation room in The Dark Knight when Batman found out that the Joker had both Rachel and Harvey captive. Batman does not hold back, nor does Peter 1. May dies shortly afterwards when Goblin stabs her with the glider, then later throws a pumpkin bomb. This provokes Peter 1 to have a lust for blood towards Goblin.At this point, it is safe to say that Goblin is the big bad. There are other villains but they are not as important to Peter 1.Long story short, after May's death, Andrew Garfield's Peter (Peter 3) and Tobey Maguire's Peter (Peter 2) meet with MJ, and Ned, then later Peter 1. The three Peters have a heart to heart, and decide that they will 'cure' the villains so that when they return to their universe, they will not die. The final battle ensues, with all villains arriving at the Statue of Liberty. Sandman, Lizard, And Electro all get cured by the 3 Peters, and a little bit of help from Doc Ock.At last the Green Goblin arrives, the boss finale. Peter 1 should still have a blood lust for him, which he does. They end up fighting hand to hand, Peter 1 still fighting with that aggressive, reckless style. It comes to a point where Peter 3 has to stop Peter 1 from killing Goblin. In doing so, Peter 2 gets stabbed. In my opinion, this is where Peter 1 should actually lose it. Goblin has killed his aunt, and it looks like he's also killed his friend. This is a very solid motivation to kill the Goblin. However, what happens in the movie is that Peter 3 throws the cure towards peter 1, then peter 1 cures the Green Goblin. Why? Why doesn't peter 1 want to finish the Goblin off. Why does Peter 1 catch the cure. Why doesn't he ignore it. At this point in time, Peter 1 is blinded. Yet the movie writes this off, and prefers the happy, good ending for peter 1, curing Goblin. In my opinion, it would have been better if Peter 1 still tried to kill Green Goblin, and the other 2 peters tried to stop Peter 1. It would have been better if either peter 2 or 3 delivered the cure. It would have been better if Peter 3 fends off Peter 1 after Peter 2 nearly succeeded to do so. The whole idea of Peter 1 wanting to cure Goblin is out of the blue.When Peter 1 began to hit Goblin continuously and lethally at Happy's condo, it should have been his turning/boiling point. So to revert back to the peter that we knew from the first two films and half of this film is confusing. It seems the writers have promised us a darker peter, then suddenly writes it off as if it didn't happen.Nevertheless, it was a great film and fun to watch, a lot of fan service, which isn't necessarily bad but definitely enjoyable nonetheless.", "Too much overhyped": "Lame comic timings, many questions unanswered, how can other spidermans come out of nowhere and even if they come the others should be coming as well,mj aunt may and all who knew peter was spiderman.", "second best mcu film": "I love this movie, this is a perfect spider-man movie for all the fans, but in now way is this better than infinity war. This movie does much more than the rumours says, but a lot of it was predictable as a mcu nerd.", "An amazing film, so close to endgame": "Definitely the film we all expected, even something more. Well constructed plot and not too long film. I don't feel like giving it a higher rating than Endgame, but we're a small step down.", "Oh delicious": "Okay, we might have a couple of easy ways to go with the script, so that the trama could move along, but it delivers what we wanted as fans, it does not desapoint, and allow us to expect a good newcoming side of Tom Holland's spider-man. And the nostalgia is just beautiful. Easily the best marvel film since Infinity War.", "My life is complete!": "I've been a fan of spiderman since i was 7 years old. Growing up spiderman was always by my side in one shape or a nother. Throughout the years we got to see 3 brilliant actors bring to life this amazing hero, each in their own way, and now seeing them all together laughing, sharing their experiences and of course fighting is literally EVERYTHING. Marvel and Sony in the name of all spiderman fans THANK YOU!!!!", "Cashing in on old characters and storylines, nothing new here": "The recent Spider-Man films have bought so many new, creative ideas, stories and characters to the table.Im talking about the first 2 Tom Holland Spidey's and Into the Spiderverse. Tom Holland has great character himself and the supporting cast in Micheal Keaton, Zendaya and Gylenhal were a breath of fresh air - Mysterio's adaption to the big screen was so clever and well executed.The Into the Spiderverse was stylistically incredible - it has the feels. The look; music, characters and emotion that were completely new to Spider-Man and an excellent tributes to the comics.No Way Home feels like it's set out to cash in on all of the above and shoehorn the great characters from the Sony Spider-Man's into the MCU without adding anything new. Writing this I'm trying to think of something new from this film and simply cannot.If you wished and imagined what would happen when these characters collided then you might think this is the film you'd been waiting for. But take a look at DC's Batman Vs Superman...we all know what happened there.Some things should remain \"what ifs\". If your your favourite past sporting heroes played against today's you'd be disappointed for real and this is a good analogy for this film. It's like Mike Tyson fighting Tyson Fury.It feels like Sony has had a board meeting and said \"into the Spiderverse did well, what about the multiverse\". It will pay off in the short term, I'm sure with big draw to the film, but people will stop coming back for more if there's no new content.The action is good and there's nostalgia there but if you were expecting the recent quality of Spiderman films, you'll be disappointed. As well as the lack of new ideas, the dialogue felt so weird and awkward, particularly in the first 2/3's of the film.This film is a copy/paste of the best lines from old movies - \"Hello Peter\", with no depth or new motives for the characters coming back. If you love nostalgia and those older Spiderman's, go and watch them in their glory rather than this mismatched, overrated new addition to the increasingly tiresome MCU.", "Tobey Maguire Rocks!!!!!!": "I loved the movie watched it twice...(planning 3rd)\nI screamed my vocals out in theaters..... when I saw my child hood hero back in action. And I cried\ud83d\ude2d.It all really Started with Tobey Maguire.(2002)\n...\nPlease give Sam Raimi's 'Spider man 4'\nAnd The amazing spider man 3.Make spider-verse....\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udf7e\ud83c\udf7e", "Yeah...it's worth watching": "All in all I'd say it's the best yet.Best Spider-Man movie.It largely has it all. Action, drama, tragedy and humour.Go see it on a big screen.Oh - and the spoilers aren't coming from me. I'm not giving you anything.Just go see it.", "Possibly the best Marvel movie ever made.": "This movie will take you to your knees crying, laughing and feeling everything you can from a movie. Half of the time I was shaking from all that this movie has to offer. An amazing way to end his first trilogy.", "Storyline is not good": "I want to tell that Spider Man storyline is not good because this movie has no sense. Like 3 Spider-Man if all the villain is Alive then why the gf of 2 Spider-Man is not alive if we change the past then feature will be automatically change like how the Spiderman become the world population superhero if he didn't fight with the enemy of the movie. I want to tell to marvel studio if you copie someone make it better than that now I never support marvel he is thinking to release a moon knight copied of dark knight.", "Best experience i have ever lived": "The film makes you feel joy, crying, sadness, goosebumps and enthusiasm at the same moment, as it brought together all the characters we loved in our childhood and all the Spider-Men whom we loved so much, and experiencing this movie in the theatres was the most wonderful experience I have ever lived in my life and the screaming of the audience wasn't annoying at all because you are screaming with them and feeling the adrenaline rushing inside your vains in many scenes like aunt may's death scene. It was the most realistic death that l've seen in movies so far. Getting hit by the glider, while bleeding out, causing the body to go into a shock state so all you feel is the adrenaline rushing through your body. Then when she says the famous \"with great power, must also come with great responsibility\" and falls to the ground while Peter is crying, is where the body's pain starts and causing her to die right there in front of Peter\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "All the hype is answered and THEN some!": "Not only does the movie give everything everyone wanted, it gives more!

Just go and roar in theaters.", "Power of having a well planned Cinematic Universe": "Spider-Man No Way Home is Entertaining and at the same time refreshing and nostalgic! A Rare combination. Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield, Jamie Fox, Willem Dafoe, and all actors who returned from old movies are ageless and timeless classics.", "Best mcu movie ever": "Best mcu Moive ever the return of the best actors for spider man Andrew and tobey the acting was amazing and the moive was incredible and thank u marvel for the best mcu moive ever.", "Missing Spidey": "Would have been a 9 rating from me if they had included the original live action Spider-Man, Nicholas Hammond.Also why does every Marvel film have to have the same formula, with a bug action scene at the end, and let's put it in a construction site.", "The ONE you've been waiting for! Beyond Expectations!!": "(I'm the last of the herd, if you haven't seen it, GO NOW! It's GOT to be seen in theatres!)I haven't signed in to IMDB in years. Over a decade, no reviews, etc. BUT MAN, I had to. After a sub-par second installation (Far From Home) to the franchise in this new Spidey trilogy, I was eager for the conclusion to make a full swing and redeem it.After watching the trailer, my Spidey senses were tingling. I had to see it. It exceeded the highest of high expectations! I was worried about concerning plot holes, weird concepts, but my fears were squashed. The acting was obviously brilliant. Tom Holland and Zendaya's chemistry was one for the ages. Tom had some growing up to do character-wise for his Spider-Man, and boy did he deliver. I was crying with him. He's grown as a tremendous actor, and I can't wait to see what role he lands next. There is no doubt more to come. Zendaya is a soft-note but astounding. Her acting chops have already been warmed up by The Greatest Showman and Euphoria. Jacob Batalon gave his best performance yet. Of course, the original villians were stellar. Gave you chills and brought you back to the mid-late 2000s. Of course, there was the smallest of eyebrows raised regarding a few of the villans' motives in this movie, in the long run it really didn't matter. There fate was sealed but was given new life. As Oprah said \"YOU GET A REDEMPTION ARC, YOUU GET A REDEMPTION ARCC\"After waiting over a month (I wanted to see it day one but work/covid) got in the way, it was WORTH the wait. The trio coming alive and well was a meme come to life. Life imitates art is what the say? That's what happened here. Writing was witty, sarcastic, and some tongue-and-cheek regarding the classic Spider-Man, and especially the \"amazing\" series. Andrew Garfield delivered. His Spidey story gets a well-needed redemption as his reprisal of his role. Of course, Tobey McGuire was a sight for sore eyes from the original Spidey lovers. Overall, the best Marvel movie to date, hands-down.", "Next level epicness": "I dont know what else to say except I have never left a cinema that totally and completely satisfied in my life. 10/10 best spider man film, best marvel film and best superhero film.

WHAT AN EXCEPTIONAL FILM!", "too much hype and you know why": "The film was fine, I was happy to see peter actually grow as a character and face the consequences of his actions, unlike in the previous films where everything is often fixed for him. Of corse, like most everyone, I extremely enjoyed the introduction of the multiverse and applaud Marvel for combining franchises in a way that no other movie has yet to do, it was truly exciting and entertaining. Unfortunately, most other aspects of this movie fell very flat for me, the comedy was bad and which is rare for Marvel, Tom and Zendaya have less than impressive on-screen chemistry, there are random storylines only made for plot convenience and many other problems with the story, pacing, and general quality of the film. These aspects are drowned out by the shiny appeal of nostalgia, its unfortunate that this is prioritized over a general well rounded movie. Perhaps there is something to be said about the all to popular trend in Hollywood that prefers easy remakes and sequels over new and original stories. Delivering on actors going back to their old roles is clearly a priority over general quality of this movie and it shows.", "A Tangled Web": "While No Way Home does a nice job of giving me closure on the previous Spider-Man films and sets up for further films in the Spider-Man series and the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I couldn't help but feel like there wasn't enough to make THIS movie particularly enjoyable or memorable.

Excited about Strange 2.", "Great Movie And I Cannot Wait For The Future Of Tom Holland's Spider-Man": "The main selling point for me of the film was Tobey Maguire's inclusion and it did not disappoint. I and a few other movie theaters cheered our lungs out when Tobey's Spider-Man finally showed up as well as Andrew Garfield's. Speaking of Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man, I loved his redemption and made me love his Spider-Man more after my dislike of his Spider-Man due to his only two films, especially the disappointing second film. The ending was beautiful because now we get to see Tom Hollands Spider-Man escape the title of \"Iron-Boy\" and finally into the real Spider-Man he is destined to be and I love how that unlike the other two previous incarnations of Spider-Man, his Spider-Man was the only one to choose how his Spider-Man life will be and where responsibility truly comes in.", "THIS IS THE SPIDERMAN WE WANT!": "100/10!

Willem Dafoe, I mean cmon now the guy still has it to play Green Goblin. Couple of other standout performances were Andrew Garfield's Spider-man I thought he was amazing (wink), Zendaya and Ned Leeds' mum for real.

I was met with the same bland Marvel formula and way too much fan-service for my taste. The concept was there, but the execution was terrible.", "Story isn't worth the time": "I've enjoyed the other recent Spider-man movies, but this one is just riddled with plot holes, character decisions that seem illogical and contrived for story purposes, and over-the-top nostalgia. Marvel and Hollywood in general are capable of better storytelling than this. No complaints about the visuals or acting, but what's the point without an authentic and well thought-out story?", "NWH Extended Review SPOILER ALERT": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is the best marvel movie ever created in my opinion!This film brings back all the familiar faces we have seen. There is Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, William Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Thomas Hayden-Church. Just about everybody!PLOT:The plot of the film is Peter Parker's secret identity is revealed. In an act of desperation, Peter turns to Doctor Strange where he casts a spell to make everyone on Earth forget he is Spider-Man. Peter distracts Strange mid-spell, making the spell go horribly wrong. The multiverse shatters bringing in all of Garfield's villains, most of Maguire's villains, and the iconic Spider-Men themselves!Ned, MJ, and Peter also aim to get into MIT. When realising none of them got in, Peter goes to the head of MIT (who is on the busy highway road) to convince her into letting them in. But Doc Ock appears on the bridge and battles Peter. Peter eventually defeats him and also gets a glimpse at Green Goblin, but is then transported to Sanctum Santorum (Doctor Strange's lair) where Doc Ock is held hostage for the time being.Doctor Strange sets up a work place for Peter, Ned, and MJ to catch any other visitors they may come across. Peter eventually catches all of the villains and Strange is holding the spell in a magical box in the meantime so he can work on it to send everyone home. But when Strange reveals to Peter that they will die in the hands of the retrospective Spider-Men, he feels bad for them and the two disagree with each other. So they fight in the mirror universe, Peter wins and traps Doctor Strange in the mirror universe (temporarily). Peter also decides that MJ and Ned should go off to Ned's mother's house so they can be safe.Later on, the villains are all in agreement to be helped and studied at Happy Hogan's secret bunker by Peter and Aunt May. That is until Norman, Electro and Sandman start to get suspicious and cautious which causes them to act out. The villains end up destroying a big chunk of the apartment block, Norman kills Aunt May (R. I. P), and Peter gets upset and goes to hide on a building.Meanwhile, Ned is wearing Strange's sling ring he stole from earlier and says out loud that he wishes that Peter would come back and ends up opening a portal to Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man! Garfield comes through the portal. Ned then tries to summon Peter again but then ends up opening a portal to Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man! Garfield, Maguire, MJ, and Ned all explain what is going on.Back to where Peter is mourning, Ned and MJ find him and comfort him. Garfield and Maguire meet Holland where the three share their life stories and what made them the people they are today. They all go to a laboratory to work on curing and stopping each villain. Peter then goes to the top of the Statue of Liberty where he live streams his story with JJJ and invites the villains to come and fight them and get the magic box they want to prevent them from returning to their universes. The three Spider-Men are all united and revealed to be on the newly built Statue of Liberty, Ned and MJ stayed back for safety.Holland, Garfield, and Maguire VS Electro, Sandman, and Lizard.

Ned accidentally opens up a portal to the Statue of Liberty where the Lizard gets through and tries to steal the magic box, Holland tells the two to run through the portal and get away. Holland and the Lizard both fight each other, the Lizard and Holland take the fight back onto the Statue of Liberty. But the Lizard continues to chase Ned and MJ for the magic box.Ned and MJ continue to run from the Lizard, Ned opens a portal to the mirror universe where Doctor Strange is released from. Strange takes the box and works on reversing the spell. Holland takes down the Lizard and turns into Curt Connors again. Strange almost finishes the spell but then... The Green Goblin returns and all three Spider-Men attempt to hold off Goblin. All attempts fail, when the Goblin throws a pumpkin bomb into the magic box BLOWING IT UP which makes some of structure fall apart, the shake of the vibration makes MJ fall.

Andrew Garfield sees this unfold, where he dives in at the last second and saves MJ's life.Once safe on the ground, Garfield cries since he couldn't save his girlfriend but he could save his other counterpart's girlfriend. The morning dawns and it is Holland VS Green Goblin. The two get into a violent fight where Holland knocks him to the ground and is about to kill him with a broken part of his goblin glider, but then... Tobey Maguire gets in front of it and stops Tom Holland from doing so, the two both try to resist each other. Holland gives up and throws the glider aside. But then... Goblin stabs Maguire in the back! Maguire falls to the ground in pain. Green Goblin starts to get up, but Andrew Garfield throws Tom Holland the Goblin cure, which Tom injects into Green Goblin's neck. Therefore defeating The Green Goblin. Andrew Garfield helps Tobey Maguire up.Holland swings over to Strange, purple lights fill the sky as the multiverse shatters. Strange reveals he can't stop other entities coming through, only very temporarily delay them. Holland suggests that he makes everyone forget he is Spider-Man again, that way the entities won't come after him due to them not remembering Peter Parker's identity. As sad as this is, Holland accepts his fate. Strange gets the spell ready, Holland says farewell to him.Holland swings back down to Tobey Maguire & Andrew Garfield where it is revealed Maguire will be okay! They all share a final moment, and they all hug. Holland then swings off to see Ned and MJ where they have their final moments.

Spider-Man: No Way Home is a cinematic masterpiece!", "Huge plot Holes": "The Movie is fun to watch.Tom Holland is great in Evert single second of the movie.The plot it's just a huge well done fan-service thing, poor of explanations.", "Best Among Holland's Spider-Man Movies": "To say there is an insane amount of action and storyline happening in this movie would be an understatement! However, to compare this movie with juggernauts like Endgame and Infinity War is just foolish. For me, it could easily crack the top 10 of the MCU movies. The team-ups in this movie, charisma of the leading characters and surprises are just unbelievable!", "One of best movie I have ever seen": "This movie bring back past memories and make me love spider man more. Cant say with word how much i love this movie. One of best movies i have ever seen to date. And will be remembered life time. And gonna watch so many time agin. Cant wait to get bluery.", "Worth a Watch for Old Spider-man fans": "The movie is sub par with a plot that technically has plot holes but the dominating presence of the other spider-man's is enough to make this movie very enjoyable.", "This movie is INDEED worth the hype!!": "{no spoilers}Usually, when movies get loads of hype, I personally think they're overrated!However with this movie, it was not the case!!100% the best movie of 2021; maybe even the best movie in the last couple of years!I watched this movie in ScreenX and it definitely made a difference! With this sort of movie, it was so immersive, especially during the action scenes!I experienced every emotion watching this movie; sadness, shock, happiness, excitement - the list could go on!I didn't want to leave this cinema, it was that good! I would happily have watched 2 more hours of this film!What I loved about this movie, was that it wasn't just the acting that was great, but it was everything; the script and story, the VFX, the special effects, the stunts, the music/score, the overall pacing of the movie (it wasn't slow at all!)... and so much more.For those of you who haven't watched the movie already, you are in for a treat! This movie is AMAZING! It's one of those movies where you wish you could watch it for the first time again!Last note: I would say that it would be good to have an understanding of the other Spider-Man movies and their stories before watching this movie though!", "interesting": "This movie is really amazing, I like it so much. There are many things present here from where we can learn positive things. I will love to recommend every individual to watch this amazing beautiful movie.", "Great movie and nice story": "This is a movie made purely to satisfy the fans and there should be no doubt about that. No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland. The visual effects too were top notch and the editing was stupendous. Two and a half hours flew by real quick while watching this popcorn action entertainer. It won't be fair to reveal anything, so here I conclude my review, and recommend you to check out this new world of Spidey-ness on the big screen and in 3D. And once you've seen it, please don't spoil it for others.it is an best movie i have been watch.", "Incredible!": "Many fellas cried in the theatre, I was full of tears in my eyes, I love every characters in the film, villains hug with Spider-mans, they did it, until now I still cannot believe they did it.", "BEST Spiderman Movie Yet!!!": "Really portrayed the hardships of Peter Parker with May's Death in this movie which is what I've been waiting for it's a great closing for this trilogy, excited to see more of Tobey and Andrew's Spidermen in Future Projects.", "Real Spider-Man": "I love how Spider-Man had truly become the \"real\" Spider-Man. In the previous stories he learned how to use his power, but in this story he learned how he had to take a great responsibility for the power, even if it was at the cost of the lives of the people he loved. In the end of the movie, Peter Parker, potrayed by Tom Holland, gave us some kind of \"maturity\" and \"dignity\" aura that he didn't have in the previous MCU films.", "A nerd orgasm": "Loved the movie but I have my complaints. The appearances were AWESOME but I felt the plot was stupid. The plot could have been changed a bit to be much less annoying/stupid.", "This is the very 'Amazing Spider-Man' !": "\"Amazing,\" I shouted again and again while watching this film. This totally amazing movie is one of my favorite ones. On the contrary, some people claimed that this movie was relatively less interesting than other episodes. However, I'm quite sure that this is the best one in this series. For many fans who have watched the Spider-Man series, this film provides you with a fully entertaining time.The CG/VFX scenes are astonishingly immersive and bring you to the Spider-Man world. On top of that, all of casts are exceptionally talented. In addition, the storyline is extreamly impressive. Therefore, I eventually cried at the end of this film. Overall, I firmly convinced that this film had already successed at the time when the director had choosen the casts and producer.Whether you have watched the other series of Spider-Man or not, this is highly recommended.", "My first review: I wish i could erase the movie out of my head just so i can rewatch it!": "I don't usualy write reviews. I am a maniac whenit comes to watching movies, and i mostly watch slow movies (drams etc.), but growing up as a spiderman-fan myself I had to watch this movie. And all i have to say is, the HYPE IS TOTALY WORTH IT!Go watch it! Now!!I loved every second of it. Comedy, emotional rollercoasters, action and nostalgy. Every thing is so thought-out.

Probably one of the best mcu films I have ever watched. There are just so many surprises that I can't even fully process what happened! The movie is worth everything, the hype, the price of tickets, and it's just a really great movie. My emotions during that film were all over the place! If you have been watching marvel movies for a few years (or even a few months) it is such a important movie because it opens up more in the mcu, meanwhile bringing back some classics. Props to the actors, set managers, directors, and producers because they did an amazing job and really made the movie touching and enjoyable.", "Boring!": "Damn how is that possible? Its sooooo F boring, pure garbage. I needed 3-4 sessions to watch until 1h 33min and im a goddamn marvel freak ^^ maybe its gonna be better but i dont think ...", "Best trilogy!": "I have always loved Tom's spider-man and I always wanted for people to see that as well. They have been comparing him with Tobey and Andrew and kept saying he's the worst (or not as good as them). After NWH, I'm so happy that Jon Watts finally showed them that Tom is just as good as them and deserves to be people's favorite and everything about Homecoming and Far From Home lead to this moment, to all of the emotions and heartbreaking moments. No Way Home is a very avengers-level film and Jon Watts showed how brilliant he is.", "BEST MARVEL MOVIE YET!": "Marvel has really outdone itself. The most ambitious movie since Avengers: Endgame. Incredibly emotional, and full of surprises. A must watch! As far as Spider-Man movies go, this is absolutely the best one.", "Spider-Man trio": "The way three Spider-Mans interact with each other is awesome... By the magic of Ned, first Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man came, then eventually Tobe Maguire's Spider-Man. They helped Tom Holland's Spider-Man a lot...At the end of the movie, Tom Holland's Spider-Man started living in a small apartment in NYC and he's Spider-Boy any more; He is mature enough to be Spider-Man!!!", "BEST MCU MOVIE!": "A short review: MY GOD I CANNOT STOP THINKING ABOUT IT!

WHAT A DAY MAN!", "I can't believe they pulled it off": "I was cynical that they could do this. And they did. It is now my favorite marvel movie to date. The reason it's not 10 star is because of power continuity between Strange and Peter. \"It's just geometry\" but I'm being nit picky. Otherwise it shines, excellent use of supporting characters both hero and villain.", "G.O.A.T": "No Spoiler review of No way home straight from theaterThis Movie is Beyond imagination\nSo before watch this movie, your expectations should be at the peak of Mount EverestStory: Continuation of Far from home,The plot take lots of Twists until end and many more that you can't process this at once.

The first half is fast-paced and full of great action scenes. The second half is also great but little disappointed with the action in the second half. In the Second half lot of focus was on fan service and nostalgic moments and because of that action seemed dull. There are a few small loopholes in the story but you will not realize that while watching a movie. Anyway, it's the best marvel movie of 2021. Probably the best MCU movie after Avengers endgame and Avengers Infinity War.", "Thank you": "I've never felt this way while watching a movie in 2021, especially the ending\ud83d\ude2d.

It was been in huge hype even before releasing. Especially the rumour that Andrew and Toby are also gonna be in the movie. Personally, I thought It was gonna be fake. But, after watching that movie I can assure you that it's the best thing in 2021. I mean the scene where Andrew and Toby entered in the Portal it was really a tear catching scene. It was so nostalgic for the fans who grew up watching them. Dr. Octavious, Green Goblin, Lizard, Sandman and Electro played a huge role in the movie they made the movie exciting. It was also good to see that Tom's spiderman matured. Ned and MJ also matured and helped peter. And Peter got the hurt by the death of Aunt May that definetely made him tough. Strange also played a huge role. Overall great movie.", "Best Spidey film!": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is hands down the best Spider-Man film ever made. This was worth the wait.

Got goosebumps.", "Overhyped Typical Super Hero Movie.": "Watched the movie after seeing the rating as 8.8. Really Disappointing Nothing too good just a hero fighting villains which were caused because he messed up.Doctor Strange and Spiderman fight was just for the hype i mean strange is a wizard with enormous power and he can't stop a man in a spider suit and also Ned (spider chair guy ) can OPEN a portal using Dr. Strange ring (What?) seriously what it took Dr. Strange months of practice to achieve that and Ned just revolved its hand and bam portal opened.Honestly 5 star is just right.", "Better than all Batman movies": "It's just better.

All The Actors Have played heir Role Very Well. I Have Been Watching Spider Man Movies Since i Was 2-3 Years Old and This Movie Brings Back So Many Memories. Crazy $h/t Happens in This Movie.

S :- I Still am Getting Goosebumps Imagining My Reaction in the Theatre. SO EXCITING !!! )", "Nothing like the comics": "I've been reading Spider-Man comics since 1976 and simply put this is not the spider man I know and love.For starters Spider-Man takes of his mask at every opportunity and for the majority of the film, even the action sequences Spider-Man fights his opponents maskless. He never ever fought maskless and by the end of the film I was sick to death of Tom Hollands face and his whole snivelling characterisation of Spider-Man.Peter Parker worked as a freelance photographer at the daily bugle also a student at college where he had a rivalry with flash and a girlfriend called Mary Jane, who by the way had red hair, I've no idea why Mary Jane was black I suppose it's to box tick the woke agenda and keep the progressives happy, you know the ones that have never read a Spider-Man comic in there entire lives but think they know everything about Spider-Man.A very disappointing portrayal of a much loved character, I probably think Stan lee would be turning in his grave I know the real fans are.", "More than expected": "I'm more of an X-Men and mutant lover but have definitely loved the MCU since the beginning especially with outstanding hits like the Guardians franchise, the Captain America trilogy and the whole Infinity Saga in general but never in my life would I have thought a Spider-Man film could be my favourite Marvel movie, and yet here I am... Paying homage to the deep rich history of the Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man and the many other elements in the Marvel universe, No Way Home delivers a pack of a punch in comic nerdgasms and I can't wait for the next instalment when the story of Doctor Strange continues in the Multiverse of Madness!", "I love you 3000": "My heart is full.

I like to watch the theme of the old movies of spiderman in this movie but we just watched a teenager movie with its not funny comedy theme. All of the old movie's characters were trying to be funny! No drama in this movie. It's just a typical Tom Holland spiderman movie.", "Remember the past, embrace the future.": "A reboot inside a reboot.

I think tehy should find a better villain instead of the old ones. The scenes were well maid but predictable. Tom was a big mistake as spiderman. They could've found someone way much better. This is my opinion. Im sorry if you're a tom fan.", "Such a movie!!": "The best and the dearest super hero movie of all time , everything was perfect the characters,the story,the end scene was just perfect .Some of the scenes was childish and the cgi was bad but I liked the movie because like said everything in this movie was great and the acting was on fire ,willem dafoe , tom holland , Jimmie Foxx, alfred molina , they were very good at They're rules .The film broke the rule of multiplicity of opinions, because the film was liked by all of its fans, because the film was originally intended for its fans. If you are not a fan of spiderman, you will not like the film.", "Amazing from Start to Finish!": "No Spoilers!It is my favourite Spider-Man movie, story is very clever and Spider-Man fans will appreciate it.

It will just blow your mind. \"And obviously you guys know, which actor is the best Spiderman in the whole Spiderverse\" \"old is gold\",proves himself yet again. Awesome story, fantastic editing. You will be on the edge of your seats for this roller coster ride. One point of advise, please watch it in IMAX (3d) or P (XL) (3d) screens for an immersive experience.

So, sit for 5-10 more minutes after the movie ends twice, you will thank me later. \" \ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\ude0e", "Best Marvel Film Since Endgame!": "This film was so great. There is no other way to put it. This movie blew the minds of thousands and that can be understood by the amount it made in the Box Office. Although you should probably keep up with all Marvel films to end up watching this one to better understand it, it's the most action-packed and suspenseful film, in my opinion, since Endgame!", "Multiverse and mirrored dimension": "Lots of action, but utter confusion when it comes to the multiverse and mirrored dimension. The concept of the deal doesn't make clear the position that this concept deals with deep magic and can be very dangerous if used by people who don't understand the real risks.", "I just Cant feel My Throat\ud83d\ude16": "Every second was Cheer worth and I swear you gonna love that and be amazed forever......\nTom on other hand did a great job and as in the trailers the actions were at great peak and was a furious way to see everything happen...

I don't know why so many positive comments and feedback for this show.", "Grand slam!": "The first two of this Spider-Man trilogy were fairly easy to digest and lighthearted films to set the base of the character while also giving us some good action. But this third film was the icing and cherry on top of an amazing Spider-Man cake! From all the returns bringing us nostalgia from previous franchises, to setting up the future of the MCU in a great way, this film had me on the edge from start to finish. We laughed, cried and cheered for the guy all through the film. And in the end they tied it all together in what I believe is the best way possible. Peter Parker looses so Spider-Man can win. And it's a perfect bow on this final film of the trilogy. Can't wait to see where they go from here.", "One of the best": "I have to say this movie is definitely one of the greatest and most ambitious superhero movie to date. There may not be as many hero's on the screen at one time like other movies, but the way they bring everything together in the movie is genius and ambitious. I haven't felt pure excitement and joy watching a superhero movie since Avengers Endgame, and NWH hits the nostalgia feels hard. Me being only 24, I was a little little kid watching Tobey swinging on the big screen, and in my heart he will always be the OG Spider-Man. Everyone's performance is outstanding including Defoe, and Garfield. Defoe as green goblin is still to this day amazing and terrifying at the same time with no effects, he does it all with his voice and facial expressions. The green goblin (Defoe) steals the show as the villain as green goblin. This movie is 11/10 and I am definitely going to go and see it again if not a couple times while it's in theaters.", "A Great Movie, That Was Dissapointing": "Spider-Man: Now Way Home was a great and very enjoyable movie that serves it's fans very well, when it was at its best. Unfortunately, when the movie is not at its best, it's wasted potential and boring. Going into the movie I was excited and expecting a grand fight, emotional punches, but most of all, it would deliver the same charm that Into The Spider-Verse did. The last fight felt underwhelming, belonging in the second act. There was a lot of emotional punches, but the movie would have done itslef a favor by keeping the whole \"forget Peter Parker\" thing out of the movie. This leads me to say, the ending was disappointing, as I feel it would've ended better with the multiverse just exploding, having the last fight be grand and epic, and going immediately into the next Doctor Strange movie. It did, however, bring the Spider-Verse charm as all three Spider-Men we're the highlight of the entire film. Overall, it was a fun movie and enjoyable experience and a movie I will definitely watch again, but watching it dissapointed.", "WITH GREAT CROSSOVERS COME GREAT MOVIES!!!": "Oh man,,,, we knew what marvel can do with epic crossovers (i really don't think someone needs to be reminded about infinity war and endgame) ...... but this time they created something even better.....Imagine the emotions and goosebumps you got from the few last moments of endgame,Now multiply it by 10.Then distribute it all, all over the movie.You've got yourself a Spider-Man : No Way Home!!!!I do think in some parts the action could have been better, but boy did they make it up for it in the rest of the movie!!Everything single thing was top-notch!!!", "Best Spiderman movie ever": "You don't need to read the reviews for watching this movie.

This film doesn't have a wasted moment, you feel everything that Peter is going through. I never thought that they would be able to bring this many characters together and not waste any of them.

I think the writing was good and the producing was also amazing. Overall Really good.", "Made little sense": "All he does is screw everything up. Instead of trying literally anything else, immediately resorts to doctor strange to get his friends into college. When the multiverse gets screwed up, he rounds up all of the villains from other dimensions just to let them all go free. He straight up saw them put innocent lives in danger and knew they were enemies of spiderman but lets them walk around unrestrained. He gets aunt may killed and probably other people from the collateral damage. Then instead of using the cube to send everyone back to their own dimensions, he wastes time making cures while they're out there doing god knows what. Then when the universe is falling apart peter tells doctor strange to make everyone forget about him to stop it and strange tells him no??? The stakes were the highest at this point in the movie and now he's not okay with it? Makes no sense. The movie tries to get you to feel sad for peter but everything was just a result of his own incompetence.", "WAY BEYOND THE EXPECTATION": "I love how this movie brought me to all different types of emotions on point; the funny, sad, mad, excited, happy feelings, like all of them!It's very entertaining to watch for the whole 2 hours.Tom Holland played the role PERFECTLY and so did the all other casts. The editing, the sounds, all are great.Nothing more to say, just watch it guys.

I was thought Tom Holland will against all of the villians from the other spiderman universe all alone.... And then... Welp, Ned (aka Jacob Batalon) created a portal where Ned and MJ met Andrew Garfield, and he did the same thing to Tobey Maguire. I think this is the best scene, apart from seeing them fought together. Also, when i was watching the movie, i was feel there's something missing... It's feel like, something's missing... and yes.. i just remembered that Venom wasn't there at the time of the fight... even though he's only seen in the post credits, bruh. Welp at least My curiosity was satisfied, and the rumors were true. When in fact I had resigned if Tom Holland would fight his enemy alone...", "Best movie movie of the year": "I love the idea to combine all Spider-Man's movies to one move and give a such idea of believing of youth wisdom with little push of old confidence which can change the futures ... I loved it and I will watch it again and my kids loves it and they can wait some games videos which it will let you play like this awesome move.", "Nostalgia, Goosebumps, Imax Magic": "When is the last time you see people in theater literally shouting, clapping, whistling on their favourite moments and believe me there are plenty of such moments\nThe moment we spidi fans are waiting for so long is here and man does it deliver?

Its kinda hard to escape from Spoliers, as you wait longer and longer.Thus watch it as soon a possible and enjoy the feeling of surprises and goosebumps.", "For marvel fans": "The plot was alright, definitely surprises for spiderman fans. Lot of nostalgic scene. Wouldn't say this is the best marvel can do, the ending is kind of meh. I expect more than this from marvel.", "SpiderMan": "It is tribute to the previous spiderman and villans. It is a epic spider man movie and the second half is totally wonderful. I loved it. The acting is very brilliant and the humour correctly suite for the scenario.", "Topped all the expectations": "Mass entertainer, there is every thing in the movie,best Spiderman movie ever made till now, expectations are much more higher for the next one. The fight scenes were so good, everything was over the top.", "Fairly entertaining - for most part...": "The Multiverse theory became quite popular in past years. So much - that it kinda feels like a trend at this point. For example... not so long ago - we had another Marvel Comics adaptation, the series... \" What If...?\" Not to mention - the other Spider-Man movie (well - an animation) - from 2018... Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. And yet... all of above titles proved to be quite successful. Fortunately, same can be said about Spider-Man: No Way Home. For most part - at least...The thing is - this movie had a lot of good actors - who lived-up to their name (or hype - if you will). And since this story revolves around the Multiverse - we got to see the protagonists and the villains from 2 other Spider-Man Movies - doing a better job in this one than their original titles.The visual experience (filming) - was pretty clean as well. There was a lot of CGI but it wasn't cluttered content (a common issue while using CGI - the wrong way). Even tho it wasn't perfect or realistic enough - for most part - was pretty well put together (easy to discern - which tends to be a key factor for Good CGI vs Bad CGI - that's usually cluttered and confusing).Last but not least - the plot was fairly entertaining. And again... for most part - the story line - really worked. Except for some major plot-holes here and there (the type you'd see in a mainstream cartoon - logic wise). More specifically... the end (or last 10% of the movie) - felt really rushed. As I kept mentioning above \"for most part\" - they did a good job... so the ride was pretty good (over all) - but they kinda ruined the climax - with such a poor logic (feels so rushed cause of the way the handled those details... stuff that normally would take years to resolve or even near impossible to achieve by a scientist - be it a prodigy in its field - yet, our protagonists managed that in a day with whatever they could find / you'll get what i mean - if you watch/watched the movie). But hey, logic aside... for fans of the genre and children in particular - this movie can be labeled as a good watch.", "GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME": "The effort and time put into this movie is absolutely phenomenal. Tom Holland and many other actors in the rest of the cast put on a brilliant show, with a lot moments where there may be sad emotion, excitement and humour. I'm pleased with how amazing the visuals look, especially during the sequence in the mirror dimension. Spider man No Way Home compares really closely to Avengers Infinity War, my all time favourite movie, and this shows how John Watts, the director, has upped his game massively. In my opinion, the MCU spider man one and two movies were good, however doesn't compare to this. Once again, this movie is brilliant and I can't wait to see what happens in the future.", "Spiderman nwh first watch review (no spoilers)": "Yesterday, I got to watch spiderman nwh. I am still not sure what to think but I'll say this. They handled the large amount of characters so very well, the visuals are the best I've seen in a spiderman movie ever, the writing is great, the action is amazing and everything is is just well thought out. But, in some way, this movie felt empty. The story is good for what it is, absolutely, But it's a kind of story that is just.. I don't know.. it felt \"disconnected\". And this might be a good thing! It's very different from what we've seen, and feels like not a lot is going on, the story is again, just what it is, and maybe because we knew so much about the film is why I feel that way. Take any movie, for example.. Thor Ragnarok. It has different scenes that some are to serve purpose x and some to serve purpose y. In nwh, this is cut down, in a good and bad way, guess I'll have to watch it again and again untill I decide for sure.Anyway, go watch this movie - it is the first one I can truly say, is a movie about spiderman, purely. This was like the birthday cake you accidentally seen in the fridge too early but then finally got to eat it, feeling like you knew what it tastes like, but not exactly because you never actually tasted it before. And everything about it is really great, but it is just a cake after all.. And then, OMG I need to eat it again.....", "Pure satisfying movie": "This movie is just awesome.

The villains of the film were ignored, the creators and writers could have added a new super villain to the story, which unfortunately they did not do, I personally prefer away from home to this, my score for this film is 6 out of 10.", "Worth every pennyy!!!!": "Wow what ride it was...

It felt so surreal to see all 3 actors together and the way they redeemed themselves was truly heartbreaking, Tobey saves Norman Osborn because he couldn't in the first movie, and Andrew saves MJ because he couldn't save Gwen and scene where they all point at eachother in the Lab... man, Sony did what the fans wanted and now everyone is happy!", "Almost perfect": "This is definitely the best Tom Holland Spider-Man movie, however there are some things that keep it from being amazing. One of the main things that I don't like is the the main Spider-Man crew, by this I mean Peter (Tom Holland), Ned, and MJ. I find each one of them have their own annoying problems, Peter is kind of dumb, MJ is rude and unlikeable, and Ned is just irritating. However these can be overlooked because the movie is still good. Having all of the previous Spidermen was an incredible idea and is easily the best thing about this movie as well as having returning villains. All the returning characters' performances were fantastic and I really enjoyed it. I do feel like if Toby and Andrew showed up earlier and had more fight scenes then it'd be better.

Everything in the movie was flawless and we are proud to be a able to speak highly of your movie. Keep up the great work sony!!?!!", "Great action, alright story, VERY meh ending": "This movie was supposed to be amazing, unfortunately, it was overhyped.The thing is, spiderman movies never had a great movie with a ton of villains in it, trying to cram each plot point in there just creates an atrocious mess that people call a movie,The beginning was promising enough, I liked how Peter tried to be really nice to the villains, and doctor octopus was probably the most likable character, and willem dafoe managed to keeps some of the flare the original goblin had.Then it all went down to crap, killing off aunt may is not a substitution to uncle Ben, and trying to slightly alter spiderman's motives just didn't work in the slightest.But Andrew and Tobey were probably one of the greatest part of the whole movie, unfortunately, that's pretty much all it has.And making everyone forget who Peter Parker was? I understand plot wise, but WHY?The action scenes were great, typical Spider-Man stuff, but somehow I thought it was a bit lackluster.Overall, completely fine as is, but not a great spiderman movie, 5 out of 10.", "Hard to say.": "This movie is grate . It could be better if there were little bit more actions of Tobey Spidey.Film was awesome and enjoyable . Also we saw a serious side of Tom. How ever this is good.", "spider man": "I've been watching Spider-Man since I was a kid. I consider the cartoon \"Spider-Man: Across the Universes\" to be the most ambitious work. I was waiting for a new \"Spider\", as we were promised to return the famous villains. Know! The promises were fulfilled, I enjoyed these moments.I will try to describe the impressions of the film without spoilers, because the picture has something to surprise and please. Firstly, the film starts at the same place where the previous one with Holland ended)\nOne can speculate on whether this is the best film from the Marvel film studio. Unfortunately, no, \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" surprised much more and captured \"my world\". Most likely it would have been an ordinary movie if not for the beloved childhood heroes, that is , Dr. Octavius , Defoe and so on.The main thing is that Spider-Man has not lost his life position and character of the character. The film is emotionally charged, but some scenes will make even men cry!The actors played their best. Holland's acting has also improved - the actor has something to play. But the real cherry on the cake is Willem Dafoe, he remains as scary as he was twenty years ago.Objectively, the work lacks the integrity and the dramatic intensity that was present in the 2018 cartoon.Therefore, if you evaluate the film soberly, without a touch of nostalgia, then it deserves an 8-point rating.", "A piece of art": "The movie is magnificent, the action, acting, surprises and ending. The movie is by far the best spiderman movie of all time, I didn't enjoy it as much because I saw 3 spiders in the theater \ud83d\ude33", "No way you need to watch this.": "This is one spoiler alert you are better off reading before you head to the movies.I am no fan boy. But a father of one. And my fan boy was digusted after watching this movie.Just because they bring 3 different casts of spiderman into one movie is no reason to make a movie or even watch one.1 Star each for that.You are better off watching the 3 different sets of Spidey movies once again instead of going through this ordeal.No creativity, no fun. Just wonderful marketing to make this a 9 * movie on IMDB.", "I just love it": "Grapic are realy good i m waiting for next spider man man moive i just love it. Tom acting is crazy zendya is goood and the villan are very very suprising and realy wanted venom there marvel make spider man bigger bigger\nMarvel moive are carzy moives.", "Spider threesome": "This movie is absolutely amazing beyond expectations, I really didn't think it would be this good,i mean the band of villains was one thing but adding spider Man characters from the previous spider Man movies (Spider-Man & the amazing spider Man) was really what turned me on, you guys really outdone yourselves this time in making this movie I give this movie a solid 8/10.", "Loved the movie": "This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman. I loved every second of it!", "ONLY MCU fans will love this movie.": "So, first of all. I was really looking forward to the movie since I've watched every marvel movie (except captain America, can't stand the guy). Yes, Marvel movies usually are at times over the top and some fight scenes lack tension, since characters fighting seem kind of indestructible. And honestly, I like that, since you can just relax and have fun watching the movies whenever feeling bored and lazy.So now that I've established where my opinion on Marvel movies stands on, let me get to the actual review of this movie and why I decided to rate it below average.Although the movie is a great fan service with fantastic scenes and with some good old familiar faces returning. \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" lacks depth/originality, unlike some other MCU movies. This film will definitely NOT feel the same if watched as a standalone movie, or even as a trilogy. Meaning you have to watch most of the Marvel movies/series to connect to the characters better and understand references in the film.Speaking of references, there are just too many of them in the movie. At one point I actually got mad/bored since they didn't develop the plot forward and kept showing characters that had previously been unused in \"Avengers\". Which kind of screams that they're planning on something big. Sadly in time the hype created by references and collaborations will fade, but the movie forever remains the same: lacking plot movement and originality.All in all, the movie was still watchable and had its moments. But in my humble opinion definitely not one of their better ones. Plus the movie itself is pretty boring for non-MCU fans, which doesn't attract more audience.I'd rate this 5/10, BUT I'm kind of disappointed, that they didn't use the \"Loki\" series plot here on multiverse (for one more itsy-bitsy tiny little extra reference). Real talk though, since they already went all in on \"must watch other stuff before you understand this, peasant\". It would've been kind of cool to have realities collide out of nowhere in the middle of the movie and leave everyone confused. But I guess that's more of an Avengers level threat!? ;)", "New fav movie": "10/10 i love every thing about the movie.Acting, quality,story.I recommend you watch it in the cinemas as soon as possible.Tom Holland really nailed it.", "ABSOLUTELY UNBELIVEABLE!!!": "The entire movie, from start to end, is chaotic and I can't stop just thinking about the entire movie. It has so many unexpected surprises. YOU WOULDN'T WANNA MISS!", "Well, good movie for spiderman fans not for marvel though": "Warning, spoilers ahead:The premise of the movie was the devastating reveal of spiderman's identify and it looked to be a tough one to get out of but it seemed that it was almost over when there were no legal issues and seemed it will be over but no they could not get into college, like that was an Avenger level threat for Doctor strange to invoke such a dangerous spell. To me, this movie was made in a rush to introduce the multi verse and to take spider man out of Marvel future movies. Now that he is living as an unknown guy to all people, sony has the option to shape it howsoever they want. That can reboot it totally and to top it off they did give a hint that venom will be the villian in next movie. Now to explain the title, it was really great to watch tobey and andrew reprise there respective roles and frankly I liked andrew in this movie compared to his two amazing spiderman movies. And well, tobey there are no words to describe when he first appeared, it was a delight to watch all three working together. So again, basically it was a joy ride for spiderman fans but for marvel they have lost a very key hero.To summarise, I would love to see solo spiderman movies but I did not like how trivially Doctor strange cast that spell which wrecked havoc and was totally unnecessary just to introduce multi verse and to forget spiderman from the MCU. Loki, introduced multi verse rather very eloquently, this was haphazard. Giving 8 only for spiderman nostalgia otherwise this would have been a 7 pointer.", "Absolutely 'Marvel'lous": "Thank you Marvel for bringing back my childhood.. this amazing movie brings a lot of happiness through the surprise that every 90's kid could never even imagine would happen one day! Extensive, Exquisite, Nostalgic, with a Emotional Ride, this movie had everything. Before this point, Tom Holland's Spiderman was overshadowed by Ironman and Marvel, but even though there are great actors in the film, he is never outshone by any of them. Throughout the film's highs and lows, Peter Parker wrestles with the question of what Spiderman represents and what \"with great power comes great responsibility\" means. Tom Holland is fantastic in the film, and his maturation throughout the franchise has been a joy to witness.

Please don't waste your money and time for this movie. For me, Badly written Storyline, Some overacting, and illogical plot were the main highlights. Many jokes and scenes were inserted just to cash the nostalgia without any need or place of them. The scenes should be organic. Whole scenes were created so that they can create a predictable punch line. It seems that movie's Storyline is written by a high school student who has given a task to write a term paper after watching a previous two spiderman series movies. I mean how these writers are getting paid is beyond my imagination.

On the other hand green Goblin was amazing, dr octopus is also fabulous. In a way this movie is the best spiderman movie in my list.

Then, facing the ramifications of that action, the villains, he decides to trap Dr Strange in his mirror realm and let them all out and have one big villain therapy shindig.The story is kind of... out of character?It seems that the entire movie is predicated on basically therapising or fixing these villains, rehabilitating them and doing good as Aunt May advised. Spider-Man has never treated his villains like this before - he's been merciful, but he does not cozy up to them like this, and it's severely naive and stupid given how trusting he was in the last movie of Mysterio.What is more however, is that the movie treats every villain like Goblin or Doc Oc, in that it is the unnatural and risky experiments they performed on themselves that are the problem. The people are \"fixed\" not rehabilitated. The personal issues and mentality that drove them to adopt these paths are still there. The remaining characters were not necessarily just made evil by experiment alone. This movie approaches the nature of evil and redemption in a very childish and inelegant way.Then there's the fact that these villains, returned Spider-Man(s), one-liner call-backs are essentially the main point of the movie. Though they may bring nostalgia to the surface, it is done so in an inorganic and sometimes forced way. Specifically, Aunt May's robbery of an iconic line just for a seemingly avoidable death and an unremarkable moment is awful. Norman's line is also forced, you can't help but feel that they hoped using these 'meme' lines would be enough to ignore how much of a catastrophe the actual plot is.That's about the gist of it. A nostalgia grab on every corner to patch up the many cracks and fractures in the writing, plot, and lets not forget, a ridiculously terrible ending with an awkward revisit to his old friends (not that they know that).", "I love you guys": "I sincerely hope that everyone involved in this beautiful project has a wonderful life and gets everything they deserve from life.

And when she dies, she dies happy knowing they had done the right thing, helping the Villains. This made me cry.2. Losing The Memory : when everyone knows that they need to forget about Peter. This was also teased in the beginning when Pete decided to seek help from Dr Strange. But when we see the emotional conflict between the trio, knowing no one will have any memory of Pete and the entire build up to the relationship will be shattered, we the viewer feel nothing but sad. This made me cry.3. The Coffee Shop : Peter goes to the coffee shop to tell his friends about him like he promised. But just as he gives MJ the piece of paper that explains everything, he sees her plaster. He thinks in this moment 'I'm the reason she has the wound' and stops. We the viewer understand the reasons for this action and the pain he feels after the relationship we've seen within the trio. This made me cry.I loved these 3 moments.1. The Confrontation With Goblin : we were all waiting for this since the moment May dies. The inner conflict with peter is really shown when Maguire stops him from impaling Norman. He struggles with Maguire because of the death of May but then he remembers why she died when he stops. She died because with 'great power comes great responsibility' he knows she would approve of him stopping.2. The interactions between Spider men : This is great. We see the emotions and fun the peters have. The interactions are fun and uplift the sadness in the movie.3. The references : this is great. The references to the older movies are there, great fan-service, but the references are used to the movies advantage. They are used as character development for the older peters. E.g. When MJ falls. Andrew jumps to save her, exactly like when Gwen falls. Unlike when Gwen falls, Andrew saves MJ. We see the happiness in his eyes in the tears he shed.I rated this movie 9/10 (no nostalgia) from people in the corridor at the end of the movie \"this is the best movie ever\" was all I could hear. Even from my own friends who've never seen the prior movies to have any nostalgia from the fan service.", "Praise the Trinity": "Marvel has proven that it is the master of movie making again and again.

The argument is plain dumb, a bad screenplay with mediocre dialogues. The acting is average and just \"ok\" from all characters except, of course, from William Dafoe. The music score is just there, it doesn't generate shivers, they kind of tried to play \"epic music\" to create a WOW moment, but failed epicly trying. The first 20 minutes drag on like a \"teenage drama\", reminiscent of a John Hughes movie. Just another Marvel movie trying to bring back the good old days, heavily focused on quantity (Allies and foes) rather than quality. The blind guy's 3 minute performance, was better than the whole 2 hours movie.", "Meaning": "Regardless of the amazing fan service what really makes Spider-Man: No Way Home stand out is the meaning behind it. In basically every super hero movie the hero saves the city or the universe etc etc.. but in this movie Peter risks everything to save people trying to hurt him, bad people, why? Because he believes in them. This shows us what a real hero is.

However, let's not pretend it didn't have anything to do with Nostalgia.I did like how they took some risks with some of the twists and turns which made the movie feel less predictable. It's got a good mix of comedy and seriousness as well!The ranking this movie currently has on IMDB as the 9th best all-time rated movie is laughable though.", "Amzing movie": "Really good writing could have showed is bit more and had a lot of lazy writing.

I wish they didn't gave us the plot in the trailer like in the Endgame, then this movie could caused earthquakes in theatres LOL.This movie is not only the best Spider-Man, but the best Peter Parker filim. This movie explores his problems, responsibilities, burdens, relationships, his mindset etc. So this movie is very emotional and very heart touching. The ending was pure heart melting and it got us exited for this franchise's future.This movie has an amazing story and so many nostalgic moments that will make you say aww, if you are a big fan of the comics and other spidey movies.It has a lot of chills, laughs and cries.You will rewatch this movie again and again.", "10/10 Acting and Writing": "Just goes to show that good writing always pays off.

The plot is weak in many instances, and the story doesn't seem to add on. I was expecting much more, and certain scenes look lame and predictable. Compared to other Spider-Man movies, this one lacks interest, and bringing in previous casts doesn't seem to be action-packed. The story seemed slow-paced at times, and Peter Parker who's having all the senses as Spider-Man trusting a villain seems too lame and kills the interest in the storyline, and the Spider-Man from a different universe (Tobey) getting stabbed by Goblin while trying to save him? Really? Have they lost all their Spider senses due to aging? Marvel would've done a better job with this movie, and I hope they will not disappoint their fans in their upcoming releases.

Honestly I've never had so much fun and I've never heard an audience this loud ever, BUT that doesn't doesn't mean the movie doesn't have any flaws because it does. For example Lizard and Sandman were big disappointments, CGI was a bit messy in places, pacing was a bit weird sometimes especially in the first act of the movie, there was also a few plot holes but I think they can be explained. Overall tho I adored this movie and I really couldn't have asked for much more.", "Best movie ever!": "OMG! The best movie of 2021 and best Spiderman movie!

It has to be at least the Spider Man film that puts Peter Parker in a bigger responsibility rather than just being the web-slinger.From all the past incarnations of Spider-Man, we've seen them encounter personal journeys/challenges that we never get to see in the MCU Spider-Man. While Tom managed to be doing well as both young Peter Parker and an impressive Spider Man, the films in his (first...perhaps) trilogy never really see any increase in terms of his potential as Spider-Man alone. It was all coated with Stark Technology to show how he can be an incredibly intelligent kid with a Stark Industry internship. While indeed it helped him become the best of himself and Spider-Man, it doesn't really see him do much progress if you remove all of them behind. Maybe, it is just too soon to say.But, maybe this film can slightly prove it wrong. Maybe this is just a tip of the iceberg on what Tom's Peter and Spidey can do.A lot of things can be unpacked from this film. From the personal confrontations to the nostalgic menacing return of the villains, then to the major conflicts, it really shifted MCU Peter's perception of himself as Spider-Man. But what is really a changed Spider-Man without the help of...other Spider-Men? At this moment, it is what every Spider-Man fan could have ever wanted and I think this film really did it well.Not the best Spider-Man film yet, but the greatest for Tom!", "You go to a pawn shop and....": "You go to a pawn shop and tell em I'm looking for Back to the Future and the guy at the counter says best I can do is MIB.

Spider-Man: No Way Home is an impressive culmination of the films that came before it, with an engaging storyline, exciting action, laugh out loud moments, and dramatic consequences. The beginning climb is a little slow, but it's an exhilarating ride once things get swinging. I don't exactly know how this movie will hold up after multiple viewings, as there are some plot points that don't quite make sense when you start to think about them, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself this first time.", "'There is no way home' is an example of how a fan service for fans should be designed.": "'There is no way home' is an example of how a fan service for fans should be designed. All the villains are perfectly matched, the stupid Goblin mask is removed and he has acquired a more spectacular look. The story of Aunt May and Uncle Ben is done wisely, and here you really get into death. Does the doctor spoil all the raspberries with his cleaning abilities? No, because we don't know their limits, and we have to take his word for it. The curse of the movie spider was gracefully bypassed when 5 villains were dragged into the film, but in the end the fights came out 1 on 1. How so? Watch the movie. Even the idea of a multiverse, which usually serves as an excuse for any heresy, is appropriate and very necessary here. I hope that Disney will continue to make films with the good neighbor spider and will leave behind the corpse of the avengers. Let it be better to resuscitate people-a cross. Strictly watch, if you have time - in the cinema. The film is beautiful. PS. Pure taste, but if they could somehow pull Emma Stone up sideways, the film would be great.

If we talk about graphics, special effects and animation, then they all turned out to be at an excellent level, and given that the film was shot during COVID - 19, the creators of this film did their best. The plot is incredible! I think the fact that the old actors who starred in past films played a role here. Their return was a big surprise for everyone, everyone was pleased to see them again on the screen. Speaking of acting, everyone did their best, the roles were played just fine. In general, to summarize, I advise everyone to watch this film, but I want to get acquainted with the previous parts, so that there would be an understanding of what is happening. Happy viewing.", "Best movie of all time no spoiler only facts": "This movie was the best of all time and really really emotional, I cried soo many times even till today I get really emotional when I remember this movie.

I agree, it is simple, with blunders, but there is a plot - this is already cool. Events are just too many. The film has intrigue. . And even if we can predict the course of events, it's still easy to watch, because with interesting characters. Secondly, humor. The film turned out to be really funny - who would have thought! Madly liked the grandmother of Peter Parker's best friend and, of course, Doctor Strange with his sarcasm. The film is really bright.This is a unique spectacle that cannot even be called a movie. This is more than a movie. This is a meeting. Meeting old friends on the other side of the screen. Marvel, on this day, gave us the biggest gift they could.I am glad that I watched this film, because I got a lot of emotions and a wonderful impression. I advise you to look at those who are interested in this hero, who want to remember the already forgotten characters. PS. Don't run away after the first scene if you love Marvel movies.", "Fanservice": "The standard of fanservice in cinema\nI went to the cinema a couple of months ago to see the film. I was not going to write a review, but I saw an inadequate rating and 80th place in the TOP 250 and could not stand it. What is he doing there? It's just a fan service product, like all the latest Star Wars.So, I am perfectly familiar with the history of Spider-Man. I watched all the films in the 21st century, played many games, read some comics as a child, and of course, watched the animated series 94, both as a child and at a conscious age. But no, I'm not a 'offended Spider-Man fan'. I just looked and that's it. I don't understand how an adult can be a fan of superheroes.A film for children. When I watched the movie, I got the impression that I was watching 'Power Rangers' or any other children's series from the 90s. What is happening on the screen is a farce and a comedy, and the obvious ones. Maximum designed for children. Not even teenagers, but just children under 12 years old. I don't know what else to add. If you do not see this, then you are a child. This film is a far cry from even Infinity War or Captain America: Civil War, both in terms of intensity and drama, as well as philosophical themes it raises.Bad start to drama. And all the more strange after all the nonsense that happened in the first part of the film, to see the drama and tragic events. You don't get into them, the film initially sets a different mood, it was just funny to me personally. The events themselves are also as ridiculous as possible, supposedly the consequences of a moral choice, morality, morality, morality ... Or can we just have an interesting story? It's not interesting to look at all this, the meaning of the events is not in history, but in instilling morality in the viewer, and it's already utterly beaten.Fanservice. This film is the epitome of fanservice in cinema. And I still resented the new Star Wars. Just the maximum, it can't get any worse. To please everyone, to make a bunch of references, to connect with other films. Yes, the idea is good, but the embodiment of this idea is at the level of children's TV shows from the 00s. Most of the last scenes are goofy dialogue that pulls out of itself comedy. Many are very long and filmed in the pavilion, reminiscent of a sitcom. Somewhere I've seen it all before. It looks like an invitation to stars in a popular series.Peter Parker and his friends. A question that has been dragging on for 3 films and haunting me. 'Why are Parker's friends so ridiculous?' What about the Flash? In what place, in what universe, did he suddenly become cool? Why this particular actor? There are no questions for Mary Jane, she suits her character. Peter Parker himself has not developed in any way for 3 films, although it seems that he participated in the 'Civil War' and fought with Thanos and did everything. But no, he's still the same schoolboy. Well, it can't be, it can't be.The technical part of the film. Yes, the film is designed in the general design of the Marvel universe, but it is shot cheaply, the scenery is plastic, the action scenes are not impressive. The computer graphics are visible to the naked eye. I guess I'm just tired of all this. Well, the script... I can directly imagine how it was written by a group of enthusiasts who offered their 'brilliant ideas' precisely on the principle of 'touching the viewer' and doing something 'original'.Eventually. The film is aimed at children and 'fans of superheroes'. He is boring and uninteresting. However, he really is the epitome of fanservice. In terms of fan service for the film, you can already write training manuals. It has its advantages and interesting solutions, but they are not enough to pull out a story about nothing, written specifically for the most successful implementation of fan service and collecting the maximum amount of money.", "About film": "My favorite movie is fairy tale. I really believe that Peter will grow up faster and become even more cool than his colleagues from parallel universes.", "Good film, awesome characters": "One aspect of the genius of Stan Lee, who invented not only Spider-Man, but also many of his most famous rivals, was the ability to create humane and sympathetic villains. Almost every enemy of Spider-Man was originally a good person, but then succumbed to emotions, became a victim of his own pride or a tragic combination of circumstances. That is why many of these characters can easily be transformed into antiheroes. The movie \"Spider-Man: There is No Way Home\" is dedicated specifically to the theme of redemption of villains who received a second chance thanks to Strange's witchcraft. Characters previously harmed at the hands of Spider-Man can now be saved by Peter Parker. Those who have watched movies with Tobey Maguire remember that Norman Osborn is mentally ill and needs help, and Otto Octavius has problems controlling his cybernetic tentacles - these poor fellows need to be treated, not killed! It's not for nothing that the phrase goes through all the Peter Parker movie comics that with great power comes great responsibility.The appearances of the villains that the previous incarnations of Spider-Man fought against are not brief cameos designed to cause nostalgia among fans. Their stories are very important, their choices determine the basis of the plot - someone will step on the path of correction, someone will not want to change, and someone will remain scared, embittered and not really understanding anything. By helping others, Peter Parker will grow as a person. At the beginning of the film, Stephen Strange notes with regret that Peter, despite all his superhero exploits, has remained an unintelligent schoolboy who commits rash acts. In the finale, a completely different Parker appears before us - matured, learned to make difficult decisions and ready for a new trilogy (which has already been announced by Sony representatives).Strange also accuses Parker of trying to sit on two chairs at once (and this sounds extremely ironic if you remember that Spider-Man is currently in joint use with Sony and Disney).The movie comic \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is able to reconcile fans of Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland and give everyone who loves heartfelt, sentimental and at the same time spectacular superhero stories two and a half hours of pure pleasure.", "Opinion of an ordinary person": "In fact, I was really looking forward to the release of this film, because almost every guy my age literally grew up on films and cartoons about Spider-Man. And you know, this film did not disappoint me, a good plot, amazing actors and incredible developments, watching this film you can laugh and cry. (Spoiler alert!) And the return of Toby and Andrew has become a legendary event not only in the history of Spider-Man, but in the entire Marvel universe, people who worked on the film have great respect, Stan Lee can be proud of you! To everyone who read my opinion on this film, I can say one thing, you definitely will not be disappointed in it.", "Homem aranha": "Eu simplesmente amo esse filme, tem seus erros bobos tem, mas pra mim o filme \u00e9 incr\u00edvel, a atua\u00e7\u00e3o do Tom Holland \u00e9 incr\u00edvel, a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do Peter do Tom Holland \u00e9 maravilhosa, intera\u00e7\u00e3o do Peters \u00e9 muito boa, e n\u00e3o tem como falar da atua\u00e7\u00e3o do Willem Dafoe que \u00e9 simplesmente maravilhosa.", "Whats New?": "Everyone who loves Spider-Man is always happy with new products. But do they all justify themselves and did the new film need to be based on past events?The previous movie ended with everyone knowing about the true owner of the Spider-Man costume. Did it have a good effect on Peter Parker? I don't think so, because he began to be pushed from all sides, such a revelation greatly influenced the hero's friends and aunt.. Because of this, Peter dropped his hands and went for help. Then, because of a mistake, everything went downhill and events took on the scale of multi Universes and other spider-men.The plot is fascinating, and the appearance of heroes from other time intervals and Universes pleased the eye. As a discussion on the topic that everything in general was in the time of the Spider, it is very interesting and exciting. Unexpected dramas, the characters of other spiders were revealed even better. Their inner experiences, which open up after so much time, were affected.Of course, it is confusing that a lot of things are repeated, so ilm becomes boring to watch, almost the entire film is expected and very predictable.I'm glad I watched this movie because I got a lot of emotions and had a great impression. I advise you to look at those who are interested in this hero and who want to remember with trepidation already forgotten characters.", "My comm": "So many expectations, so many hopes and merged photos. For any fan, the new part of \"Spider-Man\" is always the main release of the year. So far, films with Holland's participation have not disappointed, but they have not jumped to the bar set by Sam Raimi. Did Watts manage to create something more, or is there really nothing except references in the film?The continuation of the Spider-Man saga captures us at the moment when \"Far from Home\" ends, at the moment of the opening of Spider-Man's identity. A friendly neighbor is caught up in a storm from all sides: the authorities accuse Mysterio of murder, and society turns into a crowd of paparazzi and does not let Peter breathe even at school. In an attempt to stop this madness, the spider turns to Doctor Strange, but the oblivion spell does not work correctly and instead of everyone forgetting about Parker's duality, portals to the multiverse open from where our old acquaintances come.The main thing you need to know about the end of the new trilogy is a movie made by fans for fans. The creators even make up memes that they came up with based on old paintings about a spider. Such a balanced balance of humor and drama, as in this part, it is difficult to remember anywhere else.A huge number of characters in this part works both in plus and minus. On the one hand, it gives the viewer a lot of emotions from meeting old acquaintances (in some cases, the hall turned into a mini stadium meeting a favorite performer) and an excellent opportunity for a metashoot, on the other hand, it decently overloads the plot. John Watts tried to balance the film by introducing the characters gradually, thereby increasing the timing of the picture, and in fact he managed not to slide into mincemeat of constantly changing faces and jokes. The middle of the film, however, slightly loses momentum. There are a lot of climactic moments in the film when you have already cried all your rivers, and you need to cry another scene again.Do not think that the film is bad, this is fundamentally wrong. The middle, which has sunk in dynamics, is the only negative that can be detected at a glance. \"Spider-Man: There is no Way Home\" reveals all the signs of a great blockbuster, which has cool music (even classic themes from old parts), and great action scenes, and most importantly, it has a soul. A film in which the world can collapse at any second, and Peter goes crazy before our eyes, brings kindness and human relations to the fore. So, a little schizophrenic episodes with doppelgangers give Holland's character a development that he seemed to have missed being in the Avengers. He became a hero, but he didn't learn how to be Spider-Man. Now Watts has corrected this misunderstanding and has done it in a truly brilliant style.", "Wow!!!!": "After watching The Matrix, I needed positive emotions to come to my senses a little, and the film by John Watts not only gave me a lot of emotions, it gave me a lot of things and, first of all, a chic mood.Already from the first frame, you want to get high and enjoy the movie, because it is made very cool and of high quality. It was the case that you enjoy even small details, the music pleases you, the acting also, the plot and the script itself. You feel that this movie is definitely yours and you want to be in it for as long as possible. Of course there are cons, but you don't pay much attention to them, you are just happy with what is happening on the big screen.Burunov correctly said: \"Marvel knows how to surprise.\" Yes, they were pleasantly surprised. This Spider is very dramatic and the young actors are very good, I was surprised that they can really act like that. If I expected this from Tom Holland, then Zendaya pleasantly surprised me.It seems to me that this film is absolutely for all ages, from children to adults, many will find something of their own.In the picture, the level of nostalgia just rolls over, to collect so many characters in one film, if someone told me that it was possible, I think I would not have believed it before, but this is a real reality, seeing them all together is a real balm for the soul.Of course, I was looking forward to the appearance of the three Spiders, although I confess at the very beginning, as soon as the news about this went, it seemed to me that these were rumors, but they were not rumors. Also, I could not have imagined that so many villains would be in one film. It's not just the Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus I've been waiting for, but also Electro, Doctor Connors, even the Sandman. You can shoot two films with such a composition.The effects are amazing, the plot is chic, Toby's appearance is a real hysteria in the pleasant sense of the word, it's hard to restrain yourself when you see Toby in the image of Spider-Man, but he has changed, but much has been preserved from him and, of course, Evgeny Ivanov's native voice is like back to childhood. With all due respect to the others, Toby's appearance is the best thing I've seen this year.But I didn't see Willem Dafoe in the image of the Green Goblin even more than Toby. The dubbing of Valery Kukhareshin, as before, is inimitable. Just to tears.Of course, I will say emotionally and subjectively, but for me this is a movie, how to shoot for your fans. Variety from the smallest to the largest.I repeat, but I want to emphasize again that the plot, characters, humor, motivation, actions, action scenes, everything was incredible and beautiful.The film after which you go out with a completely unreal mood and mentally thank everyone who took part in this film.The scene after the credits adds to the already positive emotions.Thank you for a great movie at the end of 2021. It was worth it!!!", "Super Awesome!": "What I wanted to see in this movie, it delivered perfectly. I am truly excited for what comes next.I wasn't expecting something quite as amazing as this, this was two and a half hours of incredible entertainment, drama, action, there truly was something for everyone here.", "Goos": "There is so much to unpack here. And I understand that some people may not be into the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but it is apparent how much almost everyone loves this movie. And as you can tell I am one of them. Now you could dismiss my opinion, since I have clearly bought and swallowed the MCU pill (I openly admit liking and being a fan boy of what has been created there - you can hate me or simply agree with me, all opinions are welcome) ... but I dare anyone who has seen all Spider Man movies, not to feel at least something rather positive about this.It does take many good things from previous efforts (no pun intended) and gets the best out of them. It does a great service to the (movie) history of Spider-Man. But also showing us a different side of a Marvel hero ... a side that is vulnerable in a way we have not seen yet. Or not in that form - the identity crisis and the good deeds that do not go unpunished ... or do they? Tom Holland has been exposed - something you know if you've seen the previous Spider-Man movie ... and while his mentor Iron Man dealt differently with that fame - recognition, Peter Parker as we know him, can not deal with it the same way.Add to that, that he wants to help people as much as he can (a bit of a difference to what Tony Stark stood for most of the time, being self centered and and self serving) - and you have a dangerous combination. There is a reason the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies are being compared with 80s teen comedies - there are many parallels (John Hughes and others are being name dropped in those conversations). And while there is a lot of action (the mirror world scene has so many \"climactic\" scenes I probably did not close my mouth the entire time it was happening), the movie also takes its time to give us little character moments.And a lot of fan service - this movie celebrates what came before. It celebrates and takes its audience seriously. But in a fun and entertaining way. Yes it is not all fun and games and there are a lot of callbacks (no pun intended) - there is drama, there may be even some head shaking at how naive Peter Parker seems ... but it makes sense in the realm of the world that was built around him and the character that he is - there is an evolution, but he can't help himself - being who he is and who he grew up to be. For better or worse ... yes the famous line will be uttered and it will have a sad undertone to it. But the movie is able to give you so much, that even when you know something completely horrible is about to happen, you also know that some lighter moments will follow.That being said, it takes nothing away from the performance by Tom Holland, who has to play vulnerable, playful, ecstatic, experimental, shy and giving/helpful ... while a lot has been made of who is going to be in the movie (or not) - it is his movie. Yes there are many things that you can tear apart and make fun of - there are logic issues if you want to call them that ... but in a world where \"magic\" exists ... are you really going to nitpick? Maybe you will, which would be a shame - because you'll be missing out on one hell of a movie and a ride that is truly amazing - no pun intended.It is also amazing that Sony and Disney reached a deal - so that Marvel can continue to use Spiderman in their universe. But not just him ... it seems there is way more to come. And while having many throwbacks (and callbacks) and bringing them all to a conclusion of sorts ... well while all that could mean that this could be a nice way to end Tom Hollands reign as Spider-Man ... it could just as easily continue. The possibilities are endless going forward.As you can tell I am not one to spoil or say anything that is revealing. That is why I did not talk about the cast and the cameos - most of them were revealed ahead of time. Either officially (villains) or just through rumors (no matter how much denying went on - we knew ... we just knew) ... but there was a cameo that most did not see coming - pun very much intended.If you watched this in a cinema (which I can only highly recommend to do), you will probably still have goosebumps. You either cheered yourself loudly at quite a few moments (or gasped at others) ... or just enjoyed silently ... what a movie experience that was. One that I might repeat in cinemas - a treat I do not give myself too often, because I tend to let a bit of time pass before I rewatch something after the first time viewing ... but there are exceptions and this might very well be one of them ... Spider-Man you Sir ... are one of the good ones! Pun again intended - because you too are amazing.", "A Great time to be a Spider-Man fan.": "Spider-Man No Way Home is a good movie with some flaws here and there. A problem with the movies is that the first half drags on for a little too long and can feel boring. The CGI can look off sometimes but its not too bad. The second half is great with the old characters from previous Spider-Man movies returning. The plot has some holes but the good out weighs the bad. The movie is also really funny and the characters talking feels natural. The acting is also really good especially from Willem Dafoe and Andrew Garfield. It deserves all the hype and is one of the greatest MCU movie. If you are a Spider-Man fan it is a must watch..", "Bad preaching story line": "I'm mainly there to watch Dr Strange but still disappointed by the preaching plot line of this movie (similar to several other Marvel superhero movies). Way worse than Spider-verse with similar concepts. You DON'T try to save several super villains because who knows how many thousands or millions of other people they could have killed in the process!Total disappointment. I don't want to rate it this low but want to bring the hype down. This movie is not worth its current IMDB score of 9/10 AT ALL.", "Member berries": "The movie didn't add any further to the plot, if anything sent it backwards. However like many others I'm a sucker for cameos. Willem Defoe saves this movie.", "The worst spiderman ever": "I'm very surprised how people can be so excited with so little. Some reviews are clearly fake.This is by far the worst spiderman ever. Boring storyline, action basically only the last 10 minutes of the movie. A lot of novel fact talk which impacts negatively the development of the story.Very childish and annoying spiderman acting that got into my nerves.The best spiderman is by far Andrew Garfield with \"The Amazing Spideman\", the rest is for 5 years kids.The rate of this movie is ridiculous and doesn't reflect the reality.This spiderman and the horrible Eternals are the worst MCU movie ever.", "Broke my heart": "I really don't like the MCU,this series are not my cup of tea(and i left watching after Guardians of the Galaxy Eps-I),but still i just wanted to believe that this movie is going to really better than others,this is going to give the spider-men we loved(not only the guys who bring that wall-crawler life). And I'm not talking about visual effects or fights;MCU really does this all well but this elements are not only thing/s that make a movie into art. The music/acting/feeling and also atmosphere is way more important than them. And again I couldn't find it enough in this movie,Scenerio was simple and you could've guess what is going to happen after 10 minutes,charachters are not reliable(and for someone like me who didn't like homecoming/ffh) I couldn't even shad a single tear to their \"emotional scenes\". So about those \"jokes\" from high school...I don't even want to talk about it,It's fricking childish. Of course, I'm not expecting to DeadPool-like adult jokes but I really want to ask you is this really funny? I mean,reaaally??About villains I'm glad that they bring us the Well-created villains from their universes. Or,should I be? For example what Lizard adds to this story? Or my biggest hardbroke old \"spider-men\".... They just put those guys together so older spidermen fans will go to the Movie,just like me. But If you ask me is it worth,i would definitely say no. Except Green Goblin. Anyways if it wasn't the end of the \"Homecoming Trilogy\" I would've give 7. It finally taught what life is like to Tom Holland's spider-man. But if we agree the all movies are not binded for MCU Spider-man had a succes of solo it's 7/10 from my point of view. I wish they hired Marc Webb or Sam Raimi-like director and a good composer for the this serie. They'd treat it better.", "Review for Spiderman-No way home": "This review involves spoilers, and the spoilers will effect your movie experience, if you don't want to be spoiled, please scroll away.7 point in total. (2 points for the special effects, 2 points for the spidermans in the same universe, 2 points for the good o memories, 0 points for the story, it's like feeding u vomit)Okay, I've watched all the visions of the spiderman movies, and I was pretty excited. The pace of the movie was pretty quick, and that's one of the differences between Marvel and Sony.I believe May's death is totally because of Parker(third generation, the avenger one), just like how Uncle Ben died in the other 2 generations of the spidermam movies. But May's death can be avoided if Spiderman 1 had a better understanding to the overall situation. What he did in this movie was like how he gave the glasses to Mysterio in Far From Home.The mistake Spiderman 1(avenger) was totally different from the other 2 generations because the other 2 generations made their mistakes when they first got their power, and I understand that. But Spiderman 1(avenger) have already had his power for so long, and experienced through so many stuff, Tony died, he have fought Thanos. To me, it doesn't make sense of the choices he have made in this movie, or it might be just the way I think.Overall, the movie was okay. I was happy to see 3 generations of spidermans on the screen together. The special effects was never disappointing, the fighting scenes are excellent.I was disappointed because I kinda had higher expectations.", "My expectations for this film were off the chart due to what I had heard and read about how great it is": "My expectations for this film were off the chart due to what I had heard and read about how great it is. What it does deliver is plenty of spectacle. But a great film needs more than that. The story also moves along with some pace. But emotional impact should never be sacrificed for expediency.

What makes the new spiderman's so great is that they are grounded and they serve the audience's expectations...nothing too crazy nothing to \"woke\" nothing to out of the ordinary for the sake of being on brand for this generation.

Story line doesn't makes any sense and it gets worse by the time. The movie have some funny family moments but soon it gets dramatic and the grief is overwhelming.Many things doesn't makes any sense. You can say its a total senseless movie.Spoiler:In the end of the plot Dr. Strange casts spell so everyone forgets the identity of the Spiderman. The writer gets carried away in his mind and totally forget about the spell that it was for people to forget the identity of the Spiderman instead they all forgot about Peter Parker, which is too much lame. M. J. And his best friend also forgot about who is Peter Parker. They were class fellows.For a blockbuster movie they should have picked a wise writer who doesn't get carried away from the story on hand.", "Awesome, but the events of the movie!!!!!!": "I loved the appearance of all the previous monsters and the 3 Spider-Man and of course Andrew's rescue of Mary Jane, but the speed and occurrence of events were not realistic.", "Holy s**t what a movie!!!!!": "I've honestly never seen a movie have so many call backs to past movies and stories which have such a dear place in our hearts my god it did so well with it too!I've just come out the screening and never before felt so many emotions and being from the uk I've never seen a cinema make such noise before That's how good it was.Seeing toby and Andrew alone made for a great movie but the perfect mix of emotion and humour between them make it only better and the ending being both expected but also coming so out of the blue was perfect and I can't wait to see where they go now with Spider-Man.", "Too much fan service": "This is not a good entry in the MCU. I think is too soon to realize that, but if we consider the other films is this one really that good? Better than endgame, as some people have said? Think about it for a second.The plot suffers from too much pandering and humor, leaving the story as empty. I never cared about this aunt May, she was made as 80% of the scenes in other films as comic relief. Unlce Ben worked because he was a monothematic aspect of SpiderMan persona: responsability. And the fact that Norman is made the main antagonist in a flash, is defeated in one scene and all antagonists can just be \"cured\" reduces the overall weight of the plot. Yes, I know who these characters are but nothing new is added, so I just dont care. The epitome of this is \"killing\" Tobby and seconds later he just left.Besides the presentation of \"oh look, its Tobby! Oh look its Molina!\" everything else is just shallow. And a few years from now people will realize the MCU has better films, by far.", "Wow the ...no spoiler": "THE FILM IS INSANE AND GREAT AND GIVE IT 100 OUT 10 BEC OF THE GREAT CGI AND AND SPIDERMAN ARE GREAT AND DOCTOR STRANGE IS VERYYY GOOD.

Highly recommend.", "it's O-k for the regular, non-fan, audience": "The first 90min (which could be a stand alone movie ten years ago) are static, no flow. A very slow build up. Yes, it's a fun movie, but it's not an interesting movie. The main trio is cool to watch but we have seen that all ready in SpiderVerse, so it's not that special. It's cute... not hot.", "Mind Blowing": "This is the best movie I've seen this year.I never thought something mind blowing like this will happen. I'm feeling really pumped right now and I wanna talk about it but I can't spoil it.I really love the MCU.", "Way too overrated!": "I'm realy amazed how such a movie could be classified as an Action. It contained way too many dramatic scenes. Which were badly introduced to the audiance and kind of fake. I was about to sleep 5 times due to these overslowed scenes which don't fit to such a movie. Obviously the director wanted to do something more valuable compared to the last Marvel movies, but he totally went to the wrong end as he mixed fast paced action scenes with overslowed drama scenes all the time with the level of directing not so good.Ofcourse the movie came with some plotgaps. It also touched the frequently mentioned multiverse theory which concept is usualy hard to be explained properly. Actualy to me this was the topic that could have turned my overall feeling about the movie. Unfortunately the director lead us to some strange and unrealistic scenes and hurt my feelings about the movie even more.I give 5 starts just for the actors, sound effects, visual effects and that's it.I take 5 stars for the plotgaps, genre mismatches, improperly mixed scene pace over the whole movie and overall feeling after watching it.Hope better movies to come!", "TRULY AMAZING!": "A MUST WATCH FOR ALL MCU AND SPIDER-MAN FANS!!! I've been going cinemas for as long as I can remember and it's the first time hearing people cheer in a UK cinema.

Its was just awesome from start to finish!! Marvel and spidey fans get ready, you will not be disappointed!!", "Best Spider Man movie ever it is the Ultimate Spectuclar Amazing Spider Man.": "Since this is Sony Marvel project, I was worried, because they revealed too much in Trailers. In Addition, Marvel did mediocre/hollywood job in their post Endgame phase.However, this ladies and gentlemen is non of that. This movie does really spectacular job. The development throughout the movie is just amazing. All characters did developed very well, the pace was the most perfect part aside from the Spoilers stuff. Dr Strange felt really needed and fitted into this one more than Iron Man in Tom first movie. Co-stars were just ultimately bros and pros. The Villians and their philosophy were really deep and well introduced and clearer than ever. Peter Parker this time felt like Andrew's and Tobey's. Balanced, flawed and have real struggles aside being \"just kid with Tony Stark left overs solutions\".For what it is SP: No Way Home, just did great job the fan service on trailers speaks for itself. They nailed every part and easters eggs were just magnificent. Peter and Spidey are well balanced than ever, the antagonist had real purpose and finally we get rid of Iron Man \"Is the reason of their suffer\". The sound effects were flawless. Visuals almost there, but couple of weird CGIs minor flaws, I mean similar to that Tony Stark moving head while being in the suit, but nothing too serious. If you think trailers were too much, will they are nothing and count as pooring compare to the movie.NWH as super hero movie it is just up there in the list with Dark Knight, First Iron Man and Spider Man 2. It did better job than most of Marvel Movies.Best movie in 2021 period.", "A lot of Marvel in one package": "No Way Home is about the existential need to understand ourselves. It's about the understanding our own identity & problems we face when we the world forces us to reshape our understanding of it.What's always worked spider man (beyond the boyish good looks of Andrew Garfiend or the mesmerizing smile of Toby Maguire) versus other super hero stories is that Spider Man appeals to our sense of nostalgia for our youth, you root for him because we can relate what it's like to see things through the lense of inexperience. The world is still pretty big for a young man who has seen the things that he has seen and is still able to retain an optimism for life.On the surface this movie is the best of the Sony versions, a great lead in to the rest of the Multiverse (I almost wrote Meta). Give it a little more credit for being a movie this is also about what it's like to see yourself looking back at yourself.What I liked:\nI like the return of the the best of Spiderman's villains, it was nice to see Alfred Molina.There were some believable banter between the spider men. They were lightly handled by Tom Holland & Andrew Garfield with some surprisingly touching moments by Toby Maguire.The return of Dr. Strange!I liked that we see a vulnerable Spidey who believably matures before our eyes.I liked that there weren't any glaring plot holes or performance gaffs.What I didn't like, movie nitpicks.I don't think any of these things are reason enough to lower my overall feel or score of the movie.Why was Strange so easily swayed?Marisa Tomei was the weakest character (not her performance per say), is she a good Aunt May?His actual plan seems silly, but he is a teenager.Why was the fabricator not being used? Props to Happy for keeping Parkers hands off it.What's this obsession to save these criminals? Seems like a good idea for two seconds, Although; it does highlight his maturation, as he grapples with\nthe feelings of failure and cynicism when realizes he's reaching for too much. There's a touching scene at the end of all the chaos that scene makes you forget how loosely all this part of the story was constructed.Over all it's a great Marvel film that after a little time will probably be up there with some of the others like Civil War or Guardians of the Galaxy.", "Plot and Story all over the place": "Went to see the film last night, I am a huge fan of Spider-Man. I'm also a film maker and have worked in film and TV production.This one of No Way Home was entertaining but was not to the original comics and for me lost its original story of Spider-Man.Not impressed, the plot was all over the place along with the pace. It felt like Marvel and Sony are running out of ideas.Yes it's great to get the hype that this film brings but the content of the plot is missing. The message that it tries to deliver gets lost.I'm starting to pull away from any new Marvel film that comes out now as I believe the plots all ended in End game.My message to the producers, let it go now before the original story of them all is ruined, and the franchise goes with it.", "10 minutes left of the movie, still wasnt hooked": "Pretty bad lines, bad characters, bad acting.The story did not hook me at all, I could have left right before the ending, didn't care how it ended.The lines seemed written for teenagers, simple, repetitive jokes.Also the fact that Dr. Strange asked Peter to catch all the bad guys in the cells before sending them back did not make any sense. Why not just make the magic box and send them back anyway?", "Never thought we would ever use plural form of 'Spider-Man'": "What a damn kickass movie it has been... I wept at the demise of Iron man in Avengers - Endgame and was very dismayed that there wouldn't be anything great than 'End game' to look forward from Marvel... However this one just restores the faith in Marvel again.... Wow... WOW WOW... What an entertaining flick this is.Coming to the movie, I warn you guys that for the first time my review has got spoilers as I can't contain my excitement after such surreal experience... Read it on your own riskAs the movie begins, first five minutes into it the background score makes you groove your body to the music & just hypnotizes into the spidey world, felt great....And then the bridge sequence thrills you and makes you feel good about being crazy of MARVEL movies, it's a great fight sequence.... The Duel between Dr. Strange and Avenger Spider-Man is whole lot of a different ball together that I have no words to express... The mirror dimensional sequence and the math that Spidey brings into it is such a great idea that it's a proof why we really adore & are obsessed about Marvel movies.And not to miss that the crowd went crazy on Doc Octopus entry, ppl were actually screaming like hell on an entry of a villian (that's how well the people are connected to yester year Spiderman-2 that they remember the antagonist too)...The scream grew much louder on the entry of Green Goblet (villian from SM-1)at this moment I wished Tobey should show up as Spiderman based on logic that if villian returned due to spell of Dr. Strange how the hero could be left from returning.And then Andrew Garfield shows up as Spiderman, the crowd echoed in cheerful screaming, and at this moment I was nervous that will Tobey show up or not citing his age, did he agree to work in this one or not and while I was busy in these thoughts - the most humble, loving neighborhood guy shows up on the screen as Peter Parker and that's when the whole hall ROARED in celebration, literally everyone shouted their lungs out in jubilation.... I thought it was only me who was wishing to see Tobey to come on screen but to my surprise everyone who loves spidey was also dying for the same magic even if it were to be just a comeoAnd just when all the three Spider-Mans team up... the excitement, fun and adreline rush gets tripled\n(Never in my wildest thoughts I imagined there would be a time or need to use plural for Spiderman \ud83d\ude1d\ud83d\ude1d)The moment all the three Spider-Mans fling into sky, the theater reverberated into thunderous euphoric mood \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udd7a\ud83d\udd7a\ud83d\udd7aEven before Iron man came into existence in 2008, I was spidey fan despite of having Superman owing to my fondness for Tobey Maguire and this movie today is very special to reliving my memories as teenager from 2002 who was awestruck by the Spiderman movie back then.Well to conclude, this one is a hell of a roller coaster ride that one should definitely board to feel some great experience of entertainment, you won't regret this ride for sure .... And to tell you more about it... everyone was so enjoying and celebrating this movie that, a dialouge from first movie in 2002 came up and crowd echoed chanting it \"With great Power, comes Great responsibility\", that's how Marvel had its spell on audience... Just incredible \ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Unexpected surprise": "I saw the movie \ud83c\udfa5 yesterday and it was amazing\nMusic, effects, and story.

Overall best marvel film.", "On Par With Endgame - Fabulous!": "Without spoiling anything, this movie is an absolute rollercoaster. A bit dry at the beginning, but it gets good quickly and unexpectedly. There's moments of comedy, action & sad moments. Compared to other Marvel movies though, this was definitely on the rougher and more violent side (especially when compared to previous Spider-Man movies. Emotionally & just in general, this 100% on par with Endgame.

The chemistry between all of the actors was superb, and i've never been in a cinema where there has been 3+ round of applause during the film until now.", "Pefrect TImeline": "Not as a marvel fan, but as a spider man fan, I really think combining timelines of 20 years of spider man franchise paid well and it is really a bold move...it worked....

I loved every second of it. Went from can't stop smiling to crying like a baby a number of times and that doesnt happen.", "Amazing action-packed Spiderman": "This is by far the best Marvel movie made in a long time and definitely the best Spiderman movie that has ever been made. I loved the pace, the story and the acting. Such a nice surprise to meet all the Spidermen at once! There are true chemistry between the actors, you can feel the respect they have for each other, the Spiders and the three friends - it carries the movie. The balance between drama and comedy is on point, the special effects are something I haven't seen since I first watched the Matrix (it's mind bending!). Both me and my 12 year old daughter laughed and cried together in the movie theatre, we walked out of there smiling after a true movie experience.", "Everything a spider-man fan could ask and more": "This movie is hands down in the same league as MCU's other giants. Tom Holland really holds on his ground as Spider-man in this one with the magnitude of things transpiring near him. You'll cherish every part of this movie and will one day look back as a fond memory.", "absolute GARBAGE": "Literally Tom Holland playing Spider-Man started out to be cool and he did a great job in The avengers movie and in civil war but they should have left it at that, because I would have to say that the new Spider-Man is the absolute worst of all the Spider-Man movies. They made his character be the biggest cry baby, a whiny little child who literally messes everything up and his faults, no matter how much damage he causes, literally become his missions. And what I mean by that is he's just too soft. It always looks like he's about to cry, after I don't know how many movies now that he's been in his voice still hasn't gotten deeper so he hasn't grown up at all he's still just a child even in real life. And I know he's supposed to be in high school and his movies which they lucked out and he basically stayed young long enough in all his movies to play the part, but I am so annoyed by these movies that I literally had to shut this movie off 20 minutes into it because like I said he was great in The Avengers Infinity War and Endgame, and in Captain America Civil War, but his own movies are literally for an audience of 7-8 year olds.", "Great experience": "Very new, very bold and most importantly successful approach to how movies are made.Great actors. It was funny , full of action and emotional.If you love spiderman, dont watch the trailer, dont see any spoilers, just go for it , for sure you'll love it!", "Made me sad, it's all about the two studios' right over Spider Man": "Although I loved to see all the Spider Man movies connected together, it made me sad to realize that the reason for the movie was to solve the two studios issues over Spider Man's rights.I LOVED Spider Man in MCU, as an Avenger, and I feel that is close to an end...that's a shame, I would love to see Spider Man growing as a new Avenger leader.I hope I am wrong, but for me this movie was all about business...", "Man I'm so glad I got see it in Cinema.": "What a blast of a movie. Fun, emotional and well put together. It's amazing how this cast played together like well oiled machine, even after so many years!", "Almost achieved the expectation ! MARVELous !!!": "Firstly I have to say this is one of the best spider-man movie if not the best. The story,cinematography was excellent. Loved to watch Tobby & Andrew to act not just as guest appearance but almost in the second half (Sorry for the Spoilers :D). I deducted 1 point for only because of how marvel just wanted aunt may to make the mistake (trust norman) & force spider-man doing so, it was so straight forward to extend the story, I expected a little better from Marvel.But still in this Post-COVID era (hope so) worth watching a movie in the theatre. Enjoyed it.", "The greatest of the greatest spidey movies. A film from a fan to others": "I'll start saying that Tom Holland was right. This was really something, a 20-year-work in a single film. This is a film for everybody, for real. You may hate super hero movies and flying guys with capes, but it's really more than that. It's my childhood, my teenage years and my adulthood in a movie. It make you feel some stuff inside, unbelievably astonishing. I felt like a teenager again watching this movie. I'll just say. Watch it. Make yourselves this favour.", "Best ever super hero movie": "Spiderman was always the big super hero character and to see a movie like this that honor all that the spider-man represents is a wonderful thing. I would say that this movie is the best super hero movie ever, not just for the huge surprises but for the way the situations are solved.", "Boring and overly emotional": "I was so hyped for this movie, as I believe everyone was. This movie pulled so many un-logical moves, and made villians heroes. I mean it's cool to have all spider-man's in the same universe... But it is done poorly. The word \"love\" is said about dozen times, yet didn't hold any meaning nor push the narative in any way, shape or form. It was bland and overhyped. I know the film was made for the masses, but in my personal opinion, a good idea, not \"at all\" well executed.", "An absolute must watch!": "As stand alone-character Marvel movies go, this one is by far the best (in my opinion). It gets the balance of a new story and tonnes of nostalgia perfectly right. Don't want to say much more, watch it and enjoy it for yourself!", "Wow. Marvel magic...": "As a fan of Spider-Man and old enough to have seen them all when they came out I must say...I'm impressed. Without giving any spoilers away it's a true fan based movie for all Spider-Man fans.", "Great movie not an endgame killer like some people say": "This was a great movie but I feel like it was a bit overhyped like it is in Rotten Tomatoes. I have some mixed feelings about it and I also feel like I was expecting a bit more but I don't know what. The movie started great all the way to the climax but I feel like the resolution was a bit weak.I can't understand how some people say that this movie is better than endgame. The only that I can think about is that is probably the nostalgia kicking in.", "I Can't Believe We Live In A World": "Where this movie exists. God have mercy. My review needs 150 characters but it's truly hard to say anything after being in absolute awe for 2 and half hours.Do not watch this with anyone. Take the person/group you'll fan your soul out with.

It is great conclusion to the trilogy.Probably the best aspect of it was satisfying and great callbacks for hardcore Spider-Man fans.Visually it also gave a lot of phenomenal moments, but we already know that Marvel sets pretty high standard for visual spectacle , so it does not amaze me anymore.", "Spider-Man: way to go": "Really good. It started off a bit obligatory the first 15-20 mins. Also when I saw some of the actors, I thought, I'm probably not gonna enjoy this. The movie soon proved me wrong. Good acting, jokes on point, lots of twists and turns. Also, action scenes and emotional and funny scenes were alternated very well.It's a well balanced movie: it contains the strive for equality which is always there in Spider-Man movies, but it's not exaggerated as in a lot of movies these days. The jokes are subtle and well timed. And the emotional scenes are not too long. OK, maybe the amount of villains kept the movie from really digging deep into all of their souls. Nah, that's nitpicking.My only real criticism is that I do not like movies that take this long, almost two and a half hours. It did not bother me too much here, so that says a lot.", "A true movie for the fan": "This is the best marvel movie I have seen after the infinity war!!! There are so much details to cover but I don't want to spoiler any of you before you have seen the movie. I will definitely going to purchase the 4K after and watch it again and again because this is one at a time thing. You cannot duplicate this experience. Thanks marvel for this journey you guys put it through. And to everyone, enjoy every moment in it. It worth!", "Awesome..Spectacular..": "This is awesome..the biggest surprise marvel ever gave..i actually screamed at the theatre..so many surprises actually..this movie is a must watch on theatre..", "Wonderful experience that's a lot of damn fun!": "Just left the cinema and I gotta say the whole experience was so much fun. Like so many of us, as a fan of the original Spider Man movies and having an appreciation for Andrew Garfield's work in the Amazing spider man films, it was fantastic to see both Maguire and Garfield suit up again for this film and reprise their roles without missing a beat. They both did a wonderful job, but I really have to say I appreciate the weight and emotion Garfield brought to it... Maybe even moreso than Maguire and I loved him too!! That being said, Tom Holland brings a powerful performance to the film that feels earned after all he's done with the MCU.Seeing some of the original villains reprise their roles as well was such a treat, but I do feel that they wasted the potential with sandman and lizard, however Foxx, Molina and Dafoe (especially) absolutely kill it.Lastly, gotta mention how awesome then dynamic between Dr. Strange and Spiderman is in this movie. Its completely different than Ironman and Spidey but it still works so well. Whether you're a fan of the original films, the amazing spiderman movies or the newer ones, we can all find something to appreciate about this one, and also enjoy some smiles along the way.", "Celebration of cinema": "A treat for Spider-Man fans. Extraordinary visuals make this movie one of the best seen recently. It has Utilized all resources to create a masterpiece.", "Amazing all around": "This movie hit all the marks. Great pacing, script, actors and special effects. I'm glad they were able to get all the old villains because William Dafoes performance was unbelievable. Also, the chemistry between the three Peters felt natural and hilarious. As a fan of the original in 2002 I can say this will go down in history for spiderman movies.", "Not so good, as they wanted to be": "The story has already been seen in the spiderman - into the spiderverse, so no originality. The motivation of the villains is questionable and involuntarily strong, there isn't nearly enough tension. Conversations are shamefully poor, uninteresting, worn out jokes, everything is pretty superficial. At one point I wanted to leave the cinema, because of so many pathetic scenes. The effects are great as with all marvel movies, doctor strange gave this movie that dose of mystery and depth, and the plot revolves around him.At the end, it certainly doesn't deserve a rating over 7.5 and I hope that generations of young people do not see this as the pinnacle of cinema. Because that would be really devastating.", "Pathetic.....": "They showed Dr. Strange was stupid enough to cast a spell for stupid reasons and got defeated by Spiderman in his own mirror world. To make this new Spiderman hero, they made everyone look stupid specially including old spidermen & Dr. Strange.So Dr. Strange learned the magic to open the gateway, but the friend just opened it because he got Dr. Strange's ring. What stupidity was going on.If they had to \"cure\" all the villains, then all previous Spiderman and avengers movie make no sense. Then go back and cure Thanos with some antidote. Stupid writing.", "Daredevil fan": "When I first heard the rumors that Charlie Cox's DareDevil/Mathew Murdock was going to make a appearance I was excited but skeptical that the rumors were true. But a lot of the other rumors being true i became hopeful and when Kevin Feige confirmed that if DareDevil was to make a appearance it would be Charlie Cox would be the one to do so i was excited to say the least. And of course when he was in the movie even if it was for only a moment this movie instantly earned a 8 by meOther than it it was 7 but that one star goes to Charlie Cox himself.", "Gaspack": "The Movie is awesome. The Cameos are amazing (heh see what I did there). The end credit scene sets up something pretty interesting too. Just go watch it instead of reading a review.", "Amazing. Just amazing.": "This is the second review I've ever written and all I have to say that this was the most exciting movie I've ever seen. I don't care if some people think it's a theme park film, because it is!!! IT WAS FRRAKING FUN AS HECK!! And that's it. It was fun and that's all you have to know.", "NWH was good but...": "Just saw NWO and must say, was a solid movie.But I left the cinema with so many questions. I was hoping for just a bit more.1. Why bring Venom to NWO, without a fight? Got a bit dissapointed there. Was hoping that he would show up and give us a fight.2. Why not bring other villains from other spiderman Universes (not Maguire/Garfield Universe). Loved Doc Ock, Green Goblin and Electro. They could though have brought som other villains we never have meet before.3. Why did Ned and MJ forgot about Peter Parker? I understand they would forget, that he was Spiderman, but doesn't make sense they would forget who Peter Parker was. That's Neds best friend and Peter doesnt exist in his world anymore?Overall a good solid movie. I would go and watch it again.", "Not a perfect story!": "Not as good as everyone's saying. The story line is not profound and a bit messy. The Spider man character is still a kid and cannot be a merely hero in the movie.It was nice seeing the other spider fellows, but unfortunately the main reason that all this is happening is Tom holland being childish and selfish.", "A retcon fan service.": "20 years ago, as a 13 year old kid, I was thrilled about a Spiderman live action movie coming to theatres. I loved Toby Maquires version. When the trailer for the second movie aired back in '03/'04, I was even more thrilled! Now with Doc ock, performed so well by the brilliant Alfred Molina.Sadly, ignorant corporate management, intervient, with the third and it went down hill.I wasn't fond of the reboot with Andrew Garfield, even though he did a very decent spiderman.But many entered the marvel universe with Garfields version, and think of him as their Spiderman.Fast forward to No way home... WHAT A BRILLIANT WAY TO RETCON THE INTIRE FRANCHISE AND THE ALTERNATE VERSIONS!!Total fan service. The audience couldn't help but applaud when Garfield and Toby entered the scene. Even the score from the other versions was played doing the spidey-team-up. And what a way to re-introduce the intire village ensemble, with the original cast... I am speechless. My favorite is still Toby's Parker, but I am close to reconsider.It will break your heart as well \ud83d\udc94", "Spider-Man No Way Home...": "This new approach to the Marvel universe, the world of parallel universes, which began with the show \"What if,\" will, in my opinion, achieve a qualitative leap and great success.The movie is full of comedy, suspense, and excitement, the amount of feelings and passion is great to the point where sometimes you get feelings of joy and other times you see that intense sadness, great sadness to the point where you feel like crying, the amount of tragedies that Spider-Man went through from losing loved ones to friends, the idea of collecting the three heroes who played this character is very wonderful and thought the universes, The parallel provided justification for changing the actors who had previously played this character, as well as saving the evil.Finally, I wish everyone a pleasant viewing experience and will refrain from burning the events because I do not want to delve deeper into the details and beautiful scenes and ruin the fun for you.Good bye,everyone!", "really good movie": "Exciting to see this new spider-man movie, three generations of Spiderman in the same movie,that is really cool. I think it's a great movie for the next generation of the Marvel Universe and I'm really looking forward to the next phase of the Spider-Man movie.", "Best movie of 2021": "It is truly a wonderful and great movie. These are few words to describe how much emotion, comedy, shock and surprise the movie exceeded all expectations.", "modern movie": "Great movie overall.The first part is very dynamic and flows very fast, modern; second part slows down a little.It's an explosion of emotions due to the high sentimental charge that any of us carries about this character.By the way it's (not so) far from the perfection, firstly for the time/plot inconsistencies (unavoidable when mixing all that stuff together), but the biggest flaw is that very very very poorly shot embarassing scene of the face-to-face with goblin on the giant shield. Green screen poor quality like a 1980s movie, embarassing for a movie like this.", "What a movie!": "It's your usual friendly neighborhood spiderman, but taken to a whole other level. What a spectacle! Just seeing Andrew and Tobey back, together with Tom! I thought it was a dream that could never come true, but Im so happy they made it possible!", "Failed to fill expectations": "Overhyped. Not even close to endgame as declared by others marvel has no stories anymore they are just sticked at onle place after endgame. Marvel soon will be vanished if they dont go forward with the stories.", "One of the best movie experiences you will have": "Go see this movie. If your a fan if Marvel, if you have liked any spider-man movie of the past. Go see this movie. Its beyond amazing.The movie does not slow down from the moment it opens, to the very real and emotional ending. This film is what the world needed at a time like this. This movie easily rivals endgame.", "He tole the show.": "Andrew Garfield stole the show, the emotions this actor can produce is just unreal, look at Hacksaw Ridge. I just loved everything about this movie. Smiled the whole time and even had a few time tears in my eyes (Andrew catching Zendaya, the talk on the roof with the three spidermans,... .", "Finally a Spider-Man worth watching": "This is by far the best spider man MCU movie It's funny it's romantic It's funny it's romantic And heartbreaking all at the same time.When you watch the old mcu or even the older spider man movies, you always feel something is missing or you wanted more and this does just thatFrom the pacing of the movie to the climax and finally the end it's ALL WORTH IT to ofcourse the surprise 2 post credit scenes.", "OH MY GOD": "This is it. This is the Spiderman movie that I have been waiting for.The action is impeccable, the character interaction is flawless and the story is so good!I laughed, I cried, I cheered.INCREDIBLE!!!!", "Best movie of all time": "I'm just a kid born in 1995 and this is a easy Top 5 favorite movie of all time to me. So much emotional going on like I was on a roller coaster. It's even bigger than end game in my opinion but thing hits you.", "The best movie I've ever watched.": "Its AMAZING.The performances are flawless.The actors gave their all.Tom Holland had a perfect performance, and we got to feel what his character was feeling, it was just perfect as Peter Parker.", "Fun watch, but absolutely overrated.": "It was fun, it takes mastery to actually create something like this, and a lot of people and effort... so where it aimed, the movie totally succeded.But, it is a superhero movie, and if you've seen a lot of them, while this is probably among the best, it still doesn't break that 'barrier'.For me superhero movies can only do so much, good visual effects, humor, good score, pacing and not much more. It doesn't dwelve into anything deep, that will leave you thinking about it for months (12 angry men, to kill a mocking bird) or try to be unqiue (pulp fiction, memento, the game), it only tries to set a new standard in its own genre. And thats all it really needs to do...For a superhero movie, it's probably the score it has on imdb already, but I can't put it ahead of something like the movies I mentioned above...", "Overstuffed in the best way!": "This film is excellent if you've followed the saga the entire way through, and especially so if you're a Spider-Man fan. It's not a \"10\" for me, not because of any issue I had with it, but because I know there are elements that would be confusing for people who aren't as familiar, which takes a little bit away from it as a standalone film.But you don't have to be a die-hard fan to love and appreciate it! It just helps to have some of the background on the three series of films and the history of the character within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (or MCU). I'm a fan, but I've got friends and relatives who really loved the film once they got a recap of the pertinent points from a spouse or child.It really does work as an action film, a comic book film, and a drama and I think it's worthy of the praise it's received.", "Best Marvel Movie of All Time": "It's one of the best spiderman movies of all time! Just watch the movie. It's amazing. Well crafted movie. Loved the film score as well. I'd say it's a rollercoaster ride of emotions.", "Best spider-man movie ever i watched.": "With Peter Parker(Holland, owning the role) revealed to the world as Spider-Man, he and those closest to him have their lives ruined. He implores Dr Strange(Cumberbatch, compelling as always) to use his magic to help. And there is an attempt. But there are unintended consequences.If you're not interested in reading an extremely positive review of this, turn back now. I can't believe they actually did it. There's no way(eh?) that this should work. It should end up overstuffed, like Raimi's third entry did. Somehow, the fan service and nostalgia-bait does not overwhelm, and this has a real heart to it. The references are plentiful without ending up obnoxious. They managed to find a way to give the large cast enough character moments and pathos that I wouldn't want a single one of them removed. The balance between drama and comedy is on point. No one just disappears into the background, and this doesn't take away the tragedy of them. The action is big, not excessively so. A few awkward parts barely detract. The long runtime doesn't feel excessive.This features a little strong and suggestive language. If you care even a tiny bit about any fictional being that appears in this, I wholeheartedly recommend you watch it. 10/10.", "The best 2021 movie": "I did not really expect the movie to be like this. The storyline the concept of bringing all the old spidermen together was amazing. I really enjoyed the movie and i think it is the best movie of 2021.", "One of the strongest films in the entire Spider-Man franchise": "This masterfully combined the story arcs of all three Spider-Men and effectively used them to tell an engaging/entertaining story. The bar had been set very high and I'm hoping the next one can at lea match it.", "Story > Nostalgia": "This was arguably the most hyped MCU film since Endgame, and therefore carried a big burden of expectation. And with great power comes great responsibility.Unfortunately, this film relied almost completely on nostalgia from the past Spider-Man franchises instead of blazing it's own new trail. Other than us getting to see old faces again, it didn't give much of a plot line or struggle. The biggest conflict is Peter's self-inflicted, \"fix it\" moral compass, that does more harm than good and is ultimately very unnecessary,My biggest let down was the classic good vs evil, or lack thereof. There is a reason every good story ends with the good guy defeating the bad guy. But in this film Peter decides to try to save everyone, including his enemies, instead of doing what needed to be done to vanquish his world of evil. Cliche set ups were crafted so that we could get cheesy pay offs in the end, and it just didn't make sense. The world is not all rainbows and butterflies, and not everyone is good. Despite what modern Disney might want us to think.", "I'm Speechless!!!": "Years after years, we finally get to see this film that is going to be best Spidey Films than I've seen before but, this really shows how much we're such a huge fan of the character who has through so much as he fights his demons and he's not there alone to save the day. We may have an opinion(s) of which the franchise or films is the best but, mine is still go for Rami's version of Spider-Man and I think this NWH probably the best yet.", "No Words to describe This Masterpiece..

So many emotions, fan service, and out of this world special effects - very much a 10 amid a sea of Marvel classics.", "The Best Marvel Movie of All Time?": "It's incredibly hard to make a review on this movie without spoilers - so if you are reading this before seeing the movie and want to avoid spoilers scroll away! The best moments in this film contain spoilers.First, let's start on the introduction of Spider-Man in the MCU back in 2016 in Captain America: Civil War. The hype was high, rightfully so. Spider-Man has been a beloved comic book characters for decades and Tobey Maguire's first introduction to him on the big screen in 2002 created even more of a love. For me, personally, I've loved this character since that first movie as a child and it's carried all the way through adulthood with Tom Holland's version.Spider-Man has been nothing but great in the MCU. With the on screen relationship with Iron Man it was delightful to watch. Zendaya's portrayal of MJ and Jacob Batalon's of Ned are amazing and enhanced Tom's Spidey.In Far From Home and the Mysterio plot line it caused negative things for Peter Parker. With the talk of Multiverse in Loki it was a given we were going to see it in this movie. The cinematography, storyline, acting, CGI - it's nothing I've ever seen before in a film.Bringing back all the villains from Tobey and Andrew's Spider-Man movies was good enough, but Marvel yet again proved to do better. William Lafoe's Green Goblin is the BEST portrayal of an on-screen live action comic book villain ever. He was terrifying and hit the nail on the head - completely and utterly Oscar worthy.And of course.... Tobey and Andrew. Words cannot describe the hype in the theater when Andrew came through the portal. Not only them, but we also got Daredevil and Venom (cameos). It was more than I ever thought I needed and the amount of money i would pay to see this film for the first time again is absurd.If you are a long time Spidey fan, this movie will blow you out of the waters. Nothing will ever top it. Not even Endgame!", "Possibly the Best Spider Man Movie Ever!!!": "What can I say! After seeing this I had to make an account on here to rate it! This movie not only reached my expectations but also went past them! Holland's performance is his best of the \"Home\" trilogy. Seeing Doc Oc, Green Goblin, Sandman, Lizard and Electro come back was AWESOME! Their roles were not just appearances but really made the plot. Benedict Cumberbatchs' Dr Strange is fantastic and powerful as ever!Spoilers belowSeeing Tobey and Andrew and the interactions between all 3 Spidermen is seriously what makes this film great!!! They provide brotherly support to Tom when he needs it most. It's really heartwarming!A MUST SEE FOR SPIDER-MAN LOVERS!!!", "loved it": "This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood.

I loved every second of it!", "the Best THING I HAVE EVER WATCHED": "It was amazing, I enjoyed every second of it <3. It really is dream come true. It was fantastic and emotional . It truly is MCU's best creation yet. My recommendation to it.

It was a great way to bring all Spider-Man fans together from all movies to enjoy the one film. Having said that I think the execution could have been better. There were scenes like when all the \"Spider-Men\" were swinging around and fighting together which gave me goosebumps and nostalgia, but there was also scenes that made me scratch my head. Some dialogue was weird and awkward and was trying too hard to be funny. I think the main fight scene between everyone had some plot holes in it and didn't make sense, and doctor strange's decision making in the end left me a bit stumped as it seemed out of character and rushed. But overall, enjoyed the movie very much. Well done.", "An emotional masterpiece": "Spoilers belowThis incredible movie lived up to the hype, and probably exceeded it. At least from my standpoint. It was thrilling and exciting to see familiar faces return to the big screen and revisit their roles. Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield snapped right back into their old roles and it was like I was watching one of their movies again. Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina did an incredible job and it was like nothing changed. The acting and cinematics we're on par with Avengers: Endgame, perhaps even better. I look forward to what marvel has in store for these characters in the future, if they ever return.", "An absolute blast": "Is this film perfect? NoDoes it have some of tired superior tropes that many mcu movies suffer from? MaybeIs it and absolute banger and by far the single best Spider-Man to ever make it to the big screen? Hell yeah it is.", "The Movie Spiderman deserved.": "Spoilers***\nThis movie is a dream come true for every Spidey fan out there. I couldn't stop smiling the entire movie. It's just perfect in all senses. Everything that they tried to do worked and it worked to perfection. Every reference, every scene, every joke. This is THE Spiderman movie.I don't think we'll ever witness something like this on screen again in a long long time. The sheer ambition of the movie.The Spiderman Trio is the obvious highlight of the movie. Tobey, Garfield and Holland deliver in their roles perfectly and play to thier abilities. They managed to portray the differences and the similarities of Peter Parker across the multiverse wonderfully. For Tobey and Garfield, this movie plays the role of a ribbon on the neatly packed gift boxes of their characters. The fact that they managed to us the plot points from the earlier movies and make it work was excellent.Garfield saving MJ during the fighting and maybe absolving himself of the guilt of Gwen's death was beautiful. Tobey Maguire plays the role of the wise Peter Parker and delivers on that note in the same manner he did in Raimi's Trilogy. Tom Holland perfected himself as Peter Parker in this movie and elevated the character to another level. He also achieves the maturity of his fellow Spidermen in this movie and it is a delight to watch, albeit a painful one.Things did get a bit too much when it came to the villains in the movie but that is understandable given the scale of the movie and the limited run time. Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina reprising their roles, gave a better performance than most MCU villains to date. Green Goblin's arc was handled very well.And Zendaya is just perfect as always.All in all, this movie was simply a treat to watch. Easily the best Spiderman movie to date.", "Every fans dream.!": "The only thing o have to say is that this movie surpassed my hopes by a lot..its like a fan made movie!!!and the fight scenes had raw violence , something i hadn't see in any Spiderman movie imo... what an amazing experience to see this movie in IMAX..", "Not that great": "It was good to be in theaters with family after long time, but it was not the movie to keep you engaged all time.Didn't like the story line, that spider man is so foolish that he didn't make his mind and jumbled up his wishes while he of asking for help to change the whole world.Also, they tried it to make emotional but it was never felt any thing like emotional :(", "TOBEY AND ANDREEEEW": "I love the show. When Andrew appears i got goosebumps. My favourite superhero is spiderman. When i was 3 we went spiderman 3 in cinemas. My first cinema. And tom said great power and tobey said comes great responsibility, in that time my tears got away from my eyes.", "Nostalgic and Masterpiece!!": "A true rollercoaster of 90's kid! This movie brought back memories of my childhood! Finally, I see Tobey Maguire and Alfred Molina in theatre screen (My dream has come true)It's festival for me! Thanks for giving this movie to the world!Hats off to all!", "No Words.......": "One of the best Spider - man movie , I ever watched after Sam Raimi's Spider - man Trilogy .This movie gives every thing which fans wants From Sony and MCU from decades . Please go and watch this masterpiece and enjoy the New Spider-Man Cinematics Universe ............................", "Spider Man No Way Home is the best Spider-Man movie of all time.": "Spider-Man No Way Home has been one of the most hyped up movies off all time. Lets start up with the best thing this movie gave us and that is giving us all three Spider Men on the big screen. Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield brought back their original Spider-Man characters next to Tom Holland's Spider-Man. This brought back a lot of nostalgia for many Marvel and Spider-Man fans around the world. We also got to see the original villains from the past two Spider-Man franchises. Jamie Foxx really played the Electro character great and don't get me started with Willem Dafoe's performance as the Green Goblin. Some negatives of the movie are that the plot doesn't really make much sense with supposedly everyone who knew Peter Parker was introduced into the universe but one of the main villains Electro didn't know who Peter Parker was. Either way this movie is great and a great way to celebrate almost 20 years of Spider-Man being introduced on the big screen.", "Good but too hyped": "1st half of the film was shaky, it was jumping from scene to scene and it never explained anything properly. Second half picks up with the addition of Tobey and Andrew but they felt lifeless in the film, good final fight but they done everything way too easy, this could have been so much better tho still decent.", "A love letter to every Spider-Man fan.": "Takes one of the most hated story lines in comic history and turns it in to a film masterpiece. Changing things just enough to make a compelling story that redeems story lines for characters that we never expected to get redeemed in ways we couldn't have imagined. It also brings to light that the past two spider man (Tom Holland) movies are of a trilogy that shows Spider-Man coming into his own. All three of these movies are his origin story. Finally the third movie shows Spider-Man becoming Spider-Man. With great power comes great responsibility. Spider-Man stories are the best when he is at his lowest. NWH's ending shows Spider-Man at an all time low leading to many storylines threads in many different directions but some how making the trilogy complete. The stories from now on will not be about Spider-Man finding who he is and we may see him be a mentor to new characters and maybe a co-leader in the avengers or young avengers! Things will be interesting! This movie was amazing and Sony has the ability to make a lot more movies and stories that can cross over with any movie or tv show they want. I hope they use this responsibly and not make this crutch. Use this ability to create impactful stories not bringing characters back to life just for the sake of it.", "Marvel recycling": "Flat jokes, flat storyline, no chemistry between MJ and PP... not worth the watch. If you do want to see it dont go with hopes up, it is fine for average action flick.", "Lived up to what we wanted it to be": "Wow, just wow. This film was wonderful and from what we learned from the trailers, significantly different than what I thought. It was a classic Spidey story but with an awesome twist. The fan service put in with the 2 extra Spider-Men was great! There was a *perfect* amount of screen time for all of them in my opinion. There was also quite a bit of love put into the villains. They all retained their desires. Some just want power and to be recognized, others just wanted to get home to their families. I'm glad that all of this was tied into this film and wrapped up. Even the supporting characters such as MJ and Ned got nice little character arcs or changes that were very welcome! The overall story was very compelling with Peter and his classic Spider-Man moral dilemmas and the other, older and wiser spideys helping him overcome his selfish human desires to help the people that he loves. Just overall a very nice way to end all of the Spider-Man movies and to tie them into one epic story. I give it an 8.9/10.", "GIVE THIS FILM AN OSCAR FOR EVERY CATEGORY, INCLUDING BEST PICTURE!": "WOW!!!!(5x) I have to say, this film was AWESOME from beginning to end! Every performance from the cast were completely spot on, the cinematography and editing were excellent! The visual effects are stunning! The supporting cast were AMAZING! It's like going back to childhood all over again! I cried with joy at every single scene, and, boy, they did it right! I hope that there would be an extended cut sooner down the line! The film definitely deserves Oscars in all categories, including Best Picture! When it comes on 4K, I am adding it to my collection! Very highly recommended!", "This makes no sense at all": "This movie is a far cry from the comic book, it's crazy if it wasn't Spider-Man the whole world followed, but I want to say something, this is an unbearable regret.And as they say, this can never be a comic book movie. This is something that has not happened and it will affect some people and they will change the chef on their own, disinterested in money. This is nothing, and I must take some avoidance about this company. It may not do what the fans like, but it works for its benefit. I did not make myself an example of it for the sake of a despicable company that works for money or for fans\nThis is not what the ComicBook is talking about, I am a True real ComicBook.#TheRealMarvelFansAreDead.

I love how they tie in a lot of things from each spider-men and even throwing in some comic homages. Only thing I was disappointed in was the fact The Sinister 6 was not the Sinister 6 as I thought.

Most of people haven't read the comics but have dreamed that their favourite come together and marvel(Disney,fox,sony) made it happen now not only hero but their alternate version too as multiverse . Marvel did a great job journey is so awesome how they lost so many charecters and gain them back(not completely) but gave there best shot.", "A long-time favorite": "This is a movie I'd be willing to watch constantly over and over again. While the CGI effects are a bit off, it can be set aside with the conditions the film was created in and the amazing storyline behind it. No Way Home takes the immersive stories of its predecessors and wraps it into one finale of the Holland trilogy. While it ends this trilogy in particular, it paves the path for an amazing future for the MCU.", "Returning to childhood": "The movie is so great, I would watch it again every week.In my opinion, this was the best Marvel movie ever made. How everything is connected and have sense.... While watching movie I was feeling like little kid who loves Spiderman all my heart. And with great scenario, it gives me goosebumps.", "A solid 10/10 spiderman flick, best one in the mcu yet!": "It was good in all different ways, from the three spidermen to all of their villains, a solid story from start to finish. A sad ending, but that is to be expected from a spiderman movie that ends on the sight of the protagonist in a duneral setting or visiting a graveyard.", "The Culmination of 20 years of Spider-Man": "Absolutely the best film of the \"Home\" trilogy and one of the best Spider-Man films. Everything that was built up in the previous two films comes together. Rather than give Spidey his origin in one film, they made it an entire trilogy. He's no longer Iron Man, Jr. Or Spider-kid; he's Spider-Man at last (with probably my favorite suit yet).All of the actors are great. By far Tom's best performance. I was lukewarm on Zendaya at first but now I really like her MJ probably even more than Mary Jane and Gwen. Alfred returned to form, like he never left. Willem was in another league. He chewed all his scenes and was better here than in the first Spider-Man. There's also a supporting character that gives an incredible performance, but I can't say who.Much like the other Marvel films, the direction and cinematography don't stand out, but the choreography and fight scenes are entertaining and brutal, on par with Spidey's fights with Vulture and Goblin. One downside is you really need to see the other 5 films to fill in certain conversations if you haven't already. It helps a lot.No Way Home feels like a more mature sequel. It is an emotional, but fun ride and I can't wait to see it again. It leaves Spider-Man in an interesting situation where his story simultaneously could end or go anywhere it wants. I have no idea what Marvel and Sony will do but I'm curious to see. Definitely stay for the mid credits scene. The end credits is not a must but Marvel fans will enjoy it.", "Truth is painful": "Truth hurts, truth is painful...like the essence of our lives, there might be so many truths in so many universes, but they are all undeniable. As Elvis once said: \"Truth is like the sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain't goin' away.\" Now in this spider utopia, where the many sides of our memories unify through the most iconic pictures of our cinematic consciousness, we keep confronting the intolerable weight of reality through the language of most nostalgic fictional characters who shaped our childhood (classic Spider-Man), teenage years (amazing spider man) and youth (the avenger version). Heroes all unite to shout that the past is unbearable, present is challenging and the future...should be made upon our hardest sacrifices. Maybe that's what turns a regular guy to hero: someone who embraces the truth as harsh as it is, just to set the others free...a true hero will tragically and epically devote his love, friendship, family and a very normal life to pave the path of glory. He knows that \"with great power comes great responsibility\" even if he is merely \"your friendly neighborhood spider man\"... a true champion who pictures our purest dreams and lives like a brave warrior, or even harder: like a good man...", "The best Spiderman movie yet.

Spider-Man has always been my favorite superhero, and this is an absolute love letter to the character.INCOMING SPOILERS:\nMy heart nearly stopped when I saw Andrew and Tobey and they were so funny while being lighthearted and lovable like in their standalone movies. When Andrew caught MJ after Tom was snatched out of the air, it brought tears, as it did for Andrew (if you've seen TASM 2 you understand). Tobey almost had a father like character with his portrayal of Spider-Man in this film. Tom wanted revenge on Green Goblin so badly that he beat him senseless and was about to stab him with his board, but Tobey stopped him because he explained earlier that revenge doesn't create peace in him.All in all, I would watch this again. You will laugh, you will cry, you will cheer, and more. Spider-Man: No Way Home-hits home.", "More of a Spider-Man movie than an MCU movie": "I want to start by saying that this is the first review I've written after MANY years on IMDb. Because this movie deserves it.Going back to the review title, in my opinion, this movie ties more into the Spiderverse than the MCU. I've been following the MCU for a while, but haven't gone outside of that much until now. Given the roster of villains, I decided to watch the previous Spidey movies leading up to this. And I'm glad I did. Sure, this movie definitely touches on the lore within the MCU, but it's heart lies within the Spider-Man cinematic adventure. If you think you can go into this without watching the other Spider-Man movies because you're caught up on the MCU and you can enjoy it fully, you're wrong.Obviously this movie was highly anticipated and hyped. And it's worth it. It was so much more than it should have been. The only reason that I'm giving it a 9 instead of a 10 is because there are a few minor plot elements, mostly involving Electro, that weren't made clear enough, but none of those took away from the overall enjoyment of it. Every single actor was firing on all cylinders. The pacing was perfect. The emotional core was strong. The comedy was perfectly placed. And everyone looked like they were genuinely having a good time.Even though I've stated that this isn't an MCU film at it's heart, it of course is an MCU film in every other sense. And it's one of the strongest outings in the entire franchise. Up there with Infinity War and Endgame. Even if you don't fully enjoy the other Spider-Man movies, this will make it worth your time watching them. In so many ways.", "Most overrated superhero movie of all time": "I love marvel movies. Lets be honest, this is not even a good superhero movie. The story is bad with an abundance of logical flaws. Spiderman reminds me of Jar Jar Binks. The multiverse idea is the perfect excuse for logical gaps the size of an average multiverse...\nHow did this movie get among the top 10 IMDB movies of all time. I dont get it. These ratings must have been bought in my opinion. Feels like this 5* amazon product that actually sucks very much. Thank you imbd. I wasted money and time.", "BREATHTAKING": "I grew up with spider-man, he was one of my first known superheroes, I watched the first movies, the second series and finally I saw Tom Holland as spider-man and he was amazing, I loved his portret of spidey from the first scene and all the marvel movies with him where great and I had an amazing time. But never have I ever thought about something what I saw here. I was speechless. I saw just one trailer with Dr Octopus with the original actor from the first series with Toby Maguire. *SPOILERS AHEAD* I was glued to the film all the way but my mind was literally blown to pieces when multiverses colided and all the previous villans came WITH ORIGINAL CAST and then finally we saw what made me shiver with excitement and never stopped. Not only villans came to this part of multiverse but also other spideys. Andrew Garfield and Toby Maguire together with Tom Holand ladies and gentlemen I was excited like a baby. Three spider-man guys together it reminds me of one meme about it and how I thought it was just a picture which will never come true but oh boy was I wrong. It was marvelous I can't describe it You need to watch this a dream come true and a surprise with little something to those who watched all the movies, the hints where everywhere I..I can't it was magical go watch the movie You will not be dissapointed.", "Delivers on every level": "This movie hits every mark I was expecting walking into the theater and then hit more after that. The performances from every actor/actress hit on the emotional level that no Spider-Man film has hit before.", "If you like this type of movies, this one will not disappoint.": "I will start with things that I liked about this movie, First of all, the cast brings a lot of charisma to the film. That's a common thing for MCU, but this one has a little \"army\" of good actors: Tom Holland, Willem Dafoe, Jamie Fox and many others. The action is interesting and it's pretty difficult to get bored. What was truly interesting was the interaction between the characters. The plot wasn't too complicated which surprised me because we are talking about a movie with a combination of 3 universes. Besides all that, I really liked the final because it was mature and unpredictable and Spiderman didn't get a happily ever after, as I expected.What I don't like about the film is the fact that it's too childish at some points. A good example is the fact that Doctor Strange did a universe-changing spell without even talking, at least, one hour with Peter about the rules and the consequences of this spell before doing it. And there are more examples like this. Another thing is that some characters are too chill in some situations and that's unrealistic. Like that old lady who asked Spiderman (Andrew Garfield's) to clean that web from the corner after 2 minutes since he arrived through an interdimensional portal in front of her eyes. I know that's for the sake of comedy, but bad timing with this type of jokes make the film look like a parody at some points. But humor is subjective, so I guess that's just my opinion. There are some good jokes too, but this time comedy was not the strong point of this movie.In conclusion, if you are looking for something refined, abstract, sophisticated and deep, this is not your movie. If you just want to have a good time at the cinema or you like superheroes movies in general, it's totally worth watching.P. S. Sorry if my writing is odd. This is not my native language.", "Emotional ride": "This movie has emotional ride it express in your tears and action scenes you can't blink your eyes while seeing Eye feast to all mcu fans and congratulations to Tom Holland he is the soul of the film.", "A Pure Treat of Fan Service. A Celebration of Spider-Man!": "Well... where do I even start? I guess starting at where\nthe movie took off would be best, right off the events where Far From Home ended. JJJ has revealed the not-so-secret identity of Spider-Man, and you get to see Peter in spontaneous disbelief, eloping with MJ in his Spider-Man attire, web slinging and all. The movie wastes no time at showing what it wants to show, and does it very well!Jon Watts has clearly evolved as a director and took advice from the criticisms the previous titles had (which I am no fan of), worked on them and built upon and improvised on what was already good. So props to him for that, I think this is the best of the trilogy at date.Back to Spider-Man; Tom Holland, in general, I really think is a great actor and he wastes no potential at performing as Spider-Man here, outshining his previous acts of the same character. His acting is great and the well written character he plays just adds up on that. Yes, he is no longer a Spider-Man trying to be Tony Stark and has become a genuine no-joke adaptation of the beloved web-slinger, and nobody can take that from him!That does not mean this is the definitive portrayal of Spider-Man. Oh no, far from it, as he still has a lot to learn about responsibility, and the film does acknowledge this, starting off by him and his buddies talking about their future and goals, which is just sweet to see as when we first saw him he was clearly nothing of that sort. Then come the villains who broke through the barriers of the multiverse who begin to teach him about responsibility (This is not a spoiler, it was literally advertised they show up) along with the supporting cast, both new and old, who in all ways mentor him about responsibility. It makes me feel glad the crew took advantage of what they had and took their time to slowly establish and develop upon the characters cast to finally deliver to us the big epic Spider-Man movie we longed for! It makes me go easy on the previous two titles and I'm sure it does for the others who weren't fans of them as well. After seeing how Tom's version has started to resemble the original Spider-Man himself, you will be in awe.Unlike the previous films, this one is self-contained and while it is connected to the MCU, it does not feel like that's a burden or a convenience and really feels like a genuine Spider-Man movie with big themes, ideas, drama and surprising heavy moments. That's new and good, as the previous ones were clearly happy-go-lucky and playing it safe, being stairs for the Avengers lore to continue with no major moments.Then there is A LOT of comedic relief in this movie, nothing shocking if you've seen the Jon Watt Spider-Man movies. Yes, many of the the jokes do hit and can get you to chuckle and laugh wholly, but there are a few which don't hit the spot and can either make you pity laugh or not laugh at all. This is mainly due to, what I feel, the marvel formula where there is often a gag every then and there in the movie, which can sometimes meddle with and ruin the scenes with serious tension and when the stakes are high and genuine. But this is definitely not a huge problem and won't be a problem for a lot of audiences as these are very few. Definitely not as extreme as Thor: Ragnarok, lol.While the action choreography isn't bad, it's nothing great or new either (except the ones with Doc Ock, those ones will always be cool). Some have too many cuts making it difficult for the viewer to understand who's hitting and who's being inflicted with blows, and sometimes too dimly lit making you squint to view the action sequences better. But the parts with web combat aren't bad at all.Then what else, the screenplay! Huge props to the screenwriters for writing an almost perfect screenplay as they balance out what seems like an overwhelmingly major premise being displayed on the big screen. For a script requiring to link all the events from way back to Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy that took off in 2002 till now, that is absolutely crazy and very complex to design as a cohesive piece I would imagine. Yet, the movie walks on it's own legs gracefully without distracting problems.Concluding, this is a blast of sheer indulgent nostalgia where the movie talks to YOU and cherishes the moments with the characters you grew up with. Kudos to Sony and Disney for sending a true love letter to Spider-Man fans. By far one of my favourite Spidey flicks. I'm also excited for Tom and his future for the character as he's gotten better in each film.As this is my first movie review on IMDb, it was for sure a great start and a film which is worth your time to view more than once in theaters while you can, as that is a treat in itself with all Marvel fans cooped up together cheering, clapping and laughing their hearts out all throughout this beautiful tribute. TRP said it best, the audience turned the theater into a stadium.Ever since Endgame happened, it is fresh to know the hype for these films haven't died and thrive even when the virus is at large. No matter what fan you are, either of Sam Raimi, Marc Webb or Jon Watts, you will walk out of the cinema in pure joy and happiness.", "What a surprise!": "First of all, I can't say that the movie is very good. The lowering of the age standard of the film made the film out of the standard. In my opinion, it has not come close to his old films in any way. In short, this movie has turned into a children's movie. It's really surprising that it's rated so well. I think this movie was just a kid's movie.", "Best Spiderman movie ever!": "And I don't say that lightly! Great movie. Very emotional especially if you're a die hard Spiderman fan like myself! Very funny and entertaining. Thoroughly enjoyed it and going to watch it again next week! Can't wait for the 4k blu ray release :D.", "A PIECE OF ART": "John Watts delivers the best Spidey movie. Everything is well balanced.The comeback of Tobey's & Andrew's Spider-Man into the universe of Tom's.Cox's lawyer.The Spideys ability of being able to protect the box while tom is outside his body.The fight with Doctor Strange based on maths.The final combat with Tobey, Anrew and Tom against Molina, Foxx, Ifans, Haden and Dafoe.Everything.The movie can live up to the hype.", "It's overrated.": "I think the movie was quite successful compared to an action movie, but its subject matter and content was just action, and Marvel wanted to play 3 spidermans in the film because marvel noticed this lack of content, and as a result, the film didn't bore any fun, but it didn't have any deep content.", "Movie is enjoyable but entry of tobey and andrew could be better": "Movie is enjoyable but entry of tobey and andrew could be better. I think it looks like the entry of tobey and andrew has done forcefully.bbnnnn njnn\nJjjj\nBnnn\nJkkk\nJjjj.", "A Once In A Lifetime Film": "There is never a dull moment in Spider-Man: No Way Home. At a lengthy two hour and twenty-eight minute runtime, every scene still feels effective to the plot and moves the story along in a rapid fashion. This film truly is the culmination of Spider-Man films-from the Raimi era to the present series. Director Jon Watts hits all the right beats in capturing the character and feel of all these films. You will cheer as you experience nostalgic Spider-man tropes and elements from your childhood, you will laugh at the confusion of multiversal characters interacting (\"The Avengers? Is that a band?\"), you will even cry for some of the heaviest and most well shot scenes in Spider-Man film history. I truly believe this is a perfect Spider-Man film and the best Marvel film to date. SPOILER ALERT: I do not know if I will ever experience a similar feeling in the theater as the feeling I had when Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield returned. The union of three generations of Spider-Men on the big screen is a spectacle and surreal moment for all Spider-Man fans! Yet, their appearances were not needed to make this film a great film.

It was a cinematic masterpiece that gave so much nostalgia. The inner child in me came out and I really felt like such a giddy kid at Disney world. I grew up watching all the Spider-Man movies as a kid, and of course Tobey Maguire was my favorite. He's the og and he's the reason I absolutely adore Spider-Man. Then Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man movies came out and I loved those just as much, but of course I hated the ending in the second one. Now on to Tom Holland's Spider-Man, and I have to say, he's incredibly good. He nailed that role. All of them are so amazing and play such a unique Spider-Man.Now on to the movie. Every part was amazing, it didn't feel dragged out or anything. Of course more time would've been nice, but it was still fantastic. It was so cool to see Daredevil in it for a little bit. That scene where he fought doctor strange was just mind-blowing. I had a feeling Aunt May was gonna die, especially since she said that famous quote from Uncle Ben in Tobey and Andrew's movies. Absolutely heartbreaking, but it builds on to the character development. I just knew that Tobey and Andrew would be in this movie, but a small part of me doubted it so that I wouldn't get my hopes up. But when they came on to the screen, it felt so surreal and the audience went wild. It was so incredible to see all of our favorite Spider-Man on the screen together. I loved seeing them and their interactions. My favorite part was when MJ fell and Andrew's Spider-Man caught her\ud83d\ude2d like, it felt so heart-warming and it genuinely brought tears to my eyes because we all know he couldn't save Gwen, but he just had to save Tom's MJ. And you could see him getting all teary eyed and it just made that moment even more special. Honestly that was one of the greatest scenes and I just keep replaying it in my head. I have never seen an audience go this wild (even compared to Endgame/Infinity War) when Andrew swooped in to save her, there was so many applauds and \"awwws\" all around. Truly magnificent. I absolutely loved it.The ending was bitter-sweet. We said goodbye to our favorite characters and I hate that everyone forgets Peter Parker (Tom), but it makes sense and we all know he will get MJ and Ned back. The first post credit scene was hilarious. Venom was there the entire time and rather than destroying stuff, he just sat at the bar and drank away. Him leaving behind a piece of the black goo stuff feels like another Spider-Man movie will be in the works. If that's the case, I really hope to see Venom/Eddie, Harry Osborn, and maybe even Gwen Stacey.The directors and all cast and crew truly did such a phenomenal job on this movie. It's really everything I wanted and more. Absolutely incredible. I can't wait for it to come out on a streaming service or DVD so I can just keep rewatching it. Also super excited for the future interviews for Tobey and Andrew. Again, this movie was beyond amazing and I can't believe it actually happened!!!", "So eh am to do all all well Tom": "Italy items items usual Kala khaled pans handy Iranian organic Cindi cubic dictionary domains Clara William own jacks runs do is emit duck mini kid.

I used to enjoy more of the spider man movies but this one didn't satisfy me and I felt things are in a loop of being repeated. Although the visual effects were great but I guess that was it and maybe a fee humorous moments. Especially, to me the way that the movie wrapped up was not that much great.", "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious": "They nailed it. Tom's acting is really great. Everything about this movie is awesome. I managed to watched the first show in the country. Can't explain the experience.", "Better than Endgame (personal opinion, non spoiler review)": "I had the privilege of watching the first midnight screening of Spider-Man: No Way Home, in theatres here in Sydney, Australia (12AM Thursday 16th of December) and left with mixed emotions but was overall awestruck. This film made me smile, laugh and tear up. Seeing Willem and Alfred reclaim their roles as Spidey Villains on screen nearly 17 years later was amazing and nostalgic, as well as seeing Electro and Lizard from the Andrew Garfield Spidey Saga.We all loved the conclusion to the Infinity Saga, Avengers: Endgame. But I believe the nostalgia of watching Spider-Man movies truly hit the heart when watching this film in comparison to seeing Avengers: Endgame in theatres.People were cheering, the hype was intense and everyone was engaged every minute of the film.Some people may see this as biased, but considering that this Spider-Man film is a solo hero movie, I must say my focus on the film felt much more engaged watching this in comparison to when I watched Endgame, although I love both films for their own qualities.And to be fair, Spider-Man has always been my favourite Marvel hero.If you've seen the film too, don't spoil it for others. Let them experience the film for themselves. Don't ruin it.", "A GRAND FINALE IS THE BEGINNING OF SOMETHING BIGGER.": "If \"Endgame\" served as a culmination to the story of a 10-year project, it was also a tribute to its 21 previous films. With \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" we are facing the same case. A great ending to Tom Holland's trilogy and an amazing tribute to our friend and neighbor Spider-Man.Fans of the character will leave the cinema with a headache from so many emotions. Having gone to the preview, I have been able to feel the reaction of the most diehard fans and the general sensations, like mine, have been of euphoria at what we were seeing on the big screen, reactions very similar to those experienced with Endgame. With a second review, I think it surpasses the last installment of \"Avengers\" and fights first place in my ranking of MCU movies with \"Infinity War\".The expectations and buzz surrounding this film have been enormous, both on social media and through the campaign of leaks and rumors. Having seen the film twice, honestly, Marvel has managed not only to fulfill the complicated task at hand but to go a step further in terms of quality and dramatic depth in this third installment of Tom Holland's arachnid.The most recurrent criticism that has been made of this Spiderman of the MCU was its immaturity and clumsiness. That feeling, promoted by the characteristic Marvel humor and the lighter tone, that they were films with little dramatic content and tending towards childishness. Although, in my opinion, these criticisms were made without considering the age of the character (Peter is 15 years old in Homecoming and I think it is logical that he would do stupid things typical of his age), it must be said that this time, whoever was not happy with the lack of drama and epic moments will be, I think, more than satisfied now when they see what \"No Way Home\" delivers.The film shows us the passage from adolescence to maturity of the character and, with such an important change in the life of a person, our hero faces the weight of the responsibility that falls on his shoulders since he decided to put on the suit.That sense of major changes, of character evolution, of gaining new experiences but losing others, is present from almost the beginning of the film and is at the heart of it. This is a film about Peter Parker and his growth as a character, and it embraces that concept to the hilt.It is a film with a lot of action. It gives practically no respite at any point\nand has, obviously, Fan Service everywhere. But a fan service is well used. Here it is used in an argumentatively coherent way, and I can say that I enjoyed it very much.The performances are very good, Jacob as Ned turns out to be a good comic relief, Zendaya in small doses demonstrates her acting ability and, in every scene, she shares with Tom, they manage to convey charisma for the couple. Holland manages to convey the emotional weight of the character. Benedict Cumberbatch shines as always. Jamie Fox, you can see him enjoying a little redemption with Electro, for Alfred Molina it is as if he had continued playing Octavius. But Willem Defoe as Green Goblin is sublime, he is only present 20 minutes in the film and manages to convey that sense of tension in the film.Going a bit beyond what has already been mentioned, I think this film is still a love letter to the character's fans and a tribute to Spider-Man's cinematic history. The director, John Watts, and the actors always seem aware of this. The affection, respect, and admiration professed for the wall-crawler, which can be seen in the way certain moments are filmed, is so broad, that it is very easy to get emotional while watching the film.There is nothing more to add, I sincerely believe that this is a film event of the highest quality. I sincerely hope you enjoy it as much as I have.", "Definitely better than End Game\ud83e\udd23 *in my opinion*": "Seriously don't listen to any comment that have given this movie a star below 9\ud83e\udd23 THIS MOVIE WAS A DREAM COME TRUE FOR EVERY SPIDERMAN FAN IN THE WORLD!\ud83d\udca5 I don't wanna give out any spoilers\ud83d\ude07 Please just watch this movie before someone spoils it for you.", "Great Fun": "They just did everything they needed to do.

And i was glad, it was good but the movie dragged it out. It tended to be more of a drama than an action movie. You had some action at the beginning of the movie as the story started, but then almost one and half hour of waiting for the end, which wasnt that spectacular. At the end i was dissapointed with the execution since they could have done it so much better. Same thing as in Shang Chi unfortunately... I guess Infinity War and End Game will never be repeated and will remain the greatest of them all.", "Amazing (spider-man)!": "This movie contains everything a spidey fan wants!

For instance, why would Dr Strange be so inconsiderate to cast a so bad spell?Octopus and Goblin gave the movie more pull, but other villains were just too obvious in their behaviour like Sand Man and Electron.MJ could improve her acting.The three spider-men could have spent some time together before bonding, so to show us how they look inside now.I'll give it a second chance and re-watch it in a few weeks.", "Review on NWH spoiler free": "The movie was so good and displayed beautiful visuals honestly the movie is a 10/10 for me if you've watched all of the Spider-Man movies and marvel movies.", "The best Marvel movies": "Fun, funny, emotional, and excellent.The best hero movie adaptations\nBetter than any DC movies ever made\nThe point is so CRAZY.................CRAZY\nCRAZY\nCRAZY\nCRAZY\nCRAZY\nCRAZY.", "i love it wooooww": "The movie is crazy, you have to watch it, is one of the best Marvel movies.

It is obvious that we have to talk about the Spider-Verse how amazing the put Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire in the UCM it is just incredible, or just how good the acting of Andrew it's.

Great reintroduction of characters from previous sequels for non try hard fan, mostly using humor and I'm totally amazed how they did that and worked very well. The film doesn't feel rushed at all considering they have 7 characters they have to reintroduce.Great cinematography, i love the camera works when Peter come home after got doxxed, the 'one shot' i think it's called?. It's amazing how they set the final battle on dawn, its a beautiful moment when three of the Spider-Man hugging each other and when Peter have to say goodbye to their friends. It truly sets up a sad ambient for the audience to cry to considering this movie probably going to be the last we saw Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield with their suits on. Don't forget the mirror dimension scene, i think its very cool and trippyThis is the best of Tom Holland. The emotion on his face is just amazing how he did that. The look he gave to Willem Dafoe on the final battle, so dreadful and full of rage, my personal favorite. The look he give to Zendaya and Jacob Batalon on the epilogue, the body language he gave when he wants to tell something to someone but he can't is just truly understandable to the audience. And the sad realization looks on his face when he realized Aunt May is going to die sets up a really sad and dark scene.The writing is beautifully well. It's amazing what they did with Doc Ock, they stick with the Raimi trilogy about how he would have used the arms if he are the one that in controls. Same goes with Sandman, he protected Peter before he know that he's in another universe. They did Green Goblin very well, how he convince other villains to fight Spider-Man. And overall i like the way that they stick with the previous sequels, how they make these villains not an unreasonably evil villains, but a confused and lost human being.A lot of great callbacks to previous sequels. I notice lot of them because i rewatched the previous sequels 2 days before. The bridge scene with Doc Ock fight callback the TASM 1 bridge scene when Andrew fighting lizard on their first encounter, i notice the cars got thrown out the bridge and Spider-Man catched it with his web. The final battle there's TASM 1 iconic image of final swinging scene where Andrew posing with full moon on backgrounds but now it's 3 Spider-Man. There's Spider-Man 1 final battle callbacks and it's before May died when the glider impales her from the back, and the final battle between Tom and Goblin intense fight are pretty similar with the previous one. They recreated the iconic Sandman pose with one hand trying to reach something. TASM 2 when Andrew create that combination of webs to direct the power to electro, they recalled that on Tom's first encounter with Electro. They did Andrew very well for saving MJ because he couldn't before. \"My back\" joke from Raimi trilogy never gets old.The Conclusion were written very well. How they made this Peter Parker from this lucky superhero gifted with an incredible mentor, connections and tons of tech to a broke college student with nobody that only start with an experience he has and advice from other people he looks up to, to becoming this independent superhero. I like what they did with the suit i love it so much how they made Tom's new suit inspired by previous Spider-Man(s) I'm very excited what they do with him on the next trilogy. And I really hoping that they could do Endgame style credit scene but with previous Spider-Man actors and villains but no problem. 100/10 Great movie, great way to close the high school trilogy and open the another trilogy.", "Best Spider-Man Movie Yet.": "Spider-Man: No Way Home is a great celebration and culmination of Spider-Man movies from the past 20 years. It stars Tom Holland, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield in their roles as Peter Parker once again. And they aren't just quickly shoved in at the end to team up and fight together. They are in it for just over a third of the movie. The movie also brings back many villains from their franchises.The dialogue is some of the best in a Spider-Man movie and can be funny and dark when it wants to. I loved how the Spider-Men interacted with each other and the villains. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon were also amazing in this movie.I can't say a single bad thing about this film. I loved the references and jokes. I loved the characters. I loved the fight at the end.The final scene also sets up Tom's next trilogy as Peter. It is emotional and extremely interesting to see how they will go about this change.Here's to another 20 years of Spider-Man movies.Also, They recreated the pointing meme. Twice. That's a big ol' win to me!", "ITS SO GOOOOD": "All the acting, the story everything all in all is perfect. I really just wanna forget everything and re-watch this masterpiece.

I ever thought that marvel will make an another endgame level movie in such a short time. Thanks to John watts,Kevin feige,Sony and marvel for creating such a marvelous movie.

I give this movie 10/10.", "Loved every second of this movie": "I have never EVER written a review for a movie anywhere but I felt that I had to show some love\nfor this movie.

Stan Lee created this legendary proverb for one of the greatest superheroes, Spider-Man. 'No Way Home' also focused with the same theme. We've seen Tobey, Andrew and Tom as Spider-Man. But, Holland's Spider-Man did the biggest sacrifice ever in this epic film. And, if want to know about the post-credit scenes? I'll say it was 'insane'!", "Best Marvel movie after Endgame": "Truly a Masterpiece. One of the best Spiderman and MCU movie. Tom Holland nailed it by his acting skills. Worth watching. Engaging and unexpected storyline, filled with lots of goosebump moments and emotional moments. The theater environment was full of claps and whistles. Being a MCU fan, i really enjoyed this movie.

From the best actions sequences to heartbreaking and emotional scenes, this cinematic masterpiece provides the best portrayal of the comic book character we have ever seen in history. Some argue the first act was not much, it isn't true as it brought up the story and developed it well leading up to the 2nd act. Its fan service is positively at its best, with a great and dark storyline. And most importantly hats off to Tom Holland for the absolutely amazing acting, he captured the essence of the character well and easily deserves to be rewarded. This is arguably one of the most beautiful\nand creative pieces of artwork marvel has ever come up with. Definitely the best Spiderman film of all time. It really is a tear-jerker. This film exceeded my expectations as an enjoyable film I can watch thousand times and never get bored of it. Thank you to Jon watts and the hardworking team behind it and of course marvel studios. Credits and cheers to one of the best portrayals of a villain I've ever seen in Willem Dafoe's Green goblin and the other brilliant actors including Jamie Foxx who showed his class. This also brought out one of the best performances I've ever seen from the talented Zendaya who nailed the role of MJ and the talented Jacob batalon showcasing ned Leeds at his best. The cinematography in this film is remarkable and the beautiful shots of the scenery and the camera work were golden. I Loved the film and recommend it to anyone who has a deep love for comic book films and even the people who enjoy watching movies in general.

(No Spoilers)": "This movie is ridiculous and annoying from start to finish. I love the spider-man chracter althoygh think looking back that Toby Maguires trilogy is head and shoulders above anything that followed it. I liked that version because it built on character and had a progressive plot an toby is also a good actor, better than the other two that followed. Maybe we aer so desperate to be entertained by a good movie during covid that everyone is just happy to have another marvel movie out but all i saw was dumb after dumb move. I cant stand it when a movie makes super dumb decisions in order to generate a plot an also does stupid things in order to attempt humour. The visuals are of course fantastic but guess what...the best characters and by far those from the original spider-man trilogy. The majority of this movie i sent cringing from the attempts at romance and from the the floods of tears which clearly had no impact on me at least and i found it heard to believe anyone else either. All of this entire plot was of course created in the most absurd manner and from a spidey who somehow became the biggest idiot at just the right moment for just long enough. Dr Strange makes an appearane - no spoiler there - and even he managed to stupify the situation rather in order to ensure the movie plot opened up. Can't directors find another way not to make characters do utterly stupid things in order to make the movie unfold? Does it take the wrong type of imagination?Some of the main action is great but i found the humour mostly not funny and focused far too much on the nostalga too the point where you were like..yes yes i got it, that was a joke of some kind, well done.Maybe you will lap this all up but i cant be bothered to write more about it as everyone will see it now anyway which means it is going to be a huge success rather than get the average rating it deserves.The 5 stars is for the special effects and the moments of action which are few and far between and where they dont rely on stupidity taking place. So mostly here the older characters are involved.", "Cinematic Experience of Highest Level": "Loved the film through out. Having Bag full of Surprise makes it so special. It's one of the finest films of 2021. Thoroughly enjoyed it.

Should be changed to \"Men are juvenile to can kill some people\", because he indirectly killed May. Feel that Marvel is in trouble, has not written an impressive script, only know how to continue to make money elements arbitrarily piled up, Spider-Man is still a young boy, and Marvel has stumbled.", "the best film.": "Many exhilarating scenes, the film was fulfilled with joy, emotional and motivational. It is linked to what happened after spiderman's identify has revealed and moreover, it is also related to multiverse too.", "Great special effect and characters but nonsense story": "The story is dull and nonsense.

I would say their marketing is very successful.The highlights are the special effects and Doctor Strange.", "Long waited dream of the Spiderman Fans": "The Spiderman fans were divided into 3 categories: Tobey Maguire one, Andrew Garfield one and Tom Holland one.

I loved the film!", "The madness": "I hardly get overly emotional over films, but this one had me in my feelings by the end of it!The fact that all three Spider-Men that I grew up watching were all in the same film was extremely cool!!!!!!I am glad that I was able to experience that in the same room with so many other people.My screening was almost packed and for the first time ever, people actually cheered!!!!!!!I'm from the UK and that is not a common thing like it is in the US...\nNot everyone cheered unfortunately but it was enough for me to realise just how important these characters mean to some people!!!!! Including me!As soon as Andrew Garfield came through that portal, people went crazy!!!Spider-Man No Way Home is absolutely breathtaking!!!!!!", "Masterpiece.": "Something in this movie for everyone. It was visually astonishing, best character development in any Marvel movie, brilliant acting, and had an incredible balance of raw emotion and humor.

Overall the best Spider-Man movie in my opinion. Spider-Man/Tom Holland is now carrying the MCU, his next trilogy is something I look forward to with anticipation.", "Loved it, but I have a problem...": "The movie was incredible, the people was right about their teories, they got what they wanted to see, the Spider-Verse in a live-action movie, ok, sounds good, but is not the greatest Marvel movie of all time, for me, it isn't.Marvel and Sony did what the people wanted, made possible the Spider-Verse with the excuse of introducing the Multiverse for future sequels to come, with lots of Spider-Man's fan service with lots of references to the previous movies, making appear previous villians from previous movies and also, their previous Spider-Man's.That's it, I don't understand the exciment for the movie, yes it was great watching Tobey and Andrew again on their roles, but I have a problem with this kind of movies, the company does what the people want, inevitably it was gonna happen, inevitably, but I think they did it very very early, I don't know what will we have tomorrow.", "Greatest movie": "This was such a beautiful movie. The best thing I've experienced this year and I haven't been to a movie theater since IT 2 came out in 2019 I believe. The actors really did their thing especially Tom Holland this is the best role I've seen him as Spider-Man. It felt like no one outshined him in this film and for the most part the film made sense and didn't feel forced , rushed , or cringey. It was absolutely perfect and this film brought a nostalgic feeling bringing me back to childhood which had me feeling so good inside. The crowd was amazing felt like before Covid times. At my movie theater I went to the they had motion seats where your seats move during action scenes which had me enjoying it even more. Also half of my tickets were free because someone's friend never showed up so he left the free tickets at the consession stand. My favorite scenes were SPOILERS when Tom Holland's spider sense was tingling and he knew Goblin was about to attack , the fight scene between Tom Spider-Man and doctor strange, seeing goblin and all the other villains, Jaime fox joke about there being a black spider man out there , the fight scene at the end, when the Spider-Men from my favorite Toby McGuire universe and the other Spider-Man universe came together, when the second Spider-Man saved Mj, I just loved it all really love how Spider-Man had to make sacrifices in this film and how he matured into a grown man in this film. I loved the action scenes and i felt Aunt Mays death was realistic and i felt sad for her and really felt the emotion from Tom in this scene. I really feel Stan Lee would've been proud please go see the movie it was so worth going to the theater and watching it's a special film. I'm excited for the next Marvel multiverse phases and possible next Spider-Man film after seeing Eddie Brock /venom in the credits scene.", "The Best Spiderman Movie Ever": "As I was very excited about the movie after watching the first trailer.

This movie consist of emotions , humor, great fight scenes, go and watch it now, you will understand what I mean. Not sure if we will see all of them again sharing the screen.All our fan theories came true\nDaredevil, three spiderman, venom.", "Epic!!!": "Nothing to salve, just love it.

It's a mature movie that knows its tools and invests in them.Tom Holland gave his best Peter Parker/Spiderman performance yet. Marisa Tomei is great as Aunt May. Each villain also had good screen time. Alfred Molina as Doc Ock was really cool and funny, but my favorite villain was Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin.

This movie has been waited for a long time and it wasn't a dissapointment at all. I'm excited for the future of the MCU and all the upcoming films.", "Best live-action Spider-Man movie to this day": "I've read complaints about this being all fan-service. Well... that's what a cinematic universe is: connections to previous movies. Isn't ALL comic book movies suppose to be fan-service? Like you know the characters and storylines and you adapt them to the big screen whether is live-action or animation filled with hints and throwbacks. Or comic accurate representation within a scene. If it's not that, then... is not faithful to the source material? There's no actual middle point in all of this.This is meant to be part of a cinematic universe. That is you NEED to see the previous movies or at least know what happened before. And now it is actually connected to the previous standalone live-action Spider-Man movies so it is now a cinematic MULTIVERSE, kinda crazy but pretty clever. That's why is stupid to call this \"fan-service\" because it has nothing to do with showing stuff just for the sake of it. This is the story that the movie is trying to tell. You wouldn't call Stan Lee cameos fan-service because it's a tradition. People need to start leaving behind the fan-service mentality and start to accept that the cinematic universe building with well-known or new comic book characters appearing on the big screen IS because people know them or marvel wants them to know.With that said... this is the best MCU movie. 10/10. But i still think Spider-Man 2 and perhaps Into the Spider-Verse are far superior when it comes to standalone material. However you need to see Spider-Man 1 to understand Spider-Man 2. And you need to see the Sam Raimi trilogy to even understand some of the jokes in Spider-Verse. So then again... it is NOT fan-service. It's just what the movie is. By the people, for the people.This movie is amazing: exploring sides of Spider-Man never seen before and it kinda felt like a fever dream of how unreal the experience was. The last time i felt this way was with Infinity War. Not even Endgame get me so excited as this. Perhaps is just because Spider-Man is my favourite superhero. But being as objective as i possibly can: best superhero movie ever made within the MCU. A well deserved 10 stars. Thank you Steve Ditko and Stan Lee for the spider.", "better than endgame for me (:": "This film suprise me very very much tom hollad play his part very well but idk spider man tom holland acting like a little kid that the problem in spider man.", "Blockbuster!!": "It was a perfect combination of humour, emotions and action... Well done marvel... It also has the best post credit scene.... It is the best SpiderMan movie ever made...", "My name is shady": "I found this movie the best spider man movie I every watched and it was soo much hype and it was action and comedy and I hope they can make the next spider man movie more hyped.", "Spiderman was ok!": "I quite liked the movie and the cast afcourse, story is good, but humor is quite a disappointment! Nice one to watch, but not one to be glorified about!", "Oh wow": "Oh wow. What a film. This film perfectly blends action, humour, human and fan service. The fan service actually matters with the story too. Unlike Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker, which just slaps Lando Calrissian on as clickbait, this film actually wouldn't work without them, and definitely wouldn't be as good. The action is seriously brilliant. At one point, there is a fight on the Statue of Liberty. The action is really intense, and you feel that someone will die. Humour is perfectly crafted in with J. Jonah Jameson, who blames everything on Spider-Man, just likethe Sam Raimi trilogy and the comics. The human scenes are excellent too because someone important dies, I won't spoil who. The moment of reflection is so emotional. The ending is too, and if you compare this film to Venom, which is the also made by the same company (Sony/Marvel), it is like watching a romcom after watching horror film. Venom is pure comedy and (an attempt at) action, where as this is action and humour blended perfectly.", "Worth of watching the first day first show": "I watch it's first day first show, and this movie is worth of it.

Well because it literally has all the 3 spiderman well 4 if you include vemon and the old villain just makes the movie so nostalgic!!! Yeah the story was a little boring only the return of ild spidermans has builded up the movie.", "Where do I have to start...": "First of all the movie was an absolute masterpiece it's everything you'd want it to be. Everyone got perfect screen-time and I love how Andrew redeemed himself. The humor was hilarious and I love how they didn't add any humor in the emotional scenes. Willem Defoe did such a great job as green goblin same for the other villains. The movie was great and a perfect ending for the homecoming trilogy. This movie made me love Tom hollands Spider-Man even more. Super exited for the next trilogy.", "Fanservice doesn't make a good movie": "Lots of Easter eggs and fan service but if we take all apart there is little to no content on this spiderman, sad to say internet memes and reviews have exaggerated on the hype and reception of this movie.It's a good movie because all marvel movies are good but not near the quality of the writing and plotting of the rest.Problems:\nyour big idea for solving why a bad guy is bad is a potion, really?Why not go back and give thanos a tea?Btw dr strange spend a whole movie trying to perform a spell and that ned dude waves is hands and creates a multiverse portal directly to Spiderman's position by accident.It shows that they had to fit the big stars in and made lots of plot adjustments but to what point?Will rewatch and revaluate but on a first watching it is on a top 3 of the worst MCU films.", "Extraordinary and Breathtaking!": "This is such an amazing and breathtaking piece of cinematography. I loved every second of it and i'm definitely watching it all over again soon. Can't forget to mention the extraordinary cameos and parallels established with the previous spiderman movies, which truly enriched this piece of work.I just have to point out that, in my perspective, the movie's pacing in the beginning was a bit too fast, but a part from that, ITS PERFECT.I highly recommend it and i certainly hope you enjoy it as much as i did!", "THE BEST MCU MOVIE SO FAR": "Ok, there's a possibility that I'm wrong cause I'm still anesthetized by the hype after 4 hours since I've watched but who cares lol still a 10 star movie FOR SURE.It's everything you wanted to be AND MORE!", "Just a-ma-zing": "I am out of words to describe this title. If you are a fan of the three different spidermans prepare yourself. I watched it 12 hours ago and I am still in shock. Hope we keep on having this quality of movies, worth every dollar.", "We found out who Spiderman is": "The first impression of watching made me want to quote Barney Stinson from 'How I Met Your Mother' - it was legendary. Therefore, moving away from emotions, I want to clarify my feelings from viewing.It's no secret that Spider-Man is the most popular superhero and not only Marvel, but in general. In this regard, expectations from each of the films with his participation are simply off scale. It is always extremely difficult to live up to the expectations of skeptics, let alone fans ...Marvel and Sonya make a New Year's gift for everyone, and they do it in a beautiful manner. I met such a hero as Spiderman 20 years ago, but only now I am beginning to understand who he is. The film fits both high-quality action and personal drama. Powerful soundtracks, unexpected twists, ground for development, personal discovery - it's all here. Spider-Man films make us think that you are Peter Parker or not, it doesn't matter, anyone can be a hero. It doesn't matter if they know you by sight, if someone knows that you are a hero, just be them when you have to.Each genre has its own fan and its own hater. Surely everyone has heard from friends that they do not like superhero movies, just advise them to watch, once, then they will understand everything themselves. And if they don't want to, they don't even know what they are losing.This film is hopeful, enjoyable, more than just a superhero action movie. The Marvel Cinematic Universe, and in this case with the participation of Sonya, has turned into a powerful team that feels the desires of the audience and embodies them. Many childhood dreams are now on the screen and everyone can feel them. Movies are for viewers, viewers are for studios. And this balance has been caught, I would very much like it to be maintained as long as possible.High-quality cinema that exceeds all expectations, whether you love this genre or not, in any case, enjoy your viewing!", "Sopra le mie aspettative.": "Nonostante mi aspettassi un altra americanata firmata Marvel priva di ogni sentimento, mi sono dovuto ricredere.

Its everything you could ask for in a superhero film, Great acting, great action, character development, heart, and a meaningful message. Also seeing all the villains and Spider-Men from the earlier films was a fantastic treat. Each and every cast member killed it.

Explosive action with diverse range and kids of all ages rather enjoyed it, even middle age an older giggled at certain puns.", "Bloated, broken and full of plot holes": "** SPOILERS FOR NO WAY HOME **My take on No Way Home ( this is based on my first viewing, hoping that my opinion changes after the 2nd viewing, this is going to be long) :Finally, we got to witness the moments we've been dreaming to experience on the big screen after all these years. Literally everyone of us got our vocal cords damaged !!! Screams from fans bombarded our ear drums, what a massive celebration at the theatres for a marvel movie after endgame !!Coming to the point, I wanted to love this movie the way everyone's loving it right now, but sadly I didn't. I felt like they just wanted to make a fan-service movie involving Tobey and Andrew, along with Tom, and the whole movie plot is set up for this event to occur, it's bloated and broken and had multiple aims. I was disappointed with Jon Watts's direction ( tbh I really liked Homecoming and Far From Home was mediocre ) The background score is too weak for a big scale movie like this.THE VOIDS :I always wished to watch Tobey, Andrew, Tom together, but I also expected at least one rememberable standalone epic moment with all three of them together, at least one in the climax fight, like we had some in the previous movies like Thor's Wakanda Entry in Infinity War, Cap Vs. Thanos scene in endgame. I made this comparison because everywhere I go, i see people saying that it's better than endgame and infinity war.After coming out of the theatre, I don't even remember any such epic sequence in the pre final and final acts and it was way too simple, when you have 3 Spider-Men, when you can showcase amazing web slingshot sequences of all three of them together (something like TASM 2, SITSV), fighting/saving/save-fighting the sinister six (okay, sinister four ). A 3 Spider-Man mega fight was shot around a small scale statue structure, as if that's an easy way to shoot the climax battle, hiding the 'Tobey-Andrew' secret by not bringing them to the outdoors.Aunt May's death is way too dilute, something that's always present in MCU movies, they never let sad scenes to be sad scenes in movies, but they do handle such parts well in TV shows, for eg. WandaVision's ep 8, or What If's ep 4, where we literally felt the sadness the lead actor is going through. The impact of Uncle Ben's death on Peter was shown very well in Sam's Spiderman 1 and and TASM 1, but not Aunt May's death on Peter in NWH. Due to this, the scene where Peter punches Norman on the face in the climax got diluted.Another MCU formula, where a character that's overpowered for the current plot, gets sidelined for the whole movie and then returns in the climax ( eg. Captain Marvel in Endgame ) is implemented here too in the form of Dr. Strange. The sorcerer supreme, whom the ancient one claimed to be the best of the best, gets tricked by our neighborhood friendly Spider-Man and stays stuck in some dimension and we'll never see him again until the final battle. Strange doesn't even bother calling Wong for help all that time. MCU somehow finds a reason to get powerful characters sidelined until climax.I've noticed some illogical things too. How did the same J. J. Jameson from Tobey's universe ended up being in Tom's universe before Dr. Strange performed the spell ? I wonder how Tobey'd react if he sees him on TV in Tom's universe. Also if Ned was capable of opening portals and bringing Spider-Man, why did he stop doing that after calling just 2 Spideys, such a poor use of the multiverse concept. Come on, this movie was supposed to be the moment of our lives and if we've got 1 more (someone like Spider-Gwen, Spider-Ham, Miles Morales) and 1 more villian ( Vulture or Rhino ) to complete Sinister 6, that could've been a real surprise as Andrew-Tobey being in the movie was already an open secret.THE POSITIVES :All those villians were meh except Doc Ock and Goblin. Doc Ock's presence itself gave goosebumps and his mannerisms are straight fire. Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin is outstanding, what a legendary performance it is !!! I loved how Peter continued to follow his instincts to help the villians and cure them, upholding the Spider-Man spirit, anything otherwise would've made the film routine. The Dr. Strange Vs. Spider-Man sequence had amazing VFX, I loved the way it was shot.All in all, this movie finally defined Tom's Spider-Man. Tom's Spider-Man finally feels like Spider-Man and not like Ironman Jr. The interaction scenes between Tom, Tobey and Andrew are nostalgic. It had everything, the fun, the emotion, jaw dropping CGI and the best cinematography in Tom's home trilogy.My Rating : 2.75/5.", "Best spider-man movie": "Very good movie.. I enjoyed it very much...

By the end of this movie I wasn't feeling sad or happy, I had a feeling of awe about how this will change my life having watched it and also for future superhero movies in the future. It's a must recommended film and hope this has been helpful for you to see if you would like to watch the film.", "The best movie of 2021": "I think it's the best movie of Spider-Man it's the finally of the three trilogy's of Spiderman 10/10 the best movie of 2021, this movie need a Oscar and I live in Mexico and I see the premier and is the best.", "FULL OF LAYERS AND QUOTES": "It's a masterpiece from the first minutes to the end. The plot was well written and designed in order to review and connect details from the whole spider-verse. I've just watched it and I keep on trying to review and rewind the scenes and quotes in my mind. 'You're amazing!' Hahaha Loved it!", "100% pure Spidey experience": "Easily meets our expectations, and more! Simply the best Spider-Man movie, but possibly the best superhero movie ever! Must see, no doubt! Hell of an emotional rollercoster ride! I want a rerun NOW!", "*spoiler free* YOU NEED TO WATCH": "Not only did I cry I screamed ALOT and you will too this is spoiler free because I hope everyone experiences the serotonin this film gave me and not to mention the atmosphere the cinema had I wish I could experience it over and over again.", "The best Movie with best Fanfare": "Spiderman No Way Home is one of the, if not the best movie of all MCU till date, and can even challenge the Avengers Infinity War. The story is thrilling, and the movie is extremely well placed, but it still had the MCU charm in it. Emotion, Drama, Action, and most importantly infinity fanfare. This movie is a must watch.And please, don't leave your seats before the End Credit, or you r gonna miss a big one.", "Loved every second of the film and the biggest and greatest marvel MCU film": "I really loved watching this film. It really met our expectations and all the rumours were true. It is the biggest and greatest Marvel MCU Film more then avengers end game. The people in the cinema cheered a lot and even clapped. I will watch it again for sure because I really loved it.", "Superhit movie all spider man in the movie": "Best movie in the Marvel studios spider man no way home this awesome come back Sony and Marvel studios don't miss spider man no way home Tom Holland is very good actor and Andru such super come back for this movie in the spider man.", "Best movie after ENDGAME": "Aside from focusing on Peter Parker and the high school years more than its predecessors, the only thing that really makes him distinctive is that he isn't a standalone superhero, by which I mean he literally doesn't stand alone. He's Spider-Man in a world of wizards and fellow super people. He's the Spider-Man that's been to space and fought purple aliens armed with magic gloves. And without those team-ups and billionaire mentors, star cameos, and flashy tech, the MCU's Spidey, thus far, just hasn't been compelling enough to lead his own franchise. It's why the Spider-Man movies are easily the most underwhelming of the MCU's solo hero stories. And in No Way Home, once again, we need characters from other universes to show up for things to get exciting. It's also why the best Tom Holland Spider-Man movies have been ones in which he pops in supporting role, for instance, his electric introduction in Captain America: Civil War and his key contribution as the beating heart of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame.", "Great Story": "Loved how they incorporated the multi-verse. Action-packed with all of my favorite Marvel Villains and Heroes. I would have loved to see them do the Spider Man meme where they are pointing at each other, but we can't have it all.

I mean SO well.Not a single Marvel fan alive will be disappointed by this.", "Best move you'll ever watch!": "One of the best cinematic experiences ever. A film with a bunch of twists and action-filled drama. Definitely a must-watch! Loved it! Amazing! The directors and producers have created a master-piece!", "The best Spidey adaptation ever!": "I think #NoWayHome is the best Spiderman movie adaptation ever made. I can't describe how many different ways it makes me feel, and how full each emotion is.From the script to the VFX everything is perfect.Please go and watch. Belive me, you wouldn't forgive yourself if you miss this EPIC movie.", "Spiderman Blockbuster": "Mind Blowing abba.....Marvel Movie History lo Number 1 movie.....It will create Records. The Making of this film is Completely Amazing.... Its beyond the expectations of the Audience... Rocked it.", "balanced": "The movie starts with the mess that followed after the events of it's prequel , and with a brisk pace the characters start to join in , and finally with a bit of luck we finally get the spider man trilogy all together , and it all ends with a nice fight sequence . It finally had everything that a spider man movie should have , sacrifice , loss and the famous quote with great power comes great responsibility .The best movie yet the the trilogy.", "Spidy master piece": "One of the best spider man movies till now.never enjoyed this much after watching any spider man movie,my throat was totally got pain after coming out of theatre.Finally what i want to say is,\nAfter watching spider man - no way home i totally forgot the way to go home, i mean that much impact the movie showed on me.thanks to the team of spider man no way home for giving this masterpiece.", "Just a masterpiece": "I loved every second of this movie.

BUT the BEST film that I personally have EVER seen in my lifetime. I found myself subconsciously clapping and just screaming inside with joy. The returns of some characters are incredible. The film balances the comedy with a dark/sad plot to follow. Tom Hollands spider-man in a film so crowded still manages to shine and outdoes himself with his performance. This feels like a true spider-man movie especially in the very last scene. His performance is incredible and some of the action sequences are beautiful with moves taken from the game. This feels like the most badass, realistic and cool portrayal of a spider-man yet. It maintains comic accuracy and tom's suits are beautiful. Some scenes are absolutely heart wrenching, i found myself crying numerous times. This film is a masterpiece and a love letter to all marvel or spiderman fans and a work of art. It avoids the other spider-man movies mistakes and just gives characters such realistic convincing arcs. A true work of art, round of applause for John Watts and Tom Holland. This movie is fan service central and i'm here for it.", "best spider man movie": "I've cried screamed laughed, it's truly an amazing movie and definitely one of the best works marvel and sony have made if not the best!The atmosphere at the theater was something else, everyone was yelling and clapping it was wonderful and it is absolutely an experience that i will never forget.", "Awesome Movie": "Just great. What can I say, It's just too good to be true. Got Everything I wanted from the movie and much more and I can surely say that this is one of the best movies of the year and of the MCU.", "SIMPLY AMAZING": "BEST SPIDEY FILM!!! Brought back so many memories and easily the best Spider-Man if not marvel thing they have ever produced ! Will love to see how marvel branch off from this production.", "Ridiculous": "This movie is....epic. This movie was phenomenal. Great acting, awesome villains. And marvel knocks it out of the park as usual. I highly recommend you go see this movie more than once. The post credit scenes are great as well.", "Good God!": "It seems like marvel makes their characters learn from their mistakes except for the romance. I really don't need to write anything because it's so perfectly made. I love that even without Stan Lee, mcu is still the best and possibly unbeatable.", "Best gift ever to all spidey fan around the globe": "This movie is like a dream for any spider-man fan, it contains all the elements(emotions, comedy and action) you wanna see in a movie. This was the second movie after ENDGAME I was this much excited for, and it exceeds my expectations.", "Spider-man: Endgame": "In the film, whole lot of human emotions are shown in an beautiful way. Emotions like love, sadness, pain, brutal rage from betrayal are exceptionally outstanding. While watching the last scene(I shall not reveal the scene, of course, no spoilers :) ), I must confess I felt my heart ripped away. Personally, I think it is the best spiderman film hitherto.I, being a doctor strange fan, felt a little disappointed. Because, It was shown like he was being a little impatient through out the film rather than being a mentor to a person who is in a lot of emotional trouble.Nevertheless, the second half of the film is outstanding. I felt hair standing on my hands in every action scene.Mid credit scene leaves a very fine plot for the next spiderman films and post credit scenes is more than masterpiece. You'll love it!!On a final note, the film was amazing!! Watch the film in 3d...u will enjoy it definitely.", "A movie that match every possible expectations.": "Remember, when End Game was released there was a saying, \"this is the movie made by the fan for the fan\". Well the saying goes for Spiderman: No Way Home too.Just watched the film and it was very much enjoyable and amazing. There are a lot of Surprises and many other things. This might be the best live action Spiderman movie ever.", "It's fest day for all spidy fan... Big appreciation for Sony and Marvel": "Woke up early morning.. took bath and travelled 50km in foggy winter just because of movie.. and it's totally worthy. Really appreciated and a big thank you marvel for understanding fan. Please don't judge the infinity war or end game. Those were totally different approach and this is just a beginning to a different universe.. it's a perfect movie for a fan..non fan too..whatever conversations we have done with our friends they just did.. awesome..amazing .. ultimate... spectacular ....love this...After Spider-Man into the spiderverse..", "Damn": "If you are marvel fan must watch this movie on threater...this movie is lit\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25action, animation, emotion every thing is on next level.i just finished this movie and i come to give riview.", "top tier movie": "If you think that this movie.is a mindless cash grab,it's really not. This movie has the heart that was visible in the raimi films and in into the spiderverse. Obviously tobey and andrew were in the movie,and they seem to effortlessly fit right back into their roles as spiderman,showcasing why we loved them in the first place. Tobey and andrew's acting is top-tier,showing that they still got it. Charlie cox is as good as he was in daredevil(2015),even though we only get like a minute or so with him.Initally,i was afraid that this movie would be like spiderman 3,overly stuffed with characters and no proper development. But i was proven wrong and never more happy. Molina,Dafoe,Foxx bring their A-game to their roles,as though they never stopped playing the characters. The chemistry between tobey,andrew and tom is dynamic and funny. This movie also truly captures the character of spiderman. Don't miss it.", "It will be a Non spoiler review": "It was an epic movie as a die hard marvel fan i will give it 10/10 in every manner it was perfect. How every thing was taking place for a marvel movie it was first time that marvel studios made it so dark and Doctor Strange Multiverse of Madness will be more darker so whoever will watch this movie can understand that how good marvel took the concept of Dark it full of emotions at one moment i literally cried. It was one of the best marvel movies i had ever watched.", "The. Best.": "Finished watching this, and it was amazing. I was afraid that it might've been too overhyped, although after watching it, that \"overhype\" from before isn't even close to how amazing this film truly was. The cinematography of this film was beautiful, the characters were amazing, the fight, the plot, the perfect amount of humour and the perfect amount of sadness, it left the whole audience screaming from excitement. Can proudly say this is definitely the best MCU film, and one of the best films I have personally seen.", "Phenomenal movie": "No other cinema experience will ever compare to this. Enjoyed every second of spider man no way home. Absolutely hands down best experience ever. My eyes were fixated on the screen the whole time.", "The most hyped movie ever delivers to expectations.": "I don't want to spoil the movie. This movie makes Tom Holland the Spider-Man. I can't speak much without spoiling, but the movie is really exciting. The final battle is so grand and satisfying. The future of Spider-Man is very promising and he can now be the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.", "Just for Tobey and Andrew": "I don't like Tom Holland as Spiderman. The only thing I liked in the movie was seeing the old actors again. Tobey and Andrew are at the forefront of these. These two names made me watch the movie.", "Spider-man": "This movie is totally amazing. The script, visual effects and actors are the best! I really enjoyed it yesterday!In my opinion, even knowing some things that would happen, I really was impressed by this movie, it was so much better than I expected!We laughed, we cried, we were excited, we were shocked. A lot of different emotions in one movie.", "Amazing movie all of time": "Okay, this film was amzing all of the time, there was acrion, drama, laught. When l was watching that movie in theatre, l am freaked out. Aslo the movie was 3d, and this thing was beatiful. But i wrote rating 9. Maybe you wonder? I less one point because story was little bit pontless, noting happend in earf, but doctor strange's spell qas wrong and thatswhy starting uncertainty in earf, changed time, so everything was badly.", "An incredible, exhilarating, heartbreaking, heartwarming, action-packed journey": "The entire movie had me on the edge of my seat, and everything about it was exciting from the get go. From the beginning, i knew this would be a new kind of superhero movie.There is unexpected tragedy in this film, as well as a shocking ending...\nThe symbolism of the homemade suit at the end finally showed Spider-Man was truly a solo, true hero.Would give a ten, but the use of a Sinister 5 instead of Sinister 6 kinda disappointed me. Nevertheless, I love this movie, and it may just be my new favorite Spidey Flick (i need to rewatch Homecoming - Yes i think it is (slightly) better than Spider-Man 2 dont @ me)", "It's an experience": "This is the greatest Spider-Man movie ever made. Tom Holland stole the spotlight with his performance. His acting was too great. At end of the film I had a roller coaster of emotions. It was a bit nostalgic. But the MCU factor in this movies has worked out very. The VFX and CGI illustration are great. If you are a spider man fan it's purpose to watch the film. If you're some one who haven't watched any Marvel movies it may little difficult to get but the story line is simple to understand about multiverse and you can enjoy the film with pleasure.", "Epiccccccc": "Epic is the word to be used\nIt was a feast watching this film in India's largest screen v-epic. Extraordinary graphics and visual effects.Best Marvel film ever.", "Greatest movie in 2021": "The film contains a lot of great feelings and sad feelings sometimes and old school of comedy and awesome CGI and beautiful scenes of action but there is a little bit of hard understanding thing.At the end I recommend that movie to you specially who +20 years.", "Spider-Man: No Way Home. A film that is second to none": "With this title, Jon Watts created a great and spectacular film. It is full of allusions and Easter eggs to the other Marvel Cinematic Universe films and the previous Spider-Man films. High performance of music, images, sound and acting makes the third part of the Tom Holland series one of the best and most impressive films from Marvel. The numerous \"new\" heroes and villains do not let the story overload and even with no prior knowledge from the last Spider-Mans, you can keep track of things. The feelings are not neglected either. On the contrary, they are always shown differently in the course of the scenes, which, not least because of the actors' incredible acting skills, seems real and casts a spell over the audience. So the film is sad, you have to have your handkerchiefs ready once or twice in between, but at the same time, you have to add lots of funny and joking sections. Just Marvel. All in all, you can say about \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" that superhero films have been raised to a whole new level and that a starting point has been laid for future parts. Now, this level has to be maintained or even increased for the next Spider-Man. And you have to do that first.", "Best film of the year": "Spider-mens good looking together they are realy strong.

Well done tom i proud of you.", "A perfect way to end a trilogy": "Tom holland shines bright in this movie and the plot alongside with him. This movie has fan service but isn't driven by that. Everything this movie sets up by the end will make you have an experience you've never had before!", "Disappointing Peter Parker": "It kills off Spiderman's family and support system all because Peter Parker can't handle the fame of being an Avenger. Yes the movie had a lot of great gimmicks but they all ultimately add up to the destruction of the Spiderman infrastructure leaving Spiderman cut off from the rest of the Marvel universe. What a brat.", "You will not be disappointed!": "This movie was absolutely incredible. Tom Holland has really grown into the role of spider-man and Peter Parker. The fighting sequences, the intensity of the movie and the non-stop gripping action made the film superb. Quite possibly the best marvel movie i've ever seen!", "Gratest One from Tom Holland's Spider Man": "This movie is just a master piece, i mean the story is soo good that i just got tear when Aunt May died. This movie was different from the last two, as the last two was more on a sarcastic side but this one is more on dark and emotional side. This movie still maintain the sent of the comedic background of spider man and one of the funniest scean was when Ned calls peter and all three peter says yes and then Ned says parker and they all reply like we all the peter parker.", "Marvellous": "Just Incredible.Best spider man movie so far.

Once we get over that, then it's interesting. The earlier spiderman movies are smoother. Also, the emotional, or deep thinking parts of the movie is slow and drags. Better editing and faster pace there would have been good.", "8.5 - It's the best spider-man movie of MCU but It has its defcects": "I don't want to tell you the part you already know: the film is very funny to watch, emotional, nostalgic and it has some badass fights.But when you have concepts like multiverse and different timelines, you must explain it somehow a few questions: why that thing happened? What will happen on that universe and timeline because you changed things?And the film is lazy in explore that part. (I understand why... because they want to sell an easy understandable film for every person, but I still believe they could have done better on that).I really enjoyed the end of the film and what we can expect of the future of Spider-Man. Don't disappoint us Sony.", "What an amazing movie, I feel blessed to be the fan of spider man.": "I really admire the whole crew members and cast members hard work to make this movie perfect.

Met and exceeded every expectation I had of this movie. Marvel and Sony have done the most unbelievable job!", "MY PERSONAL FAVORITE": "Just watch it, it's my personal favorite marvel movie from the decade.Very exciting, great visual effects, great acting. Perfect balance of humorous and dramatic events, will make you gag for sure. I was a little worried if marvel would be able to keep up the quality after endgame, but they really outdone themselves. Keep'em coming!", "Best spider man movie ever made": "Words can't describe how much joy and fun i had watching this masterpiece really entertaining I really enjoyed it every thing was awesome from fighting scenes to dialogues it's just too good.", "THE MOST STUPENDOUS AND ADMIRABLE": "First day first show- as always for Spider-man. Spider-man: No way home was an amazing, interesting and a captivating movie with an amazing plot twist. John Watts has done a brilliant job in directing this movie. Furthermore, there was a lot of adventure, sci-fi, team-work, friendship, love and emotions in the movie. In fact this movie met beyond my expectations, more than what I had expected, yet that's why it's such a brilliant movie. In comparison to Tom Holland's other Spider-Man movies, this had to be the most emotional and the most engaging. The friendship between Peter Parker(Tom Holland), MJ(Zendaya) and Ned(Jacob Batalon) was very deep and they were always there for each other like always.Doctor Strange(Benedict Cumberbatch) has also done a great job along with the villains: Doctor Otto Octavius(Alfred Molina), Norman Osborn(Norman Osborn), Sandman(Thomas Haden Church), Electro(Jamie Foxx) and Lizard(Rhys Ifans).In Conclusion, this movie was the best and had to be the most incredible without a doubt.", "Fun, emotional, brilliant!!!": "Wow, No Way Home had everything I want from a superhero movie, and more.It had jokes, tears, nostalgia, comic book accuracy, and most importantly a fun, action packed movie!The amount of 'goosebumps' moments in the movie grow and grow as you delve further into this Marvel/Sony masterclass.All real fans knew that Maguire and Garfield would be in it, and the anticipation and excitement for this was perfectly matched in the movie, as all 3 Spider-Men worked together very well on screen.The ending is creative, and leaves you wanting more, and wondering what is next for our wall crawling hero.I certainly cannot wait to see what's next....", "A Masterclass in filmmaking.": "This is one of the most stellar and striking movies of all time. It is now my personal favorite. So much passion and care went into the screenplay, the characters, the STAKES. This movie will leave you feeling in awe, and I cannot wait to see the future of this series, and of Tom Holland's Spider-Man. Iron Boy Jr. No more.", "Spider-Man Brings it Home": "This is non-spoiler so no worries, this film is a masterpiece. It would've been hard to believe anything could ever live up to Infinity War and Endgame, but No Way Home manages to deliver every single drop of hype to the max, and has moments exceeding anything I ever imagined. This is a masterclass of a film and a beautifully clear way to introduce moviegoers into the bigger multiverse the MCU has been edging towards.I honestly enjoyed this movie so much I had a grin plastered from cheek to cheek for every second. I recommend everyone - even if you aren't a massive fan of these films - to give this one a watch.", "No spoilers.": "One of the best Spider-Man movie I have ever seen. Loved it . At first I didn't liked Tom holland.and I really hate him.But now he is one of my favourite Spider-Man . Really enjoyed to see him as a powerful performance in Spider-Man no way home.", "Cried the entire time": "Cried for both the sad and happy parts. It was really beautiful and sweet and amazing and funny, too. It was the best and is everything you could love about a spiderman movie.", "Everything it needed to be and more...": "I can't overstate my love for Spider-Man. This character shaped my childhood, and in many ways, has made me the person I am today. I watched every Spider-Man cartoon growing up. I counted down the days to the theatrical release of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3, the first of the three Raimi films I was old enough to see in theaters at the time of its release. My friends and I waited impatiently for the day we would all go to see Mark Webb's adaption together on the big screen, a gritty reimagination of the beloved character. I remember first getting into the comics after craving more from this universe, which was when I first discovered how much more there was to this character than I had previously realized. Even in adulthood, I frequently revisit these films and find something new to appreciate with every viewing. Spider-Man changed me.Ever since the Raimi and Webb series were canceled prematurely, I have practically been begging for a resolution to what I view to be unfinished work. No Way Home is exactly that... a beautiful and heartfelt continuation of a world that is dear to me. Loose ends were tied in way that kept everyone true to their characters, and in many cases, further developed those characters in ways that felt like natural and warranted progressions of where they left off. Even the character designs and costume choices showed a drive to please fans by progressing both the characters and the story in ways we have been waiting to see for years. Alfred Molina's portrayal of Doc Oc will have the theater cheering and Willem Dafoe's performance as The Green Goblin might have possibly been the highlight of the movie for me. Because I aim to keep this review spoiler free, I will leave it at that.There are some minor critiques I could offer in relation to some of the acting, voiceovers, and animation, but at the end of the day, that's not what makes or breaks this kind of film. The people who are looking forward to this movie will walk out grinning, and that's what's important. This movie brings together all of these missing pieces and lost opportunities to create something truly unique and sentimental. It invokes nostalgia in a way that feels earned. It's a film marketed towards die-hard fans of the character Spider-Man, and what I watched tonight was fan-service at its absolute best. No Way Home is everything it needed to be and more.", "Spiderman shouldn't stubborn": "From the above topic, how did it come about? Let me clarify a bit ,The following will be spoilers. People who haven't seen this movie I suggest\nDo not read it. This movie has many advantages. The part that makes me surprise But sometimes the surprise It should not come out in a way that it shouldn't be cause. Spoilers : The scene where Spider-Man asks Doctor Strange for help. It should be a scene where Peter It shouldn't interfere with Doctor Strange concentration It should leave the doctor doubts , Peter shouldn't to tell the doctor that that person can't erase the memory,\nThis person should not delete ,This person too , Instead of finishing this discussion before the doctor casts the spell. This is what I see as it doesn't make sense. It's a good idea to use old villain in this movie that's surprise\nBut looking back, this surprise Does it cause any trouble? And who made this trouble happen? Of course! Peter make this surprise! I don't understand why he so stubborn cause the final result is It ended the first way Doctor Strange\nhave said it before, what peter did it's not for people not for himself but for tiring the energy of superhero should to use for the criminal on world not another universe, It was caused by Peter's innocence to make people hurt and diedWhat peter did it has no meaning. Peter's heroism in this season is 0/100.It remains only Weakness. Sympathize with things that should not be sympathetic, he didn't think carefully so this situation aunt may is dead and Michelle Jones-Watson is almost dead. I'm not saying Spider-Man isn't fun. I'm so excited\nwith seeing the 3 Spider-Man meet. But it just doesn't make sense for what Peter does It shouldn't have ended like this And it should even work out fine.", "Best Spider-Man movie I have ever seen": "Right off the bat I just want to say, I don't usually write reviews on IMDB but this one hit my feelings and emotions throughout. The whole idea of this movie where they tamper with the temporal contiuum and breaking the natural law, as we saw doctor strange almost did in his movie reflects to all THIS! It brought back villains from other universes OF WHAT WE KNOW from Raimi's and Webb's universe. I mean the whole theater went buzerk when Nedd casted the spell and as BOTH Tobey and Andrew came in I mean I got emotional. This review is getting long but, all I'm trying to say is that this movie has to be hands down one of the best spiderman movies I have seen A MUST WATCH IF YOU'RE A HUGE SPIDER MAN AND MCU FAN.

The plot is superb with some nice twists along the line (NO SPOILERS), and the acting is just great.I love how they slot in little bits of humour along with the action which makes it a very easy-to-watch film as its not purely action.. not to mention the great morals it tries to instil in the viewers like doing the right thing even when it seems like there's an easy option out to not doing that!

I loved how they developed Tom's character to what we can finally call him 'Spider-Man'.No need to write a whole paragraph as we all know it's spectacular in every way, but I'm sure a lot of people can agree with me on wanting to see more of Tobey and Andrew as they are loved soo much (really enjoyed and loved Andrew Spider-Man in this compared to his previous movies, and of course Tobey stole the show as usual). Would have been amazing if Tobey came through strange's portal in an intense and heart pumping scene with the Sam Rami theme tune flowing through, coming in clutch.I really loved the end act of the movie where Peter is a stranger to everyone, no MJ, no Ned, no aunt May, no Happy, no Mr Stark, completely alone...... The whole interaction with MJ and Ned in the caf\u00e9 just displays all the emotions of his new life, his new struggle. Him moving to a shabby flat and the new homemade suit where perfect.All-in all it is a masterpiece, just a few nit-picks but nothing major.

I've been a spiderman fan since i was little so i am a little biased. This is my favorite marvel movie hands down, probably one of my fav movies of all time.Starts out a little slow.

(All puns intended)": "This will be a non- spoiler review so feel free to read it all.Experience: The cinema was cheering and howling from the very beginning, I had a similar reaction. The number of people in the cinema was about 70-75 or more than that. The cinema's response on every scene was fantastic, everybody was weeping and crying and laughing and hooping and what not. As expected. Throughout the movie I laughed, I cried, sometimes both, and my tears blended, my face whole wet with tears. Even when the credits were rolling I wasn't sitting there with that heart pulse, I was impressed and just lost and in awe of how good this movie was.Summary: This movie felt like an authentic Spiderman movie, it was funny, exciting, action-packed. It takes its time, It feels like a pure Spiderman with the themes. It chooses to explore the stakes and the consequences from beginning to end. It does have that Endgame quality where you're like \"Wow, they are doing something big\" It rectifies the previous Tom Holland movies with confidence. And with hard decision-making. This, to me, felt like the most authentic Spiderman/Peter Parker movie I've seen in a long time.Tom Holland's Performance: This is easily Tom's best performance. He is freaking fantastic in this movie, he's incredible.What to expect: This is a Spiderman movie that will give you certain things that you want and also some things that are challenging and that hurt. Whether that be in emotional aspect or even in action. In a way, I don't know if it's only me but some action scenes felt more like violence than action in some cases. I was swept up in this.Plot: It was darker than the trailers led on, It's way more emotional. I'm in awe of how I got much more than I expected, it's full of surprises from beginning to end. Even after hearing certain things on how they will go plot-wise. Watching the execution was much more surprising in that regard..\nExecution: As a huge Spiderman fan, It went through every single issue I've had with Spiderman in comics or even in general. I've read some Spiderman comics too. The movie did it in a way that felt smooth and plotted out in a way that it feels that Its plot and story and drama are written over the last 10 years. It gave me Spiderman that felt so true to its character and it felt like it fits with what we've had with Tom Holland.Visuals: INCREDIBLE visuals, the way they executed it, throughout the number of beautiful visuals and even in the fight scenes, its something spectacular. Puns intended.Direction: John Watson's direction in this is fire. He learned style. There is tension throughout this movie, there's emotion, there's beautiful scene work, the visuals, everything about this is fantastic chef kiss.The Score: Incredible score, soundtracks, the composition, full of emotions and bad-ass music. Overall incredible.Sinister Six: I personally think Green Goblin Is the best in this movie, absolutely fantastic. He was better in this movie than he was in the first movie. He's so menacing, so insidious, and overall such a great performance. The movie establishes the character better than I've ever seen in the live-action. With lizard and sandman, it felt two-dimensional, they lost some three-dimensional stuff that you would hope for. They still kept the three-dimensional stuff with Electro and Doc Ock. But the one that stood out the most was Green Goblin. They make specific and certain choices they make with Sandman and Lizard that I wasn't too fond of, can't go into details as to why. There were certain parts where I was like \"I don't know why they chose to do it like that but okay\". But overall all of them were enjoyable to watch, and a nostalgic trip back to the 2000's.Rating: This is easily the best Spiderman movie I've seen after Tobey's Spiderman trilogy and Andrew's TASM 1 and 2. A solid 9.5/10 from me.", "Nostalgic, emotional and really clever movie": "You can't ask for a better spider-man movie.I enjoyed it a lot, the actors are amazing they are very talented.Marvel just knows their stuff, the story is just breathtaking.", "Recommendation for view": "I have not seen more perfect flashbacks, the film recalls other spiders and their pain, they tell the new Peter Parker that you cannot listen to the feeling of hatred that lurked in him after the death of Aunt May. The film is overflowing with flashbacks and morality. I recommend watching all the past spider movies.", "One of the best MCU movies": "Great acting from everyone, especially Willem Dafoe. The story was extremely good, as it manages to be both lighthearted and heartbreaking. Especially Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield added more dynamic to the movie in general as they were great supporting charachters. Through them we had a realistic character growth from Toms Spider-Man. The ending was in my opinion quite well done, as it shows what consequences there are when meddeling with the multiverse. All action-scenes were great and perfectly showed each spider-mans relationship with the corrisponding villain. Only thing I thought was missing was eventually a villain from the MCU timeline, but they still managed to make a great movie without a vulture or maybe Mysterio or any other pre-existing MCU villain.", "It's a good maybe better than endgame": "Cool movie. When Tobey and Andrew shows I screamed. Such a good movie.mijfjTouch and hold a clip to pin it. Unpinned clips will be deleted after 1 hour.

Looked more realistic in Spider-man 2 nearly 20 years ago), and oh God, the cars that are smashed in the bridge fight are so awfully rendered that the PS4 Spider-man game looks way better. Yeah, it had many great characters, yeah it had many great heroes and villains from the other movies, but still... I left the movie so disappointed!!! It really felt that Marvel and Sony wanted to copy everything that worked in all the other Spider-man movies and Avengers and throw everything in a single 2:30 movie, the result is that no single character is developed in this movie! Yes, I watched every other single movie but I really couldn't care less about any character this time, because each character screen time was completely insignificant. Not to mention the scene in which Ned brings the two spidey's to help, oh God, what a mediocre and absolutely ridiculous scene!!!

The best thing I've experienced this year and I haven't been to a movie theater since IT 2 came out in 2019 I believe. The actors really did their thing especially Tom Holland this is the best role I've seen him as Spider-Man. It felt like no one outshined him in this film and for the most part the film made sense and didn't feel forced , rushed , or cringey. It was absolutely perfect and this film brought a nostalgic feeling bringing me back to childhood which had me feeling so good inside. The crowd was amazing felt like before Covid times. At my movie theater I went to the they had motion seats where your seats move during action scenes which had me enjoying it even more. Also half of my tickets were free because someone's friend never showed up so he left the free tickets at the consession stand. My favorite scenes were SPOILERS when Tom Holland's spider sense was tingling and he knew Goblin was about to attack , the fight scene between Tom Spider-Man and doctor strange, seeing goblin and all the other villains, Jaime fox joke about there being a black spider man out there , the fight scene at the end, when the Spider-Men from my favorite Toby McGuire universe and the other Spider-Man universe came together, when the second Spider-Man saved Mj, I just loved it all really love how Spider-Man had to make sacrifices in this film and how he matured into a grown man in this film. I loved the action scenes and i felt Aunt Mays death was realistic and i felt sad for her and really felt the emotion from Tom in this scene. I really feel Stan Lee would've been proud please go see the movie it was so worth going to the theater and watching it's a special film. I'm excited for the next Marvel multiverse phases and possible next Spider-Man film after seeing Eddie Brock /venom in the credits scene. I can't wait to see the new doctor strange and Thor films also. Thank you marvel ! I loved all the actors in this film they did wonderful. 5 stars and not to mention my children loved it also. A must see !!! \ud83d\udd77\ud83d\udd78", "The culmination of this generation": "The first movie I remember watching was Spiderman. It came out when I was 2, and I've watched it at least a hundred times. I would watch it with my cousins and alone and loved every second of it. Spiderman 2 was incredible, and I watched it just as much as the first. When spiderman 3 came out I begged my parents to take me to see it, and even though I knew it wasn't great in that young kid way of knowing a movies bad, I still loved it, it was spiderman! The first time we got to see venom!The amazing spiderman 1 and 2 were with me through my middle school years. I saw it with my best friends, my first girlfriend, my family. We couldn't stop talking about them everyone else would get sick of it.Then the civil war trailer dropped, and spiderman was finally going to meet the Avengers. We got to see spiderman fight with a team, the Iron spider suit, mysterio, his relationship with Tony Stark everything.All of that led to here. Seeing the faces of each stage of my life together, swinging across the statue of liberty trying to save the villains that I had mourned already, wishing they could be saved. It was perfect and even more than I hoped for.I know I'm biased I accept that. But this movie was made for me, and people just like me, so I don't care.

While I like MCU a lot, it is usually sort of a junk food for me. You enjoy it, but it doesn't leave lasting impressions. Sometimes though, sometimes MCU manages to knock it out of the park so well that I cannot help but sing endless praises to them.This movie should not work, trailers made it feel like it will ride on fanservice only with too much going on in it. While Jon Watts made two fun Spidey movies, I could not have possibly imagined him handling such a massive movie with such delicate touch. I was very surprised to get a genuinely endearing story that uses fanservice with utmost brilliance.The performances were all incredible, especially Holland. The action was very fun and sometimes even quite brutal. The cinematography is beautiful, despite the usual bland MCU lighting. It's just a really good movie overall.Hats off to everyone who worked on this wonderful picture. If previous two Spider-Man movies were light-hearted stories detailing Spidey's teen life, this is the culmination of all of his journey and his passage to adulthood. Spider-Man was always a hero defined by his relatable struggles, his genuinely kind heart and obviously - responsibility. Despite all the crazy shenanigans, movie somehow manages to still convey these grounded emotional themes really well. The fanservice is used to actually advance these themes, not distract from them.Sure, there are some technical that some folk will cling onto, but I don't care.

Fascinating plot, Applaudable performances (Tom Holland's best till date) The re-emergence of all our childhood villains and an Engaging Screenplay to keep the viewers hooked is quite simply the kinda Superhero movie we all deserved !But the biggest pluses in my opinion is the fact that movie works upon on how to give the buddies a nudge in the right direction which is unlike any superhero movies you'll ever see. Regardless how hard it is, Everyone deserves a second chance and that for me is the icing on the top of the cake.Lastly it's a film for the fans from a fan.And Director Jon Watts seemed to have realized this and deliver this once In a life masterpiece.Go, get yourself immersed in the feeling of how all the superhero movies should be made.

Written beautifully and acted out so great I can't even describe it. The idea of a sad ending is great and actually not expected. Many plot twists and things to enjoy in this movie, especially for die hard Spider-man fans.", "A Vicious Assault on Prior Character Development (and our intelligence)": "After seeing so many people rave about it, and of course my love of the other MCU films, I couldn't wait to see Spider-Man: No Way Home. I wanted to love it, I really did, but there were just too many disappointing factors and gaping plot holes.1. Spider-Man's identity is revealed and half the population believes he's a Mysterio-murdering villain, conveniently forgetting that he's an Avenger who gave his life trying to save the universe. Even if not many people know this, somehow no one from his team comes forward to vouch for him and clear up the misunderstanding. I'm pretty sure most people worship the other Avengers (Thor, Hulk, War Machine, Falcon, Hawkeye...) and would believe them over Mysterio. I just found his whole 'predicament' artificially complex when it was easily solvable or at least improvable. Even if you argue that maybe not everyone would believe them, and Peter would still have haters, the fact that this wasn't even attempted and the testimony of the Avengers means nothing, doesn't make any sense at all. The only witness he brought up was Fury, who was conveniently off-planet.2. When Peter goes to Strange for help, Strange initially denies his request (a. Because it's reckless, and b. Because it's not possible anyway without the stone), but then with very little convincing he obliges via a universal memory-altering spell. This is completely out of line with Strange's character throughout the other films. In Infinity War, he told Stark he wouldn't hesitate to let both him & Peter DIE over the stone, because the \"universe depends on it.\" So he's not willing to risk the stability of the universe to protect Peter's 'actual' life. But he's willing to risk the stability of the universe to protect Peter's 'social' life? WTF.3. Even if we grant that #2 is plausible and that Strange would make this moronic decision, he would not have begun the spell without making sure Peter fully understood the consequences. Naturally, this would include reviewing the fact that he, himself, would no longer know who Peter really is, and wouldn't be able to help him if something went wrong. If it was 'possible' to cast the spell in a way that allows those closest to him (Aunt May, Happy, MJ, Ned, the Avengers) to still know Spider-Man's identity, that is what Strange should have - and realistically would have - suggested and ultimately done to begin with. I don't buy that he would immediately go all Hocus Pocus without discussing anything whatsoever, and then screw it up mid-cast. Add to that the fact that this all-powerful & wise wizard allowed a teenager to distract him & disrupt the universe-altering spell, multiple times, and it makes even less sense.4. Aunt May convincing Peter to help the villains rather than send them back seemed painfully contrived. Given all that she's already witnessed and what can happen when you eff with the universe (the blip, etc.) she suddenly cares more about these strangers than the safety of her own \"son.\" Her lines throughout the film just made no sense and were forced to further the plot. \"This is what we do.\" 'What' is what we do? Betray our friends and risk the very fabric of the universe to play mad-scientist with strange murderers we just met?5. Even more forced than this is Peter's decision to defy Dr. Strange. Yes, he's a rebellious teenager, but he respected Stark as a mentor and tended to regret his own recklessness whenever s-t got too real (nearly drowning everyone on the ferry). S-t had gotten VERY real by this point, with multiple villains leaking into his universe, nearly killing everyone on that bridge, yet he not only defied, but FOUGHT his die-hard ally and friend, and abandoned him in the mirror dimension... all to execute his own elementary plan to \"save\" these total strangers who tried to murder him (and others). I view this almost as Peter fighting Stark over the suit he gave him. It would never happen. Stark asked for it back, and that was it. There was no argument. So his decision to rebel here made no sense and cheapened the gravity of what Peter/Strange went through together in the other films, and the sanctity of their bond. (The Civil War rivalry between Cap & Stark realistically 'tested' their bond and took 2+ hours of story to unravel it. It didn't pretend their bond was paper thin or that there was no bond to begin with.) No Way Home betrays the Strange/Peter bond in MINUTES of rash decision-making, and then further insults our intelligence by expecting us to believe that Spider-Man could actually defeat him and trap him in the mirror dimension. Sure, Strange was pulling his punches, but I still feel this would have been a piece of cake for Strange; he's a f-ing magic-wielding, universe-altering WIZARD. Stahp it. Toward the end, the very sky is cracking apart and Strange is holding it together single-handedly, but we're to believe he couldn't take a box away from Peter. Ok.6. Obviously Strange would have been instrumental in helping Spider-Man wax those villains; they would've been no match for him, so I found it convenient that he was trapped the entire movie and couldn't help. It just seems like small potatoes compared to what Peter has already been through. He fought Thanos hand-to-hand and then disappeared for 5 years, came back and helped save the universe by playing keep-away with a magic glove, parkouring through an entire army of aliens. Now he arrogantly traps the Wizard who helped him do it, and gets his @$$ beat by basic villains who, even combined, are 100x less of a threat than gauntlet-wearing Thanos. Stark is rolling in his grave.7. Why didn't Peter try to figure out the cure while the villains were safely in their cells? At the VERY least he could have released them one-at-a-time to work on it. Why all at the same time???8. He basically traded Aunt May's life to save a bunch of villains he didn't even know from Adam. You could argue he didn't know she would die, but clearly he was willing to risk it. I don't buy that. Several of them already tried killing him, yet he chose them over Strange and then LET THEM OUT, no questions asked, to have a slumber party at Happy's place. The other Spider-Men matured after experiencing the death of their mentor or loved one. This Spider-Man lost Iron Man but apparently didn't mature at all. He's acting just as clueless as he did when he split the ferry, and when he regretfully gave the glasses away. When will he learn that trusting strangers over his mentors is not the way?? This is his 3rd movie, and he seems dumber than before! I was so mortified by Aunt May's senseless death, and Peter's stupidity, that I was 90% certain that Strange was going to pop out of a portal and reveal to Peter that this was all a mirage to show him what would happen if he went through with the spell, and then they would end up solving his problem some other way. But alas, it was real. The writers actually wrote it this way, and I couldn't help but lose a little respect for the 2 heroes that allowed all this to happen. And yes, Peter matured a tad in the end when he chose to keep his friends safe rather than reunite with them, but he'd lost so much by this point that this minor development felt like a Pyrrhic victory (if we can even call this a victory).9. It took Strange months of rigorous training with world-class sorcerers, deep introspection, and a near-death experience to be able to open a portal. Ned does it accidentally while talking to MJ and then is able to do it at will. Like everything else in the story, this trivializes what Strange went through in his standalone film to acquire his supposedly elite skills. That epic feeling we all felt in Endgame when Strange & co. Opened thousands of portals, reuniting the blipped heroes to join the final battle... oh yeah, that was nothing, Ned can open those too. *eyeroll* This was unnecessary and could have been left out completely. The villains showed up via glitch, not a portal; why couldn't old Spidey 1 & 2 have shown up the same way?10. The story adds insult to injury by stripping us of Peter's character development and every relationship he's built throughout his other 5 films (Spider-Man 1/2, Civil War, Infinity, Endgame). First it undermines these relationships with decisions he would never make, and then just erases them completely. Ouch.The only redeeming parts of the film were when Andrew Garfield got a 2nd chance to save \"his Gwen\" by catching MJ, and the intense eye contact between Toby's Spider-Man and Tom's Spider-Man, when he stopped him from killing Osbourne. I also enjoyed the banter between the 3 of them bonding as \"brothers.\" That's it, the rest was so nonsensical it felt like what Fast 9 did to the rest of its franchise.Overall, while the humor and action were entertaining, the story left me feeling completely drained and walking out empty-handed. Now that Tom Holland's Peter has a fresh start, maybe there are more interesting plots in his future, but personally I feel like scrapping so much of the heart & soul of the other MCU films (not just his own, but any that he appeared in, as Peter) is way too high a price to pay. I gave it a 6/10 because despite all of these problems I'd probably still watch it again at some point, just for the entertainment and because I love the MCU movies altogether. Now that I know the plot is disappointing, I wouldn't expect much and can just enjoy it for what it is. I'm looking forward to seeing Tom Holland in Uncharted; hopefully I'll respect and enjoy his character more than I did in this film.", "Great theatre experience!

It is not necessary to fill in the loose ends, just sit back and enjoy everything that this movie wants to show you (but not explain logically) with all the illusion that you enjoy.", "Spider-man: No way to excellent scenario and graphics": "Disclaimer: I apologize for my level of English. Everything that is written in this review is purely my personal point of view and does not in any way belittle the work of the film authors.I went to this film as a person who has seen all the parts of all spiders since the beginning of the 2000s. I had a certain background of knowledge about comics and films, so I didn't have high expectations. But when I saw the appearance of the canon villains and heroes, the \"wow-effect\" did not happen. There are a number of reasons for this.Picture quality. It looks like the script leaked into the network and the reshoots of the film did not allow to fully process the picture with high quality. The shots on the green screen are too conspicuous, especially the scene of the fight between Strange and Spider-Man.Lack of consistency in some scenario moves. It is unclear why Ned was added magical abilities. To summon spiders? This moment could have been played more logically without this scene (described below). Given that Ned may be the Hobgoblin in the future, having magical powers to \"make it happen\" devalues the film a little. It is also incomprehensible the inaction of MJ and Ned, at the moment when the news shows the high-rise building destroyed by the villains. This scene showed the characters' complete dependence on the protagonist, although MJ was shown in the first 2 films as an independent character with his own personal and critical opinion.This film could be divided into 2 parts:\n1) Finish the first part at the moment of Aunt May's death. At the same time, in the first part, to expand the timing by showing the court scene at the beginning of the film. Otherwise, it turns out that Matt Murdock was shown only for a teaser, and a scene from the film could have been cut out altogether. It would be possible to cut out from the first part the moment with \"Ned's magic\", when he summons other spiders. The emergence of spiders could be shown in a completely different way. Also, the first part could be expanded at the beginning with scenes the trial of the spider, as people hate him. Considering the above, it would be possible to make the first part, based on a chain consisting of the spider's problems from Mysterio, smoothly turning into an apparent positive from the re-education of the villains and ending on the emotional scene of Aunt May's death and the arrival of special forces. The moment of entry of the special forces could have been shown from a helicopter. In this scene, 2 incomprehensible shadows jump into the building (the groundwork for the appearance of old spiders, but not an obvious teaser of them). In fact, a preparation is being made for a new film, where Peter will fix everything, while the old spiders are not shown.2) The second film could begin from the moment the special forces entered the building. At the time of the shooting, special forces could injure Holland, and he would fall into the ruins. In the next scene, special forces goes through a dusty and dark ruined building in search of Holladn's spider. But in the dark, the sounds of webshooters can be heard (a couple of notes from the themes of old spiders could play in the background). When the special force goes to the place where the spider should lie, they don't find it. The next scene begins with the opening of Holladn's eyes in the crypt. He sees MJ and Ned, talks about May's death. Shows the simultaneous grief and desire to take revenge on the villains. But Holland's friends might say something along the lines of \"Don't despair, you're not alone.\" After that, 2 old spiders would descend into the crypt and tell their lifestories. After that, they would explain that they got into this universe together with the villains, they were looking for Holland, but they came too late. After that, the film continued until the moment with the statue of liberty. The appearance of Strange could be realized with the help of Wong. Show the scene of the spiders preparing for the battle at the Statue of Liberty. After that, the camera moves to Sanctum Sanctorum, where MJ and Ned come into in search of help. This can be played up by the fact that they cannot bring the villains back with the help of the cube, and the cube is with the spiders as bait on the statue of liberty. At this moment, a portal opens and Wong and the Abomination enters after the battle from Shang Chi. Wong sends Abomination to prison and switches to MJ and Ned, they explain everything to him. Wong brings Strange home and is already being briefed about spiders. The camera switches to the Statue of Liberty. The battle begins, and in the midst of it Strange, MJ and Ned appear. There is a scene with the fall of MJ, which is saved by Garfield, and right there you can show a flashback with Gwen Stacy. Then the film could go on as intended by the authors. In the final scene with the new costume, one could hint at a new villain. If this is really Craven, as they say in many sources, then show a scene where a spider sits on a tree in search of lawbreakers, the sound of a tightening loop is heard and the spider flies abruptly from the branch. And so it looks like the film was shot with the assumption that Tom Holland would not be given a new trilogy. With an open ending in the movie, it was too early to show the news that there would be 3 more spider movies.As a result, in my opinion, everything would look organic. Having made 2 films, removing some of the scenario voids, Marvel could have raised even more box office. At the same time, having collected less negative reviews. And what was shown on the screen turned out to be a concentrated fan service, from which you can cut out several scenes that do not affect anything.Thank you for reading my review!", "This movie is awesome": "The best Marvel movie yet.When I went to watch the movie, I thought that it would be a normal fight scene film and there would be some action.But this film is the most different movie in Bhai Kya Bataoon.

It's one of the best Marvel movies in history.", "Amazing movie, MUST SEE": "This film had mediocre hype going to see it and wow did it overperform my expectations. 10/10 must see and so glad my friends convinced me to go see it with them.", "Spider-Man: White Spider-Verse": "Spider-Man: White Spider-Verse is entertaining enough for a narrative focused primarily on fan service rather than the steady character development showcased in the first 2 features of the series.", "One of my fav movies": "Very good experience. This Spiderman is really fantastic. It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. The people in the cinema clapped and cheered multiple times, at the appearance of key characters and at big hint of what the future holds for Spiderman. I loved every second of it!", "Could've been so much more": "All the scenes with Tobey/Tom/Andrew were amazing but too little too late. They could've done so much more with these three and really milk it good but we got the bare minimum. Oh man the potential.The rest of the film was pretty lackluster and kinda boring tbh. Expected so much more.", "EPIC": "Everything about the movie was epic.. From the supervillain teamup to every battle.. the vfx was amazing and no matter how high you pay for the ticket, it's still worth it....", "Spoiler Warning": "Right where Far From Home left off, the secret of Spider-Man's ID is revealed. Peter and MJ swing away from everyone and heads to Peters house where Aunt May and Happy are breaking up and everyone outside yell at Peter and everything. TV turns on where after a short bit Aunt May and Happy see that Peters secret is revealed on the news. Fast forward Peter is in custody being questioned by the police and a bit after Daredevil makes a quick cameo acting as Peters lawyer and catches a brick that is thrown through the window. This is the first 30 minutes of the movie that sets up for what's about to happen. Than Peter and Aunt May move to Happys place to get away from the angry Mysterio fans. So after a bit Peter Ned and MJ apply for M. I. T and they all get rejected for the reasons surrounding Peter. This is where the plot happens. Peter goes to Dr Strange to erase what Mysterio did but instead Strange suggests to wipe out the memory of everyone forgetting that Peter is Spider-Man and basically he isn't relevant to anyone but Peter tampers with the spell 5 times which during that time some villains escape their universe and come to the MCU world. So after Strange kicks Peter out of the Sanctum Santorum and Peter tries to find the head of M. I. T by calling Flash who got into M. I. T and bribes Peter for him swinging him to school for 2 weeks. So Peter chases her down on her way to the airport and we see our first villain. Doc Ock who battles Peter. Epic fight scene, he realizes that this isn't the Spider-Man he remembers. Peter hacks Doc Ock's tentacles and saves the MIT lady who gives Peter Ned and MJ a second chance of entering the school. Next we get a glimpse of Green Goblin, but just a second or 2 of seeing him before we are transferred into Doctor Stanges holding cell as I'll call it. This is where the movie kicks into high gear and I'll save the rest for later. Overall my favorite Spider-Man movie of all time.", "The Best Spider-Man Movie Of All Time": "Everything about the film is perfect. The acting is perfect, the writing is perfect, the dialogue is perfect, the CG is perfect, the humor is perfect, the timing is perfect. It's just too good.

Peter Parker in this movie takes responsibility for his actions and tries to help everyone he can, including his adversaries. Helping them return home with a chance of surviving and turning on a man he respects when he refuses to help them. After the villains turn and the Goblin kills his Aunt, Peter is full of rage. He wants to kill him. It takes the guidance of the much more experienced Spider-men (Toby Magiure and Andrew Garfield) to stop him from killing Norman and instead save him and send him home. By the end of the movie Peter is faced with the ultimate decision. Bring the world to chaos or erase himself from everyone's memory. He takes responsibility for his actions, Peter is now alone. No Aunt, No Girlfriend, No best friend, and no other heroes who remember him. But he goes out there again as Spider-Man, being the new symbol of hope that he was always meant to be. We see our fan favorites Like Toby, Andrew, and Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock. But we see a grand and spectacular development of Tom Holland's Peter Parker grow from a boy to a man, one that is really ready for what awaits him.", "Movie of the Decade": "This may be the movie of the decade. I have never seen a movie this good and i probably never will. This changes a lot in the mcu and even though the movie is pretty dark I found it as personal growth for Peter Parker. Andrew and Tobey's appearance was anticipated and when it happened I was so happy. There are many sad scenes in this move but they don't make this movie bad, they make it realistic that is part of a good movie, unfortunate moments.

My screening was nearly full, and for the first time in my life, people cheered!! I'm from the Philippines, where that isn't as frequent as it is in the United States.

Every one has acted in the best possible way!And seeing all of them after all these years creates a little sympathy and love towards them\nExcept all the stuff (i.e. Spoilers) this movie is really a kind of tribute to all the spiderman fans who have been loving a small teenager having great powersAnd I would like to tell few things that you should do to enjoy the movie to its fullest-\n1) AVOID SPOILERS this is the foremost thing to do\nDon't even google about spiderman even while booking tickets, don't see the cast because there is something more unexpected\n2) Watch all the spiderman movies like-\nSpiderman 1, spiderman 2, spiderman 3\nThe Amazing Spiderman 1, The Amazing Spiderman 2\nSpiderman homecoming, Spiderman Far From Home\nVenom\nVenom Let there be Carnage(optional, but do watch it's post credit scenes)\n3) Watch all these movies again!\ud83d\ude02\nThis is to an extent necessary because there are moments where there are nudges to the previous movies which make you laugh or make you nostalgicSo that's it for the review!

I like how it doesn't focus all on the fan service which is a major mistake that's done by other franchises. Endgame, was good on its fan service part but it was wasted later on which was disappointing to say the least.This movie isn't focused on just bringing back old characters at all, no. This is a film which I would describe as the beginning to the MCU's Spidey, nothing more, nothing less. I couldn't ask for a better origin story than this, although not being the total and accurate origin in its comic book counterpart, it still has that spider-man feel into it.Some part were a bit bland, but overall, this mixture was done well, and the outcome is everything a spider man fan could ever want.", "Not the best but not the worst either": "Film was AMAZING as a Fan Service but gotta say the CGI was completely sucks.

It had great reviews and I was up for a fun time at the theater.About an hour in, I just wanted it to end. The plot was thin, characters kept getting introduced as villains from all the other Spider-Man universes and then a long, protracted effort began to get everyone home.There was a surprise return of some characters in the second half of the movie which I won't spoil, and that gave it some life for a while, but then it just evolved back into the same silly charade.I was disappointed with this movie. Lots of visual eye candy but not enough protein.A few other observations:\nThe web swinging scenes are like watching a video game. Computer graphics are taking over films and it's getting to be too much.The dialogue was annoying. Likes of babble and attempted humor that falls flat.Too many stars battling for screen time. My guess is that's why it is so long.", "Very problematic": "This movie has great action, and it's so fun to see the other universes. However, I found it very problematic in that it basically takes on a martyr idea/\"I can fix other people\" mentality. Peter was right when he initially said \"not my problem\".", "A lot of fun, but not flawless.": "I grew up watching all the Spiderman movies and this one is a lot of fun. It gives a ton of closure to some of the past characters and we get to see a lot of familiar nostalgic faces. However, the first arc of the film is dull and emotionless with very low stakes. It felt like the narrative was forcefully put together to meet the film's agenda. Dr. Strange acts very out of character. A lot of the logic behind the multiverse and aspects of the film are messy and unclear. Third act felt rushed at the end with most of the villians going down extremely easy, making you again feel not tense with very low stakes. You kind of know the entire third act that the villains are going to get their ass kicked easily. Which takes a lot of the suspense and drama away that they built up in the second act.Overall fun and exciting experience.", "Best Spiderman movie/Marvel movie to date": "Spiderman: No Way Home has been long awaited for almost 2 years now building up hopes and hype for this movie. Without a doubt it has lived up to the hype and more, this movie was everything you could ask for as a Spiderman/Marvel fan being an incredible cinematic experience. It was great to see Tobey and Andrew once more along side Tom with amazing fight scenes redeeming the villains and giving them one last chance. This film showed great character arc for Tom Hollands Spiderman along side is 2 previous films perfectly setting it up for another trilogy with a more original Spiderman vibes. I'm really excited to see what Sony and Marvel have in store fie the future of Spiderman.", "A nostalgic experience": "After watching the movie two times, I must admit that Spider-Man: No Way Home is an emotional rollercoaster.I'm sure that everybody, who is familiar with the Spider-Man universe and the previous films, was surprised by the returning characters. I personally almost sprung out of my seat as I watched Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire return (all the villains returning were also outstanding moments). Had much luck, that I didn't get spoiled. At that point it was a 10/10 experience.Know you may ask why I rated the film an 8/10.This whole movie was build up on nostalgia and I personally wasn't satisfied with the ending. In my opinion this movie didn't really add much to the story. Making everybody except Peter forget about him is kinda lame. It just resets everything and sets it back to the first film of the trilogy. I'm really interested in how they want to continue Spider-Man's story. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't see the point of reseting the story. Still a really fun and nostalgic experience.Thank you for this great movie!", "The Epitome of a Trilogy": "A truly excellent way to end a well built trilogy with an exclusive and inclusive comedic aspect.

If you used to love him, you will love him more now. And if he never completely convinced you in the previous episodes, this time he will please you. The work also includes a short film for Benedict Cumberbatch, starring Dr. Strange.This is a film that has taken time to watch all three of Toby Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and, of course, Tom Holland, and at the same time it seems clever, it has the feel of Spider-Man 8.But arguably most importantly, the film features fully formed characters. Is it interesting to see people like Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe in the movie Spydy? I'm a big fan of Spider-Man trilogy directed by Sam Remy in the early 21st century, so any connection to that old movie series is a pleasure for me. Sure, in such a story, some of the characters go a little deeper than others, but almost everyone has a good time to tell their story. And besides, even in the midst of so many punches and kicks and action movies, we are reminded for once that the superhero is not just punching and kicking, and that's great.", "This must be the world's worst movie.": "After seeing the first 30 minutes of the movie I didn't understand anything.

I remember saying to myself WTF IS GOING ON??? Because i was so confused. Nothing seemed to make sense till about 1:30 in the movie.

Without this, the picture is uneven, with a complete imbalance of irony and drama and a lack of integrity of the constituent parts. Not to mention the fact that there is no development in the story, the plot resets everything and simply embodies the fantasies of geeks into reality. Not even visually impressive. But the characters play excellently, powerfully, nostalgia overflows. Apparently this is the idea.", "Great movie, I recommend it to everyone!": "It's been so long since I've been to the cinema. But then I was offered to go, and even to the most anticipated film by all fans of Marvel comics, well, or just superheroes. I couldn't refuse this! And the first thing I will say in relation to the movie \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\": \"Wow!\". Yes, I'm absolutely delighted! And first of all I advise you to watch this movie on the big screen. It's in the cinema. To make the most of the work done by the creators of this amazing film.", "Very Nice": "They did it! A Spider-Man trilogy finally stuck the landing! Spider-Man: No Way Home is an impressive culmination of the films that came before it, with an engaging storyline, exciting action, laugh out loud moments, and dramatic consequences. The beginning climb is a little slow, but it's an exhilarating ride once things get swinging. I don't exactly know how this movie will hold up after multiple viewings, as there are some plot points that don't quite make sense when you start to think about them, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself this first time.", "I am delighted with this movie!": "I watched Spider-Man No Way Home at the cinema. I was waiting for the film for a very long time, when I watched the trailer, I was completely sure that I would go to this premiere.I did not expect from such a large scale and moments of the film. There were funny, sad and sweet moments.The beginning was, frankly, boring. But from the appearance of the effects and the old spider-men, I sat with my mouth open! Finally, Tom Holland was revealed as a real man, and not an errand boy and a Marvel fan. And then a love affair with the main character and grief was revealed, as well as saving the city with the help of the team. Thanks to the director for such a miracle!", "Review of the movie Spider-Man: No Way Home": "We all remember well from childhood how the story of this super hero began, according to which all the boys were fans. As I remember now, the Ren-TV channel fox kids and cartoons about spider man. Then I could not even think that all this would be embodied in the cinematic universe, at first just the universe of spider-man, and then it would smoothly move into the Marvel cinematic universe. But yes, it came true from a dream into reality, and each of us from those boys running around the yard, already in adulthood and conscious age, watches all this on the big screens of cinemas. It all started back in 2002, when the wonderful director Sam Raimi first transferred the well-known comic book superhero to the big screens of cinema, well, then we all remember very well how the story of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker developed in the next two films, which In my opinion one is better than the other. The story of Spider-Man from Sam Raimi ended in 2007 with the film, Spider-Man: The Enemy in Reflection, and in my opinion it was super, to end just like that, because the world saw for the first time on movie screens such an antagonist as Venom, finally it was revealed who killed Uncle Ben, the returned goblin, but already in the guise of Peter Parker's best friend, it was all a masterpiece, but everything comes to an end, like the Spider-Man film series at the helm of which was Sam Raimi. 5 years have passed and the legendary superhero, whom the world has not seen for such a long time, returns to the cinema screens. But something changed, Sam Raimi was no longer at the helm, and Andrew Garfield, who was still unknown at that time, appeared in the lead role. A new era has come. NEW SPIDER-MAN, which introduces us to the new adventures of a friendly neighbor, it is a pity, of course, that this new spider-man had not enough films, only two. That would seem to be all, Spider-Man will never visit cinema screens again, ant-men began to appear, the screens and the attention of the audience were completely captured by films with the Avengers, etc., but who would have thought that the creators of the film The First Avenger would surprise us like that : Confrontation, where the good old Spider-Man will return to the screens and take his rightful niche in the MCU. The role of Peter is now entrusted to the young and talented Tom Holland, who, in my opinion, suits the role of Spider-Man very well, because you still have to agree that in the first comic book Peter Parker was a teenager, and Tom Holland is just that. So going to the cinema to see \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" meant a lot, because I was very afraid that the film would not work for me as a fan of the MCU and, in principle, a fan of Spider-Man separately, but this did not happen, because the film turned out so awesome that going to the movies was worth it. I have never been to a movie theater where people applauded, I remember, goosebumps, everything was so cool. After watching, of course, I listened to a lot of opinions and most, unfortunately, were not the best. I will say this, this film will be really cool for those who are fans of MARVEL films and TV shows and watched everything from cover to cover and are aware of all the cases and capture the whole meaning of what is happening. The one who just goes to the movies to see what is wow cool, this is the new spiderman, etc.d, no guys, the film is not for you, there will be a lot of dialogues that, in principle, will not hook you, well, for that you can look at the action scenes and the return of the good old spiders in the role of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, but again, you won't explain how and why they got there. So it's better to wait for the movie in good quality when it is already released on the Internet and think whether you should watch it or not, because after watching it in the cinema you will say that you spent money for nothing and slept through half the session on dialogues. Very cool the film will go to the younger generation, who, in principle, do not care about the meaning, but if only they would let them watch a fantastic fairy tale about superheroes, so that the children will be satisfied.MARVEL fan rating: 10 out of 10\nRating from the average viewer: 5 out of 10\nRating from children: 8 out of 10.", "Amazed, but 90 percent)": "I don't want to scold the newly emerged spider, but somehow I personally didn't have enough for a thin one\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\nIt seems that the plot is good, it seems that they have collected all the villains, it seems that they have gathered three spiders together, but for some reason I was not very surprised. But at the same time, I don't want to say that it's bad, because they worked on the plot, the special effects were done very cool. In general, everything is very good. But for those who had high expectations for this film, it may be disappointing. It's not really worth it. And soooo, this is my kind of personal opinion. There will be time, then devote it to this film, perhaps you will not regret it very much and will be delighted! Happy viewing)", "GOOD MOVIE!": "A wonderful movie!

I hope for a new trilogy they will take a stronger director who can do action, humor, and a strong drama.To sum up, No Way Home is worth watching, I tried my best to tell about it without spoilers. On Friday, my extended opinion will be released in video format, including with all the spoilers. Well, the film is easiest to describe as: a good film, without revelations. But during the viewing all the same, everyone applauds and yells. And not just once. You will understand my words when you watch the film.From me 7/10\nDidn't make it to 8 a bit. I got a lot of emotions, but this is more likely a merit not of the story, and other important aspects, but of fan service with familiar characters. I hope that further - better, since now the hopes are not unfounded.", "A long-awaited return to childhood": "Many have been waiting for this film as the long-awaited conclusion to the trilogy. And after watching the movie, I can say with confidence that the creators were able to show something more than just a movie. This is a real return to childhood. It's like going back to your childhood for two and a half hours, when you're six years old and you're watching Spider-Man on an old TV. This film exceeded all my expectations, it was able to combine everything for which I fell in love with Spider-Man. In the hall in which I watched the film, every now and then they sighed nostalgically when a character from childhood appeared on the screen. It was as if I had returned to that dock-like time, when the halls were completely packed and you, together with the hall, could feel all the emotions that people are experiencing at the moment. It was nice to see old friends, such as the same Willem Dafoe (he remained the same as I remembered him in childhood), and Alfred Molina, who seemed not to have aged since our last meeting with him. After watching the movie, you get the feeling that you met old friends whom you haven't seen for a long time.", "Films": "Ending a trilogy is typically a monumental task, but what No Way Home accomplished is nothing short of miraculous. What they kept from audiences successfully, the technical feat, the story they put together and most of all the brilliant performances, should be commended for years to come. It's hard to argue with people that this is the best Spider-Man film to date. I still need more time. All I'll say is, 2021 is the most consistently great year Marvel has ever had and we should never doubt their ability ever again.", "The greatest Spider-man": "\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is a great entertaining movie for both Marvel fans and those who are neutral to this universe. The film initially made a lot of noise - this is one of the main premieres of December, according to the scene, in Australia. The hall in the cinema at the first morning session of \"Spider-Man\" on the day of its release on the big screens gathered a huge number of views - by the way, quite noisy, several times during the film the hall simply exploded with applause. Which, however, is not surprising, the dedication of Marvel tried - and they got sweetie.", "I won't see a better movie": "I didn't expect to see such a gorgeous cast, great acting. Spider-Man is one of my favorite superheroes, so when I saw even THREE spider-men in the movie itself, I was wildly delighted ... A very interesting and unpredictable plot . The most important thing for me is the presence of excellent humor , which was even enough in the film ! The presence of beautiful graphics and alternative universes in the film shocked me . I will definitely watch this greatest movie more than once... I cried and applauded standing up .", "10 spiders 10": "Rarely does a film come out that pulls audiences together as much as No Way Home is likely to. In recent years, experts have been unanimous about the death of film distribution, but the final part of the spider trilogy restores justice in the industry and returns a large audience to the halls (even if only for a couple of weekends). The key to this phenomenon lies not only in the fanbase: superhero Jon Watts sums up not only the events of the new reboot, but also the previous two Peter Parker series, thereby making the hall breathe, laugh and cry in unison.", "Bright, dynamic, colorful!": "Well, here is a well-thought-out scenario, and the storyline is striking in how well familiar and new anti-heroes appear.The acting is excellent and professional. Sitting in the cinema, you seem to feel everything that is happening and worry about every ill-conceived step of the protagonist. The storyline may seem predictable to you, but this is only at first glance. Here, one is very closely intertwined with the other. The scenario is well thought out and targeted, that is, everyone who appears on the path of the protagonist has his own reasons and events that brought him here.Special effects and graphics are of high quality and colorful, there are no complaints at all. The musical accompaniment is dynamic and atmospheric. The film literally flies by, and the scenes after the credits intrigue and fascinate.", "Geat": "An excellent movie to watch. Special effects on the level. Cameo of old, kind characters pleased. Marvel, as always, sets the bar for making films about superheroes. For those who do not know what to see a good option. To stumble and see something new in the life of a friendly neighbor Spider-Man.", "Well done!": "Gorgeous! Marvel and Sony give everyone a New Year's gift, and they do it in a beautiful way. I met such a hero as Spiderman 20 years ago, but only now I begin to understand who he is. The film contains both high-quality action and personal drama. Powerful soundtracks, unexpected twists, ground for development, discovery of personalities - it's all here. The Spider-Man movies make us think that whether you're Peter Parker or not, it doesn't matter, anyone can be a hero. It doesn't matter if they know you by sight, if someone knows that you are a hero, just be one when you have to.", "Review of the movie \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" (2021)": "Spider-Man is one of my favorite superheroes, so for his sake I still found time to get out to the cinema and watch a movie.The plot of the film is quite interesting, with its simplicity, the film is quite fascinating, despite the fact that it runs for almost two and a half hours. This time is practically not felt.But I will not say that the film is so exciting that you watch it \"in one breath\", no it is not. There are a lot of non-dynamic moments in it, which greatly reduce the degree of intensity and inner mood. That is, you are set up to continue the dynamics in the frame, and you are included in rather long dialogues that are not always interesting (at least to me).The cast is excellent, Cumberbatch is playing the role of a mentor here and I must say he is not bad. Molina and Defoe are great in their roles. Fox and Hayden Church did not particularly like them, somehow they are very much lost against the background of the two masters. Well, it was very nice to see another actor, although I never really liked him in this role, but here he looks good (he has matured), it was not for nothing that he shook his rights to the creators). Well, after the credits there is a very good cameo, I advise you to wait).In general, the film did not meet my expectations, but they were probably too high.And so a good film that gives us not only food for thought and analysis, but also hope for the appearance and return of our favorite characters.I recommend it for viewing.", "god film": "Rarely does a film come out that pulls audiences together as much as No Way Home is likely to.

The truth, of course, is somewhere nearby, and you do not need to have a spider sense to get to it.", "COOL!": "The film is very cool. Hooked with its plot, especially the fact that there was a full cast from the past parts. I would love to watch this movie again and again.I would like to thank for the disclosed plot, despite the fact that the main creator is no more, the film was completed extremely successfully.The film is filled with emotions, allows them to survive as if in reality. Many bright and touching moments that take the soul. Also not without the main scene, which was wonderfully played.", "There is so much to unpack here.": "There is so much to unpack here. And I understand that some people may not be into the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but it is apparent how much almost everyone loves this movie. And as you can tell I am one of them. Now you could dismiss my opinion, since I have clearly bought and swallowed the MCU pill (I openly admit liking and being a fan boy of what has been created there - you can hate me or simply agree with me, all opinions are welcome) ... but I dare anyone who has seen all Spider Man movies, not to feel at least something rather positive about this.It does take many good things from previous efforts (no pun intended) and gets the best out of them. It does a great service to the (movie) history of Spider-Man. But also showing us a different side of a Marvel hero ... a side that is vulnerable in a way we have not seen yet. Or not in that form - the identity crisis and the good deeds that do not go unpunished ... or do they? Tom Holland has been exposed - something you know if you've seen the previous Spider-Man movie ... and while his mentor Iron Man dealt differently with that fame - recognition, Peter Parker as we know him, can not deal with it the same way.Add to that, that he wants to help people as much as he can (a bit of a difference to what Tony Stark stood for most of the time, being self centered and and self serving) - and you have a dangerous combination. There is a reason the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies are being compared with 80s teen comedies - there are many parallels (John Hughes and others are being name dropped in those conversations). And while there is a lot of action (the mirror world scene has so many \"climactic\" scenes I probably did not close my mouth the entire time it was happening), the movie also takes its time to give us little character moments.And a lot of fan service - this movie celebrates what came before. It celebrates and takes its audience seriously. But in a fun and entertaining way. Yes it is not all fun and games and there are a lot of callbacks (no pun intended) - there is drama, there may be even some head shaking at how naive Peter Parker seems ... but it makes sense in the realm of the world that was built around him and the character that he is - there is an evolution, but he can't help himself - being who he is and who he grew up to be. For better or worse ... yes the famous line will be uttered and it will have a sad undertone to it. But the movie is able to give you so much, that even when you know something completely horrible is about to happen, you also know that some lighter moments will follow.That being said, it takes nothing away from the performance by Tom Holland, who has to play vulnerable, playful, ecstatic, experimental, shy and giving/helpful ... while a lot has been made of who is going to be in the movie (or not) - it is his movie. Yes there are many things that you can tear apart and make fun of - there are logic issues if you want to call them that ... but in a world where \"magic\" exists ... are you really going to nitpick? Maybe you will, which would be a shame - because you'll be missing out on one hell of a movie and a ride that is truly amazing - no pun intended.It is also amazing that Sony and Disney reached a deal - so that Marvel can continue to use Spiderman in their universe. But not just him ... it seems there is way more to come. And while having many throwbacks (and callbacks) and bringing them all to a conclusion of sorts ... well while all that could mean that this could be a nice way to end Tom Hollands reign as Spider-Man ... it could just as easily continue. The possibilities are endless going forward.As you can tell I am not one to spoil or say anything that is revealing. That is why I did not talk about the cast and the cameos - most of them were revealed ahead of time. Either officially (villains) or just through rumors (no matter how much denying went on - we knew ... we just knew) ... but there was a cameo that most did not see coming - pun very much intended.If you watched this in a cinema (which I can only highly recommend to do), you will probably still have goosebumps. You either cheered yourself loudly at quite a few moments (or gasped at others) ... or just enjoyed silently ... what a movie experience that was. One that I might repeat in cinemas - a treat I do not give myself too often, because I tend to let a bit of time pass before I rewatch something after the first time viewing ... but there are exceptions and this might very well be one of them ... Spider-Man you Sir ... are one of the good ones! Pun again intended - because you too are amazing ...", "i realy like that": "Now is my favourite film, not onle for me , my family likes that to\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb\n.......................................................\nthe saddest part of all!

Great ending to a legendary story, in my opinion.", "Jonny English Vibes": "I've only seen the first Spiderman movie to compare to and was amazed at how utterly lame this movie was. Tom Holland is a star and a great actor clearly, but the script and the story line were unbelievably corny and confused.I know we're all supposed to be postmodernists now that laugh at ourselves and point out the flaws in a narrative but the level of self-referencing was absurd and very annoying. The movie also continued this anti-hero thing where the baddies are all complex and we have to tie our emotions in knots trying to figure out the psychology, that's not what I watch superhero movies for.I also found the goofiness a bit much. Spiderman is now SO relatable he's not just a bit shy she's an absolute goofball of incompetence. There were times when the friends were just babbling on like senile old people! What is going on?The multiverse thing was way, way, way over the top, confused and silly; albeit with some cool effects.The inclusion of the other Spidermans was toe-curlingly self-referential. Honestly is this still a superhero movie or a lame parody of one?I think the more emotional scenes were the best thing about it. It was done fairly well, but they didn't chime well with the prior mentioned goofing around and bad in-jokes.I've read some reviews saying this movie is not as silly as some of the others! HA! This is the last one I'll see then.", "Love film": "The identity of the spider was discovered by the villain Mysterio at the end of the 2nd part, and it turns out to be Peter Parker, whose world immediately changed, because now he is a public figure.

At the last moment, the spider was afraid that everyone would forget him and make adjustments to the spell, which disrupt the order of things and the multiverse begins to collapse, sending various villains and allies to the lands.Action begins.I really liked the plot of the picture. Special effects at the highest level, all your favorite actors. The film keeps you in suspense until the very end. I advise everyone to start watching the movie, especially for fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.", "Interesting": "The problems of the script are noticeable primarily in the elaboration of the characters. Doctor Strange, for the sake of the whole circus, became a clinical idiot and weakened so much that he lost to a schoolboy in his own dimension. Peter, not lagging behind the elder, became even more stupid, for the umpteenth time creating problems for himself from scratch and climbing where he should not be several times in the film. The previous events apparently taught him nothing at all. The situation is similar with all the villains without exception, some of whom do not have not only motivation, but even minimal logic in their actions.", "La ostia": "La mejor puta peli de la historia vale la pena ver todas las 7 peliculas anteriores de Spiderman para disfrutar la sensacion de esta.Es imposible que el mayor fan de marvel viva una mejor experiencia viendo infinity war o endgame que el mayor fan de spiderman viendo no way home.", "No more home": "A beautiful visual series, the execution of the fans' wishes and... It seems this is the prologue of a new series?We hear about great responsibility every time just at the beginning of each series (I mean - 'trilogy' - or other types). Of course, these are references, and an attempt at revenge, too. But in fact, the entire history of the Spider has been erased and here it is a field for extensive activity. The ability to grow a hero virtually from the cradle.In the previous series, we saw most of the Spider as an application. Even in solo albums. And now, in my opinion, it's time for real solo albums.There is a favorite actor, a good actor!There is a great full cast! They are not just familiar, they are all open to us as characters, we believe that we know who they are, what they feel.We don't actually have a history of this Spider-Man. He helps save the world, and even when he turns out to be deanonymous, we are told the story not of this Spider-Man, but of the actual completion of the phase. Not Black Widow her ending, but Spider-Man: No way home.Spider-Man doesn't have a home anymore.", "My impression": "The first impression of viewing caused a desire to quote Barney Stinson from \"How I Met Your mother\" - it was legendary. Therefore, moving away from emotions, I want to explain my feelings from watching.It's no secret that Spider-Man is the most popular superhero and not only Marvel, but in general. In this regard, the expectations from each of the films with his participation are simply off the scale. It is always extremely difficult to meet the expectations of skeptics, let alone fans...Marvel and Sony make a New Year's gift to everyone, and do it in a beautiful manner. I met such a hero as Spider-Man about 20 years ago, but only now I begin to understand who he is. The film fits both high-quality action and personal drama. Powerful soundtracks, unexpected twists, the ground for development, the discovery of personalities - all this is here. Spider-Man movies make us think that you are Peter Parker or not, it doesn't matter, anyone can be a hero. It doesn't matter if they know you by sight, if anyone knows that you are a hero, just be them when you have to.Each genre has its own fan and its own hater. Surely everyone has heard from friends that they do not like superhero movies, just advise them to watch it once, then they will understand everything themselves. And if they don't want to, they won't even know what they're losing.This film gives hope, it fills with pleasure, it is more than just a superhero action movie. The Marvel cinematic universe, and in this case with the participation of Sony, has turned into a powerful team that feels the desires of the audience and embodies them. Many childhood dreams are now on the screen and everyone can feel them. Cinema is for the audience, viewers are earnings for studios. And this balance has been caught, I would really like it to be preserved as long as possible.High-quality movies that exceed all expectations, whether you like this genre or not, in any case, enjoy watching!", "10 spiders out of 10!": "How to describe in words a film that caused you just a storm of real, genuine emotions?

How to describe all this? This is a unique spectacle that cannot even be called a movie. This is not a movie. This is more than a movie.

This character is made independent and closer to the canon. He has always been a character other than Superman and Batman. He was poor, he had only an uncle and an aunt, he was not popular, he was bullied by other students and even as a hero he was not liked by the media. His life was full of problems, he solved domestic problems at the same time as heroic ones, this is his feature, which he was deprived of in the first two films with Tom Holond.", "Very sentimental and slushy for an action movie": "More of the movie spent having deep conversations about life with Spiderman determined to make the baddies into goodies, which isn't very exciting from an action movie perspective.", "I love SPIDERMAN": "(This comment DOESN'T contain spoilers)\nThis movie is really something special. It has stunning special effects and amazing performances. Tom Holland has really given his best preformance. The plot really amazed me just as much as the ending.

Most of the interesting parts are from the multi-verse perspectives, rather than spider-man stuff.This version of Peter Park had such a good relationship with Tony Stark and the potential for a unique character development that's different from the other two spider-man versions, but the writers seem to not care at all. And instead of creating something new for this character under his learnings and personal relationships under Tony's mentorship, they go all the way and force the event of Aunt May's death and make it exactly like Uncle Ben from the first spider-man trilogy, no, actually it's worse, the performance of the great power great responsibility line is terrible. There goes 20 years of nothing.In the end, Happy illustrates how May's death is comparable to Tony's death. I just want to say Excuse Me??? Happy and Tony had decades of personal friendship and has been portrayed very well in the Iron Man trilogy, how is his death in any sense comparable to May's?They also didn't utilize the villains very well. They feel more like marketing props than actual characters. Just because they are popular from the previous spider-man films, and now Marvel got all the rights settles with Sony, doesn't mean you just completely don't make new efforts in developing these wonderful villain characters.Tom Holland, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Willem Dafoe all have wonderful performances as genuinely good actors. The execution of this film is alright. I just think the writing for this film is really, really terrible.It feels like because anything with the three spider-mans' combination would make tons of money, they just didn't make effort into actually creating something new and higher level than what we have been experiencing with spider-man and marvel characters in the past 20 years.", "It would have been \"Amazing\" without the jokes & fan service.": "My first impressions.

For me this is the second best movie of the whole mcu with Endgame being the best. But this one comes very close!I am a great fan of the Amazing Spider-Man movies as well. I could relate to them more emotionally than the other ones. So there is one scene in \"No way home\" in particular that gave me goosebumps the most and i just thought \"Yes Andrew, you got her!\".Just an Amazing Movie!", "Phenomenal movie, thrilling action": "***This review reflects my personal opinions about the movie, and for those who may wish to retain a pristine first-time viewing experience, it may contain a few spoilers***With Spiderman's identity revealed in the antecedent movie \"Spider-Man: Far From Home,\" the movie \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" explores how Spiderman seeks help from Dr. Strange and how things spiral out of control when Dr. Strange's spell goes wrong. Now, Spiderman is forced to deal with the consequences of his wish. The movie is a superhero action and adventure movie produced by Pascal Pictures, Marvel Studios, and Columbia Pictures.The film starts with Spiderman's developing problems after his identity is revealed. This unfortunate incident negatively impacts his friends' admission to MIT because of their links to him. Desperate to reverse the effects of his known identity, Spiderman requests a favor from Dr. Strange. It only becomes worse from here as Dr. Strange's spell goes out of hand because of disruptions from Peter Parker. Now, Spiderman faces problems dealing with villains from other universes due to his error. As the movie progresses, Spiderman becomes more responsible for his actions and tries to right his wrongs.The movie \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" explores themes of true friendship as Peter Parker (Spiderman), Ned, and MJ form a formidable bond that is crucial to Peter's progress in the movie. Sacrifice, selflessness, and a sense of responsibility revolve around the main character. These themes are evident in Peter's actions from being na\u00efve and less responsible to trying to correct his bad and fighting for his enemies, the villains, to have a chance to live despite suffering great losses. The Peter Parker's trio with Ned and MJ portrayed teamwork as an underpinning factor for success.The cast did a great job by executing their roles commendably well. The actors did well to portray their characters not just independently, but also with other characters. For example, Tom Holland, Tobey Maguire, and Andrew Garfield infused good chemistry between the Spidermen in the roles they respectively played. A balance of lightened emotions in intense scenes made the movie more interesting. Seldom jokey or punny lines from the characters and good dialogue add flavor to the movie.Furthermore, the film's cinematography is appreciated with each swing of Spiderman from building to building and structure to structure. It is like getting a virtual feeling of being swung in the air. Music for each scene is properly planned to induce the right emotions of sadness, love, disappointment, intenseness, action, and so on. A careful arrangement of scenes building up in a crescendo till the climax and resolution makes the screenplay more laudable. All these elements attest to an excellent movie script and direction.Although the movie is properly planned and executed, I feel that it could and should have taken less time to get into the action. Some not-too-necessary scenes could also have been shortened to save time. The basis for the storyline could also have been improved because if Spiderman had not disrupted Dr. Strange in his spell casting, the movie might have been baseless. Nonetheless, the movie still has a pretty good production.In summary, would I recommend this movie to you? Why not! With the interesting themes the movie portrays, the surprises (as I didn't give too much of that), and the actions packed into the movie, it will be a worthwhile two and a half hours of great entertainment!", "Into the MCUltiverse": "Wow. This movie is a hell of a ride.It goes without saying that pretty much all of our Spidey prayers were answered with the numerous call outs, cameos and returning SM alumni. But on top of this it's just so much fun.Yes of course it plays up to all the fans wants and hopes but why should that be a bad thing? Movies are there to transport us somewhere else and NWH does that throughout.Charlie Cox's early cameo was perfect and sets up his return in future movies or shows - and with Vincent D'onofrio's Kingpin appearing on Hawkeye the very same day it'll be great to see them sparring again.Alfred Molina and Wilem Defoe are superb as Doc Ock and the Green Goblin (I've always loved Molina's troubled Doc in particular).The main draw is the worst kept secret ever. The return of Tobey and Andrew as Spidey 2 and 3 (not my name for them. See the movie) Garfield in particular reminds us how good he was as the troubled teen web slinger. The 3 bounce off each other beautifully and it's a joy to behold.My only negatives are that the first 20 minutes feels like rewatching the trailers (not really a bad thing as it's good most of the rest of the movie was mainly brand new) and secondly it's a shame that James Franco's Harry didn't join in the fun - he would certainly have given closure for Norman.But these are minor niggles. I can honestly say that was the quickest 150 minutes ever as it flew by leaving me wanting more - I'll be going back over the weekend to see what I missed first time!Oh. And the mid credit cameo for Tom Hardy. Brilliant!!", "Without spoilers": "I was afraid when I started seen every reviewer saying it was good, usually that comes with some artistic view most of the times trying to justify a major change to the original story or character or simply trying to be edgy.Not this one, there is fan service, some cheesy, some that we didn't even know we wanted.But this was written with care, for the other movies, actors, heroes, villains.

Tom Holland is a star\nTom Hardy i wait for you.", "Really good movie right up un til the very end!": "I want to just start off by saying that i think the movie is good, i really think it is, but for me the ending kinda just kills that happy spark. The fact that Peter didnt try to explain to MJ like he promised just did not feel right. He lost both his best friend and his girlfriend, not only that but he lost them AFTER he promised to get them back. Why? I dont know, probably because they got into MIT and were happy bla bla bla. Them getting to know peter again would not change that, and the fact that he chose that happiness over their relationships feels off.To me it feels like their relationships were all for nothing, 2.5 movies of building their bond to just throw it out the window is what really make this a 6/10 instead of (probably) a 9/10.But hey! Atleast we got 3 spideys :)", "Remarkable": "The best Spider-Man to date. The acting was superb, the story exhilarating and I've never been in a cinema which the audience cheered and clapped.

It's the same narrative again and again. Spider-Man tries something feels bad about it, makes a mistake and pretty much destroys things around him and then try and fix it in the end.It was very predictable but this time just a few added nostalgic moments were the heart of the story.Overall a great entertaining one time watch movie.", "One of the best movies I've seen in ages": "When I tell you this movie was damn near perfect, I mean it. It had action and drama, comedy and suspense, and it never failed to provide subtle cheesiness that we should expect from comic book movies. I'd give it an 11 if I could. Hats off to everyone involved in production.", "11/10. Elevates the genre to critical status. (No spoilers, chill)": "We went to see Spiderman: No Way Home (The shops were very quiet, I have 4 home testing kits and the cinema showing the movie had only sold 8 seats).I can simply say that it is the best movie I ever saw, and I have seen everything from Citizen Kane and 12 Angry Men down to The Crow 4.It surpasses the chains it was burdened with by the ideas we all have about superhero movies: It is a spectacular, affectionate, sensitive and twisted way to tie up 20 years of Spiderman lore.Well conceived, with multiple well-rounded character arcs, great visual effects and a very emotional plot line, interlaced with interesting points about personal responsibility (not just from Spidey, but, by omission, from Strange, too) and some teasers for future Spiderman movie ideas.A new standard has been set. My new favourite Superhero is Spiderman (sorry Supes).11/10.", "One of the greatest movies ever made": "It captivated me right from the start, and I was entranced every second. There's adventure, friendship, team spirit, love, empathy, and brotherhood. If you thought the Marvel Universe had reached it's climax with Avengers Endgame, then think again, this was superb, and far more entertaining than any other Spiderman movie. Very cleverly done, mixing laughs and tears. If this is the way phase 4 is going to go then bring it on. This is the reason you go to the cinema, wonderful entertainment.", "The best, and the amazing Spider-Man movie ever!": "The actings, the dialogues and the other things, every second of the movie were great.

Something I have seen lately is the use of characters that were developed decades ago come back with age, wisdom, and a new outlook on life in present time, We all can relate, we all want a second chance to make things right, After all, life is all about growing. Spoilers- They even let some of the villains make things right. This Spider man had that.As a Film Director myself I sometimes lose the magic with many marvel films but this was one of my top 50 films of all time. It might be because of the (Spoilers) 20+ years character development having all three spider man characters together with the very believable multiverse theory which I think could be explored in many other genres.I always felt each Spider man needed closure, This really helped myself feel closure as My first Spider man was able to be apart of something bigger while sticking to the core theme that All Peter Parker's possess.I hope to see more films like this. My theory is that someday Marvel and DC will also cross dimensions, this could be decades away but a team up of studios will likely happen in the next few decades, especially if fans lose interest in each of the studios.I was lucky to not watch many trailers and only thought a few Villains where coming back. I did not expect such a star packed 20 years+ worth of characters that you could really see the magic on screen.When all three Peters hugged you felt the magic.", "Great movie!": "Had a blast watching this movie! Great nostalgic moments. Brought back a lot of good memories from previous movies!

Please avoid the spoiler to experience the best of the movie.", "Breaking the curse of the third SpiderMan movie": "This was maybe one of the most challenging movies ever made by Marvel and they over delivered. The hype was completely worth it. They gave it everything they had and it came out great! This SpiderMan breaks the curse of the \"3\". It had way more villains than Spiderman 3 or The Amazing 2 but just like the other two they nailed it perfectly.It had for me the best balance between comedy and drama of any Marvel or Superhero movie out there. The fun scenes were really fun and the drama was incredibly profound. Everything came perfectly together without overlapping or overwhelming the other genre.In the MCU this was THE movie that delivered the most. Between old characters brought back from the dead, classic characters revived after their canceled endeavors and new storylines hinted throughout the plot, they gave us A lot. Things we wanted and things we would have never dreamed about.At the end, this movie is pretty heavy and it's consequences will difficult the fluid and natural flow of Peter Parker's life and the MCU in general, but coming out from this movie, you can only feel optimistic about what Kevin Feige and Marvel are preparing for us.Greatest SpiderMan movie of all time.

Not garbage but nothing you'll watch twice": "Hard to leave a review without spoiling the movie.I'll try to keep it close to the chest here.It's starts off funny and energetic.Introduces a pretty interesting Story line and solid plot. Acting is over done at times I'll blames this on poor directing. The effects and action scenes average.Humor is delivered at times but oftentimes falls short do to the mediocre acting abilities of Several of the actors outside of veterans like Benedict Cummberbach and John Favaro. The emotional part of the storyline great concept but deflate the movie. 45 minutes or so of attempted tear jerking. Cancels out a lot of the humor and takes a lot of the fun out of this flick. Definitely think this could have been an instant classic if a few things were fixed. Hope they release an edited version.", "Why 9?

All actors have done an amazing job.This movie makes all true fans leave the movie theater emotional and proud.

There's love, suspense, fear, heartbreak, sadness, and most of all satisfaction.The reality that this movie brings to the MCU is just insane. I remember being 8 years old and watching the beginning of the super hero genre basically starting with Tobey. It is amazing to me that at almost 20 years later I can be shocked and amazed by something of this genre. Never a dull moment, Jamie Fox and William Dafoe steal the entire show!

You will love every scene and every dialogue! However, I feel that Andrew and Tobey entry could have been better. Their hype were over the roof and their entry seemed dull if you compare it with their hype. Both the Spiderman could have been introduced in between a fight scene and that would have been totally amazing and I feel there should have been more screen time of both the Spiderman. It felt like there wasn't enough time for the amazing conversation between them! But overall film maker have done a wonderful job.The reason why I am rating 10 is because of TOBEY! The movie truly deserves 9 rating. But to show our support to Tobey I am rating it 10, Sony and Marvel needs to know that we need Tobey's Spiderman 4 and it will break all the records possible. Tobey and all the fans deserves the new movie. It was because of Tobey's Spiderman, all the hype of superhero's were created all over the world and there is no marvel movie better than Tobey's Spiderman trilogy.", "It was okay": "The movie was ambitious. It appeared to want to cater to fans. It started well but ended just as an attempt to reboot the franchise. I like how it picked up right after Far from Home. I liked how they introduced Dr Strange.

I just dont understand how can green goblin beat him hand to hand combat with absolutely no combat training or abilities yet peter can catch cars with 1 hand! Come one man...\nWasnt a bad movie but the previous ones were better for sure, well the first one was the best with tom holland.If i had the script for this i would make tobey enter in black spiderman suit with the spider man 3 amazing soundtrack that would give goosebumps to everyone then have a lil sparring session to show who is the og, where andrew would stop the fight, you know just a little action, this was a f-in drama instead.Definitely not worth the 8.9rating just because of the actors.
