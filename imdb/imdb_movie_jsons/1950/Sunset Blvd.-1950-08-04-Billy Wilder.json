            "content": "Hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) accidentally falls in with faded screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She lives in a crumbling old mansion with her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim). She refuses to believe that she's no longer remembered and will never make another movie. She gets Gillis to stay with her and rewrite \"Salome\" which she thinks will be her comeback. Gillis has no other choice and things slowly get out of hand.A VERY cynical view of Hollywood--especially for 1950. It shows what Hollywood does to people like Norma--it makes them stars, tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed. It also takes swipes at directors, agents, screenwriters, even entire studios! It has a tight quick script, is appropriately filmed in gloomy black and white and is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder. Everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made. It was believed to be too cold and vicious for the public. Also Holden was warned it would ruin his career by playing a younger man kept by an older woman. But it turned out great and is now rightfully considered a classic.The acting is almost all good. I never thought Nancy Olson was that good. Her character is too pure and sweet to be believable. Everybody else is right on target though. Holden is just great in his role. You see the pity, anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes Norma is falling in love with him--and he's trapped. von Stroheim was equally good as Max who encourages Norma's delusions. Swanson however is just magnificent! She has a very showy role and could have overplayed it--but she doesn't. She's mad for sure--but you only see it peeking through every once in a while. When she loses it completely at the end it's frightening. If she had played it like that all through the movie it never would have worked. How she lost the Oscar that year to Judy Holliday for \"Born Yesterday\" is beyond me. This is a must see and a true Hollywood classic but VERY cold and cynical. A 10 all the way.\"I am big--it's the pictures that got small\". \"All right Mr. deMille--I'm ready for my closeup\".",

            "content": "Sunset Blvd. could be looked at as a thesis on what fame does to certain people.  For Norma Desmond, fame created a fantasy world that forever trapped her.  Living alone in that giant house on Sunset, save for her servant Max, Norma whiles away the hours planning her magnificent return. Her fame kept alive by fan letters, and her hope of return kindled by Joe Gillis.  For Norma, there is no other life than standing before cameras and acting out lives of characters that are larger than life.  Of course, no one knows who Norma Desmond is.  Gloria Swanson gives a magnificent performance. She runs from melancholy, to unbridled joy, to complete mental breakdown. William Holden is the ultimate cynic.  He plays Norma like a fiddle but gets ensnared in her web of decaying glory.  In the end, Joe pays the price for enduring Norma's insanity.  As she descends that staircase in the final scene, you can see that she is completely lost in her own world.  A world where no one grows old, where she is forever young, and where she is the greatest star of them all.  After all, stars never age.",

            "content": "The plot has been discussed at length in other comments.To me SUNSET BOULEVARD has it all. The comedy is sly, the drama is of epic proportions because it's not JUST a story about Hollywood or an aging actress. It's really about the giving up of dreams.Norma's dream of return, held to for 20 years, is ironic because Norma so closely parallels Gloria. That Norma cannot make a comeback in 1950 even with connections to DeMille is sad. The sadness is due to Norma's refusal to accept her aging or the politics of Hollywood that worship youth. It's ironic that Norma has no place in Hollywood (the parade has passed by) but DeMille is still working and in the scenes from Samson and Delilah we spot other old-timers like Henry Wilcoxon and Julia Faye--still working but not as STARS. The final irony here is that Gloria did make the comeback that Norma couldn't make.Norma has a thing about STARS.... she says at one point... \"the stars are ageless.\" Well this is true in a filmic sense. I can still watch Gloria Swanson in THE LOVE OF SUNYA or MANHANDLED and yup, she is ageless. She is still twenty something. That screen image is forever held up like a bad mirror to the reality of being 50. On another occasion Norma says \"nobody leaves a STAR, that's what makes one a STAR.\" True again, but it's not just Gillis who is leaving Norma, her fans have already left. Hence if one is left, one cannot be a STAR.Gillis also gives up his dream (temporarily) of being a writer, Max gives up his dream of directing, and even Betty gives up her dream of love with Gillis. Scary stuff.The film is also about LOVE. Look what these people have done for love: love of another person or love of fame or whatever. Max loves Norma. Norma loves Gillis. Gillis loves Norma and Betty. Betty loves Gillis and Artie. Artie loves Betty. And all of them love Hollywood.Everyone is crushed at the end of this film..... The scene of Max \"directing\" the scene as Norma descends the staircase is one of the all-time great scenes in a film. Norma's final speech, which sums up everything (\"there is nothing else\"), is devastating. Can she really be insane and make this lucid speech? If she's NOT insane then she has knowingly killed Gillis to prevent his leaving her (a STAR)....... Also the shots of Max blinking away tears as Norma descends (supposedly into madness) and also of Hedda Hopper crying are equally as devastating as Norma's speech about \"being back\" and \"all those wonderful people out there in the dark\" (which of course includes us every time we watch the film).I cannot think of any other film (possibly CITIZEN KANE) that works on so many different levels. And Gloria Swanson gives the greatest performance in film history!",

            "content": "I have yet to see a Billy Wilder film that I haven't loved, and Sunset Boulevard is definitely one of those films.  It's interesting to watch the film during different times in one's life \u0096 when I was a child watching this film, I thought the story was good and that Norma Desmond (Swanson) was a pretty scary lady.  In my teens/college years, I appreciated it as a certified classic and for its commentary on Hollywood.  Now, in my late 20's and early 30's I found it to have a different impact on me \u0096 I was saddened by Desmond's mental illness, and when she makes her final descent down her staircase and utters her famous line as the camera pans the faces of the people around her, so full of pity, and the care her butler/ex-husband takes to make sure she's happy for maybe the last time in her life made more of an impact on me than any other time in the 20-odd times I've seen this film. There are only a small handful of central characters in Sunset Boulevard and they are so richly written that this film will remain timeless.  There are not a lot of `dated' themes in this film \u0096 the circle of life that is Hollywood isn't going to be much more evolved in 2050 than it was in 1950. If you haven't seen this film, watch it because there is something for just about anyone in this film.--Shelly",

            "review_title": "The Hollywood Myth FOREVER Shattered !!!",
            "content": "Until 1950, American films were strictly entertainment, some deeper than others. Studio executives were very protective of image and star-making. In essence, everything seemed perfect. Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett, and D.M. Marshman, Jr. created a stunning work of art that splits the Hollywood sign in two and exposed a dream factory for what it really is: a struggle to both gain and keep notoriety in the limelight. \"Norma Desmond\" and \"Joe Gillis\" are at opposite ends of this warped Hollywood mindset, with Gillis, played by that most cynical of actors, William Holden trying to pay the rent and Norma (Gloria Swanson) living a lie as a silent queen whose star burned \"10,000 midnights ago\". How a picture with such a snide look at the industry could come out in 1950 is simply mind-boggling, considering some of the light fodder that came out of Hollywood at the time. It has inspired many modern day disciples such as Altman's THE PLAYER, and Sonnenfeld's GET SHORTY, both of which took their vicious, hilarious parodies to the jugular of the movie capital of the world. SUNSET BLVD is the father of all socially oriented pictures regarding the movies and is by far the best.The images of this beautiful black and white powerhouse are fascinating and unforgettable: the dead writer floating in a pool, eyes wide open, looking right at us at the beginning; the eerie pipe organ that plays by the breeze in the middle of one of the most deep and dustiest sets ever; the funeral ceremony of the dead monkey in Norma's courtyard (\"That must have been one important chimp. The grandson of King Kong perhaps.\" says Holden in a delightfully crisp and wise voice-over.) Holden pulls his car into a driveway off of the boulevard that will change his life forever. He is the emblem of the struggle to get notoriety. He has only a few B Movies to his credit. Swanson as Norma Desmond is the symbol of lost fame and has become the talk of legend. What is ironic about her character is that she may be playing herself in an odd way. She WAS an actual silent star whose career went down the tubes after the talkies came about. Her madness combined with Holden's last drop of naivet\u00e9 combine to give us one of the most electrifying \"give and take\" between actors I've ever witnessed.Both lead parts were passed over by several actors. Holden was eventually forced into it as a contract player. How could you pass on such a script? Even \"wax figures\" (as Holden calls them) Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner, and Anna Q. Nilsson come to Norma's to play bridge, of course being Hollywood outcasts themselves, after the invention of sound in film. Some of the dialogue takes a swing at actual movies and people (GONE WITH THE WIND, Zanuck, Menjou). This must have brought the house down in Hollywood screening rooms throughout the town. Louis B. Mayer even condemned Billy Wilder for \"ruining the industry\". The film is sad and darkly humorous depicting the antics of Norma, who is quite insane, and Holden who is going along with what Norma is giving him, but has plans of his own. Another wax figure still alive and kicking in 1950 appears as himself in an important role. Cecil B. Demille, who once directed Norma/Gloria back in the silent heyday, tries to set her straight, telling her pictures have \"changed\". They had indeed, especially after this searing comment on celebrity status. I wonder if they knew what they were creating while making this gem.Scenes are shot right on the lot of Paramount Studios (even the front gate), and Norma's mansion is an unforgettable piece of history and gloom with a floor that \"Valentino once danced on.\" There is so much to discuss, but little to enlighten you on how great SUNSET BLVD is without you seeing it. Just two years later, films began to crop up with the same tainted view of Hollywood, most with varying degrees of deception. SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, one of the all-time entertainments quietly had a nasty taste in its mouth regarding celebrity and the invention of sound movies. Watch these films closely and see the skeletons of the modern Hollywood bash films.RATING: 10 of 10",

            "content": "... how would you feel if the sexes of the characters were reversed? Suppose it was a woman writer trying to break into Hollywood, completely broke who, due to a flat tire, wanders into that big mansion. Pretty much financially cornered, she agrees to a job reworking some old film star's (let's say John Gilbert lived) script and comeback vehicle and slowly, what independence she has is taken away - her things are moved from her apartment where she is behind on her rent into a room over the garage at the mansion, her host sits by and lets her car be repossessed, she is never paid the promised cash for her work, a bad rainstorm moves her from her room over the garage into a room in the main house where there are no locks on the doors and thus no privacy, and then the seduction. Who would be the cad then?So I think Wilder meant for the audience to sympathize with Joe. Sure he makes some questionable moral moves, but he is to some degree cornered. He would have to get a hand out from somebody to go back to his job that he hates at the copy desk in Ohio, and his pride wouldn't let him. Also, some say he becomes attracted to Norma. He at best is giving her pity sex and at worst duty sex. He looks either revolted or bored every time she touches him.There are just great performances and interesting characters all around. Unpopular opinion here - I never thought Gloria Swanson was a pretty woman, but she had such severe features that she could come across as an attractive yet unhinged woman for age 50 as Norma. Eric Von Stroheim as Max. He was a great director who lets his obsession with Norma delude them both. And then there is Betty Schaefer, the down to earth girl who does the 50s thing and gets engaged to a man the way you would buy a car - she picks something reliable and likeable and omits passion from the equation. And then she finds passion. There could have been a sequel noir with her married to the dull dutiful Artie when she begins to call the mailman by his first name. The postman would only have to ring once in her case. But I digress.This is also a great look at Hollywood and Paramount Studios as it existed in 1950. It's too bad we don't have more actual films from Paramount Studios as it existed in 1950. To me this is a perfect film.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett were about the best writing team in Hollywood for more than three decades. \"Sunset Boulevard\" shows the men at the pinnacle of their profession. Billy Wilder directed the film with his usual panache at this nostalgic look at a Hollywood that had faded almost a quarter of a century before. If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading here.With the advent of the \"talkies\" a lot of film stars of the silent era lost their privileged positions as the most admired people in movies. When the new generation appeared in the scene, they were more accessible to the fans that flocked to see the new technique in the movies that came out. One of those movies stars, Norma Desmond, lives in the past as she never adapted to the new reality, which is evident in the way she stays out of the scene dwelling in her antiquated castle on Sunset Boulevard.Enter Joe Gillis, the man who never made it into the industry. As a writer, all his screen plays were rejected by the studio machinery because they were not what the heads of the production departments wanted to produce, or just were plain, not interested. Joe Gillis comes into the Desmond mansion by accident and it's an accident he encounters on his way out of it! Tbe egotistical Norma Desmond lives in the her palatial home with Max Von Mayerberg, the loyal servant, who was himself, somebody in the silent era. Norma falls for the young Gillis in ways she never expected, but as a desperate woman she wants to possess what she can't otherwise buy, even a man going through financial bad times the way Joe Gillis is.Billy Wilder got magnificent performances out of the three principals. William Holden had one of the best opportunities of his film career with Joe Gillis, a character he wasn't even scheduled to play, but which Montgomery Cliff handed to him in a silver platter when he refused to appear in the picture! Gloria Swanson, having experienced that old Hollywood, was a natural choice to play Norma, which was perhaps, the crowning role in her distinguished career. Erich Von Stroheim, the great director, himself, is absolutely wonderful as Von Mayerling.We see some of the silent era stars such as Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, Anne C. Nilsson, H.B. Warner, as well as Cecil B. DeMille, the director of Hollywood epics par excellence.The great musical score of Franz Waxman enhances the film. John Seitz black and white photography brings us back to that time. Ultimately, it's the genius of Billy Wilder that keeps things in balance showing a man who understood movies as perhaps the only one that could have directed the classic \"Sunset Boulevard\".",

            "content": "The advent of the talkies created possibly the biggest-ever upheaval in the history of Hollywood and the impact it had on the careers of a large number of the industry's popular stars at that time was enormous. Many whose voices seemed unacceptable because they were incompatible with their image or because of a heavy foreign accent, found themselves out of work as did others who were simply unable to adapt to the demands of the new era. Billy Wilder's \"Sunset Boulevard\" provides a fascinating insight into some of the more ruthless and unpleasant facets of the Hollywood system in a style that's witty, cynical and realistic and also features a number of actors whose careers were profoundly affected by the arrival of the talkies.Joe Gillis (William Holden), a struggling Hollywood screenwriter with more debts than he can handle becomes involved in a high-speed chase when he tries to avoid the attentions of a couple of guys who are intent on repossessing his car. When one of his tyres blows out, he swiftly turns into the driveway of a run down mansion and successfully evades his pursuers. After parking his vehicle in the garage, he's surprised that the occupants of the mansion seem to be expecting him. It soon transpires that they'd assumed that he was the mortician who was due to deliver a coffin in which the lady of the house's dead chimpanzee was to be buried. Joe recognises the lady as Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) a former silent movie star.When Norma discovers that Joe's a writer, she seeks his opinion of a script she'd written for her comeback movie (\"Salome\") and then hires him to edit her work. In his financial circumstances the offer of this lucrative job is too good to refuse and at her request, he agrees to stay at her mansion to complete the task. Joe recognises that Norma is a delusional has-been who lives in the past and discovers that the fan mail she receives every week is actually written by her devoted butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim). The very wealthy Norma buys Joe expensive new suits and coats and together they watch her old movies a few times each week. Even more bizarrely, on New Year's Eve, she holds a party at which there's an orchestra but no other guests! Joe feels he needs to escape from Norma who's obviously fallen in love with him and so goes to a friend's party instead.Artie Green (Jack Webb) agrees for Joe to stay over at his place and Joe soon gets into conversation with Artie's girlfriend, Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olsen). Joe already knew Betty who worked as a script reader for Paramount and the two of them subsequently start to work together on one of Joe's unfinished scripts. When Norma discovers what's going on, she becomes incensed and determined to bring their association to an end.The most striking feature of \"Sunset Boulevard\" is its sharp dialogue and numerous quotable lines which vary from the purely witty to the deeply sardonic. The fact that these lines are delivered by a screenwriter and a particularly flamboyant retired actress makes their exchanges seem perfectly credible as both characters would naturally have developed a way with words during their careers.The film's opening scene in which Joe is seen dead and face down in Norma's swimming pool is brilliantly shot and the off-beat device of having a dead man narrating the story is typical of the cynicism and dark humour that runs through everything that follows. At this point, when objectively talking about himself, Joe in typical style remarks \"the poor dope. He always wanted a pool. Well, in the end, he got himself a pool\".The casting of Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim who both had careers in silent movies, invests the events depicted with a great deal of realism as do the cameos in which Cecil B DeMille, Hedda Hopper, Buster Keaton and others are featured. Shots of Paramount studios and Schwab's Drugstore and the inclusion of an excerpt from \"Queen Kelly\" (1929) in which Swanson starred and von Stroheim directed also blur the lines between fiction and reality and add greater authenticity to the whole production.\"Sunset Boulevard\" focuses on some of the more unglamourous aspects of Hollywood and must've made uncomfortable viewing for some people in the industry at that time. Its blend of biting humour and tragedy is very effective and the performances of its exceptional cast are consistently good from start to finish.",

Gloria Swanson, however, steals every scene she's in; you can't turn away from watching her, even though she makes you really uncomfortable - it's like watching a train wreck. I don't know if the black & white was an economic or an artistic choice, but the film would never have been as effective in color. The opening shot - the floating, dead body of Joe Gillis, eyes wide open, shot looking up from the bottom of the pool - is one of the great shots, and an unforgettable opener, matched perfectly by the unforgettable closing closeup of Norma Desmond. To have Cecil B. deMille actually play himself was an inspired touch. Throw in Eric von Stroheim and you have an unbeatable combination.

He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim). Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry, and is protected and isolated from the world by Max, who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her in writing a screenplay for her comeback to the cinema, and the small-time writer becomes her lover and gigolo. When Joe falls in love for the young aspirant writer Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), Norma becomes jealous and completely insane and her madness leads to a tragic end.\"Sunset Boulevard\" is a bitter and tragic masterpiece of the genius Billy Wilder that exposes how Hollywood uses people and forgets them when they get old and are considered decadent by the industry. Further, it also shows the consequences of the lack of adaptation of a former star to the end of a successful career, being forgotten by fans and the industry, and the price that some persons accept to pay to join this business.

            "content": "The movie is still big. It's the pictures that got small. There is nothing like watching Sunset Boulevard. It's a great movie that need to be in the center of attention. Name after a Boulevard in Los Angeles, this film noir was directed and co-written by Billy Wilder who destroy forever the iconic Hollywood image with his dark tale of greed, and the lust of everlasting fame. The film stars William Holden as Joe Gillis, an unsuccessful screenwriter who happen to come upon, a faded silent movie starlet, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who draws him into her fantasy world where she dreams of making a triumphant return to the screen. William Holden is great in the role as a man struggling to keep his masculinity. I like his moral decision in the end of the film. Serve them right. In a way, this movie was indeed William Holden comeback film as well as he fallen from the starlight after 1939's Golden Boys. Gloria Swanson is scary, charming and brilliant in the Femme fatale manipulative role. She does over act a bit, but that comes with the part. She's pretty much playing an extreme version of herself. Gloria, herself was trying to have a comeback with this film, after a number of fails films, include one with Director Erich von Stroheim in 1929's Queen Kelly. Art is mirroring real life, as Erich von Stroheim stars as Max Von Mayerling, her butler and the director that discovered her. There is even a chilling theater scene with all the main characters watching the film, Queen Kelly. Erich von Stroheim is just amazing in this film, and I have become a fan of his works. I didn't like Nancy Olson so much as Betty Schaefer as I felt she was way too chirpy for my taste and in your face shouting acting. I do like the silent film stars cameos like Director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. I do like the cameo of the set of 1949's DeMille's Samson and Delilah. It makes the film seems more real to Hollywood, to know that another real life film was really taking place there. While, the characters could had been nearly unlikeable, Billy Wilder's comedy charm gives this movie some room to breathe. I have to praise the writing. It's amazing. Yes, some of the jokes went over my head, but the film was balance well enough for the drama and the comedy, not to feel overloaded. The narrative of film noirs are usually characterized as multifaceted and often confusing. It does commonly entailing the use of flashback and first-person voice-over narration. I'm pretty glad they open the film with the shot of the swimming pool, rather than having two corpses talking to each other at the morgue. I think it does sound stupid so I'm glad they use the dead body in the swimming pool idea. The corpse floating in the pool in the film's opening scene. The desired image proved difficult to achieve, and the problem was resolved by placing mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool and filming from above. The underwater shot was pretty impressed at the time. The visual effects are amazing. Sunset Boulevard uses a lot of high-contrast lighting in Norma's house that creates dark shadows that works well. The lighting and the setting is to show the character is suffocating in their life. Norma is ever looking for the light. I love the foggy blur that it create when people get near it. It's symbolism at its best. The film also contains some German-expressionistic element such as the oblique vertical and horizontal angles. For some interior shots, the crew sprinkled dust in front of the camera before filming to suggest dirty or unclean. The house was old, and nice. The way the photographs were surrounding. It look like some odd Gothic church. The house was later used by Nicholas Ray's 1955's Rebel Without a Cause. It was pretty interesting. The score was composed by Franz Waxman was pretty good. Nothing worth noting compare to today's standards. It was just OK, at best for me. Here are some faults in the film in my opinion. The narrating goes a little bit too long. Show, don't tell. Plus, how do dead-men can do a narration anyways? Aren't they dead? The whole blooming Gillis-Betty relationship seem out of place as well. I know it's needed for the plot, but it's seem forced. I just don't see Betty having much interested in a man, she barely sees. The story was a bit influence by the real life tragedy of Mabel Normand and William Desmond Taylor, in which William Desmond got shot and killed. This film marks the first time that Hollywood was view in a negative light on film. The theme of this movie is that Hollywood creates dreams and stars, and then leaves them with nothing but their own outdated fantasies. In the other side of the coin, some people are so hungry for the fame, that they are willing to do anything for a shot at it, even destroying lives. Hollywood still love and hate the film for its criticism of the movie industry. It's still a bit controversial, ever today. Wilder show us the real Hollywood where few people had success and many fails. People mustn't starve for fame too long, else they risk being trapped in a world of their own making, a world where they become bitter and delude.",

            "content": "\"Sunset Blvd.\" is the funniest movie ever made about the saddest of human conditions, loneliness.Struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) bounces around Hollywood like a pinball, flipped at every turn by the big wheels who ignore his attempts to latch onto their world. Only the repo men want his company. Then he finds himself in the mansion of forgotten screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), decked out as a memorial to someone not yet dead. Norma believes the world awaits her return (\"I hate that word,\" she says of \"comeback\"). In her effort to elude time's heartless march, she abandons sanity and bids Joe join her.Billy Wilder's film is a satire of Hollywood with a nod in the direction of Evelyn Waugh's \"The Loved One\" (Norma initially assumes Joe is here to help bury her pet chimp). As a satire it scores points, but it's as a twisted love story that it makes its mark as a cinematic masterpiece. Norma fantasizes about her comeback, but it's her love of Joe that destroys her. Everyone talks about Joe's self-loathing as a foregone conclusion of his finding himself in Norma's presence and turning himself into a gigolo, but I think he's always carrying that dislike around, his self-inflicted price for failing to achieve what he wants from life and a prison of loneliness every bit as desolate as Norma's mansion. One might wonder to what extent that, more than Norma, serves as his ruin.It's also a marvelous black comedy, both of tone and out-and-out belly laughs, whether it's Joe getting unsolicited advice in the men's clothing shop (\"As long as the lady is paying for it, why not take the Vicuna?\") or his narrating how gentle people get with a person after he's dead. Holden's especially great in his voice-over work, letting every line stick with just the right amount of emphasis, and no hint of actorliness.Swanson's all actorliness, of course, in that magnificent way of hers which provides so much of the empathy and madcap zaniness to the film. Like Gene Wilder in \"Young Frankenstein,\" she draws you in with her amazing eyes and makes you laugh and cringe simultaneously at her most emotive outbursts. It's a comic showcase from one not known for comedy, or for working in sound.Was Norma always this affected? A glimpse of her in one of her old movies (Swanson again, in her unreleased \"Queen Kelly\") shows a retrained, luminous presence not at all like the Norma we meet in the story. If this Norma played anyone on the silent screen, it would have more likely been Nosferatu. Just watch those hands of hers twist and pull, especially when she's drawing Joe deeper in her web.Norma doesn't mean to harm Joe. She just has no idea how real relationships work. To her, like mad Max her butler (Erich von Stroheim, a curiously shifting centerpiece whose true nature drives the point home), keeping people around is all that keeps her from a chasm of despair. When she talks to Joe, or addresses her imagined audience, it's not with the coldness of a user but real heart and soul. Unlike Garbo, she most emphatically does not want to be alone, and we can't help but like her for it.\"Sunset Blvd.\" makes a subtle, brilliant case that staving off loneliness to such a degree makes for a sickness all its own. I'm not sure whether or not that's the most depressing thing about the film, but it certainly adds to the power of its singular sting.",

It is because of Sunset Blvd., for certain, that my mind could ever go there. It is one of the most indelible films you will ever see.This film is great for many reasons, not the least of which is because it is Hollywood's first look back at itself. In the milieu of this film, the silent era is only 22 years behind us. The people left behind by the rush to sound can still palpably TASTE the fame, the accolade, that particular past being not so very dim and distant. The sadness of their lives was real, and at that point in history, all around, if hidden. Way more has been made of the supposed \"savagery\" of this film vis a vis the faded star than I think exists now, or ever did. The often cynical Wilder is deeply in touch with the tragic here, as much as the grotesque.",

            "content": "This is such a great film on so many levels I can't really settle on where to begin.  It is so beautifully shot (in that stark black/white that only nitrate negative could achieve), has a witty, clever and extremely well-written script, features some of the best acting in film's history, acrobatically balances the main plot/subplots with expert precision, contains some of the best characters on celluloid, has many true-to-life parallels (Swanson's career/real life cameos/DeMille's involvement/etc) and is peppered with such great dialogue/narration that today's film writers should take note.  If that weren't enough, there's even a cameo by silent film great Buster Keaton (among others).One of the most appealing aspects of this film is how, in the story, an aging, forgotten star is trying to recapture a bygone era (the silent film era).  What's interesting is that now, so many years later, we're looking back at her looking back.  To present day viewers, Gloria Swanson of the 1950's is a long forgotten lost gem and to experience her own longing for the 1920's is especially captivating (and a little chilling, I might add). I don't think this film could have had that same effect when it debuted and maybe this added dimension holds so much more appeal for today's audiences. We all know that nothing lasts forever, but we don't often consider the abandoned participants; much like the veterans of a past war.In response to the famous Swanson line (while watching one of her silent films): \"...we didn't need dialogue; we had faces\", I'd like to also add that they \"didn't need movies; they had films.\"They truly don't make them like this anymore. 10/10",

            "content": "In many ways Sunset Boulevard is like the reverse side of the coin of A Star Is Born. In that film we have young Vicki Lester going through all the travails and heartache before achieving her goal of movie stardom. Sunset Boulevard is the reverse. A Star Is Born has its tragic figure in Norman Maine who commits suicide rather than face being a has been. In Sunset Boulevard we have the character of Norma Desmond who has not taken that route. She lacks for nothing in the material world, she wisely saved and invested her money. But the acclaim of the audience is a drug she craves. She's been at the top on the celebrity roller-coaster and now is at the bottom.Into her life comes Joe Gillis quite accidentally. Fleeing from some repo men looking to take his car, Gillis drives into the garage of what he thinks is a deserted mansion. It looks pretty run down from the outside. Gillis compares it to the house of Miss Faversham from Great Expectations, little knowing how right he was.Billy Wilder was a casting genius though in some ways he fell into the cast he had. Gloria Swanson was not his first choice, he approached both Mary Pickford and Pola Negri for the Desmond role first. Gloria Swanson who actually had made the transition to sound well, but had gone on to stage and radio since her success in Music in the Air, drew from the experiences of many of her colleagues. At the time she was cast in Sunset Boulevard she had a radio show out of New York.Bill Holden was sheer serendipity. Originally Montgomery Clift was to do the part, but at the last minute he said no, feeling that this was to similar a part to the one he played in The Heiress. Wilder then went through the list of contract leading men at Paramount.Wilder saw something in Holden, God bless him. Holden had done a whole series of what he termed 'smiling Jim' roles. He was considered an amiable and non-threatening leading man. Although he had done well in a role as a psychotic killer in The Dark Past, Sunset Boulevard brought him his first real acclaim as an actor. An Academy Award nomination came with the acclaim.Nancy Olson and Erich Von Stroheim were nominated in the Best Supporting Player categories as was Swanson for Best Actress. Von Stroheim was another inspired choice. His is a strange part indeed. He was Desmond's first director in silent films and left his career behind to take care of her. He was also her first husband. Sunset Boulevard for it's time and with the Code firmly in place was a brutal look at the sexual needs of a middle-aged woman. Before Holden knows it, he's giving up his life as an aspiring screenwriter to be a kept gigolo. He doesn't like it, but can't leave it. When he does, it results in tragedy.Nancy Olson plays a reader at Paramount studios where Holden is trying to sell a script. She and Holden had good chemistry and after this they did four more films together. Casting Cecil B. DeMille as himself was of necessity for who could play the great DeMille, but DeMille. DeMille in fact was a former actor and playwright at the turn of the last century. In his autobiography DeMille lets us in on a private joke. He in fact did direct many of Gloria Swanson's early silent films and a pet name he had for her was 'young fella.' Note that when Norma Desmond comes to the Paramount lot to see him, he greets her with that same expression. Note that DeMille got a plug for his own film Samson and Delilah which was in production at the same time. It is the set of that film where Swanson and DeMille meet.You will never forget the finely etched characters of Sunset Boulevard. You can see it many times as I've done, but if you see it only once you will have it burned in your memory. Especially that last scene before the newsreel cameras where Swanson loses whatever sanity she has left. She descends down the stairs of her mansion and descends into the comfort of insanity.I've often wondered should a sequel have been done covering the trial of Norma Desmond. I'm sure Billy Wilder wanted to move on to other projects. Still that would have been a film to see.",

Wilder's script gives him plenty of opportunity to shine. His typically witty quip to servant Erich Von Stroheim is: \"I sure drove into an interesting driveway\" (after realizing Swanson intends to hold a funeral for her pet monkey). It's the kind of remark that stays with you through the entire story.Holden inhabits the role so perfectly that we can be thankful Montgomery Clift turned down the role at the last moment. And the screenplay by Billy Wilder provides plenty of other cynical and observant wise cracks that give his character of Joe Gillis such depth, conviction and truth.And, of course, GLORIA SWANSON, as Norma Desmond, in what has to be regarded as her film swansong (she did very little thereafter), is every inch the faded silent screen star who lives inside her rich imagination, inflating her ego with self-important phrases like: \"It's the pictures that got small.\" With her cat-like eyes and claw-like hand gestures, she gets every nuance out of a role that is theatrical and larger than life, right up to the fantastic ending. One can almost sense why Andrew Lloyd Webber would fashion this into a terrific Broadway musical.Her meeting with Cecil B. DeMille on the set of a Paramount costume epic is priceless for the way it is written and played. When, at the conclusion of the film, she says: \"I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille\", it's a truly poignant moment.All of the supporting players are excellent, including NANCY OLSON, as the writer girlfriend that Holden shields from the truth until that final scene where he invites her to come over to the Sunset Blvd. mansion and exposes the sordid truth of his relationship with Swanson.As the man servant who is Swanson's loyal protector and was once Swanson's first husband and director of her early films, ERICH VON STROHEIM easily matches Holden and Swanson with a fine characterization of the patiently devoted butler.Swanson plays the demented star like a more glamorous version of Miss Havisham in GREAT EXPECTATIONS, the woman who lived among the cobwebs because of a bitter disappointment when a lover jilted her on her wedding day. And like Miss Havisham, she refuses to deal with the reality of her situation when the going gets rough--as it does when it turns out nobody wants her at the studios any more, they were only interested in her antique auto.Some old time Hollywoodians get some cameos (Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner) which give the film added interest and even Hedda Hopper is on the scene as a brusque Hollywood reporter. All of the technical details are perfect. Franz Waxman's score has a Salome-like flavor, especially toward the end when Swanson is in the full throes of her delusions.Expertly photographed, written, directed and acted, this is a film that has to be watched closely to fully appreciate every detail. With its superior script, it mixes film noir, black comedy and dark melodrama with a nice blend of shadowy noir B&W photography, that has that Paramount sheen. A viewer is immediately drawn into the story which gets off to a brilliant start with Holden's brittle narration, the kind that strips all the phoniness away from any Hollywood pretension of glamor. Summing up: Highly recommended for mature adults. Holden's corpse floating face downward, eyes open in the water of the lighted swimming pool, is the stylish stuff that film noir addicts dream of.And Swanson's brief moment mimicking Charlie Chaplin is priceless.Trivia note: Holden's performance is right on target--the perfect degree of cynicism, disdain and self-loathing. He should have won an Oscar here.",

It is a bitter pill to swallow since it takes a kick at Hollywood's guts and has one of the bleakest endings in the whole of cinema.Joe Gillis, a struggling writer, finds himself in the drive of a Hollywood palazzo when he wants somewhere to hide his car.  The house belongs to Norma Desmond, who 'used to be big' in pictures, and Joe gets drawn to Norma and drawn into her weird world of flickering shadows.The acting honours in this movie go squarely to Gloria Swanson, herself a 'star of yesteryear' as Norma, who is superb as the actress living in the past.  Not that she plays Norma as exclusively tragic(the scene where she impersonates Chaplin is priceless) but perhaps no one could get to grips with the demands of this part better.  William Holden plays Joe, his breakthrough role, and he does the part very well, while Erich von Stroheim plays faded Hollywood director Max von Mayerling (naturally a reflection of himself), and newcomer Nancy Olson plays Betty, a girl too nice to become submerged just yet in dreamland's poison.The script is its moments of OTT-ness, but it is never less than interesting and draws in the viewer to the point when you are with Norma when she visits her old studio and talks of the joy of coming home; you are with Joe and Nancy as they fall in love among the cardboard settings of movie sets; and you are in the hall with Hedda Hopper watching Norma's last descent into madness.

            "content": "With a medium like cinema, which had such a distinct and holistic culture all of its own, it is bound sooner or later to lose itself in nostalgia. Either that or cynical self-parody. Sunset Boulevard is not about the way motion pictures were \u2013 it is about the way motion picture people were, and continued to be.Indeed, the style of Sunset Boulevard was the very epitome of modern film-making \u2013 voice-over narration, fluid camera-work, crisp cinematography. These contemporary trappings really serve to deepen the contrast and sharpen the disrespectful onslaught upon the olden days. Take the protagonist voice-over, something writers Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett really made an art of. It may often be functional, cutting corners in the narrative or elucidating on screen events, but more often than not it is superfluous to the story, and acts as a kind of enjoyably wry commentary on proceedings. It's a stylistic layer as much as the overstuffed set design and chiaroscuro lighting.Director Billy Wilder is often said (by Ed Sikov for example) to be someone who \"does not call attention to the shot\". On the contrary, he actually constantly grabs us with the images. While he was never fond of obvious trickery, Wilder loves the weirdness of natural effects \u2013 such as Swanson's face skull-like in her sunglasses, or the close-up on her spinning parasol which begins the bathing beauties routine. He is great at filling the shot with \"clues\" and reminders, bringing them to our attention at the right moment \u2013 such as those holes in the doors where the locks should be, which a line in the dialogue has made us associate with suicide attempts.But this is really a movie about stars, and central to Sunset Boulevard is the performance by Gloria Swanson. It was incredibly brave of Swanson to play such a brazen caricature of the kind of woman she could have become. But she brings all her long-standing talent and the knowledge of experience into the role. Norma Desmond is as much a creation of Swanson as she is of Wilder and Brackett. She has the kind of sleek, animalistic movement of a silent-era vamp, but tinges it with a frank depiction of middle-aged indignity. Her acting may be exaggerated and far from realistic, but remember she is playing a woman for whom life has become an act. Swanson is hammy because hamminess is real for that character. She clearly knew exactly what she was doing and what the pictures was about. Compare that to DeMille, who really had no sense of irony, and it's amazing he agreed to appear here. His performance is assuredly naturalistic (and ironically far better than most of what passes for acting in his own pictures), although that is also perfect for the part he plays here \u2013 being himself! Whether or not he had agreed to appear, DeMille would have been a central figure to this story. He was really the sole survivor of the silent era; the only individual \u2013 star, producer or director \u2013 from that time who was still a top dog. And although Sunset Boulevard sets its sights on the Hollywood of yesteryear, it was really the Hollywood of 1950 that Wilder and Brackett were gunning for. Like Norma Desmond, the post-war industry had passed its heyday and was really living off the receipts of its past glories. The studio system was crumbling, and TV was encroaching on its territory just as sound had encroached on Norma's thirty years earlier. It was now the more modest productions by younger, free-spirited filmmakers \u2013 productions like Sunset Boulevard itself \u2013 that were beginning to rise to the surface.",

And yet, there's a humor in all that bombastic eccentricity.And the film's theme runs deep, as it turns on its industry overlords with a stinging indictment of Hollywood suits, cruel and heartless, spitting out actors and writers when they no longer generate money. Hollywood insiders are portrayed thusly as desperate, vain, egocentric, opportunistic, shallow, and delusional, much like Norma and Joe. Indeed, the Hollywood savagery of 1950 looks very much like the Hollywood savagery of today. Thematically, the film has not aged at all.B&W cinematography captures the story's bleakness well. Sets and props are suitably specific and detailed. The film's score is at times as grandiose and majestic as Norma. And Wilder's stylistic and flamboyant directorial flourishes add to the film's supremacy.My only complaint pertains to the script. The voice-over narration is a bit overdone. And the second half plot gives a little too much attention to the Betty Schaefer character. It's Norma Desmond that I want to see and listen to.These quibbles aside, \"Sunset Blvd.\" is one of the great classic films of all time, a noir drama, wonderfully dreary and grim, yet funny, too. And that final sequence with Norma descending the staircase, addressing those around her in a mannered whisper, head tilted back, all bug-eyed and never blinking ... then as she looks into the camera ... Just terrific!",

            "content": "Widely heralded as a classic upon its initial release, the Billy Wilder-Charles Brackett production, Sunset Boulevard, is a superb piece of work in nearly all departments; and yet at some levels it disappoints upon repeated viewings. This is not an easy movie to love. The people in it are unsympathetic, as the leading male character is a hack screenwriter turned gigolo; and the woman he lives with is a mad former silent movie star who pins all her hopes on this third-rate writer's ability to write her 'comeback' picture. Neither is an amiable sort, but he is at least sane; and though he has an understanding of decency, he never quite achieves it. His goal is success. That he decieves two women who care for him deeply bothers him from time to time, when it is an inconvenience, but doesn't otherwise seem to bedevil him or prey on his thoughts. As a cynical picture of postwar Hollywood the movie is flawless. It captures the moment when the the studio system was at its absolute peak as well as at the start of its decline. The secondary characters are more likeable than the major ones, notably Erich von Stroheim's butler. Yet the film is not a satisfying portrait of mental illness, as the insane Norma Desmond, while superficially credible, has no inner life, or even a hint of one, as her demons appear to come more from her neglect by others than anything to do with herself. Her gigolo, Joe Gillis, is believable as a hustler but seems, in his narration and occasional asides, to be brighter and wittier than his behavior suggests. The characters, in other words, go through their motions, as the plot dictates; and while they are very interesting in what they do or fail at, they seem to have no life outside of the story. This is a movie about Hollywood rather than people; an immoral 'moral tale', it sometimes leaves a bad taste.For all its flaws, though, the movie works like a charm even when it is not itself charming. As Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson is magnificent, larger than life, and every inch the former silent movie queen she plays in the picture. Her final scene is priceless, and the best shot in the movie. William Holden made a new career for himself thanks to Sunset Boulevard. For over a decade he had been playing rather bland, boy next door types, and his work here was a revelation. Joe Gillis was his best performance thus far, and made Holden overnight a hot property, and shortly thereafter the biggest male star in the business. His dry, almost affectless Midwestern delivery of dialogue and, especially, narration; his mixture of good manners and ambivilant morals; and his ability to command the screen with a flicker of expression, put him immediately into the major leagues. Sunset Boulevard does not in the end tell us more about Hollywood than the Selznick-Wellman A Star Is Born, but it does its job better, with pungent dialogue, brilliant acting and a sense of style rare in movies of the time and unheard of today.",

This movie is full with references to Hollywood, as it's a story about a fading star from the silent era who meets up with a young struggling script writer.The movie has a quite interesting story, that builds on its great characters. It's a greatly cast movie, that features Gloria Swanson, an actress who more or less gloriously plays herself in this movie. She herself was an actress during the silent movie era and actually hadn't appeared in any movie for 9 years before singing on for this movie. The movie is filled with some casting like this. For instance Erich von Stroheim plays a once great director and Cecil B. DeMille appears as himself in this movie, in a quite big talking role. It's also the movie the well known line 'All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up' comes from The movie truly benefited from its great and smart casting.It's a real character driven movie, in which more and more becomes obvious about the female lead, who is slowing loosing her mind and sense of reality because she is in full denial about her fading career and glamorous stardom. Its mostly were the movie its drama is coming from, though of course there is a whole lot more going in this movie. The writer William Holden also has his own issues and there are a bunch of more different story-lines and characters that the movie involves.It's really pleasant that this movie is a fast going one. Unlike many other movies from the same time period this movie rarely has slow or dull moment in it. Yes, it's a drama but it's one of those dramatic movies that also still is really pleasant to watch.It's simply a really done well movie. It had a a great story to work with but having a good story is of course one thing, having a great movie is a totally different thing. It's no big wonder that this movie worked out so great, since it had Billy Wilder at the helm of it. He does not only tell the story great and with lots of pace but also makes the movie with a lot of eye for detail. It's also a movie with some good looking sets and costumes for instance, though initially these are not really the things you will notice first.A great movie about Hollywood done by some of Hollywood's biggest.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

I think I just assumed that I'd written a review for it or neglected to do one since it already has so many good reviews. Regardless, it's one of the best films ever--and possibly the best film Hollywood has to offer--it's THAT good.I think part of the reason I love this film so much is because it has perhaps the best opening scene in movie history. I adored the film's style and originality here. You hear William Holden narrating--narrating in a wonderfully cynical manner. And, as the camera pans down, you see a corpse floating in a pool. Suddenly, the camera is under water--and you see that the dead man is the narrator himself!! What an amazingly daring scene! And, to seemingly top it off, Norma Desmond's entrance is just sublime. But then you see that the film then works BACKWARD to explain how all this came to be--a truly wonderful style of storytelling! I could talk more about the film, but to me the beginning was THE film. Sure, Holden, Swanson and Von Stroheim were wonderful as well as Jack Webb in an interesting supporting role...but all you will probably remember is the introduction. And the directing and writing is wonderful...but you still keep coming back to the wonderful scene.The bottom line is that all would-be film makers should be forced to watch this film and learn from it. And, if such a thing COULD be done, let's also force them to watch \"12 Angry Men\", De Sica's \"Children Are Watching Us\", Majidi's \"The Color of Paradise\", and.......",

            "content": "What a movie! Boasting one of the best ever opening scenes and most remembered conclusions, with filling to match, \"Sunset Boulevard\" is a magnificently cynical overview of Hollywood, uncommonly using real names and real people for veracity.Starting with the magnificent conceit of having the whole movie narrated by a dead man, we roll back from the unforgettable shot of William Holden's corpse looking down at us from the bottom of Norma Desmond's pool in what must be the longest ever flashback in movie history taking us up to the moment of his death and its aftermath.The movie works on so many levels, taking in the hollowness of Hollywood, the transience of fame, the fear of rejection, the onset of age, there's all this and more as William Holden's kept man finds in the end he can't escape the gilded cage that faded movie goddess Desmond has built around him. The plotting is sure, the direction masterful and the cinematography at times evocative of the best monochromatic shots from \"Citizen Kane\" (there can be no higher praise), especially in its handling of perspective shots.It goes without saying that Wilder and Brackett's dialogue is brilliant with so many of the phrases entering movie legend the second they're given breath. Holden is superb as the doomed writer, closely followed by Erich Von Stroheim as Desmond's first husband now reduced to being her lackey, excusing her every erratic action out of love. Gloria Swanson goes over the top to Everest level and occasionally overdoes it, but that may have been the director's point anyway, although I think it was right that she didn't win the Oscar this year, despite being nominated and heavily tipped. It's not every film you'll see boasting Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper and Cecil B De Mille in a row in the acting credits, but while the first two get the merest of cameos, De Mille is completely natural and sympathetic to his requirement to both indulge and yet brush off Desmond's misplaced ambitions as himself.Add to the broth Franz Waxman's atmospheric score and you have the perfect recipe for a genre - busting film noir from maestro Wilder. I make it a point never to watch films more than once if I can help it but I just know there's so much more here than meets the eye, and that's more than enough for starters.",

While witty, it is savage, dark and original, and is quite simply too good to be missed. The story, while stark, is brilliantly constructed, about a former movie queen haunted by memories of her past greatness, and the script is both canny and knowing, sporting great lines such as \"I am big. It is the pictures that got small\". Billy Wilder, director of Some Like It Hot and Witness for the Prosecution, both of which are hugely enjoyable, directs briskly, and the black and white cinematography, sets and costumes are fabulous. The music score from maestro Franz Waxman is outstanding, haunting, rich yet beautiful as well.Bringing the screenplay and the story to life is the superb casting. William Holden is excellent as doomed writer Joe Gillis, who narrates in flashback from the scene of his death. Gloria Swanson though is a revelation as Norma, not only wholly convincing but also bringing a desperate and somewhat vampiric glamour to the role. Overall, Sunset Boulevard is a wonderful film, wholly deserving of its masterpiece status. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "It is among the best and most tragic exit lines in film. And it also leads directly to the best conclusion (I feel) in movies in terms of proper cinematography: the clouding of the focus as Norma Desmond descends the staircase into her madness. Rarely does a film end so satisfactorily and perfectly.SUNSET BLVD. was not the first film to look at the uncertainties of cinematic success and fame. A STAR IS BORN had done so in the in 1937. It showed how as a star is nurtured by the system to great fame, another prominent star descends into oblivion and death. So why (if the story theme was not new) was SUNSET BLVD. such a tremendous hit and classic from it's first appearance in 1950? It boiled down to this: the personal poison of the great fame of the silent screen star Norma was not mirrored precisely in the fall of say Norman Main (although their two first names bear an uncanny resemblance). Norman had always had a drinking problem which he never controlled. Norma was not into that - she was always into a healthy physical lifestyle (except for smoking), but the effect of her publicity and the fan mail pushed her egomania to great heights. It made her so egocentric that she can only think of the people around her in her immediate cycle as the greatest representatives of all those millions of unseen fans - the wonderful people out there in the dark. They are there for her adoration only. Norman Main, in comparison, did find a measure of happiness in Vicki Lester, whom he discovered and helped to find her true potential. He was more selfless, to the point (as it turned out) of self-destruction. Not really like Norma Desmond. To her people are there to serve Gods and Goddesses called stars.One might also notice that Joe Gillis is not Vicki Lester. Joe and Vicki were both ambitious, but Joe really wasn't as interested in Norma (aside from giving him room, board, and a temporary job), as Vicki was in Norman. There was a mutual attraction there (Norman was not incredibly older than Vicki, as opposed to Norma's older age compared to Joe's). Joe also had his girlfriend/collaborator Betty Schaeffer. Vicki had no other lover on the outside - it was only Norman. That is why, when he commits suicide, Vicki goes into seclusion.There is a triangular figure in SUNSET BLVD. for Norma, in her butler Max Von Mayerling. He had been her first director and husband, and he is also (in his over-devotion to her) feeding her ego by writing hundreds of fan letters to her to keep her emotionally happy. It is a sign of her insanity that she never notices that the letters are written by the same hand. Wilder had used Eric Von Stroheim in FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO as Rommel, so he knew what it was like working with him. Supposedly when Von Stroheim was being directed by Billy Wilder he wanted to throw in various tics and sexual habits for Max (like his carefully washing Norma's underclothes) which Wilder managed to push aside. Von Stroheim's performance (one of his greatest) was not harmed by these cuts, although one wonders what his performance would have seemed like if they had been retained. But by reducing the neurotic behavior of Max (to just his pathetic need to be near Norma to support her) it keeps us concentrating on Norma's psychosis - where it should be.Norma is the driving force to the end, pulling the wires that manipulate Max, Joe, Betty, even (out of a sense of pity) Cecil B. DeMille and his production staff (example: the light man \"Hogeye\"). Even with the \"waxwork\" friends who crop up for cards, Norma seems to be in control (they all congregate to see her - the richest among them). Even with people who are supposedly independent (the funeral home people who cater to her burying her pet monkey; the salesman on commission who urges Joe to buy the vicu\u00f1a coat) she manages to keep this control. She is the central sun/\"Star\" in this galaxy - and cannot brook any deviation. The rejection of the ungrateful Joe can only be appeased physically by his death, and emotionally by her mind clouding that failure and it's aftermath from her memory. From the start of the film, with all her egocentricity at work, only a psychic slap in the face was missing to complete the tragedy. Then she was finally ready for that close-up.",

            "content": "Sunset Boulevard (1950)A Love Poem to the MoviesYes, Sunset Boulevard is a love poem to the movies, to the silent era and its shimmer, and to the studio era and the beginning of the end of the Golden Age. Even if this isn't to your taste (and if not, shame on you), this has to be a perfect film. It's original and imitative, it's prosaic and profound. It moves with fluidity and visual splendor (odd to find myself preferring that word here). The main characters are so lonely and pathetic, and so deeply human and sad, you recognize yourself in them--your future self, at least.And it is a movie about love and death, about growing old enough to not know if you can be loved, and if you are loved, not knowing why. Both ways. This touches a chord for me. It comes at the end of my favorite decade for movies, the 1940s (which begins with 1939, expansively), and it comes as a pinnacle of film noir, though an odd example. It kills the main character in the opening scene and has him giving the voice-over anyway. Pretending to resuscitate an old silent screen star, played by Gloria Swanson, it actually resuscitates Gloria Swanson herself. It brings Cecil B. DeMille back to the screen, back actually on the screen, in a poignant and slightly ironic role (he plays the part of filmmaker with businesslike kindness, his sweetness genuine but also practical). And Erich von Stroheim, ever gloomy and disgruntled, but omniscient, too, the only one who seems to understand exactly why this is happening, and think it all for the best.If you are not (yet) an old film buff and have heard of none of these people from earlier eras, you can watch it as a richly filmed crime/noir/screenwriter movie (all three) with enough twists and interior monologues to satisfy even the most bored and jaded viewer. If we get past all the pre-post-modern references and homages built into the cast and plot, we can see something about Joe Gillis, a failing screenwriter played by William Holden, lost in the world, thinking he has morality and talent and even some good looks, but somewhere things have gone wrong. All he has to do is right himself, but the boat is stubborn, and only the illusion of redemption lures him out, and he begins to write even though he knows it's futile, and we know it's futile. We know in the beginning he dies in the end. Work, and working, whatever the milieu, is just that exercise some of us go through to make it to tomorrow alive, filling the days, persuading others that we're fine, that life has meaning. Such people (I'm not sure if I'm one of them) even fool themselves, because a life like that might have no meaning other than itself--the present moment, the doing as it is being done, and when it seems that the work will bear fruit--that Gillis's script has possibility--all becomes false and temporary.In this poem the heroine is unlikely and outwardly insufficient, and because of that she is perfect and more than enough--Nancy Olson, that person we really are out here in reality land, the one who is on the fringes of hope but who is, actually, happy inside. Or at least knows how to be happy--partly by dreaming, partly by taking chances, and mostly by being grounded and honest with yourself.Another aspect to watch is the insider look at movie-making. A few films swing you behind the scenes, behind the camera, and this does it during that big picture, factory feel of the studios, and though brief, it's a thrill. The fact that Norma Desmond (the Swanson character) is out of touch with it all is sad, of course, but isn't that also what life is all about, the passing of one thing and the rising of another?Who would have thought such a fantastical mind blower as this would be about the nitty gritty depths of reality? And what about the funeral procession for the monkey, coming down the stairs? My god, what a film!",

            "content": "I was a little speechless after I first finished watching Sunset Blvd. I had an idea of what to expect, but I didn't expect that a film made over half a century ago would be so sharp, so artistically compelling, and so tragic while still containing a blistering sense of humor. In some ways it was ahead of its time with its satire, ironically in a film that looks to the past with a sense of sad, but honest nostalgia. Gloria Swanson, the star of the film, plays a woman who is a star still in her old mind, Norma Desmond. There are a handful (how big the hand is depends on the particular viewer) of films where you have a character or characters that are not only unforgettable, but become so trenched in the public consciousness its hard to think of mistaking it for anything else. Even as a kid and knew that line \"I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille\" was a basic, but dead-on swipe at ego, or at least stardom. That it was in this context makes it all the more comic/tragic. That Sunset Boulevard also has the distinction of being in the film-noir tradition along with having some satirical grounding solidifies it one of the really unique films of the Golden Age of post World War 2 America.The story starts with our protagonist and past-tense narrator, Joe Gillis, who is a struggling B movie screenwriter in Hollywood. Fate, or maybe just odd luck, pits him into the driveway of a big, almost archaic estate that almost looks haunted to him on first sight. He meets Norma Desmond, whom he doesn't recognize as once being a big silent movie star. \"I am big,\" she says in one of her trademark lines, \"it's the pictures that have gotten small.\" She confides in Gillis, after he tells her who he is and why he's there (hiding out as it were), that she has a screenplay she wants DeMille to direct as her 'comeback'. He very reluctantly agrees to do it, and very soon gets sucked up into her world, becoming disconnected to his small circle of Hollywood friends. But he still has one, as a kind of secret almost, Betty Schaefer (the beautiful Nancy Olson), who is an aspiring screenwriter. One can maybe guess what might happen as this goes on, but like with Wilder's other great films, the unexpected moments and keen revelations/coincidences are the best parts; Erich von Stroheim as Max, Norma's 'butler', is surprisingly good.I've seen Sunset Blvd. several times now, but I can't forget how much I laughed the first time around; I wondered why it was even considered in the 'film-noir' tradition (not that it didn't have its stylistic or character bearings, but compared to Double Indemnity it didn't seem as pumped up). I really took it as a kind of pioneering black comedy, with Norma Desmond as the delusional, self-fulfilling has-been. For example, when Gillis first arrives and Max and Norma bury her pet monkey- it's not just the image of the dead monkey and the reverence paid to it, but also as they bury it Gillis' wry narration. The narration in this film is another great trademark, with that kind of snappy later 40's/early 50's wit that helped move from the kind of wit that was in earlier Hollywood films. And of course there are some other absurdities that bring out a few good laughs, in particular when Norma visits DeMille in the studio, and gets suddenly by some surreal miracle all the attention she's been having in her head.In repeated viewings, the film does show itself as darker, with a lot more thought put into the themes and real problems in the characters. Not just Norma, but also Joe, who little by little becomes more like the sneaky son of an overbearing mother than a real collaborator. The final scenes, which link up to the \"end scene at the beginning\", and then the sort of crazy, classic epilogue of Norma on the staircase, more of the film-noir elements come through. The 'average Joe', so to speak, in over his head; the sinister elements that are around him (more so here psychological than criminal); and of course the 'black widow' in Norma Desmong. Swanson, in what should've been her Oscar winning role, never misses a beat. Through her delusions of grandeur and overwhelming nostalgia for the old days (another great scene is when she makes him watch all her old silent films), there is also a vulnerability that doesn't make her a totally hateful character. And through all of this is one of the best screenplays that's ever come out of the Golden Age of Hollywood. As I mentioned the narration is sharp and observant, as in a sort of Pulp-noir novel, and the dialog for the time isn't very unconvincing. The relationships, like the one between Joe and Betty, is handled gently, so that the punch that's given to the viewer at the end has more of an impact. Max, as well, is maybe even more a complex character than Norma; why stay as a butler for a woman who is almost in a time warp? Perhaps he is too. Maybe that's one, perhaps subtle, message to the film- as much as it is fascinating to look to the past, to get locked into it is something very detrimental. But the film may not have a very clear-cut message, as it is a dense film with different appeals to different people (like a Kubrick film)- it's funny, it's romantic, it's sly, and at times very weird. I can't wait to see it again.",

            "content": "It may have been a bitter pill for the big dogs in Hollywood to swallow (notably an incensed Louis B. Mayer), but this striking, captivating film was and is a tremendous indictment of ageism and the disposability of stars. Holden plays a down on his luck writer whose main objective is to stay ahead of two repo men who want his car. When he turns into the driveway of a weathered mansion off the title street, he steps into a nearly surreal world of decaying grandeur, led by former silent film goddess Swanson, aided by her terse butler von Stroheim. She hires him to help flesh out her self-written return to the screen, but, before long, he finds that he's been employed to cater to other needs of hers, emotional and physical. Meanwhile, pert, dedicated Olson, an aspiring writer herself, wants Holden to assist her in bringing one of his unsold works to life. This, however, doesn't sit well with Swanson, who by now requires virtually all of his attention as she prepares to take the cinematic world by storm again. Holden, handsome and in shape (and sporting the thatch of chest hair which Hollywood frequently required him to remove!) does a terrific job in the film. His casual, understated approach is in great contrast with his co-star's, but it works well. He was a late stage replacement for Montgomery Clift. Swanson, who had herself been away from the screen for an extended period of time, is stunning. Practically every line she has is delivered with passion (and many of the lines have since become oft-quoted staples.) Her presence and her claw-like gestures combine to create a desperate, grasping, tragic woman. Von Stroheim is even more understated than Holden, but, again, it works beautifully with his stern visage at odds with the ever-emoting Swanson. The only really normal person in the film is Olson and her fresh, optimistic personality fills out the star quartet nicely. (All four stars received Oscar noms, though none took home the statuette.) Several silent film veterans appear briefly as bridge partners of Swansons including Nilsson, Keaton and Warner. Legendary director de Mille appears to great effect as himself. Director Wilder was known for his watertight, set-in-stone scripts and this is one of his best. The storyline and dialogue are fascinating and have remained so over many years, making this a solid classic. He utilized top people in every area from composer Franz Waxman to costume designer Edith Head. There were plenty of connections between the cast and Swanson. For example, von Stroheim had been one of Swanson's directors in her earlier career, as had de Mille. Swanson and Olson, however, shared no scenes in this film, nor did they when they appeared many years later in \"Airport 1975.\" It's an arresting, darkly funny, but also sad view of life in a spotlight that has dimmed almost completely. A very successful stage musical came several decades later, which gave a passel of divas (including Glenn Close and Diahann Carroll) a chance to play the role Swanson created. TV star Carol Burnett milked a parody of the movie into several very amusing and beloved skits with Harvey Korman playing her beleaguered manservant.",

            "content": "I just watched SB again -- three times -- this past week, for perhaps the 100th time.The film is virtually flawless, IMHO. (Except for the distracting shadow of the camera on William Holden's back as he moves to Norma's bed to wish her, \"Happy New Year, Norma . . . ,\" a technical flaw I've never understood: why wasn't the move re-lit and re-shot, since everything else in the film is perfect?) But what continues to haunt me is Swanson's performance. Her silent-screen \"theatricality\" is always remarked upon. Yet there are several moments of utterly contemporary \"naturalism\" that show she knew exactly what she was doing as an actress (and Wilder, as director).Her sweetness in her \"bathing beauty\" scene, where she recounts her days in the line with Marie Prevost and Mabel Normand, then leaps onto the sofa beside William Holden -- is so beguiling that you completely understand her sex appeal and warmth (for a moment). When she asks for his match (for a moustache for her Chaplin impression) and tells Holden to close his eyes, \"Close 'em!\" -- the \"Close 'em!\" is clearly an ad lib that is so real and intimate that it is almost instantly lost in the macabre sequence that follows -- all flashing eyes and volcanic eruption that C.B. DeMille himself hasn't phoned her.Soon afterward, believing she will be making \"Salome\" for DeMille, there is the astonishing montage of Norma's marathon beauty treatments in preparation for her \"return.\" Extreme closeups of Swanson's face, without makeup, reveal a still-youthful, lovely woman with flawless skin. Even under the magnifying glass, even with the \"worried\" expression of Norma Desmond, Swanson is stunningly beautiful for a few moments. Ironically, for the rest of the picture, she had to be made up to look older. Yet here we get a glimpse of the real Swanson at 50-whatever, and she looks merely a few years older than Holden.Finally, the entire sequence when Holden returns to find Swanson phoning Betty Shaefer to tell her the truth about Joe Gillis, Swanson is in cold-cream and \"wings\" to smooth her cheeks and eyes -- an actress completely exposed and without vanity.She plays the entire sequence \"naturalistically\" and in complete contrast to her theatrical, \"I AM big. It's the pictures that got small,\" style.Here, in her bed, caught by Holden, realizing she's going to lose him, she begs him, \"Look at me!\" The desperation and helplessness, the momentary admission of reality as Norma acknowledges her fears and insecurities and pleads with Holden, are heartbreaking. Swanson's playing in the scene is astonishingly courageous for any actress, and deeply true to the character.Finally, as Joe packs to leave her and Swanson pleads with him to stay -- grabbing his luggage and begging, \"What do you want? Money?\" -- again her playing is ratcheting up emotionally into madness, yet is still as contemporary as any Stanislavski method.Everyone tends to remember Swanson's over-the-top stylized performance: yet her total control as an actress, and her naturalistic moments and emotional nakedness, however fleeting, are something to behold.Swanson's is truly one of the most astonishing performances on film. Her range here is jaw-dropping.Watch her transitions in the Chaplin scene alone, in one continuous take, from heart-rending comedy to blind rage. No cutaways. Amazing.I happened to see Swanson live at the Huntington Hartford Theatre in Hollywood, on Vine, in the late sixties, in a stage show written especially for her, called \"Reprise.\" This piece-of-fluff comedy about a famous movie star returning to her home town was hardly Tony-Award winning. But from her first entrance, you were in the presence of a great actress.Barely five feet tall, she swept in and immediately established a bodily \"line\" that commanded attention from then on.Her performance was delightful. Even more so when, after intermission, the second act began with her character giving a Q&A session at the local Rotary Club.Swanson walked down steps and into the actual audience, greeting \"old friends\" (that night's audience members), reminiscing about her career -- even sitting in a man's lap and \"teasing\" him for not remembering when they \"dated\" -- as real film clips from her silents played on a giant screen onstage.She was outrageous and girlish (she was approaching 70 at the time) and delightful, poking fun at herself and her \"character's\" career.It was a brilliant bit of stagecraft and an impressive revelation of the \"real\" Gloria Swanson.Audiences were captivated and irresistibly charmed by this still-stunning-looking yet down-to-earth \"young fellow\" -- over fifty years after she first took the world by storm.Swanson was the antithesis of Norma Desmond. She was entrancing, magical, adorable, and everybody wanted to take her home.Honestly, perhaps the only other two live theatrical performances I've ever seen (and I've seen hundreds) that could compare to Swanson's sheer talent and charisma were Maggie Smith in \"Lettuce and Loveage\" and Vanessa Redgrave in \"Orpheus Descending.\" Believe it.Not every actor understands the difference between film and stage performance, nor can every actor deliver that difference vocally and physically (this was WAY before the days of amplified body mikes). Swanson did.I was in first grade when \"Sunset Boulevard\" was released. I was in my 20s when I saw Swanson onstage in \"Reprise\" in Hollywood.You could still see the magic that had made her the global phenomenon she had been in silents. You could still see the technique that astounded audiences with \"Sunset Boulevard\" three decades later.You could understand where Billy Wilder got his line: \"She was the greatest star of them all.\" Every time I watch SB, I think: \"She probably damned well was.\"",

It's about 5 0'clock in the morning. That's the homicide squad, complete with detectives and newspaper men.From that masterful opening sequence until the tragic conclusion, Sunset Boulevard maintains an example of classic film-making at its most original and revitalising level.This is one of the greatest works ever committed to film. I could stop right there and say no more. It would be justifiable...The film opens on the grounds of a run down, old mansion in Sunset Boulevard, where the dead body of a young man floats in the swimming pool. All around are news reporters and journalists, trying to capture a shot. Why? Because, the body lies in the house of an ageing film star, Norma Desmond, long forgotten after the silent era passed her by. The film revolves around the story of this bizarre, disturbed woman who was deserted by fame, her faithful butler, discoverer and ex-husband and a struggling writer who accidentally falls under her wings and she slowly, and pervasively drives him to the edge, as she becomes obsessed, fixated and jealous of any other affairs that this man has. Until, in the grand finale, she shoots him as he tries to leave her false hopes and bizarre world.This film, along with its main themes and tightly focused storyline, examines the power and corrosiveness of fame and its effects ones it leaves you. Norma Desmond is the deserted silent film queen, who spirals into madness as the world slowly forgets her day by day.Gloria Swanson, who plays Desmond is nothing short of astonishing. One of the greatest performances I have ever seen and definitely one of the best performances to be overlooked by the Academy.With outstanding performances from Eric von Stroheim and William Holden as the struggling writer, who initially finds refuge with Desmond, in this story about fame, madness and humanity. The direction by Billy Wilder is truly exceptional along with a great screenplay, a superbly suited score by Franz Waxman and creative cinematography by John F. Seitz, create an atmospheric film-noir.1950 was a good year for film. Sunset Boulevard was up against the equally recognised masterpiece All About Eve and the Best Picture was awarded to the latter, although I am convinced that Sunset Blvd. was superior. Regardless a timeless achievement and a film that is grounded in the list of the greatest films ever made.10/10",

And comparing the 2 films in terms of acting, atmosphere, dialog, conflict, symbolism, and theme (to say nothing of depth): Sunset Boulevard surpasses Kane. The ending is unforgettable and ironic:Max gets to direct, Norma makes a \"comeback\" before the cameras, and Joe has a story, his own. Like Kane, Sunset Boulevard begins with the end. The first shot is of the gutter with the film's title printed on the curb,and the first shot of Joe floating lifelessly in Norma's pool shows us he has sunk even lower: the film proceeds to show us how he got there.Sunset Boulevard is about the march of time:what time and technology does to people and what happens to those who don't or can't keep in step. And like Norma, the new Hollywood seems to be leaving Joe behind. The 2 cars in Norma's garage represent an unspoken bond between Joe and Norma; except for those cars the outside world has little use for these two. The finance company wants to repossess Joe's car and Paramount wants to use Norma's for a film.The acting is unsurpassable;the dialog and narration memorable, and the atmosphere in that decaying mansion is palpable. One of those films, like Kane, that improves with repeated viewings. Endlessly brilliant. The film hasn't aged a bit, and Swanson and VonStroheim lend it an authenticity that would be impossible for any subsequent version to equal.

The story starts backwards: you see a man floating face down in the water, and so the story begins... how it all started.Norma Desmond is a character that you hate, love and feel sorry for all at the same time... she is very selfish, self absorbed and needy. But I felt a strong pang of sympathy when Norma talks about her script for Salome... how she has such high hopes about her comeback. She just wants to be loved again. I could not imagine anyone else playing Norma Desmond.. Gloria Swanson plays it to perfection. William Holden is great also - and I didn't realize this until someone mentioned it to me, but playing such a casual, nonchalant character such as he did against such a strong character of Norma is quite challenging. He did it wonderfully and delivered the lines with ease.After watching it the first time, I watched the bits I wasn't sure of - I was sure if I liked the lines the way they were delivered - and it grew on me. For example, I always imagined the magnificent last line delivered more slowly than Swanson did it... but as I watched it again, I began to like it more and more. Now that I have watched it twice, I cannot really find anything wrong with this movie. It has it all: drama, romance, two fantastic actors, comedy, emotions of sympathy, hate, greed, lust... I would say this one of the top 5 movies of all time, if not the top.After I saw this for the first time, there was a wonderful feeling as if I had just seen a special bit of movie history... and I was a part of that history. I don't know how to explain it, but it was a great feeling that cannot be described. This can appeal to all ages, from 12 and upward's I'd say!

            "content": "SUNSET BOULEVARD will always be inextricably linked to ALL ABOUT EVE. They both came out the same year; they both star legendary actresses playing legendary actresses; they both are cynical, sometimes savage in their estimation of show business. And, of course, they are both great films.But they are very different stylistically and philosophically. A primary difference is that EVE is about a survivor. Bette Davis' Margo Channing in EVE accepts, perhaps grudgingly, that change is inevitable. Either she adapts to reality, or she loses all. That is what makes Margo more than just \"a great star, a true star.\" Margo's rival, Eve Harrington, may someday end up like BOULEVARD's Norma Desmond, but Margo Channing never will.But if EVE is about life, SUNSET BOULEVARD is about death. Even their titles suggest this: \"Eve\" being the first bearer of life and \"sunset\" being the approaching night. In BOULEVARD, Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond is to some extent already dead by the time the film starts, locked away in a haunted house, coming out only for the funeral of her pet monkey. She is bound by reputation and profession to a type of film-making that is long dead and nearly forgotten. Her life, like her career, is based on illusions of life.The prevailing interpretation of SUNSET BOULEVARD assumes that Norma is one of Hollywood's victims; that the town and the industry turned its back on her when she was no longer a star, her career sabotaged by the coming of sound in motion pictures. I don't buy that. The film clearly shows us that at age 50 Norma is still vibrant, still beautiful, still energetic and eager to make movies. Plus, she is filthy rich. This is not a woman who would walk away from movie making because she is afraid of her own voice. Indeed, her voice is magnificent; sultry, insinuating and theatrical. I don't think Norma went mad because Hollywood turned its back on her, rather Hollywood turned its back on her because she went mad. I don't think we are getting the full story here. Something may have drove Norma mad, but it wasn't talking pictures. Indeed, she may have been unstable all along, but I think there is something in her past that destroyed her, and I suspect that involves Max (Erich von Stroheim). In his \"Great Movies\" essay, Roger Ebert suggests that the love between Norma and Max, her ex-husband/ex-director/butler, is the heart of the story; that it's Max's love of Norma that validates her continued existence. I don't see that. I suspect that Max is less a servant than a caretaker or even a jailer. Max (like Joe Gillis, Norma's erstwhile boytoy) may be trapped in Norma's web, but it is a web of his own making. He appears subservient, but he is the one in control, he perpetuates her delusions and enables her madness. I even suspect that he only allows Joe into the situation because he knows that Joe is weak and no real threat to his power; and that he suspects that it will help placate Norma by feeding her fantasy of a comeback. There is more than adoration that cements the relationship between Max and Norma; perhaps guilt, jealousy, desperation -- who knows? All I know is that it is best kept as a subtext, a part of the film's impenetrable mystery. The less we understand Norma, the more intriguing she is.However, if I were to be so bold as to make one major change in SUNSET BOULEVARD, it would be to replace William Holden as Joe Gillis. I respect Holden as an actor, but his screen persona has always been one of strength and -- if not integrity -- confidence; he is not one who plays vulnerable with any conviction. Plus, he doesn't play the part of Gillis with any gentle shadings. The \"romance\" between Norma and Joe is the least convincing aspect of the film. Joe treats her with barely concealed contempt and a bit of occasional pity, which makes it hard to believe that a self-absorbed diva would even tolerate him, let alone make him the house pet. The role of Joe was originally intended for Montgomery Clift, an actor with a proven ability to appear passive, even as he plays sinister. His work in THE HEIRESS and A PLACE IN THE SUN illustrate this point. I see Joe Gillis, not as a bored hanger-on, but as sycophant who is in awe of Norma, even as he exploits her, and therefore he doesn't realize that he actually is the one who is being used (sort of a younger version of Max). I think Joe should be someone who is cunning, but naive about his own limits, not someone who is already bitter, corrupt and cynical as the story begins. Maybe I am wrong, but I get the feeling that Holden was very uncomfortable playing the part of, well, a mistress, and especially one kept by such an older woman. Perhaps his manhood was threatened and that uneasiness shows. Clift, or an equally rakish young actor like, say, Farley Granger or Robert Wagner, would enliven the story and make the romance with the perpetually needy Norma more credible. I don't think it is enough that the film shows that Norma enjoys manipulating Joe, I think it has to also be implied that to a certain extent Joe loves being manipulated. The relationship is after all a romance and to be credible as long-term there has to be the spark that it is mutually enjoyable. Holden's interpretation that Joe is just doing it for the money just doesn't ring true. While a pairing of the aging diva with an ambitious -- and yes, probably gay -- younger man is practically a show business institution. Yet, even with these reservations, it is undeniable that SUNSET BOULEVARD is quite a film. A little bit Hollywood satire, a little bit moralistic fable and whole lot of Gothic melodrama. And Swanson's just-not-quite over the top performance is mesmerizing. It was assumed that BOULEVARD would revitalize Swanson's career. It didn't. But apparently, it didn't matter to her: she dabbled in acting now and again, when the part amused her, but she had better things to do with her life. Swanson played Norma Desmond, but she lived life as Margo Channing.",

It succeeds as few movies do at drawing you in and setting an atmosphere that is both convincing and interesting.  The trio of Holden, Swanson, and von Stroheim make a fine combination, and bring their characters to life most effectively.  Aside from a couple of relatively slow stretches, it is crafted with great skill, and it's a film-noir worth watching and re-watching.Holden's restrained, gently cynical performance is an ideal way to look at the unusual world where Swanson's character, an aging former silent movie star, lives.  Swanson succeeds very well at being weird but yet believable, sometimes even sympathetic, and von Stroheim rounds out the picture pretty well as a character with his own quirks.  The physical atmosphere of the decaying mansion and its grounds, done with many well-conceived details, is also an effective and important part of the setup.  It all works so well because it comes across as true-to-life not just as a portrayal of Hollywood but as a generalized picture of living in a bygone era.When you have interesting characters, an unusual situation, a good cast, and a director like Billy Wilder to tell you the story, you have rather high expectations.  \"Sunset Boulevard\" does not disappoint.",

He can't get off the mark and leave, though he has numerous chances to do so. Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond gives the performance of the century. She is vulnerable and evil; she has the power from her wealth to keep Holden in check. Most people who portray these kinds of characters are hard to believe. She is a bundle of eccentricity and believability. And, like a little boy, he can't leave his mother. We get glimpses of his other life which seems glamorous and exciting, but he cannot give up that financial support and sells himself out; unfortunately to the nth degree. Billy Wilder is a skillful director and what he does with the black and white images (this film has to be in black and white) with the Norma Desmond poses and dreariness of her existence, just works so well.

Gloria Swanson, who plays the role, overacts and certainly is not appealing, even bordering on grotesque at times, but she isn't supposed to look good. That's one of the points of the story. Anyway, a young William Holden, in his first starring role, is okay and also provides the narration.The most interesting figure in the film to me was the ex-husband-now butler, played by Eric von Stroheim.

However, the movie deals with some interesting personal psychology as well - or perhaps - primarily.The irony of the Holden character narrowly escaping his harsh creditors only to be much further (morally) indebted in his relationship with Swanson is most funny. He engages in a relationship without true commitment. As the story goes on, he even wants to replace the love he has created with Swanson for the love of a younger woman. The classic fall of the noir male character is elegantly underway.The Swanson character is not evil. The murder she commits is not committed in cold blood, but as a result of the betrayal and lies of people she thought she could trust. I.e. Holden and the too kind director who does not have the courage to tell her the truth about herself.When Holden's true intents towards Swanson are revealed the punishment is immediate, but of course, on her part, well over the limit. The development of his character in the movie is, however, more interesting.I find the \"kill-and-be-famous\" ending of the movie to be a bit unnecessary even for the cynical story. It is true that a murder would probably be the only way for Wilder to convincingly dust off an old star and lead her back in to the fame light. Thus, however, Wilder chooses to prefer the theme about what leads to personal fame to the theme about betrayal of an indebted man and its consequences. The two themes do hardly float together like blood and water, even in a film noir, at least not in this one. It is great, though.",

I didn't throw my gum away like Gillis does, but still, I did feel a little disconcerted. Norma Desmond knew I was chewing, and she didn't like it one bit.But this is part of Sunset Boulevard's charm. While it's a movie about the ways movies had changed, were continuing to change, and those they left behind, it also shows us how, in some ways, they've remained the same. Its references to the WGA, popcorn cinema, and the tragicomic nature of washed-up celebrity feel oddly contemporary while simultaneously being firmly rooted in the Fifties.While some of the period references to actors and directors went over my head - I'm no expert on the silent era - it didn't affect my enjoyment of them one bit. The fact that Wilder and his team were brave enough to include such comments gives the film a cool, relaxed feel even as the web that binds the characters draws ever-tighter.It's fantastically acted too. Holden is brilliant as the struggling everyman who quickly realises that he's gotten way more than he bargained for, and Swanson is pitch-perfect as the faded screen star whose grip on reality has crumbled far quicker than the walls of her mansion, right down to the wide roving eyes and claw-like hands. They're well-supported, especially by Erich von Stronheim's eerily restrained butler Max.Of course, great dialogue and performances are nothing without a plot to match. Despite the fact that the beginning reveals the end, Sunset Boulevard still manages to keep you hooked from the moment Holden sits at his desk for the first time right up until the movie's cruel, haunting, tragically human conclusion.Very rarely do \"old\" movies actually live up to their reputations, but I'm pleased to say that Sunset Boulevard does, and it's a credit to Wilder's team's ability that this noir-drama stands the test of time.

Parallels exist throughout, including the enchantment.Consider:1) A man compelled to stop for the night, as did Joe Gillis, whose face showed his puzzlement and hesitation upon viewing Norma Desmond's estate on Sunset Blvd: \"This could be Heaven, or this could be Hell.\"2) \"Then she lit up a candle...\" Norma lit many.3) \"Her mind is Tiffany-twisted,\" as was Norma's, and, \"she got the Mercedes-Benz.\" Only in Norma's case, the Isotta-Fraschini.4) \"She's got lots of pretty, pretty boys that she calls friends.\" Norma had gone through three husbands and lured Joe into an intimate friendship.5) \"How they danced in the courtyard...\" Joe and Norma danced in the great room.6) \"Some danced to remember\" (as did Norma); \"some danced to forget\" (as did Joe).7) \"So I called up the captain, 'Please bring me my wine.'\" Max Von Mayerling served as butler/wine captain.8) \"Pink champagne on ice.\" Lots of champagne consumed in the film.9) \"We are all just prisoners here of our own device.\" That's the theme of the movie! Every character is trapped in his and her own way.10) \"Last thing I remember, I was running for the door.\" Joe did also to \"find the passage back to place I (he) was before.\"11) Finally, \"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.\" Precisely the fate of Joe.If this fine film didn't inspire other artists, I'd be very surprised. It adroitly captured the mood and seductiveness of Hollywood and California of the early '50s.",

            "content": "Film Noir, as it was filmed in black and white in the late 40's, early 50's is divided into three distinct categories. For the lowbrow, there is the brilliant Detour, so primitive and shot so cheaply, yet delivering a massive result. Then there is The Big Heat with Glenn Ford, a middlebrow film with the dark shadows, tragedy, and cynicism of Noir. Finally, for the highbrows, we have Billy Wilder's finest film, a true landmark dripping with edgy cynicism by a man that lost his parents to the Holocaust.In Sunset Boulevard, William Holden gives his finest performance. Holden is a very likable man and that comes through on the screen no matter which role he performs, but always that All-American persona, that likability leaks to the screen. Part of this quality is his obvious intelligence. As Norma Desmond's kept man, he knows it's wrong, at times it's downright creepy, but he works with Billy Wilder's vision and melds a bizarre group of Hollywood types into an indictment of the industry up to 1950.Are exploitation, money grubbing, and the status quest pertaining only to the early era of Hollywood? I don't think so. Ha, ha, ask Jessica Simpson, Jana Jamison, Michael Jackson, adnauseam.Gloria Swanson is a great actress. She lures Joe Gillis like a black widow spider. Her delirium is a cross between silent movie actress and Betty Davis in What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? Perhaps Davis got the idea from Gloria's earlier film. Curiously, Betty's 1950 picture All About Eve won the Oscar. It is a fine film, but SB scared the studio heads, indeed horrified them, and the picture was passed over. Anyhow, this was a comeback for Swanson and she went for it. I don't know if she did a lot of work after this film, but it solidified her reputation as a Prima-Donna film actress. Her performance is unforgettable.Also kudos for Erich Von Stroheim as Max, Nora's butler, ex-husband, and first director. Stroheim indeed was a fine silent film director and remarkable in Renoir's Grand Illusion. This fellow looks like he was born to wear the Kaiser's helmet.Finally, Nancy Olsen, pulled from obscurity, a college girl from Wisconsin, she is lovely as Holden's inspiration, and love interest. Her wholesomeness certainly contrasted with all the other grubby Hollywood types in the film.I have seen thousand's of films; many are of very high quality. I can't rattle them all off for you, but SB is in the top 25. Think about that!",

            "content": "Do you want to be disturbed?Are you ready for a clammy, ice-cold classic that's relentlessly sad, chilling and upsetting? Try SUNSET BOULEVARD.Where else can you find a movie that starts -- actually starts -- with the main character being dragged out of a swimming pool dead? And then, the poor dope spends two hours telling you how he lost his job, his career, his girl friend, his self respect, and his life. But he got that swimming pool he always wanted.It's horrible to watch Joe Gillis lose everything. William Holden gives his character so much smarts and charm, you just can't believe he can be snuffed out so easily. But that's what Hollywood does -- and the message is that if it can happen to Joe, it can happen to anyone.On the other hand, Norma Desmond is truly a fiend out of hell. Gloria Swanson will never be equaled in her courage, playing a woman who is more repulsive and hateful than any modern serial killer or hatchet wielding maniac. And yet all she wants is to go on being young and beautiful forever, sharing the magic of her stardom with \"those wonderful people out there in the dark!\" And the message is, if this monster is what's in front of the camera, who knows how many other monsters are out there -- in the dark? At the heart of this movie is an intriguing contradiction. On the one hand, the chilling madness of Norma Desmond is as real and modern as the ghastly antics of the late Michael Jackson. (Funeral for a chimpanzee, anyone?) On the other hand, the anguish of Joe Gillis at being \"kept\" by an older woman is almost (and I do mean almost) too sexist and out of date to keep the viewer involved in the story.Consider how this story would play if the gender roles were reversed. What if Norma Desmond were a tough, male Western star of the silents -- someone like legendary stuntman/cowpoke Tom Mix. And what if the young screenwriter were a pretty young woman with a cheerful, irreverent, upbeat personality, sort of like Carole Lombard or Katherine Hepburn? If the two of them got together it would seem sweet, romantic, not repulsive and chilling. Particularly if the eager young female helped him to get over the death of a beloved wife, or maybe his horse.The point is, no one would be horrified if a 50 something male star seduced a bright young woman in her late twenties or thirties. In fact it would be regarded as rather romantic by a lot of people.A lot of the \"horror\" of SUNSET BOULEVARD comes from an unthinking assumption -- that women with money and power are unnatural creatures and that they can only attract younger men through evil and manipulation. And there's also the double standard that a woman over 50 is no damned good to a man, but a man over 50 is still in his prime.One final thought: William Holden had a wonderful career well into his seventies, and deservedly so. One of his last great performances was in THE WILD BUNCH, where he plays an aging outlaw named Pike Bishop. Note that Pike has the same basic concerns as Norma Desmond. Have I outlived my era? Can I still command respect? What was my life worth? Yet Pike's struggles to pull off one last job are not only not laughed at -- they're rendered as poignant, admirable, and unbelievably heroic. Pike plays the kind of noble, courageous life-giving elder whose wisdom and humanity -- and even his violent tragic death -- simply serve to rejuvenate an entire community.That's the kind of part a mature actress should be able to play as well!",

            "content": "Spoilers. Sometimes lousy movies can be redeemed through means of a plenitude of epigrams sprinkled on the script. This one has all the classic tag lines. \"We had faces then.\" \"I am still big; it's the pictures that got small.\" \"Ready for my closeup, Mr. DeMille.\" \"The audience doesn't know that someone writes the words; they think the actors make them up as they go along.\" And some lousy movies have little, barely noticeable touches that redeem them. Gillis storms out of Norma Desmond's house on New Years Eve after an argument, leaving his kept existence forever, but his long watch fob gets caught on the doorknob as he exits. (He'll be beck.) Norma visits a set on the Paramount lot for the first time in twenty years and, asked to sit and watch a rehearsal, the microphone on its boom brushes against her feathery hat and she shoves it away with irritation. And that last devastating dissolve.But this movie doesn't need that kind of redemption. The script -- the entire film -- is a classic that stands on its own two feet. Gloria Swanson's performance is overblown, as it should be. Von Stroheim -- or, let's call a spade a spade, plain Stroheim -- brings to his role the starchy oblige that he showed in \"Grand Illusion.\" Holden will be remembered probably for three roles: \"The Bridge on the River Kwai,\" \"Picnic,\" and this. Brackett's script is well above average, even with its use of a voice-over, given by a dead man. Pat Olsen is mouth wateringly beautiful. She went on to make several other movies with Holden, none of them as good as this. The photography and art direction also stand out. This is one REALLY rotting mansion. Everything is out of date, from Buster Keaton to the tiny roach clip Norma Desmond wears on her finger when she smokes.Amid the bizarre melodrama there is one quiet, simple scene I always find appealing. Holden and Olsen are on a dark, deserted city street on Paramount's back lot, and she tells him she once had her nose fixed. He playfully leans down, examines it, and kisses it lightly. Then he backs away a few inches and warns her never to let him get closer than two feet. If he does, she should hit him with her shoe. Holden never indicates more than a momentary physical attraction, combined with a realization that he'd better not push the envelope. He later tells us he's \"crazy about her\" but we don't believe him. But in this effective and signal scene, Olsen's expression never changes. Her smile is sweet, agreeable, alert, and curious -- without in any way welcoming more intimacy. It all sounds rudimentary but it's tough to put this kind of exchange over and both performers do it splendidly. The story is elementary. Gillis, a failed screenwriter, is adopted by Norma Desmond, a rich but forgotten star of the silent days (\"Oil wells in Bakersfield -- they keep pumping and pumping and pumping\"), and he succumbs to greed, letting her buy him vicuna coats and \"evening clothes\" and whatever, in return for which he supplies the only thing she needs and he has to offer. But he doesn't do so without loathing himself. And when he falls for another girl, he decides to reject everything, Norma and girl friend and vicuna coat included, and go back to Dayton, Ohio. He doesn't make it. Everything about the story, Gillis's death included, is comic in a way, acerbic may be better, but very dark too. Wilder could be a phenomenally good director when the right script came his way, and this is an instance.",

            "content": "\"Sunset Boulevard\" is a film for ages, since its main topic is relevant today as it was in the day when the movie was made- how to deal with the fact that one is past his peak and what a devastating effect it can have on people who are used to fame and fortune, once they face the fact they no longer front page material. Here, Swanson plays a silent film diva Norma Desmond leading a secluded life in her mansion, almost a metaphor of a princess in a tower. And lo, unexpectedly there comes a prince about to save her, in the form of a failed screenwriter Joe Gills (Holden) who is on the run from his creditors. Learning that the former diva is completely out of touch with reality, he moves into the villa pretending to help her with the script for her grand comeback. He also learns that her butler Max enables her delusions by writing the letters she believes are sent by her fans. Eventually, the charade is exposed and things get out of control.This is arguably Swanson's biggest accomplishment and she deserved all the accolades she got for it. Her portrayal of a woman refusing to face the music borders on hysterical and paranoid all the time and she dominates every scene she's in. It's a lesson on character inhabiting and Holden also does his bit by giving the audience a cool, detached narrator framing the story of his own demise. Erich von Stroheim shows just how far one is willing to go to protect the woman he loves, creating a web of lies and illusions to keep his love sane. Put any other aged movie star into Norma's shoes and you'll get a similar story. The ending scene is a masterpiece.",

That is a brave statement after watching more that 3.000 movies in my life, but after first time seeing \"Sunset Blvd.\" only today in 2015, i was blown away by it in every sense. This is a movie making at its very best. The real star of this movie in my opinion was the script. Every sentence in this movie is great, it's lead up to something, and it fully engages you in this movie. The story itself is very simple, yet the script makes it astonishing. There is not one boring or uninteresting line in this movie - this has to be of the most polished scripts in the history of cinema. Acting is superb by all involved, but the best comes from Gloria Swanson. Maybe it is a bit overplayed here and there, but this is how aging and narcissistic movie star from ~ 1930 was interpreted in 1950 - this is superb performance. Music, cinematography, directing - they are first rate here.Overall, \"Sunset Blvd.\" is a movie must be seen by all movie lovers. The movie itself is like a love letter to a movies itself and those who loves watching them. All in all, this an amazing motion picture, were everything works and at the running time 1 h 50 min you just want it to continue - it perfectly paced and not overlong. If you haven't seen this gem yet, do your self a favor and see it, don't afraid that it was made in 1950 and it's black and white - this a spellbinding motion picture.",

            "content": "Usually, Cinema is considered as the most delicate form of art because it has the biggest potential to become 'dated' one day. Once a movie thought as 'mind-blowing' can easily become a 'turkey' a decade later.This is not the case here. Sunset Boulevard still remains as one of the most eerie film in the cinema history and still a realistic depiction because of its reflection of Hollywood. It can give you the idea of the dream land's transformation into a nightmare.The film is about a troubled script writer 'Joe Gillis and a forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond's weird relationship and the madness that surrounds them and the people around them. Don't wanna give much of the plot, on account the fact that it is a pure gem that should be invented without knowing nothing. But I can talk about the cinematic aspects of this movie.This movie has some very eerie moments because of using a great cinematography. The moments of burying the dead monkey and watching the old film of Norma Desmond are exquisitely presented. The movie has some one of the most innovative scripts of cinema and that is certainly justified by the unforgetable and memorable lines captured from the film. The directing is top-notch but who are we kidding it is Billy 'the great' Wilder. The end of the movie is one of the most chilling part of the movie and it can truly give you some nightmares about insanity. The narration of the movie by the head character was probably done by this movie at the first place and this influenced so many movies afterwards.One of the reasons that this movie is still not dated is because of its courage. The Hayes code was at its peak at the beginning of fifties which manipulates the producers to limit their bad thoughts on one subject, especially on Hollywood. The movie got 11 oscar nomination but only got 3 of them. Apparently, the reason was its harsh criticism on Hollywood.There are some arguements about Sunset Boulevard's genre. It is considered as the greatest film-noir of all time. I don't think it is a film-noir at all. For some aspects, the movie has some noirish elements such as the black and white German-expressionist cinematography and an 'on the edge of insanity', femme-fatale but these two are not enough to make a film-noir. I think this is a psyhcological drama with some horror(the end is horrifying for me) and with some very very dark comedy.Overall, This is truly a classic and one of the best movies of cinema history that will never lose its effects on cinema. Heavily influences American Beauty and Mulholland Drive, also making those movies a must see. 10/10",

But, alas, although he can produce a script in a very short period of time, he has no luck in selling any of them to the studios. He's borrowed money from everyone he knows and, now, his car is on the point of being re-possessed. In fact, on one critical day, the repo men are waiting for him and only a bit of quick thinking on Joe's part delays the inevitable. Joe's tire blows and he makes a sharp right turn into the driveway of an enormous mansion. Seeing that the garage door is open and near empty, he sneaks his car into the building. Before long, a servant named Max comes out to greet him and invites him in, thinking Joe is there to see the lady of the house. SHE is silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who is very wealthy and reclusive. She also may be slightly touched in the head, for as she shows Joe around the place, she asks him to arrange a funeral for her monkey! Needless to say, the mansion is filled with photographs and other objects from her glory days. As the conversation continues, she discovers he is a screenwriter and she immediately asked him to help her with a script for her big comeback. That would be the role of Salome, where she will dance and end up with the head of John the Baptist. Having really nowhere to go and no money, Joe agrees. He is given rooms over the garage. However, Norma wants more. She falls for Joe and the younger writer becomes sort of a \"kept man\". This is degrading and humiliating for Joe but he likes the caviar and new clothe, after all. But, with there being little chance that Norma will ever make another film, how does Joe go on in this arrangement? Here goes, folks, are you ready for your close-up review of Sunset Boulevard?This classic film by master storyteller Billy Wilder is a must-see. First, the two main stars, Holden and Swanson, are near perfect in their roles, with all of the supporting cast darn wonderful, too. Watch for cameos from Buster Keaton, Cecil B. DeMille, and others. Then, the story starts at the end and back-ups, an intriguing arrangement. Filled with memorable lines, stunning costumes, great sets, and a fantastic direction, one could hardly ask more from two hours of entertainment.

Basically, this is a story  about a failing screenwriter's accidental encounter with Norma Desmond who still lives in the past with the household staff playing along at every beat. He then becomes entangled in her web and has to fight himself out of her grip, but struggles with this because he is being taken care of financially and socially.

            "content": "Nineteen-fifty proved a spectacular year for Hollywood.  The studios enjoyed maximum power and influence, following a decade of unprecedented numbers of ticket-buyers.  Never again would `The Industry' ride so high, with (among other factors) the advent of television.  And three movies released that year have attained almost scriptural status, at least among acolytes sharing a rarefied if rigorous cinematic faith: All About Eve; Caged; and Sunset Blvd.  All three glitter with brilliant epigrams flashing from the polished facets of their gem-like scripts - lines that have entered the language at large, often quoted in ignorance of their provenance.All About Eve was a theater story but Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd. was THE Hollywood Story.  (Caged was a women's prison story; enough said.)  And it is as a myth about movie-making, and the erratic trajectory of stardom, that Sunset Blvd. most frequently merits attention.  But of many movies made about Hollywood, none can claim the peculiar potency of this masterpiece, which can still wring from viewers those old Aristotelian emotions of pity and terror (plus a good deal of unholy fun).Its corrosive force springs from the fact that Sunset Blvd. is, first and foremost, about that oldest and deepest of human preoccupations, gender. It tells of catastrophic upheaval in the long-honored `natural' order of affairs between males and females: A virile young man falls prey to an older, more powerful woman.  His tragedy is not the watery end into which he plummets but the slow and painful process of emasculation to which he has given tacit consent.Ohio newspaperman Joe Gillis (William Holden) went west to make his fortune writing pictures, but he works in his bathrobe in a one-room apartment three months behind in the rent.  His car payments are in arrears, too, so his attempts to elude repo men become the fuse that ignites the plot.  A fatal turn takes him into the driveway of 10086 Sunset Boulevard, the Gothic manse where, in wealthy if stifling seclusion, lives legendary queen of the silents Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She grants him asylum, in his view a temporary convenience.  But she has other ambitions.At first those plans seem to be a rather hopeless pipe-dream about returning to the screen, through the vehicle of her screenplay Salome (another cautionary tale of reversed gender roles).  But soon the resourceless Gillis finds himself accepting her largess (a garage apartment, vincuna topcoats, a gold cigarette case inscribed with \"Mad about the boy\") and her control (from `And must you chew gum?\" to `Of course you didn't - I wouldn't let you').  Once Desmond sinks her talons into him - and Swanson's own stint in the silents pay off handsomely, for no one in the sound era ever deployed claws like hers - he finds he cannot leave, even at the cost of his self-esteem and greater happiness.The third character in the movie offers a dress rehearsal of the submissive role Gillis is bound for.  Desmond's Teutonic butler Max (Erich von Stroheim) caters to her every whim and guards her castle of illusions.  In a role suggestive of the male - and generally gay - assistants, publicists and fans who cluster dotingly around female stars, he fusses over girlish details (`Madam will pardon me, but the shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced\").As the movie charts its inexorable course, new humiliations and revelations strip layer after layer from Gillis' own illusions.  In a chic haberdashery where Desmond takes him to smarten up his wardrobe, a clerk whispers, \"Well, if the lady is paying, why not take the vicuna?\"  (Holden wordlessly reacts with rage and shame.)  And when he sneaks back from what Desmond suspects is a night of tom-catting - he's actually writing a script with a young colleague (Nancy Olson) who's falling for him - the vigilant Max lurks in wait for him.  Challenged by the fed-up Gillis, the butler reveals not only that he discovered Desmond when he was the great auteur Max von Mayerling (Stroheim, of course, was a grandiose director of the silent era), but that he was \"Madam's first husband\" as well.   In the hard-as-ice script by Wilder and Charles Brackett, this stands as, hands down, its chilliest moment.  (By contrast, its sunniest involves Desmond's return to Paramount studios, when a light swings upon her so a new generation of actors and crew can pay homage to her glory.)Sunset Blvd. catalogues the kept-man's degradation to which Gillis acquiesces.  He's moved from chauffeur's quarters to the lavish suite adjoining Desmond's - and from which, owing to Madam's \"fits of melancholy,\" the locks have been removed.  He endures the raised eyebrows of Desmond's bridge partners (Anna Q. Nilsson, H.B. Warner and Buster Keaton) when he interrupts their game to ask for money.  He finds himself as the sole guest (apart from Max and the orchestra) at her New Year's Eve soiree, tangoing on the tile Valentino told her to install, where she finally confesses her love for him.  (As though he never expected this development, he storms out to a raucous party among his young former friends, only to race back after she swipes his razor and succumbs to her melancholia.)  He even lets her towel off his bedewed torso after a dip in the pool she has had filled for him.Desmond, in a nutshell, has taken a scalpel to his manhood long before the final denouement - precipitated by one final, doomed bid for freedom.  And perhaps he prefers the end that he must know awaits him to taking a bus back to Dayton with his tail tucked between his legs.  But fate proves `strangely merciful' to Norma Desmond. In the movie's last, most iconic scene (`I'm ready for my close-up, Mr. DeMille'), she once again triumphs under the harsh lights and in front of the clattering cameras.  The full fetch of her looniness at long last unleashed, she gets what she wanted all along: not the boy she was so mad about but the \"return,\" however delusional, she craved.",

By today's standards, this 1950 film still takes some relevant shots at an industry that seldom acknowledges its superficiality, but is also just as dated in other regards. Wilder takes a truly original concept, bending Film Noir, satire, comedy, and pathos in the telling of Joe Gillis (William Holden), a down-on-his-luck screenwriter (the repo men are threatening to take his car, for Pete's sake!), who winds up all but imprisoned in the lonely, secluded mansion of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a washed-up silent-film starlet harboring delusions of a comeback. When drafted to revise Desmond's self-scripted version of \"Salome,\" Joe becomes very aware of his unhinged provider, and quickly begins a collaboration with the young, rhinoplasty-friendly Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson). While Holden and Olson are--in the midst of this send-up--fresh-faced stars, \"Sunset Boulevard\"'s axis of madness hinges squarely on Swanson's full-bore performance, a blend of incestuous sexuality and mid-life crisis (she makes Baby Jane seem warm and cuddly by comparison) that makes her advances on Holden genuinely unappealing. The performance is a bit more tricky than one might give credit--as a woman whose fame has declined, her sustained hunger for it fuels her delusion, therefore rendering Norma Desmond an actress who literally acts out her everyday reality, to the point where any semblance of humanity is absent (her actions and words possess the overt dramatics of a woman seeking the Best Actress Oscar). While the film is beautifully photographed and performed, the sheer ambition of the project is something of a flaw--with so many genres represented, \"Sunset Boulevard\" is problematic in synthesizing a coherent vision. But what is here is quite influential, and certainly worth a look.",

Erich Von Stroheim plays the loyal house servant Max Von Mayerling to Norma Desmond.A combination film noir, satire with dark, cynical humor, \"Sunset Boulevard\" excels. Being narrated by a dead man is a nice dark touch. There are cameos of several famous silent film stars including Buster Keaton, who play themselves in the film. Most notably, Cecile B. DeMile plays himself, who directed Gloria Swanson (in real life) in some of her silent films. The film has a romance substory that is done well. I believe this substory really serves as a distraction from the film's dark cynical tone.Both \"Sunset Boulevard\" and \"All About Eve\" are two excellent films of the same year (1950). Both were nominated for Academy Awards in many categories including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress. Both films had similiar stories. To decide which film was the best film of 1950 was truly difficult and shows the folly of the Academy Awards. Both are excellent films (in different ways): most notably for writing and acting. \"Sunset Boulevard\" has the advantage of better cinematography for it's film noir, moody look and feel. \"All About Eve\" does have a \"stagey\" look and feel to it, using basic and simple cinematography. Both films excel with similiar stories, done with different tone and mood. \"Sunset Boulevard\" stands the test of time as a classic film, perhaps better understood and appreciated by film buffs, nonetheless, one of Hollywood's best films.",

It can easily be called a masterpiece, but is it an entertaining movie? Great to see Hollywood circa 1950, with Schwab's Drug Store still there, but it's sad to think that even in 1950, stars were being discarded, replaced by the new and the younger, and even a star like Norma Desmond couldn't get a picture made. Thank goodness she had those oil wells in Bakersfield (\"Pumping...pumping.\"). There's a lesson to be learned from the film: invest! *** from ****",

Billy Wilder tried harder than any of his other film while making this one and it sure shows.The story of the aging film star that still lives in the past was something like a tribute to an era that even in the 50's had long lost its luster. Gloria Swanson in the best role of her career plays Norma Desmond, the silent screen star who is in the process of writing a script for a film to be directed by Cecil B DeMille, or at least she believes so. Norma entails the help of a younger man named Joe Gillis (played by William Holden), who in a bit of desparation of his own, decides to alter her script for her in return for money and a place to live.The haunting mansion that Desmond lives in with only her butler Max (Erich von Stronheim) shows only pictures of her, has a screen onto which her films are shown to her weekly and plays host to other former silent film stars (notably Buster Keaton in a surprise cameo), is a reminder of how time passed Norma by. Norma tries, though in vain to make Joe love her as she loves him. She even goes through the trouble of having a small orchestra play all night on New Year's Eve just for the two of them. When Joe asks when all of the other people are going to arrive, Norma responds \"this is a special evening, this is our evening.\" From here on we see to what lengths Norma will go to show Joe how much she loves him, regardless of the fact that he does not love her.Joe is eventually approached by a script reader, Betty, (Nancy Olsen) that finds some potential in one of his older scripts and offers to work with him to bring it up to par. The only problem is the close grip that Norma has around him. Joe knows that he can only sneak away at night since Norma doesn't want him to be away from her for any amount of time. Joe leaves frequently to work with Betty, all the while falling in love with her.The tragic ending in this film reminded me of the one in \"The Great Gadsby.\" It is another example of love gone wrong when a man should have been with the girl he loved, however, the circumstances he is in simply won't let him.I fully enjoyed this film and would recommend it to all. This film is truly one of the all time greats.8/10 stars.",

Much like when a person walks around ancient Rome or Egypt wondering how something so powerful and advanced could come to an end.

Holden as Joe Gillis a rapidly becoming down on his like screen writer who stumbles into Swansons world is fantastic.

            "content": "From the very beginning of this film, with the external shot of the corpse floating in the outdoor pool, the audience gets sucked in.  Sunset Boulevard is a fantastic example of artistry gone horribly wrong and selling yourself out for the betterment of yourself.  All four main characters, Norma, Joe, Max and Betty are definite characterizations of four different types of person in Hollywood. Norma is of course the faded silent screen star so desperate upon making a comeback that in essence it just kills her and everyone around her.  Joe is the down and out, very desperate screenwriter who stumbles upon Norma and falls head first under her spell.  By the time he gets sucked into her web, it is almost madness as to why he cannot extricate himself from her grip.  Max is the humble butler, who unlike so many other people has come crawling back to Norma because he simply cannot live without her.  So, in essence he takes a menial job just to continue to stay with her in one form or another.  Betty is the one ray of sunlight in an otherwise dark and foreboding world that threatens to crush anyone that gets ensnared in it for too long (i. e. the Hollywood system).  But even so, her light is almost snuffed out towards the end of the film.  We never really get to see what happens to her afterwards.I think what makes this film so great is its ability to wear its heart upon its sleeve.  It is an unflinching portrait of what Hollywood once was (and is no longer) but some of the vestiges from this film can still be seen today.  The bitterness and the knife-edge cynicism (not to mention the acting) is what, I think, draws so many people back to it for repeated viewings, myself included.  For even if we've seen this film before, we can always see it again and pick up on certain things that we never noticed the first time around.  For example, the home that the filmmakers used as Norma's mansion was also used a few years later in Nicholas Ray's Rebel Without A Cause. Gloria Swanson gives a heart-rending performance as Norma Desmond, the silent screen star so desperate to make a comeback.  This film was sort of a \"comeback\" for her, having been out of the public eye since the early thirties.  She albeit succeeded but however, she failed to win the coveted Best Actress award at the Oscars that year (1951).  The prize even eluded both Bette Davis and Anne Baxter from All About Eve and went to newcomer Judy Holliday as ditzy blonde Billie Dawn in Born Yesterday.  Frankly, putting both Swanson and Davis in the same category, I have to say that Bette Davis did actually give the better performance that year, but Swanson's Norma is still a character and a force to be reckoned with!Sunset Boulevard lost out to All About Eve, the Hollywood masterpiece about the Broadway stage, at the Oscars that year.  Hollywood wasn't ready to award itself because some people didn't care for the way that the film was portraying itself (showing the dark, seamy side).  I, however, still love this film and will always love this film because I think it shows Wilder at his most perfect, most distinctive period in his life.This is a true classic.  Get this one on DVD as soon as you can!My rating: 4 stars.",

The film is what we, the audience, see. In order to really make it look like afilm, we hear the off-voice of the corpse (narrator), even when the corpse is being shown to us. A dead man describing himself as dead (the original intention was to place the speaking corpse in a morgue). Inside this clearly constructed film we find some others. To know:. -the projection of Queen Kelly, the film directed by Stroheim (who plays the projector in our film) and starred by Swanson, our actress playing an retired actress.Demille's picture, real event, it was happening at the time. DeMille plays himself. i'll get here ahead. Salome. The picture about a mad woman, the leitmotif of our film is the development of this film. The very awareness of the history of Salome will lead us to the events of our Sunset Boulevard.This is what we see. Films within films. What do they mean?: Practically every character in the film plays in the picture his status in real life:. Holden, playing the broke writer was himself having a down moment in his career. Olson, playing the ambitious potential writer was herself a struggling actress at this moment. The \"wax figures\" appear as themselves as retired \"used to be\" stars. The best comes with Stroheim and Swanson. Queen Kelly represented, at the time of its making, a huge polemic film that was no good for Swanson's career, and eventually ruined Stroheim's Its projection, by Stroheim, and the pantomime in our sunset boulevard, by Swanson, adds to its decadence feeling. DeMille also worked with Swanson, in Sunset Boulevard he is not talking to any character, he is talking to her. Obviously she was not in real life the character she portrays, but deMille talks to the real people, not the character.This is a highly intelligent and complex construction, that strikes us as a simple one. Chabrol starts his \"how to make a picture\" book by saying that if you're about to make a film, you've got to have a reason. In here it's crystal clear, the reasons. The critics to Hollywood decadent society, through drawing the turning line between two worlds. Wilder uses the relations with real true (outside films) and delivers us something that may be faced as an ambiguous world, inside and outside our real world. Films, and our lives are made of those things.The criticism it depicts are useless, dated, and a mere curiosity today, but this stands as a very clever construction and, therefor, a worth seeing picture.My evaluation: 4/5",

Just the lights and the camera and you wonderful people sitting out there in the dark.Alright, Mr. De Mille, I'm ready for my close-up\"..............Director Billy Wilder achieved Hollywood recognition with \"Sunset Boulevard\" and despite later successes with films like \"Sabrina\" (1954) and \"Some Like It Hot\" (1959), it is this film that will forever be his masterpiece. \"Sunset\" has remained an American movie classic more than 50 years later and has stood the test of time. At the time of its release, it was somewhat of a controversial and modern film, ahead of its time. Billy Wilder got away with essentially criticizing and satirizing the Hollywood film industry with the cynical and darkly comical \"film noir\" story of the tragic silent film diva Norma Desmond, magnificently portrayed by Gloria Swanson, herself a former silent film star. Not the least bit worried that she was basically parodying herself, Swanson and other silent film era stars- Swanson's former director Erich Von Stroheim, Buster Keaton, Ray Evans, Anna Q. Nilsson, even Cecil B. De Mille himself- take part in this unforgettable classic. Set in 1950's Hollywood/LA, struggling, down-on-his luck screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) avoids the car impound guys by hiding in a secluded mansion, the owner who is none other than Norma Desmond, once a big silent film star. Now she lives in a creepy, deteriorating mansion with the sinister-looking butler Max (Erich Von Stroheim). When Norma offers Joe the chance to make money writing her film script for \"Salome\" which she hopes will be her come-back movie, he accepts without knowing what he is getting himself into. Before long, Norma falls for him and becomes possessive of him, keeping him in her mad world where time has not passed her by. But Joe manages to sneak off in order to work on a script, with the equally intelligent screenwriter Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) who was formerly engaged to studio hand Artie Green (Jack Webb) but who eventually falls for Joe. When Norma discovers the relationship, jealousy gets the best of her, with tragic results for Joe. Both William Holden and Gloria Swanson have terrific chemistry and their performances earned them an Oscar nomination. This is actually Bill Holden's first important film and he would make one great film after another following this. So much to admire. The witty script full of great lines- \"I'm still big, it's the pictures that got smaller\", \"I'm ready for my close-up Mr. De Mille\", the cameo by Hollywood gossip writer Hedda Hopper and De Mille's own presence, the superb music by Franz Waxman and the subtle symbolism to be found everywhere, with one theme alone- death. Norma's career is dead and she wishes to revive it, Joe is in a state of death as a screenwriter and hopes to somehow to rekindle his writing prowess, Norma's dead monkey early in the film is a stand-in for Joe himself, who figuratively becomes her monkey and one who dies at the end of the film. The film is absolutely wonderful and this is the type of film that can never get old, despite the melodramatic quality, which, fortunately, is countered by solid dialog and a powerful attack on Hollywood society. Was the fate of silent film stars or older stars to fade away into obscurity and madness when a new wave of films and actors comes along ? The story of Norma Desmond may in fact be the real life story of silent film star Mary Pickford is truthfully a bit tragic. She tried to transition into talkies but was unsuccessful (like Norma Desmond) and in her old age she isolated herself in her big mansion and faded away. There are very little films like this nowadays. Of interesting note, this film inspired the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical and this musical will be made into a movie starring Glenn Close set to be released in 2008.",

A kind of melding of Raymond Chandler and the Brothers Grimm.' Whether SUNSET BLVD. is \"noir\" or not has divided aficionados for years for some strange reason. It is, of course -it's one of the darkest- but much more so when one considers that Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO (1960) is a slyly distorted doppelganger of the Wilder. Consider this: Both Norma & Norman are delusional recluses hiding from the outside world in crumbling old mansions. The two tarnished heroes, Joe Gillis & Marion Crane, are both outside convention (a gigolo & a thief), both are on the run (the law & the repo men), both have unforeseen events happen on the road (a rainstorm & a blow-out) which lead them to the spider- webs of demented couples (Norma & Max, Norman & Mother) and neither of them make it out alive. Their watery death connection is also unmistakable: Joe in a pool, Marion in a shower tub. The two final close-up mad scenes mirror each other as well -the skull superimposed over Norman's face is very similar to the demented rictus grin of Norma's fade-out. There's more, of course. In addition to the dark vs. light between the spider webs and the outside world, I noticed: 1) Joe Gillis is put up in a guest-room over the garage just outside the mansion. Marion Crane is put up in Cabin #1 in the no-tell motel just outside the mansion. 2) It was money that had Joe & Marion on the run and running into the spider's webs. It was their sexuality (Norma & Norman were attracted to them) that got them killed. 3) Norman & Max are volunteers for their own private traps and act as caretakers to their obsessions. 4) Dead, stuffed birds hover on the periphery during Marion's introduction to Norman and a dead, stuffed monkey introduces Joe to Norma. 5) The first we see of the living Joe Gillis is the voyeuristic camera going through the window of the Alto Nido apartments. The first we see of Marion Crane is the voyeuristic camera going through the window of a downtown Phoenix hotel. 6) Just moments before their violent end, both Joe Gillis & Marion Crane took a good look at themselves and made the final decision to \"come clean\" (in Marion's case, literally, in the shower): Joe was leaving Hollywood/Norma and going back to the mid-West and Marion was returning to Phoenix to make amends. ***This aspect makes these two film the blackest of noir! 7) Betty Schafer & Lila Crane went into the spider's web to investigate and got the shock of their lives. Lila's sister was dead and Joe Gillis was gone from Betty's life forever. Alfred Hitchcock always insisted that PSYCHO was his \"little black joke\" and now I have to wonder if the \"joke\" wasn't a clever SUNSET BLVD. redux. Hmmm...",

Pulling in off the street into the driveway of one of the fancy old houses on Sunset Boulevard, Joe finds himself called into the home of faded film star Norma Desmond. Joe only enters to get help with his car but ends up staying the night in a spare room only to find all his stuff brought inside the next morning. When the benefit of Norma's wealth sinks in, Joe decides to hang around while still pursuing other options. However Norman's constant delusions of her own fame and importance put strain on their strange relationship.I was not sure what to expect from Sunset Blvd because, as much as I would like to pretend that I have a well-rounded cinematic knowledge, I had not only never seen this film but also didn't know what it was about. I had it in my head that it was some sort of film noir and this was only reinforced with the famous opening with our main character floating dead face down in a pool. With this in my head I was a little disappointed where this \"classic film noir\" in my head did not materialise. However while I was watching it waiting for my perceptions to be satisfied, I started to take notice of what the film actually was. To my surprise I found a film that cuttingly destroys the myth of Hollywood fame within a dramatic plot. We have both extremes here: Joe frantically trying to get fame and Norma driven mad by her insulated grip on her delusional sense of fame. The ugly nature of both is exposed and used to good effect in a story that isn't as dramatic or tense as I hoped, but still easily held my attention.Wilder's direction is solid as he throws in constant digs at the fa\u00e7ade of the famous lifestyles in the movie industry of the day and even by today's standards it is pretty sharp in its tone. Interesting to wonder how it must have been received within the industry itself back in the day because it is not flattering to say the least. The central relationship is the focal point of the film and Wilder never allows us to see even a hint of reality about it \u0096 both are in it for a neediness and longing for something out of reach that can be smelt in the air anytime sufficient quantities of wannabes are gathered together in one place. The cast get this well, although their ability to totally translate it isn't totally successful in my opinion. Holden is perhaps a bit too restrained and I would have liked to see more self-disgust rise uncontrollably to the surface across his performance. That said he does provide a reasonably balanced focus to the film and his performance is solid. Swanson hams it up like an old pro and, although at times I had my doubts, it mostly works really well because she is convincingly deluded and isolated by her wealth and by the inflated idea of who she is based on a perception of herself not shared by anyone. It is an interesting character piece and, from my understanding, very relevant in a business where the next big star is always round the corner with fickle audiences and studios. The only reservation I have is how much her performance towers over the film but this is only a minor problem and it is telling how many lines and scenes I already know second-hand before I even watched it. Von Stroheim is good value in a supporting role, while Olson is also pretty good. Surprising but very relevant to see Keaton, DeMille, Warner and others in cameos as themselves.Overall this was not what I expected but, once I settled into watching it for what it was rather than what I thought it was going to be, I found a surprisingly sharp and fresh film. Wilder directs scenes with style and flair but it is the cutting judgement on fame and the nature of Hollywood that sticks in the memory. It does tend towards the melodramatic and perhaps it is one of those films (like The Player) that will mean the most to those who can relate to the world it is set in, but it is still an engaging and enjoyable film to those of us lucky enough to watch from the outside.",

Baxter in The Apartment; it is life's blood to Kirk Douglas' Chuck Tatum in Ace in the Hole; it is ironic in Stalag 17, in which William Holden's Sefton, the most opportunistic of the prisoners, ends up as the most heroic. Before all these comes Holden's Joe Gillis, whose nemesis is one of the most terrifying and glorious of all screen goddesses - Norma Desmond, incarnated by Gloria Swanson in one of the greatest ever movie performances.Swanson obviously was, to some extent, the character she portrayed: she had been one of the biggest of Hollywood names, had faded from public view, and was, in this very film, returning, as her alter-ego was attempting to do. But there the resemblance ends. With every step that Norma takes to the madhouse, Swanson moves further towards greatness. They can make the story over all they want - add songs, reshoot it frame-by-frame (someone'll undoubtedly try one day). It won't matter. Swanson will never be outrun. She knew the prototypical Norma Desmonds first hand. If things had worked out differently she might have even turned into something like one. But in the end she poured her knowledge and experience of a unique moment in artistic history into a character that could only have been created then (when sound in movies had been around for only a generation) but, through the imagination of Wilder and Brackett, became something bigger, more powerful, absorbing the weak in her wake. And that brings us back to Holden's superb turn as the spineless Gillis who, through the intercession of the splendid Nancy Olsen, finally sees the light, and dies for his insight.Writing about it, it becomes clear that this is a piece of work that transcends its time and place to join the real classics of drama. Totally brilliant.",

Gloria Swanson's bravura moment, the bravest role of her career, is positively mesmerizing. The script crackles with brilliance in every line (so many unforgettable statements and remarks about the star system) that it packs a whallop as no other film can or ever has. William Holden is perfectly cast as the definitive writer-turned-gigolo (the role was originally meant for Montgomery Clift) and Erich Von Stroheim gives yet another star turn as her manservant, Max. There simply are not enough superlatives in the English language to convey the power and dark poetry of this quintessential cinematic classic. Franz Waxman provides one of his greatest scores here. The injustice of the time was that ALL ABOUT EVE stole nearly every Oscar this film deserved to have, but clearly illustrates what sour grapes  Hollywood's elite felt after this movie hit the screens!",

            "content": "This is the third Billy Wilder film I have watched after Ace in the Hole and The Apartment. After watching these 3 films, it is quite clear to me that unlike most films of that era, Billy Wilder's films used to have substantial and thought provoking messages underneath the basic plot and Wilder loved to visually voice his opinions about the different strata of contemporary society. Ace in the Hole was an uncompromising and dark study of the media and its effects on society ,while the The Apartment was a comedy with subtle commentaries on corporate/office culture. Sunset Blvd. is a film which shows the dark side of the film industry. How cutthroat this profession can be and how quickly actors and directors can become obsolete if they fail to adjust to the dynamic nature of the business. The film revolves largely around Joe Gillis,a struggling screenplay writer and Norma Desmond, an arrogant and scarily delusional former Hollywood star of the silent era. Norma finds it difficult to accept the fact that her days of stardom are behind her and the film industry and film directors no longer care for the actors from the silent era. In order to hide from the current film industry which she considers demeaning and abominable, she has completely isolated herself from the world and deliberately caged herself in her lavish and extravagant mansion where she still is a celebrity. When she meets Gillis the screenplay writer, she thinks that he can help her finish a script which she has written on her own for a film which will be her grand comeback. Gillis looks at this as an opportunity to get money out of Norma and get some respite from his financial problems. But slowly he finds himself trapped in this mansion with no freedom (which is a metaphor for the film world and how it allures and then traps people with dreams of making it big). This fatal partnership in the end leads to devastating and diabolical conclusions for everyone involved. While watching the film, I became certain that the character of Norma Desmond must have inspired and influenced Satyajit Ray to create the character of Huzur Biswambhar Roy for his film Jalsaghar(The Music Room). Like Norma, Biswambhar who was once a respected zamindar was also arrogant and separated himself from the world, a world where aristocracy was slowly fading and giving way to modernism. But while Jalsaghar was a poetic and musical masterpiece which oozes empathy and the essence of humanism, Sunset Boulevard had a dark,neo-noirish feel about it. Billy Wilder uses a lot of metaphors and symbolism. The dream about the monkey dancing for pennies, the drawing of the curtains, the rats in the pool, the limelight falling on Norma for a few moments before being taken away,etc. all these metaphors will be very meaningful to the discerning viewers. The acting is marvelous. Gloria Swanson is fantastic with her over the top and extremely dramatic representation of Norma Desmond and William Holden's realistic acting provides a good contrast to the larger than life Norma Desmond. But the only thing that didn't work for me was the melodrama in some scenes. There were a few moments which felt too unrealistic and melodramatic,especially the scenes involving Betty Schaefer. But overall this is a chilling commentary on the film industry, the miserable plight of old, forgotten actors and the glitz and glamour of the movie world which can lead to delusions. The film ends with catastrophic consequences. But the final scene has to go down as one of the greatest scenes in all of film history. That final scene is poetic, profound and yet filled with immense horror.",

Norma Desmond aging has been actress long lost from the modern stage sits going ever so quietly insane in a huge mansion that serves as here self imposed creaking prison complex.  Surrounded by lavish furnishings in a one time architecturally masterful home that while still unique and beautiful are now aged crumbling threadbare relics of a bygone era much as is their mistress. Poor dear Norma has but one fan left an equally pathetic hanger on.  A man in name only who clings to aging film star Norma Desmond hoping his acting career gets a much needed jump start.  They both use each other much the way a Remora clings near the mouth of a shark in hopes of enjoying bits of food that steam past as the shark feeds.  Norma whose star has long ago cooled into a pile of solid iron covering an even colder neutronium core has no life giving food to share with her mercenary paramour.  So both Norma Desmond and, her toy boy do what all parasites in co-dependant relationships do eventually.... They feed off each other and, last one left standing in this case gets an imaginary close up taken by non-existent camera's as crowds of adoring fans cheer if only between Norma's ears.  Her savvy bo has taken a dip in the pool which he entered as he did the relationship with Norma eyes wide open blinded by his lust to what she was.This was an awesome story quite ahead of its time.  Brutally funny but real and eerie.  This one makes you think even when you do not want to. There is a little Norma Desmond in us all.  The want of things out of reach that lust to have just a little more time in the sun before our inevitable twilight engulfs us.  Life for Norma Desmond is a shroud that only she does not see she is wearing it.This is a must own DVD or video get the DVD when it becomes available.",

First of all,there 's the Swanson/Von Stroheim couple.He directed her in the famous \"Queen Kelly\"(another must of the silent movies).Von Stroheim was too ahead of his time,his movies scared the censors ,so he was not allowed to pursue a career that would have been stunning in the talkies.Here he became (supreme downfall),Swanson's butler ,while we see one of his former colleagues,Cecil B. De Mille,playing his own role,still directing.Von Stroheim's character is called \"Max von Mayerling\" ,probably one of Wilder's private jokes: Stroheim once said he was the son of a lady in waiting of Austrian Empress Elisabeth (Sissi) whose son Rudolph committed suicide in Mayerling!And Wilder was Austrian too. Swanson is impressive too.The comeback myth is the dream of every actor whose star is slowly but inexorably fading.that she continues viewing her old -and real!- triumphs like \"Queen Kelly,that she's writing an extravaganza shows that her comeback desire has reached the point of no return and that her only place in this world is the asylum.What Swanson did not achieve in the movie,she did it for real:she really could come back(as Lilian Gish),her performance,particularly in the last scene ,has stood the test of time. Wilder as a scriptwriter outdoes himself here;lines like \"I'm still big;it's the pictures that got small\" could be pronounced today ! 25 years later,he would try to update \"sunset blvd\" with \"Fedora\":the latter suffered by comparison,but it's a very worthwhile work that every fan of this great director should see.",

            "content": "Despite Louis B. Mayer's comments to Billy Wilder that \"You have disgraced the industry that made and fed you!\" - I feel Sunset Boulevard enhanced the Hollywood mythos. Who knows what Norma Desmonds may have existed; crazed celebrity lunatics living in their run-down ghostly mansions in the Hollywood area, not just back then but in the decades which have followed. However, the film also makes you feel sentimental for the silent era, that something really was lost when Hollywood made the transition to sound.Gloria Swanson's role as Norma Desmond is my favourite female performance of all time. Overblown, over the top, flamboyant, fantastic! A performance which could have been unintentionally comical (ala John Barrymore's Oscar Jaffe) but her insanity can be taken completely seriously; same goes for her butler Maxilillian played by Erich von Stroheim. In many ways she is that character, as Gloria Swanson has even said so herself; just looks at her reactions to watching her own pictures. Desmond is a character whose relevance for the modern world has not been lost, in an age when people are obsessed with celebrity, youth, and beauty more than ever. Likewise, Cecil B. deMille's performance feels entirely genuine, as if two old friends have just met for the first time in years.I also find the dynamic shared between William Holden and Gloria Swanson to be of fascination; an older woman seducing a much younger man who eventually gives into her when in classic Hollywood films it was often the other way around. It's clear from their actions as the film progresses the two characters are likely sleeping with each other, such as Joe happily flaunting his shirtless body in front of Norma by the poolside and she even starts drying him with a towel; there is a bit of Mrs. Robinson to her.Sunset Boulevard is possibly the most quotable film of its genre, although none its lines have become as famous in the pop culture lexicon as a film like say Casablanca, in which everyone knows its famous quotes whether or not they've seen the film or are even interested in classic cinema. Yet among circles of classic Hollywood fans, Sunset Boulevard is one of the most widely quoted films in discussions. Joe Gillis (William Holden) narrates the film despite his character being dead but it still works in an otherworldly way, like he's narrating from the afterlife. Holden holds an ideal narration voice to showcase Billy Wilder's ability to turn exposition into poetry. Likewise, Buster Keaton's appearance may be my favourite celebrity film cameo ever; there's something about his reaction when playing poker (\"pass!\").For as cynical a film as Sunset Boulevard is, ultimately it is a movie for movie lovers. Particularly the scene in which Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) tells Joe Gillis of how there is no shame working behind the camera while walking through the empty back stages of Paramount Studios at night as she tells him about her childhood spending time on studio back lots, is very life-affirming. It's such a beautiful and romantic scene; it's easy why these two were paired in several films together. Olson's character is the opposite of Norma Desmond, humble and down to Earth, not concerned with her looks or fame and fortune; and unlike Norma she can actually write movie scripts.Say goodbye to Hollywood, say goodbye my baby.",

            "content": "Sunset Boulevard represents everything that is unsaid about Hollywood. It cruelly, yet accurately represents Hollywood in the same way that Citizen Kane so cruelly and accurately represents the world of business. Sunset waste no time. It throws us straight into the middle of what appears to be a mystery, but soon becomes a tragedy, and perhaps even an allegory of Old Hollywood meeting New Hollywood and not liking it one bit, a story of unwelcome but necessary progression. We meet Joe Gillis (William Holden) within seconds of the opening credits. The twist? He's a dead. Shot and floating in a swimming pool - a pool that he has always wanted (perhaps even more than to be a writer). Joe then starts to narrate, telling us how he came to be in the pool. He was a down and out writer, living in a small flat with debts to pay. One day the debts catch up and he finds himself making a run for it. He winds up taking a wrong turn into the grounds of an old house. That house is owned by Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a middle aged actress who is past her prime but refuses to accept it and move on with her life. This is where Joe's nightmare begins, as he is effectively held captive, desperate for money, by a woman who is desperate for admiration and love and who will give anything for it, and in the end do anything to prevent the illusion from collapsing on front of her. This is where we see for the first time, that Norma could represent Old Hollywood (the past), whilst Joe could represent New Hollywood (the future). Norma and Old Hollywood are stuck in their ways. They hate the idea of progression, hate new talent, hate anything that changes the status quo and could go on to destroy them. So they becomes desperate, they take more and more desperate measures, they lure Joe and us with false promises of greatness, they bribes us. They will even take cruel punishment if it means that we and Joe will still sit there and pay attention. Norma begs Joe to hit her, rather than to hate her, and will bribe him with everything - just like Hollywood will take the remarks of critics if it means that audiences will keep going back, or it will gives us the likes of Transformers 3, a Spiderman reboot or anything that can give the illusion that it still has the answers, the talent.Because nothing scares Norma more than a lack of audience, and the same can be said for Hollywood. Of course, Joe and New Hollywood, they want progression. They, like us, hate the lack of progression, hate the repetitiveness, hate the way they and we are left in the cold when we know that we can do better. Norma thinks she still has it - but Joe knows the truth. She has had her day and needs to bow out gracefully to allow progression. At the moment, Hollywood still thinks it has it. But we know the truth - cinema numbers have fallen, and Hollywood is relying too heavily on reboots, comebacks, sequels and prequels. There is nothing original. There is little to no progression. In Sunset, the desperation in Norma turns to a jealous, uncontrollable rage that results in her essentially going mad and, SPOILER, shooting Joe dead to keep him hers and maintain her illusion that she is great. Hollywood, in desperation, doesn't shoot us dead, but does bombard us with explosions, special effects, promising adverts and violence that mask the fact that most films are no longer great, but just routine and are in desperate need of new, refreshed talent. Of course, even after all the trouble Norma causes, Joe tries hard to like her, to understand her, to make excuses, to protect her from the truth. He knows that she was a star, and at first even thinks there is a chance she could be again. And again, that can be said of us with Hollywood. We love Hollywood, not because of what it is, but because of what it once was and could be again in the right hands. We don't want to let a bright start fade. We want it to be great, so we put up with Michael Bay's Transformers, with a Spiderman reboot, with a poor remake of classics, because we hope that Hollywood will get its act together and make something bigger and better. Perhaps that final shot, where Norma reaches towards the camera, is Hollywood reaching for us in desperation?I'm not sure whether Wilder wanted to make this a film about failed stardom, or a metaphor for Hollywood. But it is a true testament to he and the cast that we can take the film literally or metaphorically, and still still be touched by it. Easily one of the best films of all time, right there with The Godfather or Chinatown. 10/10",

            "content": "Sunset Boulevard is one of the world's most beloved films. Often in just about every critic's personal top twenty films, this Billy Wilder masterpiece sets the benchmark for a movie that depicts things many aren't privileged to witness behind the sunny facade of Hollywood. Nominated for eleven Oscars but only bagging three for art direction, music and screenplay, Sunset Boulevard deserved better in what was a competitive year for movies, with Joseph L. Mankiewicz's All About Eve winning six out of fourteen nominations.Sunset Boulevard is easily Billy Wilder's most impressive entry in his illustrious resume. It was also the motion picture that was responsible for the furore surrounding its release. The film was seen as a scathing attack towards Hollywood and its playmakers, because its depiction of America's entertainment jewel was nothing like what many were deceived into thinking in the 1950s - bright, glorious, and immortal.Accurate and methodical, Sunset Boulevard dissects what's wrong with Hollywood through a fictional but highly original flashback story of a screenwriter whom never made it into the big time. The performance of the film indisputably goes to Gloria Swanson whose character Norma Desmond is perhaps one of the most laudable and complex screen villains ever written. Swanson's distinct facial features (especially her eyes) give a sense of mysticism and disquiet appeal, while her haunting voice is almost hallucinatory, possessing anyone who interacts with her.Unlucky Joe Gillis played by William Holden may be overshadowed by Swanson but his honest display as her love interest is underrated. The other star performer is Eric von Stroheim who plays a butler with a dark and difficult past. His often expressionless scenes dictate a solemn and sympathetic aura well-suited to his character. The black-and-white film stock is a perfect representation of 1950s film noir. The distinct cinematography work complements Billy Wilder's direction, which is further enhanced by richly textured set decors.The last scene is one of the most emotionally perplexed ever - highly analytical viewers will rave about how the scene initiates a whole array of feelings in them, and is a perfect conclusion to a great film. Just like Michael Curtiz's Casablanca, Sunset Boulevard gets better with each subsequent viewing. Billy Wilder has gotten away with murder, fabricating a bold, daring picture that shoots arrows at the Dream Factory. An everlasting classic!

            "content": "Something that makes Sunset Boulevard a very unique movie even to this day is how it manages to intertwine real life film history into its storyline. Not many movies utilize this, but it's fantastic when used correctly. It allows the audience to relate to the film more, because some locations and characters in it are actually real. Maybe that's what makes this movie so good, but there are of course many reasons why. The movie begins with a commonly used trope that I personally have mixed feelings about, meaning they start by showing a scene that will appear much later in the movie. As of right now, you don't understand why people are trying to retrieve someone's dead body from a swimming pool, but you'll find out in 2 hours. The body belongs to a man named Joe Gillis (William Holden), a screenwriter, who, 6 months before, drove away from men looking to steal his car. He parks it in the driveway of a large mansion which appears to be abandoned. After going inside, he finds out it is not deserted. A butler named Max (Erich Von Stroheim) mistakes him for a mortician that his employer has been expecting and urges him to go upstairs. Upon doing so, Joe comes face to face with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an aging former silent movie star who is looking to bury her dead chimpanzee. At first glance, Norma seems rude and unapproachable. She remains convinced of her superiority to other people, despite the silent era being long gone. Norma gets Joe to read a script she has created, and despite finding it terrible, Joe uses this opportunity as a pretense to move in with her. After living with her for a while, Joe is told by Max that Norma is insecure of her fading popularity and has previously tried to kill herself. Later, Joe goes to see his friend Artie and his girlfriend Betty, who reviewed a (bad) script Joe wrote earlier in the movie. After calling Max to let him know he is about to move out, Max bluntly tells Joe Norma attempted suicide again by slicing her wrists. Joe rushes to her mansion in a panic, but Norma only defiantly tells him it was a stupid thing to fall in love with him. Once Norma's injuries heal, she is driven to Paramount Studios to give her former director and friend, Cecil B DeMille, her finalized script. She receives a predictably warm welcome from everyone considering she is a film legend. What she doesn't know is that DeMille actually doesn't like the script and he only wanted her on set to use her rare Isotta Fraschini car as a prop. Meanwhile, Norma, taking DeMille's lies about her making a big onscreen comeback to heart, starts to doll herself up. Joe eventually learns from Max that he was the one who made her who she is, and was also her first husband. Norma, still harboring bad feelings for Joe, takes it upon herself to call Betty, whom Joe has been visiting lately at her office. However, the call gets interrupted by Joe when he walks in on Norma and overhears the whole conversation. Finally, Joe comes to the conclusion that he has had enough of Norma. He prepares to leave, but before doing so, cruelly tells Norma how she is washed up with no chance of revitalizing her career. Not only that, but it turns out Max writes all the fanmail she has sent to her. Joe ignores Norma's pleas and walks out the mansion and toward the swimming pool, at which point Norma fires the pistol she bought to commit suicide with at him. At long last, the flashback is complete, and the movie jumps back to the present, with Joe's corpse laying pitifully in the water. Norma's mansion is full of cops and newspapermen, and she's completely lost her mind. Still holding on to her belief she is still beautiful, famous and rich, she walks slowly down the stairs and tells the police cameras she is ready for her close-up. To her, everything is a movie, no matter how tragic. There's no doubt in my mind that Sunset Boulevard is one of the best movies of all time, but I'm stating the obvious here. It won 3 oscars, including the one for best screenplay. Gloria Swanson was nominated for best actress, but miraculously didn't win. Even though she was nothing like Norma Desmond in real life, it is true that she was a silent film star herself. As a matter of fact, the silent film Norma plays for Joe in the movie is one that Gloria appears in. It shouldn't be surprising that the acting in this movie is all great. William Holden plays the gullible scriptwriter perfectly, although I'll always remember him for Stalag 17. He comes to his senses at the end and decides to leave Norma, but she finalizes his decision for him. Gloria Swanson as Norma is the primary antagonist I would say, and you can sense something bad will happen to Joe as soon as he met her. She's obsessed with power and even tells people Paramount would not exist without her great efforts. As shown towards the end, she would rather be a murderer than be forgotten. Von Stroheim is a minor character, but still has an important role as Norma's loyal servant Max. You can argue he is too loyal to her because he writes all of her fanmail just to shut her up. For me, Sunset Boulevard is one of few movies where the backstory is actually just as interesting as the film itself. It's worth noting Billy Wilder tried very hard to pick the right woman for Norma's role, which was definitely no easy task. Possible candidates included Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, Pola Negri, Mary Pickford, Clara Bow, and even Mae West, who was enraged at the thought of herself playing a washed up old fool. As you know, the part went to Gloria, and it's hard to imagine anyone but her playing it. The bottom line is Sunset Boulevard still remains an incredible movie 70 years later, and Wilder once again shows how it's done when it comes to noirs.",

We had faces then.\" \"I'm ready for my close-up now, Mr. DeMille.\" I can't think of any other picture about Hollywood - or the world of film in general - that has achieved this unique self-reflective look at the film community. Ironically, none probably could have dreamed of the magnificent performance Gloria Swanson turned in. At barely 5 feet tall, she commands the screen like no-one else and really towers above them all as Norma Desmond, the aging, completely delusional film star from the silent era. Hard to imagine Gloria Swanson wasn't first choice to play the part of Norma Desmond with Pola Negri (too much Polish accent), Mae Murray, Mary Pickford (too sweet) and even Mae West all considered for the part of Norma Desmond.The movie opens with the bullet-riddled body of a young man floating face down in the pool next to a mansion. Soon, the story is told with the brilliant device of a voice-over of a dead man, Joe Gilis (William Holden), recounting the events leading up to his death. A broke screenwriter, down on his luck and desperate to take on any job, he stumbles upon what looks like a deserted mansion, when he's hounded by some creditors. Soon, he's ordered into the house by a female voice that turns out to belong to legendary silent screen star Norma Desmond who retreated from the outside world, now living a lonely and isolated existence with her aging servant (Erich von Stroheim). After some lamenting the current state of the film industry, she offers Joe a job of doctoring her script for SALOME, which she plans as her comeback vehicle. Clearly this is never gonna happen, but Joe decides to take the job, and he money, but soon becomes a virtual prisoner of the actress's creepy past and increasingly delusional dreamworld.Almost every sentence, remark, Swanson's antiques and postures have become part of our cinematic heritage now, we sometimes forget how delightfully crisp and clever the dialog was at the time, and still is. After the death of Norma Desmond's chimpanzee, Holden acidly remarks; \"This must have been one important chimp. The grandson of King-Kong perhaps.\" \"And then the rains came, over-sized, like everything else in California.\"This film closed the door to the old Hollwyood-generation, opened one to the new and basically started a new era in self-conscious film-making and - in the process - reconciled the until then completely forgotten silent film stars. Of the three directors featured in the film, Cecil B. DeMille was still well respected and would make some of his greatest films in the years to come. Erich von Stroheim, now degraded to being Desmond's butler, was largely an outcast by then, just as the totally forgotten Buster Keaton who's allowed to play card games at Desmond's mansion once in a while. It's quite outstanding how the cynical Wilder achieves to really make us care about the characters, all of them, but especially Norma Desmond's, whose oblivious outlook on the world surrounding her and her own long since gone fame (Von Stroheim writes her fake fan letters) really makes you pity her fate.With the right ingredients, the right script, the right casting, Wilder was able to achieve phenomenal results. Needless to say, he made a whole string of films now considered classics, but this is the pinnacle of his career and head and shoulders above any other self-reflective turn Hollywood embarked on in all the years to follow. If forced to make a shortlist of ten films I couldn't do without, this one's on it.Camera Obscura --- 10/10",

She's become this kind of otherworldly figure that doesn't fit in with normal people at all. I guess you could argue that she's the villain of the film and appropriately steals the show, but I also really like the more... sympathetic characters. William Holden and Nancy Olson have great chemistry and it's refreshing to see them on the screen together while the rest of the movie keeps showing off this weird relationship that develops between Holden and Swanson. If you don't know what the film is about, at first you may find it a little slow. As the story develops you will get sucked in and you won't even mind the fact that the story is told in flashback because you will either forget all about it or really want to know how the story you're seeing ends up the way it does.

            "content": "I am 82-years-old. I have lived through the entire \"movie\" experience. I am always amused at \"reviews\" by people who weren't alive when the films were released. They can't imagine how many millions of hopeless people discovered, for a few pennies, the magical medium to help lift them from the drudgery of life. Nor are they aware that the earliest films were photographed in pure light. However, not only were the viewers entranced with pictures that \"moved\", those who were pioneering all this magic were also fascinated that their industry was growing so quickly and ingeniously. The \"silent\" period didn't last too long. Once it was discovered voices could be recorded as the actors-actresses played their roles, the technologies were developed very quickly. \"Sunset Boulevard\" is a graphic display of how big stars fell by the wayside, because they didn't have good voices. HOWEVER, there is no mention in this movie if Norma Desmond had been tested for speaking roles. By Gloria Swanson's performance, I would say Norma would have remained a great star, because the addition of a \"voice\" would have become a tremendous asset. As proof, although so many people don't realize it, it certainly didn't hurt Ms. Swanson - she was much more active in theatrical presentations than most of the \"reviewers\" for IMDb knew of. Always read the \"trivia\" feature - you can learn so much. Some \"reviewers\" said she was the natural choice for the role, when actually she had to do an audition to be considered. This is shocking in itself, because Ms. Swanson was close friends with all of these studio-people who were looking for a star.\"The Star\" had truly always been one - many \"reviewers\" commented that 50 years-old was being ancient. Ms Swanson was well-past that age when she made this film. What few younger people know is, she ALWAYS insisted on everything she ate was organically grown. The youthfulness of her skin was one of her characteristics which made her famous. The scene in the movie where \"an army of beauticians descended\" was the only scene you saw her naked skin - her make-up for the film purposely aged her. Having been a silent screen-star, she had the advantage of over-the-top expressions, which the script by Marcus Brackette called-for. Billy wilder knew exactly what he was getting in Ms. Swanson and cashed-in on it.By 1950, many amazing technologies had been developed for movie-making. Can you imagine how out-of-place color would be here? This script called for stark whites and grey shadows and blacks, as you saw. Not many of today's stars will be filmed in pure light. Also heavily lambasted was the \"mansion\" Desmond lived in - guess what: it's still lived-in and is gorgeous. With a little \"age-ing\", it was perfect for THIS dark story and others.As all recognize, Ms. Swanson was the ultimate Desmond. Her performance was steel, as was von Stroheim's as the director-husband-butler. They knew exactly what they were doing. William Holden (Joe Gillis) was practically unknown until this career-making role came his way, and how fortunate he was to be surrounded by so much talent. His bland treatment of the role made it plausible - not much room for emotion there. His opening scene in the pool grabs your attention from the beginning - other actors could have done that role, but not as effectively nor successfully as he did. Nancy Olson (Betty Schafer) was just right for the ambitious writer; how delightful to remember Jack Webb (Artie Green) was a normal man, rather than that robot-talking cop on \"Dragnet\". Who could have done DeMille but DeMille (he had also been an actor)? Doesn't anyone remember that Hedda Hopper was an actress before she became a columnist? \"Sunset Boulevard\" was without fault, taking its place with so many classics from that era. Norma Desmond wasn't much different than almost everyone - who wants to give-up that high-paying CEO-job, or lose an election? Although movies like \"Sunset Boulevard\" don't come too often in this day and age, some of the \"starlets\" are much more outrageous - to stay in the public eye - than Ms. Desmond was. Except for the hype, I'd take this movie over \"Citizen Kane\" any ole day. All those people \"out there in the dark\" should stay in it to watch this masterpiece. Surely rates a 50 -",

Twenty years passed before I saw it again, but all those years it stuck with me. There was the man floating dead in the pool, but telling me this story, the mysterious funeral for the dead monkey, the old people sitting around playing bridge, von Stroheim flitting in and out, menacing to a boy my age, and bug-eyed Norma descending the stairs.It is a movie obsessed with death, but aren't most of our great films? Joe Gillis is like the female lead in a Gothic novel. 'Don't go in that house, Joe' but he does, and he meets the wicked witch, except she is dressed like Charlie Chaplin and she has real talent, while Gillis is no more than an interloper, an uninvited guest who does not come out the other side in the end.It was the first film I remember seeing, and will always remain my favorite.And of Wilder, the Viennese cynic?

Sunset Boulevard urges us to look at the horrific, tragic realities underlying the  comic, melodramatic, surface of tinseltown, while American Beauty  asks us to discover the traces of beauty-perhaps even the footprints Of God-hidden behind the banality of everyday existence.

            "content": "This is a perfect example of a great noir film, opening on a dead narrator unraveling the tale of his stay at Norma Desmond's estate after fleeing men trying to repossess his car. He didn't know the madness he was getting himself involved in, and neither did the audience.There are so many examples of great cinematic storytelling in this film, and we can even see this at the very beginning of the film. There are transitions that follow the on-screen movement to give these transitions a sense of continuity in how the story progresses. The many dissolves at the start of the film convey this same idea. Once we get to Norma Desmond's estate there is a tracking shot following Gillis along the hedges and then backing up to get a good view of the entire estate, and it is a glorious shot.Gillis' reflection on Desmond and her lifestyle create the sense of an unreliable narrator, though we can believe some of it. He says she is introverted, and we see this without difficulty by the mise-en- scene: she surrounds herself with pictures of herself, she refuses to hear criticism for her awful scripts, and she even watches her own silent films. She simply cannot move on from the days of silent cinema in which she was still relevant, and the inclusion of sound has not treated this decaying actress well; there is even an instance when she is in a studio and gets hit by a microphone, and it is clear by her face that this device is alien to her.The first time I viewed this film I was 16 and did not like the fact that Desmond gets away with murder at the end (I didn't realize she would probably be sent to a mental institution). Though I still don't like this fact, this film is a great tragedy combined with the best of film-noir, and it is a very eerie feeling at the film's conclusion since Desmond is completely out of her mind - she has lost herself in unreality. This film intrigues me with questions I still ask myself which makes me want to keep coming back to this masterpiece filled with so much content underneath its form.",

The great Billy Wilder as the director, William Holden, Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim as the principal actors, get their point across so brilliantly in a movie about movie making that it hurts. One of the reasons why it works so well is that \"Sunset Blvd.\" is fiction placed in the real Hollywood, where references are explicitly sought, not hidden: Star director Cecil B. DeMille plays himself, \"movie zombies\" of times past like Buster Keaton, H.B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson have roles equivalent to their importance as movie stars at the time the film was shot, even former celebrated actor/director Erich von Stroheim pretty much plays himself. This lends the film authenticity and weight, sometimes a comedic or an unabashedly cynical touch, but more often revealing shockingly tragic insights in an all too common parallel universe celebrities use to live in - insights that have not lost any relevance to this day: Once caught in a dream world it's difficult to see through the haze of glory and notice that impending doom is just a step away...It was an audacious concept of Billy Wilder to target the film industry within its own medium, right there at those very sound stages where usually the blockbusters were made to rake in the big money and produce celebrities on conveyor belts. The direct assault that \"Sunset Blvd.\" represents for sure did NOT get Wilder the Oscar for Best Picture of 1951. Well, this one has survived them all nevertheless and turned into a timeless classic. It's a film that transcended the Hollywood machinery - well informed, impeccably written by Charles Brackett and Wilder himself, full of verve, innuendo and dark humor, directed with technical proficiency and sense of great storytelling.

            "content": "\"Alright, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my closeup,\" is the oft-misquoted line from Sunset Boulevard, one of the greatest Oscar-baits in history. An aging silent movie actress lives reclusively in her Sunset Boulevard mansion and dwells on her past fame instead of her ability to adjust to the modern era. A young hopeful screenwriter crosses her path and she becomes obsessed with the idea of a comeback. Wouldn't every actress over the age of forty kill for that part, knowing they'd probably reserve the Best Actress Oscar in 1951? Well, Pola Negri, Norma Shearer, Mary Pickford, Mae West, and my personal preference, Greta Garbo, all refused the part. Anyone who knows their history knows that Gloria Swanson didn't win her Oscar in 1951; she was beaten out by the ridiculous Judy Holliday in Born Yesterday.Part of Sunset Boulevard that tugs at the audience's heartstrings is the similarities between Gloria Swanson's career and the plot points written for her character, Norma Desmond. Gloria was a silent movie star who worked prolifically for Paramount Studios; Norma has a line of dialogue: \"Without me, there would be no Paramount.\" Gloria's career tapered off when sound pictures became popular, as did Norma's. Many of Gloria's silent movies were directed by Erich von Stoheim; in Sunset Boulevard, Eric plays Norma's devoted butler who believes she's the \"greatest star of all\". If you find all those connections heartwarming, you'll probably like this movie.All the other parts of Sunset Boulevard, the ones that don't tug on the audience's heartstrings, make me dislike the movie. First off, the opening scene is one of the worst opening scenes in any old movie I've ever seen! The beginning ruins the entire story, and there's no way the audience can forget what's just been spoiled. If by some miracle you've never seen this movie, do yourself a favor and fast-forward the first five minutes.I'm not a William Holden fan, so I would have preferred Montgomery Clift, who was actually signed on for the part, and whom I like very much. Fred MacMurray, another choice during casting, would have also been great, since he mastered the \"voice-over\" film noir technique years earlier. All the scenes of Bill by himself or with his love interest, the forgettable Nancy Olson, feel like a B-picture. The first few times I saw this movie, my mind had tried to help me by forgetting William Holden was even in it; I was continually disappointed to watch him in the vast majority of the film.This one's a classic, so if you're an old movie buff, you can't really get away with skipping this one. Don't feel bad if it doesn't become your favorite, though; you're not alone. I don't really like this one and feel the connection Gloria Swanson had to her character elevated it to Classic status. She may have won the \"part of a lifetime\" but in my opinion, many, many other actresses could have given an equally effective performance.",

            "content": "There is a reason why Sunset Boulevard became a sort of defining movie of the film noir genre. It involves ruthless murder, sexual connotations, deceit and failed romance. However, there is difference between this film and other noir titles, which actually made people more interested in seeing Sunset Boulevard. Mainly, Billy Wilder's depiction of a story of a forgotten movie star seemed so real and believable that everyone wanted to experience it from the side of a passer- by. For ages humans were interested in the lives of the rich and famous. And this film presents one of the saddest and toughest moments in the life of a celebrity \u2013 the sudden and unexpected fall into the nothingness after years of being on top. Additionally, Wilder gave a very strong and gloomy twist to it, making the movie a real directorial masterpiece.The movie sets a very fast pace right from the start, showing a dead man floating in the swimming pool, as the police arrives at the scene of the crime.Then starts the retrospect, presenting the viewer with a tragic tale that centers on an aged woman, Norma Desmond, who was once a huge silent movies' star in Hollywood. However, with the beginning of the sound era she simply became useless. No one wanted to cast her in the new productions. Yet, she still believes that her fans are writing to her and that she will once again rise and be on the posters all around town.Sunset Boulevard, the address of her house, is a great allegory to her position in the film world. She had her time on the pedestal, but know the Sun has inevitably set on her career and she can't do anything about it. Every day she is struggling with thoughts of a comeback (a word, which she actually hates), but it just won't happen. Only her butler (and first husband) Max is aware of this\u0085Somewhere along the road, completely out of the blue, comes her savior, the screenwriter named Joe Gillis. He is desperate for some money to cover his loans. She is desperate for someone to edit her personally written script for a movie, in which she will also play the main role. Her insanity makes her incredibly jealous over him. She doesn't let him leave and meet other women, even though he is just using her and her money without any feelings. That the story ends in great tragedy mustn't be stressed, obviously. Going deeper and deeper into the madness leads to the final outburst, the 'beautiful' crime. Paradoxically, this is the moment when the cameras start rolling again and she is the main object of interest. And she loves it, like she didn't even know what happened a few hours before.Gloria Swanson definitely steals every scene that she's in. She is marvelous as this old star, who still thinks that she is younger, prettier and more talented than all those young Hollywood actresses. Her fantastic style, seriousness, way of speaking \u2013 it all makes for an unforgettable performance. William Holden stressed with this role that he is a marvelous actor and possibly one of the greatest in the 20th century Hollywood. Also, fine use of narration to add to the dark atmosphere of the profoundly calamitous events occurring throughout the movie. All in all, this is definitely one of the movies that are a must see in the history of American cinematography. It shows how thin is a line between fame and obscurity. We don't even know how many of the once-famous characters were suddenly deemed useless and replaced by new generations. It sounds as sad, as it is inevitable.",

            "content": "One of the first films to truly shed light on the true nature of world behind cinema was Sunset Boulevard (Billy Wilder, 1950). It was already the tendency of film noir to be rather bleak in its portrayal of human nature, but this movie almost seemed to point the gun at itself. Despite a few critics, the movie is hailed for its uncompromising tale that of which concerns the two leads, William Holden as the out-of-luck screenwriter Joe Gillis and the fallen star Norma Desmond, played by Gloria Swanson. The grisly story that follows is one of desperation, deceit and of course twisted love. The film achieves this thru its ominous film noir style-cinematography and well done characterization.As the story progresses, it crushes and grinds her dreams without a second glance. The real side of the Hollywood Star System is that actors and actresses all have specific niches, and once that role has been completed and used up, their use usually comes to an end. After a certain extent of glamour, no matter how beautiful the reign, it can never really last forever. The film also displays the cold reality of the world, through the natural tendency of human beings to forsake others. Only in madness, did anyone turn their cameras back on Norma Desmond, and only in death did anyone truly miss the one-shot writer Joe Gillis. Not only that, but the love story between him and Betty Schaefer (played by Nancy Olson) ends rather sadly, before he even meets his own more pressing tragedy. As always in film noir, fate is cruel and seemingly random. It is thru the beautiful cinematography and shadowy characters that Billy Wilder uncovers the truth of a world that before had seemed purely idealistic and welcoming.",

I somehow hoped that Joe Gillis would get himself mixed up in a murder case or something, when in fact he wound up being a victim of one in the end. Good performance all around, although not really Oscar worthy(maybe the fact that I saw \"A Man For All Seasons\" just a couple of days ago speaks for itself). I truly hope it wasn't the murder plot or shall I say the final \"twist\" that impressed so many viewers, because as much as it is unusual (and for that time perhaps almost revolutionary) I saw it coming a mile away, which is the main reason with my disappointment with \"Sunset Blvd.\" Once I knew exactly what was going to happen there just wasn't any fun in watching the lonesome and forgotten old silent-movie actress tormenting herself and others anymore. I can't figure out why this movie stands so tall in the IMDb 250 greatest; a great beginning, a nice ending and some of the best narration(By William Holden) ever put onto the big screen, but the predictability of it all made \"Sunset Blvd.\" overly long and not nearly as pleasing and good as it could have been. 7/10",

Well, Sunset Boulevard (aka Sunset Blvd.) was just such a film for me.William Holden \u2013 who also narrates the film \u2013 plays Joe Gillis, a small-time screen writer, down on both money and luck; as we find out right at the beginning of the film, Gillis won't be alive by the end of it. He meets former silent movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who cannot and will not accept the truth that her star has long since faded into obscurity and she has been all but forgotten by both the film industry, and movie-goers. Determined to have another hit film, she hires Joe to help her edit her self-penned script, but she soon becomes obsessed with him, and Joe finds himself less a guest, more a prisoner, at her dilapidated home, with only Norma and her mysterious butler Max for company.As you may have guessed, I loved this film. The storyline is a caustic and witty dig at a fickle Hollywood. The fact that viewers are informed by Joe's voice-over right at the start of the film, that he will not survive to the end, fills the ensuing scenes with a bitter sense of doom, and the contrast between Joe the narrator, who knows his fate, and Joe the character who we see on camera, who is unaware of what will befall him, is very effective (A similar idea was used years later in American Beauty, also with excellent results, although Sunset Boulevard was, for me, a much better film.)Gloria Swanson was excellent as Norma Desmond, and at times was difficult to watch. I disliked her character, but couldn't help feeling great sympathy for her. Deserted by her fans and her colleagues, she is losing her grip on reality. At times, she was manic and unpredictable; at other times, she showed tenderness and extreme vulnerability (the scene where she entertains Joe by dressing up as Charlie Chaplin is both sweet and disturbing, as her happy mood turns to anger). Swanson was nominated for an Oscar for her performance; the same year Bette Davis was nominated for her role in All About Eve \u2013 both lost out to Judy Holliday for her role in Born Yesterday, which also starred William Holden. He was also nominated for Sunset Boulevard.William Holden shows his real talent for acting here. A not altogether likable character at the beginning of the film, he nevertheless gets the audience on side, as he and they come to realise the untenable situation in which he has found himself. He imbues his character with passion, tenderness, ruthlessness, and resignation \u2013 oh, and he's darkly funny too.Eric von Stroheim is perfectly cast as Norma's taciturn and mysterious butler \u2013 this role could easily have been a caricature in different hands, but he plays the part brilliantly.The main cast is rounded out by Nancy Olsen as Betty Schaefer, a young writer who wants Joe's help on a script; she is perfectly cast as a feisty but tender young woman who is dragged into Joe's nightmare world.In short, my opinion for what it's worth, is that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this film. It's gripping \u2013 I felt unable to turn my eyes away from the screen; it's sad, it's tragic, and it's bleakly funny. It was a real victory for director Billy Wilder, and it's the best film I've seen in a long time. Very highly recommended.",

We then move back six months and Gillis tells us about his own life. He is a hack screenwriter whose scripts are not in demand; he is behind on his rent and debt collectors want to repossess his car. One day he flees from these debt collectors and turns into the driveway of an apparently abandoned house on Sunset Boulevard. Of course it isn't abandoned; it is the home of fading star of the silent era Norma Desmond and her butler Max. It emerges that she is dreaming of a return and has written a script which he offers to polish, despite knowing it will never be anything other than terrible. Soon he has moved in and she is spending money on him... and he feels more and more trapped. As the story progresses the more tragic Norma appears.This is one of those classic films that one fears won't live up to its reputation but actually exceeds it. It manages to be both tragic and comic with its look at Hollywood's darker side. Norma Desmond is shown to have been one of the great stars of the silent era but now she is virtually forgotten by younger people and pitied by those who do remember her. She is clearly troubled when we meet her but by the end it is obvious that she is mad. Gloria Swanson is excellent in the role. Gillis is no less tragic a character; failing as a screenwriter, becoming a kept man in a claustrophobic environment and when he does appear to be finding real success and love it goes tragically wrong; William Holden captures this character perfectly. There are also fine performances from Erich Von Stroheim as Max, Nancy Olsen as romantic interest Betty and Cecil B DeMille in an extended cameo as himself. Having DeMille playing himself could easily have broken the suspension of disbelief but in fact it adds to the feeling of realism. As well as being a good story it looks great; the shots of '50s Los Angeles are evocative of the era and the crumbling mansion perfectly mirrors how Norma's grip on reality is crumbling.

It's focus on the great lost generation of silent films stars and its unforgiving look at the cut throat and fickle world of Hollywood is chilling and, at its heart, are two magnificent performances from William Holden and, especially, Gloria Swanson as the reclusive, fallen star, Norma Desmond. It is a work of utter genius reflected by its oft quoted lines (\"All right, Mr. DeMille. I'm ready for my close up.\") and memorable visuals (the body floating in the swimming pool).The story of the chance meeting of down on his luck writer, Joe Gillis, with the former silent movie star, Norma Desmond, is brilliantly written (the film was a deserving recipient of the Oscar for screenplay). Gillis is an unscrupulous and seemingly hopeless dreamer, out of money and out of time. Desmond is similarly hopeless, but tragically so. She is not the architect of her own despair, but has been abandoned by everyone and yet is determined that she is still desired and loved by the \"millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen\". She sits in a Kubla Khan as detailed and as haunting as Citizen Kane's, protected by her mysterious butler (an effective Erich von Stroheim, who later dismissed his part in the film as \"that butler role\").The treatment of Desmond is distressing, and Gillis joins the fun, leading her on and taking her money, before he suddenly realises that he is trapped. Gillis is not as inhuman as he perhaps needs to be to follow the road he has started on and he is, thus, doomed. He cannot leave Desmond, who will undoubtedly kill herself in despair and is unable to write the script that may make him or be with the women he loves. The villain is Hollywood and its cut-throat and unforgiving nature which is brutal on its people and impossible for a man with the smallest slice of conscience.This was a brave film for Wilder to make, not so much biting the hand that fed him but cooking it in butter and serving it to the dogs. However, he got away with it and no wonder why. Even the hardest man had to step back and acknowledge the brilliance of craft, the harshness of wit and power of storytelling in this film. It is brutal, dark and excellent in every way.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder who has my vote as the Greatest Director of all Time with a body of work that is stunning: Double Indemnity, Stalag 17, Sabrina, and his comedic masterpiece Some Like It Hot, made his greatest film Sunset Blvd and today when I see it over and over I discover new tidbits of Information. Brilliant. William Holden who would win an Oscar a few years later in Wilder's Stalag and would star in Wilder's great late career masterpiece Fedora is superb as Joe Gillis. The key role in this movie is played to a fare thee well by Gloria Swanson who is magnificent, and gives in my opinion the finest performance by a female star ever; Gloria Swanson became Norma Desmond. As we know Gloria Swanson lost the Oscar to Judy Holiday for her wonderful Born Yesterday, seen today Swanson should have won. From the brilliant opening to the incomparablefending, this movie works on all levels. Masterpiece.Billy Wilder pushed the envelope his films, very daring, for example Some Like It Hot touched upon many themes one of course was Jack Lemmon's character wherein in the end it appears Lemmon and Joe E Brown will end up together.Wilder cast his films brilliantly with stars such as Stanwyck, Holden, Swanson, Monroe reaching new heights under his guidance. Billy Wilder had a bit of a stock company using Holden, Lemmon, and McMurray,over and over. One film that deserves reappraisal is the Kiss Me Stupid with a fine performance by Kim Novak. Other stars that worked for Wilder included a Who's Who of Hollywood: Marlene Dietrich,James Cagney Jean Arthur, James Stewart, Audrey Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart, Walter Matthau, Paula Prentiss, Henry Fonda, Shirley MacLaine et al.Bravo Billy Wilder",

Its portrayals of a narcissistic woman's hunger for now-vanished fame, and the tough-guy writer who is engulfed by her destructive ambitions, overcomes some slight script flaws that result from over-striving for the noir tone. Sometimes the emphasis on the characters' utter doom is hard to take; more often, it is extremely effective. William Holden is perfect in the role of Joe Gillis, a down-on-his-luck scriptwriter; many actors could not convey his mixture of repulsion and fascination with the ex-movie star. Gloria Swanson is occasionally too melodramatic, but her grotesqueness distinguishes her character from the classic femme fatale of most films noir. Altogether a great film-- the camerawork alone is worth watching.",

            "content": "First off, read that name a few times. Then a few more. 'Sunset Boulevard.' Does that not just send shivers up your spine? Yes, I am well aware that it is the title of the famous street in Los Angeles in which the film takes place. But it seems more... invocative than just that. If such is pure coincidence, then it is a coincidence that makes a great film even better. But i don't think it was. Knowing the quality of this film, I think that it was meant to invoke deeper feelings in the viewer than just 'oh, that's the name of a street in Los Angeles.' When the film begins, we are greeted with a flash-forward to the end of the movie. I always love it when films or books do this. Surprise is sometimes good, but it is often overrated. Once enough time is out, everyone knows your secret. So there is certainly something to be said for just revealing what happens at the end of the film and launching into an elucidation of how such came to be.We are also greeted with an opening narration. From that moment onwards, this film had me. Not because I am just a sucker for opening narrations (though I am). But because it is just so good. And I say that as a novelist. Truly, it is one of the best openings narrations I've seen or heard, in literature or film or any other medium. With one fell swoop, it sets the tone of film, establishes intrigue and tension, and messages your brain and heart.The style of this film is excellent. Every decision is conscious and It also establishes the fact that this film takes heavily from film noirs. I don't think I would quite consider it a noir on its own night. But it certainly was made by someone who not only loves film noir, but knows how to make use of it, and what it adds to a film. As a lover of noir myself, I will always support that.purposeful, advancing the fabric of the tightly woven story. But style isn't everything. Which makes it a good thing that this film succeeds on grounds of substance as well. It should tell you something that the first work that came to mind as I watched this was The Great Gatsby. It's not a perfect comparison, of course, but it does manage to invoke some of the same complex feelings.There are so many themes at play here that I could be up here until midnight three days from now and still not have covered everything. But you don't need to fully unravel them; for mood and story's sake, it is enough to know that they are there, that they are present and will keep being so. It's like you're a kid watching a complex work for the first time; you may not know every intricacy that is on display, but you nonetheless are comforted by their presences.At its core, this film is about a young, out of work, broke scriptwriter who is just ready to give up on the Hollywood Dream and head back to Ohio when he is confronted with a grand mansion that is owned by an Old Hollywood fading star who invites him in. She sends him to work on her overblown, worthlessly-written screenplay that she thinks will make her a star once more. For this and above all else, for comfort, she persuades him to stay with her. Having no other place to go, the young writer agrees. For a while, he lives the high life. he even gets an expensive suit. But when he wants to leave, she gets clingy and... things get interesting.It gives off the feeling that he is being pulled deeper and deeper into a spider's web. But, in a bit of a twist, the spider does not want to kill him. Yes, she is delusional and insane and dangerous to herself and others. But she has no vile or inherently malicious bones in her body. She is just, at her heart, a lonely and insecure person who is caught up in yearning for past glories, who makes herself feel far older than she really is. The young man has a great quote about this that is both fitting in context and translatable out of it. It goes like this: There's nothing tragic about being 50, not unless you try to be 25. Simple. Concise. And flush with enough resonance to fill up a twenty-mile long crater.If you could take away only thing from this film, let it be that realism is not always needed to make a movie pierce on a real and scathing level. This film is heightened and almost reminiscent of a nightmare. But it is the best Hollywood does Hollywood movie ever and the most definitive.See you on Sunset Boulevard.",

            "content": "\"Sunset Boulevard\" has a special place in my heart as one of the first classics that interested me in cinema. It still works great after 70 years as it's a simple, straightforward, but focused film that manages to deal with timeless themes with sarcasm and intelligence without having no arthouse pretentiousness or making no life-changing statements. Video quality aside, there is nothing I would change about it.The characters are iconic thanks to the fact that they are played by actors that actually experienced the dawn of the silent era and the struggles to survive in the ever-changing Hollywood industry. Forgotten silent era diva Norma Desmond is played by Gloria Swanson, who was herself a faded star who lost her job due to the advent of sound films. Her butler and former director Max is played by Erich von Stroheim, who happens to have directed some of Gloria Swanson's classics (one of them gets even projected in Norma's living room). Director Cecil DeMille plays himself, and other silent era actors and old Hollywood personalities like Buster Keaton also have cameos.I also loved how, in the end, none of the characters is really positive. Norma and Max are self-delusional and unable to accept that the world around them has changed, they would do anything to prevent their dream from falling apart. Joe and Betty represent the \"young\" Hollywood, but they are blinded by their ambition and egoism to the point they both chose to embark on a clandestine affair, even though they owe everything to their partners.First-person narration by the already dead protagonist Joe Gillis makes the film even more fascinating. Gillis is a talentless but arrogant screenwriter who succumbed to Hollywood's trap of fame, and it feels almost ironic that \"Sunset Boulevard\" could have been the first successful screenplay in his career.The dialogues tend to be over the top at times, but they perfectly suit Norma's character and lifestyle. Gillis' cynical tone in the narration, combined with the awareness of his tragic fate, also manages to make us understand that we are not dealing with the usual melodramatic sentimentality of Hollywood.",

It shows the result of how a \"lovely girl at the age of seventeen\" is being turned into the most hideous monster one can imagine. And how does this come about? Simply by being a star and thereby becoming delusional about her own importance. It can probably be a very hard lesson to learn that you can be adored by the crowds and the next minute forgotten. And if you have build your identity up around being a star what do you have left if and when this happens? Absolutely nothing except your memories and the hope of returning to the screen. In the case of Norma Desmond you immediately sense how unrealistic the hope of returning to the screen is and you are horrified by her appearance which suggests to you that she is still playing one of her silent movies roles where it was important to \"overplay\" since there was no dialogue. Gloria Swanson is gruesome to watch in this role \u2013 this is acting on a level that you rarely see.Then she adds an incredible depth to her part as she shows us how vulnerable she feels towards Joe Gillis who in return is torn between contempt and some sort of affection towards her. Her servant helps her building up a world of illusion and he finally succeeds in giving her what she wants; to play a part in front of the rolling cameras; It doesn't get more \"noir\" than this.Recommend this without any hesitation.Regards Simon",

While trying to evade his creditors, he gets a flat tire and parks in a decadent mansion in Sunset Boulevard. He meets the owner and former silent-movie star Norma Desmond, who lives alone wit her butler and driver Max. Norma appears slightly deluded and believes she will return to the silver screen, and is isolated from the world by Max, who was her director and husband for a while. Norma proposes Joe to move to the mansion and help her write a screenplay for her comeback and inadvertently becomes her lover. When Joe falls in love with up and coming writer Betty Schaefer, Norma becomes jealous and and her madness leads to an underlying meltdown.....When the term 'they don't make them like this anymore' this is one of those films that easily fits into that paraphrase. The film has two narrative structures throughout, and they fall into two genres, Film Noir, and Psychological thriller.To be once the biggest star, and then to fall into obscurity must be every celebrities nightmare, so this film must be the perfect horror film for all stars who grace the titular location. For Norma, her wealth and her belongings are her prison, because no matter hoe delusional she appears to be, she knows that outside in the real world, she is long forgotten in Hollywood, and age is definitely one on her side.So Joe is like a breath if fresh air to her, and reignites her obsession for stardom, and in many respects, her obsession with Joe, which leads to the Film Noir element of the story.Swanson and Holden are spectacular, but Swanson, her on screen breakdown is a revelation, and the final third of the movie is as haunting and as harrowing as to what is going on in Norma's head when she is alone.It's a landmark movie, deserved of all its plaudits and fans, and it's a stern warning to anyone who is thinking about a career in Hollywood, the paves maybe paved with gold, but you are risking rats in your pool.Essential cinema in every way possible.",

            "content": "The film industry obviously did not know what had hit it when Billy Wilder's masterpiece was released in 1950. Fifty years later, such mastery in craftmanship still shows by still being fresh and alive, evident from the first of the unforgettable reels when William Holden's character, an unknown writer, is lying face down and dead in the pool of an extremely possessive star of the silent screen. Although not my favourite of Billy Wilder's works, (\"Witness for the Prosecution\" is my own special favourite), this was not actually the first time he had stirred Hollywood. \"The Lost Weekend\", a film more scarce in its circulation but just as brilliant, had five years before almost lost a release because the type of slap-in-the-face reality was something audiences were unused to. And it eventually went on to be the best picture of 1945. However, by casting light on an industry still even seen today as the perfection of life, the Paramount studios caused an uproar from coast to coast.One of the more interesting contenders at the Oscars \"Sunset\" had that year was \"All About Eve\". The Bette Davis/Anne Baxter film did eventually take the coveted prize best picture prize, but it is obvious that \"Eve\" too runs along pretty similar lines, but instead of shattering the myth about the golden days of the silver screen which went for the throat, the 20th Century Fox executives gave it a gentler shape by provocatively going after the theatre. Haunting music and even the black and white cinematography made me feel I was in for a special ride as the opening credits rolled. William Holden was in one of his best roles. This movie unfortunately made Gloria Swanson be better remembered by us as the tragic aging movie queen of the silent era, who was one of the many actors and actresses who phased out as the sound picture experiments became a sensation. Featured also are Erich von Stroheim as the first husband turned servant and Nancy Olsen as the young girl writing collaborator. All four received Academy Award nominations, though none won. Cecil B. De Mille, one of the great directors of the silent era puts in an appearance on the featured Paramount lot as himself.The screen play, as in all great Billy Wilder movies, is gripping and fiercely brilliant. Just some of the emotions captured on film, and some of the darker imagery has made it one of the best films of the 1950s, and one of the best movies in Hollywood history. \"Singin' In the Rain\" may have made it better known to us with the use of colour, dance and song, but it did not even go anywhere near \"Sunset\" despite the bitter sweet sensation the musical gem leaves. Deservedly so, this cinematic genius is first rate.Rating: 10/10",

            "content": "Hollywood has been making films about itself almost as long as there has been a Hollywood to make films about, but there were three very fine examples in the early fifties, \"Sunset Boulevard\" from 1950 and \"The Bad and the Beautiful\" and \"Singin' in the Rain\" from two years later. It has been suggested that both \"Singin' in the Rain\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\" were based upon the career of Norma Talmadge, a major star of the silent era in the twenties who (like Lina Lamont in \"Singin' in the Rain\") found it difficult to adapt to the coming of sound because of a strong working-class accent. Talmadge was still alive in the early fifties, and I often wonder what she must have made of these two films. Unlike \"Singin' in the Rain\", a Technicolor period piece set in the twenties, \"Sunset Boulevard\" has a contemporary setting and was shot in an expressionistic black-and-white reminiscent of film noir. (Director Billy Wilder had earlier made one of the great classic noirs, \"Double Indemnity\"). During the early fifties many of the stars of the silent era were still alive and living in the Hollywood and Beverly Hills area, and were still fondly remembered by the older generation, but were no longer the celebrities they had been at the height of their fame and were little-known to younger people. The film deals with one of these, Norma Desmond, a faded silent diva whose career, like Talmadge's, came to an abrupt end with the coming of the \"talkies\". Norma has retained considerable wealth from her days as a star but has become a lonely recluse, living in her vast mansion with no company but her German servant Max. She still receives quantities of fan mail, and harbours dreams of making a triumphant comeback; she is writing a screenplay based upon the story of Salome and John the Baptist and hopes that it will be made into a film by her old friend Cecil B. DeMille with herself as the star. The other main character in the film is Joe Gillis, an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter. When we first meet Joe he is floating face down, quite dead, in Norma's swimming pool. We then discover in an extended flashback how he met Norma by chance, was recruited to assist with her \"Salome\" screenplay, became her lover and eventually ended up in that swimming pool. A subplot deals with Joe's relationship with his friend Artie Green and Artie's girlfriend Betty Schaefer, a studio script reader with ambitions to become a script writer. The script for \"Sunset Boulevard\" was co-written by Wilder and his producer Charles Brackett, and it is a fine one. There is a streak of sardonic humour running through it, although it is not really a comedy (unless, perhaps, a very black one). The main themes are self-delusion and the traps of fame. Norma, in the teeth of all the evidence, persuades herself that she is still a star, that the \"talkies\" are just a passing fad and that the public are longing for the great Norma Desmond to make her comeback in a silent film. She also convinces herself that Joe is in love with her, while it is clear that he is just using her for her money. Although Joe sees the truth about Norma all too clearly, he has fallen prey to a delusion of a different kind, namely that he can touch pitch and not be defiled. He thinks that he can exploit Norma shamelessly, that he can carry on an underhand affair with Betty while remaining friends with Artie, and that in spite of everything he can still retain his spiritual and artistic integrity. He thinks that he can succeed in the Hollywood system without needing to make the necessary compromises with reality. Norma never wakes from her dreams, eventually spiralling downhill into madness, but Joe eventually realises that he cannot have it all, that he cannot have Norma, and Betty, and his writing career. Shortly before his death he resolves to renounce them all and to return to his old job as a journalist in Ohio. His moment of lucidity costs him his life, but it enables him to regain his self-respect. This was an ambitious theme for a movie, but Wilder found two actors equal to the task in Gloria Swanson and William Holden. Swanson herself had been a major silent star whose career had waned with the coming of sound and who saw in \"Sunset Boulevard\" her chance of making a return to the screen. (Her last feature film had been nine years earlier). Today this is probably the role for which she is best remembered. As for the much younger Holden, this was the film which made him a major star. There is another good performance from Erich von Stroheim as Max, who at first seems a sinister figure but is later shown to be a devoted servant with a secret of his own. When the film came out, it was popular with the public and acclaimed by the critics, but Louis B Mayer publicly berated Wilder for biting the hand that fed him by satirising the industry that had made him famous. These sentiments were by no means universal in the film world; several figures from the industry, notably DeMille, agreed to appear in cameos as themselves. I do wonder, however, if feelings similar to Meyer's were responsible for the film's relatively poor showing at the Oscars compared to its main rival, \"All about Eve\". That film, of course, is also about an ageing actress, but is set in the world of the theatre, not the cinema. Far safer to satirise Broadway than Hollywood. Today, however, both films have taken their rightful place among the classics of the cinema. 9/10",

I just wondered how the story was going to turn out in the end. Billy Wilder brought back to the screen in 1950, great Silent film stars with Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim who was an assistant director to D.W. Griffith, \"Birth of a Nation\".  Gloria Swanson was a famous actress and after this film, her career took off once again, with Films, Television and many business ventures.   When Billy Wilder made pictures, they all became great CLASSICS for all generations to view and enjoy.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder's paramount triumph of film-noir melodrama, piercing through the Hollywood industry's utter callousness and an over-the-hill silent era actress' poignant illusion of a comeback to garner the spotlight. The film begins like DOUBLE INDEMNITY (1944, 8/10), our ill-fated protagonist Joe Gills (Holden), a 30 something hack writer for the Hollywood studio, narrates beyond his grave to reveal the tragedy ending - as shown in a majestic shot from the angle of the bottom of a swimming pool (a trick done by putting a mirror in the bottom and shot from its reflection), a man's body is floating on the water, facing down, and for sharp eyes, it is obviously Joe himself. So while the voice-over gravely chronicles his story of the last months of his life, on screen, audience is gravitated by the parallel presence of the unwitting Joe, from his down-and-out predicament, till he accidentally runs into Norma Desmond's (Swanson) dilapidated mansion on Sunset Boulevard, on the day of her pet chimp's funeral. The metaphor of Joe's destiny is too apparent to overlook, being a substitute of the lonely but opulent has-been's companion, until his own doom. Wilder and his co-writers cook up a perfect match for the duo, Norma has penned her own script of Salome and is desirous of launching her comeback with Cecil B. DeMille in the Paramount lot. So she is in urgent need of a writer to revise her dilettantish work, and Joe, just reaches the end of his tether to survive in the showbiz, it realistically starts off as a win-win deal for both, until when Joe realizes what Norma needs is more than just a writer and what is more satirically, he is not a competent ghost writer, the output of Salome's script is a dud, Paramount has no intention to produce the picture at all, although indulging a 50-year-old to star as Salome is too idiosyncratic to begin with. So Joe caves in as a reluctant gigolo for Norma and she falls for him inevitably, her suffocating dominance is normally compensated by her gratification of material luxury. Naturally Joe is struggling, the reality is too hard to refuse, but internally he despises of his degeneration. It is a moral dilemma, so there must be a vent somewhere, when he meets Betty Schaefer (Olson), a young and inspiring fellow writer, age 22, the time with her becomes his safe haven, even his writer's block is dismantled, they contribute wonderful ideas for a new script of a romance. Unfortunately Norma will never let him go, the tricky part is, Joe is never completely heartless to her, on the first notice of her suicidal attempt at the New Year's Eve, he rushes back to her bed immediately and they reconcile romantically. We can tell Joe loves her, but with the condition of sympathy, guilt and shame, and it is all because of the 20-year-old age difference and the huge gap in their social status, the film is bold tirade aiming at the hypocritical showbiz of its ageism and male chauvinism. For Norma, Joe represents the last straw of her life, her mirage of being an eternal star which is timeless and beloved. Swanson gives a show-stopping tour-de-force as Norma, exaggerates her condescending mannerism with dramatic grandeur and empress mien, the trademark popped eyes and protruding jaw perfectly render a thrilling pathos as someone who is ridiculously ill-fitted in the present world thanks to her own background which is painfully similar to Norma. The film gifts Swanson the only opportunity to shine in the talkie era and she accomplishes it with impeccability, this is one of the most powerful performance ever (I give her an edge over the equally iconic performance from Betty Davis in ALL ABOUT EVE 1950, 9/10), and its indelible impact is caustically mind-blowing, not to mention her final descending from the stairs to the cameramen, and her iconic last line. Swanson is not the only one carry an autobiographic curve in the story, so is Erich von Stroheim, as Max, her dour but loyal butler-cum-chauffeur, the only one takes care of her in the decadent manor, more shockingly is later he reveals to be Norma's first husband and the director who has brought her to stardom and accompanies her into obsolescence. In real life Mr. von Stroheim and Ms. Swanson both suffered a career debacle after their collaboration in QUEEN KELLY (1929).SUNSET BLVD. is also a breakthrough for Holden, not entirely overshadowed by Swanson's supremacy, his Joe is a tale of woe himself, his final severance from Betty by willfully divulging his toy boy identity is handled equally with weighty melancholy and beautiful delivery; as for Olson, she bespeaks the common guidance as a young man's pursuit, all four main actors acquire Oscar nominations, but only hers is lingering on unworthiness.In a nutshell, the film deserves its iconic prestige and is deservingly one of Wilder's most accomplished films among his cannon (alongside SOME LIKE IT HOT 1959, 9/10).",

He really made some great movies on great themes without ever losing his focus on the entertainment value of the movie. 'Stalag 17', 'double indemnity', 'the apartment' all are such great movies. Most of the movie is narrated in first person and you see what the protagonist sees, a technique which has been used in so many movies after this. The narration is flawless and drama so intense that I watched the whole movie without batting an eyelid. The characters are real with shades of grey that you empathize and dislike at the same time. The whole thing is dark and a film noir in true sense. One of my all time favorites and I cannot over-recommend this movie to anyone.",

            "review_title": "Hollywood's Self-Iconoclast Masterpiece ...",
            "content": "\"Sunset Blvd.\"' left such an impression on me I sincerely doubt on the usefulness of this review. Everything has already been said about Billy Wilder's masterpiece, and I would only be paraphrasing the obvious. But I guess, such dilemmas are sterile ... so let's talk about one of the greatest American films ever, and my gut-feeling on that matter is that the success of \"Sunset Blvd.\" is particularly ironical.The principal irony is that one of the greatest American classics is precisely the one that deconstructed the myth of Hollywood. \"Sunset Blvd.\" resonates as a cinematic pamphlet against the corruption of minds that governs a quite decadent business. Billy Wilder, was a respected and admired artist, and yet he did the epitome of iconoclast films. Some may say it cost the movie its ticket for the Best Picture winner, which went to the eternal rival \"All About Eve\", another great classic that had the good taste to attack the less glamorous stage world. \"Sunset Blvd.\" kills the myth in the pinnacle of its Golden Age, denouncing the way silent stars are treated like old relics, how young starlets are exploited, and how for one or two chosen, many contenders will end up working for B-movies or in peripheral jobs. Hollywood studios are sure a ruthless universe. The word \"iconoclast\" holds also a double meaning since it really kills the icons within the Icon. The film had probably shocked, but by deliberately choosing the cynical approach, it was ahead of its time and never lost its relevance ever since, no sir.The second irony is that by deconstructing the same myth, it has prevented it from sinking into oblivion. Let's face it, many movies glorified the Golden Age of Hollywood, yet the only one that had the guts to criticize it, indirectly reminds of how great and irreplaceable these days were. Hollywood couldn't have had a better homage than a movie like \"Sunset Blvd\", as cynical and detached as Joe Gillis' narration sounds, it still speaks Hollywood's true language. And I'd go further, I'm sure Gloria Swanson would have been totally forgotten had this role not been given to her. Through Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson was immortalized and forever remembered as that actress with the unforgettable look and who portrayed one of the greatest cinematic characters ever. Yes, we know there was Mary Pickford, Lillian Gish, but I'm sure these actresses are more names and faces for movie fans while Gloria Swanson immediately reminds of \"Sunset Blvd.\".And this is the third ironic aspect of the film, the movie is believable because almost everyone is playing his own role. Gloria Swanson was indeed a has-been star forgotten by her peers, Erich Von Stroheim a has-been director whose disastrous \"Queen Kelly\", starring \u2013guess who- Gloria Swanson, derailed both careers. It was that film she was screening to William Holden. The self-reflexive aspect is so well-constructed you need to watch the film a second time, to realize that the characters within the actors were also playing a game. Joe, the struggling screenwriter exploiting Norma's love to have time to get back on the business, and Norma exploiting Joe's need to make her comeback and be with him, and as the band leader of a grotesque masquerade, the butler, Max, Erich Von Strohem who maintains Norma in total denial, literally directing her life. It's all about living in illusions, like the doomed love between a woman alienated by her own image and a man totally disillusioned. \"Sunset Blvd.\" Is simply fascinating.But I must add that the story is only one of the many fascinating elements that make the film a classic among the classics. Never had a movie combined such a close to perfect writing with an incredible direction, it's Wilder at the top of his game. When you think of any of the most iconic lines of the film, and it sure is full of them, you immediately associate an atmosphere, a darkness, a face. The cinematography, the direction perfectly convey the creepiness and moral ambiguities of film-noir. \"Sunset Blvd\" is a masterpiece for totally objective reasons, one of the rare films, it is impossible to find any flaw in it. From the beginning till the end, the impression, the film leaves on you is its indecent closeness to perfection.And I can't end without mentioning the title \"Sunset Boulevard\" which works as a beautiful metaphor of the end of an era. An end forever incarnated by the creepy mansion of Gloria Swanson, this lady with hands and arms that wave as the tentacles that tried in private to take the poor Joe Gillis as a sentimental hostage. And despite all his suaveness, and manly confidence, Joe is just a ghost writer, when Norma is an actress absorbed by her own image, and one man, Max who directs her life, or does he? Who controls these people anyway, they are all guided by their own love for their business ... and the genre, the opening, the setting of the film will respect your intelligence enough not to get you expecting a happy ending. Or was it? In a certain way, Joe was still the ghost writer in the real sense of the word, Norma was still acting, being the heroine of her twisted imagination, facing the cameras, and under the direction of Max who knew the only language that could make Norma Desmond receptive.And this is the beauty of the film, beyond the darkness, it's just an incredible and unforgettable introspection into the world of cinema. I could speak longer about the film, but I think I made my point now, but this is the beauty. It's just me, and the laptop, and those beautiful people out there behind their screens. All right, IMDb, I'm ready to submit ...",

            "content": "(Some Spoilers) As the sun rises over Sunset Blvd. we see the bullet riddled body of Hollywood screenwriter Joseph Gillis, William Holden, flouting face down in one of the streets multi-million dollar exclusive mansions swimming pool. We get the story from Gillis himself, in an emotionless and disembodied voice, as he recounts the series of events that happened to him that eventually put him there.Gillis had hit hard times and was about to lose his car, a 1946 Plymouth Convertible, to his creditors. Trying like hell to get the $290.00 to keep the car Gillis came up short and decided to skip town ,with the car, until the heat blows over or he somehow got the cash to pay off the car loan. It's then almost by accident that Gillis got involved with legendary silent film star Norma Desmond, Gloria Swanson, in who's mansion garage he ditched his disabled, from a flat tire, Plymouth. Norma together with her loyal butler Max (Erich Von Stroheim), whom we later finds out was her first husband, mistakes Gillis for the man form the City Health Department or ASPCA guy who was called to take her dear departed pet chimpanzee away for burial. It's when Norma finds out that Gillis is a Hollywood screenwriter she dreams up plans in her delusional mind for him to write her a role that she can make her long awaited comeback, or return as Norma calls it, to the silver screen.Grateful at first to Norma for giving him a place to stay Gillis works night and day in coming up with a screenplay worthy of her long awaited return to the movies. As things soon turn out it's only Norma, not her many millions of adoring fans, who's the only one who's enthusiastic about her long awaited return to films and no one else! It soon gets to Gillis to just how unstable Norma is in that he tries to keep the truth from her that's she's, at 50, too old and over the hill to play the parts that made her the Hollywood legend that she's become. While all this is going on Norma becomes very attached to Gillis in him feeding her all this hogwash, just to keep her from cracking up, in how great her forthcoming movie, that's if any studio is willing to finance it, is going to be with her in the staring role of \"Salome the Dancing Temptress.\"As things soon turn out it's Norma who becomes desperately dependent on Gillis not the other way around in needing him to keep her company in her spacious mansion, that has eight master bedrooms, and even become her lover! That with ex-husband Max making sure that Norma's living in the fantasy world that she conjured up for herself over the years! Gillis just about had enough of Norma's antics when his new found girlfriend Betty, Nancy Olsen, who just happens to be his best friend's Artie, Jack Webb, fianc\u00e9e found out about his strange relationship with her and walked out on him. Packing his bags and leaving Norma for good Gillis never realized how far Norma would go to keep him until it was too late! It was that fatal decision on Gillis' part that landed him in Norma's swimming pool where we first saw him at the beginning of he movie!Unforgettable climax with Norma now completely out of her mind acting as if she's doing her big scene, close-up and all, in her favorite director C.B DeMile's latest motion picture. That was the only way that Norma's now distraught butler and ex-husband Max could coax her into turning herself over to the police for the murder of her good friend and house-mate the luckless and now gone forever Joseph Gillis!",

            "content": "A movie filled with heart-ache, love, tragedy, and ambition, Sunset Boulevard is one of the most interesting to have ever been on screen. It's plot is one of the rare ones that takes the viewer behind the scenes and into the Hollywood realm, albeit probably not painting the most accurate of pictures, but still adding to our, as viewers, limited knowledge of the Hollywood world.  This movie is about desires and wants. There is the desire of the penniless writer to make it big and then there is the desire of the actress to know that she is still beautiful and wanted.Norma Desmond, played by Gloria Swanson, is a glamorous film star whose career abruptly ends with the introduction of talking pictures. And sadly enough, she is caught in her memories of a time when she was viewed as beautiful and glamorous not realizing that the world around her is still moving on. In Norma's lifetime, being a film star was all about the cinematic gaze and how it showed her. There was no sound to tell if an actress was good or not. The camera can make or break a person. She knew what made her popular and that was being under the constant scrutiny of the camera, of having it always on her. Sadly, when that phase of her life ended, she didn't know what to do with herself.  Most women are objectified on film by the camera, the director, the audience, etc. and most would try and distance themselves from that but oddly enough Norma wants to be surveyed. She wants to be scrutinized or praised or whatever else, as long as she is getting the attention she craves. I suppose Norma feels that this attention is what she needs to be happy. Attention and approval from others is what kept her going and without it she became a pitiful woman. And the littlest bit of approval she gets makes her feel that much more important but when its revealed the fan letters she receives are from her butler, once her husband, you can't help but feel sorry for her. Overall I think that you will love this movie. The cinematography is incredible and creates an amazing setting and atmoshpere. The movie shows the worst sides of what some view as the most glamorous lifestyle and way to live.",

            "content": "Although I long ago taped every Billy Wilder movie off TV I can't resist seeing them again on the Big Screen as part of the Wilder retrospective running at the NFT in November and December. Every movie Wilder wrote and directed was on the Great side of Good but seeing all the titles in print in a brochure reinforces just how many GREAT movies he made. Somehow he contrived to make two back to back just as the forties gave way to the fifties and then damned if he didn't do the very same thing as the fifties in turn became the sixties. The first two were Ace In The Hole and Sunset Boulevard, the second Some Like It Hot and The Apartment and I've yet to mention Double Indemnity (only his THIRD At Bat as a writer-director in America), The Lost Weekend, Stalag 17, Sabrina, A Foreign Affair, One, Two, Three, etc. If ever a film NOT made by Orson Welles had 'masterpiece' written all over it Sunset Boulevard is that movie. Every frame is touched with genius and in this film Wilder elevates Biting The Hand That Feeds You to an Art Form. Everyone and his Uncle Max knows by now the story of how third-rate writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) fetches up in the Gothic manse of has-been Screen Goddess Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and winds up as a gigolo and ultimately a dead gigolo but over and above the storyline it is the 'touches' that make this so great both in dialogue (Betty: How've you been keeping yourself lately? Joe: Actually I haven't been keeping myself lately) and visuals: Norma Desmond represents a bygone era and ironically it is Cecil B DeMille (playing himself) who tells Norma how far pictures have progressed and is THEN revealed to be directing wearing the riding breeches which were de riguer for movie directors IN THE SILENT ERA, a wonderful, typical and classic Wilder statement. It would be superfluous to merely repeat what other posters have said here but we can never repeat the word Masterpiece too often in connection with this movie.",

The entire cast and crew shine here, from the set people, the actors, the writers, the director, and so on.

The slightly mad Swanson sets him up in her massive rundown house. She wants him to write a screenplay that will put her back in the limelight. Erich Von Stroheim plays the butler and man Friday to Swanson and the estate. He is the former first husband of Swanson. Holden is plied with expensive gifts, fine clothes, watches and gold cigar cases etc. It puts a roof over his head so he stays on. It all gets a bit creepy for Holden when Swanson swears that she loves him. Needless to say this is going nowhere good for Mister Holden. I will say no more about the story, but if you are a Holden fan, you need to treat yourself to this masterpiece.

            "content": "More than a half century after \"Sunset Blvd.,\" audiences are well aware that Hollywood is not all glitz and glamor -- that there's a stark reality. Yet despite that knowledge, \"Sunset Blvd.\" is still an eye-opening and deeply affecting motion picture today as it was in the 1950s. Because even though our \"access\" to Hollywood is greater than that of yesteryear, great film-making and chilling performances are timeless and that's what this classic delivers.Billy Wilder was already famous for his string of films in the mid-late '40s, but \"Sunset Blvd.\" is in a category of its own. There's something shockingly real about this noir drama. Maybe it's the fact that actress Gloria Swanson, who plays faded silent film star Norma Desmond, was in need of a comeback herself, or that famous director Cecil B. DeMille plays a big role as himself, or that several old silent film stars such as Hedda Hopper and Buster Keaton appear in the movie as Norma's friends. It's kind of enchanting really, but doubly so because of the suspenseful tone of the film.\"Sunset Blvd.\" is about a work-starved screenwriter named Joe Gillis (William Holden) who by coincidence ends up in the mansion of an old silent film star, Norma Desmond. Desmond has written herself a comeback (or return, as she prefers) role and convinces Gillis to redraft it. Oddly, however, she insists on him staying at her mansion, where he inevitably becomes her plaything.The script by Wilder and longtime collaborator Charles Brackett (along with D.M. Marshman Jr.) creates some awkward but powerful moments, such as a New Years Eve party where Gillis discovers he's the only guest. Although the beginning scene was a last-minute addition, the excellent shot of him floating in the pool is the first of many affecting images and scenes that Wilder has crafted with a touch of horror and creepiness to be truthful. Franz Waxman accentuates this tone with his suspenseful score.But it's way Gloria Swanson carries herself as the iconic Norma Desmond that generates the creepy effect. Head tilted back, she stares at you with those 1930s movie star eyes and moves her hands in such a manner that will terrify everyone just slightly. Not getting an Oscar win just goes to show what a great year for film 1950 was, though speculation is the film's mildly negative portrayal of the industry could have been partly responsible. All the main characters in this film got nods but lost out on the prize in fact -- and truth is all were deserving of being there.It's hard to see now, but Hollywood was all about reputation in those days. It was about the image and deceiving the public with glamorization of the business. \"Sunset Blvd.\" was a classic of its time for getting beneath the veil that Norma oh so cleverly has on when she goes to visit the great Mr. DeMille, but it's a classic for all-time because of the subtle haunting quality of Wilder's work and bewitching performance of Swanson.~Steven CVisit my site moviemusereviews.com",

            "content": "IMDb Top 250: 32I'm going to get this out of the way: it's hard for me to formulate coherent thoughts about Sunset Blvd. If you haven't yet seen the score, I loved it. LOVED it, like one of the few 10's I award love it. But it's a difficult film to describe, you simply have to experience this one-of- a-kind masterpiece.Sunset Blvd. follows hack (love that description) writer Joe Gilles, in the gutter, as he finds himself in the lap of eccentric silent star Norma Desmond, who is planning a comeback (\"It's a RETURN! I hate that word\") and wants Joe's aid. In a sentence, the film shows that relationship. But it's so much more than that. You see right from the start, beginning with very cool credits, it's also a murder mystery to constantly think about. It's also famously a look at Hollywood, post- sound transition. Where to start? The acting. Our narrator and protagonist(?) Joe is the cool, straight man in this odd tale, but like everything, he isn't a perfect person. His performance is however. We're never sure what side of the game he's playing, but he sure looks like he does.Joe may be the protagonist but Norma Desmond is the star. Up until today, if someone asked me to name an amazing female performance, I couldn't. But Gloria Swanson, in a role much like her life (minus the crazy) fully realized this intriguing character. She's a woman who can't let go of the past, someone unable to look forwards. we all know someone like that. And her \"development\"- she's a silent star alright.The whole thing has a creepiness to it, and I can draw several connections between this and 'Psycho'. Creepy isn't quite the word, 'queer' is a little more fitting. But it's unsettling, and a large chunk of that is Max, Norma's butler. His constant presence is freaky, his loyalty scary. Erich von Stroheim, a silent director, is perfectly cast in this role, even if he didn't like it much himself.It's remarkable how this echoed real life. Gloria Swanson plays a character who mirrors her own life, and is accompanied by one of her former directors. Cecil B DeMille, famed director, plays himself. Numerous other cameos happen as well, include one of my favourite scenes, where Norma plays bridge with other silent stars, namely Buster Keaton, who actually speaks. It's as though this really could've happened, these people really lived among the stars of the day. A film about writers has to have good writing, and Sunset Blvd. delivers in script, cinematography, and all technical aspects of film. The mansion is extravagant, a worthy choice for the Set Design Oscar. Also the music, while not iconic or even having a main theme, wonderfully plays along with the film,adding the extra level to a magnificent film.The plot wraps up eventually, and if you didn't know it was coming from the start then it would be a very strange finale indeed. All I'll say is it puts the narration in a different perspective, and the film scene (and line) are strange, creepy, and just excellent.There you have it, my glowing response to Sunset Blvd.There's only one thing: I can't identify a genre. A drama is too broad, a noir would be a little off, and it doesn't quite fit the bill to be a thriller. But maybe that's the spark that makes the film so great- there's nothing quite like it, and while it's timeless, there probably never will be anything like it again. 9.6/10",

            "content": "Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard is the blackly funny, often pitifully sad portrayal of a has-been silent star, alive as if against the knowledge of the outside world, in her misshapen manor, screening her old films, imagining unstoppably, relentlessly, of a return, that she is under the illusion will vindicate her fans, who all feel robbed of her. But it's also a disfigured love story, which while it keeps it from becoming simply a waxworks or a freak show, causes it to drag a little tiny bit.Gloria Swanson gives an unforgettable performance as the silent star Norma Desmond, with her covetous, melodramatic fingers, her theatrical gestures, her high-flying delusions of grandeur. William Holden considerately plays the role of the writer half her age, who lets himself be kept by her. But the performance that gives Swanson matching reverberation, relishing the film's Gothic grandiosity, is by Erich von Stroheim, as Norma's mysterious, devoted butler.The movie engraves itself on the doorstep of the world in which it is set, extracting so candidly from life in pictures that we can smell, lick, penetrate the special minutiae, the unequivocal parallels between the story and the actual actors themselves. What makes it so pitch perfect is how Wilder skates on thin ice flanked by black comedy and tragedy. Swanson's Norma Desmond slithers within millimeters of lampooning herself, taking huge chances with over-the-top sneers, affected lunges, theatrical posturings, and world-record- breaking narcissism, dangling Norma at the brink of psychosis for the vast majority of the movie, then creeping over. Norma obviously is not a wrinkly mummy. She is younger than stars such as Jane Fonda and Frances McDormand. She has aged only in her mind's eye, having grown obsessed obsessed obsessed with her moment of eminence in the past.What is most fun about Sunset Boulevard is how genuine Wilder had the wonderful nerve to be. He uses real names and shows real people, sometimes extensively. Sunset Boulevard gets to the bottom of the false impressions between audience and insider, and does not allow Norma Desmond to. The plot provides Holden with many reasons to agree to Norma's proposal of a job as her personal, hush-hush script doctor. He's bust, the rent is overdue, he is a fugitive from repo men, and he would hate to return to his job as a columnist in Ohio (It's always got to be Ohio! Why? What did we ever do to anybody?). He is as well not wholeheartedly reluctant to prostitute himself. Holden pitches faint fragility and internal struggle into his character. He goes through the forms of saying he doesn't want Norma's gifts, but he takes them, claims to be surprised on New Year's Eve when she throws a party just for the two of them, but surely he has known from the first that she wants not only a writer, but a young man to reassure her that she is still attractive. What is brilliantly satirical about all this is that in Hollywood, a screenwriter is so oppressed and low on the food chain that he will do anything to keep working. And what is furthermore brilliantly satirical is that Norma's life is not so bad. She's really her own worst enemy, which is what makes her story so pitiful.There is sure enough the young blonde studio writer with the highly predictable name of Betty, who is engaged to Jack Webb, but as Holden begins sneaking out of the house to work together on a script with her, she falls for him. He'd do her in a heartbeat, but he backs off, to a certain extent because he doesn't want her to find out the truth, but what's more because he shamefully likes the way of life with Norma. Wilder creates an exceedingly absorbing effect here, because when he escapes to see his old pal Jack Webb, and tension grows between him and Betty, Norma's world sure has gotten stuffy by that time and we feel a great deal of solace from her twisted realm.Of all the great directors of Hollywood's old days---Wyler, Stevens, Lang, Hitchcock---Billy Wilder was the biggest breath of fresh air. He knew how to blast a fun-loving sense of humor at you even in the face of knowingly pathetic subjects and characters. And he could go straight to the other extreme in the same film, outright disturbing you more than you ever thought a film from the old days ever could. Double Indemnity, Ace in the Hole, Some Like It Hot, The Seven Year Itch, The Apartment, The Lost Weekend, Stalag 17, Witness for the Prosecution, Sabrina and Sunset Boulevard all have a great comforting quality at the same time they are helmed by the silent man behind the camera who you never think about, the sublime master of mood swings, not to mention he consistently shows his strong sense of the importance of a memorable closing line, closing shot.",

            "content": "\"Sunset Boulevard\" is considered to be one of the quintessential Hollywood films.  It takes a bitingly satirical look at what makes Hollywood work. However, beneath its surface it is more than just that. It's a uniquely strange look what happens to a prima donna who's fallen from her high horse.Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a young, down on his luck Hollywood writer. He's just scraping by, trying to hide his car from repo men.  He winds up in the house of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an aging silent film star who is working on her comeback screenplay.  She gives Joe the job of fixing the screenplay, although her aim is basically to have him for company.The characters are well formed and incredibly well acted, specifically in Joe and Norma.  They are three dimensional - each has their own internal struggles and desires.  Joe, on one hand, relies on Norma to keep up his good life that it has, but on the other hand wants to go out and be with the girl that he loves.  Norma is stuck in the delusion, kept up by her butler Max (Erich von Stroheim), that she is still famous.Holden and Swanson perform their parts brilliantly.  Holden is the man trapped, with no way out.  Swanson overacts, intentionally, saying every line with such grandiosity that she perfectly captures the way Norma feels about herself and her perceived stardom.This movie is about a woman who was once great and has fallen.  She reacts to it not with acceptance, but an unconscious denial.  She, along with Max, has convinced herself that she is still a star with legions of fans.  Joe keeps up the charade because of everything that he is offering her.  The idea of the middle aged woman keeping the young man for company is genuinely strange, but it fits the picture that Norma is trapped in the past, and fails to move on, but rather deny it.\"Sunset Boulevard\" is a brilliant movie.  It works on two levels - as a satire about the hollowness of fame and Hollywood, and also as a look at what happens when one has fallen from grace.  Its status as one of the greatest movies of the era is certainly well earned, and it has certainly survived the test of time.**** out of ****",

To give it a 10 is an insult.I've lost track of how many times I've seen this film ... close to 50 would be my guess. How many movies can you watch that many times and the movie remains just as perfect, just as entertaining, just as enthralling and fascinating each time you watch it? Very few, that's for sure! Gloria Swanson was simply perfection in this movie. What a brilliant casting move on Billy Wilder's part! And what a performance Swanson gave. Her theatrics and eye movements were so dead-on ... but then what else could we expect from a genuine mega-star from the silent screen era, playing a faded mega-star from the silent screen era? What a totally unself-conscious portrayal. One of the best screen portrayals ever, in my opinion.Von Stroheim as the butler / former silent director ... again, genius. Erich von Stroheim made some GREAT pictures in his day, I mean VERY GREAT (can you say \"Greed\"?), but ended up on the outs in Hollywood thanks to his legendary ego and his battles with Thalberg. How perfect to get a dethroned former major silent director to play a has-been silent director! Remember, it may be de rigeur nowadays for actors to play characters that mock their former selves (a la William Shatner and his newfound popularity), but this was half a century ago when Billy Wilder and Gloria Swanson and von Stroheim pioneered this type of tongue-in-cheek, knowing self-referentialism.And William Holden ... handsome, sarcastic, jaded, sexy-voiced William Holden as the down-and-out writer who turns gigolo. His character is only about 30 years old, but already the Hollywood system has chewed him up and spit him out. He can't even pay his rent or his car loan. His dry, witty, noir-esquire narration of the story adds yet another layer of perfection to this 11-out-of-10 movie.What else is there to say? How does one adequately describe perfection?

Gloria Swanson and Eric Von Stroheim playing washed up relics of the Silent Era was perfect.There is never a sex scene between Swanson and Holden, something that modern producers would probably have insisted on (tastefully shot, of course).

The script contains many unforgettable lines others have already quoted here.What I can say is that this film is modern in a way no other film of its time really is.  Each time I've seen it I can't beleive it's from 1950, its thematic elements just seem so fresh.  Sunset Boulevard may seem familar to us with our current cultural obsession with celebrity and especially celebrity downfalls.  We watch the E! True Hollywood Story, Star Dates, and the lowest nadir of all, Celebrity Boxing.  I don't any other film, fact or fiction, has equalled this film in treating the theme of Hollywood's dangers.At the end of the film Norma Desmond, with the newsreel cameras on her, is sickly elated at being back in the celluloid eye, despite the fact she'd just killed her lover.  The fact that celebrities today humiliate themselves on second rate cable networks and Fox spectacles attests to the outright addiction of fame.William Holden's character also attests to the oft-invoked \"Boulevard of broken dreams.\"  This is a theme explored recently by David Lynch in Mulholland Drive (which I think owes something to Sunset Boulevard), though not as successfully.  So, to add to the praises others here have heaped upon it and Billy Wilder, I would say that this film's surprising relevance could make it accessible to those who might not fancy older films.

            "content": "Sunset Boulevard is a great movie because it contains a tragic story which makes the movie a compelling work of drama. Gloria Swanson and William Holden portray complex characters, one a washed up actress and the other a failed screen writer, with personal needs that conflict. One needs love and the other one money. This simple formula provides the basis for a great movie.We know from the start that the principal male character, Joe Gillis, is dead and that the story is a flash back. This flash back hooks the audience's attention. We know that Joe has a story to tell, one that is worth listening to because something bad happened to him, and the question now is: why? The movie explains why. Joe, by chance, gets involved with a wealthy but emotionally unstable woman, Norma, who is in a position to cater to Joe's material needs. All Norma wants in return is Joe's love, a love that Joe does not feel for Norma. Now, Joe has a conflict: stay with Norma, whom he does not love, although he loves her money, or leave Norma and go back to where he came from, which is poverty row. Either way, Joe loses. How Joe goes about trying to resolve this conflict is what drives this story. The needier Norma gets, the more frantic Joe becomes. Joe describes himself as a heel. That's because he feels guilty over the way he is treating Norma. Joe's guilt feelings show that fundamentally he is a decent guy who does not know how to extricate himself from an impossible situation. If we did not know what happens to Joe from the start, his situation would seem comical: an eccentric middle-aged woman lavishing gifts on a younger man who is too much of a wimp to say no. Joe Gillis could be played by Adam Sandler or a younger Dustin Hoffman. Indeed, The Graduate reprises the older woman-younger man motif. But unlike The Graduate, where feathers are ruffled but nobody dies, in Sunset Boulevard the story is far from amusing; it is tragic. Joe dies and Norma loses what is left of her sanity. No one wins. Norma makes a grand exit to the police and Joe makes an exit too: to the morgue. That this happens in Hollywood gives the story a sardonic twist. Norma and Joe finally achieve the notoriety that they craved, but at a price.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder's 'Sunset Boulevard' is a film about Hollywood. It is not concerned with the happy, idealised version of Hollywood that we would usually expect, but rather it offers a darker, more cynical outlook on the subject, a potent mixture of drama, romance and black comedy. Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a failed hack screenwriter whose car is about to be repossessed. When he stumbles upon a broken-down mansion, he comes to meet silent screen star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), whose career floundered with the arrival of talkies, but who still maintains delusions of her own fame and grandeur. When Norma offers Joe money to edit the script for her big comeback, he simply can't resist the opportunity, completely oblivious to the fact that, by the time the events of the film are over, he will be dead.Very curiously, the film is shown in flashback form, narrated by Joe Gillis from beyond the grave. We first come across him floating lifelessly in Norma Desmond's pool, surrounded by detectives and photographers. The original edit of the film opened in a morgue, with the assembled corpses \u0096 Joe included \u0096 discussing how they came to be here. However, audiences considered the scene so ludicrous that they were unsure whether to approach the rest of the film as a drama or a comedy. After the removal of this opening scene, audiences reacted more favourably, and Joe Gillis' post-death voice-over adds a darkly humorous touch to the film, also successfully evoking the feel of a classic film-noir, of which Billy Wilder was a veteran (see 'Double Indemnity (1944)' for an archetypal classic of the genre).'Sunset Boulevard' really is a surprisingly contemptuous anti-tribute to Hollywood. Aside from casting Gloria Swanson as the long-forgotten silent star (who, herself, had struggled to adapt to the introduction of sound films), Wilder also makes somewhat sadistic use of Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson and H.B. Warner. In a brief cameo appearance (credited as themselves), and described by Joe as \"waxworks,\" the three silent stars play similarly \"has-been\" actors who attend a bridge game at Norma's mansion. Furthermore, Erich von Stroheim \u0096 who plays Norma's sinister servant, former-director and first husband, Max \u0096 is forced to sit through a screening of 'Queen Kelly,' a disastrous unfinished 1929 film in which he directed a younger Gloria Swanson.Re-enforcing the theme that a certain level of corruption has seeped into new Hollywood, many of the characters are portrayed as being deceitful or manipulative. In a futile bid for self-validation and intimacy, Norma manipulates Joe into staying at her mansion, even threatening suicide on numerous occasions to prevent him from leaving her. Joe, on the other hand, exploits Norma's misguided delusions of success to provide him with financial security. Nonetheless, it is to Wilder's credit that he makes both of these characters appear somewhat sympathetic to the audience. By the end of the film, Joe partly compensates for his devious past behaviour, coming clean with Norma and convincing young budding writer, Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), that she would be happier with her fianc\u00e9 (Jack Webb) than with him. However, in typical Wilder fashion, having finally learned an important lesson about life, Joe is promptly rewarded with his own murder.By showing the decline of many of old Hollywood's finest stars, Wilder hints at the corruptive, devastating influences of new Hollywood, and of the modern studio system. This view was not accepted kindly by some in the industry; producer Louis B. Mayer famously confronted the director in public, declaring that \"you have disgraced the industry that made and fed you. You should be tarred and feathered and run out of Hollywood.\" Fortunately, most in Hollywood disagreed, and 'Sunset Boulevard' was honoured with eleven Academy Award nominations, including three wins (Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music and Best Writing). Paradoxically, whilst the film explores the tragic degradation of Hollywood at the turn of the 1950s, this Billy Wilder masterpiece proves beyond doubt that, in that era, Hollywood film-making was in a golden age.",

William Holden (Rachel And The Sranger, The Earthling) plays Joe Gillis, a bankrupt B-movie writer who drives his car into the garage of an apparently abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard to dodge the repo men. But the dilapidated place is occupied by two fascinating but weird characters, former silent screen star Norma Desmond (Goria Swanson) and her butler, balding, German-accented Max (Erich von Stroheim). Norma hires Joe to ghost-write a screenplay for her come-back, but he soon finds he's as much a kept-man as a writer, enabling more than one of the has-been starlet's delusions. The characters of both Norma and Max are fascinating enough to keep the movie going, and their relationship turns out to be more than it seems. The cast includes a very young Jack Webb, actually speaking like a human being, and appearances by Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper, and Cecil B. DeMille as themselves. Carol Burnett made great fun of the role with Harvey Korman in the Max role 2 decades later, but the movie (directed and co-written by Billy Wilder) remains a grand drama, character study, and serious comment on the Hollywood star system.",

I would rank this with \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"The Manchurian Candidate\" as one of the greatest satires. Wilder is able to keep a balance between absurd parody and intelligent commentary. He very evocatively portrays the corrupting influence of the Hollywood establishment.All the actors are perfectly suited for their roles. Holden is great as the desperate and ultimately lonely writer Joe Gillis. He is willing to do most anything to keep alive his hopes of becoming a great screenwriter. He remains sympathetic of Norma (as I do), and yet disgusted by her (as I do). Swanson is almost perfect as Norma Desmond. She is grandiose, grotesque, and pitiful. She is able to disguise her true emotion with over-exaggerated melodrama.Several times on the DVD it is noted that Wilder is not considered a great visual director. I think his visuals are above par, and very effective. The scene in which Norma and Joe are watching her silent picture is a good example. She stands up into the projector light with a Gothic, almost surreal appearance. It is as though she exists merely as a two-dimensional projection. In her mind, there is no world outside of the silver screen. The New Year's Eve party is another. There is an overhead shot of Norma and Joe dancing on the tiled floor. You see Norma and Joe all alone amongst the opulence of the house. They really only have each other. As we see, they cannot exist without each other. It is just them and no one else.

            "content": "Rumor has it that Gloria Swanson was absolutely devastated that she didn't win the Oscar for Sunset Boulevard. 1950 was an unusually tough year for competitors, with the statuette eventually going to Judy Holiday for Born Yesterday. Admittedly, Gloria is fantastic in this film - she's able to send up herself, while also scandalizing the business she was product of - but the acting chops must really go to William Holden, who provides the willful self-loathing thread that ties much of this noirish and twisted tale together. Director by Billy Wilder, Sunset Boulevard represents classic movie making at its peak. Set in Los Angeles, it's a dark, twisted, cynical tale of love, deceit, and opportunism. The film is all about Hollywood behind the scenes and how screenwriters, directors, and actors will sell themselves out for fame and fortune at a moments notice. Spiritual and emotional emptiness, and the price of fame, greed, narcissism, and ambition is at the heart of this devilishly stylistic film, with the somber mood beginning almost immediately when a dead man is found floating facedown in a swimming pool.The man is hack screenwriter Joe Gillis (a very sexy William Holden). All we know is that Joe was at the run-down mansion of deluded former silent-film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). Through Joe's voice over narrative it soon becomes clear that he was somehow involved with the wealthy Norma. Down on his luck, three months behind on his rent, and with his car about to be repossessed, Joe accidentally stumbles upon Norma's faded mansion while trying to escape the police. Norma initially mistakes Joe for a coffin-maker for her deceased pet monkey, but once she figures out that he's a screenwriter, she gets him to read one of the scripts she's been working on. Norma is an insane and faded silent-film star, who is hoping against hope to make a comeback. She's bitterly resentful of the price the \"talkies\" have taken on her career, so now she soaks in her own misguided and imagined greatness, in profile with the flickering projector lighting her outline in the dark. Joe is initially hesitant to help the glamorous woman, and then asks $500 a week for his writing services. But slowly we come to realize the contract is actually the other way around. In preparing for her return comeback, Norma quickly turns Joe into a pawn - or more to the point, a slave. Joe becomes a virtual prisoner in her rundown mansion; the moment he leaves, she slits her wrists, forcing him to come back. With minimal resistance, Joe allows himself to settle into the life of a kept man, as Norma desperately showers him with gifts and fine clothing. The house butler, Max von Meyerling (Erich von Stroheim), grimly looks on, tending to Norma's demanding whims and tolerating Joe's disruptive presence.Joe wobbles back and forth between heedless acceptance of his strange companionship with Norma and his half-hearted pursuit of a career. He sneaks away to collaborate on a project with Betty (Nancy Olson), a Paramount script reader who is engaged to Joe's best friend. Betty is gradually falling in love with Joe, but when Norma finds out, that he's been sneaking out to meet wit her, all hell breaks loose. The self-loathing motif is rampant throughout Sunset Boulevard. Max completely does away with his self-respect, Joe hates himself for his unwillingness to commit to a career or love, and seems to sell himself out for money and clothes almost immediately, and Betty despises herself for falling in love with Joe while she's engaged to another. Norma, despite her haughtiness, is the most blatant case of self-disgust. When she isn't raving about her greatness, she comes across as a frightened and tortured soul \u0096 a sad and lonely woman, who is not only remarkably self-delusional, but is also trying to grasp one last chance at happiness. She thinks so little of her current 50-year-old self that she no longer acknowledges the present. Sunset Boulevard is a must see movie for cinema buffs. There are lots of treasures to be had here, including Nancy Olson's strangely under appreciated performance as Betty, whose misguided love for Joe spirals the film to its grisly conclusion. There's also the hilarious appearance of a skinny and madly grinning Jack Webb as a happy-go-lucky assistant director, and viewers will get a kick out of the excessive exuberance that Norma displays when she towels down a hunky and hairy-chested Joe at poolside. The funniest scene in the movie is when Norma rolls on top of Joe while he is reclining on a couch, and then does an imitation of Charlie Chaplin in order to cheer him up; the scene is an uproarious mixture of the sad, the funny, and the pathetic. Billy Wilder's accomplished direction is full of wide shots that capture the depressing set and brave close-ups of our anti-heroes. But in the end, Sunset Boulevard stands out, as one of the finest examples of the frenzied circus of obsession, fixation, and greed that is oftentimes symbolizes Hollywood.

In my opinion however \u2013 because I'm amazed to find there are comments on the IMDb actually trashing it, but surely by people who also would regard a random pile of bricks as more arty than the Mona Lisa. Director Billy Wilder churned out some remarkable groundbreaking films, some being works of Art that have and will obviously outlast everything made over the last 50 years. I feel I know it off by heart having seen it so many times over the decades, but still come away impressed.Young and penniless film script writer (Holden) falls into the clutches of ageing ex-silent movie star (Swanson), takes the job of producing a worthwhile script for her and gradually becomes her toyboy to boot. Being red blooded he chafes at his position but feels he has no other option but to play ball. The plot moves smoothly and logically from A to Z, paying so much attention to detail it's no wonder a few tiny goofs crept in, like the film crew visible in Swanson's sunglasses. I don't count the unrealistic lack of blood on display from gunshots when after all the dead man is narrating the entire film. The production values were sky-high, the nitrate photography impeccable, the acting and the plot topnotch and believable. Favourite bits: Holden's expression upon seeing the dead monkey; Holden pegging butler Stroheim as slightly cuckoo; Holden and Swanson watching her and Stroheim's Queen Kelly on the big screen in her living room; buying the vicu\u00f1a overcoat (and how good he looked in it too!); on the Paramount lot with DeMille; so many more.If Wilder was still young and making films nowadays no doubt they'd be full of mindless cgi cartoonery, sex and violence because it's required now discipline's dead, but Sunset Blvd was almost perfect, intelligent film making at its best.",

There's a little bit of scene-setting before we even see the corpse, with the narrator chatting away, seemingly with no particular aim; and by the time he gets around to using the word \"I\", which lets us know that this is HIS story, we've already cut to a flashback, which makes it quite easy for the viewer to miss the implied point (which is not, in the end, all that important) that we're listening to the words of a dead man.According to Otto Friedrich's \"City of Nets\", the original script's opening scene would have left us in no doubt.  Wilder had planned to show us bodies lying around in a morgue, with tags on their toes; suddenly, a few of the bodies would sit up, and start swapping stories about how they died.  Then Joe would get around to telling how HE died, etc., etc.  Apparently nobody liked this gruesome prologue, and Friedrich himself professes relief that Wilder's associates managed to talk him out of it.  I think the original prologue was a WONDERFUL idea: its brash insolence could only have helped the film.  Oh, well.  The more muted, inexplicit opening Wilder went with in the end is still a remarkably strong one.The film that follows is an enigma.  You've got to love the haunted mansion (haunted by a star of the silent era who is very much alive, even if her career is dead), and the sharp chromatic ditty that forms the basis of Franz Waxman's score, which worms its way into our heads and then NAGS us about something, although it's hard to say what; you've got to love seeing Wilder at his most visually eloquent (he may have been better with words than images, but he still had a better grasp of what to do with the camera than most directors), working with a script that manages to convey heavy fatalism while leaving us in constant doubt as to where it's going to go next. Perhaps the only reason I feel this falls JUST short of being Wilder at his best is that I can't even tell where it got to in the end.  Is there a moral?  It FEELS as though there is - but what is it?Don't believe anyone who says that this is some kind of Hollywood expos\u00e9. We know how dull THEY are...  The expos\u00e9 element turns out to be a trivial part of the overall picture, anyway.  A brief, almost casually included conversation with Cecil B. DeMille reveals that Norma was driven mad not by anything that happened recently, not even by the years of neglect, but just over twenty years earlier, at the height of her success - and it was the excesses of the silent-era star system that did it.  The more muted Hollywood of 1950 Wilder depicts may actually be a healthier place.Or it may not be.  It's not the film's concern either way.",

But I still find it to be a long, flimsy, obvious movie with one static, overly drawn-out relationship, and a lazy second storyline with the blandest of bland characters. The whole concept is ridiculous. Who wanted to see the story of a failed writer, with the low ambition of being a kept boy, who squints his eyes and makes love to a horrible old shrew because he can't grow a pair to blow her off. That's the whole show for three quarters of the movie. A viewer just isn't asked to do much but pay attention. To make up for how little the story moves, it has a lot of over-the-top acing. I don't find it entertaining or particularly thoughtful. Wilder's run of remarkable movies has impressed me (except this, The Apartment and Some like it Hot). This would be the lesser half of a double bill with the similar Great Expectations, Vertigo or Streetcar Named Desire. I cannot imagine how excruciating this would be as a musical.",

Her performance is riddled with theatrics but that's exactly what the character calls for. The fact that she didn't win the Best Actress Oscar for this role beggars belief. Swanson, Holden, Stroheim & Olson all received acting nominations but none took home any hardware, despite fine performances all around.There are a couple of likely reasons for the film's relatively small haul on Oscar night. First of all, the film was up against another classic, \"All About Eve\", which had garnered a record 14 nominations. Then, there was the scathing screenplay authored by Wilder, Brackett & Marshman. In particular, the story does a fine job of reflecting the amoral quest for success and the narcissism of the famous, hardly the image that Hollywood wanted to convey.Billy Wilder's direction here is well-handled and there are several moments of greatness, such as the famous ending. In that scene Wilder's direction, Swanson's acting and Waxman's score combine to produce what is surely one of the most memorable endings to any film ever.There's a reason (several, actually) why this film is considered among the greatest of all time.

The sets are great and really shine in the deep-focus cinematography that reminded me of Citizen Kane.Gloria Swanson plays her role with authenticity, it was a version of herself she played, as her last great role stemmed from the thirties. The fragment shown in the film is Queen Kelly, directed by Erich Von Stroheim, another actor whose role was close to reality. Above all Wilder showed a cynicism far ahead of its time, sure it was already present in films such as The Life and Death of 9413: a Hollywood Extra in the late twenties, but such films were not made by the great directors of Hollywood itself. This sharp depiction of the darker sides of Hollywood, i.e. the corruption, the exploitation of people, the Machiavellian attitude towards personal gain, is a big part why this film did not win the Oscar for best film in 1950. The reasons why the academy disliked it are the same reasons why I love it.I can finally see why David Lynch referenced this film in the beginning of Mulholland Dr..",

The central message - a look at the Hollywood film making system, which caused loads of controversy at the time of initial release - remains interesting, especially for movie enthusiasts and film makers, but if you are just looking for a good classic thriller from director Billy Wilder, \"Double Indemnity\" would be a safer choice.After the intriguing opening, many of the scenes in the center film drag on and the atmosphere is much less than desired from what you'd expect from such a film.

Yet, as we watch, we realize more and more that she is brainwashed into thinking she is still the star she once was. Wilder and Brackett have tremendous fun in this tremendous script that has to be one of the best ever written. It is so cleverly written, with touches of comedy, romance, and drama that it is hard to understand what type of film this is. To put it bluntly, this is revenge on Hollywood. And it continues to hold up today with all that is happening in films. See it once for its quality film-making, but see it again for the smacks Wilder puts on Hollywood.

Gloria Swanson almost didn't agree to acting in the film, but personally I am glad she didn't since no one else would probably have been able to play the part of Norma Desmond, the used to be star.

William Holden plays a B-movie screenwriter struggling in Hollywood and about to get his car repossessed when he pulls into a driveway of an old mansion owned by a silent screen star, played by Gloria Swanson, who has long faded from the public's and Hollywood's memory and lives as a recluse. Her butler, played by Eric Von Stroheim, is the first of her three husbands and who as former director discovered her. Holden grabs an opportunity to live in the mansion and write a screenplay for the Norma Desmond character's comeback to films. She falls in love with him with designs on him being her fourth husband and things start unraveling. Also in the cast are Nancy Olson, Fred Clark, Jack Webb and in wonderfully scripted cameo roles are a cast of stars from the silent movie era, director Cecil B. DeMille, actor-comedian Buster Keaton, actress Ann Q. Nilsson, actress-turned present day gossip columnist Hedda Hopper and actor H.B Warren. Stroheim is also from the silent era as is Swanson herself. She made 58 silent films in just 16 years between 1914 and 1930 and was one of Hollywood's biggest names but only made five films in the 30's and by 1934 with the film Music in the Air at age 37 her career ended. She returned in 1941 to make a comeback film but disappeared again until she got the role in Sunset Boulevard at the age of 53. A role she played so convincingly that it would typecast her as Norma Desmond and she only made one other film before disappearing from the big screen once again. She would show up occasionally on television and made a couple more screen roles late in her life. John Seitz is the film's cinematographer who himself got his start photographing silent films in a long 45 year career where he was never out of work. He had been the cinematographer on such silent film classics as The Prisoner of Zenda, The Arab, and Scarmouche to name a few so he was an ideal choice to photographer this film. His career also would go on to include The Lost Weekend, The Big Clock, Double Indemnity and Sullivan's Travels. Famed writer director Billy Wilder was making a name for himself and had already directed such pictures as The Lost Weekend, A Foreign Affair and Double Indemnity. Wilder wrote the screenplay with Charles Brackett and D.M. Marshman Jr. The film was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won three for Best Art Direction, Best Music Score and Best Screenplay. among it's 11 nominations were Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Editing and a heavily nominated cast in Holden for Best Actor, Swanson for Best Actress, Olson for Best Supporting Actress and Von Stroheim for Best Supporting Actor. The Academy Awards for 1950 were All About Eve vs. Sunset Boulevard with the two films nominated for a total of 25 awards with nine nominations between the two casts alone. Sunset Boulevard also won four Golden Globe Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress and Best Score and received an additional three Globe nominations. It's film noir, drama, satire, dark comedy and comes close to a horror story too. If you like any or all of those genre categories you'll like this film. If you have an appreciation for the silent era films as I do you'll like this even more. I give it a 10 out of 10.",

And today, I have just read of the death of the great Billy Wilder. This has prompted me to write my first review, on the IMDB, of my favourite of this man's long series of great films and screenplays.Sunset Blvd is suspenseful, witty, and tragic. Brilliantly written and directed, it is a classic for many reasons, but most notably that it is possible to like the movie more each time with each viewing. It may not be possible to appreciate such a detailed and rich film in one viewing. Whether it be the real Hollywood stars in cameos(Buster Keaton, Cecil B. Demille etc), or the skillful casting of Gloria Swanson and Erich Von Stroheim, that adds such a grim reality to their, all ready, well written roles, to just how frank and bleakly honest this movie was for it's time, in it's portrayal of Hollywood.For William Holden, a very handsome Hollywood leading man, to take on the role of a poor bitter writer,Joe Gillis, was, I consider a brave role, even by many of todays leading man standards. Gloria Swanson prevents the character of Norma becoming a ridiculous caricature and keeps her real and therefore tragic.(None the less, Ms Swanson also gives a famously delicious performance in this feisty role) And Nancy Olsen, who plays a very grounded and honest, Betty Schaefer,  perfectly matches the unreality of the world of Norma Desmond.Goodbye, Billy Wilder.

Winning 3 Oscars and scooping plenty of other nominations, the story of the struggling screenwriter and failed actress has a level of humanity and realism to maintain its timeless classic tag.Oscar nominated William Holden (The Wild Bunch) opens the story by taking viewers back 6 months before a tragic event recalling how he ended up working for the neurotic Norma Desmond, cinemas once finest star. Holden's reflection on society and his desperation to work is charismatic, ensnaring and occasionally funny. The obsession with the car is witty and when he first appears on screen in dealing with the finance agents is cool and collected deceitful, establishing the character's core exceptionally well. But this charming on screen presence is overshadowed by an obsessive and starry-eyed portrayal of fame by Gloria Swanson as the unforgivably self obsessed actress.With the film world growing bigger each year we see more actors come and go and get lost in a whirlwind of controversy off camera. Gossip magazines are more concerned with the battles with diet and appearance and frankly it's amazing to see this depicted in a film made in the 1950's. Swanson is the symbol of today's modern stereotype. Once the star she descends into a world of obscurity and absentmindedness, lost in past glory before seeing the light and preparing herself for her comeback. \"I'm ready for my close up Mr DeMille\" is an unforgettable line and still remains powerful, with the performance stealing the scenes.The story itself representing the struggle of writing and surviving for the film industry is consistently accurate and interesting. The power of the bosses, the struggle of independent writers and penning the greatest novel ever reveal the desire and controversy of the industry.The inclusion of issues such as desire, lust, suicide and money add to the realism of Billy Wilder's acclaimed picture.Wilder chooses scenes carefully, maintain enough realism to make an almost fantasy about the story. The swimming pool scene and Norma's last scene are testament to the concept of madness of the film industry. This, from all the films I have seen, has one of the finest rounded off endings ever screened, perfectly pitched, entertaining and justification to the film's preaching morals of madness and the powers of film.The inclusion of an affair and a secret long lost crush add to the depth and drama of the film, which makes Sunset Boulevard packed with fine preaching issues, stunning acting and enough drama and interest to keep you hooked right until a stunning end",

            "content": "The city of Hollywood, California, as the historical center of the American movie industry, has been a place of fantasies and fascinations since the first film producers decided to move there in 1913. Most of this almost supernatural mystique that has impregnated the city since those days was a direct result of the economic bonanza of the \"Roaring Twenties\" and the creation of the \"star system\", imposed by the major film studios in the early years Hollywood's Golden Age. The myths and legends of classic Hollywood would soon be exported to the world, and became an enormous influence for an Austrian young writer named Samuel \"Billy\" Wilder. Wilder would later move to America after the rise of the Nazi regime, and started a promising career at Hollywood, the very place of his dreams of youth. The opulence and decadence of the city inspired Wilder to write and direct a legendary movie in 1950: \"Sunset Boulevard\".\"Sunset Boulevard\" is the story of two persons, writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) and former silent-film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), whose lives will coincide on Sunset Blvd. and will never be the same again. As a scriptwriter, Gillis has not been lucky for a while, and finally finds himself hunted by two repossession agents who expect him to pay for his car. In his attempt to flee, Gillis hides his car in an apparently abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard. However, the mansion is not deserted, and inside he mets the owner, the legendary film star Norma Desmond, who has faded into obscurity after the arrival of sound movies. After she discovers Gillis is a writer, she offers to hire him so he can help her with a script she has been writing for her comeback to cinema. Gillis accepts, thinking it's an easy way to earn fast money, but soon he'll discover that nothing comes off that easily, specially on Sunset Blvd.While the movie is definitely Wilder's brainchild, the script was written with the help of his usual collaborator, Charles Brackett; and former film critic D.M. Marshman Jr., who was hired by Wilder and Brackett to help them develop the plot. The story follows the classic film noir pattern, but soon it is obvious that this movie goes beyond any genre conventions as it adds touches of horror, drama and black comedy in the most unmerciful critique to the decadence of Hollywood's Golden Age. The way the writers develop the characters is simply perfect in all its cynic realism, as while the characters are not without a touch of grotesque, they still look and feel so real that just enhance the horror and tragedy of this twisted tale about the dark side of Hollywood. Filled with fascinating characters, carefully placed details and a wonderful tale of madness, the script for \"Sunset Blvd.\" is definitely one of the finest ever written.As if writing a monumental screenplay wasn't enough, Wilder also excels as a director in this masterpiece, bringing his script to life in a haunting and beautiful way. Just like he did 6 years before with \"Double Indemnity\", once again Wilder reinvents the film noir genre thanks to the amazing cinematography by John F. Seitz, who captures the darkness of Norma Desmond's life with his heavily atmospheric film noir photography. His care for details and references to old Hollywood extend beyond his screenplay and populate the film in more than one way (the inspired use of cameos by real former silent-film stars for example), adding a great amount of authenticity and realism to the movie. Finally, the performances he managed to get from his main cast are simply some of the best done in an American movie.Many has already been said about the outstanding performance done by Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, but I can't help but commenting on the extraordinary level of perfection she achieved on her role. In her eerily autobiographical character (Desmond's past resembled Swanson's career in some ways), Swanson transforms herself in the vivid incarnation of the twisted mirror image of Hollywood's life, creating a larger than life character that gave her a much deserved praise. In his breakthrough role, William Holden makes an excellent subtle and witty counterpart to Swanson's over-the-top character, and despite facing extraordinary actors in this wild ride through Hollywood, he never disappoints and proves to be up to the challenge. Finally, legendary director Erich Von Stroheim appears as Norma's stoic butler, and adds a haunting aura of dignity to the movie with the powerful presence of his acting.Despite being a powerful criticism to the studio system and a brutal deconstruction of the Hollywood myths, \"Sunset Blvd.\" is also a fond love letter to the movies that resulted from it, and specially to the artists behind them (The cameos by director Cecil B. DeMille, Buster Keaton, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson are a testament of this); as while tragic and pathetic, there is a certain sweetness and humanity in the characters that makes this set of old Hollywood ghouls to be so charming despite their madness. While not without flaws (Nancy Olson's performance feels uninspired when compared to the rest of the cast), \"Sunset Blvd.\" is one of those movies that truly deserves its status as \"classic\", as thanks to Wilder's direction and the cast's performances, it reaches the closest a film can be to perfection.Time magazine described the film as the story of \"Hollywood at its worst told by Hollywood at its best\", and that's probably the best way to describe the haunting story of Norma Desmond in \"Sunset Blvd.\". Like the famous street that gives the movie its name, Billy Wilder's \"Sunset Blvd.\" has developed a powerful mystique around it, but that's just because in the course of its destruction of Hollywood's illusions, the movie made them even more real. 10/10",

No, it doesn't.Of course, I really liked actor William Holden as Joe Gillis, the out-of-work gigolo/screenwriter in SB. Sadly enough, in 10 years time Holden would become a chronic alcoholic, eventually killing himself in a drunken fall. Prior to that fateful moment, Holden was, without question, one of Hollywood's most attractive and likable male actors of the 40's and 50's. His presence here in SB can certainly attest to that appeal.But - On the other hand, I totally hated Actress Gloria Swanson, big time. I thought that she was a thoroughly despicable cow. (Moo. Moo.)Ironically, here was Swanson, the frickin' Hollywood has-been, playing just that on screen as Norma Desmond, the aging, Hollywood has-been. About the only diff between Swanson and her character was that Norma Desmond was a certifiable nut-case - While Swanson, herself, wouldn't reach that stage in her career for another 10 years when Alzheimer's finally sent her flying over the rainbow, for good.Back in her early twenties, Gloria Swanson, had once been the paid mistress of producer/politician, Joseph Kennedy. Joseph Kennedy was the father of sons, John and Robert, through his mousy, little wifey, Rose.Kennedy had actually financed a number of Gloria's starring vehicles early on in her career. With each one being a subsequent flop, one right after the other, this would eventually seal the inevitable fate of Kennedy's little, hush-hush affair with Swanson, who was an utterly awful actress, indeed, even back then.",

I am usually quite tough on people who just find some deep thought movies -such as Kubrick's- too distressing. With Sunset Blvd it's different: it's a Noir movie about Hollywood, Stardom, aging. In fact aging is the dominant theme here compared with the rest and it's a pity. Aging is a very serious and rich theme but it's more a philosophical one than a cinematographical one. Among the many movies about aging I saw each had a very interesting and creative viewpoint (I would recommend La Fin du Jour for instance) but they can't go higher than the down-to-earth tragedy of old people. Still Lives are for painters and no great painter ever devoted too many frames to Vanity. Perhaps when you're getting older, losing your hair -many years from now you'd say- those touching frames become a little more intimate with you.Sunset Blvd. aims to be a typical Noir movie: it was very much fashionable by then. The script is very well written this way but with the benefit of hindsight I found at least one thing is too much. The voice over from beyond the grave: just to think of what was previously planned (see trivia: the deleted morgue scene) makes me nostalgic about that all too thriving creativity Hollywood still had. All things considered I don't hold it to be a masterpiece since the aging theme -that is great Gloria Swanson- takes too much attention as compared with the noir hero. Poor script writer! Always at a loss for words in the industry of moving pictures!",

            "content": "Sunset Boulevard marks the most famous film noir and it's fitting that its Billy Wilder's. I for one prefer his early effort Double Indemnity but I think any fan of film should have an admiration for Wilder' here. I like what he does but not how he does it. Sunset Boulevard alludes the perfect rating from me. I can see why it is beloved and have a great admiration for it but I simply think it isn't the strongest film noir.Joe Gillis turns in his broken car into her driveway to hide it from creditors as he fights his writer's block. Silent Screen diva Norma thinks he is the undertaker providing him with a casket for her departed chimp. She offers him a job doing a rewrite of her dream project. He agrees to the job but he doesn't understand what the job really is.Norma's understanding of the job is that he will serve as her companion and lover. Joe thinks he will touch up her writing and that alone. Joe never expressly agrees to live with Norma, but soon becomes her prisoner. Max the servant and Norma overwhelm him by bringing his belongings to the house. He doesn't have enough gumption to refuse because he needs money and because Norma intrigues him.The classic mansion represents time standing still. It is an impressive house but it looks as if it hasn't been touched since Norma's era of stardom. It serves as Norma's shrine to herself full of pictures to herself. It acts as her place of solace from the real world which has long since forgotten her. Her butler Max encourages this and is the one responsible for Norma not coming out of her comfort zone.I think the fact that the Academy wasn't kind to the film could have been more to the sexual abnormality of the relationship but the film is highly critical of the social aspects of the industry. We do feel some pity for Norma because the idea of stardom has driven her to hell. The public ate her up and spit her out. It depicts Hollywood and its audience as fickle, loving a star but also loving to see that star fail. Only through murder is Norma able to get back into the spotlight. The character of Betty has to mutilate her face with a nose job to get that screen test which doesn't result in a job. The main criticism though is the fact that it portrays Norma as being anyone within the business. Joe remarks that he knew that many stars lived in the extravagant mansions . Norma's biography follows matches that of so many stars of yesteryear and today, multiple marriages,inability to accept criticism, living in extravagances, and yet all ways yearning for more rather than being content with the fame and fortune they have been given.The film noir elements within \"Sunset Boulevard\" are very obvious throughout the film to the point where they scream at you. The most striking is the relationship between the predatory femme fatale and the man who can't quite grasp the full scenario until it's too late. It was an easy choice for Billy Wilder to shoot the picture in black and white. The atmosphere of the picture simply wouldn't be as effective if it was shot in color. It is a film noir picture as well and you can't get the same shadowy and dark effect in color. I think as an audience member it captures the finest of the visual style of film noir particularly with the setting of Norma's mansion. I think it might have had more camp if it were filmed in Technicolor. Throughout the picture Gloria Swanson skates so close to being campy and over the top that it takes time to fully let the performance sink in and make an assessment of it. There were times I felt like laughing and there were times I was genuinely impressed by her ability. Shooting Norma in color I think would take away. She is all ways in lavish clothing and is said to look gaudy under layers of make-up and I just think Wilder and Swanson would get the wrong reaction in color. She is scarier in the black dresses and the make-up highlighting her wrinkles and I think she would appear campy if she had color, even darker colors in her face and wardrobe. Seeing her in color well just would make the character not as effective.Here is my main gripe with the picture, the ending/beginning, I think it drastically hinders the narrative. In \"Double Indemnity\" we have a viable reason for our character to be telling his story of murder , but how is it plausible for a dead man to tell a story? It just stretches the realm of believability too far. The shot of William Holden's floating corpse makes for a very powerful visual but it is over the top for him to talk from beyond the grave. Wilder took a leap of faith here and I didn't buy it. Another factor that makes this ending/beginning not work is the fact that it ruins the surprise. We all ready know the pinnacle of how mad Norma is. The picture becomes a matter of us waiting for her to reach her breaking point rather than having us wonder what that breaking point is. William Holden's character could have told the story before his final confrontation with Norma.In the famous ending the police convince Norma to come down by convincing her that production has finally begun on her dream project. Norma thinks the cameras are for her picture but they are just the newsreels out to exploit her at her lowest. We as the audience get a certain satisfaction in seeing her in this pathetic state. We really haven't changed much since Sunset Blvd., the only thing we love more than a star is to see the star crash and burn.",

            "content": "Introspection is good for the soul, at least some of the time: we all need to look at ourselves, from time to time, just to see where we're at. Unhappily, sometimes, we don't like what we see in ourselves \u0096 and maybe that's what Billy Wider was thinking of when he decided to make this movie, arguably one of the finest Hollywood movies about Hollywood ever made and still listed high in the Top Hundred Films.But, Billy Wilder and the cast didn't know that when shooting the film, nor did they know it would win three Academy Awards. But there's no doubt that Wilder knew that he was breaking new ground. According to Gloria Swanson, Wilder knew \"full well that such a script, about Hollywood's excesses and neuroses, was bound to give the Hollywood people acting in it healthy doubts, about the material or about themselves, depending on their individual security\" (1) Incidentally, Bill Holden wasn't the first choice to play Joe Gillis, the cynical script-writer: that part was supposed to go to a young Montgomery Clift, but he didn't like the idea of playing opposite a much older woman!In one of the most imaginative openings in cinema, the film begins with the dead Joe Gillis telling the story as he lay floating, face down, in the swimming pool at Norma Desmond's (Gloria Swanson) decrepit mansion on Sunset Boulevard; the camera angle from below, showing his gaping eyes and mouth, is unsurpassed to this day, in my opinion. How does Joe Gillis get there? Would you believe it all starts with his need to get a few hundred dollars to keep the skip-tracers away from his automobile, seeing as how Joe is way behind in his payments?Leaving them in a tangle of lies \u0096 something that Joe, we learn, is very good at \u0096 he accidentally finds himself in the grounds of a mansion owned by a silent-screen star, now living as a virtual recluse on Sunset Boulevard. Ever the opportunist, Joe finagles himself into a job \u0096 another thing that he desperately needs \u0096 conning the old bag into believing that he can rework her come-back script into the next Hollywood blockbuster, and all for five hundred dollars a week. In Hollywood, money can buy anything and everything, and Joe proved he was no slouch, pounding his typewriter to try and salvage something from Norma's overblown epic.But, after a few weeks of work, a funny thing happens on the way to see the director, in this case, the very famous and very real Cecil B. de Mille: Joe gets an attack of conscience, sort of, after finding out that the studio doesn't want her script \u0096 they just want to hire her old Isotta Fraschini open touring car with leopard-skin upholstery for some B movie! So Joe has to string her along, let her believe that her script just needs a bit more work and keep her happy. Well, the money's great and Norma just wants to keep buying presents for him, so why should Joe complain? Why indeed?But all good things come to an end, in the end. Just when Joe thinks he doing great on a new script that he's writing with his best friend's girl friend, Nancy Olson (Betty Schaeffer), Norma decides that she's fallen in love with Joe and won't let him go. That's big trouble for Joe, because he's fallen in love with Nancy and knows that he can't have either of them: Norma's just a meal ticket to him, and Nancy, well... she's his best friend's girl. And you never steal your best friend's girl, do you? Especially in Hollywood! Such irony...So, what does any heel do when up against the wall? Kiss the girls and run, of course. Only, he doesn't know where to crawl to, except away, maybe back to Ohio \u0096 his Hollywood dreams shattered \u0096 back to that lousy desk job at the local newspaper, and suffer the snickers and sneers from the creeps he thought he'd left forever...Anyway, Joe thinks he doing them both a favor as he packs his bags and tells Norma she's better off without him. Such chivalry! Only, he didn't realize, the schmuck, that there's nothing worse than a woman scorned \u0096 and one that has a gun. And it's pointed at his back, as he walks away, dejected, disheartened and disgusted, finally, with himself. Such is death, and for Joe, mercifully, it comes quickly as Norma shoots him down in crazed despair. Not for nothing is Hollywood called The Dream Factory.Ably supported by a bevy of real Hollywood players and producers, I still rate this as the definitive story about tinsel town and how it corrupts and destroys. Oh, it's been done again, sort of, with The Player (1992; directed by Robert Altman) and by David Lynch with his psychological masterpiece, Mulholland Drive (2001), but it all started with this one.You owe it to yourself to see it.

However, Gloria not only chews the scenery like an avid beaver, but like a whole colony of them. Erich Von Stroheim looks as though at any moment he will be joined by Dr. Frankenstein and Igor. William Holden (outstanding in so many roles, from \"The Moon is Blue\" and \"Stalag 17\" onward), and Nancy Olson, make June and Ward Cleaver, or the Bradys, look like deep, mysterious couples. But in spite of all of this, the movie is, as a whole, interesting and fascinating, not just when viewed as it would have been contemporaneously, but as a true relic of a film now over a half-century old.

Right at the beginning it leaves little doubt as to its tragic ending. And although the development of the action looks predictable there is not a single moment of dragging. The movie is about Norma Desmond, a heroine from the silent movie area who hasn't realized that she has been long forgotten by the audience. Now she wants to make a comeback with her own movie for which she has written the script. Joe Gillis incidentally runs into her and, since he is a script writer (and young and handsome), she chooses him to polish up her script.**MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD**There are some remarkably chilly moments: Joe Gillis witnessing the scene of Norma Desmond's monkey's funeral or - towards the end of the movie - Max' confession to Joe that he was Norma's first wife.Some of the movie's intensity may come from the fact that Norma Desmond is played by Gloria Swanson who was in fact a star from the old days of silent movies. Her butler Max is played by Erich von Stroheim who was director of many picture with Swanson before sound conquered the movies. Their performances give this film a lot of credibility.All the four lead characters received well deserved academy award nominations for their performances. Holden plays Gillis effectively in a cool and reserved manner which contrasts very well with Gloria Swanson. Von Stroheim is playing her butler Max and his devotedness to Norma is touching and makes the audience sympathetic both with him and his master.The movie ends with a memorable scene where Norma descends the stairs with all her grandezza after she has shot Gillis with a revolver. She doesn't realize that this would be her last appearance in front of a camera. Often when movies have a sad ending, they become corny. Not this one.

            "content": "The narrator, Joe Gillis, is the most well-rounded character and experiences the most change by the end of the film. He begins as a struggling writer trying his best to escape paying his debts, then capitalizes on Desmond's offer to live with her and supporting him financially and acts as her lover, then eventually repents from feeding lies to her to start anew with Betty, which leads to his eventual death, arching back to the film's opening. The stand-out character is that of Norma Desmond, a faded silent film star who is drowned within her own delusions and narcissism. She does not change much at all throughout the film's duration, but her levels of pride, manipulation, and insanity come to surface the more Joe Gillis, as well as the audience, gets to know her as a person. While maintaining a great fortune, she still seeks work in the film industry to gain none other than attention from fans and moviegoers alike. She does not seem so much interested in playing a good role as much as she obsesses for attention she once had. It isn't just global attention she desperately seeks for, but also romantic attention from Gillis. Desmond is a wreck, and as the movie progresses, the more her craziness shines through, eventually reaching a point of no return. When the film comes to a close, so does her sanity. The monster she truly is comes to surface clear as day when the film closes with her posing in front of the camera with a clawing hand and a wide open mouth like a roaring lion. The film approaches its 1950 LA setting with a darkly bleak tone as it features the realities of how Hollywood can affect its own people, most notably, Desmond and narcissistic and delusional characteristics. A large majority of the film takes place within the mansion of Norma Desmond, which seems to change to match the moods of the character. For example, the mansion first appears dark, messy, yet seemingly empty and abandoned, much like that of Desmond's persona. As the film progresses and she begins to believe she is make a \"return\" to the screen, the mansion becomes more cleaned and lightened, as Desmond believing her dreams are soon to come true. The set design itself is rather engaging as the crew behind the picture blended with the film's main direction and cinematography really brings viewers into the foreboding world the film portrays. The small attention to detail includes the up-close shot of an empty pool full of dirt while the expensive Hollywood locations certainly expand the scope. When the characters of focus feel small, they are often in smaller environments then the larger- than-life characters inside large sets. The pool and house of Desmond looks glamorous the end of the film, as does the studio of Paramount Pictures. One could also question what is taking place solely for the viewer and what takes place within the world of the film. An example of a transition from diegetic to non-diegetic elements includes that of the opening title \"SUNSET BLVD.\" stenciled on the curb of an L.A. street within the films world transitioned to the opening credits in the same font on the road, not within the film's reality. The film utilizes music, both diegetic and non-diegetic to convey subtle emotions of the characters. In one scene, Joe Gillis awakens from a dream stating he can still hear the organ song from the dream in his head, the audience hears this song transition briefly into non- diegetic score and then transition once more into diegetic piano playing by the character of Max. An example of music being excellently played, that can be questioned as to whether or not is diegetic, is the scene in which Joe Gillis quietly judges Desmond after her self- mutilation and contemplates his position with her, as the quiet music matches the feelings of the situation. The narration is arguably diegetic as the dead protagonist occasionally speaks directly to the audience using the word \"you\" such as in the closing narration. This narration throughout the film often contrasts the character's thoughts that are not being verbally expressed, such as his disdain towards the quality of Desmond's script. The film does not contain narration in every scene featuring Joe Gillis, but he is present in every scene leading up to his death with the odd exception of the scene in which Norma Desmond visits a studio and gains brief attention from fans. The narration aids in allowing the viewer to skip through time and back to tell the unique narrative structure. Before explaining the events that unfolded which led to his death, the character's body is shown floating lifelessly in a private pool. This beginning gives the audience something to anticipate and keep themselves guessing for throughout the run time. After hooking the viewer in with its opening, the narrative kicks off by establishing characters and leads into the inciting incident in which Joe Gillis hides his car at Desmond's mansion, agrees to work for her, and then move in. As the film progresses, he begins to feel disgusted by choosing that lifestyle, but makes the mistake of essentially becoming Desmond's lover. He breaks through this by sneaking out at night to write a script with Betty, which changes his arc, he begins to want nothing to do with Norma Desmond and threatens to leave which leads to the climax in which he is murdered. As Joe Gillis' character evolves, more is revealed about how strangely Norma and Max live and how delusional she truly is. There is foreshadowing throughout the film, including Norma's dead monkey hinting that Joe will be made a monkey out of himself, as well as the two main characters getting what they wanted, but not in the way that would be expected, for Joe, a pool, and for Norma, being in front of the cameras and becoming relevant once again.",

No character in All About Eve, though, is likable so it is difficult to keep with the film.  Sunset Boulevard, though, is full of tragic characters but they are also likable.  That is why it is superior.",

            "content": "Watching the film I felt a little bit like William Holden, a bit out of place but fascinated by the intrigue and insanity of it all. There can be no doubt that the movie is one of the best of all time, it's stars feed off each other in a macabre dance, best exemplified by the makeshift New Year's Eve Party. Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) spins an artful web for Joe Gillis (Holden), the spider and the fly in this case need each other in a symbiotic relationship that will ultimately lead to doom for both.The characters themselves almost seem larger than life, a particular line by Desmond confirms it. When Gillis first recognizes her as a former silent film star who used to be big, she replies - \"I am big, it's the pictures that got small\". That line lingers over the entire story the rest of the way, for a faded film queen with delusions of grandeur who can't recognize that her time is past. The card scene with Buster Keaton present adds further resonance to the masquerade, that was a great touch.Perhaps in a different way, Max von Mayerling's (Erich von Stroheim) story is just as compelling, the former husband turned butler who desperately trades loyalty for individuality. His time has also passed, but he manages to ride it out as nobly as he can. The finale when he takes over the direction of 'The Great Norma Desmond's' return is brilliantly conceived and movingly portrayed. Lights, camera, action, fade out - all smoke and mirrors where a fire once burned.It's interesting that \"Sunset Boulevard\" and \"All About Eve\" came out the same year, each casting a wary eye at their respective venues, Hollywood and Broadway. Following recent viewings of both, I would have awarded the Best Film Oscar to 'Sunset', a much darker film at heart with greater irony. Though not totally overlooked, the film failed to capture any of the 'big' awards, having to settle for recognition in writing, scoring and art direction. A thought came to me as I watched Holden's character packing his bags in an attempt to flee the madness. Can you picture the film a quarter century later with the benefit of an Eagles soundtrack - \"You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave\". Yes I know, it wouldn't have worked with the tone of the story, but the line fits. Oddly, this is so far the only movie I've seen with Gloria Swanson, and she was terrific. One couldn't imagine anyone else in the role, except perhaps Bette Davis, though she wouldn't have been in her fifties yet at the time of the picture. For his part, Holden displays just the right amount of angst in his role as the kept man, balancing an out of work career with the momentary hope of redemption that a successful screen play might bring. Both sizzle on screen, lending credibility to characters who can only arrive at disastrous outcomes, sort of long term contracts with no options.",

            "content": "It was okay.Gloria Swanson stole every scene she was in, and her expressive slightly overacting perfectly reflected her character, a performer from an age where vivid facial emotion was crucial in the absence of spoken dialogue. Eric von Stroheim plays an understated role and provides a strong, often silent presence. And William Holden is pretty, but not much else.Honestly, the only person who is remotely sympathetic or identifiable is Swanson's character of Norma Desmond, and the rest are fairly awful, aside from Stroheim's Max, who is basically very interesting scenery; I was pretty sad to reach the end and feel that everyone had basically come away with more or less just desserts. Holden's character was especially difficult to like and seemed to choose, at any given time, the worst and most idiotic possible choice of action.Was this Wilder's attempt at self-parody? Some parts of it would seem to be more satirical than serious, and the whole thing was entirely over the top. It could work as a Gothic tongue-in- cheek work, something like the Addams Family meets the silent age of film, which had aged past its prime.Perhaps it's just that the premise and the characters that populate it cannot really be seen the way they might have been in 1951. Desmond and Max's pathos and need for love and companionship juxtaposed with their isolation in a decaying yet still darkly splendid palace cannot fail to draw sympathy and interest. But Holden's Joe is just a stupid schmuck with a pretty face who never does anything right and was a poor choice for a protagonist.Ultimately it's hard to feel anything for him, though part of that may be the truly asinine choice to begin a film knowing your protagonist is...well, see for yourself. Or don't. It's good for a watch. I don't think I'll ever need to see it again.",

She is trying to write a script and \"hires\" him to ghost write it, keeping him a virtual prisoner... yet, she showers him with gifts. Is it love? \"Sunset Boulevard\" is considered a classic, a bit of romance, some noir, and a drama... it connects to the real world of Hollywood (director Cecil B. DeMille and Buster Keaton make appearances) and adds a seedy side. Not too seedy, mind you... but there is some joking about the lead being a \"Black Dahlia suspect\". That such a gruesome case gets referenced in a movie taking place on a Paramount lot is a bit risqu\u00e9, I think.The surprise star, aside from the obvious, is Milwaukee native Nancy Olson, who plays love interest Betty Schaefer (though whose love interest is a matter of dispute). She is quite beautiful, but never really became a big name (though she did make it into some notable Disney films).I suspect this film was an inspiration for Stephen King's \"Misery\" -- another writer held hostage story. King's has a bit more violence and torture, but the premise is similar. Take a dark plot and run it by King, it's bound to come out even darker... (\"Misery\" starred James Caan and Kathy Bates, who actually won a Best Actress Oscar for her part!) Take Billy Wilder's film noir masterpiece \"Double Indemnity\", lighten it up just a notch, make the plot more complex... and out comes \"Sunset Boulevard\".

What a treat it is as the movie certainly lives up to its billing as a classic.Though made in 1950 the movie is years ahead of its time as director Billy Wilder looks at the very dark side of Hollywood. William Holden plays a down at heel Hollywood scriptwriter who accidentally becomes first the script editor and later a lot more for a reclusive silent movie star, Norma Desmond, played by Gloria Swanson. Due to his dire financial straits he is unable to escape fro her clutches and, despite himself, he starts to tolerate the bizarre life he has made for himself. However a chance meeting with a young female scriptwriter reawakens his love of writing and makes him realise what he has become. However Desmond will not let him leave her life easily.The script was co-written by Wilder and is full of black humour and has some great lines. The voice-over by Holden is occasionally annoying, as it tends to say aloud what the viewer can see on screen anyway.The acting is brilliant. Holden and Swanson make a great couple, in a peculiar way. Swanson's silent movie acting style is perfect for the deluded character of Desmond. The final scene as she descends the staircase of her mansion to face the cameras is unforgettable. Holden is very good as the brash self-confident writer who has gone as low as he can go.There are appearances from great directors Erich Von Stroheim, as Desmond's faithful butler and Cecil B. De Mille, as himself. Von Stroheim is unexpectedly touching as the man who does the most to keep Desmonds fantasy alive.

What could be more realistic, pitiful, but superbly tragic than the butler writing phony fan letters to his faded star employer?  The fact that Sunset Boulevard was filmed in black and white I believe added to the power of the acting and the effectiveness of the narrative in the sense that it lent a grimy aspect to what was truly a dirty little story of personal failure. I also believe that because it was in black and white, I was never distracted by the scenery or the beauty of the sets and I was able to concentrate on the central aspects of the acting of William Holden and Gloria Swanson and the story they were portraying.

            "content": "I have always been a movie fan.  As a small child, I preferred a vintage movie over a cartoon any day.  At age 12, during a visit with my family to the famous \"Farmer's Market\" in Los Angeles, I found myself standing next to screen legend Gloria Swanson, and to her astonishment I not only knew who she was, but informed her that she was \"robbed\" when she was not given an Oscar for her performance in \"Sunset Boulevard.\" That was 34 years ago, and I still believe Gloria should have taken home the golden man.  Her brilliant performance has not been dimmed by the passage of time and the film is still an unchanged masterpiece. Brilliantly directed by Billy Wilder, who wrote the script with Charles Brackett, it was a side of Hollywood that was totally unseen before.  (The Hollywood of 1950 still believed their own publicity.)  But this story, so biting in its reality left many shocked and angry.  Wilder held the mirror up, and few were pleased with the reflection.  (Legend has it that MGM boss, Louis B. Mayer, stormed out of a screening and had to be subdued before he could punch the nose of very amused Billy Wilder.) I have seen the film countless times and never tire of seeing it again, so recently when I noticed that American Movie Classics was showing it one afternoon, I tuned in.  But this time, I made a promise to myself to keep my eyes off Gloria Swanson.  Her charactor of Norma Desmond so dominates the story that even when she is off screen, she is all you can think about.  So the film began and I watched everybody but her and was amazed that I saw the film in a totally different light. At first, I was extremely sympathetic to Joe Gillis, played by William Holden.  After all, he was struggling writer who just wanted his shot at success.  Circumstances, not by his choice, threw him into the world of Norma Desmond, a world where her star had shone bright above all the others, but dimmed, as he described, \"10,000 midnights ago.\"  It was here that my feelings for Joe changed for the first time.  As I said, the film is so dominated by the presence of Gloria Swanson that I had failed to see something that was very plain for all to see.  Joe Gillis, as played by Holden, was not a victim at all, he was the guy in the black hat.  He was the bad guy. The original choice of to play Joe was 29 year-old Montgomery Clift.  This casting would have validated the supposed age difference between Norma and Joe. Clift, who had been in a similar liaison in the early stages of his career with singer Libby Holman, got cold feet and backed out of the project.  Holden was the replacement for two reasons, he was under contract with Paramount and he was available.  So despite his initial reservations, William Holden accepted the role.  Gloria Swanson looked the same age as the 31 year-old Holden, a fact that did not go unnoticed by Gloria herself. Wilder had requested the make up department to age the youthful looking 49 year-old actress during pre-production test shots until a frustrated Swanson snapped back; \"Why don't you try and make him (Holden) look younger?\"Holden plays Joe with a hard edge, a self-loathing for everyone including himself.  He feels compelled to take from Norma, feel pity for her, but hate her nonetheless.  His preference for Betty Schaefer (played by 21 year-old Nancy Olson) now seems a mystery.  Why this plain Jane over the glamorous Norma? The ending of the film also changed for me.  Joe really murdered Norma, not the other way around.  He knew how unbalanced  she was, yet he pushed her over the edge with glee.  When Norma takes the gun and aims it at Joe, I found myself feeling that the bastard got his \"just deserts,\" and felt satisfaction when he plunged into the pool riddled with bullets. Billy Wilder's first draft of the this story was a comedy that he wrote with Mae West in mind.  This Norma Desmond did in fact return to Paramount and would make \"Salome\" as her \"return to the people out there in the dark,\" which was so \"over the top\" the public assumed it was a comedy, becoming a huge hit, making Norma a star all over again. (This concept was used seventeen years later by Mel Brooks in \"The Producers.\")  Apparently, Mae was not amused about playing a \"has-been,\" and Wilder re-wrote the treatment as a drama.  In a way, I'm sorry he changed the ending.  I would have loved to have seen Norma have the last laugh.",

These films are unimprovable as far as I'm concerned. Add \"Sunset Boulevard\" to that list.\"Boulevard\" represents Billy Wilder at his most acidic and ghoulish, but it's a testament to his genius as a film maker that he could create a film as relentlessly bleak and cynical as this one and make it devilishly entertaining (and even quite funny at times) rather than unbearably depressing.There's a big fat heart at the center of Wilder's bitter pill, and it's one that could be easily missed amid the dark, film-noirish exterior. I think that ultimately \"Sunset Boulevard\" is about the love of movies. You can tell that Wilder loves movies as much as the sad and decaying film star Norma Desmond, played brilliantly (and I don't toss that word around lightly) by Gloria Swanson. But he understands with an insider's point of view that there's a seedy underside to every business, and that's what he sets out to expose in his film. Movies get made and stars are born, but for every birth there's a death.I don't know how much of Swanson's performance is acting or her just being herself. If you allow yourself to think about it too long, Wilder's use of her is almost cruel, as making fun of Norma Desmond the character nearly amounts to making fun of Swanson the actress. The whole movie is uncomfortable in that same way--it's like a bunch of Hollywood used-to-be's got together and decided to let themselves be parodied for a greater cause. But the film stops just short of cruelty, because in many ways Norma is the most sympathetic character in the film, and every so often there's a glimpse of the vulnerable human being underneath that ridiculous getup that begs to be loved, and who can't relate to that? William Holden is perfect in a non-showy role that it would be tempting to pass off as an easy one. But I don't think it is an easy role. Holden has to be responsible for tempering the audience's reaction to Norma--he's the moral conscience of the film, and his steady presence anchors it and keeps it from sailing headlong into camp.There are so many quotable lines in this film, I don't know where to begin. Imagine this film and \"All About Eve\" coming out in the same year. It's a movie quote fan's wet dream.In an eerie bit of prophetic trivia, apparently Gloria Swanson thought this film would signal such a major comeback for her that she began plans to write a stage musical based on the film, starring herself. (She might even have gotten as far as completing it). Of course nothing ever came of it, and Swanson sunk quickly back into obscurity. But she would be vindicated to know that a stage musical did eventually appear, courtesy of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, and it actually does quite a bit of justice to Wilder's film.Grade: A+",

            "content": "Since I'm one of the biggest \"movie buffs\" and have written several screenplays already, I always enjoy the films that focus on the industry itself, covering the events that transpire behind the scenes. Surprisingly, I went into Sunset Blvd. blindly. I wasn't quite sure what the true premise of the film was nor was I aware of its genre. The film and title, of course, is especially famous- another timeless classic. So, as the picture commences with a character who's dying to make it \"big\" in Hollywood, I was already hooked right from the start. Suddenly, he's being chased by repossession men and desperately attempting to escape the eerie atmosphere of Norma Desmond's gigantic home. May I say just how substantially creepy I found Norma Desmond and the depressing, desolate environment she surrounded Joe with? From the hair-raising music to the sinister look on Norma's face all the way to the overall mystery of Joe's situation forced me to strongly grip the handles of my office chair, hoping Joe returns to the city, that's filled with excited and friendly faces, as soon as possible. Then again, with the setting comes the movie's presentation of this interesting juxtaposition between Norma's more optimistic perspective on her Hollywood career versus Joe's more sardonic and restrained outlook on the industry's patterns. So, knowing full well that Joe will eventually meet his demise near the pool- that foreshadowing scene near the beginning obviously locks in Joe's fate once the conclusion hits- created a much darker tone within the place he was staying but not exactly knowing how it'll occur whether it'll be done by the hands of Max (for an unknown reason), Norma Desmond, or the return of the repossession men. On the note of Joe's unfortunate death, I applaud Billy Wilder and his efforts to convince the studio in killing off the protagonist of the story. It was certainly rare during its time, and I'm sure Wilder went through great lengths in order to see it done as can be seen by the sheer dictator- like control these studios and producers have over the productions in Hollywood, ultimately limiting artistic freedom. It's also difficult to imagine how the film was able to paint such a cynical view of the movie industry, clearly portraying Paramount Studios in the process, without wide objection and protest. Essentially, in my opinion, that is exactly what makes a classic and its sustaining memory in moviegoers' minds for decades to come: a daring work of its time where we look back and wonder how the project was successfully finished whether it's concerning its technological/technical aspect, its subject matter, or the structure of its story. In that regard, Sunset Blvd. definitely amazed me, and in knowing I wasn't viewing a generic Hollywood movie that played along all the tropes and included all of the studio mandates, that edge of unpredictability was immediately inserted into my intense viewing. I have to question, though, the necessity of the sub-plot with Joe and Betty's romantically-developing relationship. Let's not also forget about that corny kiss (with the stereotypical love music in the background) before Joe made his permanent return to the mansion. That entire arc felt more like a studio mandate than anything for me, but otherwise, the story's whole progression and execution was unquestionably memorable and remarkable. In addition, the unexpected shift in Joe's personality and attitude towards the end felt slightly unnatural and odd. In a matter of minutes, he changed from a worried and charming fellow to a reserved and aggressive one. Anyways, it had its fair amount of twists and turns and entertained all the way until its finish. There could be much discussion about the film's treatment and view of the celebrity status and the terribly unfair standards that Hollywood persistently follows, but as Joe mentioned in an earlier scene, a motion picture doesn't always have to overwhelmingly and blatantly boast its themes. Sunset Blvd. will undoubtedly stick in my mind for years to come due to its absolutely frightening ambiance and fascinating storyline.",

Whenever she arches her eyebrows and her eyes get big and she starts to go crazy, her performance is so magnetic. She truly becomes her character.  It probably wasn't hard for her to do; she, after all, was a glamorous silent film star herself who had all but disappeared from the scene for years before this movie was made.  But her sharp delivery of the dialogue makes you believe every word she says.  That isn't to say that the rest of the film isn't good.  William Holden is very good, especially in those biting, darkly funny voice-overs.  Erich Von Stroheim is very eerie as the devoted butler Max.  (He was a silent-film director in real-life who made six-hour epics in the 20's, one of whcih actually starred Swanson.  He did not, however, discover her and never married her.)  The direction focuses heavily on the dark, fobodding, almost misty atmosphere of the whole thing, and the movie's all the better for it. But the best thing undoubtedly is Gloria Swanson's amazing performance as the greatest star of them all, Norma Desmond.\"I am a STAR!\"\"I am big; it's the PICTURES that got small!\"\"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my CLOSEUP!\"",

I've never really followed Holden's career and I've never seen Swanson before in a movie, but these two are phenomenal.Holden is a hack writer, Joe Gillis, who literally stumbles upon washed up actress Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) in her creepy mansion. They form a bond borne of both desperation and neediness. He needs money, she needs attention. Along the way, Joe meets Norma's butler/companion, Max, a fellow writer, Betty (Nancy Olson), and Joe's buddy, Artie (a pre-Dragnet Jack Webb).At first Joe sees this as a great way to get some money (his car is about to be repossessed). But as Norma slowly descends into madness, she starts pulling Joe with her. Ultimately, Norma completely loses her senses and Joe suffers for it. Holden and Swanson make the slow, painful descent completely believable. I'm sure there are other actors/actresses out there who could have pulled off these roles, but its hard to think of any. Holden is a smart aleck who makes jokes and writes dialogue with equal talent. Swanson is downright scary as the actress Hollywood wants to forget, but she refuses to let them off easy. She reminded me of that girlfriend who you break up with, but she refuses to accept it.I really loved the dialogue. Joe narrating the proceedings is an interesting quirk if you know the beginning of the movie (everything is told in flashbacks). The banter between the two is sometimes caring, sweet, and loving. Other times its harsh, angry and downright ugly. They both need each other, but being together is the worst thing for them.Hollywood has made some really great movies over the years. However, CGI, sex, and explosions have taken the place of great plots, dialogue and acting. Even though I was not born until 1966, I love these old movies. You just can't fake this kind of talent.",

Only hear make sure you know what I mean when I say Holden was robbed.  I'm not saying that Ferrer wasn't good in \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", I'm saying Holden was a lot better in \"Sunset boulevard\".  The reason I'm saying this is simply because throughout the movie, you think that there is no William Holden in the movie, that there was simply Joe Gillis playing himself through the whole movie and I'm not just talking about his acting, but his look and the voice-over especially, made you think that Joe Gillis made a movie about a part of his life.  Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a down-and-out script writer who owes everybody some money, especially his insurance company which has had enough of waiting for him to pay and threatens to take his car if he doesn't pay on that day.  Naturally, Joe doesn't pay and decides to leave town for a while to let things cool-off.  But as he is leaving, he runs into the men from the insurance company and so they run after Joe on a road that leads far out of town and luckily for Joe, as he is in a rather sharp turn, he hits a nail and drives his car directly into a lost driveway losing the boys from the insurance company.  Joe has no clue where he is.  In fact, he thinks he is in an abandoned house's driveway.  But as he approaches the garage, a man comes out of the main house claiming that \"Madame\" is expecting him.  Joe doesn't know what the man is talking about but enters the mansion as he is asked to and follows the man upstairs where he meets \"Madame\".  Now being a script writer, Joe recognizes \"Madame\".  She is in fact the star of the silent movies, the great Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson).  But Mrs. Desmond thinks that Joe is the undertaker who is there to bury her dead monkey.  Joe explains the misunderstanding and asks if he could just borrow a spare tire and he would be on his way.  But Mrs. Desmond refuses because she wants Joe to polish off the script she has written and that she wants to show to Cecil B. DeMille so he can direct it.  And so her servant Max (Erich Von Stroheim) shows Joe to his room and he begins to work as a gigolo for Mrs. Desmond.  Masterfully directed and acted, this is one film-noir you won't want to miss.  Personally, I felt that Holden and Wilder did a better job with \"Stalag 17\" but \"Sunset boulevard\" is still an American classic.  It was good to see Gloria Swanson back in action again.  She was very good looking in this movie and played her part very well.  But it is really the Holden-Wilder team that makes \"Sunset boulevard\" so good.  The movie leads to a great ending and the filming is excellent during the whole movie.  It's one of my favorite movies made by the great Billy Wilder and starring the exceptional William Holden.  This one you really don't want to miss.",

Unforgettable performances, effective visuals, faultless, inventive direction and a biting, comical and melodramatic screenplay make this a legendary film on filmdom.Joe Gills' (William Holden) corpse is seen floating in a swimming pool while his off-screen narration recalls his dangerous professional and personal involvement with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and the events leading to his demise. Joe, a B-movie screenwriter, inadvertently winds up at a decaying mansion, where faded silent film-star Norma takes residence with her faithful butler Max Von Mayerling (Erich Von Stroheim). The insane Norma has certainly past her prime but she mistakenly believes she can achieve a \"return\" as an actress again. Joe wishes to leave but when Norma insists that there will be serious cash involved, he takes on a job offered to him as an editor of her defective, self-indulgent screenplay. At first, Joe, who is now obliged to live with Norma, is treated like a gigolo, having every one of his needs catered. However, when Joe secretly co-writes a script with the attractive level-headed Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), Norma takes extreme measures to assure herself that she is a star who will not be abandoned.Wilder productively creates the eerie, dreamlike and surreal atmosphere in the beautiful black-and-white images of the crumbling mansion and the wicked, wraith-like characters. Nevertheless, not a single characteristic of the film seems fabricated or fictitious. Its sense of realism is undeniable. Many can relate to Desmond - rejected by Hollywood after years in front of the camera. Another unusual yet valuable aspect is its sense of humor and ability to laugh at itself. Even the most famous lines in the movie are both heartbreaking and amusing, intensifying the illusion that Norma has forever been a superstar.Gloria Swanson is exceptional in her magnum opus and most memorable role as the purely malevolent, manipulative Norma Desmond, a woman stuck in the past. Gloria, herself, was a silent movie queen of her time and had been missing from the silver screen for 16 years. Now, it is unimaginable to picture anyone else as Norma. Though less remarkable, William Holden is excellent as a skeptical screenwriter knowing Norma won't be able to attain the star-status she once had. He has moral flaws of anyone walking down the street but he slowly becomes the likable protagonist. Just as competent is Erich Von Stroheim who plays the silently sadistic butler, who guarantees Norma that she has always been the celebrity that she thinks she is. The final major character is ing\u00e9nue Betty Schaefer played by Nancy Olson. Her composure and calmness is a pleasing contrast to Norma's irrationality.SUNSET BLVD. is really a black comedy-satire with a sardonic, derisive screenplay, film-noir with perfect direction and character-driven drama with terrific acting all together. Though most significantly, it is a painfully captivating work of art and a candid peek on the fickle world of showbiz and its devastating effects.",

The viewers are then taken into flashback explaining the events that led to his death. The flashback takes the viewer into a roller-coaster ride into the insides of Hollywood and the sad condition of yesteryear's silent actors who have been long forgotten and live the life of a recluse.

Erich Stroheim as the Butler cum Yesteryear Director Cum First Husband of a Matin\u00e9e Idol lives his part. But Gloria Swanson takes the cake as far as the performance is concerned. Her portrayal as a yesteryear silent movie super-star who fans have forgotten makes us feel for her. Her struggle to convince herself that she is still (At 50) the biggest superstar around with millions of fans wanting her to comeback leads her to live the life of a recluse which finally makes her mentally unstable.

            "content": "William Holden is Joe Gillis, a down and out screenwriter trying to keep his car from being repossessed in \"Sunset Boulevard,\" a 1950 film written and directed by Billy Wilder. The film stars Gloria Swanson, Max von Stroheim, Nancy Olson, Jack Webb, and Cecil B. Demille. Gillis hides his car in a garage, not realizing it is the home of the great silent film star, the delusional Norma Desmond (Swanson), who lives in this enormous mansion, cared for by her butler (von Stroheim). Finding out he is a screenwriter, Norma solicits his help in editing her script of \"Salome,\" her comeback film. Feeling somewhat trapped at first, Joe eventually enjoys the good life. When he slips away to be with his friends on New Year's Eve, his friend's fianc\u00e9e, Betty Schaefer (Olson) suggests a screenplay based on a story written by Joe. (The story actually was a script by Wilder, filmed in Germany.) He returns to the Sunset Boulevard mansion to learn that Norma, distraught over his leaving, has attempted suicide. Taking pity on her, Joe becomes her lover and moves from the garage into the big house. Meanwhile, he's falling for Betty and slipping away to work with her at night.This is perhaps the greatest Hollywood story, and yet it didn't get off to a very good start. The first scene took place in a morgue, where the dead bodies talked to one another. At the first screening, the audience laughed, which they weren't supposed to be doing. As Wilder sat on the steps outside, a woman walked out and, unaware of who he was, said, \"Have you ever seen such ?x@//*&?\" \"And we had worked on it for a year,\" Wilder told an interviewer. So the opening was cut.Wilder captures the ego and delusional aspects of Desmond perfectly, a woman caught in the past who has lost all sense of reality. This role provided silent film star Gloria Swanson with her great comeback. With her royal demeanor, sharp voice and gorgeous eyes, Swanson actually plays the role like a silent star, in a very overt way. The truth is, Norma never left not only her stardom, but her film roles. At the time of the filming, Swanson was 52 playing a has-been of 50. By today's standards, it's somewhat amusing, and you'd probably add 20 years if you were doing it today. In fact, in the Broadway show, the line \"There's nothing wrong with being 50\" was cut. Wilder approached Mae West, Pola Negri and Mary Pickford for Norma before Swanson.\"Sunset Boulevard\" may have given Swanson her comeback, but it made William Holden a superstar. After his starring role in \"Golden Boy,\" Holden disappeared into light films and basically went nowhere until Joe Gillis. He is remembered today as one of the great stars of the '50s, yet he was of the same generation as many of the stars of the '30s and '40s. He is glorious looking - you wouldn't have to be a loony tune to lock him up in your house. He plays the role with the right touch of cynicism and self-hatred. Montgomery Clift was set to play this role but dropped out. He, too, would have been excellent but probably not as hard-hitting. von Stroheim, as Norma's protector and butler Max, is perfection. In real life, he couldn't drive, so the car needed to be towed; in the scene where he drives up to Paramount, he actually crashed through the gates.In the film, Norma, thinking that Demille wants her for a role, goes to Paramount and visits him on the set of \"Samson and Delilah,\" and \"Sunset Boulevard\" uses the real filming of that movie and its cast.As a Broadway show, \"Sunset Boulevard\" was opulent but much less effective. There wasn't enough music (the second act had one new song) but provided a tremendous showcase and two great numbers for the various women who played Norma. Stephen Sondheim had at one time entertained doing this as a musical; in his hands, it would have captured the dark atmosphere of the film much better.Billy Wilder gives us a biting portrait of actors who live for nothing but their stardom, their hangers-on for whom they are just a meal ticket, and the sadness of being aged and forgotten in Hollywood. A great classic starring the greats, written and directed by one. It doesn't get any better than this.",

One of Wilder's other classics- Double Indemnity- may be the definitive film noir in terms of being the most 'film noir' of all of them and defining the genre, but Sunset Boulevard is probably the best overall film of the genre.So for all the praise, I did acknowledge that there were some things that dated the film, and yeah, I gave it 9/10 instead of a 10/10. The flaws, however, are minimal, and honestly it's quite unfair to point them out because they may only be true flaws when watched today. For example, the soundtrack can be overblown and overly dramatic at points (really, this was pointed out by someone I watched this with, and I hated to admit it but she was sort of right), but back then, maybe this music didn't sound that way. And I don't mind it too much- it adds to the melodrama this movie does dip its toes into, and complements the larger than life character of Norma Desmond in many regards (we'll get to her more specifically later). In fact, everything with Norma Desmond is so great that when the film spends sometime with the protagonist getting to know another woman by the name of Betty, the film becomes slightly less interesting. Not in a way that kills the pacing, or makes me as a viewer disengage; it's just worth nothing. Thankfully, the character does eventually have an important reason to be in the story, and contributes well to the memorable climax, so again: it's really more of a nitpick.Now that all that pettiness is out of the way, time to recap the good stuff. There's a lot of it, so I'll probably miss something, but it's such a beloved movie that going over what makes it so good is perhaps going to feel somewhat redundant anyway. I love how meta this film is, especially for its time, and to my knowledge it's one of the first Hollywood movies to really be about movies and the industry that churns out films while also churning heartlessly through human beings. It's one of the overall best movies about movies I've ever seen. It's dark and subversive while also being at times morbidly funny, and must have been incredibly shocking and potentially even overwhelming for audiences at the time.The lead performances are all fantastic too. Swanson is absolutely amazing, delivering an over-the-top, very passionate 'silent move' performance but with dialogue, which creates something of an uncanny, mesmerising effect. She went all out and showed an often frightening level of commitment to the role; her character is tragic, sympathetic, hilarious, scary, and bewildering all at once. It's almost a shame for Holden and Von Stroheim that she's so good, because their performances are fantastic too, just not quite as showy. It's fascinating how similar Von Stroheim's character is sometimes to Desmond, in a far quieter way, while Holden does a great job as the film's protagonist, as well as offering up one of my favourite voiceover narration's in film history. Then there is the fantastic and brutally thought-provoking script, the typically great direction from Wilder, and the absolutely amazing set design and lighting. Norma Desmond's decrepit yet lavish mansion is one of the most memorable film locations in history, so much so that it almost feels like a shame when the cameras leave it to show things happening elsewhere. There is so much thought and effort put into how this movie looks and where it's all set, and it contributes to the story and overall mood so very well.Sunset Boulevard is close to perfection, and is a film I doubt I'll ever tire from revisiting every few years or so. It has a lot to say, and a surprising amount of it remains interesting and relevant. Additionally, it has an absolutely amazing and haunting ending, and an almost equally impressive opening scene for that matter. It's worth watching at any cost, even if you're not usually a fan of older films, as in my opinion, this is one of the best that came out of Hollywood's famed Golden Age.",

Let me just say I wish I had watched it sooner. This has to rank as one of the greatest films ever made. EVERYTHING is perfect. The dialog, the direction, and the actors. Joe Gillis (The amazing William Holden) is a down on his luck Hollywood screenwriter, about to give up his dreams of glory to move back home, when he stumbles upon the mansion of long 'retired' screen legend Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) while eluding some collection me who've come to repossess his car. A star from another time, Desmond desperately awaits the return of the limelight which has passed over her many years before. As Gillis meets her, she is a recluse in a decaying Hollywood mansion \"The type of place crazy Hollywood people built in the crazy 20's\" Her only companion her butler Max, and a recently deceased chimpanzee. After meeting Norma, Gillis is offered the chance to rewrite a script that Norma believes will be her big comeback. Seeing an opportunity to make some easy money from an obviously delusional (and very rich) woman he takes the job, but before long he is ensnared in his own prison, a kept man in every sense of the word. The script by Billy Wilder is not to be missed. The dialog is so sharp, and full of great lines that have been quoted for the last 60 years you will be amazed. The film is also chock full of symbolism, and clever plays that a second viewing is definitely in order. Highly recommended!",

Joe Gillis, a down on his luck screenwriter, happens upon the one-time Hollywood Gem Norma Desmond who sees Gillis as a way to relaunch her flagging film-career.

It is pathetic seeing Norma Desmond, sitting in the dark watching her old films, but it is also poignant and sad too. She was once a massive Hollywood star, but now everybody has even forgotten that she existed. To be launched into fame and then to have this fame taken away from you would be difficult to deal with for anyone let alone a has-been actress like Norma Desmond.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/GpaqvS",

And it's definitely not a Film Noir.If anything, Sunset is a satire on Hollywood BY Hollywood with its built-in gripes not very universal: a lot like another Hollywood satire (considered a classic as well) decades later, also starring William Holden.

You feel there is a chance he and Nancy Olsen's character will be able to get away from her and live their lives in peace together but the story is a tragedy so there has to be some disappointments. Norma (Swanson) refuses to let Joe (Holden) go but he still persists and she kills him. The audience tends to pity Norma for losing her career in the movies and for desperately trying to hold on to it (she surrounds herself with old publicity pictures of herself for comfort) even though it's dead and has no chance of redemption. After killing Holden, she practically becomes oblivious to the deed and suffocates herself into believing, \"I am the greatest star there ever was\". It is a great American classic.

            "content": "So sings the Joe Gillis character in the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical version of this classic Billy Wilder film where every twisting turn of the boulevard and Norma Desmond's mind is felt banging in the viewer's stomach. William Holden is a starving writer who doesn't want to return the rented car and finds a twisting turn on his own destiny as he hides inside the mysteriously overgrown driveway off the twisted Bel Air area of the Los Angeles suburbs in order to hide from the men after him. He's in for more than he bargained for when he rings the doorbell of the dilapidated estate (shades of Grey Gardens) and finds a funeral for a chimpanzee going on. If the sight of dour butler Erich Von Stroheim isn't enough to get him to turn around and rush out of there, the sun-glassed older lady who mistakes him for an undertaker should be. But Gillis, an obvious expert in Hollywood History 101, instantly recognizes her. She's Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a silent movie star whose career ended years before, lost in memories of Valentino and Chaplin, and certainly not in tuned with 1950 Hollywood.As Joe will find out, you can't mess around with the emotions or ego of a Hollywood legend, even if she hasn't made a film in 20 years, because actors were commodities trained by the studios to make grand entrances at premieres and be oh-so-perfect, larger than life and like Kleenex, disposable when they are no longer needed. Today's headlines prove this still to be true as stars rise and fall with amazing speed even if they have less than 1 percent of the veteran star's magnetism.This movie was a sensation in 1950, not only because of Swanson's return to films after almost a 10 year absence, but because of its stark observation about how Hollywood cast out their former money makers just because they weren't as popular anymore. Studio heads were furious, but veteran actresses recognized the truth in it and praised Swanson for her guts. Even though the film got nominated for a ton of Oscars (including four of its actors) and is considered one of the greatest movies ever made, let alone greatest movie ever made on the madness of Hollywood, it took only one major award (writing) and two technical awards.Ripe for parody, drag queen impressions and rip-offs which had little in common quality wise with the original, this did make a very good, if not excellent musical, where such divas like Patti LuPone, Glenn Close, Betty Buckley, Elaine Page, Diahann Carroll and Leslie Uggams assumed Norma's turban. But in the annals of film history, there is only one Norma Desmond, and that is Gloria Swanson, who proved that she was not making a come-back here, simply a \"return\".",

It was ahead of it's time in 1950 and, in 2013, cannot be redone without failing. There was much hullabaloo about who would play Norma Desmond. And, although she may have not been the first choice, Gloria Swanson nailed it in the role of a lifetime. The role of any actress' lifetime. Miss Swanson's performance touches the border of being campy and too over the top. But, in just touching the border and never crossing it, she left behind not only one of the greatest performances by an American actress, on film, but one of the most indelible film characters of all time. They remade Psycho and it failed. This film should never be remade. The only actress that could possibly fill Miss Swanson's shoes is Meryl Streep. And, she is too fine and smart an actress to attempt it. It is an impossible role to recreate. This movie has provided us with so many memorable lines & scenes.

One of the first movies to really skewer the business end of Hollywood, this film was not popular with the studios or with the \"rank and file\" in the business.  It was nominated for Best Picture but lost to All About Eve, which played on similar themes but with a Broadway setting (safer for a movie to criticise!).  The performances are all first rate, especially the leads but also the innocent script-reader, played by ... well, I've forgotten her name.  Nancy Olsen?  Something wholesome lime that.  She was excellent, and this film, if popular, should have made her a Star, but since I can't recall her name, it's somewhat obvious it didn't.Even the supporting cast was great -- C.B. DeMille, as himself, brought a truth to his role, and great sympathy for Norma Desmond, the forgotten diva, probably based on his real-life working relationship with Gloria Swanson, who did indeed do some of her finest work with him, in his pre-Biblical-spectacular days.Any who haven't seen this film HAVE TO, NOW!  It's entertaining, suspenseful (even though you know Holden's fate from the first minutes), funny, eerie, and wonderful.  The exteriors used for Desmond's mansion have fallen just into the right stage of decay ... the pool looks unkempt and decrepit (even though it was built specifically for the film!) ... the huge 1926 limosine, though gorgeous, is perfectly cast as the kind of limo -- with the leopard skin seats and flower vases -- that Norma Desmond *would* have bought in 1926, when $28,000 was at least ten times harder to earn than it is today.Highly recommended.

Basically set in the 1950's Hollywood, movie screenplay writer Joe C. Gillis (Oscar nominated William Holden) narrates the story going to flashback that leads up to the murder seen at the beginning. Joe is struggling to get his work sold to any studios and has debts, and one night he ends up with his car getting a flat tyre and at the mansion of a former silent movie star on Sunset Boulevard. Norma Desmond (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Gloria Swanson) lives alone with butler and driver Max Von Mayerling (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Erich Von Stroheim), and has been doing so for many years since losing her popularity, becoming deluded and demented since, believing that one day she could return to the industry. Max being her ex-husband and former director who still has feelings for her is very protective of Norma, but she wants Joe to move in to the mansion to write a new screenplay for her to make her comeback, and in the process her becomes her lover and gigolo. Even though he is getting paid for doing this, he slowly starts feeling trapped, and seeking friendship he leaves one night to see Artie Green (Jack Webb), and he bumps into studio reader Betty Schaefer (Oscar nominated Nancy Olson). They quickly become attracted to each other, but Joe still returns Norma feeling some very warped sense of loyalty to the old actress, of course he still meets up with Betty to help her with her own script idea. By the time it seems the couple have fallen in love, Norma finds out and feels extremely jealous, she tries to sabotage whatever they have together. In the end Joe makes the hasty decision to threaten to leave the mansion, and that is when Norma really loses her mind and shoots him dead, so he has been narrating from beyond the grave, and with the press showing up about the murder her demented mind of fantasy thinks that she has made her longed after comeback.

This movie is about a silent-screen star, Norma Desmond, who lives in a mansion with her butter. Living in her own world, Norma cannot come to the term with the fact that she is not famous anymore. Her butter, who used to be her husband and director in the years of her reputation, also helps her to be in the illusion that she is still a famous actress by showing her photos that are asked to be signed by her. The stage of being self-absorbed and losing touch with reality is to the extent that even after being charged by the police because of murdering her beloved screenwriter, she still sees everything the way she likes as she makes a speech in front of the police about how happy she is to be in a film again, ending with \"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up\"",

Let's face it, folks, this is the kind of claptrap that made the revolution in film-making some 20 years later so necessary, films like \"The French Connection\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" sweeping away the cobwebs of crass melodramas like \"Sunset Boulevard\" and never looking back.

I don't know if that says more about the film or myself. The only flaw of the film was the totally obvious relationship development between the main character, Joe Gillis (William Holden), and Betty Schafer (Nancy Olson).\"Sunset Boulevard\" takes place in none other than Los Angeles (hence the name). The movie begins with an anonymous man, dead, floating in the pool of an L. A. palatial estate. That was the ending we'd get the backstory to. Providing our backstory was Joe Gillis, a struggling script writer from Ohio who'd come to Tinseltown to make it big. He was holed up in his one bedroom apartment banging out one script after another in hopes he could make something worthy of selling. He was behind on rent, behind on his car payments, and one failed script away from the next bus back to Dayton.While trying to evade the repo men he wound up on the property of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an older actress whose best days were behind her. When he met her she mistook him for the man who was there to bury her pet chimp. That should give you an idea of how eccentric she was. She lived in an enormous, gaudy mansion with only her butler as company. It was garishly decked out with mostly photos of herself. As Joe tried to sheepishly leave Norma's home due to the mistaken identity it came out that he was a writer. This tidbit interested Norma because she had a script she wanted to have made into a movie. It seemed this was a fortuitous break for both Norma and Joe--she wanted her script professionally typed and movie-ready while Joe needed money in the worst way. So the two were paired together.It wasn't long before Joe realized that he was more than just a simple ghostwriter for Norma. She essentially claimed him, and what Norma wants Norma gets.This movie was brought to life by Gloria Swanson. She was spectacular. She was nominated for an Oscar for her role, and if I had a say she would've won it. I cannot overstate how wonderful she was. She played the delusional older actress role so grandly and so expertly that you'd think that was her true personality. The character Norma Desmond was always on stage whether she had an audience of none or many, whether they were close friends or strangers, she had to put on. I already believe that the acting in the 40's and 50's was exaggerated anyway, but she was so exaggerated in her behavior, mannerisms, and speech that it created the perfect effect.She and the movie reminded so much of a childhood favorite of mine: \"Mommie Dearest\" starring Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford. The two movies are a little different, yet so similar and I loved \"Mommie Dearest.\" Until now, that movie was the standard for the aged actress refusing to admit her career is over. \"Sunset Blvd.\" has supplanted \"Mommie Dearest\" and, I believe, set the bar so high that no other movie should even attempt to reach it.I'll even go one step further. This movie about Hollywood and the film industry is the best such movie I've ever seen. That's a list that includes \"The Player,\" \"State and Main,\" \"S1m0ne,\" \"Hollywood Shuffle,\" and others.",

            "content": "Exactly in the middle of the 20th century, Gloria Swanson delivered one of the best performances in film history. I have seen this movie countless times, but I can always find something new to admire. Watching it as an old person is very different from watching it young when I thought Swanson's portrayal of Norma Desmond was camp; now it seems like pure pathos. The style of the film is noir, melodramatic and eerily gothic, but Swanson's best scenes are not only the classic descending the staircase or snapping \"I am big; it's the pictures that got small.\" The scene in which she begs Joe (William Holden) to love her is heartbreaking. I used to feel a bit sorry for Joe, bamboozled as he was into her trap; not so now. Holden's character is a liar and an absolute cad. Even when he seems to genuinely care for her after the suicide attempt, he is really caring only for himself. When the movie was released in 1950 the idea of a woman of 50--who we are told has been washed up for the previous 20 years, which means she must have been through at 30-- falling for a man half her age must have been shocking. But it really does tell the story of how Hollywood treated its great leading ladies. No such revulsion for the male matinee idols who regularly played love scenes with girls half their age. In Sunset Boulevard, we are told in so many scenes that Joe was practically nauseated by the idea of making love to her, but he is such a user that he continues to feed her delusions. It is also interesting to note that we are never shown a sexual scene, certainly not one of those deep kisses that Humphrey Bogart and Gary Cooper regularly planted on actresses who should have been playing their daughters. Is Sunset Boulevard over the top? You bet, way over, and I cannot get enough of it.",

However he doesn't help things here and to me he is just too boring of an actor to be of interest. Kind of like Joel McCrea or Van Johnson. Add to that the narration. It's funny at times, nicely cynical as well. But there's too much of it. The movie is over-narrated and by a guy who is dead. Wilder doesn't allow the scenes to breath.

            "content": "SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950) is a film that I discovered in my youth that has always stuck with me. And it's just as powerful, emotional, and memorable over 70 years after it came out in theaters. THE ultimate scathing indictment and essay on the cold, ruthless nature of Hollywood. The film was nominated for 11 Oscars, won 3, and should have won more, but especially Gloria Swanson, who was nominated Best Actress, should have won. This is probably one of the top 10 performances in history that didn't win an Oscar. And her competition wasn't exactly shabby as she was up against dual All About Eve threats Bette Davis and Anne Baxter, as well as Eleanor Parker for Caged, and the actual winner Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday. The popular take it should have come down to Swanson and Davis, but that Baxter took votes that might have gone to both of those ladies, so that Holliday managed to steal the award due to the split voting. No matter, Swanson is the one who should have won the gold. Her performance is by far one of the most fascinating and unforgettable in film history.Sunset Boulevard tells the tale of struggling Hollywood writer Joe Gillis (played superbly by Best Actor nominee William Holden) who is in heavy debt and being chased by collectors one evening when he manages to escape them and hide his car in the garage of what he thinks is an abandoned mansion. Turns out, the mansion belongs to Norma Desmond (Swanson), an aging silent film star who has all been but forgotten by \"modern\" Hollywood. The talkies have taken over and so Norma is outdated. When Joe tells Norma that he's a writer, she enlists his help in touching up a script she's been writing and Joe uses this as an opportunity for free room and board. Norma also has a very loyal servant named Max (brilliantly played by Best Supporting Actor nominee Erich von Stroheim who was also a silent film director in real life). Rounding out the quartet of acting nominees is Nancy Olson, who was nominated Best Supporting Actress for her role as Betty Schaefer, a young girl who is a struggling writer that falls in love with Joe.The flawless script is loaded with endless sarcasm and dark humor. The movie also has a very Gothic horror element to it as Norma's huge, empty mansion is creepy and cold. The 4 main performances are great. Swanson is gloriously over the top, playing Norma as if the world is her eternal stage. Holden is exceptional as Joe, who is actually the film's protagonist with the most screen time and one could claim the plot revolves as much around his character's struggle to break free of Norma's hold as it does on Norma's descent into madness. Von Stroheim is menacing and stone-faced as the creepy Max, who is happy to accommodate Norma's delusions of grandeur. And Olson is very good as the pure and innocent young girl blissfully ignorant to Joe's impossible situation.The great Billy Wilder directed this all time classic and was nominated Best Director and should have won. No question this film deserved Best Picture. Ironically, it lost to All About Eve, another biting film about the ruthlessness in the entertainment industry. As great a All About Eve is, it is second place in 1950 to Sunset Boulevard as far as I'm concerned. At least Sunset Boulevard is a film with a ton of Oscar nods that is deserving, unlike most films in history. To this day, no other film has captured the tragic underbelly of Hollywood when fame is fleeting and big stars become has beens. A biting, sarcastic, thrilling, tense masterpiece of a movie.",

Erich Von Strohiem appears as Swanson's butler who was a silent film director (as the actor was in real life).

            "content": "Sunset Boulevard is a 1950 film about Joe Gillis (William Holden), an unsuccessful screenwriter, and his time with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), an old silent film star who is still completely obsessed with herself. The film begins in a peculiar way. It is narrated by the character of Joe Gillis and starts off by showing his body in a pool, we know he dies from the start. This is actually my only flaw with the entire film, although it is very minor. I thought it would have made for an interesting twist if we didn't know, but I could be wrong and the fact that we know the entire time may have helped the film rather than hindered it. Gloria Swanson is the true star of this film. As William Holden's character has no real money left, he eventually stumbles upon Norma Desmond's home. He stays with her for the duration of the film as she gradually delves into disillusionments, self-obsession, shallowness, and pure insanity about her previous film career.This film is truly a strong character study. Quite possibly the best around. We really get into the psychology of Gloria Swanson's character and her performance does an unbelievable job of portraying it. Right from the start, we can tell something is off. She is clearly obsessed with herself but at first, it just seems like a typical stuck-up film star who only cares about herself. It gives the perception of being normal at first glance. But, as the film proceeds, we realize she isn't normal. She will go to any lengths to proceed with her disillusionment as much as possible, she wants her glory days back, not realizing she never will. Max (Erich von Stroheim) is Norma Desmond's butler and only helps with her disillusionment. He keeps it up and allows it to happen. We don't know why until towards the end, but it makes sense as it reaches the point. Joe Gillis stays with Norma to fix a script she wrote. He knows it's horrible, but he has a comfortable place to stay and basically infinite amounts of money. He's satisfied. We don't really get extremely in depth with his character, but I'm okay with that. It needed to stay focused on Norma as it did. The movie is masterfully directed by Billy Wilder, as he usually does. John F. Seitz provides the film's cinematography that gives it the distinct film noir look. I don't have a whole lot more to say about this film but it truly is a masterpiece filled with multiple haunting and memorable moments.",

            "content": "Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a Hollywood writer struggling to find work and pay off his debts. He unintentionally ends up parking in the driveway of a dilapidated mansion owned by Norman Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a mostly forgotten movie star of the silent era. Joe has writing skills and lacks money; Norma has loads of money but needs a writer to help her with a screenplay that she intends for her comeback. So the arrangement is made: Joe becomes a working resident as Norma falls in love with him.In addition to Joe and Norma, two other characters in smaller roles have major impact. Firstly, there is Max von Mayerling (Erich von Stroheim), Norma's dedicated (one could say pathologically dedicated) butler who has other past associations with Norma. Secondly, there is Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), a studio screenplay analyst with writing aspirations of her own including a collaboration with Joe.Joe's mindset lands somewhere between the opposite extremes of Norma and Betty. Norma fully believes in the illusion of Hollywood success and happiness. On the other hand, Betty is very clear and grounded about where she stands within the Hollywood system and she's found contentment with her lot - all this at the age of twenty-two. Joe begins to think less like Norma and more like Betty about his own situation before other events take a serious turn.One of the many praises of \"Sunset Boulevard\" is its parallel to real life especially with the choice of players who, in many cases, play themselves. Swanson, like Desmond, was a great silent screen star who failed to make the transition to talkies (this is difficult to believe considering her great work in this film). During a scene involving a bridge game, Norma's guests are Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson, and H. B. Warner, all former silent screen stars whose fame went to oblivion like that of Desmond/Swanson. And one of the best scenes involves Cecil B DeMille who also plays himself as a director working at a Paramount studio as Norma visits him. It is one of the warmest scenes in the film as DeMille shows paternal kindness to Desmond even if he's being somewhat deceptive - unable to tell her the truth about the film she wants to make. It's also one of the rare moments Norma feels at ease, surrounded by praise and attention - even if some of it is insincere.Director/co-writer Billy Wilder gets so much out of his fine cast. As the main character, Holden draws sympathy as someone acting unethically but whose situation is so desperate, he is easy to understand; as an extremely enabling co-dependent, von Stroheim's Max might be laughable at times but he shows genuine sadness when the collective illusion starts being exposed. His action in the final scene is shocking even if it is genuinely in character; as the story's anchor, Olson manages to bring a sweet charm to the smartest character who can see through all the Hollywood illusions; but Swanson truly stands out in a role who can easily draw laughter, contempt, pity, and sympathy sometimes even simultaneously as a super-egomaniac.It is that final scene that is gripping all the way through and well after the film concludes. In the hands of many other actresses, the scene could have ended up as laughable camp and placed the film in the category of \"so bad, it's good\". But in Swanson's hands, the scene and film end up in the opposite extreme. Her portrayal of insanity is so powerful that it leaves the viewer speechless as it also shatters the belief that Hollywood fame is the ultimate source of happiness. This archetype (a has-been star who still thinks she's famous) was also superbly played twelve years later by Bette Davis in \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane\".RATING: 10 out of 10OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:Directing by Billy WilderScreenplay by Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder, and D.

An absolute A, one of the best films ever made, with an excellent performance by Holden and Von Stroheim.On a cold winter day, staring out of the window, I often think about this masterpiece, and wonder if Swanson plays a role or plays herself.",

Sure, any screenwriter has been drowned in the swimming pool of the villa of a star, shot to death, but the plot of the movie, it's a true story. Gloria Swanson was really an actress forgotten by cinema, Erich Von Stroheim a German director, not famous anymore and Buster Keaton and the other \"ghosts\" were really living in those conditions. Billy Wilder wanted to watch the dark side of Hollywood, the underwood of those forgotten, who won't surrender to their destiny. It has been very brave and if you think that he's the same author of \"Some Like It Hot\", you can only consider him as a genius. Rating: 10 out of 10.",

In her mind she is a true star, but Hollywood looks at her as a thing of the past. William Holden offers another great performance as the struggling screenwriter who shows up in Norma's life at the wrong time and ends up with much more than he bargained for.

            "content": "Sunset Boulevard is universally acclaimed. It is one of those films which should you dare suggest it is not among the greatest films ever made people think you're an idiot. Well, at the risk of being labeled an idiot, Sunset Boulevard is not among the greatest films ever made. It is a good film, certainly captivating in its own unique, macabre way. But is a film for which reputation outstrips reality.Most everyone is familiar with the story of Sunset Boulevard, that of faded silent film star Norma Desmond. The faded star lives in an equally faded mansion, plotting a comeback which is far-fetched to say the least. Failing screenwriter Joe Gillis stumbles into Norma's bizarre world and, at the price of his dignity, feeds her delusions. A man's gotta make a living and Joe will make his by brushing up the godawful script Norma has written as her comeback vehicle. Joe will soon realize Norma wants him as more than a script doctor. He is to be her lover, a kept man living in her grotesque mansion, surrounded by the relics of Norma's past, reminders of a life which for her is gone forever. Of course in her deluded mind Norma is just as big a star as she ever was. It's the pictures that got small.Gloria Swanson turns in a performance for the ages. Her portrayal of Norma does match the hype, even if the film as a whole may not. The descent into madness is breathtaking to watch. Yes, Swanson is a little over-the-top at times but that is who Norma is. Especially as Norma begins to lose all touch with reality. William Holden, playing Joe, is not bad but certainly not up to the level of Swanson. Joe is a bit of a dry character, he could use some more personality. Holden doesn't make him into as much of a presence as he really needs to be for the film to truly grab you. Erich von Stroheim, playing Norma's ever-faithful butler Max, does have a presence, a quite ominous one. But as we learn more about the character Max becomes less ominous and more sad. It's a sad world Norma Desmond lives in and that sadness grabs everyone who falls under her sway. Joe knows he has to escape. He tries to find happiness with beautiful young Betty Schaefer, with whom he secretly works on a script. But nobody escapes Norma Desmond easily.All in all Sunset Boulevard tells a very sad tale, centered around the quite pitiable Norma Desmond. Norma longs for a world which is forever gone. She won't accept it and nobody will try to make her do so. Max, her only companion before Joe shows up, allows Norma to live in her fantasy world. She retreats so far into her fantasy there is no way back to reality. Norma cannot be saved. She has lost her mind. And despite the fact she does some truly loathsome things you can't help but feel sorry for her. For you saw those moments where the old Norma Desmond shined through, where you could see her for the great star she once was. But those moments are fleeting and ultimately those moments are gone. Only a sad, pathetic shell of Norma Desmond remains. It's a sad journey the character takes, a journey Swanson captures ever so well. You just wish the rest of the film was up to Swanson's standard. Holden can't quite match her. Nancy Olson brings a desperately needed breath of fresh air to the film in playing Betty but the romance between Betty and Joe never fully sparks to life. von Stroheim is memorable in his own way but his character is ultimately almost as sad as Norma. So much sadness in this film. Sunset Boulevard has a captivating story to tell but in the end maybe there is a little too much sadness. And madness. By the end it veers dangerously close to parody. There is much to appreciate about the film but to label it as one of the greatest films ever is to give it more praise than it deserves. It is a good film to be sure. But perhaps upon close examination Sunset Boulevard is not quite ready for its closeup.",

Her performance is quite amazing, with that accent that reminds me of Cruella de Vil when she says \"Anita, daaahrling...\" in 101 Dalmats. So much glamour, so delicate moves, all mixed up with terrible psychological distress, craziness, spotlights overdose.

I'm convinced that the trick to getting the most out of SUNSET BLVD, is not to let it be the first classic movie that you watch. After recently viewing the restored edition on DVD, I realized how much more I understood about this film than I did the first time I'd seen it many years ago. It wasn't because I'd seen it before. It was because I'd seen many early and silent films since. It's within the context of early cinema that SUNSET BLVD really takes on a horrific and realistic tone. Even the casting reflects this, although it's best if I don't comment on that for those who haven't viewed the movie yet. And if you haven't, by all means wait. Watch some major silent films if you can find them. Then watch some early classics from the '30s and '40s. I'm not saying you can't watch SUNSET and think it's great all by itself. But you're really missing much of the bite of the film, I believe, in not getting a bit of an early cinema education beforehand. Once you 'get it', this one really stays with you.

Financial opportunity opens up, but at the same time personal dignity, a writing career, and more purist romantic opportunities begin to recede. And the workings of the Hollywood machine are laid bare in the process.If Sunset Boulevard were merely an expose of Hollywood machinations, it would occupy a niche nestling next to entertaining, but ultimately navel-gazing celluloid output such as The Player or Bowfinger. The fact that the film is an all-time classic tells you it resonates with universal themes, of identity, fulfillment, ambition, and love and all its compromises. William Holden is the cynic/dreamer writer Joe Gillis, self-assured in his contempt for Dayton, Ohio, but racked with self-doubt about his status in Hollywood. That ambivalence makes him easy prey for Norma, a veteran at 50 of an industry that has moved on without her on board. 'Eccentric' is an adjective reserved for the wealthy who are insane, and it is money, and the adulation of servant-with-a-secret Max, that keeps Norma from the gates of the Funny Farm.Gloria Swanson as Norma is electrifying; terrifying and pitiful, and utterly compelling. The excesses of the performance, seen in isolation, suggest an actress aiming at camp, but synthesized into the overall narrative are a portrait of a bipolar personality veering towards total self-annihilation. The younger lover, like her own movies that she screens constantly, allow her the illusion that time has not ravaged her life. It is an illusion her own ambitious craving for more screen time will destroy. Holden quite simply oozes cynicism and compromise. Erich von Stroheim, as Max, gives a performance of single-mindedness, his own devotion to Norma outstripping even her own egotistical self-delusions. Even Cecil B. DeMille manages to play himself straight, resisting the urge to wink at the audience, so that cameo does not come into it.Wilder directs boldly, setting his stall out from the off with a layered vision of a dead man in a pool, staring into the void, prodded at by police officers and photographers. An awareness of the interconnectivity between the cast, crew, characters and contemporary Hollywood history certainly adds spice to the viewing experience. However, Sunset Boulevard is an epic even when encountered purely in terms of the narrative contained within its 118 minutes running time. Cinematic storytelling at its finest.",

The only thing I was disappointed with Sunset Boulevard, is I wish it was in full color. Other then that, THIS MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC!!It was really a gutsy move to make this back at that time, with Hollywood trying to hang on to all the glamor and glitz (behind their mask), because I do not believe that Swanson's character, Norma Desmond, only represented one woman. I believe her character was symbolic of sooooooo many actors and actresses (but mainly actresses, because of the main value placed with actresses are youth and beauty. An aging male actor is still more marketable then a middle aged actress.) There seems to be certain professions that draw certain types of people. Acting seems to draw an ENORMOUS amount of hyper-insecure, overly dramatic, and overly sensitive people - those that just thrive on gaining attention from others. The insecurity very quickly becomes egomania, snobbishness, and false pride when they gain a bit of fame, and then they become professional victims who claim childhood abuse or other when they don't get their way, or when the public knows they've done something very wrong. To show certain aspects of this in a movie made back then is TRULY GUTSY!! KUDOS!! It made way for other like movies to come about, like, \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\", \"Play Misty For Me\", \"Fatal Attraction\" (Where the emotionally disturbed woman was played by Glenn Close, who later played Norma Desmond in the Broadway version of Sunset Blvd.), and so many others.I would highly recommend seeing this flick.

The only major hang up to be found is an issue of presentation which, to me at least, doesn't do too much to tarnish the film.The acting is great across the board, with the standout of course being Gloria Swanson. Somewhat overshadowed by her is William Holden in the lead who, despite Gloria's powerful presence, gives a very watchable and nuanced performance. His role is one which is easily related to by the viewer and acts as a perfect catalyst for the feelings of the audience. The decisions made and the actions taken by Joe seem very true to life for just about anyone and the bridge that the character creates between the absurdness of the story and the audience is invaluable. Gloria Swanson does a spectacular job acting completely insane. Hers is a performance equally as invaluable as Holden's and is equally as layered. Given that the story is centered around her it is only appropriate that Norma Desmond's character is the most fascinating and is made more engrossing as the film progresses as the unraveling story of her past adds more and more depth.The rest of the actors do very well with Erich Von Stroheim providing a performance nearly as engrossing as Gloria Swanson's. The movie is impressively shot and the story well written/acted. The only issue I found was the narration by Holden as Joe. The remarks that he makes often seem redundant and the visuals within the film are frequently sufficient in getting the message across. That is not to say that the narration is entirely damaging, as it effectively expresses thoughts which the main character often cannot voice given the context of the story. A little less may have served the presentation though.Overall, a great film and entirely enjoyable to watch.",

Not understanding what happened, Joe sees a dead chimpanzee and a woman upstairs. Joe says there is a misunderstanding, and the woman learns that he is a screenwriter. Norma Desmond, the former silent movie star, offers her money to help her with the script. Joe agrees to pay off his debts, and the woman has the butler prepare the room above the garage for him to stay. When he wakes up, he sees that his belongings have been brought from his house, and even though he gets angry, the woman convinces him. The butler Max is actually her first husband, and the melancholic woman sends fan letters home to feel good, and at the same time the man is the director who made her famous. Joe leaves home when the woman gets close to him on Christmas night and goes to his friend's party. They decide to work on one of their scenarios with his friend's wife. Norma cut her wrists when she left. Joe treats him well and sneaks out of the house at night, writing a script with the woman. They then go to Paramount studios to see the director for whom he sent the script. People are nice to the woman, but the director didn't like the script and the reason they called her butler is to use the woman's old car in a movie. Upon jealousy, he calls Betty and upon hearing this, Joe tells Betty to come to the mansion on the phone and tells the woman everything. After sending the woman, the man leaves the gifts and packs her belongings. Seeing this, Norma shoots the man at the exit and the man falls into the pool and dies. When the cameras and the police arrived, the woman completely lost her mind. She thinks the cameras have come for the movie and she starts acting. Max is sad that he could not protect the woman in the dream world he created.",

            "content": "Perhaps the best film ever made, 'Sunset Blvd' follows the story of lonely and struggling writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) who is thrown into a web of romance and feuds with aging silent actress Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her creepy butler Max Von Mayerling (Erich Von Stroheim) when he accidentally stumbles across Norma's mansion when he uses her garage for his car so it doesn't get taken. Norma will do anything for him, and she also truly believes she is still famous even though people barely remember her and she can make a comeback to Hollywood. But Joe knows all to better and wants to escape her odd, aging and treacherous ways. He meets Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) and begins writing a script with her-and perhaps even falling in love. This sets off Norma who will stop at nothing to be in the limelight, get Joe and make pictures again...even if it means murder. An intelligent look at Hollywood with amazing performances and one of the best scripts. The use of the black and white color makes a grim and eerie look of the film, which helps pull the viewer in. A fascinating thing about the film is that while the story is fictional it somewhat holds true to Gloria Swanson, even at one point viewing a film of hers that ruined her career! A truly haunting and memorable look at the desperate and true side of Hollywood. 10/10",

A co-dependency ensues between Gillis and Desmond, but Desmond didn't bank on Gillis falling in love with Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olsen) an aspiring screen writer who threatens to interfere with the relationship that has been established between Gillis and Desmond....Billy Wilder is an odd sort of director to me, because out of the films of his that I've seen it seems fairly evident that he can do 'COMEDY ONLY' well i.e 'SOME LIKE IT HOT'. He can also do drama only well i.e 'ACE IN THE HOLE.' However, the meld is when he falls into trouble - think 'THE APARTMENT.' But SUNSET BOULEVARD is definitely an example of an excellent drama like 'ACE IN THE HOLE' ...It's hard to know where to start with this wonderful film, but I think initially we need to start with Holden and Swanson; Holden gives a nice, ill-at-ease quirky performance, although the cynic in me couldn't understand why Bogart wasn't cast in the role? He would have been perfect. This isn't helped by Holden's performance which felt very Bogart-lite. OK so the film is also creepy and kooky, mysterious and spooky, but it's not the Addams family... Having said that I felt that Holden underplayed wonderfully allowing Swanson to shine whom it has to be said was truly exceptional.I must admit though that I liked Max - he's Norma's butler, but there's something very Bondseque about him; I couldn't make my mind up whether he was a poor and stunted relation to Lurch from the Addams Family or a Bond villain's henchman from the 1960's or 1970's - answers on a postcard for this one please....I've joked about the above and yes at times it is hard to take some of this seriously - it is a tad theatrical and cheesy at times, but when it comes to its critique on Hollywood it is practically spot-on and for true cinema buffs this is an absolute must watch.",

One of her zany characters was based on Norma Desmond, and she even showed a clip from this movie to explain where the character came from.  Gloria Swanson came on the show as a guest and praised Carol's performance.  And no wonder. Swanson herself was only slightly less outlandish!  This movie may not have been considered a comedy, but Norma Desmond was certainly a funny character, when she wasn't being pathetic.  Carol played the character for laughs, of course, but it's easy to see why this, one of her favorites, was a great movie to spoof.  Max was a straight character here, but on Carol's show Harvey Korman lampooned the director-turned-servant to the washed-up has-been-star.  And this character was just calling out to be spoofed, now that I've seen him.  I don't really see what was that great about this movie, but Swanson was wonderful, even when she played the Desmond character straight. You have to feel sorry for a woman who was once a star and can't bear to live life without the limelight--Max even wrote fake fan letters.  Erich von Stroheim also came across very well, even though he wasn't funny. Cecil B. DeMille was a pretty good actor, even though he just played himself.  William Holden did a good job also.  I kept hoping his character would learn to stay out of trouble, but he just couldn't seem to get a break.",

This scene is actually the end of the movie. Then the movie starts from the beginning and shows you how the body got there. The film starts off fast with a great car chasing scene. There great sound effects off tire's screeching around turns and eventually one of the tires even pops. The main character Joe soon arrives at a mysterious,creepy,and what seems to be abandon Maison. This mansion gives the perfect creepy vibe to the movie. Right away there's a very scary shot of Norma looking down at him through an upstairs window, a very classic shot to warn the audience something just not right with the house. The inside of the house is even creepier with tons of weird directions and organ music playing in the background. One of my favorite parts of the film is when Norma is standing in front of the projector light and it looks as though smoke is coming off her head really signaling to the audience of her evil mysterious ways.Norma's character overall is great she did a very wonderful Job of play the crazy old actress from Hollywood with priceless facial expressions. I think without her strong acting it definitely would not have been such a good film. I didn't enjoy how Joe and the younger Women fell for each other so fast and didn't really understand the scene where they looked like they were going to make out in the bathroom of her boyfriends party. It was very awkward and strange, as well as the rest of the film but I just didn't think it made sense to put in. Overall its a good film and would recommend it.",

It was nominated for 11 Oscars, including Best Actor and Actress for Lead and Supporting Roles, Best Cinematography. It took home the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Music and Best Writing. The film starred William Holden as Joseph \"Joe\" Gillis and Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond. Gillis is a washed-up screenwriter and Desmond is a washed-up actress who wants to make a Hollywood comeback. The film opens with a very dark scene and storyline of Gillis ending up face down in the pool. Gillis gives a voice over narrative saying he will explain, and we transfer to six months early at the beginning of this story. In the quest to find/have a script to come back to the Hollywood glamour and never aging brings about greed and tragedy. Norma Desmond cannot accept the fact that she is not young anymore, and that she is no longer a star.The film was dark and shadowy. The lighting through the film was dramatic, sometimes catching a silhouette of the characters. The opening scene of a dead Joe Gillis laying face down in the water, but the shot was from the bottom of the pool, looking up to see the police standing over the pool was eerie. The scene was created by placing mirrors at the bottom of the pool and filming from above the pool. Swanson's performance of an aged- washed up actress was great. In many of the shots and scenes, she is shown trying to portray a younger, in style actress, but in reality, she is someone who no longer has what it takes to succeed in Hollywood.",

            "content": "\"There's nothing else. Just us, and the cameras, and those wonderful people out there in the dark. All right, Mr. De Mille, I'm ready for my closeup.\"\nThese are the painful words from aging actress Norma Desmond as she grapples with fame right after she committed a murder. This phrase is one of the most memorable phrases in cinema's history. Billy Wilder has a knack of making such endings in his movies as evidenced by Some Like It Hot. Sunset Blvd. Is one of the best movies about Hollywood. It tackles a very relevant topic as it deals with fame and what happens when fame run its course. The movie is every bit of a film-noir as it is a comedy. Just like Wilder did with Double Indemnity, he created a movie that thrills at nearly every turn and the relationship between William Holden and Gloria Swanson keeps coming and grabbing you until the shocking ending. You can also classify the movie as a black comedy. Personally, I did not have any belly rolls but rather uncomfortable giggles which is by design. The pet monkey funeral sequence is just an example of one that illicit such giggles. Regardless of the genre, the movie is about as good as it can be. It is a surefire classic and one that cements Billy Wilder's as cinema's most impressive director.Billy Wilder had an eye on a story like this for quite some time. Living in Berlin in the 1920's, Wilder was always fascinated by American culture that was depicted through moving images. He had interest in the star system and the luxurious homes that came with this star system. Two decades later, living in Hollywood, he would think about these homes and ponder what became of the Greta Garbos or the Mary Pickfords of the silent era as many of these stars struggled to continue their careers with the advent of sound and dialogue. People tried to guess, but no one really knew who Wilder based Norma Desmond on. It is likely a composite of different actresses. Of course, with Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stronheim being important figures of the era, we see a little bit of themselves. A movie von Stroheim directed with Swanson as the lead is screened for Holden's character. In fact, Wilder made it a point to use authenticity. Cecil B. DeMille played himself. Former silent stars such as Buster Keaton make an appearance. Hollywood's influence is everywhere. It is an age-old theme that is even relevant today as we always see stars who lost their luster years ago try to make a comeback. Wilder's and Charlie Brackett's screenplay is highly intelligent and uses several genres to make a story about characters, young and old, trying to make their way through the unforgiving valleys of Hollywood.Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a struggling B-writer who is having problems financially. His car is on the verge of being possessed by creditors. While trying to avoid them, he stumbles upon a mansion of former Hollywood, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). Norma lives with her servant, Max (Erich von Stronheim). His job is to satisfy her ego and make her believe she is still loved by the public. Joe takes this opportunity to create a screenplay for Norma's comeback but does not realize what Gloria has in store for him. As he becomes seduced by her wealth, it might be too late to realize just how far he needs to go to satisfy his needs and Norma's needs.Gloria Swanson, a product of the silent era, was one of the few who made peace that her film career ended and went into radio/television. She was superbly intrigued when Wilder approached her with the script. Because of her healthcare routine, she looked really good for her age. I am glad she took the role because she is fantastic. She is a nutcase, but you understand where she is coming from. I am sure I would feel it if I lost my fame because of changing times. Acting opposite from Swanson's star performance is the younger William Holden. Eager for roles since coming home from the war, Holden made every scene count. As he was drawn into the luxurious lifestyle of Norma's, so were the viewers. Erich von Stronheim, originally a director, is mysterious and more than just the personal valet. He is pivotal in the story and when we find out who he really is, the reveal works. Also, Nancy Olson is good as the girl who falls in love with Holden as she wants to start a career in Hollywood herself.Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, Sunset Blvd is one of the best movies if not the best movie Hollywood has made about itself. Paramount did not really know what Wilder was making as he started shooting without a finished screenplay and worked the screenplay a little bit at a time. The idea about an aging actress in Hollywood is very similar to another 1950 classic, All About Eve. Both are similar, yet different in their own ways. Of course, they both need to be seen. This is the film-noir version of the 1950 Best Picture Oscar winner. It is thrilling, has some unpredictable twists, and is an important character study about fame and how it can affect people. One of the best endings the movie has!My Grade: A+",

            "content": "'Sunset Blvd.' is widely regarded as the first movie which took a no-holds-barred look at Hollywood itself, and the unflattering side of movie-making. Gloria Swanson, 53, a real silent film star, plays Norma Desmond, a silent film star who used to be 'big' and was now just an almost insane shadow of her former self. Swanson had been in 67 movies before Sunset Blvd., and was in fact near the end of her career. Five years before his role in 'Picnic', William Holden, 32, plays Joe Collins, a 'B'-grade scriptwriter that can't get scripts accepted anymore, and is three months behind in both his rent and his car payments. That these two characters' lives would become intimately tangled resulted from one random event, the car tire's blowout. There is little fiction here, aside from the characters' names. The real studio is featured, as are the great director, CB DeMille, and silent stars like Buster Keaton playing bridge with Norma and others. As a pseudo film-noir, it is shot in B&W, which works for this story. The DVD has a great-looking picture, with several worthwhile extras.  A good movie.SPOILERS follow, for my own recollection, quit reading, OK??The movie opens with Joe floating, dead, face-down in a pool, but still able to narrate. Six months earlier, Joe was running from the guys out to repossess his car when the tire blew out. He turned into a driveway and into the garage of an apparently empty and dilapidated mansion. He is invited in, thinking he was the man to embalm and bury the dead pet Chimp. Soon he finds out that a middle-aged lady and her somber butler live there, then surprised to find it was Norma Desmond, who was writing a script for DeMille for her to star in a movie. The script was bad, but Joe needed money so agreed to work for $500 weekly to help her rewrite the script. Not wanting her script to leave, she required him to stay in the room above the garage, and the next morning he awoke to find all his belongings from his apartment now in this room!  Plus, Norma had his back rent paid. He became a kept man, showered with new clothes and other gifts, although he knew the script would never be made into a movie. A roof leak over the garage forced him into the main residence and, when Norma dressed him up for an elaborate New Year party, and he found out no other guests were invited, he fully realized her intentions towards him. Angry he left, she slit her wrists, he came back, began working nights on a real script with a young lady, Betty, fiancee of his friend Artie (Jack Webb), who was out of town on a shoot, Joe and Betty appeared to be falling in love, Joe not wanting to wrong his friend, brushed Betty off, headed with his suitcase back to Ohio, Norma shot him, three times, he fell into the pool, when newsreel staff arrived, Max her butler said 'The cameras have arrived', she walked out to them as the movie ended.",

            "content": "My husband had never seen Sunset Boulevard, so we watched it together. The great thing about this film is that it's like watching living history. Southern California, in all its glory, in 1950, before it was overrun by cars and freeways and people. When it was a beautiful sunny state filled with orange groves and people with dreams.It's fantastic to view the film just on this level. But of course, there's so much more to it.Aging silent movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) end up crossing paths in a way that is highly, highly unlikely.But once they do, Sunset Boulevard becomes a fairly riveting story about fame, money and the price people pay to keep it or be near it.William Holden is so beautiful that all he has to do is just stand and look at us. I found his acting to be fairly wooden, but on occasion he tapped into a few emotional states of mind and indicated that he might have some talents. But his main talent was a fantastic profile, an incredibly hot haircut, and a good, strong voice. That was enough.Gloria Swanson looked amazing for what was considered \"old\" at the time (about 50). There are scenes in which she is getting her skin treated, and there are magnifying glasses exposing her face and while a filter may have been used, she still had stunningly beautiful skin. I kept thinking: in this day and age she'd never be out of work. She would have embraced social media and people would have never forgotten who she was.But for the purpose of the movie, as great silent film star Norma Desmond, she lives in the past, where she was \"big.\" There are a lot of great quotable lines from this screenplay and Gloria gets most of them, including, \"I still am 'big,'; it's the pictures that got small.\"The cast is rounded out with Nancy Olson as Betty Schaefer (a reader for a movie studio) and Erich von Stroheim as Max (Norma's chauffeur, butler, and former husband -- before which he had discovered her).Nancy had that sort of wholesome Wisconsin girl goodness about her. She was not super talented, but she did a good job in the small role she was given. I'm sure she didn't realize she was going to become part of movie history. Erich spoke English clearly, but with a very slight accent that made it clear that he was not a native speaker. He is stiff throughout, but that is the role he was supposed to play. His dedication to Norma is sad, but it's clear he still loves and worships her.One of the things I found odd about this movie is that Jack Webb (of \"Dragnet\" fame) plays Artie Green, who does something in the movie business (production? It wasn't clear to me), and who, unless I'm mistaken, has a hard crush on William Holden. He calls Joe \"beautiful\" and touches his face and clearly wants to be near him. And who wouldn't want to be? In that day and age, Bill Holden was a god. I just found it be a unique moment in the 2-3 scenes where Jack and Bill are together. I feel like Billy Wilder told Jack in private, \"You have a crush on him\" and Jack said, \"I DO have a crush on him\" -- and that's how he played it.The film fails in that Joe cannot see a way out for himself, which doesn't make any sense. In other words, he shows up penniless and desperate at Norma's house, and she clothes him and feeds him and gives him basically anything he wants, but in return she expects a slavish devotion to her which is insane. But he lets it happen. Basically he's a kept man, and that's what was interesting about this movie. Who was making movies about \"kept men\"? No one.But at any point, Joe could have said, \"Norma, it's time for me to go.\" But it isn't until Betty confesses her love for him and indicates that maybe the two of them could have a future together as writers that it dawns on him that maybe it's time to pack up and get out.Norma, who is sick with obsession, won't tolerate this, and this is what leads to the movie's sad denouement.Yes, it is of its time. No, it is not perfect. Yes, it is still watchable. Yes, it is over the top. Yes, there are still some great moments. So, all things said, if you are a movie fan, and know your movie history, \"Sunset Boulevard\" is a must-see.",

I did find it very hard to deal with Gloria Swanson even though she played a magnificent role and casting her was perfect for the role she had. You could tell she was a silence film actress because you could see how she used expressions and looks to portray just how she was feeling or dealing with things. This is what made it very hard for me to deal with this women. I felt the director did appropriate job of selecting a cast that met the demands of the movie including Nancy Olsen who plays the woman who gets William Holdens mojo for writing back. The score and dark ominous lighting did a amazing job of portraying just how dark a road William holden's character was moving down the line and just how far and extreme it might get to escape it. This is why the beginning scene which happens to be the last scene sets off a great example of what can happen in life if you just accept things and let people start to run your life. Wiliam Holden knew there was no escaping the dark, scary tones of what Gloria Swanson's life had become because without her he truly had nothing. Overall, this movie was brilliant and strange while keeping you on the edge of your seat to see what will happen to \"Joe Gillis\" next.",

This was the first film that I have seen where the Mis-en-scene was really breath taking. It was the first film where a movie used real names in Hollywood at the time. Wilder showed that the set was at Paramount Pictures. Wilder showed how movies were started and made. Also, this was the first movie of that time where i noticed other references to movies in the film. First film I have seen relevant to todays time period. Great lighting throughout the film. The settings looked expensive. Yet again, I have seen this house before in other films. They use the same houses to film quite often. Gloria Swanson was a great, intense actress. I really felt her character during the whole movie. I loved how she went insane at the end over her fame and not being what she once was. She really pulled this character off and made it believable.

She lives alone in an old big house and she is assisted by a loyal man who serves and takes care of her. One day, a young writers gets there by chance and he gets involved with the old lady. That`s when the movie really begins. These two people discuss their points of view, talk about their experiences and make us feel good watching it all. I can`t tell much of the film, cause it talks by itself. I just have to say Billy Wilder is brilliant! He shows again he was one of the best directors ever! I also have to say people should have more respect for the ones who came first. Old people still must be heard and respected, cause they will always have something to say and to teach us.My grade 10/10",

As luck would have it, however, while trying to elude some men attempting to repossess his automobile a flat tire causes him to drive into what he thinks is an abandoned mansion on Sunset Boulevard. Once there he is met by an elderly man named \"Max Von Mayerling\" (Erich von Stroheim) who motions for him to come into the house as the owner wishes to see immediately. It's then that he meets a former silent movie actress by the name of \"Norma Desmond\" (Gloria Swanson) who mistakes him for a funeral director called upon to bury a pet. Once the error is corrected she informs him that she has a script for a movie she has been working on and would like his professional opinion on it as she is planning on returning to the movie business to reclaim her former glory. Although he accepts her eventual offer of employment what Joe doesn't tell her is that the film industry has long since evolved and she simply doesn't have the talent necessary for such a return. What Joe doesn't understand is the danger associated with her mental and emotional instability during this particular time. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an entertaining drama which benefited from good performances by all involved. I especially like the haunting ending which Gloria Swanson delivered with such eerie precision and I recommend it for those interested in a film of this type. Above average.",

Narrated by William Holden who is sheltered at her mansion in return for a screenplay that will resurrect her. Intriguing setup rich in dialogue and plot turns that result in the ultimate revelation in the conclusion. Billy Wilder does an excellent job at presenting ill fate Hollywood careers due to technology. Wilder previously made an entirely different film called Double Indemnity and both share a common theme of dominating femme figure. Swanson delivers a riveting performance of a woman illusion to total madness. Holden feels his talent trapped and seeks escape through an outside project. Erich von Stroheim is the ex-husband who lives to revive her past. He will be instrumental in assisting her concluding performance and famous last words. Nancy Olson plays a screenwriter unable to unlock Holden's thoughts. She is engaged yet will face Holden's forced lifestyle in blunt terms.

These lines are corny and unconvincing to modern audiences.

The stereotyped butler (from Transylvania type) is totally unbelievable as Norma's first husband and her first film director just one of many silly unbelievable parts of the story.Since this movie is so ballyhooed and doesn't measure up I gave it a 4 (normally something like this would get a 5 or 6 from me).

The beginning is great, all mystery and ambiguity, the scene where we visit Paramount Studios and meet the real Cecil B DeMille directing while a spotlight is turned upon our crazy heroine is fantastic. But so much of this is mundane and repetitive. I understand Mae West was considered for the role and at first I thought, what nonsense, but on reflection perhaps playing this for laughs would have been preferable to this arch campiness. Holden is fine, not someone with much charisma, and I've certainly seen him better. What he lacks here is any sense that this is really going on. I know in 1950 a bed scene between the two would probably have been too much (though goodness knows there were enough film folk of maturity bedding nymphets at the time) but maybe just an unmade bed or something to indicate he had some connection with this wretched creature.",

            "content": "In the 100+ years of motion pictures, we've been treated to many gems, including a few set in Tinseltown itself. SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, THE PLAYER, and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN are excellent examples, but Billy Wilder's SUNSET BOULEVARD remains the greatest movie ever made about Hollywood. Its legendary status since 1950 has been so prevalent that it became a successful Broadway musical in the 1990's. Carol Burnett also parodied it on her long running variety television show.Wilder was such a mischievous filmmaker who knew this project would nibble at the fingers that fed him. With SUNSET BOULEVARD, he gave us a cynical exercise in portraying the Dream Factory as an eat-'em-'up and spit-'em-out business that treats its own as disposable commodities to be set aside when the next big thing arrives.Considering how Gloria Swanson and William Holden are so identified with the public as Norma Desmond and Joseph Gillis, it might surprise some to learn that neither was the first choice for those roles. Mary Pickford was the first actress asked to play Norma, but the former silent screen queen demanded multiple changes to her character. Big mistake, for the one thing Wilder would never compromise on was a script he painstakingly crafted together. Once Pickford was out, Mae West was approached, but she was indignant over the suggestion she was a has-been, despite being in her late fifties. Wilder's friend George Cukor suggested Swanson, who wasn't the slightest bit offended about the character and happily agreed to join.Although Montgomery Clift was the first actor considered to play Joe Gillis, he dropped out two weeks before shooting was about to begin. Apparently, the gigolo character hit a little too close to home in his private life, for he had an ambiguous relationship with torch singer Libby Holman. Enraged over Clift's reneging, Wilder quickly set about finding a replacement within the Paramount stable. After Fred MacMurray and Ray Milland declined the offer, William Holden enthusiastically said yes.SUNSET BOULEVARD begins with police cars speeding down the title roadway with sirens a-blaring until they arrive at a mansion. The dead body of a young man with three bullet holes in him is floating in the swimming pool. The voiceover narration is done by the corpse himself as the film flashes backward in time to almost a year, where Joe Gillis is a hack screenwriter with B-movies to his credits and debts to his name. Not only is he unable to interest Paramount in his latest script, but he can't secure a loan to keep up the car payments.Keeping one step ahead of the repo men, a tire blowout lands him in the driveway of a Hollywood mansion on Sunset Boulevard. After parking his car in the owner's garage, Gillis starts checking the place out. In voiceover, Joe accurately describes the property as similar to that of Miss Havisham, which anyone who's read \"Great Expectations\" or seen David Lean's movie version will understand right away. There's also a dilapidated looking pool that appears to have been last used when the stock market crashed. And Gillis hasn't been inside the mansion yet ....The home belongs to Norma Desmond, a faded silent screen legend who's never forgiven Hollywood for transitioning to sound. Being the perfect embodiment of the phrase \"living in the past\", Norma rails against the current crop of stars she disdainfully refers to as nobodies. All over her mansion are monuments to herself, photograph after photograph of her as she appeared in the Twenties. The only other person in her gothic web is her manservant Max (Erich von Stroheim), himself an oddball too.About to lay her late chimpanzee to rest, Norma mistakes Gillis for a funeral rep until discovering his true identity. Upon realizing that he's a screenwriter, she proposes hiring him to adapt her personal treatment about the life of Salome. Norma is so delusional that she thinks Cecil B DeMille will drop everything to work with her again despite her not having made a movie in over twenty years.Since he has nothing but mounting debts, Joe agrees to her offer, but there's a caveat. Paranoid about letting her pet project out of her sight, Norma insists that he work out of her mansion, with a spare room provided for him above the garage. Realizing that the bill collectors will never think of looking for him here, he accepts, but he soon finds himself restricted, and having the humorless Max hovering around doesn't make him feel any more relaxed.Gillis has the uneasy feeling his employer views him in more than a professional capacity, something confirmed when Norma arranges a private New Year's party for just the two of them. Her showering him with gifts such as tuxedos, cufflinks, and a gold plated cigarette case only increases his feelings of helplessness and confinement. His debts have been paid off, thanks to Norma, but it's come at a cost to his freedom now that he's a kept man.Creative stimulation arrives in the form of Betty Schaeffer, a script reader at Paramount hoping to become a writer herself. Her fiancee is a good pal of Joe's, an assistant director, and while he's on location in Arizona, she and Gillis pool their resources to type out their own original screenplay. But because of Norma's possessiveness, it's a project that must be done in secrecy.SUNSET BOULEVARD is a magnificent example of what happens when first-rate talents get together to create a work of art. I don't think even the great Bernard Herrmann could have provided a better music score than Franz Waxman does here. John Seitz does wonders with the photography, especially with his use of mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool...to obtain a frontal shot of the floating corpse.And according to Nancy Olson, who played Betty, Wilder and his team made sure that the dust and cobwebs of Norma's mansion were sprinkled about with mathematical precision. That's how meticulous their attention was to detail!!!When SUNSET BOULEVARD came out in 1950, Gloria Swanson received more acclaim for her performance of Norma Desmond than for any of her silent movies. The final shot of her melodramatically descending her staircase in a state of delusion is one for the ages. And when it came to his work in front of the camera, Erich von Stroheim has never been better.For William Holden, SUNSET BOULEVARD offered him the opportunity to move past what he derisively called his Smiling Jim roles and show what he was capable of when given the chance. It was a career altering movie for him. Holden, Swanson, von Stroheim, and Olson were all nominated forfor Academy Awards.The only people unhappy with SUNSET BOULEVARD were the moguls who didn't appreciate being implied as callous and uncaring -even though they were. One particular malcontent was Louis B Mayer, resident tyrant of M. G. M., who flew into a rage at Wilder following the premiere, accusing him of biting the hand that fed him. Undaunted, Wilder merely told him off with language that can't be used here.SUNSET BOULEVARD is another splendid feather in the cap of Billy Wilder.",

Sunset Boulevard is merciless in it's dissection of the film capital. By turns acerbic, nostalgic, vicious and hauntingly tragic, Sunset Boulevard is a ghost story. It features some of the greats from the movie capitals early years, now dusty and forgotten like Norma Desmond's mansion; the card game is like watching a seance.Gloria Swanson was, as the cliche has it, born to play Norma Desmond. Aided by William Holden and Victor Von Stroheim with cameos from some other silent era greats, she towers above the film. When she says: \"I'm still big, it's the films that got small.\" she is speaking the literal truth.Wilder led the way for other Hollywood talents to dissect the Dream Factory. None did so as bitingly or with such obvious love for his subject. For although he may be scathing about the system, he treats his characters lovingly. Ultimately they are tragic men and women who bought into the dream and discovered, too late, how superficial it is.The final \"Ready for my close up, Mr DeMille\" scene is painful, capturing acturately the beauty, sadness, tragedy and pointlessness of Hollywood's dream.",

            "content": "Los Angeles setting. Wry, reflective narration. Cutting dialogue, biting and sometimes grim or morbid humor, timeless cultural references. Above all: characters with huge personality; increasingly tangled relationships and circumstances; a course of events that slowly spirals out beyond manageability. This is a film noir, alright, and more than that, it's unquestionably one of the definitive pictures of the genre. Yet these are just broad descriptive terms for the nutritious substance of the movie - the details are the garnish, the spices, that add tremendous flavor. And, oh, how delicious it is. The production design and art direction are exemplary, filling every scene with delightful sights and sounds at every corner. The costume design, hair and makeup work, and above all set design and decoration are wonderfully fetching, a real treat for the eyes. The lines given to star William Holden for the protagonist's narration are brilliant in their sharp wit, and nigh poetic vocabulary and arrangement, and Holden delivers each with a dark panache that amounts to verbal instant gratification. And whatever the mood of a given scene, so it is for much of the dialogue at large, both Holden's, and Gloria Swanson's, and Erich von Stroheim's, and everyone's. In fact: it's one matter to see a feature described as one of the best movies ever made, but to watch it for oneself and confirm that truth is an altogether fabulous experience. Seventy years of acclaim do not lie - 'Sunset Boulevard' is an incredible, essential film.I don't know just how much one can discuss the particulars of a titanic title like this without betraying spoilers; as comprehensively stupendous as this is, to spotlight one component draws forth all the rest along with it. Consider the sizable cast, including parts for such luminaries as Buster Keaton and Cecil B. DeMille. Swanson gives the performance of a lifetime, vibrantly dynamic and charged, portraying fraught fading star Norma Desmond with dazzling presence and range that's surely among the greatest of all acting cinema has given us. Joe Gillis is a man filled with quiet, stewing complications, and Holden sells him with stark poise that belies a tumult of hope, lies, exploitation, and contempt. Von Stroheim, as Max, is a hushed yet sturdy anchor for the film, looming large at all times; Nancy Olson is a joy in her supporting part as Betty, offering warm, innocent respite from the more bleak undertones that course through the length. And so on and so on, down through the line. And at that, consider the fundamental building blocks of the picture: this is a feature by, of, and for Hollywood. The plot concerns a troubled writer and a desperate former star - the latter easy enough for anyone to conjure in an industry that too often soaks up dreams only to leave viscera trailing behind. There's a certain \"insider\" essence to 'Sunset Boulevard,' yet instead of glorification and self-indulgence, this saga brims with cynicism, self-loathing, and tangible dejection. And it's stunning from start to finish.The characters are rife with depth and complexity, and frankly the dialogue is humming with such electricity that I don't know if I can name any comparison. The scene writing is harsh and unforgiving, yet defined by just enough variety - and, again, no small measure of pitch black humor - that the summation is absolutely spellbinding as it propels a vivid, absorbing narrative. Meanwhile, in the same way that some straight dramas can elicit such reactions that they could feasibly be labeled as horror without even playing in that genre, the story here is so taut with tension and unease that it becomes earnestly thrilling, though the shoe itself wouldn't necessarily fit. The acting is entirely unimpeachable. The lighting, cinematography, shot composition, and direction generally are flawless, and crafted with careful artistry. And: not only is this a marvelous film noir, with ruefully knotted-up characters, and a drama with such palpable energy that it's very nearly a thriller. But moreover, as the screenplay zeroes in on the gradual escalation of pressure between the figures herein, and on their mental states that in a few different ways are bit by bit giving in to the strain - and as the assembled actors, Swanson above all, embody their roles with such powerful feeling - 'Sunset Boulevard' takes on significant airs of psychological drama, becoming ever more harrowing and sorrowful in the process. And still, after all that, the film ends not with a sad wail, but with a pointed, knowing gaze.What more is there to say? I could surely spill out still more words to describe all the ways in which this is an astonishing, captivating, must-see classic, but there comes a point where effusive praise becomes the inane babble of elated bewilderment. I cannot emphasize enough, or overstate: 'Sunset Boulevard' is one of the finest works of cinema that will ever be produced. It took me entirely too many years of my life to get around to watching it, and if there's the faintest hope that I can induce a potential viewer to expedite their own sitting, then these paragraphs will have been worth it. Watch this now. And buy it, so you can watch it again.Bravo, bravo, bravo!",

            "content": "'Sunset Blvd. (1950)', a veritable cinematic classic, is surprisingly meta, comprised almost entirely of interlaced 'Easter eggs' which take the form of 'art imitating life', celebrity cameos and, of course, movie references. This 'self-eating snake' nature is perhaps appropriate considering that the piece is still one of the best, most in-depth insights into - and a near damnation of - Hollywood, specifically 'old Hollywood'. It's also a keen portrayal of a sad kind of self-obsession usually associated with famous artists, one that the person often clings to beyond all hope primarily because their personality is so intrinsically tied to it. This self-perpetuating cycle of defining one's worth by how much strangers 'admire' them is certainly toxic and is, quite boldly, on full display. Ultimately, the picture is rather bleak, showcasing how society often enables dangerous behaviour by awarding it with their attention. The themes I've mentioned would be enough to float an entire flick but this one has even more still. It looks at money, financial security, loneliness, emasculation, creativity, mental illness and attention-seeking behaviour. It's remarkably interesting. It's also consistently entertaining, styled with a lavish 'noir' aesthetic that paints every frame, along with the usually decrepit things within them, in a beautiful black-and-white hue that somehow has a real thematic resonance in and of itself. The purposefully heavy-handed, hard-boiled but often flowery narration adds to the narrative's eerily enigmatic nature. The story is seemingly straight-forward, yet it's also oddly bizarre in the best way possible. Everything just feels like it's on top-form, here. The direction uses dazzling camera-work to invigorate the dialogue-based plot, beginning with an absolutely brilliant one-shot title-sequence and otherwise featuring its lion's share of inventive angles (the under-water shot is a real highlight and a proper bit of technical wizardry, too). The performances perfectly walk the line of realism and 'showbiz', with the balance being palpably different for each character. Swanson's Norma Desmond almost feels like she's acting in a silent movie, oozing intensity from every facial feature, whereas Holden's Joe Gillis slowly transitions from a 'Golden era' star to a paranoid, under-the-thumb man who thinks he's trapped with some sort of 'B-movie' monster and may actually like it. Tying everything together is this 'behind-the-scenes' feel. You're being taken on a tour of the very thing that produces pictures like this and people like Desmond. The more you read about it after the fact, the more you realise that it must've been shot through some sort of mirror. It may be a fictional tale, but it resembles reality in more ways than it doesn't and sometimes simply presents it to you (or a version of it, at least). Its haunting end is one of the most famous of all time but the whole affair is worthy of that status. It's an ahead-of-its-time experience that's as enjoyable as it impressive. As I said, it's a classic. 8/10",

Director Billy Wilder gives us the first of what will be many great shots, this one from what appears to be the bottom of the pool, with policemen in the background standing over the body. The film then flashes back to a young writer (William Holden), down on his luck and pressured by repo men, trying to figure out a way to sell his work or borrow some money. He pulls into the driveway of a mansion by chance, and finds himself slowly entangled in another trap, that of an aging Hollywood star (Gloria Swanson). The feel is eerie from the start, as she seeks funeral arrangements for her pet chimp, lives in boundless ostentation, and has a single companion, her solemn servant (Erich von Stroheim) who plays an organ that otherwise wheezes drearily when the wind blows through it. While her pool and tennis courts have fallen into ruin, she lives in the past, surrounded by her own photographs and watching her own old movies. Out of what he feels to be necessity, he begins working for her and living with her, hating every moment.Gloria Swanson, who was 51, turns in an outstanding performance, and has several fantastic scenes. The one where she and Holden sit in the dark with the projector light going through smoke is brilliant, and one of my favorites. Another is him dancing with her on the floor that she says Valentino had danced on, surrounded by an orchestra and expecting other guests, only to realize there will be none. The one where she imitates Charlie Chaplin, complete with a little tramp outfit, is truly special.Wilder is excellent at gradually revealing just how far gone she is. It was a nice touch of his to include silent movie stars as her bridge companions in a small scene, including Buster Keaton, and to see Cecil B. DeMille on the set at Paramount was fantastic. We see both her delusion of still being an important star as she rolls up to the gate house in her expensive old car (an Isotta-Fraschini), and yet we also see her past stardom recognized by one of the gate keepers, and then people on the set when they realize she's there. It's a very touching moment. Things get more complicated when Holden begins working with the fianc\u00e9 (Nancy Olson) of his affable friend (Jack Webb, soon to be better known for Dragnet). Not all of the scenes revolve around Swanson, and the one where Holden and Olson play act a romantic scene at a party is intelligent, funny, and utterly charming.The film gives us a behind the scenes look at Hollywood - brainstorming over scripts, the writing process, the vanity of those in the limelight, and the opulence. Swanson gets a little over the top at times especially towards the end, but the film feels both sadly true, and yet also fantastical, with her mansion other-worldly and not unlike that of the one Miss Havisham has in 'Great Expectations', as Holden observes early on. With such a setting and those poignant overtones, and having excellent direction, cinematography, script, and cast, it's hard to go wrong with this one.",

Swanson's performance is unforgettable here as she seamlessly immerses into her given role & plays Norma with such flawless finesse that it overshadowed almost every other aspect of this film.Nicely directed & brilliantly written by Wilder with many moments of sadness & wit cleverly glued together, Sunset Boulevard paints a remarkable yet pitiful portrait of a bygone actress living in a world of her own and is an immensely entertaining & hugely rewarding cinema about Hollywood that culminates with a much more tragic finish than expected by etching Norma Desmond's final shot into our minds for it to haunt us forever.

Everyone knew who she was, loved her films and her mind absolutely adored her. What Norma doesn't realize is that she has been out of the spotlight for a longtime. She has been hiding away in her once gorgeous home, holding on to what she once was. Her house is very reflective of what she herself had become over the years. The house hadn't received much attention and in turn has become dull and un-groomed; Norma Desmond did the same. Joe Gillis is a screenwriter that has also been struggling with his career. He manages to fall in to Norma's world, and in the end shatters it. Joe agrees to help Norma with her comeback film, but in the process realizes that nobody is waiting to see it. Norma's mental state isn't always logical, but her character makes you feel for her. She was once this beautiful actress that was on top of the film world; now she's lucky if she is a distant memory. This is a dark film that shows what fame can do to a person. Norma seems as though she is stuck in the spotlight and doesn't know how to live life otherwise.

Just us, and the cameras, and those wonderful people out there in the dark.\"Sunset Boulevard is a film with such a strong statement that it horrified many people that were offered to work on it. It criticizes Hollywood in a very strong way, a way that leaves an impact on the viewer.To give you a general idea of the plot: it follows Joe Gillis, a troubled Hollywood writer who's drowning in debts. As he runs away from the finance company he finds himself in a rather large mansion, being hired to fix a screenplay for a long forgotten Hollywood star Norma Desmond.As I've written above, this film is one painful criticizm of Hollywood - how it worships moneys instead of art, how it casts away anyone who isn't needed anymore, how it kills good writing. I think that esepcially in the final, haunting scene, the critcizm was evident and strong. It is said that Gloria Swanson just burst into tears after filming this scene, and I can definitely see why.Sunset Boulevard has many strengths - Swanson's acting gives so much life the Desmond's character, the score is on point and adds a lot to the film (especially during the opening sequence and during the final scene), the layers of criticizm here (both through the plot as an alagory and through the actual casting) are quite brilliant, and I appreciate this film a lot.I can't say that I have any big issue with this film, or any noteable one. I like it a lot, and I appreciate it even more.So, if you wanna get a creative, layered look into the cruelty of the film industry, Sunset Boulevard is definitely the film for you.

Finally getting to it, I found it to be one of the timeless ones, that's meta impact remains just as potent all these years later.Running from a debt collection, struggling Hollywood screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) ends up at the faded mansion of former Hollywood star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). Despite now being 50, and having not worked since the talkie's arrived, Norma is convinced that her self-written adaptation of Salome will be her root back to stardom. She engages Joe to edit her script and, seeing the opportunity for financial stability he agrees. Her delusions and obsession with him deepen and when he decides that she is not worth the stress, she takes matters into her own hands.Part film noir and part comedy, I was surprised at how genuinely funny \"Sunset Boulevard\" remains. It's mostly in Holden's scenes away from the house, at the start when he's trying to get a job or the scenes with Betty, played by Nancy Olson, who, for inexplicable reasons, also seems to fall in love with Joe, though there is quite a bit of chemistry in their verbal sparring. Swanson's overacting is striking at first, as she lurches around like a hungry Vampire, but it makes sense as you come to understand that she's essentially lost to her fantasy, stuck somewhere between the silent screen presence she once was and the addict desperately trying to organise another fix. She's never not magnetic though, whenever she's on the screen and deserved her Oscar nomination for the role.It also won one for best Art Direction, which perhaps should have been awarded solely for the iconic scene of a body floating in a swimming pool, shot from underneath, which looks impossible given the technology of the time, before a relatively simple trick allowed its production.Funny, dark, memorable and thought provoking, It truly is one of those films that is deserving of it's classic status.",

            "content": "This movie is really special. Not only does it show us a lot about the world of Hollywood during its golden age, but it also reveals a lot about the actors' egos, vanities and their titanic struggles to preserve their careers and stay in the limelight. Brilliantly directed by Billy Wilder, it is considered by many to be one of the great movie classics, combining entertainment, artistic value and cultural relevance. In 1951, it won three Oscars (Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction in a Black and White Film, Best Comic Film Soundtrack) and could perfectly have won one more, for Best Actress. But awards like these are never completely fair, especially in years so fertile for good films.Starting with the iconic scene of the dead man in the pool, the film intrigues us, and curiosity grips us, as the film shows how it all happened, introducing us to an average screenwriter who struggles to write a successful script that can leverage his career. He owes money, is in serious trouble and takes advantage of the opportunity to earn some easy money at the expense of a retired silent film actress, who decides to hire him to revise and type a script, written by herself and designed to mark her return. The script is mediocre, and he knows that the film will never happen, but he is coerced into silence, becoming the privileged eyewitness of the former star's gradual loss of lucidity. Of course, things get complicated as he loses his individual freedom and becomes more dependent on the whims and desires of his mistress.Despite the fiction, the film is based a lot on several loose true facts: one of them, the most obvious, is the fall of several actors in the course of the transition from silent to talking films. There were great actors who looked magnificent on screen and had great physical and facial expression, but who didn't survive this transition due to things as prosaic as a poor English fluency or a strange accent. Others, however, simply did not know how to understand and adapt to the novelty. The collapse of their careers and personal lives led to alcoholism, drugs, mental disorders. The film is able to condense almost all of this into a single character: Norma Desmond, the epitome of the fallen star.The cast has several well-known names, three of which - William Holden, Erich Von Stroheim and, obviously, Gloria Swanson - offer us the interpretation of their lives and their work of greater value and recognition. Of course, we cannot ignore that Swanson was a great star of silent cinema and that she shone in films like \"Trespasser\" or \"Indiscreet\", and that Holden would continue to be a highly sought actor after this, having won his Oscar for Best Actor in a film that starred two years later. But there is no doubt that this film immortalized the three of them.Technically, the film is impeccable, and the merit lies a lot in the brilliance of the dialogues, in the excellence of the conception and development of the characters, in the extraordinary way in which Wilder managed to get the best out of Swanson and lead the actress to a magnificent performance, which has so much to brilliant and difficult as well as provocative (especially from the point of view of many Hollywood shooting stars, who saw themselves in character and felt offended by it). With an excellent pace, the film does not waste time or let the atmosphere of tension and drama fall into a standstill. The mansion, owned by the Getty family, acquires character by itself as it becomes the most obvious symbol of the disturbed personality and only of its resident. The black and white cinematography is magnificent, and accentuates, in its details and shooting angles, the dramatic feel of the film. The soundtrack isn't memorable, but it's effective and functional.",

I have read through some of the film magazines at the time. I read letters from the fans displaying undying love for Clara Bow, Norma Talmadge, Jack Gilbert etc. Within the space of a year the fans had dumped them in favour of the new talkie stars. This film is a possible scenario of what might have happened to one of these stars.Like Miss Havisham in Dickens's Great Expectations Norma Desmond still lives in a time warp. She is still a star, and she is planning her big comeback. Her manservant, ex-director and ex husband humours her. But one day reality comes in the shape of her toyboy played by William Holden. She cannot face reality, so she kills it.This is possibly the first time that Hollywood got to grips with the stories of what has happened to people who were spat out by the film industry.",

At the opposite end of the spectrum are the self absorbed, obsessed and enveloped by their own importance.Sunset Blvd.'s Gloria Swanson is one such figure. Twenty years past her sell-by date, but still wallowing in her once glittering career as a silent star. Existing as a recluse, with only servant Erich von Stroheim for company. Driven by the fantasy of a glorious return to the screen.Enter floundering, creatively bankrupt hack, William Holden, who realizes too late that not scrounging, scraping and scrimping the outstanding payment on his car proves to be a costly mistake. A wardrobe full of expensive clothes and a primarily liquid diet of vintage champagne cannot disguise the fact that by parking his ailing automobile in Swanson's garage he has become imprisoned in her bizarre, unreal world.Holden's onerous task of transforming Swanson's muddled, woeful scripts into a marketable finished product for Cecil B. DeMille at Paramount, in order to rekindle the all but forgotten star's career, is nothing short of a' silk purse from a sow's ear' undertaking. Throw in the added ingredient of Swanson's constant meddling and it descends into a challenge as thankless as polishing a cowpat. Meanwhile, Swanson remains blissfully ignorant of the fact that both she and the industry that once embraced her, have both changed beyond recognition.Overlong, overrated and occasionally overbearing Wilder's dark satire nonetheless, presents a unique insider's view of a Hollywood on the brink of the big collapse. Studio-bound and stagy, seven decades on Sunset Bvld. has lost much of the universal potency and paramount importance evident at the time of its release. Notwithstanding, it remains an incisive statement on the mercurial nature of stardom and the potential damage it can wreak upon those who become intoxicated by its allure.

The character of Norma Desmond is very enigmatic and I'm sure it must have resonated with many actresses of the time.I was slightly disappointed by William Holden though. He was a very handsome chap, but he doesn't play an attractive character, so it wasn't easy to feel sorry for him in his situation, which I felt with the stage version. It was hard to like either character really and I just ended up on the butlers side.The story has a similar feel to Great Expectations with it's older lady fallen in to disrepair in a home of the same shabby aesthetic who works with a younger man, although for slightly different motives.I do love stories of old Hollywood or any \"Backstage Pass\" film. The glory days must have been very exciting and that comes across here on the sets. The glamour and the excesses all seem so appealing.I think the film is well and truly overdue for a remake, but not necessarily a revamp. The time frame is perfect or even a tad late.

            "content": "Silver screen classics, particularly noir films, drain the life force out of me. They require effort, stamina and widened blood-shot eyes in order to bypass the often gruelling glacial pace commonplace in films of that era. Then you get the odd few, '12 Angry Men' for example, that surpass even the greatest of expectations. Offering more captivation than a modern masterpiece, ageing finer than a bottle of Ch\u00e2teauneuf du Pape. This, ladies and gentlemen, is why we watch films. Sunset Boulevard may just be one of the most proficiently entrancing films I've ever watched, and I adored it.An unsuccessful screenwriter is hired by a faded silent-film star to write her screenplay, marking her ambitious return to the silver screen. Yet, when delusions become obsessions, her paranoid fantasies start to shroud him in a poisonous fog of wealth and ownership.Before I envelope myself in my own stream of consciousness, I want to start with some bold statements. Here goes nothing! Swanson's role as Norma Desmond is one of the greatest performances of all-time. Wilder and Brackett's screenplay is one of the greatest scripts of all-time. And, Sunset Boulevard is possibly the greatest story about Hollywood. Period. Now, just let those comments sink in for a moment. Much like you, I am also surprised by the overwhelming praise that flooded my mind as I watched this. But it happened. The infamous quote was executed. \"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up\". And it was the first time I noticed that I blinked. For nearly two hours, I was hypnotised by the level of quality that was being output way back in 1950. Stunned into silence, I had to patiently wait for the overwhelming sense of perfection to leave my body.Sunset Boulevard was effortlessly perfect, and the majority of that stems from Swanson's excruciatingly realistic performance. This drama, first and foremost, is a character study. A silent-film star trapped in her own deluded mind where fame, fortune and popularity is left unchanged. Her refusal to accept change, her inability to progress, her latching onto her own self-importance. It's regressed her mentality into a state of delusional grandeur. Forming a tangible fantasy of her fabled \"return\" to the screen.Wilder's close attention to Swanson's theatricality grants us minuscule details when depicting her regressed state. The exaggerated body movement, particularly of the arms and face, are a secondary result of her excessive work in the silent-film era, almost likening her to a vampiric entity. The schizophrenic behaviour, instantly switching between happiness and melancholy, encapsulating her broken mental state. And none of this, absolutely none of it, would've been possible without Swanson's masterful performance. In fact, it's one of the greatest. She beautifully realised the character of Norma Desmond with an equal balance of power and fragility. It may just be one of the most accurate performances depicting melancholy that I've had the pleasure of viewing. Her range was extraordinary, and she devoured every single artistic set piece.Then you get Holden's illusory narration that exhumes the mind of a skilled writer. The flow, tempo and idyllic vocabulary. A poetic river that explored the illusory world of Hollywood. It instantly ensnared me with its sharp dialogue, allowing us to empathise and sympathise with his reluctant choices. Wilder's humour, and believe me there are some giggles to be had, compliments the delusory world being depicted. Fractured, almost. One scene you'll smile, the next you'll glance in fear. A clashing of tones orchestrated to produce a gorgeous symphony of thematic competence.Wilder's strong directorial hands ensured that the splitting of tones was minimal, only allowing subtle hints of fragility to seep through the cracked walls of the dilapidated mansion. A microcosm for the incongruous mind of Norma Desmond. Such simplistic yet memorable art design that emitted a trapped state of disrepair.Waxman's soothing score also alluding to a fantastically perfect world that Desmond embraced, yet still managing to draw up tension when required with erratic pitch changes. The majestic costumes, the concise editing, the gorgeous cinematography, the supporting performances. Nothing in this picture was wrong, and that's a rare statement for me to make.The ethereal aesthetic, considering it's entirely narrated by a murdered victim, only enhances the ghostly quality of its lead character. It's acute depiction of Hollywood's evolution, never steering away from its extremities, makes it one of the best films exploring the industry. It's definitive. It's sensational. It's perfect. Yes, Sunset Boulevard has just acquired the highest score possible. If ever there was a classic you need to watch, this is the one.",

I can't think of any other film from that time that explores the idea of being a \"has been\" in terms of Hollywood society. The acting is superb all around, with special recognition deserved by the two leads. Gloria Swanson a fantastic job playing, well herself...but crazy.

            "review_title": "Truly excellent film about Hollywood",
            "content": "Director/writer Billy Wilder and associates have created a film that rises above even the level of even a lot of the best melodramatic films of its era by ingeniously creating a device \u0096 the story focused on a silent film star and her distorted self-image \u0096 that encompasses the style and limitations of melodramatic acting itself, making a performance from Gloria Swanson as former Sennet bathing beauty Norma Desmond seem perfectly appropriate even at times when it might otherwise have been considered laughable. In fact the film in general shows a real black comic streak, right from its famous opening shot of screenwriter-turned gigolo Joe Gillis (William Holden) floating face-down in Desmond's swimming pool.One thing that stands out in the film is that it manages to be at the same time a very caustic fable about the allure and corruption of Hollywood while paying tribute to the classic era of silent films. Now that the film itself is older than the films it was then paying tribute to, it seems if anything more poignant then ever. It's true that Desmond eventually becomes a ridiculous person, but if anything the pathetic nature of her later years accentuates the marvel and the dignity of her earlier stardom and the era when she ruled the box-office. I'd actually be surprised if many people have not been introduced to the romance and majesty of silent cinema through this film \u0096 a film which ironically mocks the \"talk, talk, talk\" of the sound era while including some of its very best dialog. Although in many ways more grotesque than the average Lon Chaney or Boris Karloff character, Norma Desmond also captures the sympathy of the audience like all great movie monsters. It's possible to see Norma as a \"femme fatale\", but I think her situation too pitiful for that designation \u0096 I would liken her instead to Frankenstein's misunderstood and abandoned Monster (created as she was by Max, after all) or to the regal Dracula, hiding from the modern world in his ancient castle while he waits for new blood to devour and corrupt.There's a great deal of sadness and mystery, too, in this concept of 1920s Hollywood as a kind of lost and unlamented world. This is of course heightened by the presence of supporting actors like Buster Keaton, Ana Q. Nilsson, and especially director Erich Von Stroheim \u0096 like Swanson playing a thinly-disguised grotesque version of himself. Von Stroheim's Max is, like the troubled artist himself, a former director; his present-day role as a butler is fitting also because Von Stroheim had to play a number of such menial roles in his later years. \"Sunset Boulevard\" provided a once-in-a-lifetime chance for Von Stroheim and Swanson to show their powers once again; it's hard to believe either of them could really have thought of it as a \"comeback\" (the film's dialogue even mocks such pretensions), and they both give the kind of impassioned performances that leave no doubt that these brilliant performers have held absolutely nothing back, giving us two of the most honest and nakedly human performances of the era.My only complaint about the film is relatively minor \u0096 I've always felt that Joe Gillis is just too observant, world-wise, and engaging to really fall so completely into Norma Desmond's desperate clutches. The build-up is superbly handled, with the (often un-necessary and occasionally obtrusive) narration clueing us in to the fact that he thinks he can con Desmond initially but gradually becomes entangled in her life. I've just never completely believed the scene where Gillis leaves his friend's part to run home to Norma because of her suicide attempt. It's an effective scene, no doubt \u0096 Von Stroheim's manner and his announcement are so startling in the context of the revelry surrounding Gillis that the audience probably doesn't pause much to wonder why he is so upset or if he really would go back there right away. Frankly it seems to me like it should have confirmed his feeling that he needed to escape that place. Are we to believe Gillis' pronouncement that Norma was the only person in Hollywood who was good to him? And is his guilt enough to motivate him to return and become her lover, or is he primarily just a scared and bitter man seeking some asylum from the world? Certainly his character is intriguing but I've just never believed such a likable, interesting guy who really knows better and has good friends (especially frisky Betty Schaefer, played by Nancy Olson, a character which vaguely reminds me of Betty Comden) supporting him would feel the need to shut himself up alive in a metaphorical coffin. Just because I don't want to believe it, though, doesn't mean it might be too close to true for comfort.I'm always fascinated by stories that break down the \"fourth wall.\" This film succeeds in this difficult manoever with incredible style and verve. This is a film about success \u0096 the great prize of huge success which destroys the possibility of joy derived from less grandiose endeavors, and the sad and equally great price of failure when it comes from resignation and fear. These characters touch us deeply because it's impossible not to see their greatness, and through witnessing their tragic downfall we become conscious of our own limitations within a culture that determines the value of a human being through such narrow parameters. \"It's amazing how gentle people treat you when you're dead.\" Our deceased narrator reminds us \u0096 this great film by Billy Wilder urges us to shed some tears for the living as well, trapped as we all are in such an ultimately senseless and uncaring world.",

In it a struggling film writer, Joe Gillis (William Holden), happens to meet a former silent film megastar, the dazzling Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She hires him to finish the script she has written, which is supposed to be her great comeback into cinema. But soon Joe finds himself pulled deeper and deeper into her life.I have to admit I have a fondness for movies that are about movies and the business of making them. Hollywood has built quite a legend around itself, a mythos even, and it is admittedly fascinating to watch.This movie is more about actors and acting than it is about movies in general, and it has quite a cynical tone to it. I very much like the fact that they cast an actual star of the silent movie era in Glorian Swanson. Gives the film authenticity. In Swanson you can see echoes of the distant past when movie stars lived like demigods, while the studios built entire sagas around their star power alone. Sure, this star power was carefully built, maintained and patented by the studios themselves. Not that this makes it any less interesting. Quite the opposite.Holden's performance is not bad at all, but it pales in comparison to Swanson's. Holden also talks a lot, providing the film with narration. I think I would have preferred the film without his constant input, but it's hard to say. He does add much needed snark, if nothing else.If we're talking about Billy Wilder movies, I liked both The Apartment and Witness for the Prosecution a lot more, but this one ain't bad either.

            "content": "\"Sunset Boulevard\" or if you will \"Sunset Blvd.\" is a classic Billy Wilder noir-ish tale of a forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and a down on his luck screen writer Joe Gillis (William Holden and their May-December relationship.Gillis turns into a driveway while running from finance company representatives who are trying to repossess his car. On the grounds Gillis discovers an old mausoleum of a mansion that has fallen into disrepair. Mistaken for an undertaker, Gillis is invited inside where he discovers that the owner of the house is none other than Norma Desmond and her servant Max (Eric von Stroheim).At first Gillis wants to flee but then sees an opportunity to make some money off the lonely Desmond. The opportunity becomes reality when Norma invites Joe to move in where she showers him with money and gifts in return for his affection. All goes well until Joe becomes involved with studio employee Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olsen) with whom he falls in love. This leads to tragic consequences for both Norma and Joe.Gloria Swanson was anything but the lonely forgotten silent film star she portrays in this film. There were however, some interesting parallels to her own life. She did actually work for Cecil B. De Mille (who has a cameo in this film) and was directed by Stroheim in \"Queen Kelly\" (1928). She had faded from films in the 30s but kept working on the stage and in the occasional film. \"Queen Kelly\" is the film that Norma screens for Joe where she vows to return to past glory.For Holden, this was the film that made him a super star rather than just another contract leading man. He plays a totally self-serving character who uses Norma to his own ends.Stroheim who was best known for his extravagant direction of silent films, was actually a pretty good actor as well. His performance as Max, Norma's faithful former husband/director/protector stands up with those of Swanson and Holden.Also in the cast are Fred Clark as Sheldrake the movie producer, Jack Webb as Joe's friend Artie Green, Hedda Hopper as herself and as the \"wax works\" playing bridge, former silent stars Anna Q. Nilsson, Buster Keaton and H.B. Warner. Nilsson is shown puffing away on a cigarette, Warner looks asleep but Keaton (misused again) manages to get in one of his signature dead pan expressions in his brief appearance.A marvelous film and another Billy Wilder classic.",

            "content": "Sunset Blvd. is probably the Billy Wilder movie that Hollywood loves the most because it's about Hollywood. The problem that Hollywood movies tend to have and occasionally fall completely into is that they are insular without appeal to those not of the business. Sunset Blvd. is definitely full of the kinds of references Hollywood movies are tend to carry, but the central story is as relatable and fascinating from a basic human point of view that really gets the audience involved from beginning to end.Everyone is just out of place in this movie. The most obvious example is Norma Desmond, the silent star who's desperate to make it in the new Hollywood, but the rest of them are looking to move from the place where they reside to the place they wish to be. In the process, they have to play parts that they don't feel quite comfortable with. That conflict, which is present through every major character in the film, is what gives the film such a rich narrative texture.Joe Gillis is a down and out writer from the Midwest trying to make his way in Hollywood, but nothing he writes appeals to anyone anymore. He's on his last dollar and beginning to think about going back home. Running from repo men, he drives into a seemingly abandoned driveway which happens to be owned by Norma Desmond. In his desperation, he ends up as effectively her pet, replacing the pet monkey she buries on his first night in the house. What develops is an odd relationship (implied sexual) where Norma lords over Joe and Joe becomes completely subservient to Norma's whims. He accepts it to a certain degree, but he still chafes under it.He escapes nights at a time and meets with Betty Schaefer, a low level reader at the movie studio, to hammer out a screenplay that could make both of their careers (or not, Joe admits). Betty grew up in a Hollywood family and wants to be a real screenwriter instead of just a reader. She's on one end of the writing career path (Joe is on the other), and they're trying to meet in the middle. She's pretty, smart, a realist, and engaged to someone else.Through all of this, Norma is trying to get back into the spotlight. Her isolated life with only her butler, Max, has warped her mind. Max has directed her life in the background, writing fan letters for her every week and managing her day to day existence. She's writing an overlong screenplay of the Princess Salome (who was a teenager at the interesting points in her life) whom she plans to play (despite being in her fifties). She's the ultimate portrait of self-delusion, wearing a mask that she can't see through but everyone else can. She's convinced that she's just one writer and a single meeting with Cecile B. DeMille from getting her Salome on the screen. Joe is obviously that writer (admitting to us in voiceover that the script is terrible and no amount of his work on it will improve it). All along the way, even through her meeting with DeMille, everyone admits to themselves and to others Norma's delusion, but no one will shatter it for her.Joe's cynicism is what carries him through his experience overall, but it's also what allows him to finally be the one person to shatter Norma's vision of herself. The decades of her delusion, though, don't mix well with the revelation and Norma shoots Joe in the back, ending the movie where it began with Joe floating in Norma's pool.The movie is a wonderful look at delusion and deception, a very common motif in Wilder's work. The characters are rich with a great mixture of characters across the cynicism spectrum, each dealing with their own desires to be in their ideal places. Acting is great across the board, and the writing is elegantly assembled and witty all at once. It's a great piece of entertainment that thematically rich, visually resplendent, and just a fantastic time at the movies.",

Not having had any successes for a while, his car is about to be repossessed and his erstwhile boss \"Sheldrake\" (Fred Clark) has nothing for him. On the run from the pursuing repo men, he turns his car into the drive of a decaying old mansion. Hiding his car in the garage, he is mistaken by the house's owner for an undertaker - she has a small matter that needs attending too! Realising her error she demands he leave, but not before he mentions what he does for a living. She has a script. Hundreds of pages of script - and she offers him a job, champagne and caviar if he will edit and refine it so \"Norma Desmond\" (Gloria Swanson), a retired former silent movie star, can present it to her favourite director Cecil B DeMille and restart her glorious career. Initially just seeing dollar signs, he agrees and what now ensues is a masterfully crafted story of love, dependency, ambition and delusion in which Swanson absolutely shines. It's clear to us from the outset that her grasp on reality is somewhat limited, and but for her dedicated factotum \"Max\" (Erich von Stroheim) she might well have fallen victim to her own depression many years ago. Holden is also on solid form here, his initial selfishness starts to morph into something more, he begins to care for this woman whose head is increasingly in the clouds, and upon whom she is becoming more reliant. The dialogue is delivered via a mix of Holden's quite honest narrative and the conversations between the characters delivering some of the best lines in cinema - \"I'm still big - it's the world that's got smaller!\". The mental decline and instability of \"Desmond\" is expertly displayed here by a star who new a thing or two herself about the silent film scene, and who brings her facial expressions, her mannerisms and her generally star-studded demeanour to bear really effectively as the audience gradually realise that nothing here is going to pan out as it seems - or as anyone wants. Von Stroheim underplays his supporting role with aplomb and though I didn't really love the sub-plot with Nancy Olson's \"Betty Schaefer\" - it took away from the intensity of the main storyline - it did to serve to illustrate just how powerful jealousy can be. This is a super film, that still captivates on a big screen and is really well worth sitting down to watch.,",

Arguably his finest script Sunset also gets career highs from pantheon cinematographer Joseph Seitz and composer Franz Waxman whose score not content to just provide background intricately attaches itself to the action, accenting one powerful scene after the next.Aspiring screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) is trying to stay one step ahead of the finance company out to repossess his car when takes shelter in an old movie star's run down mansion. Mistaken for an undertaker there to wake her dead monkey he's persuaded to stay in a room over the garage but the washed up silent star Norma Desmond has other designs for him. He chafes at the gigolo role but finds the lavish lifestyle hard to reject. When he connects with another writer as collaborator and romantic interest he decides to make a final break from the unstable Desmond.Holden's sardonic narration and Gloria Swanson's delusional Norma deliver Wilder and Leigh Bracket's biting script with emphasis in every word as morbid humor mixes with tragedy within the suffocating stage of the oppressive mansion along with the dour butler (perfectly played by Erich Von Stroheim) and the few visitors, actual former silent stars playing themselves, referred to by Gillis as \"the waxworks.\"Also playing themselves are a sensitive but forceful Cecil B. DeMille and a shrewish Hedda Hopper as well as the Paramount Studio itself. There is also a fine supporting performance by Nancy Olsen as the late love interest but nothing surpasses the strident performance of Swanson that some may argue is over the top in spots while at the same time demanding it to be effective. Sunset Boulevard is an expressionistic masterpiece by one of Hollywood's best displaying it at its worst. Superb celluloid theatre.",

            "content": "I finally saw Sunset Boulevard on DVD this week. I had never seen this classic film before. Gloria Swanson made the most of this comeback role by delivering a great performance as silent film legend Norma Desmond. Creepy and self-delusional, Norma has basically imprisoned herself and her manservant Max in a run-down Hollywood mansion. Life at the mansion is disturbed when young script writer Joe Gillis (played by the always excellent William Holden) uses the garage as a hideout running away from his car's repo men.Events begin to unfold which leave Joe questioning his own morality and standards. I won't get any further into the plot details just in case there are any other people out there like myself who haven't seen this film.A few interesting details I have learned about this movie which might interest some folks out there. Both Mae West and Mary Pickford were offered the Norma Desmond role before Gloria Swanson. Mae West didn't get it because she wanted to rewrite much of Norma's dialog. That was not acceptable to director Billy Wilder, who didn't allow any deviation from the script. Mary Pickford always retained ownership rights to her silent films. That wasn't going to happen with Sunset Boulevard so Pickford was out. Montgomery Clift was first offered the pivotal role of writer Joe Gillis and actually accepted the part. Thinking about the role while on vacation in Europe Clift came to the conclusion that the \"kept man \" aspect of Joe Gillis' relationship with Norma Desmond too closely mirrored his real life relationship with a wealthy New York socialite. Clift turned the role down upon his return to America.Hollywood had very mixed reactions to this film. Famous MGM mogul Louis B. Mayer stormed out after an early screening of Sunset Boulevard and engaged Billy Wilder in a very profane tirade accusing Wilder of stabbing the film industry in the back. Wilder gave as good as he got to the red-faced Mayer. If you haven't seen Sunset Boulevard do yourself a favor and check out this classic. It will stick with you for a while.",

William Holden, the then (1950) star of the movie is shown playing the role of a Hollywood \"player\" (a writer) who ends up with a lonely, humiliating death. He went on to win a Best Actor Academy Award for Stalag 17 (1953) and was future USA President Ronald Reagan's best man at Reagan's 1952 shot-gun, justice of the peace wedding to his pregnant bride, Nancy Davis (Reagan's daughter, Patty Davis, who went on to pose nude for Playboy Magazine, was born 7 months after the wedding...the bride, Nancy Davis, was later first lady of the USA Nancy Reagan...\"good girls go to heaven...bad girls go everywhere!\").Holden went on to die alone in a humiliating way in the early 1980's (found dead for days alone in his apt.), and Reagan went on to be USA President....occupied the White house when Holden was found dead.Holden became what he portrayed. This happens a lot in the movies. A word to the wise for movie stars and other actors...be careful what roles you play....you may end up playing these roles in real life.Gloria Swanson plays an old lady in this movie, and still hadn't reached age 50. Compare her with Cher, roughly the same age in Moonstruck (1987) who won a Best Actress Academy Award which included romantic nude sex bedroom scenes with much younger Nicholas Cage (roughly the same age as William Holden when Holden acted in Sunset Blvd. [1950]).Cher stayed gorgeous in her 40's, became the mother of a famous homosexual daughter turned \"male\" first named \"Chastity,\" then re-named \"Chaz,\" not a bit as pretty as Mom...bad weight problem, among other problems. That's Hollywood! Swanson and Cecil B. DeMille both acted in Sunset Blvd. (1950) and both were very good. Two of the biggest major players in silent era world cinema history....this movie is worth seeing just to look at them, see them talk, see why they were so good at what they did.The final scene shows the hero getting shot in the back....by the other hero in the movie.No epic is big enough for two heroes.

So she decides to hire the boy to write the script for her next film.I'm in love with this film, everything about it is incredible, soundtrack, direction, visual and obviously Gloria Swanson's brilliant performance, which I consider one of the best female performances in cinema.

In both films the character of the aging actress was played by an aging actress. Bette Davis (42) in \"All about Eve\" and Gloria Swanson (51) in \"Sunset boulevard\".In \"All about Eve\" Bette Davis is aware of the fact that her career is coming to an end. This makes her cynical and the strongest point in \"All about Eve\" is the sharp dialogue.In \"Sunset boulevard\" Gloria Swanson keeps dreaming of a come back. This makes her a tragic person. The strongest point in \"Sunset boulevard\" is the acting style of Swanson. With her major successes in the '20s this acting style was already very dated in 1950. This however fits in perfectly with the character she plays in \"Sunset boulevard\".Ironically \"All about Eve\" turned out to be the come back of Bette Davis while \"Sunset boulevard\" definitely was the last great film of Gloria Swanson.",

Every facet of the film is done so well, especially the performances by the ever talented actors. Gloria Swanson absolutely made this film, her performance will blow you away. She commands every scene she's in, she has to because of her character. Her character is so complex and interesting, so much so that it's impossible to look away. The story revolves around a man who stumbles upon an old seemingly abandoned mansion and meets a middle aged washed up actress named Norma Desmond. She showers him with lavish gifts and lets him stay at her Hollywood mansion in exchange for him reading a script she wrote and editing it for her. Eventually, things become very complicated when other factors are thrown into the mix. And then that's where we get the real meat of the film. It really is a great film that is very entertaining. It may be very old, but it'll never lose it's quality or it's well deserved place on the list of the most famous films ever. 9/10",

Many of us know the story, or have seen parodies of it (for example, on the Carol Burnett show). But if you have any interest in Old Hollywood, you will love this film. It touches on isolation, aging, psychosis, and melodrama in a most unique way.The visuals are Gothic and haunting. The old terrazzo floor on which Valentino danced the tango, the old stars at Norma Desmond's house, discarded, playing cards to pass the time. The omniscient Olympic sized swimming pool, never haunted by guests. A mansion filled with memories and mementos, but not people.Sunset Boulevard today has but a few old buildings, modern life has all but erased the Old Hollywood which existed at that time. Today it is a strange anachronism to see Grauman's Chinese Theatre, and advertisements next to it, for todays movies . This film is worth seeing more than once. 10/10.",

            "content": "In the 100+ years of motion pictures, we've been treated to many classics, including a few set in Tinseltown itself. Despite the excellence of such examples as SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS, THE PLAYER, and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, Billy Wilder's SUNSET BLVD remains the greatest movie ever made about Hollywood. Its legendary status since then has been so prevalent that it became a successful Broadway musical in the 1990s. Carol Burnett even parodied it in her long running variety television show.Wilder was a mischievous filmmaker who knew that this project would bite at the fingers that fed him. With SUNSET BLVD, he gave us a cynical exercise portraying the Dream Factory as an eat-'em-up-and-spit-'em-out business that treats its own as disposable commodities to be set aside when the next big thing comes along.Considering how Gloria Swanson and William Holden are so identified with the public as Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis, it might surprise some to learn that neither was the first choices for those roles. Mary Pickford was the first actress considered for Norma, but the silent film queen demanded changes to the character. Big mistake, for the one thing Wilder would never compromise on was a script he painstakingly put together. Once Pickford was out, Mae West was approached, but she was indignant over the suggestion that she was a has-been, despite the fact that West was in her late fifties. Wilder's friend George Cukor suggested Swanson, who wasn't the slightest bit offended about the character and happily agreed to take part.Although Montgomery Clift was the actor originally slated for the part of Joe Gillis he dropped out two weeks before filming was to begin. Apparently, the gigolo character hit a little too close to home to him in his private life, as he had a ambiguous relationship with Libby Holman. Enraged, Wilder quickly sought a replacement within the Paramount stable. After Fred MacMurray and Ray Milland declined the offer, William Holden's name was next, and he happily agreed to take on the role.SUNSET BLVD opens with police cars speeding down the title roadway with sirens a-blaring. They arrive at a mansion where the dead body of a young man with three bullet holes is floating in the swimming pool. The voiceover narration is done by the corpse himself, as the film flashes back almost a year, where Joe Gillis is a hack screenwriter with B-movies to his credit and debts to his name. He's not only unable to interest Paramount in his latest script, but can't even secure a personal loan so he can keep his car.Keeping one step ahead of the repo men, a tire blowout lands him in the driveway of a Hollywood mansion on Sunset Boulevard. After parking his vehicle in the owner's garage, Gillis starts checking out his temporary sanctuary. In voiceover, Joe accurately describes the place as similar to that of Miss Havisham, which anyone who's read \"Great Expectations\" or seen David Lean's movie version will understand right away. There's a dilapidated looking swimming pool that appears to have last been used when the stock market crashed. And Gillis hasn't even set foot inside the mansion yet....The home belongs to Norma Desmond, a faded silent screen legend who's never forgiven Hollywood for transferring to sound. She's the perfect embodiment of the phrase living in the past\", railing against the current crop of movie stars she disdainfully refers to as nobodies. All over her mansions are monuments to herself, photograph after photograph of her as she appeared back in the roaring Twenties. The only other person in her gothic web is her manservant Max (Erich von Stroheim), himself an oddball too.About to lay her late chimp to rest, Norma mistakes Gillis for a funeral rep until discovering his true identity. Upon realizing that he's a screenwriter, she proposes hiring him to adapt her own personal treatment about the life of Salome. Norma is so delusional that she thinks Cecil B DeMille will drop everything to work with her again, despite the fact she hasn't made a movie in twenty years.Since he has nothing but debts mounting, Joe agrees, but there's a caveat. Paranoid about letting her pet project out of her sight, she insists that he work at her mansion, with a spare room provided for him above the garage. Realizing that bill collectors will never think of looking for him here, he agrees, but soon finds himself feeling restricted, and having the humorless Max hovering over doesn't make him feel any more comfortable.Gillis has an uneasy feeling his employer views him in more than just a professional capacity, something confirmed when Norma arranges a private New Year's party for just the two of them. Her showering him with gifts such as tuxedos, cufflinks, and a gold-plated cigarette case only increases his feelings of helplessness and confinement. His debts have been paid off thanks to Norma, but it's come at a cost to his freedom now that's he's become a kept man, a gigolo.Creative stimulation arrives in the form of Betty Schaeffer, a script reader at Paramount hoping to become a writer herself. Her fiancee is a pal of Joe's, an assistant director, and while he's on location in Arizona, she and Gillis pool their resources to work on their own story. But because of Norma's possessiveness, it's a project that has to be done in secrecy.SUNSET BLVD is a magnificent example of what happens when first-rate talents get together to create a work of art. I don't think even the great Bernard Herrmann could have provided a better music score than Franz Waxman does here. John Seitz does wonders with the cinematography, especially with his use of mirrors on the bottom of the swimming pool to obtain a frontal shot of the floating corpse. And according to Nancy Olson, who played Betty, Wilder and his team made sure that the dust and cobwebs of Norma's mansion were laid out with mathematical precision. That's how meticulous they were!When SUNSET BLVD came out in 1950, Gloria Swanson received more acclaim for her performance as Norma Desmond than any of her silent movies. The final shot of her melodramatically descending her staircase in a state of delusion is one for the ages. And when it came to his work in front of the camera, Erich von Stroheim has never been better either. For William Holden, SUNSET BLVD allowed him the opportunity to move past what he derisively referred to as his \"Smiling Jim\" roles, and show what he was capable of when given the chance. It was a career altering movie for him. Holden, Swanson, von Stroheim, and Olson were all nominated for Oscars.The only people unhappy with SUNSET BLVD were the moguls who didn't appreciate being implied as callous and uncaring. One in particular was Louis B Mayer, chairman of M. G. M., who raged at Wilder following the premiere, accusing him of biting the hand that feeds him. Undaunted, Wilder merely told him to stick it where the sun doesn't shine.SUNSET BLVD is another splendid feather in the cap of Billy Wilder.",

            "content": "I'm not really sure what to say about this film. You have to be a little crazy to want into an industry whose motto is \"what have you done for me lately\", but then again Norma Desmond played by Gloria Swanson is a little touched in the head to begin with.Fame and wealth for being popular with people is a pretty heady thing. Just ask any professional athlete. For the aging actress in Hollywood s golden era it's a death knell. The kind of thing that can drive a person insane. And so it is with Desmond, the kind of actress who wanted nothing but attention, and not the ability to work the inner craftsmanship that goes into a major motion picture. She misses the attention, the glitz, the glamour of being \"a star\", and nothing more. Like another reviewer stated, this is a pretty cynical film. But it's also over the top, which offsets the imagined cynicism. I guess there's a romanticism there that personal attachments will clash with business practicalities, and that that collision will produce an attention getting dynamic for all to witness. Norma can't see that the latter is what's pushed her aside, and that not matter how much she fawns and desired to be fawned, that her glory days in the eyes of Paramount Studios, are over. It drove her crazy.As for the rest of the film, like I say, it's over the top. The performances are borderline melodrama, the plot is thin but plausible for a woman on the wane, and the characters, like the film, are also a little too much as well.Well, I think of my own film career, and I wonder if I'm not on the Norma Desmond side of things at this point in my life. Eh, like I give a damn.See it once. If you're into the whole \"Hollywood\" thing (you're a woman or homosexual man with stars in their eyes, and like \"glam\"), then this might entertain. It's touted as a classic. I can see why, but I wouldn't rank it as one.Just me.p.s. with all of the sugary and happy Hollywood endings of other films, this one was intentionally geared to go against the market trend, and it worked.",

The casting of Von Stroheim, Swanson, Webb, and of course Holden is perfect. The cameo with DeMille incredible. Maybe its because I am a filmmaker myself that I get so much joy out of this film.

Well, Sunset Boulevard answers that non-specific question in a beautiful fashion and then some by telling a story about 'delusions of grandeur' and how time's passage can become an unforgiving beast for movie stars still gloating about their 'good old days'. Norma Desmond is an out-of-touch actress who's refused to come to terms with, or accept, reality. She happens to come across struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis escaping from the men who lent him his car. After skidding onto the former star's driveway by coincidence, Joe's life takes one dark turn after another: and the film's look into career realism as well as its equally potent career naivety (even if the person it's coming from has more experience in real life). Norma is one of cinema's prettiest faces embodying the idea of tragedy and aged celebrity-status.Sunset Boulevard is the classically conceived kind of 'toxic valentine' that's inspired similar tales from Hollywood to exploit the many rewards and dangers of being blinded by show-business. It's film-noir that doesn't involve stealing an artifact or something: it's a film noir that comes from (and explores) the very medium where the genre began.

The crumbling Sunset Boulevard mansion where she lives with only her butler, Max who was once her director and husband has become her self-contained world. Norma dreams of a comeback to pictures and she begins a relationship with Joe Gillis, a small-time writer who becomes her lover, that will soon end with murder and total madness.I'm surprised by this film. I really am. I thought I wouldn't have liked this film but wow, was this a brilliant film. \"Sunset Blvd.\" plays like a satirical film noir, with hints of romance, comedy, thriller, suspense, horror, and surrealism, and yet, these things mix together perfectly on screen. It's kind of similar to \"Singin' in the Rain\" and \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane\" combined, with the whole faded famous actress who wants to come back on screen and the transition of the silent film era to films with audio, which is not a bad thing, really.The script is filled with impeccable and irresistible dialogue but, to no surprise, the one thing that makes this movie great, in the first place, is Gloria Swanson. At first, she may seem a melodramatic drama queen. Well, she is. However, as the movie progresses, you see her character becoming crazier and crazier, to a point, where, she's so crazy that she, herself, can't see that she's crazy. It's excellent! I don't know why she didn't win for an Oscar for Best Actress but she should have. I found her as a sympathetic villain, because we, the audience, know that she's a bit misunderstood. Her character becomes a faded movie star because of Hollywood leaving her behind in the silent film era. She has become stuck in the past that everyone else has moved on.William Holden does a well job, spending along side Swanson for most of the film. Erich von Stroheim, playing Swanson's butler, also does a fine job, and Nancy Olson does a fantastic job with hitting the marks with every scene she's in. The score by Franz Waxman was surprisingly great. I loved it. I should also give a shout out to the production and costume designers too. The black-and-white film noir cinematography, by John F. Seitz, creates some dramatic effects in some scenes.Overall, the film was nothing short of brilliant. Gloria Swanson, as the infamous Norma Desmond, is dazzling, along with the other three actors I've mentioned before. The script is just right for each scene and the end of the film is perfect.

            "content": "Billy Wilder had a long and much-honored career as a director. He made some of the best light comedies of his or any other era, but his best and most essential films pushed the boundaries of Hollywood at the time. From The Long Weekend's devastating look at the reality of alcoholism, to the frank discussion of changing societal norms in The Apartment, to making Holmes and Watson homosexual lovers in The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes, Wilder was always breaking new ground in what could be shown on the big screen.Sunset Blvd. may be his crowning achievement in boundary pushing, just because it is one of the most savage attacks on the mythos of Hollywood ever created. He spares no expense to bite the hands that feeds him, digging way deep beyond the glamor and into the reality of stars, former stars, and wannabes. The casting is dead-on, with Gloria Swanson and Ericj von Stroheim in particular--they had both been eaten up by the Hollywood system some time before 1950.Sunset Blvd's self-reflexive deconstruction of Hollywood myth would be enough by itself, but it's actually just one layer of many in a truly great film. It's also a fairly gripping detective story, downright funny in moments, and absolutely horrific in others--Swanson's famous \"I'm ready for my closeup, Mr. Demille\" in particular can still send shivers down your spine. Besides being one of the all-time great directors, Wilder was a hell of a writer who collaborated with some of the best screenwriters in the business; his long partnership with I.A.L. Diamond is legendary, but this is the last of 13 collaborations with Charles Brackett, who brought just the right amount of pathos and tragedy to the script, no doubt aided by his experience working behind the camera in Hollywood for years.If you are a film buff or a student of Golden Age Hollywood, you will likely add Sunset Blvd. to your list of all-time greatest movies, but you don't have to be a film student to enjoy it either. It's dramatic, funny, chilling, and really just a joy to watch unfold. Many great films of the late 1940s and early 1950s are still enjoyable to this day, but even the best of them can seem somewhat dated today. Not so with Sunset Blvd., which is as potent and stunning as it was in 1950. One of the all-time best films, Sunset Blvd. is highly recommended viewing.",

I must admit to never hearing of the late actress but she has an extensive silent-era filmography. It has elements of black comedy, a romantic element and a shocking noir like death.What I also liked about this picture was that real Hollywood people play themselves. Legends like Buster Keaton and director Cecil B.

Some of that nostalgia is captured in this movie and is in the background as well as theme of the movie. As far as the movie itself goes, it is a good story, well told and acted out to perfection. It presents an older woman using a younger man for her vain and selfish purposes and the man going along with it first out of necessity and later on like an insect in a spider's web. Stuck and no where to go with a hungry female prowling around. Nicely done on this point and the point of everyone coming to Hollywood to struggle until they got recognized for anything and start to make some real money.

Lastly, I got the chills watching this as I had a woman chasing me just like this one chased William Holden (no sex) offering me money, free lunches/dinners and gifts galore if I only devote myself to her. Mind you I am married but it didn't stop this obsessive person including her making me her heir. I even told her off (many times) and she would not let go. Creepy and dysfunctional to say the least. Enjoy this glimpse of real life back then but still happening today here and there and everywhere.... Come and visit ...",

            "content": "NOTE: The following is more of an essay than a review.Hollywood, the physical place, became the center of entertainment productions on a large scale through the use of moving photo frames to tell a story from circa 1910. Soundtracks began being added in 1928, the beginning of the so-called \"talkies\". (\"The Jazz Singer\" of 1927 was a hybrid of a silent/talking film.) Very soon, motion pictures (aka movies) became the most popular form of a relatively inexpensive entertainment until the advent of television in the 1940's.Almost from the get-go, the people producing the entertainments quickly realized they were creating a whole new culture. It was no longer just entertainment for entertainment's sake. Viewers began falling in love with some of the characters on screen. They sent letters to the actors and actresses. Some viewers believed that what they were seeing was real. Films became fantasies and the screens were like windows into another world.A large number of female viewers in the 1920's believed Rudolph Valentino was a great lover, even though no one outside of Hollywood knew he was gay. Clark Gable was thought to be a very masculine ladies' man, although he tended to be attracted to bossy dominant women. Betty Davis was thought to be a trouble-maker. John Wayne was believed to be a war hero, but never served for one day in the military. Edward G. Robinson was thought to be a gangster even though in real life he loved fine art and high literature. In other words, the Hollywood studios were also presenting fabrications of sorts.These fantasies provide the set-up for \"Sunset Boulevard\" directed and co-written by Billy Wilder. Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a down-on-his-luck mediocre screenwriter. His main flaw is that he gets too caught up in what he thinks will sell, rather than writing an honest story. Through a couple of strange coincidences he ends up at the manor house of a forgotten movie actress from the silent era, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her ever-loyal servant Max (Erich von Stroheim). She was one of the biggest stars of the silent era of the 1920's, playing in many epic films directed by Cecil B. Demille (who plays himself in the film). However, Hollywood has moved on and the demand for silent period pieces all but over, and she hasn't been cast in a feature film for 20 years.She's writing a bad screenplay based on Salome and she compels Gillis not to help her but reside in her manor. Norma's house appears like a movie set for a period picture taking place in the 19th century: velvet and satin upholstery on sofas, beds and drapery. She wears flowing garments and over-the-top makeup. She displayes dozens of photos of herself, as if her vanity is boundless. She is afterall a \"movie star\" in the old sense of the word, and she should be worshiped and adored. It seems more like a fantasy than a home which is I think the point the director and co-writer Billy Wilder wanted to convey.During the entire film, Norma Desmond seems to be engaged in over-the-top acting. Her interplay with Gillis is constantly melodramatic, as were many of the silent films prior to circa 1928. During the silent era, actors had to convey emotion through their expressions since there was no soundtrack. So by definition, their expressions had to be over-emphasized which seems highly melodramatic by the standards of today. So over and over again, Norma makes grand gestures and pierces Gillis with ever-growing bulging eyes.Her makeup is equally over-the-top, and she appears like a cross between the wicked queen of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and the Wicked Witch of the West. In several scenes we see her face on top of the screen as if she is the ruler of this strange queendom. She is like the wicked queen who has captured a prince. She lavishes him with expensive gifts but Gillis longs to be free of this gilded cage. The price of Gillis imprisonment is his own career. He briefly interacts with a young budding screenwriter, Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson) but he soon realizes he can't straddle both worlds forever. He has to make a choice between staying in the fantasy of Norma Desmond or returning to the real-world of film-making with Nancy.One of the noir masterpieces of the 20th century, and an indictment of Hollywood culture. Not necessarily for all tastes, the film is one of the first of its kind to openly critique Hollywood culture. Film actors, particularly actresses, were and still are in a way often treated like professional athletes. They are only as good as their last performances. After they've served their purpose and can no longer do so, they're discarded.",

            "content": "A dead man narrates Sunset Boulevard, eager to tell us his version of the events, the cold, hard facts, before they are distorted and blown out of proportion by the radio and television screen. Joe Gillis is a writer, and naturally wants his story to retain its integrity. Wilder gives us a witty snapshot of that idea disappearing in a puff of smoke early in the film, where Joe pitches his baseball script to an producer in a dinghy little office. Firstly it's openly mocked by a script reader (the demure yet snappy Nancy Olson) who wants something grandiose and with a message. \"You'd have turned down Gone with the Wind!\" splutters Joe in exasperation. \"No, that was me,\" remarks the producer with resignation. Almost absent-mindedly whilst lounging on the couch, he twists Joe's story into an all-female spectacle with musical interludes, with the screen credit the only remaining vestige of the initial premise. And when Joe pleas for a personal loan, he launches into a spiel about his own spiralling debts that Wilder quickly cuts away from. There's no need for semantics; he's hemorrhaging money, like most of Hollywood, where original ideas are sparse and basic plots are organised by numbers and letters. Joe is played by William Holden, the strapping lead who would go on to star in other blockbusters like The Bridge on the River Kwai and Stalag 17, and who almost allows the audience to forget he is playing the everyman figure in this film, a struggling writer who has exchanged talent for a living. Wilder's dialogue is as biting and cynical as it ever is, delivered from the mouthpieces of two who have been spun around by Hollywood's washing cycle and spit out as nobodies. Joe holds himself up high, whether it is in a shabby blazer or a dinner suit and bow tie, but he has already traded away his artistic integrity. What more is a little self-respect? While he turns his nose at the array of baubles and trinkets that Norma showers him with, it's also a little flattering. His steely gaze hides a begrudging reliance, as does Norma's histrionics, betraying a twisted partnership; they need each other. Both Boulevard and Double Indemnity were photographed by John F. Seitz, who Wilder had entrusted with the latter's moody, noir lighting, and recruited to recapture. The term is French for black, and in a sense they were black both morally and physically. Seitz uses the same technique he did in Indemnity by sprinkling aluminium dust in front of the lens to render the sprawling, gothic mansion of Norma's into a dusty ruin, of luxury in decay. As Joe and Betty collaborate on their script late at night in a discreet motel (practically a synonym for seediness), he keeps the latter in the catch light, an angelic casualty of the wicked world of showbiz, but submerges Holden's face in shadow, like the very nature of his thoughts were being divulged. The guilt of their covert affair consumes him, as if he was in sole ownership of Norma Desmond. Who else but Gloria Swanson could have captured this performance? Norma's demise mirrors Swanson's, once a glittering silent icon, for 6 years the top star of Paramount, and then scuttled by the arrival of sound. The role asks for quiet desperation to be masked by flamboyance, and Norma replies in kind. She is a relic of the past, her costumes elaborate but dated, her poise a touch theatrical, but if she doesn't believe it, it might as well not be true. \"I can say anything I want with my eyes,\" she declares, and sure enough, her pupils bore holes in any eyes who dare meet them, and makes demands, not queries. Cut away from her? Not likely. Norma still believes she commands the screen, and in some respects she does, most evidently in that final trance, where she fully commits to the illusion that has been held up for the last twenty years. But for Joe's brief peek into the enigma that is Norma Desmond, she has been long swallowed by Sunset Boulevard.",

            "content": "In an age when cinema generally succumbed to the tropes and clich\u00e9s to which audiences were mechanically accustomed as a means for quicker cash, what better way to set the precedent of new and original storytelling as an art form than Billy Wilder's introduction to the 1950s, Sunset Boulevard - a film that explores excitingly unfamiliar territory while simultaneously presenting itself as a meta commentary of such transformation in the motion picture industry. A master of genre versatility, Wilder makes significant alterations to film noir with the addition of a light comedic backdrop, still managing to close on a note of poignancy that lingers in the mind, cementing the film as a landmark in movie history.We know immediately that we are in for something unusual for the era as the protagonist, Joe Gillis (William Holden), appears to be narrating from beyond the grave, the accompanying image containing the silhouette of Joe's floating corpse in a swimming pool. As police arrive on the scene, the rest unfolds through flashback explaining the events that led to our hero's demise. Going back to the start, we learn that Joe is a Hollywood screenwriter struggling to succeed in the dying business. After establishing his desperation as he is unable to sell his most recent script or persuade his friends to loan him money, matters get worse as he is chased by repossession men. One of his tires blows out, and he makes the quickest turn into the garage of a deserted mansion on Sunset Blvd. There he meets Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a long-forgotten silent film star who is determined to make a triumphant return to the screen with a project she has written herself. When made aware of his experience, she hires Joe as an editor. Her butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim), puts him up in the guest room for the duration of his stay, ultimately extending much longer than he had anticipated. Thus begins a gradual obsession that deteriorates Norma's sanity, and Joe may be in too deep to find a way out.Wilder, along with Charles Brackett and D.M. Marshman Jr., provides the film's most extraordinary facet in his ingeniously crafted screenplay, earning a well-deserved Academy Award. It achieves thorough effect in blending tones, revealing twists and building conflict of all sorts. Even more impressive is the sharp wit and humor of the dialogue, giving the material infinitely more enjoyment than generic Hollywood output lacking any personality. It also fascinatingly utilizes subtle hints of symbolism and movie references, further improving the experience for film buffs in more way than one. His direction is also expectedly very good, bringing the content to life with skillfully constructed imagery and smooth editing work that flows sufficiently. A detractor from the impact, however, is the conventional use of music that hits every note one would expect at every moment they'd expect it. This is a technical aspect that is vital in evoking the right viewer reaction and unfortunately it does not always do so, making it the main attribute in which Sunset Boulevard resembles the majority of other works of its time. Even still, the positive certainly outweighs the negative as the great ensemble helps to carry the film, and is one of the very few to garner Oscar nominations in each acting category. Holden is a slick and likable leading man as always, while making Joe a sympathetic man with an internal battle as he must decide between rational logic and his heart. The love interest whom Joe desires is played by Nancy Olson, who does an adequate job of creating natural chemistry with Holden, though it may be slightly rushed and lacking emotional investment. Also intriguing is von Stroheim as the mysterious butler whose past with Norma may consist of more than meets the eye. This leads us to the one creation that drove the film beyond mere acclaim and is primarily responsible for the reason Sunset Boulevard is regarded as an all-time classic.The characterization of the deliciously psychotic Norma Desmond is absolutely brilliant, as Swanson's Oscar-nominated portrayal seamlessly conveys a woman who believably achieved fame long ago and is now stuck in denial that it ever disappeared. Joe recalls that she \"used to be big\", to which she replies with a disdaining tone, \"I am big. It's the pictures that got small.\" If ever there was a performance that should truly feel like a performance, it is this one. Norma is a forever doomed actress who cannot escape the theatrics of a lively, expression-based movie star, and therefore her delivery of each line and movement is pervaded by a larger-than-life air of grandiose. Not only does this make for a highly interesting character to observe, but also often infuses her presence with hilarity and delight as she permeates every situation with unnecessary dramatics that come to be rather predictable. That is, until her mental instability spirals into a maniacal state, leading to a drastic climax followed by the iconic ending scene in which she deliriously makes her way into the spotlight for the cameras one last time, telling the hallucinatory director: \"All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.\" The film is not quite the masterpiece it is hailed to be, but it deserves immense appreciation for its sheer braveness and creativity. It indeed holds all the essential ingredients of a classic, with memorable moments that now inarguably contribute to defining the medium as a whole. A sense of freshness also separates it from the pack, and it is both entertaining and thought-provoking enough to warrant multiple revisits. Most importantly, the character of Norma Desmond and the conclusion to which her story comes is unforgettable, the finale inducing a sensation that deceives the softness of the film's earlier atmosphere and instead leaves us on a note that is all at once tragic, disturbing and darkly funny. Overall, Sunset Boulevard is a crucial part of cinema that is essential viewing for any film-goer.",

            "content": "From the opening of the dead body in the swimming pool to the last shot of a fuzzy Gloria Swanson, it is mesmerizing. The casting is brilliant. First, Gloria Swanson, a famous silent movie actress, was picked to play the insane and creepy Norma. While Swason herself wasn't like the character herself, she understood her situation so completely that despite the character's hugeness. Even though everything is overexaturated, you see that it is done because of the character's background, a silent movie actor had to act larger than life so that there emotions were conveyed, Norma can't distinguish anything in her life anymore. Swason was able to make the character real. William Holden was having a slump at the time after Golden Boy. He mixed the right amount of sex appeal and cynicism in the role to make it perfect. Erik Von Stroheim, the failed director, was basically playing himself in many ways. His career went down the drain after a failed movie with Gloria Swanson called Queen Kelly. He was the perfect pick for the role and made the character. Nancy Olsen is exactly what she is supposed to be, a fresh face that brings the only heart to the movie. The basic story is a failed writer named Joe hides his car from the repo men in what he thinks is an abandoned house. Norma, a formerly famous actress from the twenties, brings him in because she thinks he is there is bring the coffin for her dead chimp. She keeps him there to rewrite her putrid script called Salome and gradually turns him into her new chimp all the time abetted by her exhusaband, discoverer, butler named max. He becomes a kept man a sexual plaything. He trys to leave, but she attempts suicide and he stays. As her starts to hate himself more, he starts to sneak away to write a screenplay with young Betty Schaefer and falls in love with her. Norma then finds the screenplay, Untitled Love Story and starts to call Betty. Joe overhears and tells Betty to come to the house, tells her what he is and then sends her away. Joe then tries to leave Norma, but she shoots him and he falls into the pool. At this point Norma has completely gone off the deep end and goes down the stairs when police are there thinking that the newsreel cameras are movie cameras filming Salome. As much as this film is about how Hollywood is an awful place, you can still see that there is a love for film in it. Betty and her work with Joe on the screenplay is all sweet, careful and done with love. Norma herself shows love for film, despite how demented she is the final monologue shows a genuine appreciation for film. It shows how the business destroys the film making, but still appreciates it as an art.",

The forgotten movie star living in a dilapidated, spooky mansion off Sunset Blvd. is a terrific setting. Great casting abounds with Gloria Swanson and hottie William Holden, and the strange friends each of them have. But for me, this movie falls apart every time they pull away from Gloria to concentrate on Joe and Betty's budding romance. Why devote so much screen time to a bland character, Betty Schaefer, struggling to write a who cares script called \"Dark Windows\" or whatever it's called, when we could be spending more time with faded, kooky Norma Desmond in her scary house with Max? Face it, no body writes volumes about Nancy Olson's character do they? We all know who makes this movie great, and it ain't her. The only fun scene with Betty is when Norma (surprise!) is tracking her down on the phone. I know Betty must provide a jealous factor for Norma, but her character could have been so easily pushed into the background, way into the background, and still have a suspicious Norma think that Joe is cheating on her.

            "content": "Not quite the shocker it was in 1950, \"Sunset Blvd.\" still packs a wallop. For most director/writers \"Sunset Blvd.\" would have been the height of their careers, their masterpiece, but for multi-talented Billy Wilder there were better pictures. \"Double indemnity,\" \"The Apartment,\" \"Some Like It Hot,\" and two highly underrated films \"Ace in the Hole\" and \"One, Two, Three\" are better written than \"Sunset Blvd.\" Take off the tinsel and the viewer will find some cracks in \"Sunset Blvd.\" One distraction is the narration by the body floating in the swimming pool. There's a clich\u00e9 that dead men tell no tales. Well, a dead man tells one hell of a tale in this film. The movie takes forever to get to the essence of the story. It gets better and better as the movie progresses until it explodes at the end. The best scene in the whole film is the last scene when Norma Desmond gives what amounts to a soliloquy for the newsreel cameras. Some critics have labeled this a dark comedy. There is really not much that is funny in the film. Calling it a dark melodrama is more apropos. \"Dr. Strangelove\" is a dark comedy. Dark comedies make a person laugh at subject matter such as death and weapons of mass destruction that would ordinarily be taken very seriously. A good dark comedy also makes one think. \"A Modest Proposal\" by Jonathan Swift is an example of dark comedy at its highest level. Though \"Sunset Blvd.\" certainly makes the viewer think, its punch comes from the drama of contradiction and social analysis, not in its humor.The film has a few other weaknesses but let's look at the tinsel. What tinsel! All the actors give magnificent performances. The best among the great is Erich von Stroheim. It's easy to forget what a wonderful actor von Stroheim was until one sees him in action. It is also rewarding to see Jack Webb in a non-tough cop or punk hood role. One forgets that he was a serious actor before \"Dragnet\" stereotyped him. William Holden gives one of his best screen performances. Gloria Swanson is just whom Wilder needed to pull off the extraordinary acting required for her role, plus she was the real McCoy so one of her silent films could actually be used to intensify the allegory. One of the best lines in the film is delivered by Cecil B. DeMille. He has pampered Norma, telling her what she wants to hear. But as she is leaving and out of earshot, he reverts to his true attitude toward the faded screen goddess. \"Tell Gordon Cole to forget about the car. I'll buy him another, or even five if he likes.\" In the viewer's mind DeMille is talking about Norma, not cars. To my knowledge this is the first Hollywood film to deal seriously with the subject of Narcissism in the industry. Narcissism applies to Thespians but also to any person in a position of power. Narcissistic personalities simply cannot deal with life outside the limelight. They must have mass adoration at any price. If you haven't seen \"Sunset Blvd.\" by all means watch it and form your own conclusion. It is certainly one of Wilder's best.",

A struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis(William Holden) starts living with an old star of the silent era Norma Desmond(Gloria Swanson) in order to write a screenplay for a movie she wants to act in(which is supposed to be her big comeback). Joe is amused by Norma's behaviour. She still lives in an illusory world in her mansion where she is still a big star. Her faithful servant Max Von Mayerling also feeds her ego and keeps telling her that she is a big star. Norma begins falling in love with Joe and gives him presents in order to keep him. The movie then follows Norma's degeneration and the final over the top conclusion. The situation of old actresses who were stars in the past is very well portrayed in this movie. The dry humour and sarcasm in this movie is also an aspect that raises it above the other classics of the Old Hollywood era. It can also be seen as a satire of the Hollywood system. The scene where the director tells his assistants not to call her again - the same director who had once promoted her heavily - is a sad scene which shows the fleeting nature of showbiz. The portrayal of Norma's obsession with Joe is also excellent. The way Joe gillis uses the opportunity to his own advantage is also quite funny in a sad depressing way.The attitudes of the people reveal a somewhat dated attitude that doesn't quite fit in today. The scene in the shop where the shopkeeper says \"Well, as long as the lady's paying for it, why not take the vicu\u00f1a?\" shows a somewhat derisive attitude towards a woman having a \"trophy man\"(while the opposite has been accepted). The attitude of Joe Gillis also seems dated. He behaves as if he is embarrassed that an older woman is interested in him. The line \"I had to be with people my own age.\" shows the derisive attitude he has towards Norma's love towards him. I felt that the movie was a bit behind the times in these aspects. The ending was also a bit too over the top for my liking.The performances are top notch. The laidback acting style of William Holden is complemented by the over the top performance of Gloria Swanson. The over the top performance was appropriate in this movie, I guess. In many scenes she even seemed cute when she proclaims that she is one of the biggest stars. There is a likability to her character even though she seems a bit unhinged throughout. Nancy Olson is gorgeous and she is adequate for the role. Erich Von stroheim is very good as the faithful servant Max and it is surprising to note that he wasn't a professional actor while doing this film. Cecil de mille's cameo is actually quite good.I liked the movie but felt that the movie seemed a bit too dated for my taste. It can be taken as a stinging critique of Hollywood that is relevant even now. The dated aspects prevent it from becoming a great movie though.7/10",

This picture is about a person so devoted to her own self she didn't see the years go by, she didn't want to; she lived in the past absorbed by her days of glory and the only thing she needed was adoration. That's what she found in a young man's soul who came to her house by mistake: fate brought them together but instead of giving her what she longs for he uses her wealth to gain his own profit out of the poor woman's heart and her troubled mind. \"Sunset blvd\" is not only a street, it's also a place where dreams crash, where hearts break, people suffer and literally anything can happen.Mr Wilder's masterful script and directing, covered in the most beautiful score by Franz Waxman (undoubtedly his best work for which he received an Academy Award) and peppered by the most outstanding performances by the silent movie star Gloria Swanson who got to shine brightest again as well as the silent movie director/actor Erich von Stroheim and splendid work of the talented William Holden that altogether made this motion picture one of the most brilliant movies ever.",

DeMille to direct but had a terrible script. The film was suspenseful because we want to know why she was really that crazy, but her performance was still well done thanks to memorable lines, for example the most selfish line in the movie in the beginning where she says to Joe Gillis in her bedroom \"I am big, it's the pictures that got small, and the last line in the movie which is the most memorable line in the movie when she was filming in her house and the last line \"All right Mr. DeMille I'm ready for my closeup.\". When Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett wrote the screenplay they wanted a frightening look at Hollywood like no other film director has done before. Not only do William Holden and Gloria Swanson have good performances but so does Eric Von Stroheim as her first husband and Desmond's butler. This is one o those movies that really deserved best picture but didn't win. I had no problems at all with this film, but I personally don't get why Alfred Hitchcock didn't direct this movie in the first place?",

That is the story of Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis, one who has reached the pinnacle of success in Hollywood, only to have to have lost her youth and beauty and forgotten; and another who is struggling at the bottom to make it and will do just about anything to achieve that.That parallel is what makes this movie so genius.  Norma Desmond is one of the great characters in cinematic history, and Gloria Swanson does a phenomenal job portraying her.  I had only seen Gloria in silent films previous to this, and was doubtful of her \"speaking\" abilities, but she just absolutely nails this role.  I cannot imagine anyone who could have done this better than her.  Especially that end scene, where she does that eerie dance down the stairs and raises her eyebrows and walks into the camera. Absolutely Fantastic!Although William Holden was amazing, I kinda would have liked to have seen how Montgomery Clift would have pulled it off.  I think what was appealing about Monty was that sensitivity and vulnerability he portrayed, and I think that would have worked very well in this role.Other than that, the casting was perfect.  Erich von Stronheim was excellent, and what is scary is that he used to be a up and coming director in the 20s.  Nancy Olson had that innocent, wholesome look that was perfect for Betty, the only character in this movie that gives this industry any redemption.  For that reason alone, I would have given her the oscar over Josephine Hull.I know that Billy Wilder was one of the people who wrote this script, and if he came up with that line, \"I'm still big, it's the pictures that got small,\" on top of his direction of this movie, he is absolute genius.One of the ten greatest movies ever made.",

            "content": "I would like to preface this review by stating I fully realize that as a person of the contemporary times my conception of pace and story development certainly conditions me to favoring a swifter more fluid progression in a film's plot. So older films will often tend to feel a bit slow. But then again \"It's a Wonderful Life\" is one of the top films I've ever seen despite being 5 years younger than this and about 20 minutes longer, so the point here is there's no excuse for something perceived as a flaw, not its time not anything.During some stretches the film will lack a bit of content and could've been filled with more intricacy when the narrative is clear enough to the viewer. All in all, it's obvious what the director is conveying during each section from the very start of the scene, it appears the film could've benefited from perhaps 15min less with more effective playtime. The conclusion also leaves something to be desired and contributes largely to that notion of being too self-explanatory and a scene which point is too obvious from the start. The Norma Desmond character is probably overplayed a tad (especially towards the end), which further contributes to that obviousness factor and pushes the movie towards looking like a movie rather than genuine and subtle.Of course it's still a very good film - especially if compared with the films of today it feels like a masterpiece of rare occurrence. It's strong in plot, psychologically intriguing and well crafted with several interesting developments (rather than feeding off one single idea) and the narration is just superb for about the two thirds of it before dropping to a more normal level in the last part.7.5/10.",

            "content": "The most admirable thing about this Billy Wilder masterpiece is the courage it took to make this film. 1950 is exactly in the middle between the self-imposed production code and the anti-American pogroms. In that narrow window comes this scathing satire of Hollywood glam in the same year as All About Eve. Both 1950s are an indictment of the soulless packaging of the movie business. Both take the point of view of the ambitions and the frustrations of leading ladies that lived long enough to witness their fading. Both were nominated for best film. All About Eve, perhaps because it was more direct and less metaphorical about its subject manner, won the day. It is no doubt a good film but today we recognise Sunset as the superior work.Many people play themselves in this film. Buster Keaton leads a team of vaguely recognisable 'wax works' whose wrinkling bodies are dying monuments to their glamorous silent movie pasts. C.B. de Mille plays himself as a survivor that transcended the transformation of the movie business.But Gloria Swanson and Erich von Stroheim are also playing themselves in this roman-a-clef where all their change about this autobiographical performance is their names.Gloria Swanson was Norma Desmond: in shared historical experience if not in personality traits. She had been a great star of the silent movies, her face known and admired world-wide. A 17 year old girl 'discovered' by Hollywood, placed on the front row of a joy ride into fame and fortune, only to be discarded when the pictures 'became too small' for her to fit in. That phrase is how she is introduced to us. William Holden's Joe Gillis vaguely recognises the dark dame in her desolate temple. 'You're Norma Desmond. You used to be big.' 'I'm still big,' comes to retort, 'it's the pictures that become small.' The butler in this palace of regret and memory is Max played by von Stroheim. Half way through the film, when in an exposition scene the history of the relationship between butler and dame becomes clearer to us, Max tells us there were three young directors in the early days of Hollywood that showed much promise: D.W. Griffith, C.B. de Mille and himself, the butler. If he said the third man was the actor who played the butler he'd have been perfectly accurate.Have-beens are a fact of life in every industry but there is, or at least should be an inherent sadness, in the cynicms of an E! special about one-hit-wonders or what ever happened to that forgotten child-star. Gloria Swanson and Better Davies (in the other 1950 Hollywood-themed movie) are representative of what must happen all the time. That in itself is no bad news. I suppose cabin crew, athletes or whoever else relies on their appearance for their living all have the inevitably early sunset ahead of them in their minds.What is particular about the movies is that persons - their appearance and more importantly their capacity to incarnate in their acting the emotions and ambitions of those who watch them - are packaged as a product that is valuable only while it waits for the next best thing.That's the theme of the film. Consider now its quality. The movie uses the device of a narrator but with the knowledge, revealed very early in the film, that our narrator has died a few hours ago and he only exists because we need to be put in the picture of understanding why he is dead.We also need to understand how he came about to meet this one particular end. He's floating, face down, in the swimming pool of a huge mansion on Sunset Boulevard. And the curiosity is awakened by the odd perspective with which we see the corpse, looking up at its face from the bottom of the pool.This is the particularity of the cinema, which allow us to look and see from corners and angles impossible in the physical world. But cinema is the subject of this film. Consider now therefore the concluding scene as Norma walks down the staircase of what is physically her house from which she is to be taken away but in his mind is the set of C.B. de Mille's great new production starring her.First we see the cameras. They are newsreels hungrily shooting this new juicy scandal. But Norma wants to believe they are C.B. de Mille's cameras. 'I'm ready for my close-up now Mr. de Mille.' And she looks straight in our eyes as she addresses us who are guilty of her tragic existence. It was our hunger for glamour and success that thrust upon her the role of a star. As our boredom as an audience sets in and we switch to younger stars she is left knowing nothing better but her need for attention.It is that odd relationship between stars and audiences that Billy Wilder sets up for us in Sunset Blvd. This is not a one-way affair and when we abandon our stars, they have a right to feel betrayed. We should not be surprised that artists whose function is to magnify several times over human emotions (this is especially true of the silent pictures) deal with this betrayal with this sort of drama. Who has a better right to be a drama queen than a professional drama queen?",

Where, a man or woman wants to redeem their career or try hard to look younger or anything like that. To name a few, I get \"American Beauty\" and that woman in \"Requiem for a Dream\" in my mind. Where people want to go back to their younger days and just want to start again. Now, this not just the story of a woman trying to get young, it's also about a man who wants to make his career. It begins with this man, accidentally driving into this woman's mansion and just trying to act as a busy man. Now, as many other Billy Wilder movies, it starts as an accident that happens between two people, here it's between this writer and a middle aged woman. Now, that is where the film takes on, and that is the what gets us interested. This movie has a fine performance by Joe (William Holden) and other actors but it is Norma Desmond (played by Gloria Swanson) that this film belongs to and wow, she has made it her own by bringing a certain kind of wicked insanity that is rare even in today. Yes, many have tried to emulate this kind of wicked emotion as done by Swanson, but I believe she was just great at it. And hey, Gloria Swanson played out an near autobiographical role here as she had worked with Cecil DeMille in those silent pictures in true life and played that very character who just wants to get back to cameras. Wow, Billy Wilder has got the right woman as Norma Desmond.You have to watch this movie for more than one reason, it is believable, intriguing and yes it has a kind of suspense that will make us sit and see who is that man and what he is up to?. The protagonist here is not that lady though, it's the man and this is his story. The writing is simple yet great and each scene is lit well and shot well so cinematography is good in here. The audio, yes it's mostly dialogue with the big background suspenseful score filling a few gaps, music is good too. Having said all that, it's not my kind of drama and it is not my favourite yet. Though, I give it 4/5, I am not sure if I am going to sit through this movie one more time.",

Norma is portrayed more like an older, wealthy, eccentric, former movie star that just can't let go of her dream of being forever young, forever loved and forever a relevant star. Because her illness goes unrecognized and therefore untreated, she carries out a horrific act at the end and then we get to see the full extent of her illness as she enters the realm of nonreality and pretends to be back in the studio being filmed. Just really sad that in 1950, this was how they viewed mental illness - just eccentric people who didn't quite think and act like everyone else.",

Norma has all the money in the world, yet it can't buy her happiness...and that's a lesson she learns the hard way.  Swanson plays this character so amazingly--I could not imagine any other actress (not even any of the better known \"great\" actresses) playing this character.  Swanson had a certain presence, an exotic quality, a radiance--something that suits this eccentric character perfectly.  She just shines throughout the whole movie.  I especially like the chemistry between Swanson and Holden.  Plus, Von Stroheim is impressive as Swanson's butler.  Their performances are what make this film great....them and the remarkable cinematography.  A great film, though it's not the best film of 1950.  Still, it's a true classic.

Focusing on how fame is ephemera and that, no matter how famous you are, you will soon be forgotten and replaced by others that will, sooner or later, also be forgotten.It also focuses on the refusal to accept that the past will never come back and how we can live in a complete delusion fueled by our lack of acceptance.Furthermore, Gloria Swanson's performance is superb and legendary.It's also unusual to have a story narrated by a dead man and even less in 1950...To sum up, this is definitely a timeless movie and of the must-watch classics.",

            "content": "Sunset Boulevard is like a job-shadow for youngsters with some interest or talent for screen writing, without having connections to people in the industry. It depicts the highs, but mostly lows of screen writing in Hollywood: work and pay is inconsistent, inspiration hits only at certain times, and if personal matters become entangled in work, say goodbye to any semblance of the quality in your writing. Though Hollywood's changed since the times of Sunset Boulevard, the studio-dominated world back then, some things never change. It doesn't discourage screenwriters from tapping into their full potential, rather gives them a look at the back dealings of Hollywood, and no matter when the time, writers must always confront Hollywood's past so they can determine the future. The staggering success of Sunset Boulevard's production is the screenplay; it's a clever script showing a vision of Hollywood. While it's obviously overdrawn and exaggerated with its realism, it's a semi-believable look at a new face of Hollywood rising above the old. Sunset Boulevard is especially fun for people who enthusiastically get involved in the world of movies because of the added \"industry humor\". It's the things that film critics and movie lovers say to our friends or think in our minds about movies. Maybe Sunset Boulevard was made for the people behind the guilds in the film business. It can be viewed as a reflection and lead to psychological mysteries of people vs. things . That concept differs from the average American and movie affiliated professionals. But through all the finger-pointing Sunset Boulevard does at Hollywood, it celebrates how important it is.A lot of ideas float around in Sunset Boulevard, as well as a lot of artistic pride being boasted on the screen. The most overwhelming and fairly obvious positive trait of the film is the extravagant art direction; the monumental sets make the story already interesting even before we know what's going on in the first scene at the mansion. The costumes are gaudy, too. The film is quite funny in places making the ride a joyous one at times, and an eerie at others. It's well balanced and never bores its viewer with one point that it's working towards. Sunset Boulevard's use of narration works effectively, here, and is a crucial part of the film. The two leads work supporting the film to make it stand on its two feet. William Holden's smooth, realistic view of a screenwriter actually is superior to Glory Swanson's approach to her unique character. In a role that reminded me of ironic characters, Swanson didn't quite hit the perfect levels of intensity that have been established in other films such as All About Eve or Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?Sunset Boulevard doesn't try to be Atlantic deep, but it successfully comments on \"Old Hollywood\" and led me to think about things that never crossed my mind before. I think we as a society underestimate celebrity levels of loneliness. The media is always buzzing for something new, well what happens to the person behind the star who has built their lives on something, just to be discarded for something \"new\"? It's almost tragic, shown through a tragic character. Hollywood is a disillusionment, though they may be more financially stable than some, the occupants are still people with complex feelings and triggers. I was unsure how much I actually liked Sunset Boulevard, even up to the final scene, I couldn't decide whether it exceeded its reputation or finished below it. Then that final shot came. It all hit me with Gloria Swanson fading into darkness just what this film accomplished and how it touched me. My favorite thing about Sunset Boulevard is the irony that its characters are talking about the disgust they feel towards dialogue. Little do they know, the dialogue and writing is the thing that separates it from the crowd. Rating: 9/10Grade: A",

The ending shows you just how far she will go and it leaves some haunting thoughts in your head after you watch it. On the other hand though, I did feel that it was a little bit unneeded at first. I didn't feel like it was too necessary but that thought died off quickly.Joe Gillis is a character that we kind of feel sorry for. He stumbles upon her house on accident and he starts to feel that he's stuck at her house. You really can't spoil the ending since it is revealed to us how the film ends at the beginning but it makes us feel sad for what happens to Joe because he was almost able to go back to his old life. However, I can understand why the movie would choose to end like that because it makes it more clear what its message is and it explains to us more about the meaning behind the movie.The film's instrumental soundtrack is neither amazing nor bad. It just serves as a catchy soundtrack and it doesn't expand too much more than that. It isn't that impressive but I didn't notice it to be a distraction so I can't say that it diminished the movie's quality in any way.The acting is great on all parts. Gloria Swanson plays a once popular silent film star who suffers from depression and has made several suicide attempts in the past. Her acting doesn't get too amazing until the final few minutes where she is able to convey several mods at once. However, she does a thoroughly convincing role throughout the movie. William Holden's acting remains above average throughout the film. I can't say that he had a moment which truly stood out from the rest but he is still able to convey an ensnared man who is trying to keep the reality of her fame a secret pretty well. He did a good job also.For some reason, the most common complaint I seem to have about a movie is that it will have slow pacing which can bring me out of a movie to a varying degree and it can play a part in whether I'd want to watch it again. The issue I have with this movie is its talk-heavy dialogue. Some may not mind this but I grew eager for the movie to pick up its pace several times in the movie. Some movies are able to get around this issue though like \"Russian Ark\". Although it had slow pacing, it interested me because I love history and art. Also, it had superb cinematography and lighting. Some movies are successfully able to get around this problem. However, I lost much of my attention near the middle of the film because it did not provide a way to make me not mind its slow pace.Despite the slow pacing though, this movie provides a great look on Hollywood and it can be surprisingly pretty upsetting at the ending (in a good way). I can understand why many consider this to be a masterpiece and I can see why it would be considered to be one of the greatest movies ever. It is a great movie, but it could have been much better if the pacing made it an easier film to watch and enjoy. Despite this though, it's still a great movie which has a lot going for it and it is a must-see if you're trying to catch up on classic works of cinema.",

The crazed Norma Desmond has got to be one of the most bizarre and memorable characters in all of cinema, and Swanson really made it all happen. The story leaves something to be desired, even if it is well-written, as there's not a whole lot happening, and the acting, while good, never even comes close to Swanson's performance. That may be more due to Swanson than the others, but no one else really impressed. Certainly not all Oscar-calibre performances, as all of the main four were nominated. The direction is solid but not really impressive - I only got a sense of the bizarre through Swanson's performance, not the direction - and the jabs at Hollywood, while humorous, are pretty tame. Still, a memorable flick, though not one of the best of all time.",

It may be hard for some to understand as it was released in 1950 but it is great nevertheless. It perfectly melds the noir genre with the general populous' interest in the stars. Unlike other movies at the time this film truly showed the dark side of Hollywood. The side filled with murder, affairs, and shady actions. It showcased how fame can mess with a person. Considering it was shot when it was it had some amazing angles. One of my favourites was the classic scene of Joe Gillis floating in the pool. This film also showcased a tremendous amount of symbolism. In almost every scene it was there it seemed. From Joe's chain getting caught on the gate to Norma Desmond getting hit by a boom microphone. It added a whole new layer. This was a very enjoyable film and although it was not one of my favourites, I am glad that I have seen it as it is referenced a lot in film today.

Everything in reality is crushed into pieces, so the memory stays in that gilded era.The movie focuses on the actor Joe. The viewer enters the movie through Joe's guidance and becomes the main body of the story. The movie uses Joe's narration to expand the narrative, intending to distance the viewer from the movie characters. Refusal of the viewer 's participation.Joe's opening narration, like the typical plot of the suspense film, foreshadowed the end of Joe's death and set the sky full of suspense.As the second-rate Hollywood screenwriter Joe, he accidentally broke into a desolate and strange mansion during his escape, and because of a mysterious misidentification, he never came out of the puzzle.When he ran away in the middle of the night, the heroine Norma shot at him. When he shot the first shot, he shuddered, and still stubbornly moved forward. The shot hit the second shot. He did n't make it until the third shot. Slammed into the water vertically and died in the old swimming pool.This swimming pool has appeared at least five times in the entire movie, each time with a heavy pen-at the moment when the only living creature ran through, at the moment when Joe was swimming, at the moment when Betty watched, and at the opening and ending At that moment, the moment when countless flashes focused.In the mysterious building of this old Hollywood mansion, there are endless drinks and money, but here is lonely, lonely, alienated, marginal, exclusive, here there is only one man and one woman, guarding Shaky dreams.Norma has lived in the glory of the past from beginning to end, never waking up, Max has achieved her greatness with one hand, and has dug a coffin for her. When the lights of the set hit Norma's pampering face, the cheers after another led her back to the peak. At that moment, her appearance in the movie made an annotation for Du Qing's \"Qinghui Jade Arm Cold\".When the film freezes on Norma's distorted face at the last moment, her mad and taunting eyes squint at the camera, as if proclaiming to the audience, \"I am the king of the world\". This very dramatic scene scheduling makes people use it subconsciously Hand blocking.Norma's split is a true portrayal of many of us, but we refuse to admit that we are only seeking alternative satisfaction in art and awakening that lost golden moment in fiction.There are actually a lot of things to say about this excellent noir film, but let 's stop here. Finally, I will mention the lines of the movie, which is really wonderful and amazing.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder, born in Austria-Hungary built himself a huge reputation during 1940's-60's in Hollywood. He's is best known for his comedies with Marilyn Monroe (Some Like It Hot, The Seven Year Itch), but his other films haven't remained in the shadows either. In 1944 he directed his film-noir masterpiece Double Indemnity, which became a big inspiration for many directors. In addition to these films Billy Wilder's trade mark is probably his own unique satire, best seen in One Two Three!, A Foreign Affair and of course in Sunset Blvd. In 1950 Billy Wilder was already at the top of his career, he produced his films himself and therefore had much more artistic freedom. This freedom allowed him to make a different kind of film with the screenwriter, Charles Brackett. Sunset Blvd. was no one night wonder, it took two years to finish it and the most time went to the writing. Brackett has told that someone suggested that they should make a film about a forgotten silent-era actress, who meets a desperate writer. They casted Gloria Swanson (who actually was one of the biggest silent-era starts) to play the role of Norma Desmond, a forgotten star.Sunset Boulevard is the second longest highway in Los Angeles, it reaches from the central station to the shore of the ocean. The boulevard entails more different modes of life than any other street in the world, the life around it is temporary; small stores, singles without families and motels. It's the street full of television and radio studios. The sunset is also the boulevard of cinema fame. This milieu of the film is very important to understand while watching Sunset Blvd.Sunset Boulevard, the film and the actual boulevard, mean traveling back in both time and place. It passes by the historical Hollywood, but the new modern Hollywood is also built around it. It's a historical journey to cinema. One could easily call Sunset Blvd. the best film ever made in Hollywood, it is a true \"Hollywood Story.\" It's a modern tragedy, that follows the genre film-noir. It is very interesting from many perspectives, it's a cruel film about a cruel industry. It's a satirical description of Hollywood.Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a desperate writer trying to get a job, the films he has written the stories for have never been that successful. One day people from the debt collection agency come to take his car. While hiding away from them Joe randomly parks his car next to an old mansion, which seems deserted. It doesn't take long for him to realize that it's actually the home of Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), a forgotten silent film actress. Norma hasn't been acting in 20 years and thinks that it is the time for her big 'comeback', so with the help of Joe she decides to write a screenplay for herself. The more Joe gets to know Norma the more he becomes aware that she is still living in the past.This is a story about two desperate people; Joe is desperately trying to get work, he has one sad relationship with a girl, which of course leads nowhere. Norma still thinks she is the biggest star in Hollywood, she still gets hundreds of fan letter each day - actually sent by her butler. The mansion is full of memories, full of her photos and there's even a film theater for her, which only shows films she acted in. Once a week Norma goes to play bridge with her friends, who all are old silent-film actors - also played by themselves; Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson and H.B. Warner. Joe operatively names this group, the wax museum. When Norma falls in love with Joe, troubles start to occur. Norma seems to be a very suicidal person, she is very depressed, yearning for attention and admiration. This she can get from Joe, buy giving him everything he wants.There's something mystical with Norman's butler too he's her ex-husband and her director, played by Erich von Stroheim. What makes this film so unique is that it is designed very carefully to the smallest detail. It's full of intelligence, observations, mastery, ruthlessness, it's an agonizing film about the flip side of Hollywood. The American critics, the media, the producers and the people working in the commercial film industry saw a reflection of themselves in Sunset Blvd. The people working with cinema far away praised it for its ruthless way of dealing with actual issues below the surface. No one had actually brought these things up, so it was a very intellect idea for Wilder to do it. In addition to its main theme, the flip side of Hollywood glamor, it criticizes the way media deals with people. The disregard of human life, so many people don't care about each other, they just want to sell their stories. \"Then they got a couple of pruning hooks from the garden and fished me out... ever so gently. Funny, how gentle people get with you once you're dead.\"I had seen Sunset Blvd. on television already, but now I got the chance to see it on the screen in its original format. It was a very interesting experience and I must say that this must be seen on screen, don't miss your chance if you come across with one. Sunset Boulevard is a gorgeous film about cinema and the media. It shows us the bad sides of this industry. It's also a beautiful tale of humanity and love, obsession and lust, oblivion and memory. The flip side of Hollywood glamor has now been shown to us.",

It functions very well together. Furthermore, there are cameos by many studio greats from decades before, and it was fun trying seeing them aged. It was really fun seeing Buster Keaton.It had a couple moments of not-so-momentous revelations and despite its irony, appeared to flip into its own melodramaticism, although it didn't seem too out of place, considering the characters involved.

I can't think of a precedent for a woman taking on such a perilous role in a serious movie, and I doubt that any of today's maturing -- OK, aging -- woman stars would do it on a dare, let alone agree to play side-by-side with film clips from their glory days.

William Holden is also excellent in a role that energized his own acting career. In real life, Holden suddenly landed in Billy Wilder's mansion with much greater success than his down-and-out character, Joe Gillis. I also enjoyed Erich von Stroheim as Max, Desmond's first husband and a strong enabler of her deadly delusions.Ordinarily, I don't like Hollywood films about Hollywood as they usually lack the necessary, objective distance to portray its self-absorbed, narcissistic environment accurately and honestly, but this film is a notable exception, even if it sometimes has trouble sustaining the powerful impact of its riveting opening, including Holden's haunting voiceover as the floating corpse in the pool who has returned to life in order to tell us his sad but fascinating story.Anyway, Gillis finally gets the swimming pool of his dreams, but at what cost? Hopefully, Betty Kramer--no Schaefer--and Artie Green live happily ever after she reunites with him in Arizona. And what about Norma?

The entire film she seems to be on the brink of a meltdown and her obsession with reviving her movie career and her romance with Joe always seem to be pushing her closer and closer to the edge. In a way I found myself loving and hating Joe, at one second I would rooting for him to escape and be with Betty but at the same time he was stringing Norma along. The use of dark and light in the film give a real feel of what life was like for everyone inside Norma's estate. Most of the scenes inside her home are quite dark and gloomy while any of the scenes in which Joe escapes are bright and jovial. This reflects Hitchcocks use of dark and light in his film Notrious.

Accidentally finds himself in property of rich Hollywood star and his life changes and will not end well. Joe is a screenwriter that was hired by Norma, rich and once popular star, as they start living together despite his disapproval. His craving for money rises and it is consuming him but she starts to fall in love with him and their situation gets very complicated. Norma dreams of return to old track but it was all just a story told by Max, her assistant that deals with everything. In his search for comfort he befriends Betty, a reader that had bad opinion on his work, and now as they are working together behind Norma's back they are starting to develop feeling for each other. Finally he realizes that everything is choking him and he plans to ruin everything and let Becky go to her fianc\u00e9. As he leaves house Norma shoots him in back and he is left floating in pool. Police and reporters arrived and as Norma is leaving her room Max prepares scene for her and she feels like a star once more. Only problem with the film is pacing at times it feels very slow but incredible story and directing keeps us interested and going. Holden's performance as Joe is very nice as he is obviously struggling to keep everything in place and to have a decent life but in all drama and changing he got himself killed. Gloria Swanson is also very good as she is obsessed with Joe and herself at first place. Stroheim as Max was fabulous as he is calm but strong character with amazing attitude. Writing of the movie is great as dialogues are profound but at the same time they have a strong points and lots of drama. 3.5/4",

Sunset Blvd in my opinion was an interesting and well done movie. \"Im ready for my closeup Mr. Deville.\" is one of the more famous quotes in movie history. The one part that i thought was a little weird was the dead monkey scene. its not everyday you see a person with a pet monkey. but the way Norma Desmond acted, was alittle weird and obsessive for my taste. the funeral ceremony of the dead monkey in Norma's courtyard must have been for one important chimp. the lighting and picture of this black and white film noir are captivating and impressive;example, the strange butler playing the creepy organ in the middle of the most deep and dustiest sets ever. For Holden, he has the voice-over of the perfect narrator for this movie. How little did he know that when he pulled his car into a driveway off of the boulevard that it would change his life forever! He is the symbol of the struggle to get notoriety. Swanson as Norma Desmond is the symbol of lost fame and has become the talk of legend.",

I really loved how they took the big glimpse into the background of Hollywood and show business, with themes regarding it that are still timely and true today.

            "content": "Normally, I save these reviews to examine the technical aspects of what goes into a film. However, when a film like Sunset Boulevard plays across my screen, I feel compelled to go into a deep analysis about the story, especially one as self-aware as this.A screenwriter Joseph Gillis (William Holden) escaping from creditors gets a flat tire and parks his car in a seemingly abandoned extravagant mansion. He enters, to find the house very much inhabited by a faded silent film actress Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her butler, Max (Erich Von Manstein). This is what sets up the rest of the plot, and it's my personal belief that this entire movie was an allegory for the decline of the movie industry in the 1950s.Gloria Swanson, for one, is best known for her silent films - and she essentially plays a hammed-up crazy version of herself in this film, wanting to relive the vanity and glamor she once had on the silver screen. If she represents the old, Holden's Gillis represents the new - a writer trying to make it using hollow plot techniques (a baseball movie called Bases Loaded? Come on...) There are several industry in-jokes that make this movie a joy, including (but not limited to:) A screenplay that started about the dust bowl being filmed entirely in a torpedo boat, extras only being limited to three drinks of punch per, and the realization that actors make terrible writers.As stated before, though, it's the allegorical content that really makes this movie watchable again and again and again. If Gillis represents the new studio movement and Desmond represents ye olde guard, the story takes on a completely new light. New studios are hamstrung by the old crowd and the old standards (Hays codes, etc.), and they pass up opportunities on new properties and new developments (represented by Nancy Olsen's character Betty Schaefer), standing by fading stars holding onto their last glimpses of vanity, until they are literally bled dry and dying; as seen by Gillis' death. A fantastic movie, and I didn't even get to mention the cameo by Buster Keaton, silent film legend who unsurprisingly has one line of dialog.",

In addition, the scene that the main actress did a joke to be \"Charly\" is very enjoyable with performing the background music. Finally, it is very weird to have the main actor voice after he died, and definitely the last scene that the main actress walked down from the stair like princess is very interesting the end scene that I have watched movie.",

At first it was boring, the lines were old, the action melodramatic. I always felt that movies were the best way to express human emotions, but at the same time, the cruel and heartless wheels of movies also killed the souls of many filmmakers.Wilder was one of the directors who established the cinematic style of film noir, and this film is the most visually provocative of his film noir series. This sense of unreality creates a dreamlike atmosphere on the one hand, and on the other hand, a little bit of terror, thus setting the tone of the film's double variation. The film ends with one of the most iconic scenes in film history.",

Then the acting; William Holden does a more than solid job but it is the performance of Gloria Swanson that really is unforgettable. Theatrical, melodramatic and all the better for it. It's a great view to a bygone era with small roles of big names from that era. The original opening sets the tone of the film perfect. Definitely worth checking out if you haven't seen it yet.

While he is escaping from the debtors he finds an old house that looks abandoned, but it is not. Norma Desmond (Swanson), old glory of the silent movies era lives there. Joe agrees to review a terrible script that the diva is writing, dreaming of a sensational return to the set. The atmosphere of the house is black, dark, almost deadly. The diva projects continually her old movies, guests are mummies, this fact proves that she is obsessed with herself and her career. Relevant figure is the domestic Von Mayerling (Stroheim), he is also the first husband of Norma. She ends up falling in love of the young man, but Joe is in love with his colleague Olson. Gillis for a while accepts the situation but then he starts to be worried and afraid. But Norma, now mad and out of her mind, shoots him while he is leaving. Man falls into the pool, a symbol of the things he had so desired. Norma became mad because she doesn't want to accept the fact that she is not a star anymore, she doesn't want to accept that she is old and not anymore young and beautiful: during the film she tries to look younger thanks to clamorous long beauty treatments; she doesn't want to open her eyes and she doesn't want to see the truth. The story is told by Gillis, who is already dead, in the third person in a long flashback. Everything in the film is dusty, old, broken and decadent. The tragic music and the colors of the pictures help raising the effectiveness of the story. Everything is specifically about the world of the cinema: the dialogs, the life of the cinema studies, even the legendary gate of Paramount. This film is not traditionally dramatic, it is a unique film noir.",

Told in flashback narration by William Holden, it tells the story of how he tried to hide from a couple of mobsters who were chasing him and accidentally stumbled across the home of former silent movie star Norma Desmond (perfectly played by Gloria Swanson). Desmond has a huge ego and believes that everyone is still in love with her films and wants her to make a comeback. As Holden is paid to write a screenplay for her, the film's tragic story begins to unfold. The story doesn't matter to this film's greatness. It's the way everything about this movie was done that makes it a timeless, excellent movie. It's some of the best dialogue you will ever hear. See the film once and you'll remember Norma Desmond forever. She is a perfect character that gives brilliant acting to every scene. For example, when Holden first recognizes her, he exclaims that she is Norma Desmond, the silent movie star who used to be big, to which she responds, in my favorite line of the film, \"I am big, it's the pictures that got small!\" I don't think there was a more brilliant way she could have said this. Swanson was completely robbed for Best Actress by Judy Holliday for \"Born Yesterday.\" You will not see a film this good anymore. I can't recommend it enough. If it seems too strange, keep watching anyway, and watch a second time if necessary. Absolutely perfect.**** out of ****",

It starts off with a film noir style introduction that feels slightly forced, but the movie has a self-awareness about it that doesn't try to make fun of movies as much as it pokes fun at how silent films had become extinct and how movie making had changed. The movie quickly switches genres like Zombieland. One scene is straight out of film noir; another scene is out of a screwball comedy. It is easy to see how the movie comes together after seeing the first scene, but it gets increasingly interesting and unpredictable until the final moment when you really can see how everything happens. The final scene feels like a glorious send off with lighting present everywhere showing how much technology is necessary for a glossy scene of glamor. Parts of the movie felt like watching someone else in the movie watching a movie. Also I was eating a blueberry muffin while watching it and that made it better for me.The movie was very well cast. All parts were played very well. It was almost creepy because Gloria Swanson's character almost felt like the real her if she were instead insane and experiencing delusions of grandeur. Cameos by famous actors and Cecil B. DeMille as themselves made it feel even more surreal like it was a documentary, but it was far from it.Lighting and sound was good.

Swanson is the faded butterfly who was once so great that a maharajah once came all the way from India to beg one of her silk stockings. Later he strangled himself with it.There's every clich\u00e9 of dark satire imaginable here. An organ that plays itself as the wind moves through it, a mysterious servant who is more than he seems, the cynical observer drawn into the intoxicating world of a bygone age preserved pitilessly inside a wax museum of a mansion where the ballroom was re-floored to please Valentino. The only difference is that it was the endless stream of imitators that made these things clich\u00e9.

I went on Wikipedia to read what happens at the beginning. I won't share any spoilers, but I will say, I'm happy I didn't see it from the opening, because the ending really surprised me. Sometimes movies that show the ending at the beginning kind of take the fun out of watching to see what happens next. A young screenwriter named Joe Gillis (William Holden), who is struggling to stay afloat due to his poor writing, moves in with a self-absorbed, emotionally unbalanced former silent film star, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who is trying to make a comeback to the film industry. He agrees to work for her as a script doctor. She falls in love with him, and this causes problems, since he's not attracted to older women. Due to her romantic feelings not being reciprocated, she has incessant meltdowns and tries to make him feel guilty for refusing her advances. When she sees his name on a script next to that of a female's, with whom he was collaborating (Betty Schaefer, played by Nancy Olson) - and who he found himself having feelings for - she begins calling Betty repeatedly, trying to incite suspicion within her so she would stay away from him. The creepiness in this film was superbly portrayed. I also loved Joe's narration. I felt like it added an element of suspense. And Gloria Swanson was an excellent choice to play Norma Desmond. She is a really bizarre character. Her mansion is filled with nothing but pictures of herself. She has a New Year's Eve party and doesn't invite anyone. The weirdness of her personality and her vanity, along with the terror that Joe feels as he is living with her, make for a fascinating story. She's only his employer, but she starts controlling his life. She wants him to feel trapped in her house, and he is perpetually confused by her erratic behavior. Towards the end of the movie, Joe is unfazed by Norma's crying and over the top antics. There was some realism to that. When you spend time with a person who's always throwing temper tantrums, it reaches a point where it gets old. You know they have mental issues, but at the same time, you become burned out from dealing with their negative treatment of you.There was some predictability with Norma falling for Joe, but I found myself absorbed into the story because I wanted to see how her feelings for him unfolded. The acting was remarkable! I know there's people who are excited for the new Top Gun movie as I'm typing this, but I have no interest in watching it, or the original for that matter. Seeing this movie exemplifies why Tom Cruise can't act his way out of a paper bag. I prefer classic films over new ones. The performances from the actors, as well as the story's structure and dialogue, are just so much better. \"Sunset Blvd\" is a must see if you are a fan of movies from the golden age of Hollywood, before it became Hollywerid.",

Added to this is a not so successful writer who gets stuck with her and her wild fantasies of making a movie with her own script which shows nothing more than her face. She lives a life where she fails to realize that she is long forgotten and so are silent films. The movie basically explores how fame and deception can change the life of any person and how hard it can be to realize the truth.

I've heard some people call this a criticism of Hollywood, but I don't think that's right, at least not to the extent of saying that the film is primarily about that. I think it's about not being able to let go of the past, as Joe says to Norma at the end of the film \"There's nothing wrong with being 50, as long as you're not trying to be 25.\" I probably paraphrased a little, but that's the idea.

            "content": "Sunset BoulevardWell this is the first review I have ever written and all I can say is, what a film to start with. I've chosen not to include spoilers in my reviews whether the film is old or is the most recent release, simply because I want others to find out what happens and make up their own minds. That is one of the many beauties of Cinema, it is subjective!First of all, 'Sunset Boulevard' is a masterful film. It certainly is one of the best films depicting Hollywood that has ever been made. Director Billy Wilder makes us, the audience, submit to what I would call the Hollywood Nightmare. How one can be at the highest of highs with their fame and career but once the industry is done with them, they are cascaded aside and left to live in the past. Norma Desmond, played magnificently by Gloria Swanson, is the example of this. From the first time we see Norma introduced in the film, we can start to unravel that this is a woman who is clearly a faded film star but is obsessed with making that return to fame. Mentally she is consumed by her popularity and constantly reminds Joe Gillis (William Holden) that all the fans send her letters, accelerating her need for the comeback. This is such a big positive of the film, the performances of Gloria Swanson and William Holden as Norma and Joe respectively blow my mind. It baffles me how Gloria did not win the Academy Award that year (1951) for Best Actress, instead losing out to Judy Holliday for 'Born Yesterday'. As I say, William Holden plays the bankrupt screenwriter Joe Gillis brilliantly and his relationship onscreen with Gloria shines through, as they go on the thrill ride of working together but also struggle to connect on any level, simply because of Norma's mental state. Furthermore, Erich Von Stroheim portrays Norma's Butler Max excellently and his presence on screen suggests something is hidden in the narrative. What I mean by that is, Max is very hidden and does as he's told, only later in the film do we find out why. Not only that, the ending of this film is one of the best I've seen in film. Once you understand the meaning of it and how it summarises the film, I'm sure you will come to the same conclusion.In terms of the negatives of the film, I would say, there are really none I can find. I don't like being picky and find silly reasons to be negative about a film, certainly a film as good as this one.This is, in my opinion, Billy Wilders masterpiece. I have seen 'Double indemnity' also and regard that very highly as it was a film I studied while at school, however after seeing 'Sunset Boulevard' a couple days ago, it left a very positive mark on me. I will never forget the performances in this film as I have mentioned several times, they were just that good. I'm sure this film set the benchmark for many future directors on how to depict Hollywood and the ups and downs a career in the industry can bring. A Masterpiece. Simple as thatQuote of the Film - 'I am Big, it's the pictures that got small' - Norma DesmondRating - 9.5/10",

I always thought that meta is a much modern device. In a way you could rationalize, especially when culture and media become more ubiquitous and easy to access, that every story has been told. All the plots are rehashed and every trope has been established, therefore the last refuge is being meta: the commentary on it.In my opinion its not even limited to cinema, and maybe that is why this movie surprised me so much, but most of culture and art form in general. And it might be a consequence of the abundance of art and culture. This is by the way best exemplified in movies like Star Wars and other series. When it came out, it was only thing available; now every movie rips it off, like Guardian of the Galaxy, or pays homage, like the new Star Wars. The only original and fresh avenue is parody, pastiche or deconstruction.The movie's gimmick of looking back to a forgotten era of movie making and commenting on it, is eerie to us because it gives the viewer a similar experience. Or more accurately it is a mise en abyme that is so well executed that you almost forget the movie is more than half a century old.\nOn the technical side the movie is flawless, of course, yet it also lends the movie to be a horror story/monster movie of sorts, with Norma being the Monster. But it really shows the finesse of Billy Wilder who able to create this inverted fairytale, which is also a social drama, and a commentary on Hollywood, all at the same time. Without being overtly explicit and hitting you on the head.It is easy to see why this movie has become a cult classic. It is because it is a golden age movie looking back at a previous golden age. It is like watching Back to Future in 2015 and looking at the 1950 through the lens of the 80s. And it works because the core message stays true and relevant. The movie business of the silent era is the movie business of the 1950s, and it the one of today. The movie is still big it's the other movie that have gotten small.",

The cast is full of silent actors, including Norma, and directors. Even the gossip at the end of the movie was a actor-turned-gossip in truth. Perhaps it had been a stretch for Mrs. Swanson to accept this role. I can't imagine that very many silent-era actors enjoyed the advent of 'talkies'.

One comment on this site even claims that this may be the first time such a device was used in films.NOT SO! In 1947, three years before this film's release, a low-budget independent film called \"Scared To Death\" beat Wilder to it. The film is narrated by the corpse of a young woman lying in a morgue who has been literally \"Scared to Death\" (hence the title). The picture stars Bela Lugosi & George Zucco (not to mention Nat Pendleton!) This is even more interesting when one considers that Wilder originally wanted SB to open with a scene of recently deceased corpses gathered in a morgue discussing their deaths! I must confess that I have a little suspicion, or fantasy if you will, as to how Wilder arrived at his vision for the opening sequence. After indulging in his little known (until now!) fetish for low-budget horror films (possibly the result of associating with his brother, W. Lee), I believe Wilder was on his way home from the theater musing on what he had just seen when the thought came to him: \"Nobody who sees my movies is likely to see THIS! If these guys think opening the movie with narration by one corpse is something, I'll open one with a whole roomful!\" Only the killjoys at Paramount Studios prevented Wilder's vision from reaching the screen as he originally intended. Admittedly the scene which ultimately did open the movie is at least equally bizarre and imaginative, as well as being breathtakingly shot.Is there something to the Scared To Death/Sunset Blvd connection?

She revels in her superstar status, delusional that it still exists; she's maintained in her mansion and these delusions of returning to public adulation and screen glory by her former film director (& former husband), now her butler-chauffeur (von Stroheim).

It was THE first film to take a critical look at how Hollywood operated, especially in treating its former stars--& most especially young women--who were typically cast aside when they they lost their late teens/early twenties aura and glow. Film buffs will love the many inner details of this film: e.g., von Stroheim was actually Swanson's director in making the film which he (as butler) runs for the 2 leads to see. Swanson's imitation of Chaplin's Tramp is precious.

To understand it today we have to recall that silent movie actors in the 1920s were living legends in the eyes of adoring film fans around the world. Also, at the half-way mark of the twentieth century there were still film studios that employed full-time labor (paying living wages) in a variety of supporting positions, allowing undiscovered talent the opportunity to climb the ranks. There was so much general excitement about Hollywood's contribution to world culture in 1950 that Billy Wilder's depiction of a mentally disturbed, former movie star undoubtedly rankled some of his peers.When Joe Gillis (William Holden) meets Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), both aspire a higher station in Hollywood. Gillis, a hack screenwriter experiencing tough times, is being chased by repo men who want his car. Gillis arrives at Norma's decaying, seemingly unoccupied mansion out of sheer desperation. Gillis is fairly likable, but when given the opportunity he takes what he needs from others. Norma, who surrounds herself with photographs from her youth (i.e., early publicity pics of comely Gloria Swanson\ufeff), is not well. She spends her days obsessed with the adulation she used to receive and cannot accept the reality that her film career is kaput. (BTW, for six years Gloria Swanson was the leading attraction at Paramount Pictures\ufeff.) Gillis becomes a kept man, accepting Norma's gifts and eventually becoming her lover. As Gillis rises in stature, it is inevitable that he will want more than he has. Temptation arrives in the form of Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), the youthful script girl and fianc\u00e9 of Joe's close friend Artie (Jack Webb). Betty aspires to be a screenwriter, wants to team up professionally with Joe, and her eyes light up like firecrackers when she states her intention to do the hard work needed to break through. It is very likely that (director and second-listed screenwriter) Billy Wilder created Betty to represent his dream love. She sure is mine.A very memorable character is Norma's butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim\ufeff). Max faithfully serves the decaying Norma, maintaining her illusion of aristocracy (that silent film stars knew for real). Max suffers almost unendurably, but never receives any attention for doing so. Regarding that Stroheim had some great success as an actor and a director, this role perfectly submerges him. This is also seen with the cameos by Buster Keaton\ufeff, Hedda Hopper, H. B. Warner and Anna Q. Nilsson. Considering Keaton's real-life stature as a silent-era superstar, watching the legendary comedian in advanced years quietly playing Bridge in that decrepit room reminds us that Time never plays favorites.This is arguably Billy Wilder's best effort as a director. He does a very good job with the mansion interiors, creating a mysterious and suspenseful feeling. (One quibble with the writing is the name-dropping, particularly early on.) Gloria Swanson should have won an Academy Award for her fearless, often-imitated performance of Norma. William Holden\ufeff plays the opportunistic Joe Gillis with complexity. Nancy Olson as Betty is simply adorable. While the cast is very strong overall, I do have some disagreement with the multiple scenes with Cecil B. DeMille\ufeff portraying himself which serve to make him appear thoughtful and sensitive to Norma's problems. (Was Billy Wilder trying to kiss DeMille's rear end?) Overall, \"Sunset Boulevard\" is a very rich experience for audience members who still daydream about working in peak Hollywood. Cinephiles should have their chauffeur steer their Isotta-Fraschini over to the next revival theater that shows it.",

Gillis is obliged to accept this proposal but by the time he follows other jobs and Desmont believes lots of people are still fan of her, but she doesn't know the reality that Max writes those letters to her.Anyway,Desmont goes to an old director for a new film but she doesn't know that she is called for her old car upon using in a film. Desmont also envies Gillis and she disturbs his partner for a project by calling her.Till this point, the film is very boring so that I can play Solitaire in a small window at the same time. But the last three minutes are very creative in which Joe invites her friend and partner Betty to face up with reality. He rejects Betty and after that also Norma. Norma shoots him while leaving the house and he falls down to the pool.Police, journalists and Paramount pictures immediately come to the event place and an artificial film is made in event place as she wanted. Of course all those occur when Norma is in shock.I apologize for the lots of spoilers that I wrote above but if one day I want to remember the film, it is really necessary because the rest of film is really very boring except for last three minutes.I don't comment for any technical details or performances of actors or directing. It's understood just watching it.",

The plot and script reflect her true life story and there are references to her career in the film bringing even more realism to this human drama.Swanson shines brightest but the performance of William Holden as the struggling desperate writer was Oscar worthy - even though he didn't win he was nominated. Holden's unusual narrative during the film adds a clever and beautiful touch of surrealness to the stark reality.Lookout for quite a few classic Hollywood cameos, references and lines that weaves more fun to this darkest of comedy/dramas which is shot in black and white in classic noir style.One of the most famous lines in the film belongs to Swanson as fading star Norma Desmond, who with ego-maniacal stare declares \"I am big...it was the pictures that got small\", a reference to movies going onto TV.With each viewing this picture seems to get bigger making all that's come after it, look small. It's a truly great Hollywood tale with memorable characters and with the bonus of some real life movie legends playing themselves in yet another Billy Wilder classic.",

The reason is simple - our society today isn't anything at all like it was in 1950 or so. The tension created by the (then) inverted relationship shown between male and female lacks any traction today. So this movie is today enjoyable as a window of what society thought proper over 50 years go. Swanson gives a superb performance which many take as over the top chewing the scenery today. However, you need to keep in mind that the sort of excessive emoting she does in this movie is stylistically in tune with the way silent stars needed to act to get their message across. Yes, I agree with those who've said the plot is silly, outlandish and contrived. So what? The plot only exists as a vehicle so the movie about relationships can exist. I'd suppose the enjoyment of this movie would be proportional to your age. A 75 year old personally remembers those times and would find it personally interesting. A 50 year old would have heard of those times and find it interesting in what he missed. A 15 year old would view the movie as a bizarre bore unless he were a student of history or the movies. A good accompanying movie to this one would be 'Detective Story' with Kirk Douglas - again from the same time period. Like here, the tension generated by the central story is laughable by today's standards, but resonated with audiences way back then.",

I never quite got that ! So he has people trying to repossess his car ? Big deal. He could hide in a million other places and still work on his script with Norma from there... he doesn't *have* to stay at her place if he feels uncomfortable there (that is before he starts finding advantages in her wealth) ... but somehow he feels he has no alternative... yet he does.Anyway, despite these two major flaws (and other minor flaws), the film remains extremely enjoyable 50 years after its release.After watching this movie, I find funny to notice the growing interest of people for psychiatric cases in movies (\"Psycho\", \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\", \"Birdy\", \"Whatever Happened To Baby Jane ?\", \"Rain Man\", ... ).",

For all the hype about how much of a classic it is, I didn't really see it. This film is about a washed-up millionaire silent film actor, who seems off her rocker from the very beginning, and ropes in a broke writer to her crazy world. This is referencing actual events because a lot of the silent film actors weren't good in the talkie films. There have been other films about this including Singin' in the Rain (1952) directed by Donen and Kelly. This being the part of the plot doesn't seem like it would make it a classic. There were some really good scenes like the one with Betty Shaefer and Joe Gillis writing a script together and walking about at night. I loved the lighting, the fluidness between the two characters and the way they instantly clicked together. The camera angles perfectly captured their facial expressions especially when they were out for a walk. But the rest seemed too drawn out and not very suspenseful.Although I didn't appreciate the film as some may, I did think that Holden played the character of Gillis very well. He was able to portray the emotions of the character, loneliness, depression, and a few others, through no words at all. Just through his posture, facial expressions and his tone. Nancy Olson did a good job with her character as well, Betty Schaefer. You could see her confliction about Joe and Artie and then she realized she didn't want to marry Artie and you saw the despair and the want for Joe on her face and in her posture. I didn't think Gloria Swanson was the right character to play Norma Desmond. Her face, posture, and how she looked just didn't fit with how imagine the character to be. Wilder did do some good things with this film, but in the end it just seemed pretty flat to me.",

            "content": "The production design of this film helped convey the stories main theme: When a person refuses to detach from their former and forgotten identity, not only is their progression damned, but the potential to be manipulative, codependent, and obsessive reign supreme in order to keep the illusion alive.Struggling screen writer, Joe Gillis, meets by way of happenstance the former silent-screen goddess, Norma Desmond. Norma is an aged woman who has lived quietly and practically alone for many years in her spacious and what seems like deserted mansion; fooling herself into believing that the world is ready for her \"return\" (not \"comeback\") to the millions of fans who have never forgiven her for deserting the screen so many years ago. Norma's refusal to detach from her former and forgotten identity as a big Hollywood star is dramatically heightened through the use of production design.The predominant set used throughout this film is Norma's spacious mansion\u0097an environment that suggests luxury and comfort for a woman who is still living off of the money she waged through a former identity. The illusory and narcissistic life that Norma continues to live is heightened through the heavy use of mise-en-scene. Framed pictures and portraits of Norma's face are displayed all throughout her mansion\u0097most of which capture moments of past films she's acted in. She even has her own movie theater where she shows Joe the old films that she starred in. As she romanticizes and woos over her past, Joe, as well as the viewer, becomes aware of her inability to divorce herself from her former identity.Her bedroom also expresses the illusion she is under through elegancy. From a throne-like bed with silk draped from corner to corner, to fluffy and intricate pillows, exotic plants and decorative mirrors, all of these props are used to help convey to the viewer Norma's obsession with her past. In short, she is living a lie. Her stylish material possessions are what keep her from progressing onward with her life. She seems content with living in the past and will object to anyone that tries to disturb her comfort zone (as seen when she kills Joe in the end\u0097a man she fell in love with and had difficulty detaching herself from after he walked out on her, thus disturbing her comfort zone).Along with the props, her striking wardrobe is also effectively contrasted with the rest of the characters in the film. While she is clothed in expensive and fancy attire, Joe is dressed in rugged slacks and tattered buttoned shirts. There is a scene where Norma merges her own identity crisis onto Joe when she takes him shopping for new clothes. This was her way of subconsciously manipulating her own ideologies of her forgotten identity onto someone else\u0097the intended purpose, of course, was for her to perpetuate her narcissistic influence into those that would succumb to her manipulation. The use of make-up is also exploited to dramatize the main theme. In order for Norma to retain her old self, she undergoes extensive beauty treatments in preparation for her \"return\". Extreme close-ups reveal an ageless and beautiful woman, yet ironically throughout the rest of the film she is exposed as she really is\u0097an old and wrinkled woman who is attempting to hold onto something that has past.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder was truly a master of cinema, a man who could made some of the greatest movies of all time, with some of them being comedies and some of them being dramas. In 1950, he made a film that some have called a Hollywood horror story, particularly in regards to some of the darker aspects of the industry, a film that in many ways, has grown more relevant with the passage of time, and one that is earned a place in being one of the finest achievements in cinematic history.Sunset Boulevard is a film that I would definitely rank as one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen, it is perfect in every sense. It's a powerful and even emotional film that pulls no punches as it deconstructs the myth of Hollywood, by showing that said place isn't as glorious as it seems. And furthermore, it also features some of the best writing to be spoken on film, as well as some of the best acting to ever appear in front of a camera.The film begins with police discovering a dead body floating in a pool, while some narration describes what's happening, with the narration coming from the dead man himself. Told mostly in flashback, the film focuses on Joe Gillis, a screenwriter who stumbles upon a rather rundown mansion while he's running from some men who try to take his car. Turns out that the mansion belongs to a faded silent film star named Norma Desmond, whose only company is her manservant, Max. Desmond is determined to make a film that will represent her return to the limelight, and she manages to rope Joe into writing a film for her. Little does Joe realize however, that Norma has become so determined, that she has no idea how a relationship works, and she'll do whatever it takes to make a return, even if it involves resorting to measures that will prevent Joe from leaving.For 1950, this film was certainly bold, particularly with its subject matter, because it dared to show what Hollywood was (and in many ways, still is) like. To specify, Hollywood is a place where actors and actresses are primed and prepped to become luminaries, and rise to the top of fame and fortune, only to be shown the door whenever their services are no longer needed, and in the process, the film also takes a few less than subtle stabs at directors and producers. Such ideas and moods are buoyed by the stark black and white cinematography, which adds to the rather downbeat subject matter. Black and white can always add to the drama of a film, but such an element was especially strong here, because it added to the mood of the film, and it helped convey the message that Hollywood isn't as glamourous as one imagines. And furthermore, Billy Wilder's writing and directing are sublime, in which (with contributions from Charles Brackett) keeps everything in balance to perfect a masterpiece of cinema.In regards to the acting, I don't think you find better performances in a film than in this one. William Holden was astounding in his role, in which he tries to play Norma like a violin, but only ends up getting himself entangled further. Erich von Stroheim was also incredible as Max, who like Norma, was also in silent films. Stroheim was in ways playing himself, particularly near the end (and I won't say what it is exactly), when he gets the opportunity to \"direct\", which was what Stroheim had been decades prior. There have been some who have called Gloria Swanson's performance one of the greatest in cinema history, which is a sentiment that I can agree with. To say that she was sublime would be putting it lightly. Much like Stroheim, Swanson was in some ways, playing herself, as she was once a silent film star who had become irrelevant as time went on, which is what Norma Desmond essentially is. Is Desmond insane? In many ways, yes. However, what makes it effective is that she only shows signs of it at first, and in some intervals, it becomes rather intimidating the further she descends. One would be rather hard pressed to say that there's a better performance in any film than Gloria Swanson's effort in this film.While Billy Wilder directed many classic films, probably his best and most powerful is this one. Even though everything else about the film was perfect, it was primarily Wilder's directing that made everything work to perfection. Sunset Boulevard is a film that has only become more relevant with the passage of time, because though the film may seem to be an elegy to the silent era and the stars who performed during said era, the film is much more than that, it's an in depth look at the film industry, that shows some of the darker aspects of it, which is very much like Hollywood today. Ultimately, this is a film that anyone who appreciates cinema should so, as many films don't get much better than this timeless cinematic classic.",

Other elements are lost, no doubt, because we can't go back to the place and time, when THOSE audiences may have had a different set of assumptions and biases re: Hollywood.

We can tell Joe loves her, but with the condition of sympathy, guilt and shame, and it is all because of the 20-year-old age difference and the huge gap in their social status, the film is bold tirade aiming at the hypocritical showbiz of its ageism and male chauvinism. For Norma, Joe represents the last straw of her life, her mirage of being an eternal star which is timeless and beloved.Swanson gives a show-stopping tour-de-force as Norma, exaggerates her condescending mannerism with dramatic grandeur and empress mien, the trademark popped eyes and protruding jaw perfectly render a thrilling pathos as someone who is ridiculously ill-fitted in the present world thanks to her own background which is painfully similar to Norma. The film gifts Swanson the only opportunity to shine in the talkie era and she accomplishes it with impeccability, this is one of the most powerful performance ever (I give her an edge over the equally iconic performance from Betty Davis in ALL ABOUT EVE 1950, 9/10), and its indelible impact is caustically mind-blowing, not to mention her final descending from the stairs to the cameramen, and her iconic last line.Swanson is not the only one carry an autobiographic curve in the story, so is Erich von Stroheim, as Max, her dour but loyal butler-cum-chauffeur, the only one takes care of her in the decadent manor, more shockingly is later he reveals to be Norma's first husband and the director who has brought her to stardom and accompanies her into obsolescence.

It's with Norma Desmond that Joe Gillis finally finds an opportunity to work on her script which is intended to bring her back to the limelight at the age of 50.The movie tells us quite a bit about the zeitgeist of the time it was made in. Keeping Hollywood as the background the movie majorly occurs in the manor of Norma Desmond. The story itself tells quite a bit about the state of Hollywood in the 50's and the shift from the silent era to the talkie era. It also touches on the struggles in Hollywood and how aspects such as finding opportunities or having your scripts heard works.The film specifically gives you quite a bit of insight into the life of Norma Desmond as a faded movie star from another era and her desire to get back into limelight, it truly goes into how it feels to feel to be a movie star and past your prime. In fact one of Joe Gillis' lines saying \"There's nothing tragic about being 50, not unless you try to be 25,\" truly sums up what the film was trying to say with her character. In fact, this set-up can be seen as symbolism about how women feel after a particular peak in life whether in terms of beauty or career and suffering a midlife crisis in that period, unable to accept aging and the lack of the admiration and respect received before.The plot line for Norma Desmond was quite intriguing in the sense that it was quite unexpected with the turns the writer took with the character and I was quite surprised with the direction taken in regards to Norma Desmond falling in \"love\" with Joe Gillis who was in love with Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson). Betty Shaefer had an intriguing character as a script reader and the inputs she gave to Joe Gillis were intriguing to watch.Overall, this is an interesting film and truly holds up as a classic and I might even consider it as one of my favorite movies from the '50s. It's a great character study that truly looks at how it is to be fading star. And the ending was quite unexpected for me as I forgot the beginning by that point.",

It is in fact a curse cast upon society, and it has in fact no good ending for most of those who strive for it. Nowhere in the world does the strive for fame occur more often than in the world of glitz and glamour in Hollywood. Hollywood may seem perfect on the outside, but on the inside, there is a deep dark truth about fame. Fame fades fast.The Hollywood epic \"Sunset Boulevard\" captures the hunger for fame excellently in this dark humour comical drama film noir. We meet the famous Norma Desmond played beautifully by the great Gloria Swanson. Norma is a faded star wanting rejuvenation and a glamorous return to the big screen. She is in fact desperate, and she doesn't have a life and a personality behind what is projected on the big screen. She lives in a fantasy, and certainly has psychological struggles to come to terms with who she has become.Norma lures a young writer named Joe Gillis (William Holden) to her castle and uses him for her own desires. She tries to get a hold on him, almost like a succubus grabs a hold of its prey. The lengths she goes to stay relevant and feed her fantasy lifestyle is captured beautifully by director Billy Wilder. The director deploys dark comical moment expertly to show the audience that Norma Desmond's life is not what it seems on the outside, and he even has a funeral scene for a chimpanzee to show the nonsensical world she lives her life.Sunset Boulevard is a great metaphor for Hollywood in many ways, and it greatly reflects Hollywood even to present date. The way in which the movie uses metaphors and symbolism such as with Norma's car, and impractical gold-plated old heap of junk is a stunning nod to the excess for excess sake symbol that have come to plague Hollywood. Sunset boulevard oozes excess and extravagance which is all a facade, and you get to know content and context when you watch the scenes with joe in his office writing a screenplay.The cinematography in the movie is overall great, and it achieves all its goals of being an almost film noir. The movie has a linear structure, and follows that of a romantic film. The directorial choice of portraying the movie in black and white gives the editors a big chance to display shadows and light in a way that compliments the story, and they achieve this to great success.I especially enjoyed the brilliant acting and over the top moments of Gloria Swanson. She is one of Hollywood's all-time greats and this, In my opinion is her Magnum Opus. This film ages better and better over time like a fine wine, and is to be enjoyed for decades to come.My rating: 91/100.",

For example, Sunset Blvd. 2002 could star Jack Nicholson as Norman Desmond and Roman Polanski as Max. They spend their evenings screening Chinatown again and again while complaining bitterly about the \"weasles at Paramount\" who won't return their calls. Jack sits stooped over his typewriter for days on end, adding yet another scene to his mammoth comeback screenplay, 'Five More Easy Pieces', while Roman pens phony fan letters for his deluded boss, scented with Chanel #5. Jack works tirelessly each day except Wednesday, when Warren Beatty, Peter Fonda and Karen Black come over and, between bong hits and hands of canasta, swap bittersweet stories of the good old days of Hollywood, before \"the suits\" took over. Jack's downfall is completed when naive young screenwriter Heather Graham rejects his leering attempts at seduction and is found face down in Jack's swimming pool, bludgeoned to death with his best putter.Next week: Nick Nolte and Walter Hill guzzle lukewarm Old Milwaukee and throw darts at a poster of Eddie Murphy.",

            "content": "\"Stars are ageless, aren't they?\" The glitz and glamor of old Hollywood. The Lights, the Sounds, the Cameras- what happens when they've dissipated as the Stars of yesteryear before them? Sunset Boulevard tells a darkly satirical, yet poignant story of the once-great Norma Desmond- a washed up actress of the silent film era. A woman so consumed with delusion and narcissism that nothing in this world, nor any other could convince her of anything but her own self importance. She's a star, after all. Ironic as it may seem, Norma herself is not the fulcrum of the film, but rather one side of a dichotomy- the conflict between a bygone age, and the modern. In this place of the middle, torn between the two is our protagonist Joe Gillis- a struggling screenwriter trying to strike it big, who happens upon our old Hollywood queen. What comes next is a story that may ring true of many stars who have faded into obscurity- the paralyzing stigma of being a has been, the endless planning of an ever-just-out-of-reach comeback, and the whispers and rumors of days gone by- that yearning for the spotlight, the power, and the attention they once commanded. With a fantastic twist and slick direction, Billy Wilder delivers a hit in this timeless classic. It remains relevant and applicable still, even in today's world, sixty years removed from the original premiere. Sunset Boulevard is a narrative in how fleeting fame can be, but how the effects of it may be everlasting- in both the public eye, and in private. After all, the stars are ageless.",

            "content": "Billy Wilder's Sunset Boulevard tells the story of Joe Gillis (William Holden), a young emerging screenwriter from Ohio struggling to build a career and make ends meet in Hollywood. After evading loan sharks in a high-speed car chase, he blows a tire and peels out into a seemingly abandoned mansion located on the titular street. It turns out to be the residence of silent movie star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who has long ago been chewed up and spit out by the movie-making machine that is Hollywood. She tells him that she had been expecting him when in all reality she was expecting a man bringing a coffin for her recently deceased pet monkey. Little does Gillis know that he was soon to become its replacement. Desmond ensnares Gillis with hopes of relaunching her movie career in the era of \"talkies\" (movies with audio), convincing him to move into the mansion to live with her and her butler, Max (Erich von Stroheim).It is no question that Swanson is the star of this film. Her character is utterly believable: a self-infatuated actress \"past her prime\" as they say, who lives in a constant state of nostalgia. She has all the money anyone could ask for but is stuck in the past, holding on to a dream that has come and gone long ago. Indeed, when this movie came out in 1950, \"talkies\" had been around for quite some time, with Singin' in the Rain starring Al Jolson being the first mainstream movie to feature sound, released back in 1927. It is interesting to observe Desmond's negative attitude toward the evolution of the technology used in Hollywood. The character presents an interesting psychological case: if she were to have it her way, silent movies would have never gone the way of the dodo, which would have been simply unrealistic. It is also interesting to watch her obsession with her appearance devour her: a problem that actresses in Hollywood have to this day.This movie is easy to follow, yet thought-provoking. There are not too many characters to keep track of, and the plot develops at a nice, steady pace. The sticky situation in which our protagonist finds himself may not be relatable but it is understandable. He's basically the woman's sugar baby, in modern terms. The dynamic that grows (or rather, deteriorates) between the two is what makes this movie so captivating. The setting is novel yet believable, and the acting is superb. I really have no complaints.I decided to watch this movie upon the referral of one of my college professors, and I am glad I did! It is definitely worth the 110 minutes of your time, and it was easily among the best movies I saw last year. It is an interesting reflection upon the role that technology plays in society and how the people who are unable to adapt get left behind. It is also a story about heartbreak, be it because of not being loved by someone you want to be loved by, or by having your dreams shattered. These themes are relevant to this day, and in fact, it's hard to believe this movie came out seventy years ago. If you are considering watching this movie, go for it! You will not regret it.",

The house is so suffocatingly sad with all the photos and sculptures that whenever the story goes somewhere else in Hollywood, it's like a breath of fresh air. The nights when Joel and Betty were writing in her office was like waking up from a dream, because it was so mundane and 'real life' compared to Norma Desmond's false reality.\nSunset Blvd. fits flawlessly into the genre of film noir, what with Joel's murder and the crazed Norma Desmond bringing an eerie feeling to all its viewers, but it also does what previous silent and talking movies didn't. It added layers and a complex storyline that more could connect with, instead of just some grand adventure of mystery where everything turned out fine. It wasn't made to tell some happy story where a man and woman meet and fall in love. It told the truth.

I think Gloria Swanson's performance deserves it's place on the list of all-time great ones and Erich Von Stroheim was very good as well. William Holden wasn't bad, he was quite good actually. It was his narration, however, that bothered me throughout the film. I was watching the final scene of Norma Desmond coming down the staircase and I thought to myself, this would be so much creepier if we didn't hear Joe Gillis' voice. Anyway, that's just my thoughts. Despite all that, this is still one of the great ones.10 out of 10",

The inclusion of references to other film stars and film makers also brought a realistic feel to it. Their relationship somehow made me uncomfortable, I'm not sure if it was their age difference or because she was so needy and controlling of him. It did seem he had some feeling for her, because he went back after he found out that she tried to kill herself. That last scene was very powerful with the lights and the crowd, like her swansong.

            "content": "Sunset Boulevard (1950) Hollywood is the land of dreams, fame, money, and broken hearts. \"Sunset Boulevard\" is an almost behind the scenes look at the industry and the type of people in it. Sunset Boulevard is a real road that runs through Los Angeles and Beverly Hills and features real Hollywood landmarks like the movie Mulholland Drive.\"Sunset Boulevard\" opens with a murder scene, murder is always a hot subject in Hollywood, especially if it was someone famous or in the industry, such as Elizabeth Short, an inspiring actress became California's most infamous murder victim in 1947 because of the mystery behind her death and that she was actress and actor River's Phoenix who died from a drug overdose on the actual Sunset Boulevard, outside of the Viper Room. The movie also features a starving struggling writer and his experience with his rotten agent and the movie producer who wants to change his script. There's also the loyal butler, the fresh newbies to the scene writer and the party guy film crew worker. All of these stereotypes work very well to help create the world of Hollywood. They were made so stereotypical to the point of parody to show how crazy it can be to live in Hollywood, or as some people call it, HollyWeird! The bizarreness doesn't stop there, pet monkeys, Directors marring the stars, becoming their butlers, and super ego complexes.At the center of the film is Norman Desmond, as played by Gloria Swanson. Gloria Swanson wasn't by far the first person considered for the film, she wasn't even the sixth. But Gloria Swanson delivers one of the most memorable roles of all time with some of the most famous lines of movie history. Norman Desmond is a former silent movie star the world has seemed to forgotten, living in a huge run down mansion with a faithful butler. With a larger then life ego and in deep denial of her stardom, Norma is a diva that demands a lot of attention and often acts like the world revolves around her. Norma is writing a script when Joe first meets her and after reading it and hearing that it was written from the heart Joe says that it's the best kind of writing, but the script is heavily flawed. Norma longs to return to the limelight, she's had a taste of it and wants it back. She's also looking for someone to love and keep her company. When Joe arrives that fateful day Norma finds a gentleman who could help her with her script, but the relationship slowly grows and changes until Joe has become Norma's show boy. Joe doesn't really like being kept, but soon learns to live with it and enjoy the loveless relationship, well loveless to him. With Joe around Norma becomes more outgoing and ventures outside of her estate and sees more old friends. Much like Norma, Joe's taste of the limelight remains and he also gets caught up back in the industry and starts to enjoy writing once again.Casting is extremely well done for \"Sunset Boulevard\", it casts a former silent movie star Gloria Swanson who fit the role perfectly, to getting cameo appearances from other silent movie era stars. The casting adds to the world of Hollywood and makes it feel real with a real director playing himself (Cecil B. DeMille) and a director(Erich von Stroheim) playing the butler.\"Sunset Boulevard\" contains everything Hollywood has: romance, power, money, deceit, actors, actresses, new comers, writers, directors, murder, a come back attempt, a studio and scandal.",

Or nightmares once the story gets going. And what a story it is!! Above all, the greatest part of the movie isn't anything I've stated before, it's in the themes.In terms of themes and the story itself, I could write an entire paper on this, that's how dense it actually is.

If Joe tries and goes somewhere and shes not with him she acts like she is gonna kill herself. At the end of the movie he tries and leaves but as he walks out she shoots him. It doesn't even phase her. When the cops come she thinks that they are their to shoot her movie. So we see the camera focus on her as she is coming down the stairs.

But then again that was the point of the film (Spoilers coming up).The film deals with Hollywood's evolution and taps upon the superficial nature of the industry especially how it treats it's workers!Gillis, superbly portrayed by Holden, is a screen writer down on his luck who accidentally becomes involved with Norma Desmond, Swanson, silent film star of Yesteryear. Wilder uses his key figures to represent the different ages of Hollywood. Norma Desmond \"Queen of the silent film\" star of Hollywood's Golden era is all but forgotten as Hollywood starts to make films with sound. Gillis whose scripts were popular during the Silver age of Hollywood are suddenly not popular any more as he can not adapt his style fast enough to the demand for riskier story lines. Finally the beautiful Betty Schaefer (Olsen) who represents the future of Hollywood.The film's main point illuminates how as Hollywood changes the people that helped build it are left behind when they cease to become popular. Desmond becomes a hermit - recluse from an industry and fans that deserted her. But in a chance encounter with Gillis she sees an opportunity to come back into the industry by way of a new script she has been working on. The film traces the start, peak and ultimately the demise of the relationship between Desmond & Gillis. A metaphor for the start, peak and ultimate demise of the eras they represented.Very intelligent and well directed film with Stella performances from all key cast & crew.",

Swanson was a great star but she always delivered her lines over the top and frankly I don't think she could have delivered her lines in this movie any other way. She was limited.The direction is excellent and in cinematography alone can this film be said to be superior to All About Eve.I never found William Holden particularly interesting as an actor but he does a credible job here.

            "content": "There is a lot to love about this movie, which is loaded with great performances, and intersects film noir with fading Hollywood stardom. It grabs us from the start with police called to the scene of a mansion with a body floating in its pool, and as we listen to a deadpan narrator. Director Billy Wilder gives us the first of what will be many great shots, this one from what appears to be the bottom of the pool, with policemen in the background standing over the body. The film then flashes back to a young writer (William Holden), down on his luck and pressured by repo men, trying to figure out a way to sell his work or borrow some money. He pulls into the driveway of a mansion by chance, and finds himself slowly entangled in another trap, that of an aging Hollywood star (Gloria Swanson). The feel is eerie from the start, as she seeks funeral arrangements for her pet chimp, lives in boundless ostentation, and has a single companion, her solemn servant (Erich von Stroheim) who plays an organ that otherwise wheezes drearily when the wind blows through it. While her pool and tennis courts have fallen into ruin, she lives in the past, surrounded by her own photographs and watching her own old movies. Out of what he feels to be necessity, he begins working for her and living with her, hating every moment. Gloria Swanson, who was 51, turns in an outstanding performance, and has several fantastic scenes. The one where she and Holden sit in the dark with the projector light going through smoke is brilliant, and one of my favorites. Another is him dancing with her on the floor that she says Valentino had danced on, surrounded by an orchestra and expecting other guests, only to realize there will be none. The one where she imitates Charlie Chaplin, complete with a little tramp outfit, is truly special. Wilder is excellent at gradually revealing just how far gone she is. It was a nice touch of his to include silent movie stars as her bridge companions in a small scene, including Buster Keaton, and to see Cecil B. DeMille on the set at Paramount was fantastic. We see both her delusion of still being an important star as she rolls up to the gate house in her expensive old car (an Isotta-Fraschini), and yet we also see her past stardom recognized by one of the gate keepers, and then people on the set when they realize she's there. It's a very touching moment. Things get more complicated when Holden begins working with the fianc\u00e9 (Nancy Olson) of his affable friend (Jack Webb, soon to be better known for Dragnet). Not all of the scenes revolve around Swanson, and the one where Holden and Olson play act a romantic scene at a party is intelligent, funny, and utterly charming. The film gives us a behind the scenes look at Hollywood - brainstorming over scripts, the writing process, the vanity of those in the limelight, and the opulence. Swanson gets a little over the top at times especially towards the end, but the film feels both sadly true, and yet also fantastical, with her mansion other-worldly and not unlike that of the one Miss Havisham has in 'Great Expectations', as Holden observes early on. With such a setting and those poignant overtones, and having excellent direction, cinematography, script, and cast, it's hard to go wrong with this one.",

She had tons of pictures of herself and it was a good portrayal of her self-absorbed personality with respect to her former acting career. I liked the idea that there were a lot of characters in the film that were played by actual people who worked during the silent film era. It really contributed to the verisimilitude of the film.

The film makers really hyperbolized each of the characters most prominent traits, such as Normas batty behavior and Betty's soft, aspiring personality. I think this type of scripting brought the film to life and made up for the lack of colour.

I know there's nothing new to say about Billy Wilder's classic \u2013 its camp sharpness, its haunting Gothic melancholy, its rich, dark comedy, its insidiously fascinating characters \u2013 so I won't try. What struck me was recognising Wilder as a genius director. Often seen as a writer who favoured the screenplay more than visual elements, in this movie he really showed some innovative insight into framing his masterpiece. Two, in particular, stand out \u2013 the fish eye view of the body in the swimming pool and use of powder on the edges of the camera lenses. I also enjoyed the commentary into the music of the film. When I watched the film again, I had a new appreciation for Franz Waxman's score.",

            "content": "There are three reasons why I love this movie: Billy Wilder, Gloria Swanson, and black and white photography.  Don't misunderstand me, I love the other actors (Holden is his usual solid self)in this film, but Swanson's performance has to be one of the small handful of all-time great performances by a leading actress (my other favorites are Meryl Streep in Sophie's Choice, Bette Davis in All About Eve, and Katherine Hepburn in The Lion In Winter).  Unfortunately for Swanson, All About Eve was released in the same year, so Swanson and Davis cancelled each other out and Judy Holliday stole the Oscar for Born Yesterday, one of the All-time Oscar travesties.  Swanson puts it all out there for us in this film, and we all get to just eat it up.  She's nothing short of mesmerizing in this film...just try not to pay attention to her and you'll see what an act of futility that is.Wilder?  Quite simply, he's my favorite director of all time, and this may well be his best work.  Eight Oscar nominations for Best Director! What's even more amazing is that he was nominated twelve (that's right, twelve) times for Best Screenplay!  How many contemporary directors also write their own work?  I don't mean to disparage modern directors; on the contrary, I don't expect directors to write the story as well as tell it, but that's what made Wilder so special.  His works include Some Like It Hot, The Lost Weekend, Stalag 17, Sabrina, The Apartment, Double Indemnity, and Witness For The Prosecution.  Counting Sunset Boulevard, Wilder has six films in imdb's Top 250, with none of those lower than 170.  That's one hell of a resume folks!Finally, the photography.  If anyone ever remakes this film, shame on them. Not only does this film HAVE to be in black and white, but it's just impossible to imagine improving on the way it is filmed.  Rarely have I watched a movie and gotten the creeps just from the atmosphere of an old house, but this film does it to me every time, and I've seen it several times!  For William Holden, this house becomes something of a prison, and just getting out of it means everything to him.  We the audience come to feel the same way.A great, great film, one of the best ever.  Check it out and enjoy!",

I guess it was extremely unsettling to me to see Gillis becoming dependent on the riches of such a painfully fragile yet egotistical woman. To say the least, it was just uncomfortable to observe the path that Gillis was taking himself through - he had a much more promising future working with Schaffer. Yes, he may have been close to drowning in Desmond's wealth, and could (maybe) have a shot at potentially enhancing her mediocre scripts to fit the likings of the people at Paramount, thus earning him a (very) dependant living. But did he really want that? I don't particularly think so. I feel like he was almost accepting his \"fate\" with a sort of resentment. Because he felt like he didn't really have a choice, because he thought he had a shot with giving her reputation a face lift. Eventually I'm pretty sure he started to realize that he couldn't stay with this lady anymore, that he needed to turn his life around and go back, find his own friends his own age, working with people his own age.\nI think Schaffer alluded to many opportunities and chances Gillis could take to work with her, such as when Gillis had enough of Desmond and decided back to his friend Green to inquire on whether or not Green could give him a few nights at his place. Then he was subsequently informed by Schaefer that she believed one of his scripts had potential - and was almost abruptly turned down in return when he declined. Or when Mayerling divulged to him the nearly unfathomable fact that it was in fact he who was really writing and sending the fan mail to Desmond. Because clearly no one found much taste in her work anymore. And her fame was vanishing. Fast.\nI feel like the entire time he was almost battling an inner doubt within him - to find wealth and work with a seemingly crazed older lady with a fragile ego, or sign a deal with Schaffer who comprehended that his work had potential. I feel like he was in a way not really sure what he was getting himself into in the first place - he was $300 in debt, no one would lend him anything, and he started to develop mutual relations with this old woman. The ending was almost scary to me. He completely lost his chances with Schaffer. It was like his double life was seriously messing with his thinking too. The second Desmond revealed the firearm, I was 99.9% sure he wasn't leaving the estate alive (the 0.01% I was reserving for a miracle. I mean, you never know with this woman who seemed dazed to the point of becoming schizophrenic-like at the final ending shot). Somehow when she was following him with the gun I still hadn't connected the dots to the shot at the start with the dead body in the pool. But then, yes - it all made sense in a landslide.\nOverall, if the film was meant to be perceived as unsatisfying/settling to their primary audiences, well it worked for me.",

While avoiding the repo man Jo make a left turn into a situation he will never forget.  The driveway he turns into is none other than the famous silent screen diva Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) who lives in an amazing decrepit Hollywood mansion. Norma Desmond is a once famous movie star who is having problems facing the reality that stardom is no longer part of her life. Norma has been working on a script for a movie that would star her as the lead character propelling her back into her superstar status. Norma hires Jo to refine the script housing him conveniently above the garage. Jo being broke cannot refuse the offer. When water damage forces Jo to move into the main house Jo becomes more tangled in the web of the temptress Norma.  Jo becomes a kept man receiving expensive clothes and trinkets from Norma and loses touch with his life as a budding screenwriter. Opportunities for romance are faltered by the meldding Norma with Jo getting fed up with it all wanting to return to Ohio but he does not make it. Norma gets her final close-up from the news reporters who engulf her mansion to capture footage of the once famous movie star turned murderer.The film begins with Jo doing a dead mans float literally, reflecting on what went wrong with his interactions with Norma Desmond. This film is classified as a Film Noir and Gloria Swanson's performance creates an eerie feeling anywhere in or around her mansion that complements her creepy character. The audience can tell Gloria's character has a few screws loose and the anticipation for something bad to happen is apparent throughout the film especially because you know Jo is killed at one point in the film.One of the things I liked the most about this film is the gaudy limo that Norma and Jo are driven around in by Max (Erich Von Stroheim) the butler. The limo is an imported hand made monstrosity that has leopard skin seats. Norma and Jo are driven around like royalty in this limo while people are pointing and laughing at the sheer site of the limo. The funny thing about Max the butler is that he is the director that found Norma as an actress and has accepted a menial job just to be around her.  Max is really creepy and seems to being always lurking around the mansion observing what is going on. Some significant facts about this film are for one the film deviated from the classical Hollywood mold of film making while pointing out what happens to stars that are no longer wanted by film makers and the movie viewing public exemplifying the myth of the Hollywood life. Norma Desmond is a delusional actress that has been used up and no longer needed by the Hollywood film makers. Hollywood did not like the way this idea was portrayed and only time could give the credit due for this film. Gloria Swanson was actually a silent movie start in the 20's and was making a comeback starring in Sunset Blvd. The friends that come to play bridge with Gloria's character were also silent film stars. The butler Max Von Mayerling (Erich Von Stroheim) was actually a prominent silent film director.",

This is the only film I have ever seen of hers and she is so amazing. The character of Norma Desmond is one of a somewhat forgotten actress of the silent era who believes it is time for her great comeback to the silver screen. There is one problem though, she is a loon. Outright over the top whack job who obsesses on her career. Swamson is over the top. Very believable at times and as well, very laughable. There is a movie out there called The Forbidden Zone from early 1980's. The actress Susan Tyrell portrays a character very similar to the Desmond role, even in her facial expressions.

Sunset Boulevard is one of these movies; it has a great balance of not only being significant with its commentary on old Hollywood, but also being entertaining. There are many parts to this movie that contributes to its joy factor, my favorites are how dark this film turns out to be along with its character performances.Many classic films that I know of have a predisposition to be slightly comical and lighthearted, primarily because of the \"overacting\" and probably just due to how people looked at film back in the day. Sunset Boulevard is dark; drama is not merely a tool for storytelling or showcasing of talent and personal relationships are not touched on the same way modern drama films usually do so. The character archetypes are developed throughout the film are done in away that makes all the mystery and suspense so easy to become invested in. This is where my other favorite part of the film comes in: the actors/characters.Dramatic acting in old films is always so fun to watch. It's a craft that seems to have influenced a large part of acting seen in modern films but also can't be replicated due to their novelty. In Sunset Boulevard, the talent frontline consists of actors William Holden and Gloria Swanson. It's so easy to become enraptured by the performances these two give; Swanson's dramatic overacting is so entertainingly outlandish but also gathers meaning over time and Holden really knows how to portray emotions without verbalizing them while also giving some great little monologues here and there.Sunset Boulevard has been called \"a movie about movies\" with its commentary on the perceptions and misconceptions of Hollywood back then. Billy Wilder, the director of this film, came under a bit of fire for going this direction with this story. I think I can relate to most fans when I say that his efforts in portraying Hollywood and the film industry as a whole in such a different light has gained my utmost respect and gratitude, as I also found this film to be a very enjoyable experience.",

How many great silent actresses became forgotten as they aged? And actors too, for that matter? A couple of silent screen superstars were asked if they wanted the role of Norma Desmond before Gloria Swanson snatched it up, but none were as good actresses to fit Norma's mad and wild personality. The film was shot in black and white in an era where Technicolor was taking over, but such a movie wouldn't be the same in color. Color is so bright and cheery, and Sunset Boulevard is a dark, even slightly frightening story.The story is as follows: down-and-out screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden) can't pay up debt on his car, so he hides it in a garage. The garage turns out to be part of an elephantine mansion belonging to aging silent screen star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson). She wants him to work on a long and tedious script she's been working on for her screen \"return.\" But when her beloved Paramount studios calls her up, they don't want her to be in one of their movies-they want to rent her car for a few weeks for a movie. And when Norma finds that out, the insanity is indescribable. The mentions of real-life silent stars makes you shiver: Wallace Reid, Pearl White, Mabel Normand, John Gilbert, Rudolph Valentino, Vilma Banky, Rod la Rocque. It makes you think how far 1950 really is from 1929 and the years prior to it. Everyone should see this film, especially fans of silent movies.

            "content": "Quite simply, one of the sharpest screenplays ever written and luckily it has performances to match.ASome people have points they argue about this movie. Why did Joe stick around for so long ? He was a shallow guy, he wanted the meal ticket that he was being offered and, yes, despite his disgust at the offerings he always ended up taking them. Why did he end up back with Norma on that fateful night after her suicide attempt ? Because he was too scared, he didn't want to feel responsible for anyone else's pain. If he'd never actually heard of Norma's fate then he would have been long gone but once it was relayed to him, and still with the fresh memory of the part he played, then he had to make sure that he hadn't done any long-term damage. Joe enjoyed making a buck but he wasn't a completely uncaring man.As for Norma Desmond herself, she may well be the single greatest human character ever to be thrown onto celluloid. Half Quasimodo, half Bride Of Frankenstein and . . . . . . ummmm . . . . half Dracula's Daughter. Gloria Swanson bravely plays the faded movie star with a perfect mix of sadness, fiery anger, intense narcissism and pride, all mixed up with some mild overacting and permanent melodrama.William Holden is the coolest narrator ever and his character, although often unlikeable, just about keeps us onside for the duration of the movie. Even if writer/director Billy Wilder doesn't manage to keep our sympathies with the right character for most of the movie he produces some scenes in the second half that give Holden's character a twisted redemption and reason to finally make a completely clean breast of things.Max, the butler, IS the avid fan taken to the extreme. Devoted, adoring, ever-present, he's the perfect audience member and just what Norma Desmond needs to keep her sanity for as long as she does. Does he actually help her or is he ultimately responsible for her fall over the edge ? Max or Joe, who is the bigger culprit ? An interesting question that I'm not sure I could easily answer.Of course, many other people also help to keep Norma from the truth. Cecil B DeMille, her card-playing buddies, even security guards still working at the studio. If more people had reacted the same way as Joe did initially (dismissing Norma and prompting her reply of \"I AM big, it's the pictures that got small\") then maybe she would have eased back down to earth. If her ego and vanity would have EVER allowed it.The only real innocent character in the movie, the only one who doesn't help to perpetuate any fantasy and who doesn't act for purely personal gain, is Betty Schaffer. It is poor Betty who is quickly drawn in, chewed up and spat out by Holden's character (hmmmm . . . a writer responsible for breaking the heart of a young, up and coming lady . . . . surely not).I love this movie with all my being. I love the faded, preserved shrine that is Norma Desmond's house. The car and the swimming pool being returned to working order, just as Norma herself is, for the benefit of Joe. Are we watching Gloria Swanson playing Norma Desmond throughout this film or are we watching an older actress play every idol that we've ever discarded ? Is the movie disturbing because of the interplay of the characters or because we, as an audience, do not want to venture into this world of forgotten stars and empty theatres ? Am I reading too much into this film ? Maybe I am and maybe I don't care. Just see it and love it.",

(Too bad All About Eve) William Holden has never been more valiant and Gloria Swanson is beautifully cast as the aging actress. And has there been anyone as creepy as Erich Von Stroheim in a movie since? The answer is no! It is brilliant because it adds suspense, love, hate, allusion, and foreshadowing all together in less than two hours. I just wish that there were still movies made like this gem today. There are, of course, great movies still being made (Mostly by Scorsese and Eastwood), but this classic is will forever be one of the greatest ever filmed!",

However, until the audience gets to the end, they are given some clues to what kind of a woman this \"Madame\" is. She is a worn out star who is 50 and lives alone in a house which reminds us of Ms.Havisham from Charles Dickens' \"Great Expectations\". This bit of comparison is actually made by the narrator of the movie who is also one of the main characters, who is also Madame's platonic crush.The movie actually starts off with a death scene and then is narrated by the victim himself. Then goes back 6 months and is oddly narrated by the dead character. Joe is a writer in Hollywood who is after his Hollywood dream. However, he has realized that it is just a dream for him unlike Betty who is a script reader who has a passion for her job and later for Joe. They start working on a script together while Joe is in a complicated relationship with Madame. Things get tragic in the end because the movie ends in a traumatic way for Betty and Joe. Madame on the other hand, is just starting her own movie which Max is directing for her.This movie does the justice of putting a few smiles on the viewers face. In fact, in the end when you feel like you should be crying, you end up smiling because of the ridiculous feelings Madame and Max make you go through.So if you would like to see a fake movie within a real movie then this 1950s wonder is the right \"picture\" for you.",

A dark, twisted and subtle film set in Hollywood.\nSunset Boulevard depicts a very refreshingly realistic view on Hollywood stars and the film industry. Although it is brutally honest, I fully appreciate that it brings the attention away from romanticizing Hollywood as it is often done in films we see today. This film successfully shows the point of view of a hustling screenplay writer and a forgotten actress.Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) is a mentally ill, somewhat self-obsessed, retired and tragically forgotten Hollywood actress with an eccentric personality that intrigues the audience throughout the whole film. Norma carried us through the whole film only showing very small parts of her madness. Right at the end, when the timing was right, she drew the audience in with a full-blown meltdown. This was possibly my favorite scene - grand and bold. The audience had been waiting for her to crack fully and when she did, I was absolutely satisfied with the performance. Nancy Olson was okay, but boring. I wanted to like her but she was so mind-numbingly nice and much too dependent on a man then necessary. Joe Gillis was perfect for the role of the screenplay writer. Seemingly, a put together man yet he makes some questionable decisions that kept me guessing.The plot of Sunset Boulevard initially seems relatively simple but throughout the film, Billy Wilder adds in some subtle yet drastic twists. Technically speaking, it was beautifully shot. The cinematography is something I rarely focus on but in Sunset Boulevard it was phenomenal. In the mansion, the use of shadows portrayed the grunge look. The lighting was subtle and created a depth when appropriate.",

Since that focuses primarily on cinematography and sound, I will talk about plot and acting. Joe Gillis, played by William Holden, is our alienated main character who gets caught up in debt with his lenders. Joe finds reprieve from his debtors and his Hollywood apartment when he comes across a deserted mansion belonging to silent film star Norma Desmond, played by Gloria Swanson. Swanson's performance in a word is chilling. Her delivery is purposely melodramatic to play off of her silent film techniques and her outdated conception of films. Her career is essentially dead and Joe's arrival provides an opportunity for her revival. Norma is one of film noir's most famous femme fatales, considering her obsession with Joe causes her to shoot him in the end. In the aftermath, Norma's delusions about her resurgence in film causes her to think the reporters crowding her estate are cameramen filming a scene for a new film. Norma's delusional perceptions of her own reality lead to her own demise and Joe's faith in her delusions led to his demise. The wisest character is undoubtedly Max, Norma's servant who keeps her satisfied by fueling the delusions and preserving her delicate feelings. Overall, this is a must watch film for any movie lover. The cinematography is very precise and well executed and the use of sound is specific.",

I would recommend this film for anyone who is a fan of the actors/actresses in this film (such as Gloria Swanson, William Holden, Nancy Olson, and Buster Keaton just to name a few), and the overall story of showing an old star dive into insanity because of losing fame.",

What I will do here is to write about the story and ask myself what did i enjoy it. Well let's start in the beginning where the police find the dead body in the pool. Like many other movies I've seen the voice over narration really pulls you right into the story. Not only that but the black and white makes it a gorgeous film to look at. So right in the beginning you know this is a well crafted story. \n This is the oldest movie i seen that uses the technique of showing you the death of a character and later rewind back and show you how they got to that point. But it felt right for the movie.  Joe Gillis is a poor screenwriter trying to make into hollywood. He does not have the means to sustain his vehicle. They are people who are trying to repossess his vehicle and so he tries bypass them by hiding in what looks like in abandoned mansion. But soon we realize that is not a abandoned mansion but that gloria Swanson lives there, a old Hollywood actresses in the silent era who longs to work in cinema again but is no longer relevant to the new era. There Joe Gillis starts working on her script that is full of silent era technique and consider to be a bad script. While living there for free Gloria Swanson become attached and Seemingly falls in love with him joe Gillis. The problem is that Joe Gillis does not share same feeling and therefore start to feel trapped in the life. The dilemma: He then must make a decision to be with Swanson and her lavish life but deal with her delusional fame and her fall to grace as a Hollywood actress or escape with a young screenwriter who is young and pretty but has nothing to offer for a stable career. The movie pacing is excellent . first we start caring for joe because he is broke and needs money. Then later we get interested in the life of Gloria Swanson and little by little we figure out the possessive character she is. That adds more drama for Joe because we see how unhappy he really is. This add more drama when he decides to leave at night and see another women. Until the final showdown where gloria goes to the extreme to stop joe from leaving.  Norma Desmond acting as Gloria Swanson was outstanding and exquisite, she stole the show and is deserving of my full admiration. Her role as a fall to grace Hollywood star was believe and we pitied her from the moment we realize that paramount did not want her up until she kills Joe and we see her outbreak to insanity. The scenes were she is preparing herself for the comeback to Hollywood really did hurt my soul. And of course that ending. When she steps foot descending from her bedroom to her destiny as criminal. The lights were switched on, the cameras were rolling and she was in front of the camera for the very last time. The euphoria that she felt in being that Hollywood star.  Grade: A",

The movie was cynical, or maybe that's just the way I am perceiving it.The performance of Gloria Swanson was wonderful. She was convincing in her unstable frame of mind set on returning to the spotlight and stardom. She even makes a comment, \"stars last forever\"(or something like that). She wants to return to the spotlight and make a comeback and be loved. Probably best shown through her obsession of the young guy who she \"held captive\" and how she wouldn't let him leave her.Like all film noir, the movie was dark in plot as well as lighting. Our poor hero was sadly killed by his femme fatale who was not all there(mentally) in the beginning the movie.

The themes in this movie are still relevant issues today and that's one of the reasons I believe that this movie is considered timeless. Norma still yearns for the attention that being a movie star brings. She is holding onto her past life and therefore cannot move forward in any other aspect of her being. The movie did make me laugh in parts, at times because of Norma's disillusionment however at the end I just felt sorry for her. Like many people in Hollywood today, their acting careers fizzle out at a certain age unless they reinvent themselves significantly. This often is the case with child stars that then turn to acquire psychological issues or addictions to drugs or alcohol. I also think it is quit sad that her butler and ex husband still lives with her because he loves her. It seems like in this each character is not living but existing in their life.

One of the driving forces of this movie is the actions and behaviors of the former silent screen actress, that ultimately collide with the realities of the changing world.

All of the characters' (Max, Norma, Joe especially) psychological struggles were very fascinating to follow as well. The complexity hiding beneath the surface in this film is captivating.The plot is also odd but relatable in a way; I found the movie to be very applicable.. Not only do some recent movies parallel Sunset Blvd. (like Black Swan), but we can also see ourselves in Norma. As everyone knows, it is incredibly difficult to give up a dream you have worked so hard for, and although this film takes it to the extreme, we are warned of the devastating effects of a close mind not willing to see the greater picture.

Perhaps it was just too close to home. (The life of Libby Holman would itself make a fascinating film)\nAccording to rumor the picture was actually based on the life of Corinne Griffith, one of the most beautiful women in silent pictures, who was also a real estate expert. When Norma Desmond states \"I own three blocks downtown,\" that was Corinne speaking - she did own three blocks in Beverly Hills.\nWilder and Brackett had been working on the script for some years when it finally jelled.

The way it shows Hollywood as a dark place, especially during this time, by using actor or actress for a long time and then they just throw them away like an antique. It also shows that people who work in Hollywood aren't perfect people, everyone looks up to Hollywood like its a glamorous place, but the main character is trying to get away from paying his car bills and then, he also seduces a female screenwriter after she says that she is engaged.

            "content": "I couldn't stand her. I've never saw her in a movie before, but was that all of Gloria Swanson's mannerisms in real life? Bug-eyed, hateful, and horrifying?How could anybody ever find her attractive, even Joseph Kennedy? And I don't mean the fictional Norma Desmond - I mean, Gloria Swanson, the supposedly late great movie star. Was she truly as ugly in person as in the movie?At this point, I wish I could see how Glen Close portrayed Norma Desmond in the musical version. I bet she portrayed her as human - cruel, bombastic, etc., but human. Unlike this Gloria Swanson who was as ugly as the beast Desmond had to bury in a funeral ceremony early on in the story.Every word Swanson uttered was an emotional declamation. I bet if she had had a line that says, \"I am going to brush my teeth,\" it would sound like a warning on the end of the world. Overacting was hardly sufficient to describe her performance. She should have been told that movie goers even in her time were not as dumb as to beat them with her theatricals over the head.Or maybe the trouble was not Swanson herself, but the character Norma Desmond, as disgustingly written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett. If there were any feminists worth their salt out there, it was this denigrating stereotype of cougars and would-be cougars both in the movies and in real life that they ought to protest against.It was the predatory Vivien Leigh's Blanche DuBois, all over again. In A Streetcar Named Desire, DuBois, without regard for her sister Stella's feelings, shamelessly flirted with her younger brother-in-law Stanley Kowalski, played by Marlon Brando, ultimately accusing him of rape.It was, again, the cringy older Anna Magnani's sex-starved and woebegone Lady Torrance in The Fugitive Kind, allowing herself to get pregnant to hold hostage her boy-toy Val, also played by Brando.It was the suicidal Mrs. Stone (Vivien Leigh again!) in The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone, dangerously tossing her apartment's keys to an anonymous stalker, after her boy-toy Paolo (played by Brando wannabe, Warren Beatty) insulted and abandoned her.There are many pathetic examples of cougars in real life, especially among celebrities with descriptions both libelous and barf-inducing, but let me give just one example, the very classless way the young Brando in his autobiography, denigrated the elderly Talulah Bankhead, his co-star in the stage play, \"The Eagle Has Two Heads:\"\"Whenever I was onstage with her and the moment approached when I was supposed to kiss her, I couldn't bear it... Her tongue would explore every cranny in my mouth before forcing itself down my throat... I tried eating a lot of garlic, but that didn't stop her, so I asked a stagehand to buy me a bottle of mouthwash, and after each time I had to kiss her, I went offstage and took a swig, but that didn't work either, so I bought a very strong astringent lotion and began gargling with it in the wings after every kiss.\"Was there ever an older woman-younger man relationship in a play or movie, where the cougar was held in high esteem? Yes, there was. It was Jane Wyman in Magnificent Obsession, with a difference: Rock Hudson was no boy-toy in the movie. He was an honest and ardent younger lover who tried and succeeded on improving himself to be worthy of her love. Wish there were more of that kind of May-December where the woman was the May; if not, at least, the conventional desperate romance between an older woman and a younger man with its share of tenderness and pain, that would not scandalize.Unfortunately, it was not so with Gloria Swanson and William Holden in Sunset Blvd. For one thing, William Holden was a bit too old to be a boy-toy. For another, Swanson just seemed to be the most horrid, most despicable and a more frightful cougar than the examples mentioned above.But how could she have done better? Apparently, that was how the misogynists Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett wrote Norma Desmond. No wonder quite a number of the old silent movie stars declined the part. They felt insulted by the role.According to Wikipedia, Wilder first considered Mae West and Marlon Brando for the leads, but West rejected the offer out-right. West portrayed herself as a sex symbol through her senior years and was offended that she should be asked to play a Hollywood has-been.Greta Garbo and Clara Bow were not interested. Norma Shearer found the script distasteful. Wilder and Brackett then visited Mary Pickford, but before even discussing the plot with her, Wilder realized she would consider a role involving an affair with a man half her age an insult, so they departed.Way to go, late classy ladies!Why four stars? Because everything else in the movie, except the Desmond character, was perfect. The innovative point of view of a dead man telling his story with occasional biting humor; the awesome cinematography and clever use of light and dark, the music score, the story development, the locations and props, the interactions of the supporting cast and fascinating cameos of actual old stars and directors were tops.Furthermore, the handsome William Holden was at his greatest.",

Although at first glance, I admit I assumed it to be over the top or annoying perhaps but I was wrong, Gloria Swanson (famous silent film actress) stepped out of her silent film career to play this more well known role of her career. Surprisingly enough, this film is about Hollywood in the 1950's. William Hollden is a somewhat struggling film writer who ends up meeting Norma (Swanson). The pair make for a humorous yet strange pair throughout the entire film. The black and white film itself creates for an even more intense and certainly dramatic mood, it especially helps to atmosphere of the movie when scenes take place in Norma's gloomy old mansion. Narration throughout the film is in first person from Holden's point of view. The entire thing is a sort of- flashback, as most noirs are. Camera tricks such as fading in and out are used quite often in the film to add to dramatic effect as well. Of course the ending was my favorite part where Norma stares blankly at the screen and says \" Mr. DeVille- i'm ready for my close up.\" I really liked this film a lot.

You could say this film was the beginning of a much darker time for film, and the first time people on the the audience could see that Hollywood was not all good and shiny as they had thought before. While this film might seem exaggerated in the character of Norma Desmond, who becomes literally mad with the idea of her past fame, there is truth in her character. Fame and money are funny things, while they make one seem powerful and beloved, these are the same things that can really bring out the worst in people, as we see in Sunset Blvd.The acting throughout the film is especially superb, I was really impressed with Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond. I feel like her character would be such a hard one to play, but from the way she spoke to her gestures, I really believed she was a narcissistic actress who was indeed mad. William Holden (Joe Gillis) was also perfect for his role, as he plays a man who really hasn't had much success in following his dream, but he tries nonetheless. His character has a good amount of humour for a not so light film, and the way he acts tells us that he really is a good person. Betty Schaefer, played by Nancy Olson I think is the impersonation of innocence, naiveness and goodness in an industry where those characteristics are rarely seen. She helps lighten the film and gives us hope that Joe can come out of the situation he has found himself in with Norma Desmond.This was one of the first, if not the first to use a non-linear storyline in a film, and it fits perfectly. The technicalities of this beginning sequence are also amazing, as they didn't use an underwater to film the body, instead they used a mirror to reflect, and that's how we see Joe's body. It was also shot in such a way that it was not really revealed this was Joe until the very end. This would later set the stage for other films, especially with a dark theme to use this form of storytelling; some of these are Pulp Fiction, Fight Club and 12 Monkeys.I really enjoyed this film, overall everything was great, and it was a really creative story that showed a darker side of something that people had generally thought was all fun and good. The way Cecil B. DeMille plays Norma's butler, and how he has \"protected her from the world\" by allowing for her to think that she is still relevant was simply great. The last bit of the film was perfect. Joe believes he is tainted, instead of leaving with Betty as he should have he prefers to let her go to spare her from himself in a way. Norma believed herself so great that she couldn't allow for her to be rejected, so in her rage and jealousy she killed Joe, fully bringing her down through the final steps of madness. I think that the way her butler brought a camera crew for her at the end was a mercy for her that she truly didn't deserve. This movie is a film because it shows what a self centred way of living and fame can do to people and that sometimes things that seem very good, are most likely flawed in a way inside.",

Most definitely a film, (more specifically a film noir) it's dark narratives and 'rounded' story were what brought it to life. I was instantly drawn in by it's classic intro. The unexpected plot was a great refresher and the twist ending was a really smart addition to the narrative.I could honestly write this whole review about Gloria Swanson's performance. She managed to capture a failing artist's final grasp for stardom perfectly. This is because she was one herself. She didn't need to act so much as project. This is what I was most impressed by in Sunset; she chose this over many other roles and offers as her comeback. She found Norma Desmond a captivating character with tons of potential. And although the other acting was equally incredible, Gloria was simply the standout.Something I noticed in this film was that there was no true protagonist. Norma was flawed and toxic, manipulating Joe and everyone she met. She was trapped in the past, unable to forget how forgotten she was. Strangely, Joe was quite similar to Ms. Desmond. He only cared about his work and that he wasn't able to get any. He resented Norma for ruining him, when he had many opportunities to leave. Even in the end when Betty offered to forget everything and run away with him, he refused only to complain about it later. Because if this, he later met his demise, bringing Norma with him. I found myself unsure of who to root for, hating both Joe and Norma's actions throughout. Their chemistry was scarces and their failure in life was brought forward by the other.Sunset Boulevard was a jumping off point for films today, i.e Brick and Pulp Fiction. They are able to address dark topics and mimic the shots and cuts of the classics. Pulp Fiction mimics angles and takes influence from film noirs like Kiss Me Deadly. Primarily, they use the 'rounded' story to give their films an edge. They start with the end, before returning to the beginning to show you how we get to that point. This is able to capture your attention while confusing and drawing audiences in.\nSunset was the perfect starting point. They were able to convince us that the man dead in the pool had nothing to do with our main character, Joe. But as we continue, we learn that this man is in fact Joe. It's a smart way to shock your viewers and compel them. Overall, an intriguing film that delves into Hollywood's effect on their craftsmen, how desperate some are for stardom and how long and hard the fall from the top really is.",

            "content": "Foe my \"History of American Cinema\" class, I had to watch a movie under the genre of film noir. The movie I chose to watch was, \"Sunset Blvd.,\" directed by Bill Wilder and released to the public in 1950. Film noir movies have an overall mood of pessimism, fatalism, or menace. I think this film had a strong mood of pessimism. This film had a very cynical view of Hollywood(especially during the 1950's), the plot line's message was how Hollywood makes people famous, then dumps them when they are no longer needed. The script is very clean, clever, and witty. There were a variety of camera angels, with clean transitions. I also enjoyed the element of romance throughout the film. The actors really embraced their characters and brought the script to life and made you feel emotional throughout the movie, because it seemed so realistic, and like these were real people going through hard times. The movie was shot beautifully in black and white, and gave off a very gloomy vibe. I really enjoyed this film and think it deserves all the success, because it is an interesting movie and makes you feel emotional involved. I recommend this movie to someone would wants to see a Hollywood film noir classic.",

            "content": "Sunset Blvd. is the gloomy tale of failing screenwriter Joe Gillis (William Holden). Right from the beginning you know his story is doomed to end in tragedy when we see his body lifelessly floating in a pool. It sets the tone for darker things to come, we are following around a dead man.Joe Gillis, an aspiring screenwriter with a couple of features to his name, can't seem to catch a break. He has no money, no one can give him a job and even his agent leaves him. Whilst on the run from creditors he ends up at, what looks like, a deserted mansion. To our shock we learn the mansion is actually inhabited by forgotten silent moviestar Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her loyal servant Max (Erich von Stroheim). Norma, clearly insane, can't accept the fact that she has faded away and spents her time in the illusion that she is still the biggest star of them all. Joe becomes entangled in her fantasy and agrees to help rewrite Norma's story, for which she has high hopes of sparking her glorious comeback.Gloria Swanson sparkles in one of the best acting performances of all time. Always on the brink of mental breakdown, never truly reaching it until the end.\nJoe, who finally has enough of her drifts of melancholy and insanity, desides to leave her. Him leaving her puts her over the edge. \"No one ever leaves a star.\" Norma says \"Thats what makes one a star.\", and both Joe and the viewer know she has now completely lost touch with reality. In one of the most memorable endings in cinematic history we see Norma descends down the staircase. It is as if she is reaching out to the audience in one last attempt of regaining her glory. \"You see this is my life, it always will be! There's nothing else, just us and the cameras, and those wonderful people out there in the dark.\"Billy Wilder masterfully directs the movie, combining satire and tragedy to create the ultimate Hollywood horror story. A case study of what fame can do to people and the coldness of Hollywood. It shows us the illusions that come with stardom even though we are supposed to see through them.",

            "content": "Sunset Boulevard set the style for epic Film-Noir movies everywhere. It inspired graphic novel writer/artist Frank Miller the creator of Sin City. It inspired the writing and screenplays of Christopher and Jonathan Nolan the brothers behind the movies The Prestiege, Memento, Batman Begins and the Following. It inspired most of the film-noir/ comic book crime genre that has evolved from it. This movie was the beginning of a beautiful friendship.It was a great story told threw the narration of Joe Gillis as William Holden whom was the main star of the film. It was basically him a washed up B screenwriter trying to make some money running into a famous actress who decides to give him a job Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond. In end it develops a chain of events that makes Norma obsessed over William.Nothing really surprising about the film everything could be well predicted its just the dialog and acting that would flow to that point would tie you up to your seat handcuff your hands to the back and open up your eyes with clips Clockwork Orange style. It was a amazing film for semi-dark/mystery lovers who don't care for twists but rather just have a nice flowing plot with a satisfiable ending.The ending was decent but since you knew what was going to happen from the start of the movie it took away from it a tad. It was still a bit surprising however to the turn of events afterward but the lunacy of the acting from Gloria Swanson at the end took away from the flick in my opinion. Some may argue it was perfect others may say it was terrible, it was really a love it or hate it scene that I believe could have been done better. I just believe that she had better moments threw out the film.It was definitely a classic tale with near perfect dialog that inspired some of our industry greats. In end if your even remotely interested in the genre of Film-noir then don't keep strangling yourself with garbage and watch this film.",

The fact that a woman was taking the patriarcal role in the relationship by providing the ressources must have been groundbreaking for 1950, but anyways.

She finds her way back into the spotlight when she meets a young screenwriter and she thinks she is cured but doesn't realize that she is slowly fading deeper into insanity.2)The Director: Billy Wilder's ingenious direction is what practically makes this film. His intricate eye to detail is one of the things that makes this film a success.3)The Stars: Gloria Swanson, William Holden, Nancy Olsen, and Eric von Stroheim are the people that make this film what is today: a classic. Gloria Swansons stunning performance as Norma Desmond truly deserved the recognition that it received. I think her performance is the greatest of all time and was totally robbed of the Oscar for Best Actress.All in all, this my favorite movie and it is one of greatest films ever made.(P.S.

In what is arguably his greatest film, Sunset Boulevard takes on the dream machine that is Hollywood, and succeeds in providing a scathing, haunting and bleakly humorous film that will remain timeless, as long as films continue to exist.Bare witness to a simply stunning and equally disturbing performance from Gloria Swanson as film star Norma Desmond, whose fame and popularity faded into obscurity during the arrival of 'sound' films. William Holden plays struggling screenwriter Joe Gillis. Gillis, who seriously considers giving up Hollywood and returning to his hometown in Ohio, ends up in Desmond's fantasy world and its dangerous consequences.Wilder, who also co-wrote the film, slowly and meticulously deconstructs the Hollywood dream by creating detailed and developed characters, a whole historical background behind them and the famous locations of Tinseltown for the viewer to immerse themselves into. Beautifully directed, with a range of amazing visual shots, the world portrayed on screen gradually becomes more sinister as Norma Desmond's mental state goes from fantastical and theatrical to terrifying and dangerous.More than a film noir, more than a psychological drama, more than a bleak and bitter black comedy, Sunset Boulevard is rightly a highly placed work of art. Along with David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, this film continues to stun me with its savage analysis of a town obsessed with fame, fortune and immortality, and the darkness behind it all.",

William Holden, whom I've seen in other roles (Network and The Wild Bunch) plays a writer who is sort of weary and is muted in his actions and reactions. What may seem to be wooden in his approach is actually a wonderful characterization of a weary, beaten writer by Mr. Holden. In contrast, Gloria Swanson plays a very theatrical aging movie star, \"Nora Desmond.\" Actually a former silent film star who just can not let go of her past and her former popularity. She lives, almost as a recluse, in her mansion - a safety bubble of her old studio days.Desmond hires Holden's character to write a screenplay, so that she can make a major comeback. And he succumbs to her wishes, because he is down on his luck (and on the run from creditors).None of the great elements described would have worked without the absolutely wonderful direction by Billy WIlder. Mr. WIlder knows how to tell a story without letting \"direction\" or the camera get in the way, and he is wonderful with his actors. Mr. WIlder is helped greatly by a very fine screenplay by Charles Brackett, D. M. Marshman Jr and Wilder, himself.Special mention should be given to the art direction.

At the time she was offered the role, she was very busy (thank you very much) in New York with, among other things, pioneering early live television. She had a very busy family and social life, and wasn't that keen on returning to California and the silver screen. She was, however, very intrigued with the script, and was talked into it by Wilder. When she got to the coast and began to make contact with some of her old friends from the silent days, she was very disturbed and a little freaked out to discover that there were indeed many \"Norma\" cases hidden in the Bel Air hills. She was shocked to find many of her old acquaintances were stuck in the past, where as she had moved on and never looked back. She then actively sought out these people and began studying them, incorporating parts of each of them into her portrayal of Norma Desmond.A couple of interesting stories about the making of this movie are worth relating. In 1948, Billy Wilder and his collaborator, Charles Brackett were searching for story ideas. They were lunching at Chasens restaurant in Beverly Hills and Wilder noticed an aged, apparently \"homeless\" man hovering around C.B. Demille's table. Wilder observed DeMille motioning the old bum over and whispering something to him. The bum shuffled out. Intrigued, Wilder filed the incident away. Several days later he ran into De Mille on the Paramount lot and asked about it. \"Oh yes, that was old Griffith asking for work again.\" Aghast, Wilder asked \"Griffith \u0085WHO?\" \"D.W. Griffith\" Demille simply replied, and walked away. It so shocked Wilder that such a titan of the film industry could become such a severe has\u0096been, could have fallen so low. It gave him and Brackett the germ of the idea that eventually became \"Sunset Blvd\"-the true, unvarnished look at how Hollywood treats its \"living legends\".Another interesting story occurred at the films Hollywood premi\u00e8re. It was, of course a huge, star-studded affair. Everyone who was anyone was there. After the screening, L.B. Mayer, then recently deposed head of MGM and one of the most powerful of all movie moguls stormed into the lobby. Billy Wilder was there, holding court, and enjoying praise from all. \"You muckraking scum! You've ruined this town with this filthy picture! You and your kind are ruining our industry!\" Mayer barked in Wilder's face. Wilder, with an ever so faint smirk on his face clucked his tongue and said \"Go f@ck yourself\"",

But I was wrong, Sunset Blvd was actually a very easy to watch movie, it did not have an overly complicated plot. As soon as the movie began my eyes were glued to the television and my brain easily absorbed every single detail of the plot. What I also liked about it was that they kept it to a nice length, only 1 hour 50 minutes long. A similar film that I recently watched is All About Eve, which ran for 2 hours and 20 minutes, I felt that was a bit too long and they dragged out much longer than they should have. Sunset Blvd went by at a much more pleasant pace. In other words there was never a moment in which I zoned out. The characters in it were unique and intriguing. But what I liked most of all about the film was the screenplay, which is slightly ironic given that the film is from the point of view of a screenwriter. The one liners that the characters come out with are so artistically, smooth and poetic. This type of film writing is an art that has been lost in todays making of pictures. The acting performances was some of the best I've witnessed in a while, especially from Gloria Swanson. How she didn't win an Oscar for it I do not know. One thing I will say is that if you're not a fan of old fashioned films in general then you may not enjoy it because after all the film is in black and white and was made in the early 1950's. But you never know Sunset Blvd could be the exception.",

            "content": "Sunset Boulevard was an extraordinary film that portrays the afterlife of has-been silent film actress, Norma Desmon, (portrayed by Gloria Swanson; a silent film actress herself) from the perspective of a struggling film writer, Joe Gillis ( portrayed by William Holden). The concept of the film was very unique and set the stage for well-known films such as Pulp Fiction. The film starts at what is actually the end of the film, with a dead man floating face down in a pool. I really like it when films do this because it gives you a taste of what's going to happen. It leaves you wondering.It wasn't until the film was nearing its end that it became clear that Joe Gillis was the dead man in the pool. I'm not sure if that was intentional but I couldn't really make out the face in the pool well enough to make the connection. This certainly didn't affect the outcome of the movie for me. I still enjoyed the surprise. The story itself is really captivating. It paints an interesting picture of Hollywood at the time and the silent film actors who suffered after the addition of sound to movies. Norma Desmond, lives a lonely life of luxury with her ex husband/director turned butler, Max Von Mayerling (portrayed by Erich Von Strohiem; a silent film director of his time). Buster Keaton, Hedda Hopper and Anna Q. Nilsson (portraying themselves) make a ghostly cameo at one of Norma Desond's card games, enjoying get together with old silent film pals. For some of those actors, it was their first role in forever, despite being beloved by millions on the silent film screens of the past. The choice to cast silent film actors and directors really helps convey the story director Billy Wilder is trying to tell. The film was a really enjoyable watch. The story was compelling and heartbreaking and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in a tragic tale of struggling artists.",

It also makes a powerful statement about the myth of the so called good old days.William Holden is excellent as a struggling writer who finds himself trapped by an ageing silent movie star. His performance in this film is the best next to Bridge On The River Kwai and Network.Mr. Holden who plays the unemployed writer, does a good job telling his story throughout the film.For Gloria Swanson as Norma Desmond, what a great comeback in a role, that at the time any actress would have given there eyeteeth to play.Two of the best highlights in this movie, is the cameo from Cecil B. DeMille, who unlike Norma Desmond, does not live or reminisce about the so called good old days. He has moved with the times, plus he has become an older respected figure in modern day Hollywood.The second highlight is the clever writing of the screenplay which was co-written by Billy Wilder.I recommend this film for movie buffs And tickled pink.",

I also liked the complex plot of the movie, as well as how the story untied over time. The introduction had a pretty strong impression, and getting to know the behind story of it was very interesting for me. I thought using the imagery of old and young throughout the plot had a great influence in the progress of the story, both in the characters and the plot. Overall, I was very satisfied with this film.

            "content": "Sunset Boulevard is a classic. In 1950 when it was released, not everyone was thrilled - especially the head of MGM, Louis B. Mayer. He was upset at its dark portrayal of the inside of Hollywood. But he was in the minority. Luckily for us no one was able to stop the public from seeing the picture. It is one of the best movies made by director Billy Wilder and features former silent film stars, fresh faces, directors in acting roles, Hedda Hopper as herself, Jack Webb years before Dragnet fame, and a young William Holden in the lead. But the most amazing performance, by far, has to be the one given by Gloria Swanson - exceedingly dark and creepy! Funny, but she is playing sort of a version of herself - an aging, and largely forgotten star of silent films making comeback. Together, Swanson and Wilder create a character - Norma Desmond - who is equally bizarre and unforgettable. According to the documentary on the special edition DVD, Mae West and Mary Pickford, among others, were considered for, or offered the role of Norma before George Cukor suggested Swanson to Wilder over a casual lunch. Seeing the movie now, who would ever guess that she wasn't the first choice? There's no way the movie would be the treasure it is today without Swanson.The script is also top-notch with many memorable lines, none more so than the final one when Norma Desmond says: All right Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up.*SPOILER*After shooting Joe (Holden) as he tries to leave her, Desmond utters another classic: No one ever leaves a star. And my favorite is this exchange: Joe: Hey, you're Norma Desmond. You used to be big. Norma: I'm still big! It's the pictures that got small. *SPOILER*The whole movie is seen through a flashback, narrated by the already-dead-and-floating-face-down-in-the-swimming-pool Joe. Our first view of him is from the bottom of the pool looking up into his face, with the police and photographers gathered at the side of the pool about to fish him out. A shot that could be easily recreated today - but not in 1950. To simulate the view from below, the cinematographer had to place a mirror in the pool and shoot from above the water level to capture the images that Wilder wanted. It's very effective - a creepy way to start a very creepy movie.",

However, I found it a little difficult to get invested in the film since neither of the main characters seemed particularly sympathetic to me.

I absolutely loved the expressiveness of Gloria Swanson (but since she was a famous silent movie actress I couldn't expect less than that). I am happy with the final: him not leaving when Betty asks him so is what males this movie \"realistic\".\nWe all hope love to triumph, justice to be made and the manipulators to lose, but in my opinion this movie wouldn't have been a classic if Joe had left with Betty. He made too many mistakes and lost his chances of saving himself, but instead he always preferred to keep living the way he was. At the end, his destiny was already sealed and deep down he knew what was gonna eventually happen.\nGreat movie, I enjoyed watching it and I recommend to watch it",

Marshall Jr, decided to change this ongoing struggle, creating an absolute masterpiece that would soon change the film scene forever.The images of the black and white sceneries are quite fascinating and unforgettable. The beginning of this film noir is in my opinion, one of the greatest openers to a film of all time. As the eerie quiet piano music plays in the back, the creepy, sinister narration creates a whole world questioning what happened to this dead body laying in the pool. The open eyes of the writer stares right into your soul, as you are excited to see what's next, but also confused to see why this is the beginning of the movie. I think this style of film making is the best because for me, I tend to lose my train of thought and get bored with long movies, but like this film noir, and some Tarantino films. The scene at the beginning of this film just keeps me on the edge of my seat the whole time.Sunset Blvd. is one of the finest Films ever made This has everything, dark humour, suspense, fantastic acting, flawless cinematography, and overall this is just a must-see for all movie lovers.",

Sunset Blvd is definitely a film because of the way it teaches you about the film industry back then and how people were treated. This film does a great job on showing how money isn't everything in life because of how William Holden lied to Norma Desmond about his life and who he was and his income. He did all this just for money and was very happy and thought all his problems had gone away but later in the movie he would find himself bored and unhappy even though he was very rich and had no financial problems. He then had an affair and was offered any amount of money but he left without any valuables or money and just wanted to go back to his old job and not be rich but be happy.",

Sunset Blvd is one of the most classic film noirs as it was made in the 50's, and film noirs became popular only a few years prior (40s.) This movie really influenced all of film for the following years. I enjoyed this movie, but the backstory to it and all the little random things I learned about it while reading articles made me like it even more. For example, one of the main characters Norma Desmond is played by Gloria Swanson who herself is a very well known silent film actress. It was her come back into the film word after many years and plenty movie opportunities offered to her. Knowing things like that about the movie (there are much more) make me more interested and impressed by the film.I liked this film a lot as its a heart-wrenching, soft yet intense story. It starts out with the classic film noir style.... A shot of main character Joe Gillis (played by William Holden) laying lifeless face down in a pool. It shocks you, and leaves you wanting more. I really enjoy this style of movie as I'm someone who has a very short attention span, meaning movies and films are sometimes hard for me to stay watching, but in this case I was intrigued a minute into the movie and stayed intrigued. I consider this production a film, as I can tell the creators of this movie made it with care and dedication, and not just to please the public. Also, this movie was way ahead of its time as I genuinely had no idea that it was made in the 50's until after the movie. It's incredibly well done for it's time, and gave a great example for the film industry. a lot of films and movies we know today wouldn't be the same without this film.If you consider yourself a film person... you need to watch this movie at least once.",

            "content": "What a wonderful and witty script, filled with cynicism and an immaculate set up of two characters-Joe Gillis and Norma Desmond-who are so different that they perfectly drive each other deeper into each other's hubris. The more I learned about the history of that time, and the wise allegory the film makes so ahead of its time, the more I appreciate this cinematic gem. It's hard to know where to begin. The larger than life settings are awesome in the true sense of the word: from the formidable and grotesque mansion (with more trinkets than those owned by the world's best hoarders), to the real film sets in Paramount Studios, and the humdrum writing office turned into a courting stage filled with spark and excitement. The acting is fantastic, and Gloria Swanson seems to have been born for this part-perhaps her creation of Norma was inspired by her own experience, being a silent film star herself.The intelligent plot and character development brings both Desmond and Gillis to self-destruct, and bury each other further in delusions, while staying entirely convincing throughout. The misery of both of them, and their consequent desperation and need for each other, makes the viewer even more engrossed in the picture and the inevitable fate of the two.There are not enough words to describe the magnificence and precociousness of this film-it simply needs to be experienced and taken in.

It did a good job of the Film Noir style, with the main character not being the 'shiny perfect' guy, instead having flaws and not exactly being the most likeable.

It was easy to follow, the cinematography was pretty good, the soundtrack was fitting, it was overall well made. It was filmed as a movie, I would say, but it is a film. The cinematography may not have been super artsy, and the story may have been simple enough, but it still made me think. It made me wonder: about people, about history, about humanity, and that is what makes it a film. And sure, one could watch it and see it simply as a movie and still be entertained, but to watch it as a film I think is a different experience. To pay attention to the history being told, the historical perspective of the story and it's characters, the underlying human emotions that riddled the story... It makes a huge difference. But it still made me uncomfortable. Norma Desmond made me very uncomfortable as a character. She was desperate and unhinged and messy, and honestly, she was creepy. I didn't like her at all, which I would say means that Gloria Swanson did a fantastic job at making the character seem real. Her emotions were too much, her selfishness was believable and horrible to watch, her dramatics were cringeworthy and awful. I hated it, but I also can appreciate that it means the story was told well. When someone feels as much disdain towards (most of the characters) in this film as I did, then the storytelling is going well. As much as I found this film difficult to watch after a while, I have to say that I was intrigued to how it would end, and that's good when watching a film noir, because the end is the most important part. I think Sunset Boulevard set a strong precedent for the film noirs to follow it. I don't know much about the film noir genre, this is one of two film noirs I've seen in my life, but I have heard it is well known, well appreciated, and historically important for the film industry, and so I think whatever amazing films and stories came out of its existence were probably well worth the work it took to make it.",

She gained fame by working her hands and face. She was an expert in conveying emotion strictly through body language. The lack of sound in her films demanded it. The result in Sunset Boulevard is a sympathetic character that is also one of the best villains of all-time.Sunset Boulevard also shows that our obsession with fame and maintaining it aren't new. Although much can be said and written about the hyper-invasive tabloid times in which we currently live, it's really a dream that's been around for a very long time. Desmond needs the spotlight to survive. Outside of it, she struggles to survive. The need to be remembered and, in a sense, worshiped, is what drives her and her passions. But like every film, it's all an act and one that ultimately cannot be maintained while still remaining sane.Arturo Montenora",

If you like old movies, there is a lot to be said for this one. The aging starlet, who watches her own films, on a projection screen hidden behind a painting, in her living room, is something else. About ten years later, The Twilight Zone television program did a great takeoff on this concept, in an episode called, \"The Sixteen Millimeter Shrine\", starring Ida Lupino. That episode was what persuaded me to someday find \"Sunset Boulevard\", and give it a looking-at. Turns out, it's a great movie, and I can see why it was often imitated and spoofed.",

He would eventually become crazy, too. Now that would be great! Gloria Swanson's 'eager-for-attention' acting is nice, but maybe somewhat overacted. Cinematography is beautiful, though. After all, I find this movie overpriced. 8.7? Come on! Sunset Blvd. is good film-noir, but it's silly to consider it as one of the best movies ever produced.",

She is tragically cut off from the world and in his role he is drawn to her for reasons that seem to not even known to him.

She lives in a fantasy world. Erich Von Stroheim plays a very attentive butler; he was previously married to Swanson in days gone by. I really like how the movie starts with the dead body of Holden and backtracks the rest of the way. It's very eerie that Holden is narrating his own murder, as well as the rest of the movie.

SUNSET is a mesmerizing experience from beginning to end, its continuity a seamless triumph of cinematic construction.  With a cynically incisive script which never once falters, and an exquisite style and look that is visually breathtaking throughout, SUNSET BLVD is a spellbinding and unforgetable piece of filmmaking from one of the world's great 20th Century artists, Billy Wilder, who is arguably the best of the best in American cinema.  True, he's contributed his share of mediocrity, and worse; but, then, there isn't an artist dead or alive who hasn't failed aesthetically at one time or another.

            "content": "Sunset Blvd.'s appeal lies in its exquisitely creepy and alluring portrayal of '50s Hollywood. Its timelessness and ability to retain relevance more than sixty years after its release is especially ironic considering the plight of its lead, the eccentric faded silent-film star, Norma who despite her desperate and obsessive attempts to cling to her former stardom, remains obsolete. The unique ambiguity between reality and fiction achieved via the casting choices adds depth and allows for audiences to look past the illusion of the glitz and magic of the industry and witness a story of failure that was, at the time, uncharacteristic to the typical film climate of Hollywood escapist pictures. The mordant wit and lavish, Gothic set design are aspects that add to the overall tone of this gorgeously grotesque classic. Both Norma and Gillis are outsiders, teetering on the edge of obscurity, caught in the claw-like grip of hopeless need and desire to make it in the industry. Wilder's film captures the callous nature of the studio system, through the narrative of Gillis and the investigation surrounding his mysterious murder. MGM executive, Louis B. Mayer's reported disgust at this film had much to do with the belief that the movie was a disgrace to Hollywood. Sunset Blvd.'s portrayal of Norma was terribly offensive to the industry, which \"relied heavily on the power of illusion\" (Culbertson 2006). Mayer's revulsion must only have been magnified as the film went on to win three Oscars and an enduring place in Hollywood history.",

Being chased down by the insurance company for late car payments, he decides to hide his car in the worst possible house he could've found in the hills, the house of Norma Desmond.A great film about film-making, this is one of Billy Wilder's best. It makes satire of the business of Hollywood tying an intriguing plot, bittersweet, funny, and reminiscent of an era. Dealing with many intra-personal problems, you will find either great comedy withing this film or great drama.

Usually, when I watch classics from the early part of the century, I can usually appreciate the historical values and innovations in those movies, but they don't usually blow me away like Sunset Boulevard did. I was speechless for most of the movie and the ending, although I knew about it, still amazed me. There are some humorous moments like who the coffin was for in the beginning.

It shows Hollywoods weaker side and what it does to people like Norma Desmond, they make them stars, and once they get older, they throw them away as if there not needed. But it also takes slaps at writers, studios, film writers, and even directors. Wonderful script, and is masterfully filmed in black in white by Billy Wilder. The acting is absolutely amazing, everyone at their best! William Holden is wonderful in his role. You see all of his emotions very well throughout the film, when he's angry, when he feels sorry for Norma, and the helplessness on his face when he finds out Norma is madly in love with him, and he can't do anything. Max I thought was great too, but his character is quite sad, giving up his whole career of directing to take care of Norma and having to lie to her constantly, telling her she is \"The greatest star of them all\" and its almost like he's making it even worse. Now, Gloria freaking Swanson is just magnificent!!!!!!!!!! Everything, I mean everything about her acting in this film is spot on and incredible. When she loses it finally, it's almost like your losing it too. It's frightening almost. There's so much to discuss, I could go on and no. I can't think of any other film that is as monumental and amazing as this work of art. Gloria Swanson gives the best performence by an actress in movie history!

I watched the whole thing twice, after having watched it dozens of times over the years. I was struck again by just how timeless this film is, in every way. Every aspect is perfect--the dialogue, the casting, the cinematography, the costumes & set, the soundtrack, and of course the brilliant acting & directing.Others in this comment section have written wonderful plot summaries and spoken to technical features so I won't repeat. I will point out just two things that I noticed: 1) When Swanson visits DeMille at Paramount, and he tells her to sit in his chair and watch for a bit, she is almost hit in the head by, of all things, a microphone on a boom. Annoyed, she pushes it firmly out of the way and out of the screen. Just priceless! What an inspired bit of symbolic \"business\"; it so beautifully, almost subliminally, underlines her feelings about how the movies have disintegrated into \"talk, talk, talk\". 2) In the final scene, when Swanson is descending the staircase, the figures of the spectators are arranged just as carefully as those on a bas-relief frieze over a Roman temple. The composition is stunning! Even as the camera follows Swanson down the stairs, she passes people in poses just as static and stylized as statues. Another example of inspired juxtaposition of old and new--true genius at work. I wonder how many arrangements of people Wilder considered, and discarded, before he came up with this very specific one.An incredible achievement in every way, even more amazing considering the year it was made.

However, these over theatrics and acts of grandeur is something she carried into her real life... which seems fitting when you take into account this is a woman who thinks of herself as larger than life.Not only has Norma refused to accept that the now popular \"Talkies\" has taken over the movie industry but, she also still has it in her head that she was and still is the greatest actress that ever was...... In her mind,time hasn't really passed by or, passed her by because she's \"Still big. It's the movies that got small\".Swanson is marvelous as a woman who is obviously delusional and to make matters worst... mentally unstable. William Holden is perfect as the down-on-his luck Hollywood writer who had the misfortune to form a bond with the great Norma Desmond and Erich Von Stroheim is wonderful as Norma's faithful servant.
