This is a film that like a vintage wine gets better with age.Of course, the right elements were put together in this venture under Mr. Hamer's direction, which is probably the best tribute one could say about the film.Louis Mazzini, the young man who should have inherited a noble title that is lost as her mother elopes with an Italian tenor and she is disinherited. Louis is determined to regain what's due to him, by whatever means possible. Things go well for him, but he commits a mistake in entering an illicit romance with the calculating Sibella, while at the same time falling in love with the radiant Edith D'Ascoyne, the young widow.Dennis Price gives a smart account of Louis Mazzini. He is a delight to watch as he keeps scratching off dead relatives from behind the picture frame. Alec Guinness portrays eight D'Ascoynes with an unusual panache. Best of all is Lady Agatha who encounters 'turbulence' while flying in a balloon. Valerie Hobson makes an impression with her Edith and Joan Greenwood is at her best as Sibella.This is a film to treasure.",

            "content": "As much as I loved The Ladykillers, Kind Hearts and Coronets is my personal favourite of the Ealing comedies. One might argue that the narration is overused, I would say the narration added to the darkness, wit and charm of this superb film. The cinematography is crisp and smooth, and the score is great. Then we are treated to a deliciously witty script, that is funny, dark and has bite. The story slips smoothly between dastardly deaths in the guise of a self-satisfied memoir, and is gripping while moving along at a good pace, and the direction is secure. But it is the quality of the acting that elevates Kind Hearts and Coronets. Dennis Price is brilliant as the inventive killer, and Joan Greenwood is delicious as Sibella the vamp. Also convincing as Edith is Valerie Hobson, but the scene stealer in no less than eight roles is Alec Guinness in a real tour de force. While some of his roles are small, they perfectly show off his versatility. Overall, superb and deliciously dark Ealing comedy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

True, one or two are barely given time to register before Dennis Price dispatches them (Lady Agatha would have been interesting as a fully rounded character), but those which are developed - Henry, the photography enthusiast in particular, are cleverly played and memorable.  Price also does well in his role.  The ladies - Joan Greenwood and Valerie Hobson - are excellent.  The great strength of this film is in its black humour, and of course in its delicious twist ending.  I can't bear to think of it remade with a 2000's gloss.",

What can one say about a comedy centred around a dapper, charming, likable, impoverished young English gentleman who is at the same time an utterly remorseless, ever-calculating killer who has no qualms about killing an entire line of relatives who all stand in his path to inherit the family fortune? On top of that, he all the while takes great care in preserving his demeanor and status as a gentleman; all the relatives he must eliminate are brought to life by the genius of Alec Guinness; and there's an executioner who takes pains to show proper respect to his social \"superior.\" The dialogue, indeed pretty much all of the humour, is a shining example of \"British humour\" at its best. It is subtle, clever, dark, and full of irony and satire. It is pure, brilliant entertainment that doesn't stop. Comedy really can't get much better than this.",

            "content": "This fine film is an example of Ealing at its very best, with a superlative script and acting of a very high standard. In watching, one is once more all too sadly aware of the difference in quality between British films of this era and today; there can't have been in recent times a screenplay as cleverly comic, economical and incisive as this is. The level of wit is high, and perfectly suitable for a black comedy such as this. Certain lines and scenes linger agreeably in the memory; the part where Price, in his droll narration, slips into verse, is wonderful, as is the \"fight\" he has with a lower-class rival; \"I'm not going to drawn into a scuffle with you!\"The element of class satire is strong, and while one is shown the lethargy and complacency of the upper classes through the amusing parade of Alec Guinness' characters, Price's corrupt plans are never condemned as such. His character, vigorous and witty, and the clever tool of narration, which in its tone draws in the viewer almost as a confidant. Similarly, but to an even more effective degree than in \"Whisky Galore!\" (1948) and \"The League of Gentlemen\" (1959), the viewer is made sympathetic to wrong-doings. The stunningly executed plot and dialogue are finely put across indeed by all of the actors. In the main role, Price refines and defines the cad Mancini perfectly; it really is a great performance, making the character more than memorable. Alec Guinness is great in his 8 roles, making a distinctive actorly mark in all of them. It says a lot that in a career as formidable as Guinness', in TV, film and theatre, his contribution to this film particularly stands out. The two ladies are impeccably played by Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood, who contrast quite perfectly; Hobson as rich and strait-laced if certainly beautiful, and Greenwood as the distinctively seductive childhood friend. Price's \"juggling\" of his two women is wonderfully arch and amusing. The film's ending should be noted as quite ingenious and wonderfully in keeping with the film's overall wit.In the context even of Ealing, a studio adept at clever comedies, this is an extra-special film. Along with the films of this era of Powell and Pressburger and Carol Reed, this film makes one nostalgic for the days when British film was both distinctively British and universal in its qualities. Wonderfully funny and compelling, this film is one of my few favourites of all and overwhelmingly recommended.Rating:- *****/*****",

            "content": "Although most Americans have little knowledge of his work other than Star Wars, Alec Guinness produced an amazing body of work--particularly in the 1940s-1950s--ranging from dramas to quirky comedies. I particularly love his comedies, as they are so well-done and seem so natural and real on the screen--far different from the usual fare from Hollywood.Before I saw this film, I had seen The Mouse That Roared and was spellbound by Peter Sellars and how he played the roles of so many people in that little movie (ranging from the hero to the prime minister to even the queen). I did not realize until later that Alec Guinness had done an equally masterful job about a decade earlier with this movie.Although not quite my favorite Ealing film starring him, it is certainly among my favorites. It is the story of a serial killer who you find yourself rooting for to get away with the crimes! Unlike some sicko, the main character has some understandable motivation for killing off several extended family members in order to obtain the family fortune. And when he kills several of these people, you find yourself wanting him to kill them as well! Now that takes amazing writing and acting to pull that off!! So see this charming little comedy. It has come on Turner Classic Movies several times lately, but if you can find the video, rent it!",

How he goes about bumping off the family members is memorable in itself. It just goes to show you that class distinctions could possibly drive anyone up the walls.What makes this film so good is the ironic twists that we see occurring between our gentleman friend and the two ladies of his life.

            "review_title": "\"You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.\"",
            "content": "There's more than a touch of Oscar Wilde in this film. There is irony and elegant decadence, both in the visuals and in the script. The narrator, Louis Mazzini (Price), has murdered several people who stand between him and the title to which he feels entitled. Invited to go on a hunt with one of his victims-to-be he agrees to stroll along but refuses to carry a shotgun because he is opposed to blood sports. The protagonist is supercilious, snotty, and a complete egotist who is happy that one of his benefactors dies a natural death since it makes it unnecessary to kill him. It's so uncomfortable to murder someone with whom one has not had disagreements.What also strikes me is the resemblance to Vladimir Nabokov's \"Lolita\", both in its structure and execution. Of course the movie lacks all of Nabokov's poetry (\"Light of my life. Fire of my loins\") but so does everything else ever written.Yet there are some isomorphic qualities in \"Kind Hearts and Coronets,\" aside from the elegant irony and the snobbishness of the narrator. Humbert Humbert is guilty not just of killing Quilty but of ruining the youth of an adolescent girl and he comments on his own perversity with the kind of distant amusement that Price's narrator does. Price's own debaucheries amuses him. At a wedding, he congratulates the groom whose virginal bride he seduced the evening before: \"You're a lucky man. Take my word for it.\" And, like Humbert, he feels nothing but contempt for people with \"suburban ways\". He's fastidious in his wardrobe and grooming. And if Humbert's love for Lolita was real, it was rarely expressed without being undercut by irony. (\"I was a pentapod monster.\") Similarly, Price has one real engine driving him -- a genuine desire to revenge the humiliation and death of his beloved mother -- although it's only brought up seriously once or twice. Both Price, as Mazzini, and Humbert Humbert are always showing off and quoting poetry. (Price's final quote, \"How happy could I be with either, Were t' other dear charmer away!\" is from Gay's \"The Beggar's Opera.\") The movie is extremely funny. The acting is superb all around, with Guiness being the splashiest performer in his five roles. But Price could not be improved upon. The way he manhandles his drunken rival Lionel, throwing him to the floor, then brushing his hands as if they'd been dirtied. And his improvised sample of the Matabele language (\"colloquial rendering of course\").The director has all of this down just pat. It's a very British movie. The understatement is almost overstated. Only two of the murdered people die on screen -- one peacefully. I cannot see an American remake of this without a lot of on screen blood and violence which, in my humble opinion, would drain the story of much of its humor.I will give just one example of what I mean, out of many possible. One of the men standing between Price and his title of Duke of Chalfont is played by Guiness as an amateur photography enthusiast who keeps a stash of sherry and whiskey in his windowless woodshed, in which he develops his prints. Guiness also hides some whiskey there, his wife being a \"prig\". Price substitutes an explosive for the kerosene in the lamp of the darkroom. Later, Price, Guiness, and Guiness's wife (Hobson) are having tea and Guiness decides to rush off to the woodshed to \"develop\" some film, leaving Price and Hobson carrying on a civilized conversation. About one hundred yards behind the couple is a stone wall behind which is the shed. Some time passes while Price and Hobson trade decorous Victorian observations on photography and so forth. During this exchange we hear a slight \"thud\". A few moments later a wisp of white smoke appears from behind the stone wall, roughly in the vicinity of the woodshed. The smoke increases and becomes a billow, at which point Price comments that \"someone must be burning leaves in the garden.\" Try as I might, I can't imagine a modern remake of this particular scene without a long suspenseful and explicit demonstration of Guiness going into the shed, striking a match, lighting the lamp, and having it explode in his face. There would follow an exterior shot of the shed being blown apart by a fireball, the stones flying through the air, the shrieks of Hobson and Price at their tea. It would simply be a different movie and not nearly as good.Man, this is funny. See it quick before they remake it and ruin it, as they did recently with Ealing's \"The Ladykillers.\"",

            "content": "Though it had been producing films since the 1930s, it wasn't until 1949 that Ealing Studios finally commenced its golden period. In was in this year that they released the first batch of their most entertaining comedies, including Alexander Mackendrick's 'Whisky Galore! (1949),' Henry Cornelius' 'Passport to Pimlico (1940),' Charles Frend's 'A Run for Your Money (1949)' {a little-known gem of which I'm very fond} and, of course, Robert Hamer's 'Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949),' which launched Alec Guinness into a successful career with the studio. Easily one of the darkest comedies of its era, Hamer's film was loosely adapted from the novel \"Israel Rank,\" by Roy Horniman \u0096 among other changes, the main character was renamed from Israel Rank to Louis Mazzini, to avoid any perceived anti-Semitism so soon after World War Two. The title itself was derived from an 1842 poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson, which reads, in part: \"Kind hearts are more than coronets, and simple faith than Norman blood.\" The films of Ealing Studios can often be characterised as good-natured, down-to-earth comedy offerings, light-hearted in tone and always steering towards the attainment of community betterment; characters typically conclude the film having learned a valuable lesson, and the ending is usually most ideal for all concerned. Later films such as 'The Lavender Hill Mob (1951)' and especially 'The Ladykillers (1955)' returned to the murky themes of Hamer's film, but they couldn't avoid reinforcing the age-old adage that \"crime doesn't pay,\" whereas this comedy leaves ample room for the possibility of our killer escaping scot-free {however, for audiences across the Atlantic, the Production Code dictated that this ambiguity be removed}. Likely influenced by Charles Chaplin's 'Monsieur Verdoux (1947)' \u0096 a \"comedy of murders\" \u0096 Hamer unwaveringly filled his film to the brim with dark themes, dry wit and bitter irony, finding a hilariously suave and classy serial killer in actor Dennis Price, whose unflinching murderous plight attains a twisted sense of empathy through the maltreatment of his mother's memory at the hands of the D'Ascoyne family.I've often remarked that Alec Guinness never plays the same role twice, his character changing unrecognisably from picture to picture. In the case of this film, he virtually changes from scene to scene, portraying all eight heirs to the Dukedom of Chalfont with uproarious charisma and versatility. It helps that most of Guinness' creations, merely targets for the conniving Louis Mazzini, are wholly unlikable or frustratingly senile, though there's certainly a pang of regret when the amiable photography hobbyist is murdered, and the manner in which The Duke is dispatched is shocking in its sheer cold-bloodedness. Perhaps a single complaint is that the murders of Lady Agatha and the General were skipped over much too quickly, and I would have enjoyed a more in-depth examination of the mechanics of the crime. The final act of the film is swathed in a healthy dose of irony, as Mazzini is arrested and charged for the one murder he didn't commit, his fate sealed and then rescued by his jilted mistress, Sibella (Joan Greenwood), who alone guesses the truth about what he has done.",

Imagine his fury and dismay when they say no. He sets about getting revenge, as well as winning the heart of the mercenary woman he loves through murdering each of the eight d'Ascoyne family members that stand between him and a title, riches, and everything that he feels he deserves.Wearing the Ealing black comedy streak on its sleeve and gleefully black, Kind Hearts and Coronets has got to be one of the funniest films about murder to be made. Much of this owes kudos to Alec Guinness' fantastic performance, a true tour-de-force in comedy. He plays all eight of the family members, from the suffragette feminist Lady Agatha d'Ascoyne, to the dull and dim Reverend d'Ascoyne with commendable diversity, changing his tone, stature, facial expressions and accent to play each character as if they were a completely new person. Such a performance could only prepare us for good things, which Guinness then continued to deliver.That said, Dennis Price takes the lead excellently. As Louis Mazzini d'Ascoyne, he murders, poisons and drowns each of the characters without a sense of remorse that could seem cold and inhumane, but the audience find amusing. We eagerly await his calculation of the death of another, because we know it will have hilarious consequences, and the plot never holds back. However, his dry narration tells a story that hides a sad tinge, as well as delivering sardonic social commentary on post-war Britain, where the gold digging (played with disgusting sugariness by Joan Greenwood) women were everywhere and to some people, rank was all that mattered. This is what makes each of the deaths so comical, giving us a little glee that the snobs are getting what they deserve.For those who don't want to watch a film for the history lesson, no fear \u0096 Kind Hearts and Coronets truly shines as a comedy. Even now, the one-liners and biting irony rings and every scene has a joke to laugh at. Under director Robert Hamer's ultra-capable hands, a warm-hearted satire has been crafted. You really can't get much better, or much intelligent than this.",

            "content": "Robert Hamer's 1949 film \"Kind Hearts & Coronets\" is the epitome of British humor, from start to finish. Louis Mazzini (Price) is a descendant of the D'Ascoyne family, a family of royals, but unfortunately his mother has been disowned by the family for taking up with and marrying Louis Mazzini Sr., an Italian singer whom the family highly disapproves of. When Mazzini Sr. meets an untimely death early in young Louis' life, he sees his mother struggle to give him everything he needs, so after she dies, he vows revenge. He decides that he will get his birthright and become the Duke of Chalfont, except he has to get through the eight people ahead of him (all members of the D'Ascoyne family are played by Alec Guinness) who are in line for the title. Meanwhile, while he is calculating how he is going to commit cold-blooded murder to knock off each heir, he carries on a sort of double affair with Sibella (Greenwood), a woman who he has been enamored with since they were children and is now married to a former classmate of theirs, and Edith (Hobson), the young widow of one of the D'Ascoyne heirs that Louis offs. The story is told in flashbacks as Louis sits in a jail cell, awaiting his execution and writing his memoirs.This was one of the most clever and wickedly funny films I had seen in a long time. I honestly had no idea what to expect from it when I started watching; I only knew that it was an IMDb Top 250 film and it starred Alec Guinness. I didn't have a clue that it was going to turn out to be one of the greatest examples of British comedy I've seen this side of Monty Python. The gags in the film are so dry and subtle (at one point, Louis causes an explosion that means the demise of one of the D'Ascoyne heirs, yet when it goes off while he and the heir's wife are sitting in the garden having tea, neither of them even flinch, and she doesn't notice something is wrong until she actually turns around and sees the plumes of black smoke) and the theme so dark that it could theoretically be easy to forget that one is actually watching a comedy. There are no sight gags, double takes or high hilarity present, which makes this film all the more appealing, because it elicited huge laughs without stooping to typical elements of comedy.I thought that Guinness was going to be the breakout guy in \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\", and believe me, it's certainly noteworthy to see him dressed in drag as Lady Agatha, but the real star of the film was the fantastic Dennis Price. He plays Louis with the slick charm of a Rex Harrison, but it is clear that his heart and temperament is far more nefarious than anything Harrison could drum up, even when he was plotting to kill his wife in \"Unfaithfully Yours\". When he utters lines like \"The next morning I went out shooting with Ethelred - or rather, to watch Ethelred shooting; for my principles will not allow me to take a direct part in blood sports\" when he has not only already killed several, but is planning on killing Ethelred himself, his aplomb yet sincere delivery is comic gold.I really enjoyed \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" and sincerely hope that even though it seems to be slipping more and more to the bottom of the IMDb Top 250 list after an initial strong appearance, its placement on the list will make more people seek it out. Frankly, I had never heard of the film before seeing it appear on the list, and I consider myself to be fairly adequate in my knowledge of classic film. And you'd be hard pressed to find a better classic film comedy than this one; it is ahead of its time in its clever wickedness. I would be willing to bet the Coen Brothers are fans of this film. 8/10 --Shelly",

The talented Sir Alec plays eight, count 'em eight different members of the D'Ascoyne family. These folks stand between Dennis Price and his quest for the title of Duke of Chalfont.Seems as though Price's mother was read out of the family when she married an Italian music teacher. She never forgot who she was and brought her son up to never forget as well.Price's supercilious narration which sets the tone for the film as he describes his various acts of murder tell as much about him as it does about the various people of the D'Ascoyne family. He's probably a bigger snob than all of the people he's killing.When you think about it, what is Price doing that Richard III didn't do to gain a throne in Shakespeare's adaption of his story? Interesting how we can be amused at Price bumping off his relations and be horrified at Laurence Olivier doing the same in his Richard III film. Then, that's black comedy.Alec Guinness was given great acclaim for essaying those many roles. My favorite has always been that doddering old fool of a clergyman whom we are told is in the proper profession.Kind Hearts and Coronets is set during Edwardian Britain when class and stature meant far more than they do now. It's a great tribute to the skill of the players and the writers that audiences today, even American audiences can enjoy it set in a world that is unimaginable to us.

STRANGELOVE is a truly black comedy, ending in the destruction of the planet, KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS is a moral tale in spite of its theme of cold-blooded revenge.The \"for instances\" of irony go on forever in this film. Here are a few: Sibella rejects Louis for being too poor and marries the rich Lionel. Ultimately both she and Lionel turn in despair to the prosperous Louis for support.As Young D'Ascoyne indifferently deprives Louis of his position at the shop, so Louis coolly goes on to replace Young D'Ascoyne at the bank.The two members of the D'Ascoyne family who suffer the most emotional distress by Louis's murders (Edith and The Banker) are the two who do the most to give him aid and comfort.The Reverend Henry, in spite of being a Christian minister, lives in an atmosphere of luxury and pleasure to excess. His very reputation provides an excuse for his poisoning and its resultant cover-up.The Admiral's sheer inaccessibility protects him from Louis but dooms him all the same. Even a man standing beside him can't get through his thick skull in time to save him. He drowns at the salute with a life preserver bobbing nearby.The General praises the fame of the Russians for their caviar, forgetting that they were also infamous for their bombs.Lady Agatha is a crusader for women's rights, but it's her own equality with men as an heir to the Dukedom of Chalfond that marks her for elimination. Her willingness to martyr herself in one cause (women's suffrage and freeborn equality) gives Louis the opportunity to kill her for its exact opposite (patriarchy and inherited rights.) The cruel and judgmental Duke is caught and sentenced to death in a mantrap set by his own orders, and executed with his own weapon.Edith marries Louis as a show of faith in his innocence even though he turned her into a widow once before and will do so again if he's hanged.The eager executioner loses his opportunity to hang a nobleman because his inflated sense of occasion delays the proceedings.Lastly, Louis escapes the noose only to hang himself seven times over when years of meticulous planning are undone by a moment of forgetfulness.The more you watch this movie, the more details emerge each time.

I know that Hollywood seems to have forgotten that there's nothing to be gained by trying to remake a perfect film. If they ever dare to do it with this one--I don't give a damn who is in it, or who directs or writes--don't bother. See the original. None genuine without the Ealing Label.",

            "content": "The best and most loved of the Ealing Comedies is also the darkest. Kind Hearts and Coronets is probably most famous today as \"that film in which Alec Guinness plays eight characters.\" That said, it is Denis Price as Louis Mazzini, the charming, urbane serial killer, who really steals the show.The film opens in prison, with the Louis Mazzini D'Ascoyne, Ninth Duke of Chalfont awaiting execution for one of the few suspicious deaths in the film he wasn't responsible for. On that, his last night, he is completing his memoirs, which act as a framing device for the rest of the film, as well as allowing for a dry, witty narration from Mazzini himself.Kind Hearts and Coronets is everything modern cinema is not. It is not laugh-out-loud comedy, but a biting wit that often leaves you wondering whether you should be laughing at all. The screenwriter takes seeming delight in the precision of the dialogue, with no unnecessary verbiage. This culminates in an astonishing minimalist performance from Price when he finds himself in the dock of the House of Lords, being tried by his peers.I suppose you could look at Kind Hearts and Coronets as a form of social commentary. It was made after WWII, after the Beverage reforms, and may reflect a growing restlessness with the stuffiness of the old social order. Certainly, Louis is presented with such sympathy, and his nefarious endeavours told with such gleeful abandon that it is difficult for the audience not to identify with him.You could regard it as a form of social commentary but, frankly, why bother? It's just glorious fun and, despite a certain English post-war feel, surprisingly modern and anarchic \u0096 there can be few films, even today, which cast a multiple murderer so firmly in the hero role. And there can be few modern films were the dialogue is so witty, for instance, when excusing his flustered state of mind after his first murder by saying \"furthermore, I am not naturally callous\".Of course, everyone talks about Alec Guinness' acting tour de force \u0096 playing all eight other members of the D'Ascoyne family; from young Ascoyne D'Ascoyne to the hilariously named Elthelred D'Ascoyne (presumable unready for the fate that awaits him), the Eighth Duke of Chalfont. In reality, few of these characters receive more than a footnote in the film. But this is more than made up for by the splendid cast of other leading British actors \u0096 Denis Price, Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood being the notables.This remains not only my favourite Ealing Comedy, but right up there with Dr Strangelove as one of my favourite comedy films ever made. A wonderful, heart-warming tale of multiple murder. 9\u00bd / 10",

            "content": "It's a rare film, even among the good ones, that moves faster the second time you see it. Yet this is but one of the many virtues of this brilliant Ealing comedy, a brutally dark satire of the English upper class that sails along on gossamer wings.The film is best known for Alec Guinness's performance in eight separate roles, all of them members of the D'Ascoyne family, a rare duchy in which succession was possible from the female as well as male sides. Thus, when one D'Ascoyne woman is disowned from the family for marrying an Italian singer named Mazzini, she still retains the power of succession, as does her son Louis, provided the other D'Ascoynes die without issue. A grown Louis, smarting at his mother's treatment and his own lowly position in life, sets out to improve his station by exterminating his kin.Watching this film, it becomes clear pretty early that the central performance is not Guinness's but Dennis Price as Louis. Price not only has to carry the story with his acting and droll narration, but give us a figure we can both sympathize with and be horrified by. An earlier reviewer likened him to Richard III, but even those of us who enjoy Gloucester's skullduggery are glad to see him undone in the end. Louis Mazzini is unique in that we don't want him to fail, even when his victims (like the gentle parson and the henpecked photography buff Henry) are not so deserving of his homicidal attentions. It's a marvelously perverse treatment, done up in a very lighthearted way, and Price in his urbane Basil Rathbone underdog fashion carries the ball for all of us.By the end of the film, there's more upended Guinnesses to be found here than in a Dublin tavern, yet \"Kind Hearts And Coronets\" is not merely a British version of the much inferior \"Arsenic And Old Lace.\" As Louis rises while his kinspeople fall, he finds himself having to choose between two lovely ladies, one a D'Ascoyne widow (Valerie Hobson) of high principles to which Louis aspires, the other a childhood chum (Joan Greenwood) who shares the darker impulses which got him where he is. There's a good deal of real dramatic and romantic tension in how Louis juggles his affections, along with some more killer comedy.Greenwood is especially remarkable, with lush bedroom eyes, a voice like a dipso courtesan, and a talent for drawing big laughs from her character's selfish pronouncements. She's so monstrous at times, teasing out Louis's early expressions of desire and taunting him about his aspirations for dukedom (\"Maybe pigs will fly\"), yet as the tale unfolds and she finds herself on the outside of Louis's bright future, we find ourselves pulled as much by her desperate, dark measures as we have been by Louis's. The two, as they agree, are made for each other.Like I said, this movie moves faster the second time you see it, because once you know what's cooking, the sly script and ace delivery makes a more positive impression, and make you a more receptive viewer. In that way, I wish the film had given us another 15 minutes, rounded itself out to two full hours, and given us more of the other Guinness D'Ascoynes, like the General (Guinness's best character with his gravelly voice and tales of bloody debacles) and Lady Agatha. What we get is sometimes a tad too neatly handled, and detracts slightly from the overall greatness.There's a casual brutality to this film that's a wonder for its time, and renders \"Kind Hearts And Coronets\" timeless. Yet we also have in Louis Mazzini a character to pull for, and an ending that does not disappoint either in cleverness or fun. Give \"Kind Hearts And Coronets\" a chance, and you may well walk away realizing the Pythons didn't only not invent merry black comedies, they didn't even perfect them.",

            "content": "As I've said on all my Ealing movie reviews, I watched these cause the plots looked interesting but I'm still unsure on how to judge the movies. I'm not one to dismiss them as 'old' and therefore 'boring'; at the same time I don't just jump on the bandwagon saying they're classics just because they've got that reputation and a lot of people without even judging for themselves assume they're great.To quote to further my point - \"A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read. A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read.\" -Mark Twain So, watching this with an open mind, I really enjoyed it. Yes you have to realise it's not a modern movie so the kind of themes and scenes presented are different from the packaged elements of modern Hollywood, but that makes postwar British cinema very refreshing viewing. I think the use of the term 'comedy' is misleading because it most likely refers to it in the classic literary sense from Shakespeare and Greek theatre (probably in the early 20th century people were a bit better read than today so these terms would still have meaning to them) which refers to a story with happy ending and farcial plot and wit rather than obvious jokes like in the modern sense but even these movies have some funny scenes. Also the humour and premise is black comedy and subtle so look for something modern if you need laugh-out-loud movies.'Kind Hearts and Coronets' When I first came across this the plot looked so unique I knew I just had to see it at least once, although I've rewatched it many times since. I do find Guinness's 8 roles are over-hyped because most of them have few lines and the distinctions between a few of them are non-existent though it's still a novelty and a brave act to pull off in a movie. For me, Mazzini's 'bad guy' characterisation is the most appealing element of the movie, with a characterisation that makes even a criminal charming and someone to empathise with a little (and for me some visual appeal). The unique premises of who we see him murder next and the wit and black humour makes it a treasure of a film that I'm glad was made and is still available and enjoyed. One of my most beloved films for definite. Definitely worth one watch just to see something different.",

            "content": "Kind Hearts and Corrents is in a sense an extrapolation of Jane Austin's satire of the English aristocracy. Where Austin gives the reader a sarcastic insight into their ways of life, Kind Hearts and Correnets kills the English aristocracy off, as if to symbolise their slow demise within modernity. But, as this film illustrates the aristocracy has methods of survival via its never ending line of descendants ready to take on hereditary titles. Ironically, the survival of the dukedom in this film is due to the actual banished heir to that title murdering his relatives who stand in his way. If you like, this is an illustration of how there will always be an aristocracy of sorts, in the form of rulers in all types of societies, as illustrated in George Orwell's Animal Farm. This is because as the famous psychologist Erich Fromm says, as a conservative society we have a 'fear of freedom' and depend on being subordinates of rulers, like children to their parents. In Kind Hearts and Correnets we see an example of this when the duke performs his paternalistic duty for his dependant proletariat.The irony is that the lead actor, Dennis Price, in Kind Hearts and Corerenets is a descendant of minor aristocracy, himself deprived of his title due to the paternalistic line being directed away from him. In this case he plays the part of the denounced heir superbly. Meanwhile Valery Hobson shines out as a beautiful, elegant lady, which could be less to do with acting skills and more about playing herself.As for Sir Alec Guiness, it goes without saying that he steals the film, with his range of acting talents, here some of them showcased in all the characters he plays.In the case of the screenplay, it is wittily directed, well paced, entertaining, and never for a second boring. This permits a distraction for the viewer, and the overlooking of the minor flaw of how there were no accusations pointed towards the lead character which are to the viewer easily detectable given that he was present at most of the murders of his arosticratic relatives.Overall, an ageless classic.",

            "content": "Many people now days seem to have forgotten how Alec Guinness started out his career once. He was a quite successful comedy actor and appeared in several genre movies, often as the leading man. This sort of all changed after he won an Oscar for his serious role in \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\". Ever since people tend to mostly remember him for his serious roles, which makes his comical appearances and talents perhaps unfortunately a bit under-appreciated.In this movie he plays no less than 8 different roles, which are all members of the same family. Sounds Eddy Murphy like but it's of course done with lots of class and talent. He seamlessly plays all of the different character with great professionally involved but never without a comical touch, without ever making the movie feel ridicules.This was also actually one of his first movie roles and it seems amazing that he already scored so many big parts early on in his career. It shows what talent he had and how many great directors were already confident enough with his skills to offer him a great part in their productions.But it's of course not just Alec Guinness which makes this movie a great, amusing watch. I must say that all of the acting is simply great within the movie. It features some classy British acting, from mostly some unknown actors involved. Especially also Dennis Price knows to impress as the leading man of the movie.But it above all is also a greatly written movie. It features a nice concept, that serves perfectly as one to bring some good entertainment to the screen. It's a very amusing movie, mostly through its story. But it's also well constructed all. It's also a story that provides the movie with lots of pace, which also helps to make this movie better to watch now days than some of the other genre movies from the same era.The movie is being a comedy but it's a quite dark and subtle one. The humor and comedy doesn't ever get exaggerated and it relies often more on its clever writing than any of the movie its visuals or actors physics.A fine amusing movie to watch, that got made very well and with some great actors involved.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

From Dennis Price we see the cool, calculated killer, totally focused and utterly charming in every way, and for whom every act of homicide must never, ever, offend the sensitive nature of the English Gentleman. From the supporting cast, we see great performances from Miles Malleson as the hangman, whose determination to address the Duke correctly leads him to practice his bowing, scraping, and 'Your Grace'-ing. Also, there is a great performance from Valerie Hobson as the widowed Edith D'Ascoyne. My favourite role (other than the lead) was Joan Greenwood as Sibella Holland - played in such a sultry, seductive way that I immediately thought of Fenella Fielding in Carry On Screaming!

            "content": "Sitting in his cell with an 8am death sentence awaiting him, Louis Mazzini decides to write his story to last after he is gone. His story starts with his mother marrying outside of her class by going with an Italian singer (who dies on Louis' birth). With her money all gone, Mrs Mazzini decides to appeal to her relatives in the D'Ascoyne family \u0096 who reject her without reply. With her birthright denied she schools her son in her family tree in the hope that he will someday gain his inheritance. When she dies suddenly, her only wish is to be buried in the family plot \u0096 a wish that is denied, enraging Louis. Selecting the living members of the D'Ascoyne family, Louis decides to kill them one by one in revenge.It is a shame that this film has slowly started to be lost to modern audiences and is not as highly regarded by younger viewers as it is by older ones (look at the voting history for IMDb \u0096 not proof but an indication). The reason for this in my mind is that this is not a rip-roaringly hilarious comedy that will have you rolling in the aisles but one that is dark, clever and wonderfully droll. The script is dripping in humour but it is the drip of bile and blood \u0096 a very cruel humour that is as deadly as an assassin. The plot is pretty simple and it's main thrust works very well. The only bum note is Louis' relationship with Sibella, which serves to slow the film down a little bit and take away from the slick pace that it manages to have for most of it's scenes. For audiences who expect a comedy to have them laughing every 30 seconds, this film will be an enigma \u0096 where are the laughs they will shout, where is the comedy? It is likely that those that would say this would be unlikely to come to such an 'old' film but it is sad that they will likely not have the patience to see the beauty in the film. To me the humour of the film seeps from every pore \u0096 it is in the droll dialogue and in the absurdities of the characters.Of course this film would not have been so good were it not for two fantastic performances from two actors who totally 'got' the film's sense of humour and deliver their characters absolutely spot on to make the humour work. Although he is naturally overlooked in favour of his co-star, Price is great (and also plays more than one character). He has to carry the less showy side of the film (ie his plot with Sibella) but his delivery is great both in performance and in his droll narration. He could have played it up for laughs but, as I say, he understood the humour and delivered accordingly. Guinness is simply brilliant. Some of his roles are very small (the Admiral for example) and others are rather ordinary but others are wonderfully absurd and he delivers them perfectly. His Parson is my favourite character as he is the most obviously absurd and enjoyable. His delivery of them all is great \u0096 very different characters even if most of them do look unmistakably like Guinness himself.Overall this is a marvelously classy film that will still be a great film no matter how much the tastes of a modern audience plummet below the patience that the film requires to enjoy it. The script is darkly humorous \u0096 dripping in dark humour throughout (albeit with few actual laugh-out-loud moments). The two leads are wonderful and their performances show a real understanding of the film's aims. It is sad that this is not shown more on television \u0096 a fact that may be due to the use of the n-word several times in the final 10 minutes rather than anything else.",

One of the last in the series, The Ladykillers, was foolishly remade by the Coen Brothers (starring Tom Hanks) and it stank. The original films had a dark humor, moral ambiguity, ingenious plots and great dialog. The best in the series was Kind Hearts and Coronets - made almost at the start of the cycle.The stars are Dennis Price as Mazzini Jr. whose deceased mother was a member of the D'Ascoyne film before being disowned for marrying an Italian opera singer. Alec Guiness plays the eight surviving D'Ascoyne's (including Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne) whose deaths could lead Mazzini to becoming Duke of Chalfont castle. Kind Hearts is a wonderfully black comedy about how Mazzini disposes of his relatives one by one in order to avenge his mother and become rich in the process. The greatest thing to note is the witty upper-class dialog. Dennis Price has the right mixture of believability and sleaziness while Guiness gives a tour-de-force of colorful performances.Kind Hearts is a very good introduction to Ealing comedies. Other good entries would be The Lavender Hill Mob (more cockney humor), The Ladykillers (which was actually funny unlike the remake) and The Man in the White Suit. All three star Alec Guiness.

            "content": "KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS is one of those classics that never ages, even after repeated viewings. The rags-to-riches tale of Louis D'Ascoyne (Dennis Price), who ascends from lowly shop-worker to the dukedom through a series of brutal murders, is told in low-key fashion, as Louis spends his last night on earth prior to his execution. Price's soft-voiced, understated method of delivery makes the film sound as if murder is a normal occurrence; the kind of thing anyone might do if they wanted to acquire power. But this is director Robert Hamer's point; in an unequal world dedicated to privilege and high birth, even the most mild-mannered personality might be tempted to step the wrong side of the tracks.With consciously shadowy photography (by Douglas Slocombe) and ingenious set-designs (William Kelner), Hamer's film created a claustrophobic world, in which the lower middle classes (represented by Louis) are doomed to live in over-stuffed living-rooms and work in fusty shops, while the upper classes live in high ceilinged, paneled castles full of dusty furniture. No one, it seems, enjoys any real comfort. Hence the only way to survive is to adopt the \"every person for themselves\" philosophy, which is precisely what Louis decides to do. The film is very much of its time, released and shot in the post-war era, when aristocratic privilege seemed an anachronism, redolent of a bygone age.Price's performance contrasts starkly with that of Joan Greenwood's Sibella - whose honeyed tones suggest willing connivance in his schemes yet turn out to be nothing more than a facade. Like Louis, she is out for what she can get and will employ every stratagem at her disposal to achieve it.At the film's center stands Alec Guinness, in a virtuoso performance of eight different roles. Some of them are no more than cameos, but his portrayal of Young Henry as an open-hearted, basically kind person stands out in a corrupt world. Sadly Henry lacks the guile and the nous to survive, and he is soon dispatched to a better place, much to Louis' mock-regret.The film ends with a classic cameo by Arthur Lowe (later to become a household name in the television series DAD'S ARMY) as a reporter who unwittingly seals Louis' fate, proving beyond doubt that it's best to remain silent about one's past if one wants to survive.",

This tension is continually highlighted by the plot. An example of this is the scene where Louis Mazzini is sitting drinking tea with Edith D'Ascoyne in the garden, and calmly continues their conversation as smoke begins to appear behind her in the distance, from the hut where her husband is being incinerated.The other chief delight for me is the language. Every word of the dialogue and narration is precise, conveying neither more nor less that it ought. The examples given on the \"Memorable Quotes\" section are by no means all that could have been chosen. Lines like those can of course only be delivered by actors who are completely familiar with the English language at its most refined, and who have the composure to speak them as they were meant to be spoken.

Whilst it's no denying that Alec Guinness is wonderful in so any performances, it's the non-stop narration and coverage by Price which really keeps the film moving along.Aided as well by some great performances by Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood, the story simply clicks into place.Really, there's little else which can be said about \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\". It's a wonderful plot with some superb acting and some great jokes. Lead at the front by eight brilliant performances by Guinness, the story progresses at pace and never fails to entertain. The finest pre-1950's film your ever likely to see.",

This is a fantastic comedy with some witty dialogue (particularly from the main character), and one actor playing all members of one family (probably one of the first actors to play more than one character in a film). Basically Louis (Dennis Price) is in prison (you know why later) writing memoirs of his recent exploits. His mother died, but she was rejected as part of the D'Ascoyne family for running off with an opera singer, so Louis gets no fortune and cannot be Duke. So he decides to start a revenge for himself and his mother by killing all the D'Ascoynes'. He would get to know them all first, and then eventually find ways to kill them and make it look accidental. All members are played by the great Sir Alec Guinness, they are The Banker, The Parson, The General, The Admiral, Young Ascoyne, Young Henry, Lady Agatha, and of course The Duke. Along the way, there is also a romance with ex-D'Ascoyne wife Edith (Valerie Hobson), as well as his real interest Sibella (Joan Greenwood). He almost gets what he should, but is found innocent for a crime he didn't commit (killing a friend), and the ending is classic. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best British Film. Sir Alec Guinness was number 12 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 2 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 11 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 47 on The 100 Greatest Films.

There is, however, an essential darkness at the heart of the movie: the cold blooded and calculating murder of all those who stand between Dennis Price and his possible succession to a title. That this is treated in so light and civilised a way is the triumph of the film. The screenplay and performances complement each other perfectly and are a credit to all those involved. I cannot think of a weak link in the film. The casting was beautifully judged down to the most minor character. The leads are, though, just about perfect. For my money, it is the best of Dennis Price's film work (though his Jeeves on television in the 60's was good, too). Guinness was splendid and well supported by Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood.

            "content": "Years and years before Tarantino was a gleam in his father's eye, a sumptuous and delightfully dark British comedy demonstrated that revenge, indeed, was a dish best served cold. And speaking of dish, I savored like a gourmet every bit of \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\". Movies like this are the kind of experiences that can be equaled to a diner in a fancy restaurant where every sip of wine, every bite of meal, from the appetizers to the dessert, plays like a carnival of sensations in your taste buds. I can't exactly pinpoint in which department Robert Hamer's movie most succeeded, but it is a combination of many factors that movies seldom achieve. It starts with the story, the title derives from an excerpt from Alfred Tennyson's poem: \"Kind hearts are more than coronets, and simple faith than Norman blood.\" The story features the spectacular ascension of Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, a young man of common birth but not so common lineage. His mother is a Noble but due to her marriage with an opera singer and her self-inflicted exile from the Family, she made herself a Persona-Non-Grata. Louis grew fatherless and all her mother's efforts to reconnect with her family or get a job for Louis met with rejection. She doesn't even get the privilege to be interred in the family vault. Meanwhile Louis proposes Sibella, a childhood friend, for marriage but only gets cruel mockeries about his rank and then-job as a draper's assistant.For newly orphaned and love-stricken Louis, these are two rejections too many and the starting point of one of the most elaborate and perfectly oiled schemes ever concocted in a film, all in pure British refinery. Holding the D'Ascoyne family as primarily responsible for all the troubles that affected his life, he decides to take his revenge and kill each member of the family to get his way to the Dukedom: eight D'Ascoyne and so many different ways to kill that you'd come to regret the Edwardian era and the bursts of stylish creativity it could inspire even in the deadliest actions. Poisoning, explosions, arrows and even plain bullets are so many weapons used by a cold and meticulous mastermind. There is something in Louis that evokes the patient efficiency of the Jackal.And more than the story, there's the storytelling. When the film opens, we actually see Louis in the night preceding his execution. He's referred to as the Duke and the executioner seems rather impressed and nervous. At first, we take it for granted that Louis was a Duke from the start, even his manners and the way he addresses a snoring cop shows that this is man cautious about his social status. But then the flashback, as narrated by his memoirs, reveals his past, and we understand that what we saw first is only the proof of his success. And this is how the narration works, it either precedes our comprehension or completes it, sometimes, what we hear and what we see effectively overlap, sometimes, narration adds to the visual enjoyment, sometimes, visuals have a literate level of appreciation. And some other times, it is just funny as hell.There's a moment in the film where Louis has just prepared an explosion to one of his targets and while he's talking about his victim's future to his soon-to-be-widowed wife, in the midst of the discussion, there's a sort of 'poof' sound. He probably heard it but he continues talking and so does the wife while you can seem a thick cloud of smoke in the background. This is pure gold of hilarity, something of comic books and cartoon levels, and yet it fits in this refined social study on the Edwardian mentalities. And of course, the comedic masterstroke remains the little gimmick the film is celebrated for: the casting of Alec Guinness in the roles of each D'Ascoyne member. Not only that, but the director even found a way to compile six different characters in the same frame, and it's refreshing to have a director try such stunts in the 40's. And I thought that Sellers was a genius and Guinness was unrecognizable in \"Ladykillers\", this is nothing compared to what Guinness achieved, especially since he's convincing in every role.Naturally, it would be unfair to associate the film's success with Guinness' talent only, there's no actor who proved unworthy, and certainly not Dennis Price, a face I found myself surprised not to know. It is sad that the actor's fate didn't match the prestige of such a debut, but he couldn't have a better lifetime role. This is one of the greatest British antiheroes that the story tactfully manages to prove sympathetic through some pivotal scenes, ethical moves and ironic twist of fates. Yet, as perfectionist as he is, the man has a weakness\u0085 \"cherchez la femme!\" Joanne Greenwood as the luscious mousy Sibella and Valerie Hobson as the dignified Edith are two pawns in the same game and provides clever complications, proving that the film didn't just take its \"serial killing\" plot for granted. The women also contribute to the ambiguity of the ending, one I dare not to spoil, except to say that it was the perfect note to conclude such a masterpiece.And masterpiece is the word for I've rarely encountered films where the story, the writing, the acting, the storytelling, the directing created such a delightful combination. The film is in the Top 10 Greatest British Movies of All-Time and for reasons, and after discovering \"Ladykillers\", another gem of Ealing Studios, I'm looking forward to discovering all these titles I've heard about such as \"The Man in the White Suit\" and \"The Lavender Hill Mob\". There's something so irresistible about these films, but I doubt they will ever equal the experience of \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\". I hope I'm wrong.",

Alec Guinness gives a wonderful performance, playing all 8 members of the d'Ascoigne family, murdered by Dennis Price as the black sheep claimant to the ducal title.  The writing is incredibly witty throughout, making full use of classic English understatement.  One of my favourites is of Guinness as a boring army general, perpetually replaying his battles at his club.  As he is brought a jar of caviar he stops his recitation to remark, \"Used to get a lot of this stuff in the Crimea.  One thing the Russkies do really well.\" Whereupon he sticks a knife in the jar and a bomb hidden inside blows him to smithereens.  The writers assume the viewer will realize that historically, bombs were the other thing the Russkies used to do really well, but I begin to wonder if young viewers today, with less knowledge of history, would get the full flavour of the joke.Dennis Price has a difficult task facing off against Guinness in so many scenes, but he does a fine job.  His voice, reciting the history of his terrible crimes against his own family, is smooth and untroubled throughout, blandly describing the unfortunate death of each d'Ascoigne, and even a few bystanders.  When his first murder takes place, he also kills off a young lady with whom the snobby Ascoigne d'Ascoigne is having a dirty weekend: \"I was sorry about the girl, but I consoled myself with the thought that she had presumably already undergone 'a fate worse than death.'\"  Such an elegant way of using the old expression that meant \"to lose one's virginity outside marriage\", and such a wickedly funny way of excusing the inexcusable.",

It also features an entertaining, if morbid, story-line and some quietly witty dialogue and other touches. It is also creative in taking the quaint yet widespread pre-occupation with titles and the peerage, and turning it on its head.All of the humor is of the driest, most \"British\" and often ironical kind, and indeed some of it is so underplayed that you don't catch it all in one viewing. Likewise, in the lead role Dennis Price is consistently restrained and even distant, and it's easy to wonder whether a somewhat less cool performance might have made the movie even better. On the other hand, too broad of a performance clearly would not have worked at all.Guinness, while always careful not to stretch a character or a scene too far, provides his characters with identifiable and usually interesting personalities. The variety helps out the movie by adding a dimension that's not always there in the major characters.The feature is generally satisfying, and always interesting, because of its refined and often ironically elegant style. At the same time, for much of the time it remains curiously unaffecting, since there is often little reason to care about the characters, other than for their entertainment value.

            "content": "Having not seen this film in many years, I re-visited it after seeing the musical version based upon the original book, \"A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder\". Like this film version, the victims are all played by one man (film: Alec Guennis; stage: Jefferson Mays), and the leading character (Dennis Price in the film) is so suave and dapper that who could believe that he was really in the league of Tod Slaughter? Having been banished from his legacy of being part of a wealthy family because his mother married a commoner, Price seeks revenge in the most sinister of ways, and as a result, the body count increases. While the musical version utilizes farce to visualize the killings, the film is much more subtle in how it is done. In fact, you are hardly aware throughout most of the film that you are watching a comedy, and when you do laugh, they come out of irony rather than the silliness which makes the Broadway musical a genuine crowd pleaser.Alec Guennis could flip pancakes while reading the telephone book and make you laugh. Here, he's a variety of character, male and female, imperious and charming, yet each of them ends up with the same fate. Price makes his demon cousin so likable that you can't blame him for seeking at least some sort of retribution. There's no doubt in my mind that Guennis's one drag character certainly didn't look like a woman at all, yet there's poetry in the way Price dispatches of her, and there's irony in what finally catches the law up to him. British beauties Joan Greenwood and Valarie Hobson are both excellent eye candy and charmingly comic as they find themselves dragged into Price's web. Yes, the plot is certainly amoral, but when done with such droll charm and subtle sparkle through the eye of the killer, you can't help but find yourself mesmerized by the whole package.",

It is one of those old Black and Whites which at first glance you think is going to be another typical piece of 1940s British cinema. This opinion could not be further from the truth. In the 1940s, the majority of British Film released was heavy Drama, and Wartime films, things like Kind Hearts were entirely neglected. So I feel it is a nice break from your average piece of 40s film. There are so many little things about this film which combine to make it one of the most entertaining comedies I have seen. The naration of the lead is brilliant, and without it I feel the film would lose marks. I love the calm, collected and often hilarious way in which he goes through his story and all the terrible things he has done. The picture is totally charming, the cinematography and direction seems to capture the feel of what is supposed to be going on perfectly. I love the fact that the director often manages to give the film a look of charming and happy innocene, whilst the protagonist is in the process of some terrible deed. One particular scene sprigns to mind as the scene in which Henry D'Ascoyne dies. I love how our Hero sits calmy in the idyllic English countryside with his murder victims wife, calmly taking afternoon tea, and when he sees smoke from the explosion he makes some comment about burning leaves. Brilliant.The trial in the House Of Lords is one of my favourite scenes from the film, I again love the collectedness of the protagonist as he sits through his trial. I also really enjoy seeing the House of Lords being used as it should be, not ruined by these awful modernists. The film is awesome. The story is great, a man low down in the sucssesion trying to become Duke. What more could you want? It's a comedy, so I didn't expect well defined characthers and a finely tuned story, so was surprised to get one.The ending of the film is possibly one of the greatest and funniest film endings I have ever seen.

His performances in Lavender Hill Mob, The Man in the White Suit, Oliver Twist (1948), and The Bridge on the River Kwai are pretty much unmatched by anyone... except himself as eight characters in Kind Hearts and Coronets.

Their acting alone would have made watching this film indispensable to anyone who cares even slightly about films. But there are other treasures to it: There is a most enjoyable and eloquent use of the English language with possibly the quirkiest and cleverest dialogue I have ever chanced upon; wonderful diction by all (though in smaller parts, Joan Greenwood with her throaty voice and beautiful Valerie Hobson with her polished accent are too lovable for words); the satire of English aristocracy, its self-preserving immunity and its murderous values; the volatility of fate; and the most successful, witty, and intelligent twist ending I have ever seen. To cap it all, Director Robert Hamer is in his best form ever. The performances he extracts from his ensemble and his use of the camera are top drawer.

            "content": "One of the things I noticed on my first watch of Robert Hamer's Kind Hearts and Coronets (from the studio that later brought you The Ladykillers), is that it aims and achieves for much more than it could have. This could have been just a silly comedy about an ambitious man trying to reach his way to the top of the Duke-dom - specifically with the D'Ascoyne family, all played by Alec Guinness by the way - and it might have some edge to it but would be more about the funny make-up and outfits that Guinness puts on. But what makes it more is that there is a real film here, and attention is paid to supporting characters - especially the women, and another man named Lionel who will prove to be a big part of the plot - and it has the underlying air of a film noir: a criminal, the dames in his life, and narration leading the viewer along on the way.At the same time, Kind Hearts is a raucous satire of the upper class and nobility, and what it means to have privilege and status in society. Dennis Price plays Louis as a man who is nearly always with the utmost, upright character. He may be half Italian and half the son of an Italian singer (who, as we learn, dropped dead of a heart attack before he really knew him), but everything in his actions as he goes one by one in killing most of the D'Ascoynes is that of a complete gentlemen. If he wasn't so fervent about rising to the top in his calculating and homicidal manner, he might make for a great (if strict) teacher of manners for school-boys... which is part of the point: this is a society that prides manners, good speaking, poise, fashionable dress, and even Price's accent is just right. If he had the bad luck of being raised Cockney, he'd never make it through the front door of the Duke's home.Guinness is a performer-genius, and this is one of the films that shows that with riotous effect. Some of the characters may not even get much screen time, like the Admiral who goes down with the ship by going Port instead of Starbord (not one of Louis' victims, but what a way to go), or the Lady D'Ascoyne, who meets maybe the funniest end as she flies over the people promoting Women's rights in a hot air balloon (it shouldn't be funny, promoting women's rights, but when it's Guinness in a dress waving to the public, I'm sorry, I lost it). Maybe my favorite of his creations is the religious man, The Parson, who is one of the older figures, slow and yet loving to ramble and drag things along about the D'Ascoyne legacy in the church he works at, and watch as he is under no impression of fakery listening to Louis reciting some obscure language. Guinness may not look like it, but he's having the time of his life with these roles, going so far as to change his height when necessary, and it's surprising to see what he'll show up as next.In the more straightforward part of the story, this too is solid and goes along with the satirical part, if a little more leaning towards a conventional story. There's the two women in his life - one of them, a D'Ascoyne wife (soon to be ex), is actually admirable and attractive to Louis. It's interesting to see how our (anti)hero sees other people and actually does have respect for them (the one member of the family who dies of stroke he admits \"glad\" to have not had to kill), perhaps because they share the same upstanding manner of him, or have a sense of dignity in his warped perspective. Hobson is Edith, the (ex)D'Ascoyne, and is a pleasure to see on screen opposite Louis. The other woman is one who fancies him more than he does her, Sibella (Greenwood), maybe more of the 'femme fatale' of the story. She may have some level of dignity, but it's below Louis' standards, whatever those they may be. How she comes around at the end, however, is one of the more clever twists in all movies. I mean, ever.So much of Kind Hearts and Coronets is based upon the droll manner that becomes English society, specifically the 'noble' class, or even those who may be closer to \"working\" like the Photographer who imbibes in secret in his development room. In some ways this would make a good double feature with Chaplin's Monsieur Verdoux, also about a murderous character we grow to kinda love while also about class, but perhaps an even better comparison is with The Rules of the Game by Renoir. Deep down this is cunning, savage work on how for centuries the British have seen themselves, and I have to think this could only be done, at least this way, from the UK. We all know Royalty gets it way too good, they're up at the top, so a movie like this is practically necessary - a beautiful, cynical, and a dastardly tonic for everyone not of royalty, and right after WW2 to boot (though, who knows, maybe they love it as well, if only in secret).A lot of this is funny, but even if it's not it's captivating stuff. Even the \"Villain Monologue\" trope is not only acceptable but riveting.",

When they refuse him a position at the family bank he is forced to work in a clothes shop then when they refuse to let his mother be interred in the family vault he vows revenge\u0085 he will kill the eight D'Ascoyne's between himself and the dukedom.

Louis overhears him saying where they will be going for a few days; he goes there too and kills Ascoyne and the poor girl. He is quick to give his condolences to the family and soon is offered the post at the bank that he had been rejected for earlier. That doesn't stop his plans though and soon other D'Ascoynes are dead and he is getting closer to his ultimate goal.

Inevitably the police eventually catch up with him\u0085 but not for a death he had thought about.There are a lot of great Ealing Comedies but I think this is my favourite. The comedy is fairly dark but there are plenty of laughs to be had. This is largely down to Alec Guinness's brilliant performance as no less than eight members of the D'Ascoyne family; both young and old, even including Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne. Dennis Price is also great as Louis; his performance is such that it is easy to sympathise with this mass murderer as he coolly works his way to the Dukedom. His character isn't too likable though; he does have an affair with Sibella then, as he gets closer to the Dukedom, he decides she really isn't good enough. The rest of the cast are impressive too; most notably Joan Greenwood who plays Sibella; a character who proves to be surprisingly devious in the end. Overall I'd strongly recommend this to anybody who likes their comedy dark; it may be an old film but it still feels surprisingly fresh\u0085 possibly because it was set forty years in the past when it was made.",

In fact, looking back over the narrative, it's surprising how much Mazzini changes. At first, he's really sympathetic for being cut out of the snobbish family and watching his mother suffer as a result. But slowly, as he executes his vengeful scheme, he becomes more cold-blooded and even dislikable. This appears a neglected facet of the movie as a whole.What an inspiration having Guiness play all the D'Ascoyne offshoots. That way we avoid feeling guilty over each demise since it's so obviously tongue-in-cheek. On the other hand, I suspect the more realistic dispatch of the duke himself was done in order to emotionally justify Mazzini's eventual execution.Overall, the movie remains a marvel of astute craftsmanship, while Greenwood's coy little vixen remains a masterpiece of feminine amorality\u2014and catch those dress-up hats deployed like battleships on her head.

            "content": "While Alec Guinness justly deserves rave reviews for his eight brilliant characterizations in \"Kind Hearts,\" one must not overlook the brilliant performance of the lead, Dennis Price, one of the great character actors of the period.  Price, a genuine war hero in World War II, had a career that lasted for nearly 30 years, during which he played comic and serious roles with consummate skill.  No one could portray the arch, sophisticated rogue better than Price, as is evident not only in \"Kind Hearts\" but in another of my favorite comedies of the period \"The Naked Truth\" (1957, where he plays the elegant but sleazy tabloid editor/blackmailer, opposite the likes of Peter Sellers, Terry-Thomas, and Peggy Mount. He was very funny in a small role as the \"gentleman con man\" in Sellers' great hit of 1962, \"The Wrong Arm of the Law.\"   And for dramatic intensity one can point to his role of Major Charlie Scott in the gripping regimental drama, \"The Tunes of Glory.\" (1960).  So three cheers for Price as that charming rogue, \"Louis Mazzini,\" in \"Kind Hearts and Coronets.\"",

How sad that this was to be one of his only truly great performances, but what a fantastic film to be remembered for. Whilst Alec Guiness has received deserved praise over the years for his clever portrayal of all the members of the noble d'Ascoigne family, in my opinion the film belongs to Dennis Price. The support from the two leading ladies is also something to treasure. I just love the sultry-voiced Joan Greenwood as the delightfully selfish Sybella. If you have never seen this film, WHY NOT?",

            "content": "The grandson of a Duke whose mother married a commoner and was shunned by her relatives as a consequence, plots his revenge against the pompous D'Ascoyne family who spurned her so cruelly. One by one he bumps off the eight people whose bloodlines stand between him and the Dukedom, but a female admirer begins to suspect his schemes.Arguably the best of the great Ealing comedies, and one of the greatest black comedies ever made, this is a mannered, twisted, delicious peach of a film. As a piece of simple melodrama it would be entertaining enough, but its wit and satirical bite - Oscar Wilde meets Agatha Christie - elevates it to a near masterpiece. Price is unforgettable as the dastardly yet lovable Louis Mazzini; a man whose moral double-standards are both admirable and detestable. His smooth, measured delivery of some of the best British film dialogue ever written is a sheer delight. The rest of the cast are equally to be treasured, especially Greenwood as the vain, preening Sibella, whose hideous self-absorption is matched only by the ugliness of her hats. This movie is most famous however for Guinness' incredible Star Turn as the unfortunate D'Ascoynes - eight of them (a dandy, a banker, a photographer, a parson, a suffragette, a general, an admiral and a duke) - all of whom Price gleefully murders. Guinness is both amazing and amazingly funny; my favourite is the doddery old vicar (\"Sir, the port is with you.\"), but it's Price's movie all the way. Brilliantly written by Hamer and John Dighton (very loosely based on Roy Horniman's novel Israel Rank, with a title from Tennyson's Lady Clara Vere De Vere), with tremendous photography by Douglas Slocombe, this is an absolute gem of a picture, polished to perfection.",

So he brutally bumps them off one by one and gets nearer to the line of inheritance and at the same time his social and financial status elevates.This film is one of the well known Ealing comedies which has a dark heart. In fact the film opens in prison as Louis is facing the gallows which indicates that he might had not got away with his plans. Even then there are further twists to emerge as Louis complicated love live threatens to derail him.Although Guinness grabs the headlines this is Price's film and he is well supported by a sly, witty and literate script.",

            "content": "A man, who's mother was disowned by their aristocratic family, embarks on a campaign of bloody revenge.I think this is one of the best British films and funniest comedies I've ever seen. It has a strong plot, incredibly funny dialogue, great visuals and a number of superb performances.Considering it came out of Ealing studios in 1949, it's themes are jet black, touching on revenge, blackmail, infidelity, murder and death in general. The class system comes under intense satire with its caricatures embodied by a variety of performances. Moral codes are subverted and there is a strong sense of sexuality underlying many scenes. Most of this is done in the most dignified British way of course.The story has a dark and amusing premise with events unfolding in a series of quite sadistic interactions between Louis Mazzini and the members of the D'Ascoyne family. Most of it is narrated by Mazzini as he awaits the hangman's noose.We quickly learn that Mazzini isn't your typical movie protagonist. He is hell-bent on killing everyone who stands between him and succession to the title Duke of Chalfont. This ambition is so strong he is devoid of any conscience and even takes pleasure in most of it. He is almost a relic from the Middle Ages of feudal Britain, played with ice-cold contempt and hilarious wit by Dennis Price.The great Sir Alec Guinness gives fantastic support by co-staring in nine separate roles as various members of the D'Ascoyne family. His performances, along with the costumes and makeup work to make the concept plausible.Another notable performance is that of Joan Greenwood as Sibella, who is the very definition of the proverb 'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned'. It's not what she says, it's what she doesn't say with a look in her eyes that communicates to the audience exactly what she's thinking at crucial points in the story.What makes Kind Hearts And Coronets special is the dialogue. Everything said both in narration and conversation between characters is beautifully written. Characters speak very elegantly but what they say is layered with dark cynicism and brilliant irony. If you appreciate humour on display, you should find it prolifically funny throughout its running time. If the humour is not to your taste, it could be a long 106 minutes of posh, upper class English banter. I say this because comedy as always is a very subjective genre.From a technical perspective, I think it has strong examples of cinematography and editing. From the outset there are excellently composed shots with atmospheric lighting. There are many beautiful landscapes of the English countryside and great transitions between scenes.It all ends in the most ironic and atypical way for a movie made in an era where strict moral codes were usually observed during filmmaking. The last few seconds and final image for me are an all time classic sequence.A word of warning that some of the dialogue is a product of its time. In particular I refer to a use of the racist version of the nursery rhyme \"Eeny, meeny, miny, moe\" and a follow-up use of that same slur in the next sentence of dialogue. Take heart in knowing that societies have moved on since then with modern writers and audiences knowing it to be offensive and unacceptable. However, this probably feels more significant than it should in a movie centred around mass-murder.",

The Ladykillers from the same team later provided more in the way of slapstick. I've just read the comments from some of the haters on here and found them most illuminating \u2013 however kind words are more than criticisms in my case.A poor distant relation in a large rich family determines to get rid of all in the way of his succession to the family fortune by foul means. This involves the murder of eight Alec Guinness's which is taken to with gusto, and with some success. It was the urbane Dennis Price's finest performance, the one for which he'll be remembered, and coquettish Joan Greenwood played her heart out too. As for Guinness, his various performances have gone down in film history, although most of the collection were merely walk on parts. The plot and dialogue was incessantly erudite, witty and thought-provoking, the entire film sparkles with ingenuity. The attention to detail was total, and the elegant photography of it all by Douglas Slocombe was too. The American end version was interesting but unnecessary as the ultimate retribution was clear and clearly impending. The nword used was unnecessary but normal as part of the then popular children's rhyme and simply reflects back to us a time when white people could use that word unthinkingly; nowadays lovely premeditated obscenity and profanity is the accepted norm for all. The scheming Greenwood suggesting the possibility of the two dependent miracles to the scheming Price in the interview room are the money shots for me, it's the mesmerising logical culmination of the intelligent script.Imho it's almost perfect in every department and really beyond all criticism as completely in a league of its own as a unique work of Art.",

            "content": "In the decade after WW-II, Ealing Studios (UK) produced many droll comedies, several starring Guinness; \"KH&C\" is probably its most famous (and blackest) comedy. It's a delightful satire on the British emphasis of class, class deference, & appropriate ritual manners with class, etc., set around the beginning of the 20th century, just after the Victorian era.Dennis Price has the lead role as Louis Mazzini, a VERY distant heir to the Dukedom of Chalmont, inherited through the D'Ascoyne family line. His mother, a D'Ascoyne, married an Italian singer for love and not status and, for that reason, was disinherited, disowned.Louis has scarcely even a remote chance of inheriting the title--there are a dozen D'Ascoynes ahead of his position of inheritance.BUT, some accidents happen; Louis becomes sufficiently ticked off by some of the D'Ascoyne haughtiness that he starts doing away with many of those standing between him and the title.Alec Guinness, certainly one of the great actors of all times, plays eight different members of the D'Ascoyne family (one a female) varying in age from maybe 35 to 90. His changes of voice, facial expression, posture, movements, etc., so perfectly fit each character he's incredible.Dennis Price in the lead role (Louis Mazzini) was excellent and holds everything together: whether as a lad of 16, a ladies' underwear salesman at 25, or an upwardly climbing society member, he fit his roles precisely. A very young Joan Greenwood was a great vamp. \"KH&C\" is called a \"black comedy.\" While that's true, I think the emphasis should be on the comedy rather than the black. No scenes of murder are seen, only their build-up and consequences.This film was made in the late '40s, long before awareness about racial stereotypes arose. Thus its nonchalant use of the original child's rhyme \"Eeenie, meenie, meinnie mow.........\" rhyme is a sign of what was acceptable in those times, NOT of now.Out of 10 stars, I'd give it 9 3/4. A must see movie, a classic.P.S. -- We saw the Criterion Collection DVD which gave the world-wide ending rather than the original version made for the USA which, in those years, was governed by the Hays Code; this code prohibited ANY hint of receiving a benefit from committing a crime. The non-USA ending is FAR more preferable.ALSO, if you have optional subtitles available for the hearing impaired (as in the Criterion version), consider using them. The film's British accents sometimes make British speech unclear to American ears not used to it.",

He is pushed over the edge when he has a run-in with one of his distant relatives and loses his job, and for revenge he ends up causing the relative a fatal boat accident that has the effect of embarrassing the relative after death. Then he gets the idea of wiping out the rest of his relatives until he can get the noble title himself, though in doing so, his intentions do not go unnoticed.Alec Guinness plays each relative, so it tends to soften the idea of their being murdered (you see the same person again and again), and the killings are done in clever ways, which has the same effect.

Robert Hamer both directed and co-adapted the screenplay from a novel by Roy Horniman; he keeps a steady pace and doesn't allow Guinness to be hammy or to overwhelm the scenario (a few of the actor's incarnations are seen only in cameo, which helps). There are definite flaws in the storytelling, particularly in the lack of an investigation after one character is killed (by an exploding jar of caviar!).

Along with Price's remarkable performance Alec Guiness is also outstanding playing no less than nine separate character (all members of the noble family). The film has a similar tone and style to the aforementioned Ladykillers and if you liked that you will certainly be at home with this. The humour is dark and full of wit a satire on the class system in England at the time (which in some areas is still in effect today).

I love the nonchalant-yet-somehow-not-disturbing way in which Dennis Price delivers commentary on the task he has undertaken. He makes the whole thing seem so perfectly reasonable. I've never laughed so loudly at murder in my life. Nor could I tolerate a remake.

Tell her that I have gone to avenge her wrongs, and will return only as the messenger of punishment and death.'The aria by Don Octavio from Mozart's Don Giovanni which plays over the opening titles and during the early scene sets the tone for the film perfectly. By providing a subtle accompaniment to a sequence of events that occur prior to the birth of the narrator \u2013 Dennis Price as Louis Mazzini, first viewed from behind in a prison cell whilst awaiting death by hanging \u2013 it recalls Don Giovanni's ultimate fate for his refusal to repent of his past sins.The story of the immediate past of Louis's parents unfolds in the film's unhurried, languid manner and provides the main reason as to just why he set out as he did to avenge his dead mother, an erstwhile member of the titled D'Ascoyne family: she was ostracised for having had the temerity to put love before a life of rank and privilege and married an opera singer. The more the story unfolds, the more the protagonist Dennis Price seems to cast aside the role of being simply the harbinger of death and becomes more the principal: having made the fateful step upon the path of revenge he seems to grow in worldly power and malevolent influence as he draws nearer to his ultimate goal of becoming the tenth Duke of Chalfont, with the result that he reveals himself to be more and more truly a member of the D'Ascoyne family, in manner and in character, one that he presumed to despise so much.Price is magnificent. His mellifluous and studied voice with its pitch, flourishes and aspirated delivery is a joy to listen to, ideally suited to the film's first person narrative and its Edwardian appeal. He gives a performance of such refined charm and genteel good manners that the listener becomes inevitably and completely entranced, happily paying little or no heed to the contrasting nature of his murderous and vengeful behaviour. Always ready with either a bon mot or an anecdote, has there ever been a wittier, more humorous or more sympathetic villain? Kind Hearts and Coronets simply drips with irony, understatement, drollness and humour of a deliciously dark kind \u2013 which is due in no small part to the brilliance of the screenplay. The director (and co-writer) Robert Hamer had his finger on the pulse of the late Victorian/Edwardian era to such an extent one would feel that he was plucked directly from either one of its garden parties or its many cricket matches. His use of the period language and his awareness of that era's social nuances combine effortlessly and flawlessly to describe that carefree time, so soon to vanish, enjoyed between the turn of the 20th century and the start of the First World War. Based upon the novel 'Israel Rank' by Roy Horniman, the film is enacted by a cast who unite to confer a series of excellent performances upon the audience. From Alec Guiness's superb turn as successively ill-fated members of the D'Ascoyne family \u2013 done away with by either good fortune or in inventive manner \u2013 to the inimitable portrayals by Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood of womanhood, both sacred and profane, and those minor but no less important roles of Miles Malleson, Clive Morton and Audrey Fildes amongst others, all of whom deserve praise for work that can still be appreciated for its sheer craftsmanship more than half a century after its inception.

Dennis Price as the vengeful, amoral (yet, in his own way, strangely moral) Louis Mazzini turns in a fantastic, beautiful, even sympathetic performance. (Would you believe *sympathetic?*) He is complemented--though not overshadowed--by the inimitable Alec Guinness in eight roles as members of the D'Ascoyne family. And Joan Greenwood is every bit Price's conniving equal as Sibella. I should also mention that the script is mind-boggling. It's all nasty stuff covered up by Victorian gentility. Scathing attack on nobility, too. Also on folks who seem to miss the point about art (like Guinness' portrayal of the priest).I'm running out of ways to express my enjoyment of the film, but I'd like to make a final point. I read a comment allegedly attributed to Lindsay Anderson that indicated the movie's visuals didn't live up to the screenplay. Just want to respectfully disagree. I believe the visuals were perfectly suited to the film, as they framed the action perfectly, called attention to the comic moments without creating any distractions (via camera or otherwise) and provided clean, clear visuals. In other words, a perfect appearance for a nearly perfect comedy. The strong editing also helped. So, while this is not a visually innovative film on the level of, say, \"Citizen Kane\" or \"Battleship Potemkin,\" it doesn't need to be...nor should it be.

I didn't have to look very far, my public library has the DVD, and a superb DVD it is. The picture is amazingly nice for a 50+ year old movie, and has an interesting 'extra' which chronicles the film career of Sir Alec Guinness, who early in his attemps was told, 'You'll never make it as an actor.'  I watched it, fully expecting it to be overrated, as many other classic B&W movies are, but boy was I in for a surprise. 'Kind Hearts and Coronets', a dark comedy of revenge and murder, is one of the better movies I've seen in recent months, regardless of age or genre. All the actors create memorable characters, but it is Guinness, playing all eight characters of the doomed D'Ascoyne family, from a naive 24-year-old to a minister in his 80s, plus one woman, that gives the most memorable performance. That alone would make this movie worth watching, but it is much more. Anyone who hasn't seen it yet should give it a try, a true classic comedy.The rest of my comments contain some SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS, please read no further, under penalty of possible disillusionment.The movie starts with Luis Mazzini in his prison cell, preparing to be executed the next morning at 8AM, and beginning to write his memoirs, in case anyone would want to read then. The movie is then told as a flashback. One potential D'Ascoyne heir to the Dukeship, a woman, married an Italian tenor who died young but left a son, Luis Mazzini, potential heir if everyone between him and the current Duke were to die. Angered when his mum died and her remains were denied burial in the D'Ascoyne family cemetary, he became obsessed with revenge. he had a plan, and a family tree pasted to the rear of a picture hanging on his bedroom wall.  As heirs died, he would gleefully cross them off. Not to leave too much to chance, he decided that killing them off would be appropriate. Alec Guinness played each of the seven heirs to be eliminated, plus the Duke, each uniquely. The first came when the man and his sweetie were on a boat, tied, in a canal, Luis untied the boat right at 2PM, when the overflow would suck them over a dam to their death. The next, he bought photographic equipment to attract the photo buff, gained his confidence, substituted petrol for paraffin, and had tea with the wife as her husband burned to death in his darkroom. He had just killed his bosses son, then got a raise and new position, and also decided to court the deceased son's widow, the pretty and sophisticated Edith. Meanwhile, his first love had married someone who she later confided was the most boring man in all of Europe, so began sneaking to Luis's apartment for discrete affairs.The next D'Ascoyne to go down was the old minister, slipping poison into his sherry. Then, an arrow to the hot air ballon of Lady D'Ascoyne did her in. An Admiral went down with his ship, saving Luis the trouble of rubbing him out. To a General, he sent a bomb in the caviar. Then Luis' boss, a D'Ascoyne also, made Luis partner, then died shortly after, eliminating the need for another murder. Now only the Duke remained. In a visit there, he led the Duke into a 'man trap', then shot his with his own gun before running for help, claiming that an intruder run off earlier had returned.\nSo, with everyone else gone, Luis Mazzini became rightful heir, had his coronation as Duke at the elegant castle, the widow Edith had finally accepted his proposal, and surely the spurned lover, Sibella, would cause trouble. Especially after her own husband Lionel, bankrupt, turned up dead after Luis, also his banker, refused to extend another loan. An uninvited guest at his coronation was from Scotland Yard, Luis was arrested for Lionel's murder. At trial, he was to his surprise found guilty, partly because Sibella testified that there was no suicide note. The spurned lover now had her revenge, and Luis who got away with six murders, now was destined to be executed for one that he did not commit. Lionel really did kill himself with the large knife to the chest.Sibella visited Luis the night before his scheduled execution. They spoke in 'code', about a possible miracle, maybe a suicide note would show up, maybe somehow Edith would die and Luis could then be reunited properly with Sibella. The next morning, as Luis is being led out of his cell, having written his complete memoirs overnight, explaining everything we see during the movie, a guard shows up hurrying to say, 'Wait, a suicide note was found, the execution is put on hold.' Shortly we see Luis exit the prison, a heavy metal gate closing behind him, a small crowd is cheering his release, and two carriages wait, to the right, his wife Edith, and to the left, his former lover Sibella. As his mind is working frantically to come up with the best solution, a reporter approaches him, 'Duke Mazzini, the newspaper wants to know if you will write your memoires?' Luis' expression changes, the view switches to the table in his recently vacated cell, his completed tell-all memoirs on the table, and he cannot get to them. All he can speak is, 'My memoirs!'  THE END.",

            "review_title": "Masterful British film of a dark, sophisticated comedy with crime and subtle satire",
            "content": "\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" is a dark and sophisticated comedy and crime film that is packed with subtle satire. It is based on a 1907 book by English novelist and playwright Roy Horniman (1874-1930). The novel was \"Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal.\" This is a masterful production with an outstanding cast of principal players - Alec Guinness, Dennis Price, Joan Greenwood and Valerie Hobson.The title for the film comes from a line in an 1842 poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson, \"Lady Clara Vere de Vere.\" Hobson's Edith introduces it when she says to Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, \"Was Lord Tennyson far from the mark when he wrote, 'Kind hearts are more than coronets, and simple faith than Norman blood?'\" Translated, that means it's better to be a good person than to have stature and wealth.The film has a clever way of playing the story out. Guinness and/or Price narrate the background from the memoirs that Louis has just finished writing while in prison, and this goes from one flashback to another. With such a cunning way of storytelling - and the known plot of Louis setting out to knock off his relatives, it's quite easy to miss the subtlety of the satire. One imagines Louis to be a cold and calculating criminal, who is out to revenge the D'Ascoyne's terrible treatment of his mother. Yet, one can see a love for his mother, and his charm not only seems disarming, but appears genuine in dealing with most others - i.e., common folks. Having worked and scraped in the trades and common society, he doesn't look down on real people or the tenants of the dukedom he inherits. So, this person who would acquire a title and position by crime would turn out to be a much better person toward most of society than are those whom he would knock off. Could there be such a thing as a soft-hearted psychopath? Maybe justice will work out for all in the end.This film is considered by many to be Alex Guinness's tour de force in cinema. It was early in his film career, and the great Guinness would go on to make many more outstanding films. While he made a name for himself in England and then the U.S. for his sophisticated comedy, he excelled as well in some later dramatic roles. That includes his Oscar-winning performance in one of the greatest war movies ever made, \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" of 1957. He was somewhat reintroduced to younger generations who may remember him most as Obi-Wan Kenobi from the \"Star Wars\" trilogy.Guinness's eight roles in this film are a masterful achievement; and for many years, he stood as the unquestioned king of the hill for multiple roles in a single movie. Over the years, various actors have tried films in which they played multiple roles. But the only really successful one after Guinness has been Peter Sellers in two huge film successes. He played three roles each in \"The Mouse that Roared\" of 1959 and \"Dr. Strangelove\" of 1964. While some actors have sought films with multiple roles in the 21st century, there hasn't been a major film made with a single player having more than eight roles. A 2012 film, \"Cloud Atlas,\" had two dozen actors playing multiple roles - some playing half a dozen roles including stars Tom Hanks and Halle Berry.While Guinness gets the accolades for his multiple roles here, Dennis Price turns in an excellent role as Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini. Price had several good films early in his career, but after a couple of flops, he began boozing. He appeared in many films and on TV, including some smash British comedies. But he never got lead roles and with his drinking his last years were spent in horror flicks and other lesser films. He was just 58 when he died after suffering a hip fracture. Various sources report his death due to heart failure or cirrhosis of the liver.The two female leads are very good - Valerie Hobson as Edith and Joan greenwood as Sibella. Greenwood was just 66 when she died of a heart attack. Hobson lived to be 81, but she quite films just five years after this one - at age 37, and married British politician John Profumo in 1954. The trivia section under Hobson's biography on IMDB has some interesting details about the sex scandal that Profumo was part of in 1963.Here are some favorite lines from this film. For more witty dialog, see the Quotes section under this IMDb Web page of the film.Mr. Elliott, the hangman, \"Even my lamented master, the great Mr. Barry himself, never had the privilege of hanging a duke.\"Mr. Elliott, the hangman, \"Yes, I intend to retire. After using this silken rope - never again be content with hemp.\"Mr. Elliott, the hangman, \"The last execution of a duke in this country was badly bungled. But that was in the old days of the ax, of course.\"Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, \"No, I forgot. You're pledged to Lionel. I behaved like a cad that night.\" Sibella, \"I liked you when you behaved like a cad.\"Edith D'Ascoyne, \"But I have often felt that the attitude of my husband's family has failed to move with the times. That they think too much of the rights of the nobility and too little of its duties. The very honesty of your behavior would appear to me to prove them wrong.\"Louis, \"The D'Ascoynes certainly appear to have accorded with the tradition of the landed gentry, and sent the fool of the family into the church. \"Sibella, \"Louis, I think I've married the most boring man in London.\" Louis, \"In England.\" Sibella, \"In Europe.\"Sibella, after kissing Louis and backing away, \"What am I doing?\" Louis, \"You know very well. You're playing with fire.\"",

            "content": "Dennis Price plays a young man who murders his way through his bloodline to become a duke. The brilliant Alec Guinness, who has given so many great performances outside of Star Wars, superbly plays 8 roles and dies 8 times. It's not like modern comedies at all, but Kind Hearts and Coronets doesn't feel dated. It's not your typical laugh out loud comedy. It's conveyed in a very dry, detached way, but it's very funny in an incredibly dark way. Admittedly, there are times when you don't know whether you're meant to laugh or not but it still has loads of genuinely funny moments. This is a film which actually manages to make murder funny, but what's most impressive about it, aside from the great performances, is the social commentary. The main character is pretty despicable, yet he is sympathetic and the moment where he confronts the last victim and explains his motives is actually very moving as well as blackly comic. This is an excellent mix of drama and humour, and it is easily one of the darkest comedies ever made. The fact that it manages to make such dark material so entertaining and do so in such a clever way solidifies the film's position as one of the definitive Ealing comedies.9/10",

However, in this movie it was done in such a way that Mazzini could easily get his memoirs back without them being read by anyone else.I would recommend this film to anyone and suggest you watch it at the next available opportunity.",

It's best remembered today for featuring numerous performances from Alec Guinness playing no less than eight members of the same family (females too). Guinness is clearly having a ball and the resultant film is a lot of fun to watch, although tame by modern standards.

Although the theme is outrageously immoral and impossible, you must love this film for its very high quality of intellectual sport, which the dialogue sustains all the way.

The movie begins with the Duke in prison, who is to be sent to the gallows the next day. The Duke narrates the movie as he pens his auto-biography. It is a wonderfully-written and brilliantly-acted movie in which every main character or the characters that the main character chooses to terminate are all played by one single man, Alec Guinness. The murders are carefully plotted and executed insidiously, the humor is sensible, timely and concurrent to the crime. The movie has its portion of 'twists and turns' and the way the movie culminates couldn't have been better. The movie may not be a laughter riot but the humor, i reiterate, is sensible, timely and concurrent to the crime.

All of the characters he portrays wind up dead, which is probably an all time record in movies for one actor. Usually someone of his caliber would have reservations about dying just once in a picture, so you have to give the man some credit. The film's pace probably wouldn't be for everyone, but if you go for the dry wit and sarcasm, there's a lot to wrap your head around here. The dialog, particularly that of Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price) talking to himself and the viewer, is quintessentially suited for his murderous heart, as he plots the death of all the potential Dukes (and one Duchess) of Chalfont.

            "content": "Instead of the usual warm comedy, contemporary setting and familiar cast of lower-middle class worthies, 'Kind Hearts and Coronets' is set in the 1860s and shot through with pitch black humor and biting satire on both the moribund upper class and the grasping venality of the suburban middle class.A waspishly poised Dennis Price plays Louis Mazzini whose mother was cast out from the aristocratic D'Ascoyne family for marrying an Italian opera singer. After her death and a series of provocations from his estranged relatives - mainly their refusal to let her be buried at Chalfont in the D'Ascoyne family crypt, Louis embarks on a plan to murder his way into his inheritance, knocking off eight D'Ascoyne heirs (all played with great relish by Alec Guinness) one by one, in a series of wonderfully absurd set pieces - even polishing off one of his kinsmen, a windy general, by putting dynamite in his caviar. Louis only finds his match in his childhood sweetheart from the suburbs, the vulgar and scheming Sibella. Matters get complicated when he falls in love with Hobson, the widow of one of his victims. But after Price ascends to the dukedom and marries Hobson, fate catches up and something startling ensues.In this delicious little satire on Edwardian manners and morals, the sly and adroit Mr. Guinness plays eight Edwardian fuddy-duds with such devastating wit and variety that he naturally dominates the film. He scores an eightfold tour de force as every member \u2013 young, old, male, female \u2013 of the D'Ascoyne clan, adding an additional masterstroke to the ruthlessly pitched satire about British imperialism backfiring on itself. He's aptly matched by Dennis Price as the Byronic anti-hero, who coolly undertakes a monstrous scheme of killing off all his kinfolk in order to succeed to the family coronet.But don't let this obvious admiration for the leads obscure the fact that the picture itself is a sparkling, devilishly cutting jest. Robert Hamer's poised direction chimes perfectly with his Edwardian setting. He directs the script as a story being narrated as the recollections of a candid scoundrel - the Wildean wit of Price's voice-over an unfailing delight - and the whole development of the scoundrel's calculated career - in this case, of civilized murder - is described in the finest spirit of Gallic wit. Such a story of unmitigated contempt for the fundamental laws or society could only be tolerable when played as a spoof - a spoof on the highest level of cultivated humor and device.The result, Kind Hearts and Coronets, is one of those films that can be seen repeatedly and still offer surprises. As a combination of rollicking black humor and satirical pokes at the English upper crust, nothing else comes close.",

Alec Guiness plays a string of funny roles, Dennis Price is more than adequate as angry young man, and Joan Greenwood is just fabulous, period.The story of the bastard son who, much aided by circumstance and sheer luck, is thoroughly amusing in the black comedy way, even if it does become a long string of killings at some point. Then, near the end, some intrigue and twists make for a worthy finale.The best part of the whole is probably the writing; very British and understated, yet very eloquent, and very accurate in capturing the gist of all things, be it bitter, sweet, bittersweet, ironic, dark or other. A good reason for me to watch this one over and over, because I certainly did not catch all of it perfectly, not even this second time around.A good 8 out of 10.",

            "content": "The movie starts with Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price) the Duke of D'Ascoyne in prison on the verge of execution. Then the movie flashes back as he narrates his life story. He has always resented his mother's family who shunned her for running away with an Italian commoner. Her family even refuses to allow her to be buried in the family vault. As a young man, Sibella refuses his proposal of marriage to such a poor man. Then he is fired from his lowly job as a draper's assistant after an altercation with Ascoyne D'Ascoyne. He decides to take the title of the Duke of D'Ascoyne by killing all other heirs in front of him.The movie is best known for Alec Guinness who plays all the D'Ascoyne heirs, 8 characters in total. One of my pet peeves has always been overly long unnecessary narration. The problem here is the long low energy narration that acts as Louis' inner voice. It takes away all the tension. It is fascinating to see Alec Guinness play each character with personality. This is a vicious skewering of the English class system. Dennis Price does a fair job but I can't take the almost constant narration.",

The comedy is all the blacker because each ghastly crime is quaintly executed with a self-mocking delicacy.The performances are exquisite - Joan Greenwood's darkly seductive Sibella makes audiences fully understand why the hero is led astray. The dialogue both aspires to poetry and is the very definition of wit. As with the plays of Wilde and Shaw, the comedy does not date. The film's structure is as Byzantine and elegant as the murders themselves.The integrity of the drama almost causes us to miss the tour-de-force eight role performance of Alec Guiness forging a gem-like collection of bitter-sweet satires on the English character.Historically, the film is one of the series of quality comedies emerging from the British Ealing Studios. However, in true character it is unlike all the others, possessing the one-off quality of genius. It appears to juggles irreconcilable contradictions. It is a comedy with an outrageous plot; yet the drama is compelling and credible. It is a stagey production, based on mannered dialogue; yet it is a genuine classic of pure cinematic.This film is one of the few I can watch again and again - in the way I can listen repeatedly to musical perfection. It is chronically undervalued (except by all who have seen it) both in its country of origin and especially in the rest of the world.David John Johnston",

            "content": "\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" is a truly remarkable dark comedy that not only boasts a legendary eight part performance by Sir Alec Guinness, but explores a plot that we idealistic Westerners would never dare touch. This film dares to address a widely ignored fact: that adversity does not always make us stronger, better people, but can make us petty, vindictive, bitter, and completely devoid of basic morals.Our film's antihero is verbose, narcissistic Louis Manzzini (Dennis Price), who is awaiting his own execution for the murders of eight members of the d'Ascoyne family. That's the \"what\" of the story\u0085 the \"who\" and \"why\" are revealed as the Manzzini, ever the egotist, jots down his memoirs in his jail cell. Manzzini's mother, it is revealed, was once part of the d'Ascoyne family but was disowned for marrying beneath her class (to a tenor, no less!). As a result, she is forced to raise Louis in poverty and never lets him forget her misfortune. Louis's frustrations in life come to a head when his mother dies and his true love Sibella, a smarmy gold digger, dumps him for a dull but wealthy beau. When Louis discovers he's technically ninth in line for the title of Duke d'Ascoyne, he schemes to kill off each successor one by one until he gets what's rightfully his (his job is made a little easier when one dies from illness). That's where Sir Alec Guinness comes in. In a chameleon-like performance that puts Peter Sellers's in \"Dr. Strangelove\" to shame, he plays all eight of Louis's victims, including a fisherman, a photographer, and even a feminist (in which he bears a startling resemblance to Susan B. Anthony). When Louis murders the photographer (by planting explosives in his darkroom), he perversely woos his widow, the lovely and morally upright Edith (Valerie Hobson). Louis is so cool and calculating that it comes as no surprise when he gets what he wants. What he doesn't count on, though, is an unpleasant hindrance known as karma\u0085 What a deliciously dark comedy this is! Price really walks a fine line with Louis. You hate him for being such loathsome, shortsighted, murderous mama's boy. One even hates Louis's mother for instilling his appalling sense of entitlement with her self indulgent, woe-is-me attitude toward their situation. At the same time you have to admire his witticisms and his carefully plotted murders. They range from simplistic (trapping an avid hunter in a bear trap and shooting him) to hilarious (one is riding a hot air balloon and Louis nonchalantly shoots an arrow at it, causing it to plummet). There's also no contrivance where Louis sees the light or is transformed by the love of a good woman. You don't buy his romance with Edith for a second: you know she's both the rebound girl for Sibella and a trophy for his killing. I won't give away too much, but Louis does get exactly what he deserves, just not in the way you'd expect.One of the greatest films of all time, this is the twisted tale of how revenge isn't just a dish best served cold, as Louis points out, but sprinkled with arsenic.",

There are many wonderful comic moments: Mazzini's first encounter with a member of the D'Ascoyne family at a haberdashery/clothes shop, resulting in his dismissal - which works as the straw that broke Mazzini's patience, is something to savour.All murders happen in highly darkly comic manner, but those of the photographer, of Lady D'Ascoyne, of the Church of England priest who is baffled by Price's African tribe lingo, and of the admiral who sinks with his ship are absolutely unforgettable.Kind hearts. The man in the white suit, dead of night. Lavender hill mob and the lady killers are all superb examples of the Ealing Studios at their best - but KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS is in a class of its own in terms of style, sophistication, cruel wit and sting in the tail ending.I pity the minds of those who dump this baby with 5 stars and less. They should not watch anything except Stallone, Norris, Statham, Neeson, Schwarzenegger and other action clones explode, shoot, and kick everyone to bits. Anything requiring a bit of thinking, and a chuckle instead of a belly laugh is clearly beyond them.Must-see masterpiece that deserves 20 out of 10.",

In this case we have one actor (not a great one) playing all the murdered people. We have a double blackmail plot and we have the gimmick that attracts me: The story is presented as a book that is read as it is written about past events. We see those events in a slightly comic telling.Then the movie ends. Except the hero walks away from the book which now will factor in the story that follows what we see, and we know it will be his undoing. There is nothing along the way other than this. It still is the case that the financiers of a movie will base the whole thing on a few gimmicks like this and assume that with moderate quality elsewhere it will pass. Comedy is particularly prone to this problem.The reason such a thing happens is not because how films are financed. I thought it would be thus, because financiers need a few phrases on which to bet the farm. But I discovered that the studios at least had people with pretty deep awareness of the whole composition and why it might work.No, I discovered, these gimmicks come from the shorthand used to coordinate all the players and the artistic team.

Movies like \"Fight Club\" and \"Ocean's Eleven\" are popular because they depict clever, marginalized heroes who take on \"the man.\"  But I'm not on board with this subversive formula unless the rebel is a very sympathetic protagonist; there's nothing worse than a movie that glorifies a criminal's behavior for no particular reason.Thankfully, \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" features the most complex and compelling anti-hero I've ever seen - Louis Mazzini, a rebel with a cause. He sets out to avenge his mother's death by murdering every member of the noble family that wronged her.  He's a wholly evil b**tard but I root for him anyway, because he's fighting snobbery and privilege, and because he's so smart that it's impossible not to admire him.It's amazing to see a movie this old pushing so many envelopes.  There's innuendo aplenty in the scenes involving Louis and his lover Sibella, and some very \"modern\" black comedy related to the murders.

This is a very good movie.It is about a man who grows up knowing that his family disowned his mother because of who she married... but when she passes away, he wants to get revenge on them all for the way the treated her... so he kills them all one by one.The film stars Dennis Price as Louis. Dennis does a fantastic job... he is such a smooth character and even though he is on death row, stays calm through the movie and just writes him memoir. The film also stars Valerie Hobson & Joan Greenwood. These actresses were also very good. Joan played such a horrible woman in this film. At first you start to like her, but then her true colours come out. But the star of the movie has to be Alec Guinness. Alec plays 8 characters in this film. and he does them all brilliantly. He plays young men, old men and even a woman... but he is convincing in all the roles he takes on. The more I see of Alec, the more I think he was a great actor and not just Ben Kenobi in Star Wars.The film was made in 1949, so as you can imagine, the effects were not great, but for the time I can imagine they were very good. You can clearly see that the grave yard scene was just a huge picture background. Also, you can see that the boat scene are model boats. But it does not ruin the movie... if anything it makes the movie better because it shows it's age.The other thing I like about this film is it is the perfect length... i hour 40 minutes.

            "content": "Kind Hearts and Coronets is one of the very finest of the Ealing Comedies, and also one of the darkest. Loosely based on Roy Horniman's novel Israel Rank: The Autobiography of a Criminal, it is the blackest of black comedies, following as it does a protagonist who murders the members of his upper class family one by one in order to inherit a Dukedom.\nDirector Robert Hamer co-wrote the screenplay with John Dighton and whilst the result is not the funniest Ealing Comedy, it is the most wickedly amusing and arguably the cleverest. It's a social satire swathed in irony and dripping with bone dry humour, right from the opening scene in which hangman Miles Malleson gleefully looking forward to ending his career with the hanging of a peer of the realm, Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, 10th Duke of Chalfont, for murder. The film's framing sequence sees Louis writing - and narrating - his memoirs and detailing exactly how he set about planning to murder his D'Ascoyne family relatives and how he brought about each death.\nIt is, remarkably, a comedy in which we are invited to sympathise with a serial killer. The characterisation of the manipulative Louis as a charismatic psychopath who constantly justifies his actions is a remarkably believable piece of writing. For all that he claims to be motivated by revenge for the treatment of his mother by their snobby relatives this is a film about class warfare, social status and avarice. The D'Ascoyne's are not portrayed as innocent victims, but as pompous buffoons, oblivious to everything but their own blinkered interests. Whilst the script stops short of saying that they deserve to die, it depicts them as outdated, pointless and shallow. The irony of course is that in killing them off, Louis becomes them, his social status increasing with each murder as he rises near to the Dukedom. The film's crowning irony comes when we learn that Louis is awaiting execution not for murdering his relatives, but for a murder that he didn't commit. Equally ironically, Louis habit of manipulating women for his own game is reversed when he is out-manipulated by the equally scheming Sibella, who having put the rope around his neck blackmails him with the means to remove it.\nDennis Price gives an underrated performance as the Louis, proving alarmingly believable as the killer whom nobody suspects because he's so well mannered and charming. He is only underrated because the entire film is stolen by Alec Guinness, who famously plays nine members of the D'Ascoyne family and makes each one convincingly different: it's one of cinema's greatest comic performances, and a great showcase for Guinness' legendary acting talents. But the whole cast impresses, from John Penrose, who gives a convincing drunken performance as Lionel, to Joan Greenwood as femme fatale Sibella.\nHamer's directing - appropriately enough - is almost reminiscent of film noir in the opening scenes, and he does an impressive job as director, creating a film that remains handsome and elegantly executed. Douglas Slocombe's cinematography certainly helps. There is a particularly accomplished scene in the church when six versions of Guinness appear on screen together. The Kentish location filming - including Leeds castle - is perfectly chosen and meshes seamlessly with the sets, and there are masterly touches throughout, such as the fact that Louis' changing costumes as the film progresses reflect his changing social status.\nKind Hearts and Coronets does not provide belly laughs, but it will amuse and amaze with its audacity, its penetrating social satire, and its gleeful willingness to try and make the audience root for an unapologetic murderer. The British Film Institute included it within the top ten of its list of the one hundred greatest British films of the twentieth century: it is quite easy to understand why.",

Hilarious black comedy!I noticed another review that complimented the film by calling it \"Quaint\". Although I'm pleased that the reviewer liked it, \"quaint\" just doesn't do it for me. The humour in this film is timeless. \"Quaint\" is what you call 'The Belles of St. Trinians' or something.

Guinness has nowhere nearly as much screen time as Dennis Price, who plays a vengeful family outcast who decides to murder the eight other family members standing between him and a dukeship. Though Guinness plays all eight of the doomed relatives, he doesn't get much time as any of them, and he doesn't give them the colorful characterizations I was expecting. The film is humorous at times, but quite slow and even rather boring at others. It's capped by a clever ending, but overall the movie is not the masterpiece it's been hyped up to be.Grade: B+",

I only hope that Hollywood keeps its hands off this film and does not remake it.

            "content": "- This review DOES contain lots of spoilers but the film is not about the plot or story - -My (new) son-in-law visited for Christmas, saw the well-thumbed DVD case in my film rack and asked what Kind Hearts was like. There was only one thing to do: put it on.He was entranced and it made me a little jealous that I will never see the film for the first time again, to be overwhelmed by its script, the acting and the subtleties.For its time it was very close to the mark sexually. The 'fate worse than death' comment when concern was expressed over what we would now call collateral damage, and the 'I know' when it was remarked how lucky the man marrying his mistress was, were very risqu\u00e9 for the time. The eight murders were not thought to be a reason for criticism.As with so many Ealing comedies there was an undercurrent of political comment, mainly against the ruling elite. The title itself, a compression of 'kind hearts more than Norman blood', is a little dig at the class system. Many people in the lords claimed superiority for being descended from the 11thC invaders who enslaved the population of England.The series of murders is delightfully naughty even now. Everyone empathises with Dennis Price's put down persona (he plays two parts but this is normally ignored and not credited) despite him becoming a serial killer but Guinness's characters are almost universally pompous and perhaps deserving of their fates.There are little twists all the way through, the main one being the fact that he is put on trial because of a lie from his mistress about a murder he did not commit. How could he argue about it? He is also tried by his peers \u2013 again a nice little point as the only way he earned such distinction was by multiple murders.Some of the scenes are perfectly formed. Price's little shake of the teacup when the shed explodes, killing the husband of the woman sitting opposite him, is deliciously understated.I know I'm going against the flow here but I can't help thinking that the film's weakest bit is the multiple roles taken by Guinness. It was rather pointless and the suspicion is that it was done for reasons of cost. Ealing never spent more than was absolutely necessary and often nowhere near what was required. Perhaps two or three might have been funny.The film is a delight. My son-in-law asked to borrow the DVD and I gave it to him, my wife working out that the reason I did so was to give me a reason to buy the enhanced digitally remastered version.I was very happy that my son-in-law watched the film and enjoyed it. I would have resented it if he'd been too slow to appreciate such a masterpiece.I have ranked this as 10 stars, an almost impossible rating I agree. However, it is my favourite comedy. The script is classic, faultless: the story clever and subtle: the on-liners hilarious: the acting (I haven't mentioned the delicious Valerie Hobson who took her part to perfection \u2013 now I have) spot on: the political comment nicely barbed and easily ignored should the mood take: and it is all so delightfully silly.If this film isn't worth 10 stars then no film is.This is no Hollywood blockbuster. It is, however, the perfect black comedy.",

Another problem with the film is that even when we get to the heart of the picture everything happens so quickly (D'ascoyne's are murdered in quick succession without much planning taking place by Louis; some of the murders are not even shown which robs the film of some of its grit). There are subplots involving Louis' involvement with 2 married women which, whilst pivotal to the story, do not feel entirely necessary.Presumably intended as a black comedy, I have to admit that I did not find much of Kind Hearts and Coronets to be all that funny and nor did I find it to be particularly dramatic either. When watching it, I found myself to be semi-involved in proceedings, but didn't really feel any kind of deep love for the picture. The majority of the characters are shallow and unlikeable (presumably on purpose, but this doesn't always make for a pleasant viewing experience) and personally I found the film to be a little too understated lacking in both pzazz and excitement. I found it to be watchable and moderately enjoyable, but nothing more than that.Still to end on a positive note; I did enjoy seeing Alec Guinness in multiple roles and his multiple turns here were excellent (Kind Hearts and Coronets may well be the first film to showcase an actor playing multiple roles - although I could be wrong there). I did also like the way that the film pokes fun at the 'class system' highlighting some of the ridiculous and narrow-minded attitudes of the upper crust.For me though to truly be able to enjoy a film of this nature it needs to be exciting, funny, dramatic and/or have at the very least 1 or 2 decent characters. Kind Hearts and Coronets is made up of bits and pieces of all of these things, but not enough of any one element for me to see it as anything other than a fairly average offering.",

And the gimmick of multiple roles with Alec Guinness. It should have worked; I think Guinness could have done wonders with his eight parts. But no, his segments are so thinly written that all eight roles are imminently forgettable. I mean, the very funny picture of Guinness in a dress for the one female role he plays is completely squandered. Not only does Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne get a mere one minute on screen, she doesn't even get a single line! If it weren't enough that Alec Guinness is wasted eight times over, the wonderful Valerie Hobson is equally wasted. The sole performer who pulls off their role is Joan Greenwood, and even she's not great. I seriously cannot see how people find this movie worthwhile. 5/10.",

Also, ackstasis (\"It is so difficult to make a neat job of killing people with whom one is not on friendly terms\", ackstasis from Australia, 27 March 2008).***\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" (1949, Robert Hamer) is a masterpiece of black comedy. Set during the nineteenth century (i.e., the 1860s), it is one of the best acted, written and filmed comedies about murder and class relations ever made. This quintessentially British film is an exquisite pleasure, and make sure you watch it on the big screen.A poor but ambitious cousin of a family of royals takes on the project of removing all the obstacles preventing him from becoming the Duke. He is sentenced to hang only after being convicted of a murder he did not commit. While not (for me) laugh-out-loud funny, there is a great deal of dry wit on hand. Each cast member is superb. Joan Greenwood embellishes the vamp Sibella with her much-envied voice, which has been often compared to a cat's purring. Valerie Hobson (Edith), adds beauty, grace and poise. (I've become a real fan of hers, having also seen her as the Countess in \"The Card\", three weeks ago.) Miles Malleson, as the agreeable and respectful hangman, has his own cult following. However, the two male leads are amazing. Alec Guinness\ufeff famously plays the entire royal D'Ascoyne family comprised of eight (!) members. While each is doomed, Guinness portrays them all differently. Even though some of the D'Ascoynes have few lines and limited screen time, this is still an astonishing feat. Guinness (then 35 and largely unknown to the public) finds so many details with each character representing a wide spectrum of ages (i.e., 35-80) and both genders (Lady Agatha is the sole female) that thespians everywhere should be inspired. It has been said of Guinness that every role he has ever played is different than any other, and here he puts on an acting master class.In most movies, this would be enough. However, Dennis Price\ufeff as Louis, the smooth-talking, serial killer with aristocratic ambition is another character not soon forgotten. In his career performance, Price inhabits the role of Louis and is just as interesting as Guinness throughout. Price also portrays Louis's opera-singing father. I assume that Price is actually the tenor singing early. This fragment sounds great to my ears. The title is inspired by a poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson\ufeff. The screenplay is (by Robert Hamer and John Dighton) and is loosely-based on Roy Horniman's novel. The dialogue is very precise. The story has some unusual plot turns. I like how each murder is off-screen and accomplished in a different way. Visually, Hamer's direction is excellent. He uses the entire frame; and it is always interesting to see the background details. It is impossible to appreciate the skill with which \"Coronets\" is made without seeing it in a movie theater.\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" is a crowd-pleasing screen gem with legendary qualities. Once the concept of \"comic serial killing\" can be explained, it is kid-friendly, too.",

The decision to use narration to advance the plot supplies a few laughs, but generally drains the movie of its energy and forward momentum. This is not a failure on my part to understand dry humor; I adore and live by it, offline. For the first hour the tone is rather unfunny (It explains too much plot via narration) and some of Price's victims are rather nice people. Although I can imagine it plays differently in a movie house, for home viewing it's more of a curio. This is more like a slightly funny Romantic novel filmed (Imagine Great Expectations with more humor) rather than a rollicking black comedy. Dennis Price made me mindful of how few young, attractive British actors make it into their films. There seems to be some sort of system to insure that only average looking, doughy, phlegmatic men over 40 ascend.Guinness is funny even without too many lines. I wish the plot had encompassed the daily news' reaction to so many deaths in a single lineage. Surely, the trend would be noticed. This is my 3rd Joan Greenwood movie.

Louis Mazzini (Denis Price) on the other hand sets out to eliminate the members of a family that stand between him and a title with the cold-blooded calculation of Richard, Duke of York - another work from which it borrows. On the whole it stands up reasonably well, much better than another recent giveaway, Brighton Rock, which has aged badly. It is replete with typically 'English' touches such as Miles Malleson's hangman enquiring in all seriousness of the prison governor (Clive Morton) how he (the hangman) should address the titled victim when they meet formally just prior to the execution and then, having been told 'Your Grace', walking away repeating this to himself complete with the pertinent obsequious gestures. Denis Price captures the right note, a blend of impeccable manners and ruthless cunning but most of the parts played by Alec Guiness lack diversity with nothing, for example, coming even close the complete unrecognisable quality he brought to Fagin within a year of shooting this one. On balance a very passable effort but one that may not stand up to repeated viewings.",

Unfortunately for Dennis Price, no one remembers he was in the movie. Alec Guinness is the favored actor in this one, and for good reason: he plays eight different parts! Old, young, male, female, different hair, posture, accents, Alec plays each of the relatives Dennis comes across in his quest for wealth and title.This isn't the type of movie that will have you laughing out loud, but will instead have you smiling at Dennis's cunningness. He also juggles the affections of the proper Valerie Hobson and the equally conniving Joan Greenwood.

As witty as it is cynical, the film still packs a strong punch and has aged like fine wine.Co-written & directed by Robert Hamer, the story concerns a distant poor relative of a Duke who plots to inherit the title by chopping down the entire family tree. And though the brief overview of his early days doesn't garner much interest, things pick up real quick once he puts his ambitious plan into motion. And through his (mis)deeds, Hamer also explores themes of class, repression & retribution.The film is at its most enjoyable & entertaining when it captures our protagonist carrying out his killings and the lighthearted vibe & intended absurdity only makes those scenes riotously fun to watch. Dennis Price plays the lead role with nonchalant charm but the one who impresses most is Alec Guinness, rendering nine different characters including all heirs in line of succession who get removed from the equation.Overall, Kind Hearts & Coronets is a pitch-black comedy about morals, manners & murders that doubles as a biting commentary on class struggles & relationships and makes brilliant use of its twists to deliver an enjoyable ride. Often ranked amongst the best British comedies of the 1940s, this sardonic & subversive genre delight can still surprise the newcomers with its serrated edges and ends with an ambiguous, ironic & fitting finale.",

His Memoirs, his Karma.. right now I am trying to remember which crime film from old Hollywood has the best and twisty climax ever, I had several names in my mind but I don't remember any film hitting the next level with the smallest period possible in the climax. Kind Hearts and Coronets just did it in those last 10 seconds. Wowww... I was kind of satisfied with the film for 105 and half mins and i thought it would end on predictable note as all crime films end but no, i was wrong. It had a brilliant humourous turn around in the climax which totally blown me. My Memoirs.. Holy Karma.. It's a story of a distant poor relative of the Duke of D'Ascoyne plots to inherit the title by murdering the eight other heirs who stand ahead of him in the line of succession. He successfully murders all of them and i was like this guy deserves to be hanged, please god make it happen. It happens but for the crime he did not attend. He gets away from it too and i was happy to see it although i had the first punishment thought still alive and then his own little Mistake which we all missed strikes. Don't ask what and why, just watch this film to know. I haven't seen a great mixture of black comedy from 40s with such variable twists even though the rest of the plot was predictable and decent at best. Dennis Price was very good and appropriate in his role. I loved his accent and attitude. He narrated the whole story with convincing voice expression. Dialogue were Royal and grammatically high. Screenplay is engaging because of comedy, evil stuff told in no sorry mood and crunchy narration. Director Robert Hamer did exceptionally well despite inconvenient storyline. Overall, a Great Humourous Black Comedy that cannot be missed.RATING - 7/10*",

            "content": "Now here is a film that is completely forgotten nowadays without any reason. There are very good films that time does not forgive and that are left behind as others go out and take their place. In this case, I think the time was unfair. The film is not brilliant, but it has merits and justifies a recap in a cycle of classics, at home or even in a theater, why not?The screenplay is based on a novel by Roy Horniman (probably as forgotten as this film) and follows the account that a condemned man makes of his life: born of his mother's (the daughter of a British duke) morganatic marriage, Louis was voted to oblivion for his entire family in a way that, to us, seems shocking, but it was in fact the thought in vogue in the aristocratic classes until fifty or sixty years ago. He even had no chance to bury his mother in the family tomb. To get his revenge, Louis begins to kill his relatives, but he does not do it randomly: he does so in order to obtain for himself the title and the control of the associated assets and estate.Directed and written by Robert Hamer, it is a classic of British cinema where the \"murder\" theme, so dear to British fiction, is naturally present, albeit in an inverted way: the public follows the killer's steps and knows what he does, but wait and see how he gets caught. In fact, the way he exposes his motivations is so captivating that it is difficult not to support him in his attitudes, even if they are despicable. It's not an incredible film, but it has the merit of entertainment.The cast is quite good: Dennis Price is an excellent protagonist, with a posture quite adequate to what is expected of an aristocrat and impeccable work. Valerie Hobson and Joan Greenwood make a magnificent counterpoint to each other, with antagonistic characters that are everything that the other is not, but build an interesting romantic sub-plot around the main character. But it is Alec Guinness that deserves to take the palm of glory in this film: the actor, still far from stardom, is a true chameleon that assumes several characters, men and women, throughout the film, and that appears and disappears with the greatest of naturalness, and the greatest resourcefulness. It is not a task for any actor!Technically, it's a discreet film, which has nothing special. The opening credits are quite well done from a graphical point of view, and the sets and costumes are very good, but they do not surprise us strictly. The soundtrack takes advantage of famous classical music themes.",

A British film, it combines class-consciousness and Victorian societal wit and manners with the peculiarly British taste for murder in a comedic context. The first 15 minutes are frankly boring, setting up the scenario for all that comes later. A distant poor relative of the Duke of D'Ascoyne plots to inherit the title by murdering the eight other heirs who stand ahead of him in the line of succession. The British flare for satire and irony is never better displayed. Alec Guiness plays the part of eight members of an aristocratic family, each one a different character, and pulls it off. The protagonist, Dennis Price, by turns charming, calculating, ironic, plays the poor relation, determined to get to the top. Valerie Hobson plays the good woman, Joan Greenwood, in her best film performance, plays the bad. She steals every scene with nothing more than her sultry voice. Dialogue, acting, even set design are all superb. This is the kind of film that Hitchcock tried to make all his life, and only succeeded a few times.",

The photography is excellent and some of the actors (Greenwood, Guinness, Price - in that order) are good, but there are two major problems. First, this is supposed to be a comedy but I smiled only once: when Louis, after several murders, reluctantly has to go hunting and tells the viewer that he disapproves of bloodsports because of his principles. Second, the story is just not interesting. This is mainly because there is not a single character whose fate I could care about. The victims are only caricatures, and Louis is such a bore that I soon kept hoping that they would hang him and get the film over with.This is not the first time a supposed Ealing classic has left me stone cold. I also found \"Whisky Galore\", \"The Lavender Hill Mob\" and \"The Ladykillers\" almost totally unfunny. I know that this could cause me to be refused to ever enter Britain again, but such is life.",

Actually I couldn't stick it any more and gave up a few pages in to the third book, but the first two didn't endear me to him.I'm not sure you could make this film with the same effect nowadays.

Now I think of comedy as telling jokes, pulling a face etc..however this film is not an example of that at all.My first foray into the films that were shot post war at the old Ealing Studios in London, U.K. that became known as Ealing comedies. It is more a black comedy. Showing humour such as the screenplay itself.The screenplay is about a rich, aristocratic family called D'Ascoyne's. The family has a noble title producing the Lord Chalfont. The family have a black sheep as such caused by one of the members having a relationship and producing a son with an Italian. The said black sheep of the family, a female branch and the son Louis Mazzini (Vincent Price) live in relative London suburbia poverty well away from the trappings of aristocracy.In later life Louis becomes bitter and vows revenge on the family who have disowned him and stand in the way of the dukedom. All eight members! Hence a series of murders occurs as Louis becomes ever closer to being ancestor to the Lord Chalfont title. I didn't realise until watching the film that all those eight members of both genders are brilliantly portrayed by Alec Guiness. A far cry from some of his roles in later life!The film is a delight and the old black and white photography a triumph that adds to the class of the film. On further reading the Director of Photography is Douglas Slocombe who I recognise from Carry On films to Indiana Jones blockbusters. Surprisingly good first foray into the Ealing comedy.",

He goes as far as to swear that he will be the next head of the family, a new Duke of Chalfont.It's a surprisingly dark tale for a mid-century British film. Of course, the Hays Code was purely a Hollywood thing, so the films made elsewhere could be darker, but this was still a bit out of the norm. But it's stronger for it. Louis's vendetta is easy to understand and he's charismatic enough to pull us to his side of things. It also helps how the rest of the D'Ascoynes (almost all played by the unrivaled Alec Guinness) are such despicable and uptight people.Speaking of uptight, apparently this film was meant to be a satire against Edwardian London sensibilities and the rigidness of the upper class mannerisms. And it might have been, during its time, but I'm afraid that its satire is way too subtle for someone like me who's seeing it seventy years later. Because I didn't get that this was a satire, like at all. I thought its Edwardian London aesthetic, speech patterns, mannerisms and customs were easily the best part of it. All the characters had a delightfully stiff upper lips and they all talked so well and precisely. I absolutely loved it.Goes to show how time works its blurring wonders on subtleties.If I had to nitpick, I'd call the ending too neat. The plot falls in on itself a bit easily. A necessity of the time period, I suppose, but it's nevertheless a shame, given how clever the rest of the film had been up to that point.A good film, nonetheless. Borderline great. I liked the characters, I liked the setting (satire or not) and I liked the plot. Easily recommended.",

I guess a few of the characters were funny, like the General but are hardly given enough screen time to do anything.  There are lots of scenes with the main character courting one of the two ladies with absolutely nothing humorous going on.  This isn't an awful film, and I kind of liked the story, but it could have been a lot better.  They should have just done away with the pointless and unfunny romance scenes and lengethend the murders and given Guiness more screen time.

That is not to say that it's in any way a bad film, merely that it's a definite product of its time, with a slow pace and theatrical direction, dialogue and performances that may not be to everybody's tastes.However, if you give \"Kind Hearts\" a fair chance you'll uncover an absolutely superb story that has its decent share of plot twists and ironies. The script, though wordy, is magnificent and delivered impeccably by the actors, particularly by star and narrator Dennis Price who one suspects was born to read such lines. Price gives the standout performance of his career and it's a shame in a way that it's so often overshadowed by Alec Guinness' turn as the entire D'Ascoyne family, though of course Guinness is note-perfect and his achievement is startling. Joan Greenwood is also particularly noteworthy, proving that strong female characters on film were not an invention of later decades, and Greenwood was one of the best actresses we ever had.I must admit that \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" is a film I admire more than I actively enjoy, though it has a great deal of merit and is well worth watching at least once. I fear, though, that it's a cinematic entry destined to always adorn \"100 Best Movies\" lists with fewer and fewer people having actually watched it. Perhaps it'd be worth updating for a modern audience - the only film that I think would benefit from a remake - so long as the essential charm and genteel elegance were retained.",

It leaves me confused. I found the movie a bit slow and boring. Perhaps I need to know more about England, literature and class systems to properly appreciate it. Some humour may have gone over my head. But good comedy should transcend barriers, it should speak to every keen audience member. And it should fire on all cylinders if possible. This Is Spinal Tap has funny dialogue, sight gags, a mockumentary style, funny gestures and facial expressions, everything. But this movie seems to depend almost solely on words with only a handful of visual gags.Alec Guinness doesn't get to do a whole lot. Mostly he wears various costumes and sits and talks like an old man or says nothing at all. It's an acting job that many would be capable of. Why not make better use of him? Dennis Price is too plain and calm for my liking. I found this to make him forgettable and uninteresting. He doesn't seem to feel anything. I get that there is subtlety but then it should be witty or ironic the whole way through. The problem is that half of the lines aren't funny at all and we're left with too many dull moments. There is no drama or romance to speak of so why not go all the way with the comedy? It's confusing. I spent scenes trying to find the humour and couldn't. What are those scenes there for?A handful of parts were hilarious. Price puts gasoline in a photographer's camera. Eventually the photographer goes off to develop the film. We hear an off-screen \"boom\" and then smoke slowly rises in the distance. The characters barely notice but eventually Price goes to investigate. \"Needless to say, it was too late.\" One character he wishes to execute is in jail. So he helps petition for her release. He expresses his gladness when another one of his targets dies. He somewhat liked them and is now relieved from the duty of murdering them. A captain of a ship confuses the sea terms for left and right and gives instructions that lead to an easily avoidable crash with another ship. Both sink and everyone comfortably survives except for the captain - he stubbornly chooses to go down with his ship. The image of him saluting as he goes down is hysterical.I can see what Kind Hearts and Coronets is trying to do. But that's the problem - I should love this movie. I love sarcasm and irony and subtle wit and juxtaposition. The idea of a gentleman planning the vaguely justified murder of a series of rich relatives (played by one actor) and then running into numerous little difficulties is appealing. But this movie feels a bit too slow and pretentious for my liking. It presumes our attention rather than working for it. Not all of the jokes are great and I think most could be done more effectively. Too many scenes are unnecessary and waste time. They don't build tension or develop important plot points.I definitely need to give this another viewing at some later date, perhaps after becoming more familiar with Ealing movies and British humour in general. But I also have to trust my current judgement and say that aside from an overall mildly amusing undercurrent and some laugh out loud moments, Kind Hearts and Coronets is quite plain and underwhelming.",
