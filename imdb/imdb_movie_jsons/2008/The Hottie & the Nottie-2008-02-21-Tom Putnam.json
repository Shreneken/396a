            "content": "OK, I'm not going to bash this film based on Paris Hilton, I admit, I don't like the girl, but I'm not going to base my comment on that alone, I think it's unfair. A lot of people are giving this movie a one just because of Paris without even seeing the movie, it gets a bit annoying. But I don't know why, I think I was just in a mood for one of those awful films that just leave a bad taste in your mouth, I think every once in a while, we need to see something like that. Now the problem with The Hottie and the Nottie, besides it's stupid title? The story, beyond predictable and hypocritical, along with the acting... it's like they just took people off the street who had no credibility to be in a film. I love how Paris Hilton isn't even the main character and yet she is first billed, you know that she paid good money for that or wouldn't be in it, big woop, her as an innocent charity loving girl, that's believable.Nate Cooper is a man that just can't seem to move on in life, after 20 years he returns to his home town looking for his first grade crush, Cristabel. She's still around making men drool, but she won't go for him unless he can hook her ugly friend, June, up with a guy as well. June has bad teeth, bad skin, bad nails, bad hair, just all in all, it's bad, so Nate does everything he can to get June a guy, but it's more difficult than he could ever expect, until he finds out that love isn't everything he thought it might be.The script is predictable, stupid, could've been written by a teenager and was very hypocritical, which you will see what I mean if you watch this movie. Now I know that they were just trying to get a big name, but come on... Paris Hilton? I actually had an open mind and just thought to give the movie a shot, but she just is such a horrible actress, like beyond horrible, I'm not just saying that because of who she is, just I know you'll believe me. This is a movie that really shouldn't have been made or if Hollywood wanted it so much, get different people, please, before they do something like cast Paris... never mind. Stay away from this movie at any costs.1/10",

            "content": "It's obvious a movie that's sole claim to fame is that it stars Paris Hilton is not going to be a masterpiece. In fact, it seems every movie Paris Hilton stars in ends up being a horrible mess, and this is no exception. The Hottie and the Nottie...let's just think about what a stupid and conceited title that is. When Paris Hilton was offered the role as \"The Hottie\" she should have turned it down, not just because the script felt like it was written by a 10 year old, but because she is playing \"The Hottie\". That sounds so conceited, especially since Paris Hilton isn't all she seems to think she is. The title is also stupid, and sounds about as mature as the actual script is, which is the maturity you might find in an elementary school bathroom.Nate Cooper (Joel Moore, who seems to be a mixture of John Heder and Mike White) is dumped by his girlfriend and decides to go to Los Angeles to find and date Christabelle Abbot (Paris Hilton), the girl he was attracted to in the first grade. Christabelle is apparently so attractive that every time she goes jogging, all males stop their activities to stare at her mouth agape. He ends up becoming friends again with her, but she can't go out with him because she made a pact with her not so attractive best friend June Phigg (Christina Lakin). Nate tries to set up guys with June to get with Christabelle. As June begins to get procedures done to her to make her less ugly, Nate begins to become more attracted to her.I believe earlier I said that June Phigg was not so attractive. Well that's an understatement. The make-up people made the normally attractive Christina Lakin as nasty looking as possible, with black and green teeth stubs, a balding head, and a terrible case of halitosis. Several times I had to turn away from the screen when they would base the humor around June's hideousness, because I felt like I was going to throw up.The script is bad, unfunny, and along with that shows no development in character whatsoever. Nate begins to fall for June, but not until after she becomes pretty. Before that, he shows no interest in her at all. He didn't even like her personality, he cares simply about looks, so if any of the female characters were like him, they would be running for the hills from this doofy looking guy. In a romantic comedy (I guess you can call this that, despite the lack of romance or humor), you'd expect there to be someone looking for their true love, but not here. It's all about looks in this superficial waste of time. Also Nate is always lying to make himself seem hipper, and ends up seeming like an unfunny version of Seinfeld's George Costanza, mixed with a lobotomized Napolean Dynamite. The plot also makes little sense. This guy had a crush on this girl in the first grade, then moved. Who the heck keeps a crush on a girl he only knew for less than a year, that barely even knew him. He thinks back to his time in elementary school and really wants to see her...she was a little girl. It's almost pedophilic.The acting is all around bad. Joel Moore is by far the best actor, and he doesn't even deserve to play extras in community theater. Paris Hilton has an annoying flirtatious delivery of each line, and I don't think that she was told to act this way, this is just her natural acting abilities. Christina Lakin also has very poor acting abilities, but also didn't really need any. Her role is to be there and look as nasty as possible, then later to look pretty. She has few lines in comparison to the two untalented leads, especially Joel who spouts out stupid lines every 2 seconds. The back-up cast is also terrible, including one guy, who plays Nate's stupid friend, who thinks he is so cool, he's credited as The Greg Wilson, after all it's super cool to put a \"The\" in front of your name.I watched this movie, because I thought it might be one of those \"So bad it's funny\" experiences that you enjoy laughing about later with friends. This is not one of those movies. It's just bad, no wait, it's just terrible. The movie's sense of the humor is so bad, it actually almost made me feel sorry for the writer. If she thought what she was writing was good at all, then she is either completely delusional, or she might have a mental problem. I hope Heidi Ferrer, writer of this film, along with a few episodes of Dawson's Creek, will write a masterpiece and just leave this as a blemish on her booming career, but in the future not force contrived slop on the viewing public with any more screenplays like this.Now, onto the positives. The camera direction wasn't bad. It was kind of flashy and nice looking at times. The beach this was shot at looked like it would be nice to go for a dip at. I guess that counts as a positive. Paris Hilton plays a terrible character, but at least she's a kind hearted one. And that's all I can think of.If you can't tell, I hated this movie with a passion, and from it's current ranking of number 10 in the bottom 100, I can tell other people share my views on this cinematic massacre.My rating: BOMB out of ****. 88 mins. PG-13 for language, and crude humor.",

            "content": "First off, the whole movie might just hit a Razzies grand slam for 2008. This film easily achieves Worst \"Actress\" for Paris Hilton, but the horrible support of the main actor Joel Moore on her side, the no-brainer screenplay, the childish script (if you look in the quotes section, see if it feels like the way ACTUAL human beings would normally talk), and the horribly wrong direction is not helping her out. It's horrible to see that this movie was accepted to be taken on to be a movie.The Premise is simple: A guy (Moore) chases the girl of his dreams from kindergarten (Hilton), and finds her just as stunning, and single, as he could have ever dreamed. Well, not entirely single, as she still has the same friend from kindergarten (Larkin), who is hideously ugly. Hideously. Disgustingly. Hell-Hole. Frigging. Ugly! Jesus! All the money it must have took to make 100% sure that Larkin was going to be the most vomit inducing creature must have been half the cost of the movie. The other half must have been Hilton's salary, as, there is nothing else that possibly could have cost money, as the movie really has nothing to offer. Don't get me wrong, though, Paris Hilton's \"Acting\" doesn't even deserve the time and energy it takes to pull out a check. Before I get off on a tangent (or is it too late), it sickens me to see that hideous creature co-starring this mess.Well anyway, as it turns out, Moore has to find a guy to go out with Larkin, because Hilton swore that she wouldn't ever date again until her friend has a date too. And, oh-so surprisingly, Moore starts to develop feelings for Larkin despite the ugliness(!!!!!) of her skin. Don't blame me for the horrible predictable screenplay, as anyone with eyes could see that something like this would happen. Of course, normally a moral is at least enough from saving a movie to be a 2 instead of a 1, but the true showing of Moore's character's true liking for the \"Nottie\" is after her surgery and transformation. It implies to all young girls that they NEED to be that perfect ten in order to be looked gracefully upon society. That is a horrible thing to engrave into a girls mind.AND THEY HAD TO MAKE HER SO FREAKING UGLY! It's torture staring at the screen with that freakish wreak up there. And half the movie is gross out gags making fun of her. It isn't even like Norbit's make-up department, which made a black man believably Asian. Instead, it enhances unbelievability, as no one would ever be that ugly. Normally, I look for ANYTHING to give in order to prevent a 1 star vote. This includes Acting, Special Effects, Costumes, Dialog, even one fresh joke. But this movie deserves what I give it, the worst possible grade ever. I wish there was a Zero out of Ten, as this movie gives me and my eyes nothing but pain.",

If Judge (Michael) Sauer had the power to indict her for bad acting, singing, and just plain performing overall, he'd lock the door, throw the key away, and make sure this nottie \u0096 with an Executive Producer credit, of all things! \u0096 never got out.

            "review_title": "This Is So Not Hot",
            "content": "The Hottie and the Nottie is somewhat of a conundrum; it is a romantic comedy that is neither moving nor funny. It attempts moments of gross-out humor, but holds back from going for an R rating. And for having a target audience of teenage girls, it lacks characters that most girls that age will be able to identify with.The last two films that Paris Hilton has appeared in have received some of the lowest ratings in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). Pledge This! received a user rating of 1.6, ranking it at #7 in IMDb's Bottom 100, while Bottoms Up was rated 1.9 and rang in at #22 in the Bottom 100. It appears as though Hilton is lined up for a hat trick with The Hottie and the Nottie, having managed to hammer out three terrible films in a row.This is not to say all the blame should be placed on Hilton. She does a decent job with what she had to work with. But scriptwriter Heidi Ferrer manages to cram more teen movie clich\u00e9s and unfunny moments into ninety minutes than any reasonable person could.The film begins with Nate Cooper (Joel David Moore) remembering first grade and his first experience of love, with Cristabelle Abbott (Hilton). Then the film flashes forward twenty years to an older, sadder version of Nate, accompanied by unnecessary character narration \u0096 a sure red flag for a bad movie.After his girlfriend leaves him, Nate decides to move from Maine to California to find his first-grade crush. Somehow he is in touch with Arno Blout (The Greg Wilson), from first grade, a disgusting mess who lives with his mom. In less than 20 seconds, Arno quickly fills Nate in on all that he's missed in the past twenty years; Cristabelle is hot and single, but that is only because she lives with her ugly friend, June Phigg (Christine Lakin), also from first grade! OMG! So begins Nate's quest to conquer Cristabelle, aided by Arno's stalker file, which tracks her every move. After their lives literally collide, it doesn't take long for Nate to find out what a nice girl Cristabelle is and how she creepily remembers him, too. Of course they cannot be together because that would be a fifteen-minute movie, so she confides that she will not go out with anyone until June gets a boyfriend. Nate vows to find June someone so he can cozy up to Cristabelle.From here, the film devolves into a banal take on \"The Taming of the Shrew\" as Nate tries to find someone who will go out with the ugly duckling of a friend, only to find himself suddenly in love with her the instant she gets a makeover. Try not to count the number of loose ends or the implausible leaps of believability -- there are simply too many.Probably the saddest piece in this Jenga game of absurdity is the director, Tom Putnam. Just five years ago he was named \"One of the 25 New Faces of Independent Film\" by Filmmaker Magazine. But \"fresh\" isn't a word that comes to mind when describing this film.",

There's a reason the rest of the cast is made up of unknowns and little known bit players in Hollywood.There have been some pretty dense actors through the years, but Hilton is by far the runaway winner of all time. She even believes her award from Harvard is something good!Some people learn they don't have the skills to be in the business after the first flop, or at least after the second bomb.

As for the writer, well it wouldn't surprise me if it was written by a child because that is the sort of stuff a 6 year old would scribble down if told to write a story. From a technical viewpoint, this film wasn't the worst if you exclude every other film made in history. As for comedy - Well this film makes Schindler's list look like Monty Python, I found this film about as funny as AIDS. Now romance is the only convincing factor in this film, that is if your idea of romance is watching a drunken 1 night stand where both parties have very unsatisfactory sex.I can't rate this because it is like lining your Grandmothers up and rating their looks.

            "content": "Uhmmm.... well, I wanted to make a witty remark, but I can't think of anything. Blah.Yes, I saw the movie. I have certain masochist tendencies I'm not too proud of. I love watching bad cinema. To be quite honest, I did enjoy this movie in a certain level - it's like watching Jerry Springer, or reading the National Enquirer. I'm not ashamed to admit I watch and read both. So take this review as you will.First, the bad things. The main problem I could find is that there must be some sort of connection between a movie and reality, however feeble it may be. As long as we can sort of identify with the main characters or the situations they are in, we'll play along with the plot, however idiotic it may be. But there's nobody to identify yourself with. Unless you are extremely weird. If you are, I apologize for insulting you.The movie is basically a copy of \"Ugly Betty\" and the Latin American originals. Except that in those series, the ugly chick is kinda nice. Here, she is obnoxious, dumb, and a bit annoying. Is it a surprise that Paris' Hilton character is desired by 99.9999999% of the people in this movie, and is the nicest, most beautiful person inside and out of them all? I hope not, because if you were surprised, then once again, I apologize for insulting you.The movie had an interesting hint which I'll share with you; the main characters spend the entire movie drinking alcohol. It's not that I'm disgusted by it, but hey, there are other things in life. Maybe water, Coke, whatever? Every time a character is facing a difficult task (going out with the ugly chick, trying to have sex), he gets drunk. Way to go! Maybe that should be a pre-requisite for watching the movie, actually. I suggest a DVD tie-in: 2 liters of Bacardi Blanco when you buy the Special Edition.The movie itself isn't that bad. I mean, it was entertaining. That's more that I can say of... uhm... \"The Phantom Menace\", for example. I go to movies to be entertained, and I don't care about anything else. Think about a carwreck on the other side of the highway. Do you stop and stare, and then feel all guilty inside, yet strangely satisfied? I rest my case.Don't expect any morality lessons here, though. The movie was far too busy making Paris look like the hottest woman on earth to care about any sort of message whatsoever. Which, I suppose, is a good thing, since most of the people who will watch this thing are too dumb to know what a morality lesson is, anyway (I include myself in this select, elite group). I think it had something to do with \"if you are ugly, then you need to find a guy willing to have sex with you in exchange for dntal work. Then you get all pretty and everyone wants to have sex with you, so you can dump the dentist\". Or something.My spoiler: Want to know the best laugh of the whole movie? Paris Hilton is supposed to work for a charity organization. There, I said it. Since you weren't going to watch this movie anyway, I really don't feel guilty at all.Enjoy!",

            "content": "First of all, I must provide a little background information for you to get the full scope of this review. I am a b-movie fan, when I have some free time (usually during summers) I will try and watch the worst movies (aside from art-house films) that I can find. I mean it. I've seen almost every Seltzer & Friedberg spoof, The Room, and lots of cult movies. I am oddly curious, for some reason, just how bad bad movies are. I bought a copy of this thing at a flea market for $1.50. I don't like to spend much on bad movies (I'm a broke college student anyway) but when I saw this at the store, I thought I had really outdone myself. Everything about this movie, aesthetically speaking, called out to me that it was especially awful. I mean, it stars a celebrity without an acting background (unless you count reality TV), it has the words \"hottie\" and \"nottie\" in the title, and it is squarely in the bottom 100 on this website. So I popped this thing in, and I watched it for a while. The first 20 minutes are pretty horrible. The next twenty minutes are even worse. (I mean, she dates a guy that physically ran out on her twice, the sight gags are lame, the humor is pretty awful, etc. At about 0:45 minutes I thought that it had beaten the record for worst movie I had ever seen. Then, in the next twenty minutes something strange happened. The movie got strangely charming and a little bit deep. I was no longer watching the clock closely (as is my custom when I watch something truly awful)and I started paying attention because I wanted to, as strange as that sounds. I could actually kind of relate to the main character a bit and, as June transformed, the acting from whoever played her got a lot better. I really starting to be amazed by what I was seeing, and how \"not awful\" it was. Sure, the first 40 minutes of it suck (which disqualifies about 90% of people) but the ending is good, the music is kind of catchy, and, overall I really did not hate this movie. Granted, maybe my tastes are a bit tainted from watching turkeys like Meet the Spartans and The Garbage Pail Kids Movie, but I thought that the last 20 minutes made up for the first 40 minutes. I actually believe this movie gets kind of deep at moments. Granted, there are numerous problems, such as the fact that June dates a guy that physically runs out on her two times in a row. The whole Johan thing is kind of sketchy too, but overall, I didn't think it was horrible. Maybe it still deserves to be in the bottom 100 but, it's not on the level of like Date Movie , which actually has a better rating than this thing. If you're tough or bored enough, you may want to watch this thing. It gets better after a while, and the music is alright. I can't say that for stuff like Epic Movie, that type of thing is only for people who like to endure bad movies like I do. I give it a 5/10 for that reason. This is my first review on IMDb, but I figured I would start writing some because I've seen a lot of movies that, for obvious reasons, other people don't watch all the way through.",

            "content": "\"The Hottie and the Nottie\" is one of those hypocritical films that pretends to make the case that beauty is only skin deep - only to turn right around and prove the opposite.Cribbing at least a portion of its story from \"The Taming of the Shrew,\" the movie stars Paris Hilton as Cristobel, a drop-dead gorgeous \"hottie\" who has put her own love life on hold until her grotesquely unattractive best friend, June (\"the nottie\"), can get some guy to go out with her. This is bad news for Nate Cooper, a first class dweeb who's had a major crush on Cristobel ever since the day she sauntered into his class in the first grade and ignited his passion. When he finally finds her again after all these years, he's stuck with having to come up with a guy who'll be willing to date the nottie - that is, if Nate is to have any chance at all of making it with the hottie.I suspect that \"The Hottie and the Nottie\" was originally designed as some sort of bizarre vanity project for Ms. Hilton, showcasing just how much better looking she is than the rest of the human race by placing her side by side with the most unattractive woman the filmmakers could possibly come up with. But I believe there's something more insidious at work here, in that, in the end, the movie endorses the very thing it is supposedly arguing against. Through all sorts of unlikely cosmetic alterations, the \"nottie\" is miraculously transformed into a \"hottie,\" making her at last an acceptable object for love - thereby assuring that all is indeed right with the universe. The movie also labors under the double standard of requiring that the women all be beautiful and sexy while the men are allowed to look as dowdy and disheveled as they please and not be judged for it.Still, there's probably no point in over-thinking a movie that's as featherweight and insignificant as this one is. And bad as it is, there are a few genuinely funny moments when Nate finds himself competing with an impossibly handsome, blonde, granite-jawed, muscle-bound \"doctors without borders\" dentist for Cristobel's affections. Nate gets a bit of his own back in these scenes and they are well-played and clever, at least compared to the rest of the movie. Hilton doesn't exactly disgrace herself in the role of the hottie - she actually has a certain innate sweetness that is rather disarming at times - but her acting has yet to go much beyond simple posturing and posing. Joel Moore, Christine Lakin and Johann Urb can't be blamed for the material they've been handed, so we can be generous in our assessment of their performances and simply note that all three have their moments of likability and charm. Here's hoping they have better luck in their future projects.",

            "content": "Let's be honest: rom-coms frequently celebrate really questionable values and champion behavior that would land you a restraining order in real life. If this movie had had a little bit more self-awareness, it could have been a pretty good parody of the genre, but it takes itself way too seriously for that.It starts out by stretching the \"lovable loser\" trope way past the breaking point. Our \"hero\", Nate, had a crush on a girl named Cristabel in the first grade, then his family moved across the country and he never saw her again. Now an \"adult\" (in years anyway), he's never gotten over this. He can't stay in a relationship, or even hold a job, because he can't get Cristabel off his mind. Rather than see a therapist, he decides he has seek her out. Since Google doesn't exist in this universe, he hops in his car (which definitely couldn't have made the trip) and drives across the country to find his first grade friend, Arno. It turns out Arno has also been obsessed with Cristabel since the first grade (what are the odds?). In fact, he's been stalking her his entire life, and has compiled a full dossier with the help of his mother, with whom he lives and has a very creepy relationship. Like Nate, he appears not to have a job. In spite of his lifelong obsession, he seems to have no personal interest in Cristabel, and has apparently just been waiting around for Nate to return so he can help him win her over.He re-introduces himself to Cristabel, the eponymous \"hottie\", by tackling her while she's jogging. Rather than macing him like any sane person, she somehow charmed by him and says the only reason she won't date him is not that he's unattractive, broke, and generally has nothing going for him, but rather that she has to find someone for her \"nottie\" friend, June, who has also been around since the first grade, and the stakes are set.In their quest to solve this problem, Nate and Arno will establish themselves to be truly loathsome individuals, but we're meant to ignore that because of the inherent nobility of first grade crushes.If you've ever seen a rom-com, it won't be a spoiler to tell you that Nate encounters a rival who is everything he isn't: good looking, wealthy, athletic, charming, and talented. The thing is, this guy is also at least a good a person as Nate, probably better.Anyway, yada, yada, you see the end coming a mile away, and we learn some valuable lessons about how important it is for women to be as attractive as possible if they ever want to be happy, and how important it is for men to, um...., have a pulse, I guess.",

It is a story of surpassing the physical stuff and loving someone for their inner personality. And it is not original, nor genius, but it is a warm and funny film. I'm certain that if some actress who is not famous for being famous is playing Hilton's role, that this movie would have like 5.0 average rating instead of 1.9.

I guess it's the hope that amidst the rubble of bad buzz, something halfway decent may emerge. I didn't take ANY hope of that happening with The Hottie and the Nottie. Didn't even plan on seeing it in theaters until a perfect storm of events came to pass. 1) The movie had a historically low turnout on opening weekend. 2) It reached the \"top\" on IMDb's bottom 100. 3) I had a friend who wanted to see the movie because she thought the trailer looked GOOD(!). How could I pass up the opportunity to be amongst the select few to say I saw this in theaters (I think more people have won lotteries). As a bonus I figured on getting some laughs out of every abysmal joke that would make my easily amused friend laugh. With this in mind, no one was more shocked than I to find myself laughing at what was on screen. What most of the negative reviews fail to grasp is that the star of the movie is not Paris Hilton but the male lead, Joel Moore. The Nate character is that rarity in films, a dorky underdog who is nonetheless confident in his conviction of what he wants. Too often we are subjected to the put upon dweeb who blossoms (think Jason Biggs), or the part gets cast with a good looking guy like Dane Cook/Ryan Reynolds since confidence is only a trait of the pretty (I'd try to make a distinction between these two, but there is none when we're talking about this level of unfunny). Joel Moore looks and acts the part perfectly and is even able to wring new layers of laughs out of a sitcom level scene that has him trying to make up a name for a fictional friend who might be interested in dating the Nottie (the \"Cole Slawsen\" scene was where I finally gave in to the slapdash charms of this movie).Paris Hilton isn't even the main female character. Christine Lakin as the Nottie really works in one of the most thankless roles I've ever seen. She has a good chemistry with Joel Moore and tackles the part fearlessly, somehow making you care about the Nottie's fate. Lakin's almost too good as the dignity and awareness she brings only makes me wish the filmmakers had gone for something a little less ridiculous in conceiving the hideous physical flaws of one June Phigg (that infected toenail bit belongs in American Pie) and put more effort into the strange relationship she has with Hilton's Hottie character. The premise of the movie is that every beautiful girl has a less than beautiful friend, so why not explore the darker aspects of that? As for the notorious Paris Hilton, the truth is she didn't bug me here. The part is made with her limitations in mind and is akin to Bo Derek's in 10. Her main contribution is that her name was enough to get a movie made which stars unknown talents like Moore and Lakin as romantic leads. So there it is, a good review of the worst movie of all time. I'd be shocked to see of anyone who finds this review \"useful\" based on the comments I've read so far. Let's see how that theory holds up.",

I think she's matured from a tabloid It Girl heiress to a mature young woman who knows the value of her name, and is focused on building her brand. She is every bit the businesswoman that Kim Kardashian-West only wishes she could be. This movie is an artifact of that transitioning period.I therefore consider myself to be more unprejudiced and open-minded than others here. (Hindsight may also be a factor; I am reviewing this in 2018.)What we have here is a lighthearted, brainless adolescent romp. Joel David Moore is terrific as the lead. And Paris' acting isn't terrible, it's just fine in fact (a significant improvement over her Bottoms Up performance). An enjoyably trashy B-movie. It was after all shot in 5 weeks with a $9million budget and produced by Paris Hilton Entertainment.At worst it's corny and very average; at best it has a little heart and charm.

Unfortunately, the sheer volume of votes by people who haven't bothered to see it means this review will probably get lost and ignored, but I think this film deserves better than it's getting so I'll try anyway.I won't go over the plot because that can be seen above, except to say that its the usual love story sort of thing. I don't think the filmmakers were going for anything mindblowingly original here, nor is that what we end up with. What we do get is a sweet and lighthearted film that takes an everyday setting and throws in some fairly normal, although exaggerated, characters and builds a simple little interwoven romance around them. From the outset it's not difficult to predict what will happen in the end, the acting of Paris Hilton isn't what I'd call good but it's by no means teeth grindingly bad either, and the characters (especially June and Johann) have been taken to the extreme in terms of looks and talent respectively but that is no bad thing. The aforementioned things do prevent you from getting fully immersed in things and you're constantly reminded that you're watching a film, but I think thats okay for something that only wants to entertain you for a while. The other actors were good, it was shot well, and the script and narrative, however simple, were well matched with the cinematography and general feel of the film. The film made me laugh several times (which is more than I can say for most recent comedies), the interactions between characters was handled well and the ancillary characters neither infringed upon the main ones or felt pointlessly lost in the background, and the direction, whilst not world class, was better than I've seen in a lot of films and no shots felt out of place or jarred you from the flow of the film.Overall, I found this film entertaining despite not being immersive or 'deep' and, since I believe that was the intention, I can't say the filmmakers failed here. I don't feel that I've wasted my time, I had no trouble watching this all the way through, and although I probably wouldn't watch it again for several years I thought it managed to lift itself above the usual standard of Hollywood films these days, if only a little. If you cant stand Paris Hilton, if you want to tax your brain, or if you want a film to get lost in then this is one to avoid, however if you've got some time to fill and you want to see something that wont weigh you down then you can't really go wrong with this one.

Johann Urb is sensational as the \"Perfect\" male who you just can't hate.This movie won a few awards (razzies, heh).

Personally I believe that if I were to be able to remake this film some 40 years for now on an epic movie scale in the vein of Michael Bay or Steven Spielberg, for everyone to see, this is how I would do it. Without a doubt, Paris Hilton would be, and should have played, the role of Nottie if this movie was going to garner any sort of attention in the mass media. That's the kind of roles she should be getting since she thinks everyone should take her seriously as both actress and a Hilton. But obviously, Paris doesn't seem to actually want to get good roles and just continue to play the part of the silly dumb bimbo who somehow plays a major role in movies as lame as this. Did National Lampoon make this movie? It almost feels like it, or all those lame American Pie continuations. Paris instead yucks it up with a bunch of other actors who really did this for a quick couple of dollars to pay the rent, perhaps. I certainly didn't find this movie any funny, nor interesting, and it was my younger sister who rented it to see how messed up it really is.After sitting through halfway, it got so much waves of quiet awkwardness and scorn from everyone that we ultimately returned it pretending it was scratched and unplayable on our DVD - replacing it with a movie, actually, no, instead we got a DVD containing a collection of 20 random infamous fight scenes from movies over the years: Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Brad Pitt, Rowdy Roddy Piper (\"PUT ON THE GLASSES!\"). It definitely soothed the soul and made us forget we ever watched a film like this ever. It's not as eyebleedingly bad as Uwe Boll, but it certainly ranks among next to it.Unless you like cruelty to people who aren't as distinguished as you are, or stress the fact that \"Girls, if you want to look good for your Boy, surgery is the best way to go,\" which is terrible to even consider even as a moral, then go ahead and see this movie.But if you're smart, go see Star Wars or something again.",

I think that it will help you.Firstly, lets talk about the low 1.1 (or whatever it is now) score that this movie has been given by IMDb users. It doesn't deserve it. Yep, you heard me right. It doesn't deserve it. Why? Because the truth is - this film isn't \"awful, horrendous, a crime...\" or other words LAZY, IDIOTIC certain IMDb users throw about. Screaming and shouting even more? Hang on, I'll explain.Why does it deserve 5? Because there are other films out there, that have been worse then this. Meet the Spartans for example, another film I have seen recently. That deserves to have a lower score. Why? Because it has poor acting from nearly everyone, a terrible story and a horrible attempt at a spoof. And believe me, I love my spoofs from classics such as Airplane to Hotshots right up to the Scary movie series. There are films out there that have been made with NO CARE \u0096 just for fame or money. But \"The hottie and the nottie\" was not one of them.I'm going to be honest. This film wasn't the best film in the world. The acting wasn't amazing, the cinematography didn't blow me away and the cast wasn't all A list. But so what? Does every single film have to have these attributes to be \"watchable\"? No. This movie WAS made with some care, although not a lot. The script although cheesy at most points, wasn't as bad as (do I have to mention meet the Spartans again? How about Datemovie \u0096 yuck) others, and the acting (minus Paris Hilton) was actually decent.So what went wrong? Well obviously you are all shouting out \"Paris Hilton\" by now and I do have to admit \u0096 She was pretty bad. And Paris, I hope you read this, because I am not going to be immature and throw stupid words around, but rather give some advice. You need to seriously consider acting as an ART not a \"job\" or a quick route to glamour and honour. Some people are born with the talent and some need to develop it through teaching and discipline. You have some evidence of ability (towards the end of the movie you don't have to wince as much watching Paris and during the \"pretend drunken\" scene she was actually OK) but you unfortunately HAVE to work on your abilities. You need to take time out from the crazy lifestyle you lead and spend a few years asking yourself do you want to become a SERIOUS DEDICATED actress or a laughing stock. If you put your mind to it, I'm sure you will impress most of us \u0096 but make it a comeback \u0096 wait a few years, don't just keep making half-assed attempts in many movies otherwise there will be a day when not even ANY director will hire you.After her performance in HOUSE OF WAX, I'm not surprised many people didn't want to see this movie, but they should have still given the movie a rating based on the other actors abilities \u0096 not just Hiltons \u0096 and based on the story. I know it was clich\u00e9d and cheesy at some points, but generally I think it was a good idea, and in fact, honestly, the very end scene, on the pier did move me. That scene between the other two actors (JOEL MOORE and CHRISTINE LAKIN) showed that there WAS evidence of good acting, and that this movie could have done better.So, if you like Romantic comedies and can spare Hilton in this, then I would say, see this movie. It's not amazing and it probably doesn't deserve more than 5 stars, but it will give you some laughs and it would also annoy those IMDb users who vote 1's because they are either immature, stupid, or jealous.Also, don't read reviews from the likes of ROLLING STONES and others. Because what those pompous idiots write is frankly rubbish. They are just middle to upper class idiots who don't understand the meaning of \"fun\". They also write reviews as if they were judging the film against all time greats such as The Godfather. That's not what a review is supposed to do! In fact, I never read reviews because I want to make my own mind up about films. So, that's why I say, you might read this and think I'm praising the film. No, I'm just saying that there is worse out there and that IMDb users should really THINK before they write USELESS reviews and give BIAS votes! You might go see this movie. You might not. You might love it. You might hate it.But whatever you do. Don't be influenced by anyone else and remember that one member of cast doesn't make or break a movie.",

Far from being the most important being on the planet, Cristabel genuinely cares about her best friend. June's sadness and desperation about her appearance is well portrayed, and I sympathise with her. Cristabel's support and friendship is so important to her. This friendship and dedication deserves to be celebrated. Often we do judge people by their appearance, and ironically a Paris Hilton film reminds us that this is not right.Maybe there is little acting, but the pleasant sets and the youthful energy balances it and makes \"The Hottie & the Nottie\" a nice popcorn flick. It doesn't need any bathroom humour or gratuitous sex scenes to spice up the film, because it is already enjoyable.I actually find \"The Hottie & the Nottie\" enjoyable.

In my opinion this movie gets an extremely low rating because people don't like Paris Hilton. They don't like her \"party girl\" life style and she comes across as shallow. In this movie she plays a character that is the opposite of her real life persona. So if you don't have a problem, dislike, jealousy, envy, etc with Paris Hilton you should enjoy this movie. If you still don't like it and you want to rate it then try watching \"birdemic\" or \"going overboard\" first as these should be the standard for judging all one star movies.

            "content": "I think it says a lot about this film that Paris Hilton is amongst the better performers. The actor she's playing opposite has slightly less emotional depth than a block of wood and seems to be reading his lines off cue cards held over other performers' shoulders.The script is utterly unbelievable. I'm prepared to suspend disbelief for many films, I'm a big fan of fantasy and Sci-Fi. If, however, you want to set a film in the real world and, more importantly, if you want to send a real world message then you need a believable story line. There are many unbelievable things in this film but the biggest is that Christabel would still be friends with June 20 years later. I can accept that they could be friends in first grade and maybe even stayed friends as far as 5th or 6th, but as soon dating hit Christabel would be out of there and June would be road kill, along with their friendship.1 out of 10, but only because you can't give negative scores. The only good thing about the film is wardrobe. Some people have praised make up, but frankly any live action role play group has someone who can make an attractive person look ugly.Stephen",

It was a lovely film which kept me watching to the end to find out if he ends up with one of the 2 girls. I know a lot of people will rate this as a 1 straight away because Paris Hilton is in it. Give the film a chance :) I'm no Paris Hilton fan by the way but do find it unfair people rate badly just because she's in a film. She's not the best actress but she's in no way as bad as some others out there. E.g some of these found footage films e.g Blair witch (which amazingly scored way higher than this) Overall the film had some funny moments and you get to know each character's personality and find yourself wanting the ugly girl to get a date.",

Nothing whatsoever is good about it, it is lazy, mean-spirited and unfunny and many other things. It looks alright though, some of the scenery is nice but the camera work is rushed and there are times when it doesn't feel like a movie. The music is awful, it is enough to make you want to cover your ears because it is sheer torture, while the direction is non existent. The script is one of The Hottie and the Nottie's worst assets, it is terrible. I didn't laugh once, actually I was groaning most of the time, while the story(basically an ugly duckling turned beautiful twist) is completely predictable and badly developed so you didn't care for the characters and their situations. I almost forgot to mention how hypocritical this movie is, I thought I'd seen the last of hypocrisy with The Hannah Montana movie, but the hypocrisy here makes the hypocrisy in that film seem subtle. The acting is a joke. As dire as Paris Hilton was, she cannot act if her life depended on it, she isn't entirely to blame, none of her co-stars were any good either. All in all, terrible and dare I say embarrassing. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "I don't even remember how I stumbled on this movie I missed on its 2008 release two weeks ago March 21, but on reading its reviews and finding most to be as bad as they are, I had to see it for myself. I thus ordered it March 27, received it two days ago and have been a laughing at it all weekend! Paris Hilton was not the star of this comedy-fest from the beginning; Joel David Moore steals that designation as the fool-in-love geek out to claim the girl of his dreams that he hadn't seen since the first grade! Whoooo--ooh! I'm still laughing at the irony of such an unsightly guy being fed on how to gain the hand of the lovely and still single Cristobel from his fat geeky (and equally-named) friend Arno Blount, who has no girlfriend and lives with his presumed widowed decorator mother from another era Mrs. Blount in a blunt-trauma-to-the-head relationship smacking of son-worship! Writer was dead-on on this one: although I understand why it only brought $27,000+ U.S. box-office on its 2008 release\u0085! Being it that a person with bad teeth would not warrant the $27 value of a slave to the master who would not want to pay for the parents' negligence or disease, why is it that in this movie, writer Heidi Ferrer who did not do her research, went to great pains to show us how it was that Joel Moore's character of Nate Cooper fell in love with Paris Hilton's character of Cristobel Abbott in the first grade where her lifelong friendship with Christine Lakin's character of the repugnant June Phigg began but gave us no detail as to how it was that June was as equally repulsive twenty years later at twenty six? Was she born to parents in a hospital or hatched in a car trunk amidst a nest of chickens and raised thusly? Because for a woman to have alopecia, skin lesions, a hideous carbuncle on her chin with a whisker growing out of it, a disease-blackened toenail, no muscle tone in her entire body, no dress sense whatsoever and teeth as misaligned and rotted as June's in a statement she hadn't seen a dentist since they came in that way at age eleven, both her mother and her father implicated for criminal negligence and ruination of their daughter that could only get her a minimum-wage job after high school graduation at the city zoo cutting up raw fish to feed the animals or cleaning up toilets, if that, should both have been stabbed, shot, strangled, bludgeoned, quartered, eaten and then vomited back and flushed down any toilet that June left to go though life with a mouth as messed up as hers could not have gotten hired to clean up! I mean, even Johann Urb as the buff dentist that came to the rescue and took interest in correcting June's teeth caught Nate in his greatly detailed lie about having no pilot's license but taking children up in his plane and flying them recklessly for sport, which would be criminal negligence on the part of any UNLICENSED pilot! Martin Lawrence did the rotten-teeth thing with his mock character of \"player\" Jerome to repugnant perfection in his 1990s TV show \"Martin,\" but what woman ever dated Jerome? Not even Lawrence's brusque-spoken braid-sporting hard-voiced hairdresser alter-ego character of Shenaynay could have been paid the value of her salon to date Jerome! Perhaps had Ferrer factored into her script that June's parents and family had been murdered or abandoned her and June had been thrown away and thus left with the mess of her lack of beauty to correct on her own with no means to do so because no one would have dealings with anyone that physically repulsive, all who had hated this movie as the worst crime to be committed against an audience would have COMMISERATED with her misfortune and then derived HUMOR from all the funny shtick and lies ugly-duckling-geek himself Nate carried out to get her a date with a man little better than him in order to get next to Cristobel! And while the ending explained how it was that Nate suddenly found himself falling for June after her transformation from \"nottie\" to likely, not very many a guy with a no-name job or known salary would drive a loser car that wouldn't have made it to his home state line 3,000 miles across the U.S. and then offer to pay a guy $1,500.00 to date a cold-ugly woman in order to get next to her hot-gorgeous best friend holding out on every guy hitting her up to that end\u0085and with the \"hottie\" friend having made no effort to beautify her \"nottie\" best-friend- since-the-first-grade in TWENTY YEARS! And how Christine Lakin, beautiful tomboy daughter \"Al\" from the 1990s TV show \"Step-By-Step\" managed to work her jaws, lips and tongue around the awful prosthetics the makeup department fitted over her perfect teeth in order for her to speak as naturally as she did and let herself be laughed at in this hideous ugly-duckling-turned-incredibly- beautiful-swan mock-romantic comedy is beyond me\u2014as the TRUE star in this satire, she should have taken home an award!",

I only downloaded it because I was curious to see if Paris Hilton improved her acting skills, and to see how ugly they made Christine Lakin look. Paris should just keep on doing what she does best. Party, and spend her family's money, because honestly, that is more entertaining to watch and read about then watch her pretend to run and have an ugly best friend.Was Lakin's character straight? I understand that she's supposed to be straight and likes guys but she's so hideously ugly that she can't get men, but when guys are coming up to Cristabel to hit on her, she kind of acted like she was the girlfriend, like they were a lesbian couple. Lakin, come on! I love you in Step By Step and you're a total hottie (I'm a straight woman myself), but the angry best friend bit was too much. Taking things out of Wedding Crashers was uncool (the scene when Arno yells at his mom to bring him the file reminded of the scene when Will Ferrell's character yells at his mom to make them meatloaf). And Paris, THERE IS NO LAUGHING IN ACTING! How many hours and takes did that scene when Cristabel supposedly farted did that take? The funniest part of the movie was in the first 10 min or so when Nate is still living in Rhode Island and breaks up with his girlfriend.I don't understand how some people rated this movie above a 1. Honestly, those people need to spend their money watching other time worthy movies currently out like 21, Street Kings (and I also think Keanu Reeves is a dense actor, so that is saying a lot), and Horton Hears A Who!

The dialogue was bad as well. At some points I was even wondering if the bad acting was Paris' fault. because it must be hard to make a decent performance with such a horribly written character and such horrible lines.My other problem was that the whole ugliness of the Nottie was exaggerated. It was almost like a farce. I understand their point, they wanted to show that what matters is personality and that even such incredibly ugly person can become good looking. But they kind of failed with it considering that Nate didn't get how he feels for June until she went through all her operations and stopped being ugly.Giving this movie a 1 is a total exaggeration though.

What I like about the themes of this particular movie: -> Paris' character of being a faithful friend to someone unfortunate. I wonder if Paris Hilton can stay in any long-term relationship in real-life? -> Paris' philosophy about the human soul vs body and how we look on the outside. -> The revealing \"flashback\" story-telling technique that is used to explain present relationships in relation to the past. If you want a good laugh and a little learning philosophy in how humans judge others, watch this movie. I also recommend the movie \"Shallow Hal\" which is just as good.",

No wonder it received a Razzie Award. I was sitting comfortable in my sofa and pressed the button. The movie started. After the first 2 minutes, I was wondering how many neurons i had lost. The opening showed the great \"diva\" Paris Shiton gathering all men's views. It was pathetic and totally unrealistic. I bet 10 $ that I would resist more than 20 minutes. After 10 hard to digest minutes that included horrible acting and scenes I was on the right way of getting something from this garbage: 10 $. The movie reached the climax when the main character, an unbelievably bad actor it i can't call him like this, went to a gym in an attempt to \"conquer\" the nottie. Suddenly, i heard my neurons screaming, i grabbed the 10 $ banknote and threw it to my friend. I closed the TV as fast as i could hopping that a few of my nerve cells have escaped.

            "review_title": "A mean-spirited premise, but not THAT bad a movie.",
            "content": "There is a fundamentally screwed up notion that destroys this film at the onset. While Paris Hilton is cast as the 'hottie', most people (at least based on the IMDb scores of her films) find her repellent. Usually hating someone or finding them revolting is NOT what you'd look for in a hottie--an annoying term to begin with, by the way. If the film were called something like \"America's Most Hated Woman and the Nottie\" or \"The Attention-Getting Media Whore and the Nottie\" then it might have worked. As is, many were turned off by the very premise of the film--and you could sure tell with a current IMDb rating of 1.8 (placing it at #42 on the IMDb Bottom 100 list).Speaking of premise, the idea of this film is really, really tacky and gross--sort of like the \"No fat chicks\" bumper stickers on some loser's car. Nate has been infatuated with a girl (Cristabel) he hasn't seen since grade school has decided to move to California and try to win her. But, because she hangs out with an 'ugly' friend (June), his friend tells him to get the ugly one out of the way--then, and only then, will he have a chance with the hottie! So, he's got to find a boyfriend for the ugly girl to win the pretty one--what a lovely and unselfish sort of notion!!!!!!!! To make this 'nottie' unattractive, they make her look like some sort of troll (with freakish teeth, sores, hairy legs,ugly clothes, a huge mole, a uni-brow, facial hair and is semi-bald)--subtle this ain't! She is so over-the-top unattractive that she is more a caricature than a real person. As for the sweet hottie, it turns out that she isn't particularly interested in finding her unattractive friend a boyfriend\u2014\"just an orgasm\". Well, it's nice to see she has her priorities straight. What an uplifting premise and a film sure to become part of the Criterion Collection.To get June a man, Nate advertises--offering $500 to anyone willing to date her. The guy Nate gets seems willing but when they meet the new girlfriend, he jumps into the water and swims off into the distance. So, to convince this guy to go through with the bargain, in the next scene, you see Nate and his friend giving home aversion therapy to him--zapping him with electricity whenever they show him pictures of attractive women (this is actually kind of funny). In the next scene, you see he's now infatuated with June...but it doesn't last.Next, a midget mime makes fun of June--drawing a picture of her as a donkey. And, a nice guy out of the crowd hates this--and punches the crap out of the little guy. So, the film has insulted unattractive people AND midgets. Now I wanted to see the rest of the film just to see who they'd offend next! The mime-puncher is Johann. He's a Harvard grad, pilot, ex-marine, cover model and dentist. Johann is so wonderful and handsome that Nate is now worried that Cristabel will prefer Johann. So Nate begins lying (thanks to his dumb friend's suggestion) to impress her. In essence, anything that Johann can do, Nate can do it better. The problem is that Johann is so perfect, Nate just looks like a sad jerk (which, in fact, he is).Later, June gets a dental implants, takes Rogaine and gets the hair/moles removed. Now she is beautiful and Nate is quite smitten by her--and eventually more so to her than Cristabel--though it takes the dummy a while to notice. So I think the moral is that if an unattractive lady spends a lot of money and plastic surgery, she's NOW worth having. Now that's an object lesson to teach your kids! Overall, this film could have worked a lot better but still wasn't THAT bad a film despite it's somewhat mean-spirited premise. With a different hottie AND with a nottie who was not just a silly caricature, the film could have worked. However, with Hilton in the film (who currently has four films on IMDb's hallowed Bottom 100 list), the film was doomed to get low scores--from many who simply dislike her for who she is as opposed to just her acting ability. The film has good story elements and could be re-worked into a decent film. Too bad the good moments in the film were overshadowed by an abundance of shallow and unlikable moments.Oh, and as far as Paris Hilton goes, I hate to say this but she wasn't that bad and she's done far, far worse films (like PLEDGE THIS and THE HILLZ). Not a great endorsement, I know, but I can't in good conscience trash her just because it's so easy and fashionable. I still wouldn't have put her in this film, but she has shown improvement in her acting skills.",

Being an actor you have to at least learn to play another type of person, than the person you are in real life. She has to start believing that her body can adjust to numerous different roles and characters than simply a megalomaniac, massive ego (probably the biggest I've ever seen), arrogant hot chick. But if she so desperately wants to be taken seriously as an actress, why doesn't she just try to play someone else than always that same person that everybody wants to be around and that all the guys dream of. You know, I think Paris Hilton is a beautiful woman, I always have.

I happened to watch this movie with and open mind and guess what? I loved it! Sure this movie isn't Oscar material however, it's a fun, warm movie. The acting is OK and even Paris does a decent job. Her character is perfect for the role. The character of \"June\"(Lakin) was done well but I feel that they did go a little overboard with her \"flaws\". I know girls that have friends like that and it was pretty much on par with how they act. I'd be bitter and angry too! As for Joel Moore, I just couldn't stop thinking about \"mmmm I HATE YOUR FACE!\" and \"How can they see me!??\" from Grandma's Boy! Haha, I guess that's burned in my mind forever.Anyway, This is a super cute movie and any decent-hearted person would appreciate it even if you do not like Paris Hilton which I personally do not like NOR dislike. She is quite pretty but MY GOODNESS did \"June\" turn out to be a gorgeous woman! Give it a chance!",

After about 20 years Nate meets up with this Cristabel gal and finds out she is very popular with the guys but she will not date or even get married until her friend, June Prigg, (Christine Lakin) meets a guy and falls in love. However, June Prigg is not just your ordinary gal and she has plenty of surprises for any young man wanting to take her on a date. Nate decides to figure out a way in order to get someone to date June which turns into a complete disaster.

            "content": "I am writing this review to persuade you that Paris Hilton's scribblings feed on ressentiment of inferiors towards their superiors. I will persuade you of this by providing a few examples and illustrations of the way in which Hilton seeks to bury our heritage, our traditions, and our culture. First and foremost, she should learn to appreciate what she has instead of feeling so oppressed because she can't do everything she wants, every time she wants to. Although she occasionally exhibits a passable simulacrum of rationality, I have begged Hilton's emissaries to step forth and convince repugnant firebrands to stop supporting Hilton and tolerating her pronouncements. To date, not a single soul has agreed to help in this fashion. Are they worried about how Hilton might retaliate? The answer is not obvious because Hilton's a psychologically defective person. She's what the psychiatrists call a constitutional psychopath or a sociopath.The nature and extent of our current national crisis, as well as its causes and cures, are the subject of intense political struggle. I offer this review as a contribution to that struggle and debate in hopes of helping to oppose our human vices wherever they may be found -- arrogance, hatred, jealousy, unfaithfulness, avarice, and so on. What follows is a series of remarks addressed to the readers of this letter and to Paris Hilton herself.One of the goals of philistinism is to render meaningless the words \"best\" and \"worst\". Hilton admires that philosophy because, by annihilating human perceptions of quality, Hilton's own mediocrity can flourish. She even condones the odious slurs that will prevent me from getting my work done. If she thinks that she can make me crawl under a rock and die then she's barking up the wrong tree. I have one final message for you before ending this letter: One of history's clearest lessons is that since their emergence on the stage of history, obdurate sexism enthusiasts have been a parasitic growth on the stem of true citizens.Hilton doesn't want to acknowledge that her apologists are stampeding happily and mindlessly toward the precipice of purblind careerism. In fact, Hilton would rather block all discussion on the subject. I suppose that's because she cannot be tamed by \"tolerance\" and \"accommodation\" but is actually spurred on by such gestures. Hilton sees such gestures as a sign of weakness on our part and is thereby encouraged to continue turning heresiarchs loose against us good citizens. To those fork-tongued administrators who think that Hilton acts in the public interest, know this: We cannot afford to waste our time, resources, and energy by dwelling upon inequities of the past. Instead, we must keep our priorities in check. Doing so would be significantly easier if more people were to understand that that fact is simply inescapable to any thinking man or woman. \"Thinking\" is the key word in the previous sentence. Stand with me, be honest with me, and help me condemn Paris Hilton's criminal ineptitude, and together we'll show principle, gumption, verve, and nerve. We'll advance freedom in countries strangled by tyranny. I'm counting on you. Thanks for reading this.",

But, in my only defense, I only watched this trash for the How Did This Get Made? podcast.I don't think I have the patience or desire to waste too much time on how many, many, many things were wrong with this film, but suffice to say it was horribly shot with far too many unnecessary closeups, horribly written, cliched, predictable and once again shows how paper thin Paris Hilton is, inside/out. But, I will give this movie two positives, just to be fair.Despite his awful character, actor Joel David Moore *was* trying throughout and the music wasn't that bad. In fact, I kinda liked some of the catchy music. But, playtime is over.The movie's about a shallow guy's attempt to keep a 1st grade crush alive many, many years later, but must fake like/help her purposely hideous friend so he can get laid. And you will know, from minute one, where this is headed.Paris is such a distraction. From being super plastic, to existent acting to very non-existent acting, to just trying to flirt with the camera, her ever presence onscreen makes me cringe. But, she's not the only dark stain here. It's the exact same I've said about her as the \"comedy.\" This is supposed to be a comedy and I laughed not once.Fine. I must be honest. I smirked once for sure, maybe twice. I never laughed. None of this was funny. I see where there's supposed to be jokes. I just never once saw one land.If you're a fan of How Did This Get Made? and you want to see this like I did for their episode devoted to this trash, you might be pleased to know as of, at least, 1/15/20, this movie is available for free for Amazon Prime members. I'm just relieved I didn't contribute a single cent to these bad filmmakers.***Final thoughts: Did secondary character Arno played by Greg Romero Wilson really make them list him as \"The Greg Wilson?\" Okay, fine, that might be the one joke that landed.",

Nate only liked June now because she wasn't ugly anymore so the point this movie was trying to make like don't judge a book by it's cover may have fallen short. You could overlook that with the vibe the music gave and find it adorable but that would be denial.

            "content": "I get it that it was fashionable to trash Paris Hilton for her airhead and celebutante ways. I understand that she didn't do anything to make herself popular or shed her party girl image. And I see how people would say she's a bad role model for our youth based on her lifestyle. But none of that really should be taken into account when it comes to her acting. She is after all playing a character in this movie and not herself. But on the other hand, she proved that she's not much of an actress and this movie was a vanity project from the start. A vanity project is something that is done for the express purpose of making somebody feel better. It plays on their status as a famous person or more importantly plays up who they are. A good example of this, other than this movie of course, is Mariah Carey's \"Glitter\" which is a semi-fictional version of her rise to fame. That too was rightfully trashed by the critics who saw right through it. In this movie Paris Hilton plays the titular \"Hottie\" by the name of \"Cristabelle\". That's the movie's first mistake. Paris Hilton isn't that hot although if you like cocaine thin vapid airheads then I guess she's your type. But most people will admit she isn't that pretty. She has an ugly friend, the so called \"Nottie\" named \"June\" and played by the much prettier Christine Lakin in heavy ugly makeup.Enter Nate who has been in love with Cristabelle since elementary school and finds out she's single. The problem is Cristabelle won't go out with anybody until June has a date. Well what's a guy like Nate supposed to do? He'll lie, cheat and do everything in his power to get June a date just so that he can be with Cristabelle. Isn't that sweet? He tries to bribe people, hypnotize them and even convinces a handsome plastic surgeon to give her free facial work to improve her odds. What a guy.In the end, when June has been made pretty Nate suddenly realizes that he's in love with her and they wind up together. So nice isn't it? Or at least it would be if you really thought what this movie was telling people. That is, if you're not \"perfect\" like Cristabelle then you need to literally change your face so that people can fall in love with you. It's not what's inside that counts, it's how beautiful you look on the outside.And that is one of the worst messages you can send anybody. Thankfully this did so poorly that nobody ever asked Paris to do another movie.",

The acting is a bit poor and most of the jokes aren't laugh out loud, when they're even there to begin with; but I never had that sense of the movie being actually painful to watch, which is to me the real mark of an awful film that deserves to be trashed at the level this has been.The biggest flaw of course is that the \"Nottie\", even with all the makeup they put on her, doesn't look much worse than Paris Hilton; and definitely not gaspingly ugly as she's meant to be. She looks less like a truly ugly person than like someone suffering from drug addiction. Most people see this type on the street all the time and don't think much of it. The script is basic and predictable, but not godawful. It seems like the kind of thing that might have been a basic-cable made-for-TV type film had not Hilton gotten her hands on it.",

To be fair, I haven't finished the film but no surprises or plot turns ever arrive to keep me watching. A film school is needed to show terrible movies like this to before the general public can be victimized next. Now that I have seen the end, the second worst thing about this movie is a false conception about men in general. Boys rarely form infatuations with girls in the first and second grade. The ending was contrived to match some sort of saccharine cookie cutter plan that no one would ever believe or easily relate to.

Basically Nate Cooper (Joel David Moore) is unable to have any real relationship with women, he cannot get his childhood crush out of his head, so he sets out for the beaches of California to find her, meeting up with geeky best friend Arno Blount (The Greg Wilson), whose mother Mrs. Blount (Marianne Muellerleile) has all the information about the girl. Soon enough he finds his first love; tall, attractive, blonde Cristabel Abbott (Razzie winning Paris Hilton, also producing), who always jogs along the beach, many wannabe suitors sit on the benches to try and catch her eye, including creepy albino stalker Randy (Scott Prendergast). Cristabel is still single, and the big reason for this is because she is still the best friend of short, unattractive brunette girl June Phigg (Christine Lakin), who is covered in moles, warts and bad skin and with hair possibly thinning, Nate knew her is school as well. Nate reintroduces himself to Cristabel and they hit it off quickly, but she refuses to go on a date unless June has a date as well, Nate tries to find a boyfriend for her, but all men recoil at the sight of her. One day at the Santa Monica Pier, attractive dentist and part-time model Johann Wulrich (Johann Urb) appears, he apparently sees June's inner beauty and seems to want to give her a makeover, however Nate believes he could get in the way of his advances towards Cristabel, but Johann starts dating June, and Nate finally gets to date Cristabel. As the weeks pass Nate and June becomes friends, as she slowly comes out of his shell, and her face and appearance seem to be improving, to the point where she is becoming as attractive as Cristabel, Nate realises that perhaps she is the girl of her dreams. Finally Nate gets an opportunity to have sex with Cristabel, but despite knowing she is hot and willing, he turns her down to find the now beautiful June, Cristabel tells him she is happy for him and her best friend, Nate finds June and opens up about how he feels for her, in the end they embrace with a kiss. Also starring Adam Kulbersh as Cole Slawsen, Kathryn Fiore as Jane and Erin Cardillo as Yoga Teacher. Paris Hilton has only succeeded with a \"career\" in modelling, and 6 series in The Simple Life with equally stupid Nicole Richie (Lionel's adoptive daughter), everything else she's tried has failed, including other bad acting roles, like House of Wax, and the appalling reality TV show My New BFF, she is the obvious \"hottie\" of the title, mainly in it just to look sexy, that's about it. It is not necessarily Hilton that is the biggest problem with this film, Moore is annoying, and Lakin for a while is unfairly a laughing stock, the ugly duckling formula is done badly, there is disgusting and offensive stuff going on, the love story is pretty predictable, and it is just mostly messy, a terrible romantic comedy. It won the Razzie for Worst Screen Couple for Hilton and EITHER Lakin OR Moore, and it was nominated the Worst Picture, Worst Director for Tom Putnam and Worst Screenplay, and Hilton won Worst Actress of the Decade.

It's an awesome movie to kickback with on lazy day.If you forget for a moment that it's Paris Hilton, this movie is on the surface of it a fun and funny movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Really easy to watch. I'm giving it a 10/10 because there are so many negative biased reviews that aren't being fair to this title. They are not judging this movie on its merit. It's actually a good movie if you want something casual and fun to watch for an evening. Some comedy gold in this. I can't believe this was not more widely received. It kept me engaged the whole time.",

For the most part everything is mediocre, but there are two main reasons why this film is bad. One is Paris Hilton. Paris is considered by everyone including me as one of the worst actresses in film today. She has the characteristics of a hoar. Selling her hot body to audience, but having no real emotion or passion leaving you disgusted after watching a movie from her. She is the stereotype of the skinny blond that gets all the guys, and I simply hate her for it. She is the girl who will call the everyday person trash even though 99% of them have a higher I.Q. The other thing is the message it sends. There is no way to bash the moral if I don't say the ending so SPOILERS!!!! In the end the guy goes with June the ugly girl after she became good looking. This sends the message that he only realized he liked her when she stopped being ugly. So the moral is love can be found when you stop being ugly, and start being hot. What an awful moral that makes this an awful movie.1 star out of 4",

I'm not here to lambaste this other film, but hope it serves as an example of the unjust ranking system. Christine Lakin's performance more than makes up for Hilton's wooden performance (does she even have expressions?) I'd say anyone can enjoy a mindless romp with this film. Not every movie need be some profound meditation on life. This film is entertaining at best and escapism at worst. While this movie isn't the greatest, it wouldn't kill you to see it.

It barely deserves 1*.There are no redeeming factors WHATSOEVER. It's not entertaining, it's not funny, and it's almost as dumb as the lead \"actress\" is in real life.The best actor of them all was Nate... and his \"talent\" wouldn't normally carry him past playing movie extras. The rest were MUCH worse than that.Everything in this movie is exaggerated -- so much that it's not funny, but annoying and embarrassing.This movie is a pathetic rip-off. It is based on \"There's Something About Mary\" -- also kind of dumb, but at least funny and entertaining, which is MUCH more than can be said for this piece of crap.(1) Nate and Nate's friend (with the weirdo mother) are not at all convincing. They should star in the remake of Kevin & Perry -- though I don't think they'd even manage to pull THAT off.(2) Christabel is presented as THE hottest woman in the city (or state). She is supposed to be SO \"hot\" that she has her own stalkers club, and guys are lining up every morning, with binoculars, to see her jog?? Come on, man! Christabel is played by pigeon-face Paris Hilton, in the name of f***! Are you kidding me? Is this taking place in a blind people's home or something? I think the movie wouldn't be THIS much of a disaster if the \"nottie\" was portrayed by Paris Hilton instead. But she is essentially portraying herself - a dumb bimbo, who wholeheartedly (but mistakenly) believes that she's \"hot\". (3) They have SERIOUSLY f***ed up June Phigg with that terrible makeup. Way over the top. They were trying to get across that the girl is ugly, but she looked ill, not ugly. No one looks THAT bad unless they're ill or disabled.All this movie does, is make fun of someone's not-so-good looks (June), in order to make Paris Hilton appear attractive next to her. Honestly, there's nothing more to it. This is not a movie; it's one of Paris Hilton's whims, which was, most likely, sponsored by her, too.Did they REALLY have to make June look THAT bad? Probably yes, because Paris Hilton was playing the \"hottie\" i.e. in order to create the illusion that Paris Hilton is actually \"hot\", you'd really have to place someone as terribly hideous as June right next to her.This movie is like a very long self-promotion commercial produced with one purpose only -- to satisfy Paris Hilton's ego/vanity.

The story is supposedly touching, but the moral lessons seem highly questionable. What we learn from the movie is basically: always go for the girl with inner beauty, but wait until she gets a make-over and starts looking like Christine Lakin.

The scene then shifts to many years later with the adult \"Nate Cooper\" (now played by Joel David Moore) having a serious breakup with his girlfriend \"Jane\" (Kathryn Fiore) and deciding to travel all the way from Maine to Los Angeles to pursue the one girl he has truly loved ever since the first grade: \"Cristabel Abbot\" (now played by Paris Hilton). However, he soon discovers that, because Cristabel is so beautiful, that there are a great number of other guys who are also quite interested as well. Not only that, but making matters even more difficult is the fact that Cristabel has a best friend since childhood named \"June Phigg\" (Christine Lakin) who acts as her first line of defense and successfully chases away all suitors with her unbelievable ugliness. So, to remedy that problem, Nate does everything he can to find someone to date June in order to spend more time with Cristabel. The problem is that this is much harder than he realizes. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that, even though the overall plot was quite predictable, this film had a certain amount of potential if handled correctly. Unfortunately, the director (Tom Putnam) obviously didn't know what he was doing as he took a rather simple story and totally ruined it by making June much too ugly and disgusting to be even remotely entertaining. That being said, although I cannot fathom what his thought processes were when making this movie, what I can say is that I was pretty much repulsed by it. In short, the only reason I didn't rate this film even lower is because of a few scenes involving Nate's best friend \"Arno Blount\" (Greg Romero Wilson) which were quite funny. But other than that, this movie was an abject failure and I would not recommend it to anybody.",

            "content": "Nate Cooper (Joel David Moore) is an unemployed failure who's just been dumped (and nearly killed) by his latest girlfriend. Realizing his heart has never been with any of his girlfriends, Nate heads to Los Angeles to find his childhood crush, Cristobel (Paris Hilton), his childhood best friend, Arno (The Greg Wilson), has been living with his mother and keeping tabs on Cristobel with an extensive filing system and reveals Cristobel still maintains a friendship with June Phigg (Christine Lakin) her ugly best friend or as Arno calls her the \"Nottie\" to Cristobels \"Hottie\". When Nate runs into Cristobel he's horrified to find she's put a hiatus on dating until June finds someone so Nate takes it upon himself to find anyone willing to date the \"Nottie\" so he can claim the \"Hottie\"Released in 2008, the film was Paris Hilton's one attempt to headline a theatrical film following a largely forgotten and ignored National Lampoon Direct-to-Video film, Pledge This! And a supporting role in the House of Wax remake. Upon initial release the film was savaged by critics, many of whom placed it on their worst of the year lists and made a paltry $27,000 dollars in the United States against a $9 million budget. Internationally it fared little better, barely breaking $1 million. While the film is certainly a vanity project with its premise built around Hilton's \"Hotness\", it's not even a good vanity project as its completely lacking in good writing, good direction, or even a good supporting cast.The movie's lead of Joel David Moore's Nate is easily one of the worst leading comic performances I've seen in a romantic comedy. Not only is Joel David Moore playing the pathetic loser trope up to the nth degree, but scenes of him lusting over Cristobel come off as massively creepy including a scene during the \"meet-cute\" where Nate follows behind Cristobel on her jog without her knowing and sniffing her hair. Moore has shown himself to be a more than capable comic presence in films like Dodgeball or Grandma's Boy, but in both of those he was a supporting player for a good reason. He doesn't have appeal as a leading man. Paris Hilton basically coasts off her looks not so much \"acting\" as standing in reading lines in a voice that doesn't even change octaves. Easily the worst performance in the film goes to the credited \"The Greg Wilson\" playing a creepy overgrown man-child who treats his mother like a secretary and keeps an extensive filing system on Cristobel in another misfire of a joke that feels like it was put there to make Nate look less creepy by comparison (NO! I hate them both!).Speaking of the jokes, there's basically two types: Men stumbling and drooling over themselves as they leer at Cristobel or hackneyed gross out jokes around the character June and overdone reactions thereof. Poor Christine Lakin is clearly trying and gives the \"best\"(albeit still not great, but no one in this movie makes it out in tact) performance but virtue of at least being able to express a diverse range but is buried under overdone make-up effects and obvious facial and mouth prosthetics for the sake of stupid jokes. The movie tries to excuse its stupidity by going for a \"beauty on the inside\" type approach, but it lingers on characters being grossed out borderline gynecological shots of Paris Hilton that are so transparent that it's clear this message is about as hollow as the film's box office receipts. The movie is basically a lesser version of the Farrelly Brothers Shallow Hal which was already a pretty flawed movie in its delivery of the same premise, but it had sincerity to it that made it more forgivable. There's nothing \"sincere\" about The Hottie and the Nottie, it's a cynical attempt to ape the Farrelly Brothers style of raucous gross out humor without actually understanding why it works and instead just hoping that Paris Hilton's name will be enough sell tickets.",

The movie is one that actually makes you laugh and genuinely feel good at the end.The whole story of a childhood crush with the possibility of making that dream come true is a fantasy many of us still think about. The discovery of what your dream truly is makes it even better. Enjoy this movie with family and friends.",

All there is to a romantic comedy is really some contrived conflict of some kind and two characters who have to suffer through a lot of awkward moments until they finally end up together. Unless the characters and dialog are really well written and well acted, that kind of movie becomes pretty pointless.The Hottie & the Nottie takes the whole concept of pointless conflict interspersed with awkward moments, to the very extreme, combining it with characters that could not exist in real life and inane dialog; and for good measure, they've thrown in a massive amount of gross out jokes that do not help either. To top it all off, they make an attempt at ending with a moral, when the ugly girl turns out to be the one the protagonist really loves. The message falls flat however, as he only falls in love with her AFTER she ha a make over.",

I thought he was great when i saw in an episode of Criminal Minds, but this film really shows off his potential as a great actor. I look forward to seeing his career take off. So overall if your looking for a funny film and good acting i would recommend The Hottie & the Nottie. Fingers crossed The Hottie & the Nottie 2 is in the pipeline.",

Make your own decisions and make your own opinions. I actually enjoyed everyones role in this movie. After seeing some of Paris' past work i wasn't sure how she was going to do, but she really pulled it off. Showing she can learn and be adaptive and it has paid off making her a good actress in her own right. Anyone who judges this movie based solely on the fact that Paris is in it is ridiculously biased.

Though she is open to him, she plans to keep her romantic interests on hold until her ugly friend gets a boyfriend with predictable results.The writing is awful, the main character is just utterly unlikeable and downright manipulative, and the other characters except for the ugly girl, are all utterly stupid and rather unpleasant people. As usual in Hollywood comedy, they make the friend up not merely to look ugly, but to look like the wicked witch of the west, and it looks utterly ridiculous. You can tell right off the bat she's not really ugly and she'll be pretty by the end of the movie, and this will effect the plot. What a surprise. But then her ugliness is played up to such a nauseating degree, it makes Frankie Boyle look discreet. In fact, the only likable and well rounded character turns out to be the ugly girl, but Christine Lakin,, to all intents and purposes, could not save this snore-fest.An utterly nauseating experience, but at least it's not garbage pail kids.",

Even the title makes me cringe, so let that set a tone for what is to come.First off, despite many warnings from other IMDb members, I decided to give this film a shot, letting my own jokes give me a cheap thrill. I'll say this, it makes Twilight look like Star Trek. I wasn't expecting Oscar material, but boy did I get it. Even Oscar the Grouch would be ashamed to have this filth in his trash can.Enough blind insults for now, let me give you the plot (Not that you'll watch this film anyway). Basically one girl has another friend that drives boys away, and she tries to give her a boyfriend. Wow, Shakespeare himself would deem this to be a true literary achievement, he lied. It's bland, generic, uncreative, and a horrible excuse to get Paris Hilton more exposure.I am honestly astonished on how they managed to make a movie, if you would call this one, this amazingly bad. I have to ask, why isn't this lower on the bottom 100? I ask you, why? The money used to make this waste of film could have been used to feed starving Ethiopian children! A showing of this piece of festering trash would be illegal since it'd classify as torture!I implore you, unless you'd like to kill off every brain cell in your noggin, have a severe masochist fetish, or you have a thing for astronomically crappy films, do not, I repeat, DO NOT watch this movie.

Nate can't seem to make up his mind and the back-story (what the character did or felt in the past) was handled very clumsy. The last but not least thing I disliked about this movie was the sitcom-like fashion in which it was produced. This movie almost looks like another episode of Paris Hilton's, even though there are some nice shots far in between.However, there were also good points to this movie. First, we get to see Paris in her panties! For some of you who downloaded Paris Hilton's illegal porn flick this is nothing new but I didn't so I'm quite happy for this scene to happen.I also liked Christine Lakin's performance in this movie.

            "content": "Well,It's true that is really a very bad movie, but not the worst of 2009. The people only hates this movie because of Paris Hilton's egocentric behavior, which is true, but not for the movie itself. The Love Guru is worst than this movie, when I saw it I thought I was going to vomit. This movie is only doesn't make me want to vomit, it is only a waste of time.Maybe if Paris Hilton wouldn't be that selfish, this movie could be better. The others actors aren't that bad, only her, specially on the parts when she sees at the camera and pretends to be hot, and she is not. Other fact that made the movie's quality worst was the script, it was made only to made Paris Hilton look smarter than she really is. She gives stupid metaphors all around the movie!!!!! Moore's performance wasn't really very bad, but it is difficult to look good in a bad movie.My rating is 3/10,as i said, bad but not the worst",
