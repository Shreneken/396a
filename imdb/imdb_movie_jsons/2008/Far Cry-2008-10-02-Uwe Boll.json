Uwe Boll is a director who shows no respect for his audience and doesn't deserve respect when it comes to making movies. He even admitted himself that he does it solely for the money. He is not skilled at all and has got the creativity of an amoeba. But is that a reason for not liking or watching his movies. Well,yes and no. It all comes down to expectation. If you have none than \"Far Cry\" will surprise you. Til Schweiger is well aware of Boll's reputation and doesn't take it seriously which shows and is one of the strong points of the movie. The second strong element are the action scenes which are actually pretty decent and fun to watch. Does this movie has anything to do with the game? Of course not(OK,maybe 1 or 2 elements are taken from the game). Does it have a good story? Guess again. What about the acting? At least it wasn't completely annoying and Til's Jack Carver was very likable. \"Far Cry\" is movie that can be fun if you are able to put your brain off.",

My expectations were way, way down.However, it wasn't as bad as I feared. Now granted, I'm glad I didn't pay money to see it but it was better than some of the drivel I've seen. This, I could actually sit through and didn't think that I was completely wasting my time.The locations and sets were good, the cinematography not bad, the acting let things down a bit and the writing was very, very ordinary. I even found the references to the game (as little as they were) amusing.",

            "content": "One of Bolls better attempts. Just shows that if you do something long enough you have to improve just by chance. It is still not good but it is at least watchable which is an improvement over the bloodrayne. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry really is that the story from Farcry wasn't the games strong point whereas Bloodrayne had a strong story and thus Boll had more chance to mess it up.The action in this movie is actually fairly good. Occasionally a touch overdone but in a good way and worth a watch just for that.Acting wise it was pretty decent. Most of the actors are pretty good but you can tell they aren't taking it seriously based on comparisons with other performances. But the lighter mood this gives to the film actually helps.While I think sticking a little bit closer to the story of the game might have made for a slightly better film the changes made are pretty practical and not big enough to make a difference. Especially given the plot of the game was hardly Oscar winning just a vehicle for FPS carnage. Would have liked it set in the Jungle as that was a pretty integral part of the game but Canada doesn't have a great deal of Jungle and it is at least set in a kind of rainforest.Why Boll feels the need to change already professionally scripted and directed game plots I don't know but he does. And until he starts letting the source material speak through his adaptations will always be lacking. Watch the film for a laugh its good for that and maybe for watching during a party as drinking party fodder.",

Since Uwe Boll is regarded the worst director ever, we expected to see a stupid, bad, ridiculous action movie with a story hardly good enough for a video game.And this was, what we got.This film will just make you laugh all the time. Not for actual jokes in the movie, but more for the ridiculous characters. Come on, a German ex-elite soldier making his living as a boat-captain in Canada, Meets the niece of another German ex-elite-soldier, who works for an evil, mad, German scientist who is trying to create the new Master-Race of biologically modified soldiers for the US-Military...in Canada. Then there are the stereotype Mercenary, the stereotype Soldiers and the stereotype Monsters.Speaking of ridiculous characters, what exactly is Emilio's role in this film? Still, the action was surprisingly good and the movie all in all was very entertaining. If you want to see art, it's your own fault you didn't like the movie. But if you want to see a movie, too ridiculous to be taken serious, I promise you, you will be fine with \"Far Cry\"",

Seeing how the director behind this movie is Uwe Boll which, as a lot of you probably know, isn't a very well liked guy I'm guessing that a lot of people gave this a 1 on principle alone, some of them even without having seen it imagine. Bearing this in mind and having just seen it I can say that while it's far from the best movie I've seen it isn't horrible. I'd say not worth buying but renting this for a lazy Sunday or something isn't wasted money. The dialogue could be better and there's not much in the way of character development or anything but it has solid action through and through. Final verdict 5.5/10 - Worth Watching.",

Good plot and pretty action sequences, maybe the problem is its title \"Far Cry\" I played the game and I noticed that it is completely different but if you forget the title, there are no problems at all. Probably people rated it 1,2 or 3 because of Uwe Boll, it is obvious that people hate him so they dislike its films by deduction. Uwe Boll made bad movies but this deserves at least a 5!

            "content": "I am well aware of Uwe Boll's work, I am also aware that the people on this site are not fond of his work and mercilessly down-rate his productions. That said, I don't think this movie is worth only a 3 or 4 out of 10.The acting wasn't terrible, then again there wasn't much acting to begin with. The movie seemed like something out of the 1980's with its numerous action sequences, a lot of which involved boats, water and explosions.The movie's plot didn't exactly follow the game's, but it worked to some extent. Simply put, there is a crazy scientist genetically engineering soldiers to be super soldiers. One of the normal soldiers on the island decides to organize a meeting with his journalist niece on the island to expose the work and in the process gets caught. The niece hires Jack, a guy who runs his own tourist boat, to get to the island to meet her uncle. She gets caught, Jacks goes to save her and also gets caught. Blah blah blah blah, Jack and the niece escape and live happily ever after...oh and the scientist guy dies. You know, your standard Hollywood movie plot...there's a bad guy, the good guy infiltrates and gets caught, eventually escapes and in the process kills the bad guy and destroys his evil operation.Yeah, at times it drags, and yeah the guy who plays Jack isn't a native American which doesn't really work since the guy in the game comes off as your run-of-the-mill beer drinking American. The action sequences involve fake guns and props which appear to be just that...and yes, we can blame the director as he likes to rush his dreck movies into theaters which allows for little post production time...but the movie worked well. I put it on par with any other fairly rated action movies with similar plots that lack any sort of serious character development...Collateral Damage, Eraser, Escape from LA, Mission Impossible 2, Resident Evil movies, Tango & Cash, xXx, etc. In other words, if you are looking for just another run-of-the-mill action movie where the good guy wins, bad guy loses, and there is no character development, Far Cry is another movie to put on your NetFlix.",

            "content": "Uwe Boll has an unusual distinction. On IMDB's infamous Bottom 100 List, he currently has five movies listed! This is NOT a distinction any normal person would want...though in the case of Boll, somehow studios keep giving him huge budgets, so he's probably laughing all the way to the bank! I have seen his other four entries on the list, \"BloodRayne\", \"House of the Dead\", \"Alone in the Dark\" and \"In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale\". Why? Because I have an odd obsession....to try to watch all 100 on this everchanging list!\"Far Cry\" is odd in that Boll bought the rights to this videogame BEFORE the game was even released. He was lucky...the game was a hit. The public, however, wasn't...as the film stank.The plot is pretty simple. Valerie pays Jack to take her to the island where her Uncle Max works. However, after she arrives, the baddies on the island blow up Jack's boat...and he just barely escapes. Apprently Dr. Krieger* is doing evil stuff on this island and he's not allowing anyone to get in his way! But Jack is an ex-special forces guy...and soon it's him versus all of Krieger's brainless and rather indestructable genetically modified minions.A few things you are likely to notice shortly after the film begins. First, it's ultra-violent....not too unusual for Boll's films. Second, most in the cast sound either German OR they put on very fake and stupid accents in order to try to hide this. In particular, the 'American' couple on the whale trip are among the silliest fake-American accented characters I'd ever heard. Apparently Boll didn't notice...but someone should have noticed this. And, considering the film was made in Canada, there surely were some locals who sounded much more like Americans. The film also abounds with dumb writing mistakes and cliches. When Jack attacks one of the baddies, the baddie makes sure NOT to cry out for help (a common but bad cliche), a helicopter explodes for practically no reason at all, Valerie throws a grenade and forgets to pull the pin (is anyone THAT stupid???), after initially evading the baddies the pair (who just met each other) stop to make whoopie (which is odd since they ARE on an island full of folks wanting to kill them), three soldiers firing at Jack at close range with machine guns....yet he takes them all out with his pistol....and that incredible annoying fat guy with the sandwich....uggh! The bottom line is that the film is terribly written and is, at times, an insult to your intelligence...and it often uses violence and action in place of acting and writing.\n*I found it funny that the mad German scientist, Krieger, is the same name given to the mad German scientist on \"Archer\".",

The special effects and action are acceptable. All other aspects were very disappointing. All I can say is that Kevin Smith (An evening with...) talked about Tim Burton not ever reading the Batman comics and it showed. Uwe Boll must not have ever played the video games that he keeps making movies about. If you two ever want to know how it is done go see Andrzej Bartkowiak. Doom was one of the best video games to film adaptations ever. Some people may disagree, but if you watch the movie you can see that the guys at ID had a lot to do with Doom. It doesn't seem like anyone at UBIsoft was even near this production.",

            "content": "FAR CRY is the film version of a popular video game that I know nothing about. However, I do know something about the career of infamous German director Uwe Boll, a man responsible for the likes of BLOODRAYNE and ALONE IN THE DARK, and commonly thought of as one of our worst modern directors. I'm pleased to report that FAR CRY is by far the best Boll film I've thus watched; it's no masterpiece, that's for sure, but it's reasonably entertaining, unlike the majority of his output.The film contains all of the ingredients usual for a Boll-style B-movie: an ensemble cast of fading faces, lots of low rent action, some cheesy effects and the like, and plenty of clich\u00e9. However, this time around that mix is quite fun. Til Schweiger, the German actor who rose to international prominence after his part in Tarantino's INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, is fine as the likable and humorous hero, and Emmanuelle Vaugier and Natalia Avelon are suitably attractive female co-stars.This film is a German/Canadian co-production which is quite convincing when it comes to the styling. The action scenes are fairly well done and certainly you often see B-movie shoot-outs that are done far worse than the ones here. Some of the old-timer actors playing tough guys include Don S. Davis, Craig Fairbrass, Udo Kier, Michael Pare, and Ralf Moeller. The plot is your usual nonsense about a mad scientist creating an army of super soldiers and the one or two soldiers we do get to see here are pretty impressive, coming across as a zombie version of the ones in UNIVERSAL SOLDIER. Anyway, FAR CRY is no great shakes as a film, but it is a reasonably entertaining B-movie nonetheless.",

ONE, forget the game (even though it is good);TWO,watch this movie empty headed/don't take it seriously; THREE, ignore the bad acting. If you can do these things, then you might actually like it. There were several points in the movie where I was laughing so hard, I was crying. The humor was subtle at times and others it was blatant, but it was still funny.Now, with that being said, it wasn't a quality movie by any means. The action scenes were nice, but not awesome; the acting was sub par, especially the lady in the beginning, \"But George, I want to see the whales!\" This was a part where I was cracking up. Also, the chemistry between Valerie and Jack was, well, interesting. They just sort of, ummm, came together as if they knew each other for a long time. In fact, the character development was the weakest point of the movie, but hey, like I said, condition number two.The ending was good enough, but in the end I felt like nothing was accomplished. It sounds like I hated the movie, but the humor and Shweiger's relaxed feel, even in dire situations, just made this enjoyable. Plus the ending action sequence was cool. Don't watch this if you want a serious, hard core action movie. Watch this if you want to watch a relaxed, not-so-serious movie.Uwe Boll's best video game movie, and the only one worth seeing (renting).",

It's by no means great, but it's still a hell of a lot better than some trash that made it to theaters recently (I'm looking at you, new Friday The 13th). Boll's reputation certainly precedes him so there'll always be a good number of people getting exactly what they expected even if the film wasn't as bad as...say...Bloodrayne. But to be fair, not much is quite as bad as Bloodrayne. This flick is pretty much standard action fair. A bit light on the plot, but have you tried watching anything with Steven Seagal in it...ever? There's gunfights, super soldiers, some somewhat lame attempts at comedy, but in the end it's all a decent way to kill some time.I must confess...I've only played the sequel to Far Cry, never the original so I don't know how faithful the movie is to the game. But Far Cry 2 was simply awful and whatever you may think of Boll, he's usually pretty true to his source material. I mean come on, you can't tell me that the movie version of House Of The Dead was any sillier than the game. Same goes for most of Uwe's ventures into the video-game-gone-movie realm (save for the criminally underrated Postal).The purpose of this is not to make apologies for Mr. Boll. He's made some terrible stuff in the past. Does he deserve an Oscar? No, NO, one thousand times NO! But at least you know what you're in for and can hope for something a little better. And at least he's trying. If I may point further back in this post and point out that Michael Bay seems intent on simultaneously remaking horror movies that don't need to be remade and ruining them all at once.

Jack Carver. Oh well, maybe it's an alias. But in light of the frenetically edited, darkly themed, and super produced Bourne movies among others, this return to basics is pretty enjoyable.

It isn't a summer blockbuster, nor instant classic, but, it was never meant to be. It's a nice straight to DVD action flick which will give you 1,5h solid entertainment. Other than basic stuff (characters, name, enemies), movie is set on different location, and as much faster pacing. Action sequences are nice and solid, and effects are also good considering this is a low budget movie. But that's the point, it IS a low budget title, but looking at it it feels much more expensive. Script is OK, most of the time works well, and I have to say that Jack in the movie has a lot in common with game Jack. Both make fun of almost everything, and are more phlegmatic in nature. Val on the other hand isn't that action oriented as her game counterpart. Kier does very nice job bringing Dr. Krieger to life, and frankly, I like this one better. Nobody but Kier could portrait mad German scientist. The only thing about characters that kinda annoyed me is Jack's noticeable German accent, although Till did excellent Job for the performance part. The only major disappointment what I had with the movie is that location was changed from pacific sand beaches to rocky and cold bay like in western Canada/south Alaska. Considering the budget, I understand and forgive. Film is no award nominee nor winner, but a nice rental on a hot or rainy afternoon to fill a void and have house popcorn fun. 6/10 :) P.S.

Just Don't. Play the game, instead. If you DO watch this, don't go cursing or crying to anyone, because you were warned. The Game was far more dark and intense than this movie could ever be.For everyone else, it can be a chuckle-- even though it is NOT a Comedy or a Spoof. But I SWEAR that Udo Keir (Dr. Kreiger) couldn't help himself because he was delivering some ringing one-liners with a deadpan face that was DARING the viewer to laugh.The other actors can be forgiven their emotive trespasses because this is a Mad Scientist / Monster Movie. No-one expects a Oscar nomination out of this, so don't hold it against them. Be fair. Besides, the wooden, cardboard, plastic, ersatz performances of the Lead characters could be EXACTLY what Uwe wanted. Remember: This Man Sees the Cinematic world through a different lens than the rest of us Mortals. He is an Artiste!!!And several reviewers have commented rather 'objectively' on the 'romantic liaison' that both Viewers AND Actors were subjected to. Again: This is Uwe Boll. Romantic scenes are not 'Created' in Uwe's movies; they just happen. They happen without reason, without NEED for reason, like a rock dropped in a puddle, like a stinkbomb exploding in a bowl of jello. . .BOOM!

Will Jack be able to defeat an entire army? Uwe Boll is getting better as a director. \"Bloodrayne 2\" was good, \"Tunnel Rats\" was respectable, and now this... I liked it. The days of pure manure like \"Alone in the Dark\" and \"House of the Dead\" might finally be behind him. And it helps that he has a strong cast... Til Schweiger (\"SLC Punk\", \"Inglourious Basterds\") is a great action star as Jack Carver. Emmanuelle Vaugier is annoying, but able as reporter Valerie Cardinal. I fell in love with Natalia Avelon as military leader Katja Chernov, and want to see all her movies... too bad they're in German.B-movie hack (and I say that with respect) Michael Par\u00e9 is Paul Summers... and not to be missed, creepy German guy Udo Kier is Dr. Lucas Krieger! Because, you know, you can't have a good film without a mad German scientist. (There should have been some subplot of him being an ex-Nazi, but the mystery of his painting kept me intrigued well enough.) Chris Coppola shows up as Emilio the Food Guy. You might recall Coppola from other Boll films: \"BloodRayne II: Deliverance\" as Newton Piles and \"Postal\" as Richard. I wouldn't mind seeing him again... a little comic relief is important in an action film.Action, humor, sex... this is a good adaptation. And there are plenty of stunts (see the list of stunt men -- it's longer than the cast). Uwe Boll, you are beginning to pleasantly surprise me... bring on your \"Max Schmeling\" movie and bring on \"BloodRayne 3\".",

            "content": "It's definitely more than 3 when you want to relax. It's not serious movie thou, not even good action one - although the action is fine. I watched it after the game and I think the game has better story. :-) But I simply forgot about the game, watched the simple movie with some action and not exactly believable romance in it, and I was relaxed. Opening scene might be the best part as it looks like sci-fi stuff, but the rest is still OK. Acting is like the movie, probably the romance in the bed is the worst part (although I generally like bed scenes and I'm very forgiving there ;-)), some action parts are way too long (one chase with the mutant) but otherwise it's quite solid average movie based on a simple script without any great idea. The thing that is great about this movie is that it's generally quite smooth and it didn't make me angry like my last bad experience (Flight of the Phoenix http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377062/). No far-fetched scenes, no embarrassing dialogs (\"You better be here when I return\" :-)), no forced drama. Easy, smooth, flowing average action. There are better movies outside that made me rather unsatisfied because they looked more serious. This is NOT serious even if it's not a comedy. It's simply B class (or C?) action movie. Not a bad one. Probably the missing point is the worst problem - but hey, who would expect a point here?",

They're bland and uninteresting. We're given a lot of scenes that are supposed to act as comic relief, but they just physically hurt. The romance scene between our two lead actors is the most awkward thing in the movie by far.As for the acting, the two leads are passable, as is Udo Kier, but everyone else is so awful that you can hardly believe it.The story isn't great, either. The plot revolves around an island where creepy looking super soldiers are being developed. The \"Plot\", as it were, is quickly shelved to make way for endless scenes of soldiers shooting each other. I'm not against action-heavy movies. In fact, they can be quite fun when done properly. However, the action on display here is as bland and lifeless as the monsters. There are car chases, boat chases, explosions and endless bullets flying, but it's all so poorly executed and shot that it just numbs the senses and damn near put me to sleep.Honestly, it's hard to think of any redeeming values this film may possess. I can't recommend this movie, not under any circumstances.",

            "content": "I am deeply disturbed by some posts I am reading on the message boards for this movie, people saying it is actually a good movie! Just because this movie is Uwe Boll's best to date does not make it a good movie at all, no way in hell! Far Cry is a clich\u00e9d mess full of bad acting, poor direction, and an uninspired story with a shoddy script. This is Boll's first pure action movie, and news flash people, action movies aren't too hard to make because for a basic action flick all you need is explosions and gun battles scattered around a flimsy plot, and hey, Mr. Boll succeeds in doing that. House of the Dead, Alone in the Dark, and Bloodrayne, all horror games adapted into movies by Boll are far worse than this (they have no redeeming qualities). Far Cry boasts two things which make it his best yet: two good leads and a couple of well-done action sequences. Til Schweiger is quite good as Jack Carver, and Emmanuelle Vaugier is a strong female lead. The usually great Udo Kier is passable as the clich\u00e9d villain and the supporting cast are pretty damn bad. Towards the end of the film there is a surprisingly tense chase sequence which came as a shock considering Boll was behind the camera.Unfortunately the rest of the movie has an incredibly cheap feel to it, with bad CGI, lame one-liners and clich\u00e9s around every corner. Oh, and the worst lead up to a sex scene I think I have ever scene. Not only have the two only known each other for six hours, but all it takes is for him to say he kept warm while in the army by spooning his fellow soldiers. He already got her to take his clothes off by merely telling her to. Then he took his off and climbed into bed because he was afraid of hypothermia.Anyway, to summarise, this is a bad movie. It is mindless action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you are totally bored. One could probably do worse than popping this in and watching it, but I'd personally say watch a classic action film like Die Hard or Predator and stay away from this derivative mess.1\u00bd/5",

            "content": "O.K., here we go. First of all, I must say, I liked the game very well (I'm talking about the first game, the second installment is still on my to do list). So, I'm speaking of a first person shooter that really got me for days (yes, it took me a while, but I like to play a game on more difficult level). But this is about the movie.I've seen a lot of so called \"video game adaptations\". And I know that the name \"Uwe Boll\" makes a lot of people say: \"Oh my God, not another movie by this guy\". BUT: When I want to see a video game adaption, I always go to the movie with the lowest expectations. Like it was with \"Far Cry\". I thought, o.k., another movie about a video game I played, let's see what they made out of it. Well, I wasn't surprised, that the story deviated from the game, I wasn't surprised that they didn't have a lot of money for the special effects, but I saw the list of actors taking part in the movie, which was really surprising.For the movie, I must say, that it is a descent action movie and that it is - of course - on a low budget scale. That includes taking the setting away from a nice tropical environment and placing it into a more Canadian and cheaper setting. That also includes, that the storyline changed - who ever made a movie based on a first person shooter and based the story only on this person? - but in a reasonable scale. This also means, that some characters were invented (e.g. the big funny guy and the uncle, you will see, if you see the movie).What I liked about it was all about the game - they implemented the cars, the boat(s), the secret experiments stuff and the one guy that got there - uninvited. What I disliked about the movie: Well, it could have been a lot closer to the game. Why not making an opening according to the game? Let the one guy making the opening with his boat getting torn apart and leaving him in a situation, where he must find out for himself. Let him discover on his own, where he is and why all this sh** is going on around him.So, if you like cheap action movies - go for it! If you want a serious storyline with academy awards performances - avoid it. I liked the movie and I must admit, that although the storyline changed and it doesn't really feel like \"Far Cry - the game\", there was a lot of fun and action in it. Who else besides Uwe Boll dares to give us movies about our most favorite games?",

Jack is suddenly thrown back into battle, while trying to drop off a journalist on to a mysterious island. On the island Carver is faced with a mad German scientist who's genetically modifying people into mutant soldiers.Far Cry is very fun and quite an enjoyable movie, I can't imagine why anyone would rate this film anything less than a 5. Perhaps the low rating is due to people rating it without even actually watching it. In my opinion Uwe Boll has directed a great action film that doesn't take itself to seriously.

I know what you are thinking.I am crazy but seriously this film is a slight improvement on all of of his game-to-movie adaptations. However slight,an improvement is an improvement.The is about a retired special forces soldier Jack Carver(Til Schweiger) who now ferries people on his boat to the sea for sightseeing. However things take a turn for the worst when an aspiring journalist , Valerie Constantine(Emmanuelle Vaugier), decides to hire him to take her to Dr Krieger's(Udo Kier) island. Where he is testing reanimated soldiers to fight at his command. Of course they both are discovered and destruction and mayhem ensue.The story is of course not too great considering Uwe Boll's making it. There is always a bad thing and a good thing when it comes to a game-to-movie adaptation. In this case it is Far Cry's. First the bad. The convoluted plot is one of the bad points of this film. I mean what kind of government would allow the reanimation of soldiers. Of course again there is that clich\u00e9 where \"they say that they have everything under control but obviously they do not\" situation. And now the acting. Til schweiger actually does a decent job at being Jack Carver.Hhe could actually pass of as B-list action hero. However sometimes his accent gets in the way of him feeling like an action hero. And Emmanuelle Vaugier is not really up to her usual standard of acting, lacking any real emotion throughout he film. And the worst actor in this film was probably Chris Coppola. He played Emilio, a cook who is caught in between this whole mess. I am pretty sure he brought in to have some comic relief. But the sad thing is that he is just not funny at all. His jokes come in at all the wrong times. Courtesy of sloppy writing. I if you did not know, he was also in another Uwe Boll movie, Postal , in which he was not funny too. Although that was another good effort by Uwe. He is the kind of guy who tries to be funny but just isn't.And now the good part of the film. The ACTION !!!! Seriously this was probably the only saving grace in the entire film. The fight scenes were nicely choreographed and the shoot outs were pretty cool too. Even the beginning chase scene was well shot. If Uwe Boll has proved anything is that can direct a B-action movie properly if he wanted. He just has to take the initiative. Although he still has a long way more to go and has to improve a lot more if he want to be famous and not notorious for his directing",

He plays a video game, gets excited and loves it and then runs outside to his backyard and 'plays' Far Cry, or BloodRayne, or House of The Dead with his friends only add the fact that he is rich and films it. It's like watching a child imagine real life video games. Far Cry truly is the perfect recipe for an action film but a lot of video games are like that and few of them ever translate into a kick-butt action flick let alone be held back by B-Movie actors and a hack like Boll behind the scenes. The writers took the more lame elements of the video game to try and incorporate them into the script. The idea of the 'Predator' soldiers was far fetched in the game let alone to try and translate to film. While the idea of making them super human does look cool in some situations, it doesn't help. The script is just simply awful and while that aspect can't necessarily be attributed to Boll, he should know when he sees crap.Til Schweiger looks the part. The ripped muscled chiseled features of an action star that has a little Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Stathom, Sly Stallone all mixed into one with a dash of Dolph Lundgren and he might be a good actor but this role does nothing for him. He is a joke and looking the part doesn't even come close to carrying the movie. Emmanuelle Vaugier is a stunning beauty and I've seen her in CSI: NY and I know she's a decent actress. She does okay in this film given how craptastic the script is and I think her and Schweiger could have chemistry but nothing helps them get to that point. She is fantastically hot though. If you were looking to cast an evil German scientist with a B-Movie spin Udo Kier would be the only choice. He is the ultimate looking villain and could have been good possibly if once again the script is crap. He is an utter joke as the lead villain. In my opinion there is literally one redeemable character and performance in the film. Ralf Moeller (think of him as a low budget Schwarzenegger) is a powerhouse of a figure and does a great job playing the quiet security guard who is transformed into a monstrous predator. His battles are the coolest, he looks the coolest and he is the best character in the film. Maybe its just a lucky shot by Moeller or maybe they happened to write him better but he is the only redeemable character.I think I trashed Uwe Boll enough to get the point across that he will ruin almost any video game and keep doing it with money, hence three Bloodrayne films, and a new Dungeon Siege sequel on the way. Lets look at the trilogy of terror that is the writing team for Far Cry. Michael Roesch, Peter Scheerer, Masaji Takei are literally Uwe Boll flunkies. They have written or worked on almost all of his crappiest films so I guess you can only expect so much. No matter what I say the team will continue making films and likely about video games so hopefully they don't get any more good licenses. Until then I will keep sitting through them hoping they finally translate something redeemable. 3/10",

Naturally, a lot of reviews reflect that.Most of the criticism is unjustified, however. I have yet to see a movie adaptation of a video game that can faithfully reproduce the atmosphere of the game, and how could they? In a VG, you are an active participant, with your imagination contributing to the story. In a movie, the director can only present his own interpretation, and that will seem unsatisfactory to many fans of the game.Given this restriction, Uwe Boll has done a fairly good job. He did not fall into the trap of trying to copy the VG scene by scene. Instead, he produced a movie that used the available funds and actors to best advantage. Especially Udo Kier as Dr Krieger was an excellent choice. All in all this may not be a first-rate movie, but can surely hold its own with many another production of this genre.",

The two leads work well together and have some on screen chemistry.I don't know anything about the game this is based off and don't care. What does concern me is the quality of the movie, which was excellent. Its nice to see a movie where the characters are interacting with each other instead of spitting lame lines at one another.One more thing, the lead female (Emmanuelle Vaugier), its refreshing to see a hottie that can actually act for change, good job. And Til Schweiger pulls off the gruff action hero role flawlessly.Just check this movie out, it's a great lazy Saturday afternoon flick, you wont regret it.

So I am a little less biased than some others.After the first five minutes I expected a dumb predictable action flick based on a lot of explosions and tough characters. And the plot is lame and stereotypal.1) Dr. Krieger is a reincarnation of Mengele. He has created genetically modificated brainless Super Soldiers. 2) He has a sadistic Russian assistant. The Iron Curtain may have raised, but those ex-commies are never to be trusted, are they? 3) Our herion is an ambitious young reporter, who always Knows What the Right Thing Is To Do. 4) Our hero is an alcoholic ex Special Force, who gets involved against his will.Still after some 20 minutes I was intrigued; I had a few laughs. When Mr. Food Guy was introduced I really began to enjoy myself. Far Cry contains a hilarious escape scene. When the mutants were loose my girlfriend, with whom I watched, as so often asked the crucial question: Who is fighting against who?Exactly. That scene is total chaos. It is reminiscent of the classical tart throwing scenes of slapstick; in fact it is a modern update. My favourite part is when one of the mutants starts pulling the chain on which Jack is hanging.In my opinion Far Cry is a comedy, a spoof if you prefer, and not a bad one. Even in its worst scenes, at the beginning, it does not take itself seriously at all. I refer to the waking Jack up scene by shooting a bell with a rifle. The main flaw of Far Cry is that it doesn't have enough silly jokes in the first 20 minutes, busy as it is with getting into the story.",

            "content": "Germany's most notorious director, Dr. Uwe Boll, has stricken again and just unleashed his next action-packed adaptation of a popular video game, namely Ubisoft's best selling ego shooter \"Far Cry\". And, of course, a lot of self proclaimed preservers of good taste will now scream bloody murder once again and ask themselves the same old questions, namely why in god's name is the \"Ed Wood of the 21. century\" still allowed to make movies after all the atrocities he committed in the past and why couldn't he have chosen a game that's at least a little less popular and well respected than the legendary \"Far Cry\".I, however, have stopped to listen to the complaints of the naysayers long ago, cause not only have I more or less enjoyed almost all films that Boll directed since his infamous first video game adaptation \"House Of The Dead\" in 2003, but also do I believe that even those flicks, which I personally do not hold in the highest esteem, like \"Alone In The Dark\" or \"Bloodrayne II: Deliverance\", are still quite a bit better than the bashers say they are.Anyway. As a fan of most of the eccentric director's work, I personally couldn't wait for his new action smasher \"Far Cry\" to hit the silver screens here in Germany on October 2nd, 2008. Of course I went to see it on the opening day and when me and my pals arrived at the cinema for the midnight screening of \"Far Cry\", we opened a bottle of beer right away and prepared ourselves for a little more than 90 action-packed minutes full of explosions, car chases, gun fights, punch-ups, stunts and even more explosions.And, you gotta believe me, \"Far Cry\" did indeed live up to all of my expectations. It's of course not up there with the big summer blockbusters like \"The Dark Knight\" or \"Iron Man\", but it's nevertheless a helluva lot of fun from start to finish. If you're lookin' for a fast-paced, tongue-in-the-cheek no-brainer in the tradition of vintage b-movie classics such as Van Damme's \"Universal Soldier\", Chuck Norris' \"Invasion USA\" or Arnie's \"Commando\", \"Far Cry\" is definitely the right film for you to watch.If the cuts had been a bit slower during the action sequences and if the camera had been a bit less shaky during the fight scenes, I would almost have believed that I'm watching a cheesy cult flick from the past and not a movie that's been shot in 2007. Except for a few minor reservations, Uwe Boll has indeed succeeded in combining the special charm of the action flicks of the 80s with modern techniques, spectacular effects and an up-to-date look.Sure, just like the afore-mentioned classics, \"Far Cry\" does also not really have a profound story, deep characters and clever dialogues, but then again, I really doubt that anyone in his right mind would expect a campy flick like this to come up with any of these things. If you're going to watch \"Far Cry\" in cinema or rent it on DVD, you wanna see lots and lots of stunts, fights and explosions and the film does certainly not fall short on any of 'em.You get a see spectacular pursuits by car, speedboat and foot as well as lots of jeeps and helicopters being blown to pieces, soldiers being beaten up or shot to death and tons of other cool effects and stunts. When the former elite soldier Jack Carver (Til Schweiger) and the ambitious reporter Valerie Cardinal (Emmanuelle Vaugier) set foot on a secluded island where the mad scientist Dr. Krieger (Udo Kier) is working on the creation of an army of genetically engineered super-soldiers, all hell breaks loose and bullets and fists are about to cut the air at minute intervals.In Dr. Krieger's secret labs the laws of physics and gravity seem to be no longer valid and hence we get to see a lot of cool and totally over-the-top action sequences that make us laugh and giggle almost as much as the corny dialogues and (unintentionally) funny incidents (you have to see the hilarious build-up to Jack's and Valerie's love scene, for example).The only things I didn't really like about \"Far Cry\", apart from the afore-mentioned fast cuts and shaky camera work during the fight scenes, are the fact that throughout the whole movie hardly any blood squirts out of the wounds when people get shot and the annoying character of Chris Coppola. He plays the sniveling cook Emilio, who's unfunny jokes and constant complaints about his hurting back make him quite a pain in the ass whenever he is on screen.But these are only minor points of criticism and all in all I really enjoyed \"Far Cry\" for it's over-the-top action sequences, vintage b-movie charm and tongue-in-the-cheek humor. Neither the film itself nor the stars, like Til Schweiger and Udo Kier who both deliver really cool performances, take themselves too seriously \u0097- a point that really adds to the overall enjoyment of the flick.To cut a long story short, I'd finally like to recommend Uwe Boll's \"Far Cry\" to all those of you who are still into the old action hits of the past. If you still enjoy your vintage tapes of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Michael Dudikoff & Co every once in a while, there's a good chance you might enjoy \"Far Cry\" quite a bit as well. Check it out and give it a fair chance... it's really a kick ass movie from start to finish and a helluva lot of fun to watch!!",

Not only that but the acting and action sequences are so corny it almost makes you feel like the whole project was one big joke.

An okay cast headed by the excellent Udo Keir is cast adrift by Boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked. The mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked, additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness, however Boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way. Its as if he couldn't be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead rattled off stock camera placements and walked away. Additionally the assembly of scenes has no spark or life, I'm guessing that Boll only shot one or two takes and just used what he had. It really stinks. Clearly Boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films where anything he's ever learned about film gets flushed. The last film he made that was this bad was Seed a serial killer movie that is one of the worst films I've ever seen. This isn't that bad, but it is close simply because it should have been better. Then again Udo Keir is good enough that he does make watching his scenes worth the effort and make this a an almost so bad its good film.

(We have no Idea why would government do that).Max Cardinal comes into contact with some sensitive information regarding to the operation which proves that the experimentation is illegal, so he contact his cousin Valerie cardinal(Who is a press reporter). So Valerie goes on a mission to search this unknown Island and his missing uncle Max. Valerie hires a boat and (the HERO enters the scene), Jack craver who happens to be MAX best butt buddies in the Army special force way back in time and the Mission starts, Things didn't turn out the way it should have been and now the girl and the boy are chased by entire Island security force. (Crappy background Music)Cheap thrills, Medium quality Action scenes and a semi-hot bed scene and some more Crappy music.Turns out that uncle MAX has been turned into a Super soldier who is now under the possession of the Weird scientist and has been activated to kill his Cousin & his best buddy. But the real human emotion in MAX has been activated by some code word used by JACK, which symbolizes something from the past when they were in special forces (Probably an erection technique). MAX(the super soldier)is now against the Scientist and will save his Cousin & Buddy. Mayhem starts, every soldier is foot loose and is on killing everyone who comes along his way. But some how Valerie and Jack are off the Island in a boat which comes to rescue by a Food guy(Comic relief) & the scientist is left alone on the Island to take the taste of his own medicine. (Crappy Music again). Happy ending. Valerie got her covers news, Jack got a new boat on which the Food guy makes hot delicious meat and we are left to decide Uhhhhh.The movie is not to bad, Tim voice sucks no wonder why German kicked him out. The actor played the role of scientist looks likes he is taking some kind of Drug. There is a food guy, which gives us a comic relief(Beside the fact that the movie itself is a big spoof of Itself) My Rating : 5/10",

            "content": "Uwe Boll is an altogether fascinating human being and, well, someone has to watch his movies, right? If you don't know nothing yet, just cherry pick a decent video about him on YouTube, and marvel at the troll. Widely known as the world's worst movie director (Although I would give the title to Ulli Lommel or David DeCoteau), Boll has made a myriad of movies, from which I have seen the decent examples , like \"Rampage\" trilogy and \"Assault on Wall Street\". Very exploitative but contained and fun movies. Then some 4's in form of \"Postal\" and \"Tunnel Rats\", so I figured it's time for a few of his most infamous game adaptations. Being a Far Cry franchise fan, it wasn't a tough first choice.It has now been about 10-15 years since I played and even finished first of the \"Far Cry\" games, and the memories are only made up from pictures, so I won't be able to compare the two. To a big stretch, the game seemed respected. We all know how it is to shoot some barrels while driving so the car chasing you crashes. The plot goes like this: An ex-special forces soldier turned boatman, Jack Carver, or Til Schweiger, is hired as a transport by a journalist who's about to investigate a top-secret military base on a nearby island. On this island, the cuckoo scientist Lucas Krieger (Udo Kier) is making advanced zombie soldiers. That's the entire plot, and you know who, when and how will 'ride off into the sunset'.Okay, so, \"Far Cry\" is an enormous mess of epic proportions. It features a variety of bad stylistic choices, overdrawn scenes, very pushed-in comedy in big amounts, prolonged scenes, uncut frames, subpar lighting, subpar make-up, sub-par cgi, sub-par action sequences, lots of cheese, no tension, nothing is at stake, it's highly predictable and the comedy relief character of Emilio grew to annoy me greatly. Comedy is consistent in a bothersome way, and most of the jokes are tepid. Schweiger, as much as I like him, seems a little miscast, which I can't say about Udo Kier who's familiar with crazy scientist roles, and still, some of the dialogue given to him is on-the-nose artificial. Lots of the action takes place during daytime, not a very good decision, ain't no Ari Aster and his daylight phenomena Midsommar. Atmosphere here is null. Locations are boring, the island is not taken advantage of, and scenery-wise \"Far Cry\" is a lackluster. Boll's often been about what's loud, bangs and explodes, and it shows. Cinematography is inconsistent and doesn't help in a portion of fight scenes. Gore hounds, beware, there's little bloody action. I truly was expecting more. Taking all this into account, the most scary is the fact that \"Far Cry\" is budgeted at 30 million dollars. This and that about how he got the budgets can also be found out, if you go on Uwe Boll history lesson.Nonetheless, \"Far Cry\" was more fun than the previous week's \"FearDotCom\", but I can't in good spirits recommend \"Far Cry\" to anyone really, for it didn't manage to be so bad that it's good. Boll's still crazy though. My rating: 3/10",

            "content": "A mediocre game turns into a bad movie\u0085 thanks to who? Ah, the great and immensely wonderful Uwe Boll takes yet another video game and turns it into the motion picture. It's bad enough that the game itself (in my opinion) could be a lot better, but the making of the film (by Boll) was a freaking sacrilege. Boll as usual just took the game, re-wrote the plot and then squeezed out of his butt on the big screen. It has that mad scientist on the Island thing, like in the game, but in the game the plot is settled somewhere on uncharted island in Micronesia, let's just say somewhere on Pacific. While in the film, it took place somewhere\u0085 in Canada? In some country on the north of US? Who knows? The looks of the filming locations are unlikely to have a large island with giant military operation. It just doesn't fit. The only thing that is same just like in the game, is that we have heroes Jack Carver and reporter Valerie who hires Carver to find her uncle, while in the game she just looks for the island to find out what is going on there. With the help of a man named Doyle. And, Doyle is not here\u0085 There is a mad scientist, there are his monstrous creations\u0085 but with the help of Boll, they look more messed up. I think that the game would ask for more budget. Curiously, I think that Boll didn't have enough. That's weird. While his movie funding remains a mystery\u0085Carver is played by Till Schweiger, whose career could have been instantly killed after this. He was kind of likable, but his character was so bad, that I just had a hard time to see\u0085 what kind of special, super solider he is. He was just badly written. Valerie is played by Emmanuelle Vaugier, whose career could also have consequences after this. She was nothing that special. In the game, she only appeared by voice, but here, they decided to put her as Carver's love interest, and without any emotion and any of the chemistry. The mad scientist, Dr. Krieger is played by Udo Kier. A fine actor, but he made so much bad movies. Why does he need to pile it up more? Even with this? I don't understand. Why would such a good actor waste his talents on such a bad film and such a bad director. Ralf Moller appears in this film as Valerie's uncle Max. Max was basically pointless. He did not appear in the game, he was put in the film only because Moller is a 6'6\" behemoth of a man, who can easily play these super human soldiers. There was just nothing that this character gives to us. And you just can't tell that he is Valerie's uncle. You just can't. There is no connection of any kind. The actors as Michael Pare and Clint Howard are also here. Yeah, the two extremely washed up actors who constantly seeks refuge in Boll films. What the hell? Both are solid actors, not the best, but solid. And by keep appearing in Boll's films are just killing their career more and more. Craig Fairbrass was used because of his soldier like menacing looks, but this can guy can do more than that. He should just avoid Boll. And, sad to say, Chris Coppola, who was the most irritating character in the film, one of the worst performances ever. I know that he is supposed to be irritating and boring character. But his character was so dull written, that Coppola didn't even, probably knew how to perform it, and I think that he was far more confused by Boll's bad directing. The action scenes, camera work, score, editing\u0085 they are nothing special. The worst stuff was specified above. Avoid this film. It will ruin your mind. Better stick to the video game.",

I had heard some chat and warnings on the net ,but that something could be so bad ,I really did not , we , the innocent flock of viewers ,DID NOT deserve ! This is on par with Slovenian so-called movies and TV comedy series that our self-proclaimed national TV station is force - feeding its innocent and especially gullible citizens to withstand and even positively support ( God and Gods ,forgive them NOT ! ) ! I wouldn't let the Bolldude flip burgers in a prison with cross-dressers or clean the flip-flops ,so incompetent and miserable he is ( I hope he doesn't drive ,if yes ,please warn me in advance of his whereabouts !) .And the reason for this outrage , ah, the film : some Aryan dude ,who is a sailor \u2013contractor , one day takes on board some semi-good looking red-haired bimbo journalist-she opposes being called a reporter , mind you !- chick to transport her to some island that is off limits for the public as there she is supposed to meet her uncle Max ,who has meanwhile already been transformed into some genetically improved humanoid super warrior , and , you 've got to see these poor 'monsters' , namely , they are all dead white and , they are impervious to any bullet unless hit in the eyes or mouth,so ,naturally they don't utter a squeak, but they are killed and\u0085 I can't take it no more !And the crown achievement , the aforementioned couple supposedly has sex ,and then he keeps asking her how good he was !Flaming thunderbolts !

            "content": "So, I've played the original game and the film contains a modicum of similarity. It's a shame it's on such a small budget but I have to say, I enjoyed it. I could well have imagined Jason Statham playing Jack in a big budget adaptation. And Jon Lovitz as the food guy. I watched the film because at 95 minutes long, well 85 excluding credits, it felt like a punt to pass just over an hour. And I don't regret it. In fact I'd watch it again. The story that said is hampered by the runtime. There's little time to develop any characters. Jack gets a little obsessed about his 2/10 rating by Valerie, where a more secure character would have merely said \"hey, it's a start\". Craig Fairbrass is a face from the past, and a welcome one at that for me. He was watchable and a source of entertainment for a secondary character. His best henchman role is in Cliff Hanger but he does a decent job I'm Far Cry. Watch it when everyone has gone to bed because they'll think it's rubbish unless they find themselves curiously addicted.",

            "content": "I'm just wondering what Boll's ideas were, when thinking of turning this mile stone video game into a film. If you do a film based on Far Cry, called Far Cry, I expect Far Cry! That is so simple. I want brilliant characters, great action, astonishing location with bright exotic colors, tropical islands, emerald palm forests, crystal clear water, white sand, shipwrecks, concrete ruins, abandoned labs, huge satellite dishes to be blown up, tons of enemies and of course monster soldiers. In this film there is LITTLE or NOTHING of all this. Not even the haunting trademark bell sound or the amazing musical atmosphere! Maybe the Hawaiian shirt is the only recognizable element of that masterwork of FPS game. Boll is disappointing openly every single Far Cry fan. It doesn't deserve the title FAR CRY. The same happened with DOOM! A shame! It makes me CRY out loud!! I wonder why some Hollywood studio does't take the chance and create a real well made video game adaption! Probably they are still busy with graphic novel adaptations!",

Even though this movie is predictable, it's worth watching. I saw it for free so wasn't trying to get my money's worth. Is it a little campy? Yes, on purpose. The main actor doesn't have a bunch of lines but this is an action movie so not too much to say. The added comic relief character actually was kind of funny. If don't take this film seriously and just enjoy the ride, it's worth your time to kick back and enjoy an 80's style cookbook action film.",

After all far cry was good game adaptation with some powerful action scenes If you want to see ridiculous film and already play far cry games,this movie is one of best. 3/10 very low vote.Far cry deserves much more.

            "content": "Unlike early Uwe Boll movies such as Bloodrayne, Alone in the Dark, and House of the Dead, Far Cry isn't actually a horrible movie. It's just a below average one. The movie has a slow pace, the romance is completely clich\u00e9, and it horribly abuses logic but when you look back from watching this movie you realize that as a whole it wasn't a total waste of your time. It's one of those movies that you watch on TV because nothing else is on and you have nothing better to do. If you find yourself engaged in this movie and are applying even slight common sense though then you could probably point out about ten plot holes or character inconsistencies within the first five minutes. I was actually surprised by this movie because I figured that it was going to be far worse then it was. But if Boll continues on this path he might one day actually make a good movie.",

            "content": "So im not a big fan of Boll's work but then again not many are. I enjoyed his movie Postal (maybe im the only one). Boll apparently bought the rights to use Far Cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. People who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not Far Cry... This is something Mr Boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. Feeling loneley on the set Mr Boll invites three of his countrymen to play with. These players go by the names of Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller.Three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz. So the tale goes like this, Jack Carver played by Til Schweiger (yes Carver is German all hail the bratwurst eating dudes!!) However I find that Tils acting in this movie is pretty badass.. People have complained about how he's not really staying true to the whole Carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don't really know what he looked like when he was kicking a**.. However, the storyline in this film is beyond demented. We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger played by Udo Kier, making Genetically-Mutated-soldiers or GMS as they are called. Performing his top-secret research on an island that reminds me of \"SPOILER\" Vancouver for some reason. Thats right no palm trees here. Instead we got some nice rich lumberjack-woods. We haven't even gone FAR before I started to CRY (mehehe) I cannot go on any more.. If you wanna stay true to Bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true Boll experience, meaning most of it will suck.There are some things worth mentioning that would imply that Boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes. Until the whole cromed/albino GMS squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh.. The movie Far Cry reeks of scheisse (that's poop for you simpletons) from a fa,r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead.. BTW Carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he's on screen.",

I've seen much worse acting, worse effects and sets, and worse action sequences.I've neither played the game, nor watched any of Boll's other movies, so although my expectations weren't terribly high, I wasn't offended by the film's take on the game (as I had no comparison) nor was I predisposed to hate it because of the director (never heard of him).Unlike certain other movies (I'm thinking the execrable \"Click\", for example), if I'd watched this in a cinema I probably wouldn't actually have walked out.Unexciting but not offensively bad.
