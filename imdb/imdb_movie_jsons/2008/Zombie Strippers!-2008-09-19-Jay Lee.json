            "content": "It's hard to knock a movie like \"Zombie Strippers\" because it's fully aware of how audaciously stupid and ridiculous it is. It doesn't matter that it isn't high satire or even reasonably solid on a technical level because when it comes down to it, some guy sat down one day and decided to make a movie that combined two of the average drunk male's favorite things- zombies and strippers, and \"Zombie Strippers\" doesn't just contain zombies and stripping (actual stripping included, by the way), it goes as far as fulfilling its title and providing a horde of surprisingly sexy... you guessed it, zombie strippers.Commenting on the quality of the direction or the quality of the script with a movie like this just isn't worth it. This movie isn't the worst ever made (that's a fact, sorry), but it is a pretty terrible movie anyway. Could this movie have actually been funny for its jokes? I don't know. Could this ever have been a quality project in the first place? \"Zombie Strippers\" is a movie about zombie strippers. By nature it is going to be pretty darn stupid and pretty darn bad. Using this criteria, \"Zombie Strippers\" is nowhere near as awful as it could have been. I even chuckled a couple of times. The girls all look good too, Jameson being the least attractive, and to think she was the object of every North American man's desire in the 90's (don't go near plastic surgery, girls). This movie does exactly what it says on the tin, and that deserves some level of respect. Oh, the audacity.3/10 as a movie, but I can't say it wasn't fun on some level.",

            "content": "In a near future, President George Bush has been just elected for the fourth time with his vice Arnold Schwarzenegger and the USA is in war against many nations, among them Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Venezuela, France and Alaska. In order to compensate the loss of soldiers, the government is researching a virus to reanimate the dead tissue of deceased soldiers and reactivate their brains, to form a powerful army of undead. When the experiment goes wrong and gets out of control in a facility in Sartre, Nebraska, the efficient Z Squad is summoned to destroy the zombies. However, the soldier Byrdflough (Zak Kilberg) is bitten by a zombie and afraid of being killed, he escapes to the underground Brademus strip-club owned by the greedy Ianna Esco (Robert Englund). Byrdflough bites the star Kat (Jenna Jameson) and the stripper spreads the virus, turning her colleagues into zombies and eating the flesh of their clients.I am a big fan of zombie movies, and \"Zombie Strippers!\" is an underrated B-movie with potential of cult-movie. The predictable story is very similar to \"Planet Terror\" and other movies of zombies, i.e., a military experiment that accidentally releases a deadly virus that transforms people into zombies, but the joke in the beginning with President Bush is unique. Further, there are many sexy strippers, black humor, hilarious lines and situations and great special effects and Gothic music score, and this gore film is very entertaining. I am not familiar with adult movies, but the sexy Jenna Jameson is a porn-star from this industry. Jennifer Holland is also extremely gorgeous and sexy and I liked this movie a lot. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"As Strippers Zumbis\" (\"The Zombie Strippers\")Note: On 20 February 2016, I saw this film again.Note: On 29 September 2020, I saw this film again.",

            "content": "I was once a big fan of zombie movies, but then I caught a number of the barrage of 'low budget' zombie flicks and quickly lost interest in the genre. It's not that the zombie film doesn't work well with a low budget; the main problem was that a lot of them work from the same idea and it gets boring quickly. It seems, however, that certain filmmakers have noticed the problem and modern films such as Zombie Honeymoon and this one have decided to deliver something a bit different - and while still silly, the result is much better than 'just another' low budget zombie flick! The plot supposedly takes inspiration from a French play called 'Rhinoceros' (referenced by the strip club, called \"Rhino\") and focuses on a group of strippers. As the Bush Administration enters its fourth term, America has found itself looking for a way to make its soldiers last longer to help the war effort on multiple fronts. The solution comes in the form of a virus that brings the dead back to life. When the virus infects a stripper at the club, sleazy owner Ian (Robert Englund) realises the girl's new potential and puts her back on stage. After whipping the crowd into a frenzy; the rest of the girls find themselves with a choice to make. Do they stay human and stay second best to the zombie stripper\u0085or do they conform to the latest 'fad'? There's no denying that Zombie Strippers is a silly low budget zombie film, but perversely it would seem that the filmmakers actually wanted to make something of it; and we also get a muddled social satire along with a commentary on conformity. I have to admit that none of this really comes through in any sort of meaningful way, but you have to give a low budget zombie movie with a porn star in the lead role credit for trying! The thing I liked most about this movie is undoubtedly the club where most of the action takes place. Director Jay Lee creates a dark and seedy atmosphere which really benefits the tone of the film and makes for a great backdrop for the girls' strip dances! The leading lady is the lovely Miss Jenna Jameson. I can't say I've ever seen anything else with her in it, and while she's not really my 'type', she certainly knows how to put on a performance - her introduction and first dance as a zombie are the highlights of the film. The movie also features the talent of the lovely Roxy Saint; both in the acting and music department. The soundtrack for the film really is awesome too and helps to enhance the sleazed qualities of the movie; 'Salute You' by Roxy Saint is a memorable track. The film doesn't hold back in the gore department either, which is nice. The film is already pretty silly from the beginning and it just gets sillier as it goes along. At times I felt things were getting just a bit too silly, but after a while you realise that it's easier just to sit back and go along with it. Zombie Strippers is a long way from being a masterpiece; but I'm sure that this film will find it's audience and anyone that enjoys this sort of stuff will have a blast with Zombie Strippers!",

            "review_title": "Zombie Strippers",
            "content": "In the near future(..during George W Bush's *fourth* Presidential term!),a commando unit(..the Z Squad)are called upon by governmental scientists to eradicate a compound riddled with zombies thanks in part to the release of a chemo-virus..this virus was designed to reanimate soldiers for combat against the enemy. One of the unit is bitten, escapes from the compound in fear that he will be shot, and finds himself in an illegal strip joint. Biting the *star* stripper, Kat(porn star Jenna Jameson), he is put away in the basement at the insistence of lecherous scheming germaphobe, Ian(Robert Englund, having the time of his life) who runs the illegal stripper establishment. Ian realizes potential when Kat, who, now a zombie, seems to be an even better stripper dead than alive, as the response by those in attendance is overwhelmingly positive. Seeing dollar signs as lusty males seeking a new brand of entertainment are entering with green to throw around, Ian will allow Kat to continue working even though she craves human flesh and often eats her lap-dance-clients! Soon other strippers are profoundly interested in experiencing what Kat has..becoming a zombie so that they can achieve the level of popularity and admiration showered upon her. It seems that, once bitten and turned into a zombie, the strippers seem more willing to satisfy their audience, athletically superior(..the way they take to the pole displays their new found ability)than ever before, and go for broke on the stage, uninhibited and free without restraint, not holding back..and, in turn, winning the adulation of males only more than willing to go back stage with them not knowing that they are to be on the zombie menu. Meanwhile, the Z squad are on the look-out for the member who got away, soon to find their way into the stripper club. At first, Ian is able to contain those bitten by the zombie strippers, using his hired help to imprison them in a cell in the basement, only to lose control once they are freed after a series of unforeseen circumstances.Well, if you are looking for zombie carnage, gory flesh-ripping, CGI heads exploding, strippers swinging the pole as the male audience, eyes bulging, cheer in unison with dollar bills raining on the stage, then this will more than satisfy. The film features Englund easily walking away with the movie, with Jameson perfectly cast(..not sure this is a compliment, though)as the star stripper(..I like how the door to her isolated dressing area has a star written in crayon to establish her as the headlining girl of the club). As the film progresses, the zombie strippers' flesh slowly rot, their eyes an eerie black, as they continue performing admirably for the crowd. Features some stunning gore, like a face ripped apart at the mouth and a head pried apart, the skull forced open revealing the brain as the zombie eats away. A very funny sequence features a victim, turned into a zombie, attempting to bite with his lower jaw hanging and tongue sticking out, wagging. There are backstage dramas/comedy featuring the variety of strippers, in constant competition/conflict with each other, and their response to Kat's emergence as a greater threat when the customers embrace her new persona on stage.A sub-plot concerns farm-girl Jessy(Jennifer Holland), needing cash to help her grandmother(Nana), during a crisis of faith, questioning life having been brought up in a Christian environment, and how her decision to possibly perform affects boyfriend Davis(John Hawkes)and fellow melancholy stripper, Bereng\u00e9(Jeannette Sousa)who often finds her peers annoying and trivial, rolling her eyes and scoffing at their behavior. Carmit Levit\u00e9 is Ian's trusty aid, Madame Blavatski, often providing ideas that he can utilize to make a profit, a foreigner often waxing nostalgia over memories of her homeland. Asante Jones is Terrence, Ian's MC who also helps him store away victims, rather reluctantly. Joey Medina is janitor, Paco, his Latin ethnicity used as a constant running gag(\"Badgers!We don't need no stinking badgers!\"). Shamron Moore is Kat's arch nemesis, Jeannie, striving to achieve top-level status as the very best stripper of the club, and often failing despite going the distance for her audience(..who are now transfixed with the new wave of zombie-stripping). While many will flock to see this because of Jameson who gets top billing, I thought Roxy Saint, as the raven-haired goth Lilith(..who secretly admires Kat)was quite a babe as well, emerging as a possible future horror star in the making. While I really enjoyed the practical gore effects, the CGI splatter where heads explode, when machine guns are used, less impressed me. Some nasty flesh devouring delivers the bloody goods. I wasn't particularly fond of the ridiculous, over-the-top supernatural abilities that take precedence over the story as Kat and Jeannie compete(..swinging around the poll with extra speed as if a fireman on his way to a burning building and popping pool balls from the vagina as if a sling-shot device to harm!)with each other as zombies tear away at customers in the balls-out finale while the Z Squad raid the joint, prepared to alleviate the world of an infestation out of control.",

I can go through the gambit: horrible, detestable, loathsome, revolting, abominable, inconceivable, no word exists in the English language that can accurately describe such a war crime against cinema. And I came in with no expectations. No positive ones at least. I don't know how the movie did it but it didn't even meet my exceedingly low expectations. If this movie was a food it be lutefisk with a side of brussel sprouts, if it were a real person it'd be Hitler and Stalin's love child, if it were a depth in the ocean only James Cameron would have seen it. This movie's complete polar opposite is the cure for cancer.But I digress, let me give you a description: After a crack team of soldiers kills a laboratory full of zombies, one manages to escape. He stumbles into a strip club and infects the ladies who develop an unquenchable bloodlust...and the need to strip. Realizing that his clientele have a ludicrous attraction to bloodied and decomposing body parts, the club owner (Robert Englund) decides to keep them around seemingly unaware of the problems they'll likely cause. I kid you not that's the plot.Co-starring Jenna Jameson and a hodge-podge of who cares, this movie fails on all levels. Now by this point some of you may be saying \"awesome, this movie sounds like its so bad its good!\" Let me be clear; there is so bad its good, so bad its bad, 12 feet of raw sewage and then this. I would not recommend this to my worst enemies and I absolutely do not recommend it to you. This is Ark of the Covenant type stuff; avoid with prejudice.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",

Sometimes those movies are outright hilarious. Unfortunately I was wrong. Dead wrong. This is far, far worse than that. In fact, contrary to what I expected, this may in fact be the worst movie I have seen. Ever. And I have seen some really bad ones.This one actually started out being really bad and rather boring.

            "content": "This is poorly made in most respects, and that's part of its appeal. In fact, I liked it. It has more jokes, and better jokes than any of the parody movies I've seen in years. Here's the setup. W Bush has stolen a fourth term and declared war on a dozen countries, including France. So many soldiers are getting killed that labs have invented a virus that reanimates them so that they can keep on fighting, and harder. This virus gets into a stripper establishment with the result that the strippers once infected get \"better,\" or at least more popular with the goofs.Sounds like it could be a mess, and it is. I think of it as some sort of triangulation among Tarantino's fake sleaze \"Death Proof,\" but more genuine, \"10,000 Corpses\" but with something other than snarls and \"Shaun of the Dead\" but with more clever jokes.The interesting thing is that there are breasts here. But they are part of the irony, the big joke. They are deliberately depicted to be as artificially defective as the zombie countenance. In fact, the folding here is that we have an on-screen audience of male louts who reward the zombie strippers above the \"regular\" girls, so they willingly become zombies to be sexier.The jokes range from cinematic jokes to comments on social issues, and they are at a higher level than usual.One of the strippers is a former Playmate and that's supposed to be some sort of draw.

            "content": "A movie such as this is always a toss up. One is certainly given enough information from the title about what to expect, and as such the result can be utter crap, or a devilishly guilt ridden B movie indulgence. I will leave my personal classification open to interpretation based upon the rest of this critique.B movies are a quirky little niche of the movie industry, slipping past the radar and existing as poor in many aspects of traditional film-making standards, yet somehow rising to the occasion to please grinning audiences. Sometimes a movie is intended to be a B, and sometimes it happens by accident; usually in the hands of an amateur and underfunded auteur. Regardless of how a movie like Zombie strippers came to be (even though it is fairly apparent in this case) the polished result, and I use that term loosely, can be perceived in three ways. The first, is a movie that is the bonafide gold standard of schlock, the second is one that has a burning admiration for this genre and directs an homage as a salute. The final and obnoxiously common result is a film that tries desperately to exist as a B movie, but fails on every level and unfortunately, Zombie Strippers is a direct offspring of the latter.I have stated before that I am a sucker for zombie films, but I have no such admiration for this picture; this zombie film just sucks. 2008 as a whole has shown a weak display of this genre, the best being the disappointing Diary of the Dead by legend George A. Romero. Also more notable is the more successful B movie, the Romero remake, Day of the Dead. Perhaps the largest flaw of Zombie Strippers (I assure you, there are a number) is the decision to forfeit most elements of the classic \"zombie\" picture. This lack of tradition is even more clear, due to the fact that it is supposed to be traditional; a homage; a throwback. I won't disclose exactly how it fails to meet these expectations, with fear of disclosing the \"plot\". Other issues range from the sometimes intolerable script which only occasionally descends into something gleefully tacky, the acting, while not vital to a picture of this calibre needs to be watchable, and pacing. Forgoing all else, this garbage unfolds at a snails pace (make that a crippled snail), mostly consisting of random and supposedly politically satirical humour and extended strip scenes, which lose their appeal quickly when the go-go's start to go-bad. There is some well done gore for the budget, but it is most certainly not worth your time.Called to a chemical lab, a group of elite soldiers are shocked to discover the result of a government re-animation program; zombies. Dispatching of the threat, the virus escapes into a nearby strip-club, run by the devilish Robert Englund of Nightmare on Elm St. fame, who I am sure was full after filming, from all the scenery he had been chewing on. Among the sultry strippers is Kat, played by Jenna Jameson, whose boyfriend Jay Lee directed. The virus affects men and women differently, leaving only women with their pre-existing mental capacity, but tacking on a degrading demeanour and hunger for flesh. The catch, it appears in death that these women can strip up a storm, and soon, despite pushing a few bodies under the rug, business is booming. All is perfect for Ian (Englund) and his group of co-workers and friends, until the gals get a tad antsy and things get out of control.Despite the possibly good intentions, Zombie Strippers is simply dreck; an overlong and ploddingly paced humourless mess and your money would be better spent on Romero's latest venture, or renting last years Grindhouse. In Zombie Strippers, the only memorable thing stripping away is your patience and the dignity of those involved.",

Zombie Strippers is further proof that trash cinema has clawed its way back to the surface and is now, once again, well and truly alive. And I, for one, couldn't be happier.Written and directed by Jay Lee, this dementedly un-PC film sees the performers of an illegal pole-dancing joint (including ex-porn starlet Jenna Jameson) turning into super-strippers after contracting a zombie virus. Mega-sexy and blessed with some killer moves, the dead girls certainly know how to pull in the punters (much to the delight of owner Ian, played by Robert Englund). The trouble is, they also enjoy eating them too!With non-stop nudity, including full frontal from several of the dancers (but, unfortunately, not from the blonde hottie who plays one of the soldiers sent in to save the day) and some of the squishiest, most gratuitous gore that I have had the pleasure of seeing in quite a while (the number of heads that go pop in this one is quite staggering), Zombie Strippers is perfect popcorn entertainment for those looking for some mindless horror to while away their time. The acting may be wooden, and the plot rather uneventful, but this one really delivers where it matters\u0097with endless shots of silicone-enhanced boobs and severed body parts!Utilising both traditional make-up FX and CGI, the bloodletting is incredibly impressive, with one victim getting his jaw pulled off, another having their flesh pulled from their body to reveal bare bones, and almost everyone else ending up with their noggins in less than perfect condition (with damage inflicted by everything from a stamp on the head to close-range shotgun blasts).",

There's also an element of satire, but mostly what it is is a relentlessly trashy, tongue in cheek sexy / gory zombie horror comedy. The cast performs it for all that it's worth, and there's enough erotic dancing to keep things spicy. (It might have been nicer had there been more stripping, though.)It's the future, and George W. Bush has been elected to a fourth term with Arnold Schwarzenegger as vice-president. The U.S. is waging war with several countries, including Canada...and Alaska. Against this backdrop is a tried and true story of the Army developing a chemical weapon that will re-animate dead soldiers. Of course things go wrong, and a special military squad is sent to take care of the problem. One of the squad is infected and hightails it out of there, ending up inside a strip club. He infects star dancer Kat (porn star Jenna Jameson), who in turn infects other dancers who infect club patrons. Caught in the ensuing mess are people such as cheerfully sleazy owner Ian (an ingratiating Robert Englund).Talented Jay Lee wears several hats on this show: writer, director, cinematographer, editor. He keeps the pace pretty consistent and the action lively. There may be way too much digital gore for practical effects fans, but at least the movie doesn't skimp at all on bloody mayhem. One of the coolest effects is a patron who gets the entire lower half of his head chomped off. The dancing is naturally pleasurable to watch, with the comely actresses just throwing themselves into the routines. Lee has his offbeat movie just hit the ground running and takes his audience on a decent roller coaster ride. Roxy Saint co-stars as Goth styled stripper Lilith; cast member Joey Medina is endearing and funny as put upon janitor Paco.

It has a huge, delightfully klutzy political premise that some will enjoy and some will not find amusing. I found it hilarious. Most of all, it's great fun. Robert Englund is having a ball as Ian Essko (get it? Ionesco? \"Rhinoceros?\"), and that communicates to the audience. Did I say over the top? This film leaves the top behind in the first 15 minutes and never looks back. There are cheap ethnic jokes, cockamamey puns, serious stripper dances, outlandish gore effects (very well done in most cases), paramilitary parody, satirical commentary on Bush/Cheney, some hot rockin' music, including three songs by one of the \"strippers\" (also very well done). There's a Nietzche joke that had me laughing for days. And there is the big surprise, Jenna Jameson. Jenna is best known for her adult film work (why do they call it that?) but here she shows off her amazing comic timing and, at times, disturbingly physical sense of conveying her living dead status. Her \"death\" scene is the most harrowing I've seen in a film. She does one dance number that manages to be, at once, very sexy (she has had 18 years of serious dance training in ballet, jazz, etc.) and at the same time, somehow \"off,\" neurologically\u0085 and very hungry. Some of the funniest moments in the film belong to her. I'm not a fan of porn, but would buy a ticket to see her in a mainstream film. It's odd that she'd take on this kind of anti-right-wing jocular- jugular-prop, being a confirmed Republican. (\"When you're rich, you want Republicans in office,\" she said), but through it all she's a great sport and surprisingly funny.In short (too late for that, I suppose), this is a crazy indie foray into delightful excess, and a very funny film if you're not too restrained by political correctness; there is nothing correct about this film. It also has a high gore content, so be warned. It's delightful, far more than it might have been. Highly recommended.",

Yep, this picture sure ain't no subtle and sensitive work of substantial cinematic art, but it nonetheless comes on like delightfully deviant and deranged gangbusters because Lee goes all the way and then some with the intrinsic cheesiness and sleaziness of the hysterically lurid premise. Moreover, it's acted with definite hammy panache by an enthusiastic cast: Robert England has a ball as smarmy, greedy, and amoral club owner Ian, Jameson likewise really sinks her teeth into her juicy part, buxom knockout Shamron Moore hits it out of the part with her deliciously venomous portrayal of the jealous and spiteful Jeannie, Joey Medina contributes a gut-busting turn as bumbling janitor Paco, and Jennifer Holland projects a winningly sweet'n'spunky charm as naive farm girl Jessy. The bevy of smoking hot babes that include sultry Goth goddess Roxy Saint and tall ravishing redhead Penny Drake certainly don't hurt matters any.

The story is very simple, a bitten soldier stumbles into a strip bar and bites on of the strippers. What the film deliver is some cheap CGI, the gun shots are pure CGI, it also gives us a lot of nudity. Once the soldier arrives at the strip club you will have a lot of stripping, Jenna even goes full frontal. It's bald kitty cats galore. When they are dressed it's still in sexy underwear. Naturally with zombies you need blood, some is done in gory fashion others are done with cheesy CGI. Overall, it does have some gruesome shots, especially the one with the removal of a tongue. On the part of the acting I can't say that much, be honest you tossers, you only watch it for the zombie strippers. A low budget that has all the ingredients for an exploitive horror.

From those two words you should be able to tell whether you're going to love this film, or completely hate it. Personally, I think it's definitely worth a watch if you don't take your movies too seriously. It certainly doesn't take itself seriously.It starts off in a 'Resident Evil' like facility where a virus gets - accidentally of course - let loose on the general public - or rather the patrons and staff of a sleazy stripclub. And - guess what - it turns people into zombies. I'm guessing you're expecting much nudity, black comedy and plenty of gore. And it has all of those. Although, I have to say that when dealing with a story about a group of people who take their clothes off for a living, there isn't quite as much nudity as you'd expect (you'll only gets a few topless dances here and there - if you have the internet then you've probably seen much more!).The characters are pretty much exactly the types you'll expect to find in any similar horror film. The 'stereotypes' are particularly noticeable, such as 'the Mexican man' and the 'Eastern European woman' and so on. You won't remember any of the characters' names when the credits roll. About the only person you might recognise would be Robert (Freddy Krueger) Englund who runs the club. It's always nice to see him without a burned face and spiky fingers and he's probably about the best cast-member when it comes to acting. The rest are pretty forgettable, only being hired for their - er - 'assets,' but they do the job well.I know some people may find this film distasteful (and not for the amount of blood flying) due to it being about strippers, but it's really not as distasteful as you might think. I'm guessing that mainly guys will go for this, but I think if you enjoy black comedy horror with plenty of gore (which is quite cheaply computer-generated!) and are prepared for something infinitely low brow and stupid then you could do worse than this.",

The first half of the movie is taken up with repetitive stripping scenes and the second half is made up of repetitive kill scenes.There's no middle ground, no interest or attempts at characterisation. We're treated to an acutely embarrassed Robert Englund who alternates between slumming it and hamming it, and once-upon-a-porn-star Jemma Jameson who looks far more frightening at the film's outset than she does when she turns into a zombie later on!

While eliminating as many zombies as possible, Major Camus (Catero Colbert) and Lieutenant Ryker (Jen Alex Gonzalez) manage to let bitten marine Byrdflough (Zak Kilberg), afraid of being killed, get away, and he ends up in a near underground strip club. Blyrdflough manages to bite star stripper Kat (porn star Jenna Jameson), but apparently women have more of a threshold, so she is turned into a zombie, of sorts, but still doing her job, being much more sexy than before, and earning much more money for greedy club owner Ian Essko (Robert Englund, aka Freddy Krueger). Obviously the affected girls that follow, along with Kat, still have a hunger for flesh, but they and Ian make sure they eat back stage, so the money can still roll in, and the zombie customers are locked up. Eventually though the success is to end when someone lets out the zombie customers, and the zombie strippers just attack anyone in the open, and the specialists do show up to help the survivors get out alive.

Englund is great at being mad, he's kind of like that in real life, and Jameson makes a reasonably good actress, most people think she is too beautiful to be a porn icon, maybe she should have gone down this route. As for the zombie stuff, the gory effects are just as over-the-top as a proper zombie flick, and the dialogue is deliberately rubbish, so you can sit back and a enjoy a good satirical comedy horror, or you can enjoy flesh eating creatures getting naked and pole dancing, I know it's not a good film, but it's worthwhile enough as a horror comedy.

In any case the shifts in tone were a little hard to get used to. The gore is sometimes very delicious and creative with attention paid to fans of organic gore. Sometimes it looks plain old cheesy, bad CGI style gore. The acting is overall good, even when over the top. However for my taste no matter how aware they were of their own \"bad\" performances I think the movie could have benefited from a lot less \"Look at my bad performance wink wink\" acting and more of the playing-it-straight acting (believe it or not Jenna Jameson is one of the more successful at keeping this in mind).

Presumably they were very drunk when they saw it, or maybe I wasn't drunk enough when I watched it. Even in my most optimistic mindset, I can't possibly bring myself to write anything positive about \"Zombie Strippers!\" This splatter-comedy is embarrassingly UN-funny, childish, retarded, amateurish and actually very boring. The combination of flesh-eating corpses and large-breasted porn stars stripping their clothes off is undeniably appealing to most horror fanatics, but it all becomes dull and repetitive very fast. Writer/director Jay Lee thinks he's very wit and funny, especially regarding his observations of nowadays politics and social situations, but the quality of his jokes and satiric remarks are even lower than those of Pauly Shore. The film already opens painfully, with a news bulletin announcing that George W. Bush just got re-elected for a fourth presidential term and, since he declared war to about half of the world, America is running out of soldiers. Therefore, military scientists developed a serum to resurrect dead tissue and thus create the perfect indestructible warriors. Naturally the experiments run out of hand and a special army squad \u0096 dumb but potent \u0096 are sent in to exterminate the test species. One infected soldier escapes and finds shelter in a sleazy and illegal strip joint nearby. He promptly attacks the prime stripper girl (Jenna Jameson), but the professional bimbo rises again and continues her dance duties, though not without occasionally devouring a horny customer or a fellow strip girl. Call me old-fashioned or - if you must - a sourpuss, but I sincerely think slapstick comedy and violent zombie action are two cinematic themes you shouldn't even begin to mix. The granddaddy of zombie movies, George A. Romero, always managed to process subtle yet biting social satire into his classic gore movies, but at least he never undermined the level of suspense or the overall grim atmosphere by doing so. Since \"Shaun of the Dead\", everybody seems to think they're capable of making a horror comedy but all these untalented filmmakers don't realize that zombies \u0096 as in people coming back from the dead to hunt the flesh of the living \u0096 are actually no laughing matter. Jay Lee desperately tries to be hilarious, with his absurd stripper audience stereotypes & competitive and hostile interactions between the girls mutually, but everything fails miserably. The production can't even distinguish itself from the rest through its special effects, as the computer-generated gore and make-up gimmicks are very average and clich\u00e9d. Remarkable, however, is that the girls' breasts remain intact whilst the rest of their bodies decompose, so I guess these silicone implants are zombie-resistant. Good to know! Robert \"Freddy Kruger\" Englund appeared in a lot of junk recently (\"Hatchet\", \"Heartstopper\", \"Black Swarm\", \u0085) just to claim his pay check, but this is a new low even for him. The rest of the cast was unknown to me, except of course Miss Jenna Jameson. But if you're interested to see her unnaturally large boobs constantly falling out of tops and into a man's hands, there are about five hundred other movies and websites to check out instead.",

I had hoped that it might be one of those \"so bad, it's good\" movies. Instead, it overshoots \"so bad, it's good\" and lands in \"so bad, it's really, really, really bad\".The story, which is filled with lame jokes and wrapped up in some juvenile political satire at the expense of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, starts with a squad of soldiers sent to put down a zombie outbreak at a research lab. A virus was created to reanimate corpses so they could be used to fight in war. One of the soldiers gets bitten and runs away to an illegal strip club, where he bites the lead dancer (Jenna Jameson). She becomes a zombie, which in addition to filling her with the hunger for human flesh, also makes her a much better stripper.She bites a couple of other strippers and these undead skanks become a sensation, driving degenerate strip club patrons into such a frenzy they don't even care when a living girl gets naked on stage. That provokes jealousy and horror in some of the other strippers. However, the strip club owner (Robert Englund) just enjoys all the money he's making, though his plan to keep the strippers' zombified victims locked up in the basement turns out to be more trouble than all the money in the world. They get loose, chaos breaks out, including a zombie strip-off and an undead vagina being used in a way that I can't quite figure out how to describe.In fairness, Zombie Strippers is trying to be an over-the-top comedy.

The jokes are putrid and this crew of alleged actors has all the comedic timing of a broken metronome that's sticking out of the burst stomach of a dead pig that's been left under the hot sun all day. I've seen Holocaust movies that were funnier than this film.This is another example of actors who can't act and a writer/director who can neither write nor direct.

Setting out to make a hilariously bad film is like intentionally becoming the world's fattest man. The end result is never pretty to look at.If you're one of the three people on Earth who hasn't already seen Jenna Jameson naked, you can find it in Zombie Strippers. Be forewarned; only two other actress get nude in this thing and only one of them is attractive. There is lots and lots of blood and gore and you can see Robert Englund embarrass himself with humor too corny for even the worst Nightmare on Elm Street sequel.If you took some of Jenna Jameson's XXX films and edited out the graphic sex, you'd probably end up with movies that were still better than Zombie Strippers. Don't even bother with this DVD.",

            "content": "Zombie Strippers! (2008)** (out of 4) Set in the near future, President Bush has just been re-elected to a fourth term and has banned all public nudity. The country is also fighting at least ten other countries in war, which means a soldier shortage so the government makes a virus that will make the dead return to life. At a local illegal strip joint, a zombie bites the most popular stripper (Jenna Jameson) making her a zombie so the club owner (Robert Englund) decides that zombies sell and asks all his strippers to turn into the living dead. There's no doubt this film is trying to be a cult movie and that's where it goes wrong. Every cult movie in the history of cinema didn't intend to be a camp or cult movie. You can't be a camp movie because turning into camp is something that just happens. Ed Wood, Al Adamson and countless other directors didn't set out to make a camp film but instead they tried doing something serious but it turned out so bad and then the camp around the film started. Even with all that said this isn't that bad of a movie if you're a fan of the genre. You can look at the title and tell that there are non-stop zombies and strippers, which leads to non-stop nudity and gore. The zombies in the film look pretty good and they're a lot better than a lot of the recent zombie movies. There's countless gore throughout, which will make fans of the genre happen. Throat slashings, decapitations and just about everything else takes place. The nudity ranges from the sexy to the nasty to the downright bizarre. The highlight of the film involves the \"eaten alive lap dances\", which are at times hilarious. Englund is his typical, over the top self but he makes for some good laughs. Jameson does a decent job in her role and really isn't any worse than what would normally be in a film like this. I'm not sure what's going on with her but she's looking kinda strange these days. The rest of the actors are rather lame but hey, this is a B horror movie. There are a lot of political jokes, which fall flat on their faces but there are some good running jokes involving an illegal immigrant who must clean up after the zombies.",

However, that said, this is a zombie flick that is worth your while to go see. (I myself had to travel thirty five miles to get to a showing.. I'm in the Chicagoland area, and they one had one theater playing this film in all of northern Illinois. What is it with producers these days, they disregard their core audience and its location. I saw the other day that another horror film, entitled Rogue, about a killer croc was advertised as playing in the ten biggest American markets, yet it omitted New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago, which are basically the three largest markets by far in the entire country. What's up with that?) Anyway, the film centers on a diabolical lab, an unscrupulous Strip Club manager, some extremely shallow strippers, and outrageously perverse club patrons. Jenna Jameson plays the first stripper to be infected with an escaped zombie virus. Robert Englund is the club manager, that upon finding out of the popularity of his deceased strippers popularity on the pole now that she's one of the undead, decides that all is bright and sunny with the world.. Despite the occasional hiccup of a patron being devoured by his now popular zombie stripper. For some reason, the men of the town find a decaying almost lifeless corpse rotting before them while seductively (or maybe, perhaps, more-so raunchily) dancing, is ever more popular and appealing than, say; watching real warm blooded, human strippers. A commentary on necrophilia? maybe, but they play this to schlocky good fun. Where most zombie films take themselves too seriously when they don't have the talent to back it up (director, writer, cast, effects, etc.) this film just lets it all hang out. Similar in it's tongue in cheek approach to \"2001 maniacs\", this film lets its cast roll about in their dismal acting, and cheesy dialogue. And they relish every minute of it.On a side note, anyone else creeped out in Jenna Jameson's looks now adays? Look at photos of her from two or three years ago and now. Looks like she's transforming into one of those cat people. Creepy eyes, and the face looks tight and awful. Apparently wearing a pearl necklace will wreak havoc on one's face.",

You're getting bad acting on purpose, you're getting clich\u00e9s, you're getting naked women, and of course zombies.The social commentary of this film speaks more than some of the more mainstream movies I've seen of late. The notion that guys don't care what they throw their money at when it comes to seeing naked women, is pretty damning all things considered. Seeing the contrast between attractive women, and then the same women only zombified, says a lot about what strippers probably live with every day. Apparently you have to be dead inside to be a good stripper, or at least have a grasp of Nietzsche, or Kant.With that said, I've seen worse Zombie movies this year. This one had some laugh out loud moments, especially with the racial slurs, and the more vile constructs of zombie behavior. I think I'll leave the discovery of all that to those who watch this movie. There are worse films out there than this one, and as juvenile as it was, it wasn't as bad as the trailer made it out to be.The only thing I really couldn't stand, was the actors on the so called Special Forces team. Talk about retarded. The CG effects were also pretty weak, but the practical effects however... Icky.If you want something that will make you think a bit, while you objectify zombie women, this movie is for you.",

The unit is told some zombies are lose and they can be killed with a shot to the head or when zapped by electricity. They go after the zombies and realize that the electric gun doesn't work all that well and some are bitten. Those that are have to be executed. When one of the bitten military guys sees that, he escapes and ends up in a strip bar.We meet the strippers, the boss, the lady in charge of the strippers, the dj, the janitor, the security guard. At first we deal mostly with stripper drama- the rivalry between two strippers, the angry goth stripper, the new virginal and religious stripper who's there to make money to help her sick grandmother against her boyfriends wishes, and others. The boss is played by Englund and he's all about the money. When the military guy turned zombie bites the star stripper, business goes on as usual. Not only that, but the customers for some reason go wild over zombie strippers. She starts attacking customers, and other strippers volunteer to be turned into zombies as well. Eventually all hell breaks lose. Then at the end we learn a bit more about the research project.Zombie Strippers as one would expect is campy, silly, at times dumb, but at other times the script show signs of intelligence. There are plenty of philosophical references (Nietzsche, Blavatsky, Camus, ontology, existentialist, fatalism, optimism, and more) and also philosophical musings about life and its meaning. These aren't dumb people making a dumb movie, but smart people who saw an opportunity to inject some brains into it what would otherwise have been a braindead movie. The movie is also very political. As a horror movie, zombie strippers is actually pretty good, it doesn't have a lot of gore but when it does, it's very good. It combines both physical and CGI gore and both are good, of course physical effects are much better. The strip club is among the worst settings for a movie, few movies manage to convey the supposed titillation of strip clubs. But Zombie Strippers does actually have some pretty decent strip acts. Some of them are in zombie make up, which is a bit odd, but even under makeup and contact lenses the beauty of the women comes through. The female cast is very good- from the military girls to pretty much every stripper, they are attractive girls, unfortunately not all of them strip. A shame in the case of the lovely Whitney Anderson.Zombie Strippers would have been better had it taken itself more seriously. Too many actors are playing for it laughs here, even though their character's life is at stake. It should be possible to make a good, serious, and smart B movie, even horror movie, that doesn't feel it has to be funny or silly to find an audience.",

            "content": "Indulge me for a moment, please, as I quote myself from an old review: \"It can be a tricky balancing act, coming up with the perfect film in the genre known as the horror comedy; a picture that is hilariously funny while at the same time being truly scary. And while there is no shortage of films with a decidedly uneven ratio of horror::comedy--such as 1960's 'The Little Shop of Horrors,' 1974's 'Young Frankenstein' and 1975's 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show'--such films usually come off as pure comedies, only with a horror setting. But when the balance is just right, such as in 'The Ghost Breakers' (1940), 'Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein' (1948, and still probably the finest exemplar of the horror comedy ever made) and 'Spider Baby' (1964), the result can be a timeless and wonderful entertainment.\" I wrote those words in my review of the 2002 cult item \"Bubba Ho-Tep,\" which succeeded wildly as both horror and comedy, I felt. Well, now I must report that, to my great surprise, I have discovered yet another picture that manages that tricky balancing act: Jay Lee's \"Zombie Strippers\" (2008), which is not only laugh-out-loud funny, as might have been expected, but also features more gross-out, gut-munching, head-bursting zombie carnage than the last three George A. Romero movies combined!In the film's hilarious opening, a ridiculously gung-ho Marine team, the Z Squad (clearly patterned after the tough-as-nails crew in the sci-fi epic \"Aliens\"), is called in to quell a zombie revolt at a government lab, where the living dead were being developed to act as the supersoldiers of the future. The zombies are effectively slaughtered in a gonzo bloodbath, but one of the Marines, Byrdflough (!), gets bitten and infected during the battle. Fearful of being preemptively shot by one of his team members, Byrdflough escapes the scene and hides out in the local Rhino Club, which is run by a character named Ian Essko, and played by none other than Freddy Krueger portrayer himself, Robert Englund. (Literate viewers may recall that French playwright Eugene Ionesco came out with a play in 1959 called \"Rhinoceros\"; just one of the many literate in-jokes scattered throughout the film.) Before long, Byrdflough turns into a zombie himself, and attacks and kills the club's head stripper, Kat (played with zest by \"The Queen of Porn,\" Jenna Jameson). But Kat doesn't stay dead for long, and her abilities as a pole dancer are only enhanced by her zombified state, resulting in her enormous popularity with the male buffoons in the audience! And soon, all the other jealous ecdysiasts are desirous of becoming zombies, too. Ian's new zombie strippers are raking in major bucks for the club, before long, but there IS a problem: All the male customers who the gals infect have in turn become zombies themselves, and have been locked away in the Rhino's basement. And that basement is reaching the point of maximum capacity....All the gore hounds out there who may be thinking that this silly-sounding movie won't deliver the requisite zombie mayhem might be in for a big surprise as \"Zombie Strippers\" proceeds. The FX in the film are terrifically impressive, the makeup work all that could be desired, the blood and guts worthy of approbation by Tom Savini. Just watch as Lilith, the Goth stripper, splits a guy's head open to eat his tongue, or how Madame Blavatski (the hilarious Russian in charge of the strippers, and named, of course, for whatever reason, after the notorious Russian occultist of the 19th century, Madame Helena Blavatsky), after being zombified, has her body blown apart, bit by bit, by machine gun fire. And you won't believe what a zombie can do in regard to a pole dance...simply eye boggling! The film, as mentioned, is also wildly funny, with many hilarious lines; the references to this viewer's all-time favorite movie, \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,\" as well as to the cult fave \"The Warriors,\" almost made me fall off the couch with laughter. Other hilarious bits: the newscast that opens the film, detailing George W.'s fourth term as president (yikes!), and the scene in which Ian's assistant, the Mexican Paco, looks at a photo of his wife and two daughters, before going off to fight the undead, and tearfully says, \"Adios, Maria, Maria, Maria....\" And just get a load of what zombie Kat is able to do with a bunch of pool balls (decency prevents me from saying)! As for Englund, he gives a fine comedic performance here, and his obnoxious, germaphobic character (he is constantly spraying disinfectant on the girls, and saying things like \"You walking herpe\") is a genuine inducer of big laffs. Of course, the film features fairly copious amounts of nudity, and many breasts are on display...some of them even natural. (Certainly not Jenna's, though; no two breasts could ever be that perfectly matched and symmetrical!) The picture is also a lot smarter than it needs to be, with numerous philosophical references (Kat, hilariously, is shown reading a book by Nietzsche, which she cannot understand until after she becomes a zombie; the film transpires in Sartre, Nebraska; and several of the strippers indulge in fairly deep existential discussions), a recomplicated plot finale, and timely and clever put-downs of the Bush administration (granted, a fairly broad target for satire). The film is surely not in the same great league as \"Bubba Ho-Tep\" or the other wonderful classics mentioned up top, but it still manages to succeed as both horror and comedy, for which the picture has my grudging respect. Who would have ever thought that a film featuring zombie face dancing could be so good?",

Jenna Jameson is perhaps the most popular porn star of the Internet generation but this is actually my first time watching her in anything! She looks great, obviously as the star stripper who incurs the jealousy, admiration and love of her colleagues who include a devout, virginal Christian girl (she even has a picture of Christ stuck to her mirror) who's doing it for the first time because her granny needs quick dough for an operation! The girls are not merely attractive but surprisingly throw themselves into their roles with gusto (ditto for their trainer from the \"Old Country\"). Robert Englund, too, is great fun as the sleazy, opportunistic but cowardly (losing his nerve when left alone with the zombies in his office, he whines to himself \"Do I suck, or what?\") owner of the joint with an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder complex \u0096 in a hilarious scene, he also proudly displays his NRA card but is ignorant of how to actually load a gun! Besides, he continuously mistreats his Latino cleaning man (who gets to imitate Alfonso Bedoya in THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE [1948] twice) \u0096 when it's time, then, to go all-out with the zombies (albeit a very short-lived act), he takes care to say his farewells beforehand to an unimaginatively-named family and even part lovingly from his donkey companion! The stripping sequences do not disappoint in the nudity department and the rowdy reaction of the punters is amusing to watch \u0096 especially after the strippers get zombified and start inviting them for deadly lap-dances which invariably leads to mucho gore by way of flesh-munching; ironically, the victims' screams of agony are taken to be ones of pleasure by the enthusiastic but clueless crowd! The billiard-ball shooting duel between Jameson and her chief rival is a dubious highlight\u0085but I'm still not sure why the zombie strippers became so popular with the customers \u0096 other than that they were far more energetic than when in human form (in view of the fact, I suppose, that they were going to make a meal of their customers).",

One of the better elements within this one is the incredibly cheesy atmosphere within this which really gives this an incredibly fun time reveling in all the cheese and sleaze. Form the concept of ow the strip club is run and the manner of keeping the infected around, the backstage antics of the hypochondriac boss afraid to touch the girls and the ease with which everyone accepts the inevitable of how the growing zombified hordes overtake the club here gives this such a cheesy atmosphere. This here gives the relentless and constant stripping scenes where there's plenty of extreme dancing, topless gyrating and partying that goes on inside the private booths where they feast on the customers who find themselves forced to deal with the remaining aftermath of turning the others into zombies as well into not just the cheesy atmosphere here but also adds a great bit of action into this. There's plenty to like about the opening raid on the research lab overrun with creatures as the team lays waste to dozens of creatures in spectacular gunfights blasting them to pieces, the rounding up the turning zombies an their discarded limbs left behind and the group's attempts to hold off the rampaging zombies loose inside the back of the building as the gunfight causes the group to fall victim to the creatures here and bringing along the film's best part here in the final half overtaking the club. Filled with exceptionally fun shootouts here in the parlor and out in the different hallways trying to keep them from getting loose, scores of fantastic kills here both of the swarms killing patrons and the amazing duel between the two rival zombies on the stage which is highly enjoyable. Another positive aspect here for all this is the superb make-up here, with utterly spectacular zombies filled with unique looks and great deformities, truly spectacular gore and all leaving plenty of mess behind which is so much fun here. Along with the finely- delivered nudity, there's so much to like here that overcomes the film's big flaw. The big downer here is the need for the existential debates here which are really overlong and have little place here.

If the name of the film hasn't suggested it already, this is a seedy B-movie that puts zombies and strippers in a situation. The title also pretty much sums up the plot, and generally the whole purpose of the film. In a crazy way, the inspiration for this film comes from a play called \"Rhinoceroses\" by Eugene Ionesco. In that, people begin to turn into rhinos but nobody seems too bothered. The character played by Robert Englund in this film is called Ian Essko - a direct homage to the play writer.In the not-so-distant future, America is still at war with pretty much everybody thanks to President George Bush and Vice-President Arnold Schwarzenegger. Soon America will slowly lose ground in their war efforts on account of not having enough troops, to compensate for the vast loss of military personnel they have suffered over the years, a research program has been initiated to reanimate dead cells. The hope is that reanimated brains may allow for an army of the undead to do America's fighting, bulking their army back up in volume. An experiment goes wrong, a crack-commando Z-Team is sent in to clear the place of any zombies. One of them gets bit and manages to escape the facility. The escaped (not yet a) zombie makes it to an underground strip club called \"the Rhino\" (underground because nudity is banned under President Bush) where he bites one of the star strippers. Far from being distraught, she is happy to have been bitten as it seemingly makes her a better stripper, albeit at the expense of her flesh deteriorating. With her increased stripper ability, she is taking customers away from the other girls, so some of them happily volunteer to be bitten. The zombie strippers feast during private dances; after a short bit of titillation for their client they generally eat them. The virus spreads around the club, but club owner Ian Essko tries to keep everything under control by keeping the zombie strippers in cages. That only lasts so long as one of the strippers opens the cage to allow herself to be bitten, but what she has also done is let the zombie strippers out of their cage to cause chaos. Thanks to a late arrival by the Z-Team the remaining strippers and club patrons fight for their survival.The main stars of this film are Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger) as Ian Essko, famous porn star Jenna Jameson as Kat, indie-musician Roxy Saint as Lilith, Penny Drake as Sox, comedian Joey Medina as Paco, and a bevy of good looking models and actresses. For what the film is, the cast do an ok-ish job - it's clear from the delivery who has experience on screen and who doesn't. The film is of course intentionally cheesy and camp with over the top sequences in it. It looks bad and low budget but it's supposed to. The satire and jokes miss the mark by a long way at times - but that rarely becomes a massive problem. The CGI is laughable at times and rarely believable. The whole thing is pretty weak and only stands up if you are a couple of drinks into the night already.For all my negativity, the film delivers with what it intended, there are zombie strippers in the film. Yes this is a super low budget bad film, but it's unapologetic in being that. If you want a cultured and classy performance then don't bother with this. If you want exploding heads, t&a, nudity, gore, zombies, rock music, poor acting, laughable effects - then my friend, you have come to the right place. This is never going to win awards, and it might never achieve cult status. You might even wonder why anyone bothered making this and what the point is. I say don't... don't try and interpret this because you will give yourself a headache. There is no point, there is no justification to the why - it just is. Nothings explained or wrapped up, there is no social commentary, there is no hidden message about valuing life or the objectification of women. The film just is, because why not.It's not the kind of film I could put on with kids in the room, or my granny sat in the corner.

True, they're being strong and capable in tank tops and camouflage bras, but they don't foul up situations to be rescued by their male teammates or blubber helplessly in hysteria. They're good soldiers who are respected as equals by their fellow soldiers. Few serious actions flicks (besides Aliens) can claim to present female characters this well.It's a cheesy B-movie, and I wish more movies offered their audience this much intellectual meat.",

There are plenty of quality stripper moments, but this is a double-edged sword because....On the negative side, the strippers are all bizarrely enhanced (if you know what I mean, and I think that you do) and rather odd looking. (Holy Cow, Jenna! Don't try to get anything you have any tighter than it already is, or you'll roll up like an old-fashioned window shade.) The left wing \"political satire\" also gets a bit old after the first ten or fifteen minutes. (OK, OK...we get it. George W. Bush is a pawn of greedy capitalists.) The digital effects vary wildly, with some being quite good and others being almost childish. The make-up effects are universally pretty good. The soundtrack is above-average, with some killer songs snatched from here and there.Strangely, the deleted scenes included on the DVD are better than a lot of what made it to the screen.

Seeing the same girls doing their routines over and over again just isn't that interesting more after a while. There must be at least a dozen strip acts in this movie.Of course I understand that this movie deliberately tried to be bad and silly with its story and all but it doesn't make the movie good though. The movie is too amateur like made and looking for that and it just simply isn't entertaining enough for a good and silly B-movie or cult classic. A shame, since the movie definitely showed potential and normally I'm also able to appreciate a movie like this.Nudity and gore are the two words that can sum up the movie. The nudity is better than its gore though. The girls are all fine looking and so does the gore actually but just the way it got handled and thrown into the movie doesn't make it work out. So as an horror this movie is definitely a poor one, as a comedy it definitely works out better but its humor mostly relies on spoofing well known movies.The movie begins as an \"Aliens\" clone and then soon turns into a \"From Dusk Till Dawn\" type of movie. It's apparent were the film-makers got their inspiration from and they actually make no trouble to hide it and they instead are proud of it and show this. This could had worked if the movie was actually fun and entertaining through its silliness. But the movie is simply tiresome and stupid for that.I'll bet Robert Englund still had fun though. He seemed to be enjoying himself while filming and probably also already knew how bad the movie would turn out to be, experienced as he is.I wanted to like the movie but it was just too tiresome and poorly done.

Other strippers become infected and the feeding happens in VIP rooms. The gore effects are really gruesome. There is plenty of flesh ripping, organ tearing, head-splitting, splattering, wet and sloppy, gore for two or three zombie films. We are even treated to a zombie cat-fight.While this film will not go down as a genre-defining or important zombie film, I still recommend it. Nor, is this film intended to be a social commentary.

From intentional continuity and plot holes that take a stab at the trash spun out of Hollywood, to the contrast of the low grade movie style with the use of Nietzsche works (in a joking manner that never seems to take itself seriously, like the rest of this movie), to the plain blunt comedy and absurdity of every second of this movie from start to finish. This movie has managed to take the single worst plot concept ever published and create one of the most intelligently witty and enjoyable movies ever made.The smarter, more sophisticated audience I show this movie to, the more they appreciate it.

In this instance we find that the government has a (supposedly \"fail-safe\") chemical lab in Satre, Nebraska, which has created a toxin that creates zombies. A special army company is called upon to exterminate them but a soldier (played by Zak Kilberg) is bitten and rather than being killed by his own team escapes to a nearby illegal strip club. Once inside he dies and changes into a zombie, whereupon he bites one of the strippers named \"Kat\" (Jenna Jameson). She then changes into a zombie and performs an electrifying strip-tease which results in wild applause by the audience. Soon most of the strippers want to become zombies in order to excite the spectators as well. The club manager (played by Robert Englund of \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" fame) encourages all of this because he starts making money hand over fist due to increased customer demand. But as the zombies multiply things get out of control and the special army task force moves in to contain the situation. So much for the plot. As far as the movie is concerned, it had its good parts and bad parts with the bad parts really taking stage at the very end and totally ruining this film. As a result I have to give this movie the lowest rating possible. The simple fact is that the director (Jay Lee) had the talent necessary to make a decent film. All he needed to do was write an average script and use a little imagination. He clearly wasn't up to the task.",

            "content": "\"Zombie Strippers\" manages a preternatural combination of theater of the absurd, hot pink lingerie, and the Smith and Wesson air soft pump action shotgun. The ability of the 20th century's major Continental philosophies to adapt to the 3rd millennium is examined through the competing Weltanschauung of a cadre of sharply divided strippers in the American Midwest. The characters are forced to define and own their ontology when a government manufactured zombie virus is unleashed. Yes, it may be possible to continue stripping after coming back from messy death, but is there more to life? Ultimately, both the Nietzschean Ubermensch and Satre's existential despair are shown to be inadequate responses to the human condition, as well as to the zombie condition. In fact, a greater level of alienation then has been previously imagined is shown to be possible when a being is left severed from humanity while still sentient. The failing Gestalt of excessively broad Panglossian optimism is laid bare, along with the entire cast. Rather than presenting a justification for self-annihilating submission to a mob which demands conformity as payment for acceptance, the protagonists must embrace individualism both qua the only reasonable way to survive and qua the innate demand of humanity. Sacrificing the enduring emotional vitality and undeniable free will of a human life span for the illusion of release to be found in reanimation leads only to unrecoverable angst for those strippers who submit to the zombie virus. This piece is properly read as a modern re-assessment of the lessons the Enlightenment. While a cynical view of religion's ability to define the scope and meaning of life is buttressed, we all - even a zombie in her actual death throws - must account for our choices. Infinite rebirths are not an option. Meanwhile, fresh philosophical challenges are brought to bear in the characters of an aging Russian lap dancer and her harsh pragmatism and Paco, the illegal janitor who draws on his own cultural traditions to script a deeply personal reaction to the zombification of his co- workers. Numerous definitions of humanity are tested: rationalism, logic, empathy - but it ultimately our ability to choose life and to find beauty in the sheer act of being alive that separates the living from the merely undead. The audience is asked to reconcile being human and being alive, having first debated if there is is a foundational schism at all. More deep is the question hinted at and left unanswered by the film: if science, in the form of a toupe wearing lab tech who unleashes a chemo- virus that reanimates dead flesh, unleashes evil; and if the humanities, in the form of remarkably fresh looking strippers who toss off gems of epistemological wisdom between turns on the stage, are left to address the terrible question of whether to choose zombification for greater tips, where is the solution? Believers in eleatic monism may be disappointed, but anyone who has ever wrestled with Being and Becoming will find some common themes dressed up like new with nipple tassles.",

To be brutally honest Zombie Stripper! is a film that appeals the the lowest common denominator & treats it's audience like mindless idiots, you know the most famous & successful horror films are the ones which are serious, try to make a point & try to tell an engrossing story like The Exorcist (1973), The Omen (1976), Dawn of the Dead (1978) & The Shining (1980) to name but four & sometimes a totally moronic brain-dead film like Zombie Strippers! comes along & I genuinely wonder how far we as a species have come. The script felt to me like it was written by a spotty prepubescent teenager who tries to mix as much cheap gore & bare breasted women as possible to satisfy his masturbatory fantasies, now I have no problem with nudity in a film but when there's so much of it & when it's so dull & tame it becomes incredibly boring & tedious very quickly. Sometimes you can have too much of a good thing. The actual plot sucks, I simply don't get the motivation for these strippers to want to become zombies & I don't understand why so many men keep going to the strip club to see ugly woman strip while trying to look sexy dancing round a pole. Then there's the attempts at humour, the one-liners fall flat, the visual gags suck & I didn't even raise a single smile during the 90 odd minute run time much less an actual laugh. There are certain people out there who consider Zombie Strippers! fun, well my argument is what's fun about it? It has no story worth mentioning, it's unfunny & the gags are crap & there's seemingly endless scenes of strippers dancing which to me just got really boring, really quickly.Available in both 'R' & 'Unrated' version in the US I was a little disappointed by the gore levels here, there's a lot of blood & some nice exploding head shots but not much else, a woman's skin & flesh is removed from her arms & legs, a guy has his head ripped in half, there are various bullet wounds, there's some flesh biting & an awful CGI effect as a woman is literally shot to nothing. As the title would suggest there's plenty of stripping on show & lots of naked breast's but all of the girls on show seem to be surgically enhanced & not very natural. The jokey tone of the film means it's not scary or atmospheric & I sat there watching it deeply unmoved in any way. It has an unfunny stab at some political satire with the whole situation being blamed on George Bush (hey guy's he's not the president anymore) who they predictably paint as an idiot (very original) & the whole 'the law says I can own a gun but it doesn't say I have to know how to use them' line that is an obvious dig at the lax gun laws in the US. Lets just say George A. Romero need not be worried.Shot in Los Angeles in California the production values are quite good although it's set almost entirely in a strip club which gets repetitive. The make-up & gore effects are pretty good actually & are the sole positive point the film boast's. Porn actress Jenna Jameson makes her theatrical feature film debut here (her current boyfriend Tito Ortiz also has a small role) & she really shouldn't have bothered, a totally talentless actress with big breast's it's clear why she was cast. King of the horror film cameo Robert Englund has a slightly larger role than usual but he's not very good & the rest of the cast are totally unknown to me although a few of the girls do look quite nice. I should also mention Jeannette Sousa as Bereng\u00e9 who puts on the worst Russian accent in cinematic history.Zombie Stripper! is a film that does indeed feature both lots of zombies & lots of strippers, if that sort of thing appeals to you then you may like it but for those looking for a film which a decent story that relies on a plot rather than bare breast's then give this a miss.",

            "content": "I am very open when it comes to movies, I even saw a real God awful movie entitled Evil Bong, and if I remember correctly I gave THAT BS of a movie a better review.I know that for me, I love zombie stuff, I even saw Max Brooks (writer of Zombie Survival Book, and World War Z (which is going to be an actual movie)) when he came to my school. So of course I saw zombies and I was set, but when I saw the strippers I was like, this is going to be interesting, something different, so maybe some originality for a change instead of ripping off Romero. So my review started with an honest 5.Even after the first 10 minutes I knocked that score to a 3, why you might ask? Because even for a B-movie, the acting can be a lot better. But yet it is that none the less, and what should I expect from a movie like this. They even stole lines from other great movies instead of creating their own. The jokes, and well all the dialog are written by people who think they can write because they have taken a few English classes in college. The acting is over done, in other words, you can tell that they are playing a role instead of acting. And most of the time it felt forced. I even played a part in a school zombie movie as a zombie, I could be a better zombie than the extras. To me it seemed like people were forcing their lines. And to top it off, it seems like it was just to give porn stars a slight break into some real acting (which is noble of them but they should make sure they can actually act). The special effects if anything saved it but not much, only in the blood, but granted it isn't Tarantino.Then after about so long I realized that it wasn't getting any better, but worse, everything came predictable, and it was just so dumb, it became a pain in the ass, the acting which was bad got worse, even the story digressed, and failed to reach a climax in my opinion. And this was after 45 minutes.Final thoughts: The people who gave this a good review do one or more of these four things:1. Don't know a good movie2. Don't recognize a good B-movie3. Write good reviews with their dicks4. View that movies that think differently are genius by defaultThis movie goes along with Evil Bong on my C-Movie list \"C\" standing for CRAP!",

Now before you go and watch it, I suggest that you put all the thoughts you have aside thinking that this movie will be similar to any other zombie flick you might have seen. It isn't. This flick is like a weird fetish porno with a comedic twist.In the near future, George Bush has been re-elected, sadly, for a fourth term. The war is still waging on in Iraq and with the US Military out of soldiers, they look to other methods to continue their battle. This just happens to be a zombie virus' that will reanimate the dead and keep them fighting until they decay to nothing. Unfortunately, the test subjects get out of hand and the Z-Squad is sent in to eradicate them. Suddenly one of the soldiers gets bit and finds a way to split out of the quarantine area and into a cozy strip club called \"Rhino's.\" Once inside you get to meet with, Ian (Robert Englund), the club owner and dancer Kit (Jenna Jameson). This is where your money spent, pays off. Kit strides onto the stage slowly taking her clothes off and shortly after you are treated to a boobie parade. Right after the awesome set, Kit is attacked by the Z-Squad now turned zombie. The janitor (Which is the token Beaner and makes for great laughter throughout the film), is told to drag Kit into the backroom, where she transforms into the Undead. Once turned, Kit is back on the stage stripping like she has never stripped before. During her dance, the crowd of perverted college boys are silent and in awe. Until the song ends and they go wild! Ian then has an epiphany, it seems like the Zombie Stripper has made him more money then ever before. So he decides to keep Kit as a dancer and feeds her one horndog a day and leaves the leftovers in the basement. This soon ends up becoming a problem, as with any group of females, Living or Dead, they will always battle for the top spot. Now begins the war of strippers kicking the crap out of each other, zombies eating the living, face sittings, and more janitor beaner jokes.All in all I had come into the movie thinking it's going to be another zombie flick and was left surprised that I could enjoy such a twisted idea of softcore fetish porn.",

Directed and written by one Jay Lee, whom I've never heard of, the movie is as bad as you could wish (or not).The story is simple and is set in a dystopian time, when George W. Bush rules the US, banned all public nudity and plunged the country into a bitter war on several fronts. The lack of soldiers led the US Army to create a virus to restore life to soldiers killed in combat, effectively transforming them into warrior zombies. When things go the worst, a zombie flees to a striptease bar where he manages to infect the local star, a blonde girl who, then, starts doing more and more daring shows, turning the whole business into a success. The owner of the house then decides to infect the other dancers, which will lead to a predictable slaughter.The movie is really bad, and so bad you almost want to laugh. The worst thing about all this is to feel so clearly the desire, on the part of director Lee, to make a cult and popular film. In fact, this is revealing of a certain idiotic pretentiousness that looks bad rather than helps the movie. The story told has no sense or logic, but that was asking too much in such a basic movie, and gore would be better if the effects used weren't as primitive as they are. People are left with no head, no arms, no flesh around their bones, no sexual limb... the film could be an advertisement for a human flesh butcher.The cast is mostly made up of distinguished strangers. The exception is the famous name of Robert Englund, the eternal Freddy Krueger, who appears in this film to give life to the owner of the striptease house and is, by far, the most experienced and capable actor in the cast. The girls in the movie are quite attractive, a sine qua non condition if you imagine the role of stripper, and appear naked, in front, rear, total and partial nudity, during much of the film, which is something that becomes frankly tiring. Jenna Jameson is the most outstanding actress, and we can see her as she came into the world, but that doesn't mean talent, and she is, in fact, a very poor actress.Technically, the movie is decadent. All used effects and cinematography scream \"low budget\" and don't do more than the minimum required, with fake blood looking a lot like that: fake blood. The sets and costumes are good enough, but that's basically what we have.",

During the brouhaha with the undead, Byrdflough, one of the Z- Squad members is bitten. After witnessing the shooting of a lab assistant who is infected, he panics and manages to escape from the facility, ending up at Rhino, an underground strip club. The seedy establishment is run by Ian (Robert Englund) who despises the women and is off-put by their affection toward him, as well as a bit OCD with his can of disinfectant spray. Upon the arrival of an angel-faced newcomer, Jessy, Rhino's most popular dancer, Kat (Jenna Jameson), is attacked and infected by Byrdflough. Competition brews as they see Kat command more money and attention as a zombie stripper. One by one, they succumb to their desire to become one of the undead so that they can steal the spotlight for their own. There isn't too much to say about this gory, sleazy, ham fest. You want boobs? You want zombies? You want porn stars with boobs as zombies? You got it but be warned that the exotic dancing isn't all that titillating (hello, there's a pole there - use it!) until their eyes are sunken in and their flesh is puckered and grey. Even though Jenna Jameson is billed as the main attraction in this film, sexy Shamron Moore outshines her as Kat's bitchy, resentful rival - both in looks and acting. She's prettier, curvier, and doesn't have Botox-injected lips the size of Texas. The film's biggest mistake is smothering us with social and political rhetoric. Please leave that to Michael Moore or Fox News. The satire fails miserably. It's injected into the movie without any thought or concern about who is spewing it, when, how, where, or why. Zombie Strippers! works as a campy blood-and-guts fest but not as some wanna-be philosophical caveat.The decapitations, zombie feasts, limb removals, disembowelments, and other nasty, revolting displays of carnage will have splatter hounds howling with joy.

But of course, some one will find a way to make a movie that either parodies the genre or makes a film similar to the popular ones but with a different premise. And this movie borders along both of those. Unfortunately, from what the title gives its viewers, there's not much to really expect here. If you're a fan of strippers and zombies, then you will love zombie strippers, plain and simple. But for me, it just didn't make sense when it ended.When a medical facility performs experiments to re-animate dead bodies into zombies for the use of super soldiers, it looks like a plan for disaster - in theory and actuality. People already know that re-animated bodies are not controllable, especially when they have a strong appetite for human flesh. How does it sound like they could be used as soldiers efficiently? It's obvious that director and writer Jay Lee is mocking the idea if this were to ever happen, but come on. Some things are better left joked about and not actually made into fruition.After a group of soldiers fights off a hoard of zombies, one of their members is infected. He runs off and hides in a stripper outlet until he fully becomes a zombie. Then he attacks one of the strippers and the rest is apparent. And if that's what you're looking for, you'll have fun. There's plenty of silly and mediocre dialog. The actors aren't that great nor are their characters truly likable, even the ones who play the protagonists. Though maybe Joey Medina who plays the janitor - at least he tried to show charisma. The music provided by TV composer Billy White Acre was garbage too. Barely heard a thing.Of course, because this entire plot revolves around strippers, the eye candy is there. Enough said. Also the special effects such as gunfire was terrible. It didn't look real at all. But what I did find surprising were the practical effects used on the zombies. Specifically for the budget it had, seems almost impossible but they pulled it off so kudos to them. Other than that, it's not worth the time for a zombie film. One is better off watching an actual George A. Romero film, which is the true definition of a zombie film.A parody of sorts a long with bad writing, acting and shoddy special effects make this zombie film tough to sit through.

            "content": "I just saw this, thinking it was your average zombie movie with some porn. No. AMAZING Zombie movie. Some of the best special effects and most creative death scene of any to rival Romero. Discounting the rest of the film, evaluated on the zombie/gore aspects it is one of the the best zombie movies, EVER! The rest of one's opinion depends on 1) are you a man (or lesbian) and 2) do you like heavy music. The movie has quite a bit of titage and R-rated strippage, and well as some good, heavy music (lets call it hardcore/metal). As minor side note, depending on your political affiliate you will either like or hate the political diatribe at the beginning and end. Even hating it, I LOVE THIS MOVIE !!!-ISD RIP",

I was definitely entertained and amused throughout. The viewer gets to see just how far a strip club owner(in a time where strip clubs are illegal) goes to make the money. the gore is good. Some of the effects were a little cheesy. But overall it was awesome. The opening sequence will surely get a laugh. The dialog really was better than what I expected. Most of it anyway. I think Jenna Jameson should stick to porn, but that's just my $.02. I only gave this an eight for one reason, and one reason alone. Decomposing boobs are pretty icky looking. I would totally watch it again, maybe even buy it for my collection.",

I really enjoyed the political satire - Bush in his 4th term as president, now that's a horror story). The makeup and gore effects, even the digital ones are really good. And there's plenty of T&A and full frontal nudity. There is some genuinely funny slapstick and it's probably the best zombie comedy since Night of the Living Dead. B rate horror yes, but there's not much low budget about it. Again for what it is I can't really say one bad thing about it. Well yes I can. It's not 1% scary and I usually like some scare with my horror even if it is a comedy. But it makes up for that with some truly shocking gore moments.",

            "content": "The government has been working on an experiment that would revive fallen soldiers, making them into superhuman killing machines. One gets out and heads to an underground strip club (since its the future and stripping is illegal), and infects lead dancer Kat (Jenna Jameson).The difference between men and women is that when men are turned into these zombies, they become mindless killing machines. Women, on the other hand, are pretty much the same as they were before, except their senses are heightened.Soon all the strippers want to be zombies, because the men love the zombies. And then an all-out war happens, and who will survive? What I appreciated the most about this film is the ability for it to make fun of itself. It was cheesy, campy, and downright horrible...but it knew it. It didn't try to be a serious film, but just had fun with itself. That being said, it was still a horrendous piece of trash that should never have been made, but at least it made fun of itself.",

            "content": "I loved this movie. This came out on DVD just as I finished reading the play 'Rhinoceros' for a class. Let me tell you, this is not \"supposedly\" or \"allegedly\" based on this play, it is FOR SURE based on this play, and it has to be one of the most bad-ass adaptations I ever did see. It is indisputable that Jay Lee (writer, director) knew what he was doing when he adapted the smart and absurd play about Nazism taking over French townspeople like a flu, and that's part of what makes this movie so great! There are layers of social commentary in this movie and maybe they are not as poignant as they were in Europe 50 years ago, but nobody was shooting golf balls out of vagina's back then so it all works out. When I brought this up to my class (how could I not share this gem of a coincidence?), it raised some eyebrows and lowbrow laughs and then a week later this guy a couple seats away attested to it even stronger than I did. THE POINT OF THIS REVIEW IS TO GET YOU TO READ 'RHINOCEROS' BY EUGENE IONESCO (it's only like 90 pages) AND THEN WATCH 'ZOMBIE STRIPPERS!' AGAIN!. IT WILL SHED A WHOLE NEW MEANINGFUL LIGHT ONTO THIS INSANELY FUNNY AND (despite that all I've been saying is that this is an adaptation of something else) ORIGINAL MOVIE.",

It is done as a total joke, but there is some good political satire, video game gore, and at times comic book styled visuals. I'm still giving it a 10 because this is an underrated movie and it deserve some attention. Be prepared for strip club scenes to punctuate the movie, and skip them if offended by that for a good short film. But watch and laugh if nothing else. And you'll be glad you did. But only if you have a brain, Zombie Strippers sums it up. You will see Jenna Jameson acting like a stripper, but still doing some acting and even a Zombie Stripper vs Zombie Stripper fight. Robert Englund is a strip club owner in 2012 when they are outlawed and plays a pretty twisted character which he does with style. But be sure pay attention to the beginning news cast, sorry you'll need to read. But watch this movie and enjoy the fact that it is not to far off from everyday America.",

She was, for awhile, perhaps the prettiest girl in the book. Back then the mainstream girlie magazines were downright wholesome compared to 2008. Jenna's on-camera wee-wee scene might have been thought of as far-out; today they do hard-core with girls having simultaneous intercourse with 2 men, while also having oral sex with man #3. My wildest dream, NOT!, is having two other guys having sex with the girl I'm having sex with.....but anyway. Jenna is the main draw here, and a good draw she ain't. After 17 years of abusive living, and repulsive cosmetic surgery, she's a pathetic shadow of the pretty girl born in Las Vegas in 1974, the pretty one getting started in Swank in 1992.",

It gives it a charming feel that can make all the difference.Make it self-aware and have the characters practically mugging at the camera, then it loses it's humor and that's what we have here.I got this for $5.00 based on the title alone. How bad could it be? It has Robert Englund and Jenna Jameson so we have horror cred and stripper cred in the same place. I couldn't have been more disappointed. I was expecting a shlocky film based on the title but instead I got something else.The problem for me was the they had a great idea but didn't do anything with it. A stripper gets turned into a zombie because some scientists have created a virus and yada yada yada Resident Evil. But this virus somehow makes her supa sexy and all the guys in the place are going wild for her. Really? That's the catch? She's somehow become a better dancer because of this but honestly it looks the same as it was before? And because of this the other girls decide to become zombies as well because they don't want her stealing their tips.And that's it. There's not much else to the plot. I mean sure the women are good looking enough and Robert Englund is always fun but there just wasn't enough here. And honestly I just got bored.",

Rhino's is the underground strip club of choice for men in search of some small- town excitement, and when one of the dancers is infected with the deadly virus, she quickly becomes the most popular dancer around.

Based on an Existentialist story, there is more here than meets the eye and I'm not just talking about boobies. There are lots of boobies though, but Sartre! The Good: The good to be found in Zombie Strippers! is the humor. It has tons of political and social satire but the goofy camp-style of the film keeps it from ever taking itself too seriously. This is exactly the kind of film that people should watch in a drunken group, which is no doubt what the filmmakers intended. Zombie Strippers! is fun, stupid, and enjoyable. Any attempt to take it seriously will ruin the magic. Plus, there's undead strippers crawling around on stage. What more could you want from a film? The Bad: Dialogue, acting, costumes, lighting, camera work, acting, story, acting - these things are all beyond bad in Zombie Strippers! but no more so than any pr0n you've ever seen and this movie is actually funny. The special effects look strictly consumer Adobe level but that's not important with a farce - in fact, it adds to it. Besides, there are boobies and zombies. See what I mean? The Ugly: This movie is goofy-licious and fun! No need to besmirch it with heavy-handed cinema critique and anonymous criticism. No one meant for it to be Citizen Kane; it's supposed to be every bit of ridiculous as it actually is. Just enjoy the damn thing! Boobies, zombies.Old School: Old school horror fans will probably dig Zombie Strippers! It's the kind of stupid horror spoof that makes a good lead-in for the seriously scary films later on in the night, like Glitter.New Blood: Steal some alcohol, dl this and have fun.To See or Not to See? Rent, buy, pirate or con? You may as well buy it because it actually is fun to watch. Not like Edward D.Wood, Jr. film funny, but more like MST3K funny - or maybe a little bit of both. Enjoy this movie! (boobies, zombies)",
