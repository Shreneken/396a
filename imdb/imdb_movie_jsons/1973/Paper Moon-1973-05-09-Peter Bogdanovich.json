            "content": "Unlike many films of the early 1970s, plenty before and after, viewing this doesn't continually remind you of the time of its creation, but instead deposits you into the age of the Great Depression where your mind resides for the duration.The development of the relationship between Moses and Addie is near perfect, their capers, scrapes and mischief endearingly conjuring a bond they both desperately need. I didn't expect this to be anything like as engrossing, charming and engaging as it was, perhaps being the father of two daughters with attitude enhanced the experience, but whatever it was left a lasting impression.",

            "review_title": "A terrific film on all levels",
            "content": "Paper Moon has to be one of the finest pieces of American cinema to grace the 70's. Bogdanovich's direction bares a strong resemblance to The Last Picture Show, but overall this film is much more satisfying and enjoyable. The Black and White photography gives the film a nostalgic beauty that perfectly complements the Depression-era it attempts to recreate. Also notable is the charming Jazz-based score, with a wonderful opening title track, reinforcing the film's charm. As good as the story, direction and music are however, the true stars of the film are the O'Neal twosome. Both bring forth their best performances of their careers, and share a chemistry on screen that only a father and daughter could. Ryan O'Neal brings forth a subtle charm as the wise-talking, but inept hustler Moses Pray. Tatum however, even upstages her father with what has to be the best youth performance in history. She is funny and moving when need be, and always charming, eliciting laughs many times based solely on her malleable facial expressions. Her show-stopping five minute shot, no matter how long it took to film, proves just how fully Tatum was able to embody little Addie Pray. The movie is always entertaining, with never a dull spot, with a strong supporting performance by Madeline Kahn to help keep things rolling during the middle. This is a true classic that should be seen by people of all ages, I can't recommend it enough!",

            "content": "True, TATUM O'NEIL won an Oscar for her role as Addie Pray in PAPER MOON and fully deserved it. Her dad, RYAN O'NEIL must have been proud of her but his only reward was a Golden Globe nomination.The con artist and little girl theme had been used before in Damon Runyon's famous comedy \"Little Miss Marker\" with Shirley Temple and Adolphe Menjou. But here the twist is that the girl is just as much a con artist as the man--and that's the key that makes the film so much more palatable for 1970s audiences without getting too sentimental about it.There's a real Depression-era feeling to the whole story, with some richly detailed panoramas of rural America and its citizens at that time in history. Peter Bogdanovich has done a commendable job in making sure that his authentic backgrounds illuminate an enchanting tale about two drifters who share an unusual partnership when it becomes clear to the man that the girl would be a valuable aid in his con work.There's a bright supporting role by MADELINE KAHN as Trixie Delight, a stripper who tosses off some good one-liners, but it's the chemistry between Tatum and Ryan that turns this into the most satisfying \"buddy\" movie of the '70s.Summing up: A treat not to be missed.",

            "review_title": "PAPER MOON refuses to cry.",
            "content": "PAPER MOON is one of those films which refuses to age or become dated, because, as director Peter Bogdanovich claims, it was dated when it was released.  It has the look and presence of a film from the Golden Thirties with the panache and style that could only come from the Golden Seventies. That extraordinary decade when the Old Hollywood Studio Machine was being rapidly replaced by the rise of the Artist Filmmaker, who were young, eager and just out of film school.  A wonderful period of flux when anything could and did happen.  A seminal period in filmmaking where new artists were making important new films, which would change Hollywood forever. PAPER MOON is outwardly a period road picture set in the mid 30s, about a traveling man named Moze Pray (Ryan O'Neil) who will play any angle if it means a couple of extra dollars in his pocket.  As the story opens he agrees to escort the daughter of a now deceased lover to her Aunt in Missouri. Slick Moze quickly meets his match in the half pint tough little Addie Loggins (Ryan's real life daughter Tatum in her first role).  No sentimental tear jerker here, this is a great story which refuses to go down the obvious road of a father reunited with his lost little girl; we aren't even sure it's really his daughter.  Little Addie is tough as nails at every turn and a whole lot more savvy than Moze could ever be.  At turn after turn she will outsmart and outmaneuver Moze in a way which is a sheer delight to watch. Tatum O'Neil gives an Oscar caliber performance as little Addie, but why she was given a Best Supporting Actress award and not nominated for the Best Actress category, one can only wonder.  Madeline Kahn (What's Up Doc, Blazing Saddles), in her second film ever also delivers the goods as Miss Trixie Delight who meets up with the pair and sees her own angle. Everyone is playing some angle in this film and we get to enjoy every minute of it.Shot completely on locations in Kansas and Missouri PAPER MOON sparkles with a richness only capable in black and white.  Cinematographer Lazlo Kovacs is a great camera artist and never better than PAPER MOON where he uses black and white, deep focus and those great long takes to its best advantage. To the untrained eye it will just appear very sharp, but look closely at each frame and notice that everything is in tack sharp focus from the closest object to far in the distance.  This deep focus is very difficult to achieve correctly, especially in the night shots, but Kovacs does it so well it is seamless.  Watch for the train station sequence where even the children playing in the background are razor sharp.  This is a look that can only be achieved using black and white to its fullest potential.  New filmmakers take notice.  This is how it's supposed to be done. All this cinematic brilliance would be wasted were it not for the wonderful direction of Bogdanovich. In this his third film, he proves that he is a consummate filmmaker who knows how to move the actors and camera in perfect concert.  His craftsmanship of each scene is unmistakable as he brings a fresh and very new approach using Hollywood tricks which are decades old. A lesser director might have used process shots and sets to tell the story, but not Bogdanovich.  He shot the entire film in real locations to give it the look and feel of a real thirties road picture.  You can almost smell the wide plains and feel the dust as it comes up to slap you in the face. Notice too how he never resorts to sentimentality to move the story along, it is told razor sharp and without tears.  This, never more apparent than the final sequence where he pays off the film in grand style.There is only one thing about this film which still baffles me.  Why in the night time hotel sequence toward the end of the film were electric lights everywhere but inside the hotel lobby, which was lit entirely with kerosine lamps? Was it to give the look and feel of the period, or did the real location use them? Small point, but interesting. If, like myself, the last time you saw PAPER MOON was when it was released in 1973, see it again on DVD and be delighted all over again.  The DVD transfer is marvelous and only serves to heighten its visual appeal.  If you have only seen PAPER MOON on broadcast TV, do yourself a favor and see the new DVD for a pleasant surprise.  Without the obligatory broadcast TV commercials, pan and scan and dialogue cuts this will appear like a new film seen the way it was supposed to be seen.  And if you have NEVER seen PAPER MOON and harbor some prejudice against black and white films, please see this film.  Any preconceived notions against this format will quickly dissolve as it takes you along for a rich ride with Addie and Moze in the only format it could - glorious black and white.",

The acting is wonderful (Ryan O'Neal was never better), the cinematography is exceptional and it's to the eternal credit of director Bogdanovich and his writer Alvin Sargeant that the caper never sinks into mushiness. By avoiding the earnestness that pervades so many Depression Era tales and perfectly balancing character with situation, it rolls along so merrily that you don't realise how touching it is until the very end.Having (criminally) never seen Paper Moon before, I suspect that it must have had more than a passing influence on a great many other movies, including my all-time favourite Midnight Run. Watching it is an experience to be savoured and treasured, and one that I'm looking forward to repeating time and again.",

Set in Depression era Kansas, it is story of the relationship between Addie, a smart talking 7 year old, and Moses, a bible selling con man who might be her father. The on screen chemistry between Ryan and Tatum O'Neal is fantastic. Madeline Kahn is great as a side show floosey they pick up along the way and she almost steals the show! Filmed in Kansas and Missouri, director Peter Bogdonavich used local people in cameo roles which adds to the authentic feel of the film. Also to the director's credit, this film may be one the best to portray 1930's America. All in all, Paper Moon is full of great characters and a fine story line. On a personal note, I saw this film with my 90 year old grandmother and she laughed throughout the film and said it was one the best films she ever saw. That's not a bad recomendation coming from someone born in 1883!",

            "content": "A sunny charmer with clouds enough to darken the edges of the screen, \"Paper Moon\" presents us with an entertainment of equal parts wit and sentiment, an underdog story that delivered a real underdog outcome in the form of a historic Oscar win for nine-year- old Tatum O'Neal.In the time of the Great Depression, a little girl named Addie (Tatum) is left abandoned by the death of her mother, a woman who hung around in bars and left Addie with a big mystery as far as the identity of her father is concerned. At her gravesite, a dodgy stranger named Moses (Ryan O'Neal) happens by to pay his respects, and is immediately recruited by the other mourners, who don't want to be burdened with the girl, with the assignment of delivering Addie to her next-of-kin.\"God works in mysterious ways,\" one of the mourners says, after Moses reluctantly accepts.\"Don't He now?\" Moses replies.God indeed may have some unfinished business with Moses Pray, a conman who uses the Good Book as his device for fleecing newly-made widows of a few bucks. Watching the O'Neals work their family chemistry for sparks and laughs while Moses, with unexpected help from Addie, works his scams, is great fun. A lingering question is whether Moses and Addie are in fact related; many in the movie point out their similar jawlines, but Moses refuses to accept the idea. Addie is more open to it. Clearly Moses for all his faults fills a hole in her life.There was a time when Peter Bogdanovich could do no wrong as a director; here he presents us with an assured callback to 1930s- period sensibilities by employing a flat Kansas landscape and scenic design that suggests a combination of Norman Rockwell and Grant Wood, at once homey and vaguely grotesque. The story moves fast, the dialogue is crisp and believable, and the O'Neals' performances of such strong quality as to make you wonder why they so seldom impressed in other roles. The talent is there on the screen.Tatum was the real surprise here; decades later, long after the flash of her career faded, it's hard not to be as bowled over by what she gives you as all those critics and movie-goers were so long ago. Avoiding the cutesiness of child actors, she plays her character as sharp-tongued and vinegary, with a hint of real beauty beneath the smudges. \"Ain't she got a sweet little face, somehow,\" is the best anyone can manage in the way of compliments, but Addie don't need them. She just wants her 200 dollars, or \"two hundra DOLLA\" as she keeps putting it to Moses.The two of them make such a pair I get annoyed when Madeline Kahn joins them for a time as a conniving, cheapjack vixen named Trixie. Unlike the O'Neals, Kahn is an actress I usually enjoy in anything, so why is she so duff to me here? Trixie is a one-note performance that grates on me; I can't wait for the Prays to leave her in their dust.I did enjoy P. J. Johnson as Trixie's put-upon maid, Imogene. She adds some heart and gives Addie some company for some of the movie's best scenes. So too does a raft of supporting players, most of whom like Kahn must have been waiting for Mel Brooks' call-backs for \"Blazing Saddles\" at the time of this production.Mostly, though, this is Tatum's film; it rises or falls with her and, as a result of her spry performance, rises quite impressively. Bogdanovich clearly gambled putting his promising career on her little shoulders; unlike later gambles of his this paid off spectacularly and yields dividends to this day.",

            "content": "Paper Moon (1973)Utterly charmed and charming. The story of a father and daughter--the actor and actress O'Neal--echoes the story in the story of a man and a little girl on the road. Yes, they scam and cheat, but they do it with relative innocence. And they are perfectly adorable. The magic between the two is partly good writing, and partly the ease that the two actors already have (or pretend to have) together.And it's filmed with nostalgic black and white clarity, perfect in a way for the Depression era it portrays, but much more alive and clean than the deep brooding intensity of a real Depression story such as the 1940 Grapes of Wrath. But Peter Bogdanovich is no John Ford, and this is a different kind of tale, with the 1930s as backdrop to a more modern kind of relationship. It has enough subtlety and laughs to make it a classic and a joy. Nothing obviously deep, but yet it sinks in farther than you think.",

            "content": "Utterly delightful. Father and daughter Ryan and Tatum O'Neal, under Peter Bogdanovich's superlative direction, produce one of the most affectingly warm and cunningly sly movies of the 1970s. Set in depression era America and beautifully photographed in pristine monochrome by Laszlo Kovacs, it's a period piece that refuses to get old, such is the deft imagery and sharpness of the screenplay.Story essentially comes down to conman Moses Pray (R. O'Neal) hooking up with orphan Addie Loggins (T. O'Neal), who may or may not be his actual daughter. Addie proves to be a precocious live wire, not easily fooled and she smokes, cusses and is more than capable of pulling a con herself. After initial indignation, Moses comes to court Addie's strengths and they form a dynamic partnership as they travel through Kansas, pulling cons left right and centre and piling the money up. But can it last forever?The chemistry between father and daughter is obviously set in stone, with young Tatum an absolute revelation. The screenplay gives them both ample opportunities to enchant and amuse the viewer as they get up to all sorts of tricks and scrapes. Yet there's always that feeling hanging in the dusty air that something has to give, that we are treading firmly in bittersweet territory, the crafty couple having earned our complete investment in their well being keeping us concerned even as we laugh out loud.Delightful. 9/10",

The director of this movie is Peter Bogdonavich and he really put together a masterpiece of nostalgic film making. Paper Moon is a classic comedy drama, that resembles the films of John Ford or Sam Wood. Ryan O' Neal in his best performance, stars as Moses pray a con man who sells bibles to recent widows meets up with Addie Loggins played by Academy Award Winner Tatum O'Neal who is wonderful. The cinematography is beautifully crafted. The landscapes and roads of St. Louis and other cities are so expertly filmed. The black and white photography, would make todays audiences think this film was released in 1933 not 30 years after in 1973. Now 32 years later this film holds up and stands the test of time. I don't want to give too much away, I am sure many of the readers here have seen it. The supporting cast is great John Hillerman in 2 roles a bootlegger and his brother, who is a sheriff. Then you have Randy Quaid and Burton Gilliam in smaller roles. P.j. Johnson is hysterical as the maid to Miss Trixie Delight played with such zest by th greatest comic actress of the 20th century the late and great Madeline Kahn. She stole the film. She was nominated for an Oscar for supporting actress and lost out to you know who. I think she should have gotten it, because her role really was supporting and also for a small role around 20 minutes with few close-ups she gave such a tarnished performance. She makes you laugh so hard and yet is so heartbreakingly touching in her big scene on the hill with Addie. If this film was actually made in the 30's Moses could have been played by maybe James Stewart, James Cagney, Henry Fonda or John Garfied. Addie could have been played by Shirley Temple and Trixie maybe have been played by Sylvia Sidney, Betty Field or Ann Sheridan. But I don't think they could have played them any better than Ryan O'Neal, Tatum O'Neal and most especially Madeline Kahn.",

            "content": "Peter Bogdanovich directs \"Paper Moon\", a film which, like his 1971 flick \"The Last Picture Show\", works best as both an evocation of the past and a love-letter to John Ford. The film's cinematography, by Laszlo Kovac, dazzles.The plot: Ryan O'Neal plays a con artist struggling to make a living in rural Kansas (and Missouri) during the Great Depression. He meets a tough, adaptable little girl, played by Tatum O'Neal, who may or may not be his illegitimate daughter. The bickering duo go on the road together, conning anyone they can out of easy money.The film's a nice little adventure, bouncy, funny, swift and pleasing, but one can't escape how lightweight it all is. Bogdanovich's film is less about an era than it is a cosy resurrection of an era's cinematic tropes and artifacts, the director lingering on period details with the loving gaze of an antique salesman.Still, the film never pretends to be anything other than a comedy, Bogdanovich does acknowledge the presence and subjugation of blacks (something which most of the early Great Depression films \u2013 think Chaplin's Tramp movies \u2013 didn't do) and he captures the adaptability, intuitiveness and resourcefulness people of the era needed in order to stay afloat. The film's unresolved relationship between Ryan and Tatum is also interesting: she's his offspring in real life, but are they related in the film? Is his fondness for her paternal or selfishly pragmatic? Is their relationship designed to say something about the era (hard times makes everyone blood?)? The film was part of a wave of gambling and con-man movies, all of which were released in the early 1970s (\"Paper Moon\", \"California Split\", \"Thieves Like Us\", \"Bad Company\", \"Hard Times\", \"The Sting\" etc). These films pushed Hollywood's previous huckster wave (\"Butch Cassidy\", \"The Hustler\", \"Get To Know Your Rabbit\", \"The Cincinnati Kid\") into more cynical, detached territory. To stay alive, they said, one has to be above morality, have no moral scruples, and be willing to cheat. The heroes of these films are not beaten, and do not go out in the previous decades' blazes of glory, but instead continue onwards in their scheming, which is often shown to be hollow and soul destroying. It's a more inward form of self destruction best seen in Altman's films of this era, which charter the decade's shift from anger and outrage to apathy and selfishness; everyone else does it, so I'll suck it up and play the game as well. This wave ended with the dethroning of Richard Nixon in 1974. With the release of \"Jaws\" in 75, the zeitgeist changed completely. Everyone was now a shark and nobody knew it.8.5/10 \u2013 Worth one viewing.",

            "content": "Nine-year-old Addie Loggins is the centerpiece of Peter Bogdanovich's affectionate 1973 comedy set during the depths of the Great Depression. The filmmaker was on a roll at the time as he made the coming-of-age saga, 1971's \"The Last Picture Show\", and the screwball throwback, 1972's \"What's Up, Doc?\", in quick succession. Cineaste that he is, Bogdanovich filmed this episodic, character-driven comedy deliberately in black and white, inspired by classics as diverse as Charlie Chaplin's \"The Kid\", Vittorio de Sica's \"Bicycle Thieves\" and even John Ford's \"The Searchers\". The result is charming if a bit overlong for the simple story being told. As the film opens in Kansas, Addie just lost her mother, and she is to be taken to live with relatives in Missouri. Enter traveling Bible salesman Moses Pray, a small-time grifter who bilks recent widows out of cash under the pretense that their late husbands had ordered personalized Bibles before their deaths. As a chronic womanizer, he knew Addie's free-living mother and promises to take her to her relatives after he extorts $200 from a local business owner.The rest of the story is an entertaining road movie centered on the evolving relationship between Moses and Addie as she shows to have a greater gift for scams than he does. A tough-talking smoker who loves radio, Addie is a tomboy frequently mistaken for a boy, while Moses constantly resists his paternal feelings toward her even though they are kindred spirits. Complications occur first with the appearance of a tawdry carnival stripper named Trixie Delight, who threatens to come between Moses and Addie, and then with a bootlegger and his look-alike sheriff brother, who are in hot pursuit over a scam around crates of illegal whiskey. As Addie, Tatum O'Neal still has the distinction of being the youngest actor to win a competitive Oscar, and in her film debut, her unprecocious performance reflects refreshingly confident work from a child. Perhaps fearful that his daughter was stealing the movie, a well-founded fear it turns out, her father Ryan does some of his best screen work as Moses, better cast here than as bumbling musicologist Howard Bannister in \"What's Up, Doc?\".As she proved with her hilarious portrayal of Howard's persnickety fianc\u00e9e Eunice in \"What's Up, Doc?\", Madeline Kahn is an unparalleled scene-stealer as Trixie, especially as she tries to coax a belligerent Addie off a grassy hilltop. Just before peaking in Mel Brooks' farces and reunited with the elder O'Neal, Kahn shows what she can do to maximize less than half-hour of screen time. Almost as funny is the eye-rolling cynicism of P.J. Johnson as Trixie's indentured servant Imogene. The 2003 DVD has two substantial extras. First, Bogdanovich offers a full-length commentary full of his personal remembrances and sharing a deep well of cinematic knowledge. The second is Laurent Bouzereau's \"The Making of Paper Moon\", an exhaustive making-of featurette divided into three parts, which covers all aspects of the film's development and production and includes comments from Bogdanovich, his then-wife Polly Platt who did the production design, cinematographer L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, and producer Frank Marshall.",

            "content": "Paper Moon shows us a simpler time, those Depression Era Thirties. In those days everyone was scratching for a dollar some less honestly than others like Ryan O'Neal. He plays a conman whose current scam is being a Bible salesman. Now could there be anything dishonest about a salesman of the Good Book? I won't describe his con, but it's a good one and in Middle America, Kansas of the Thirties, there's lots of suckers ready to be trimmed in this kind of scheme.But O'Neal gets a call on route that a woman he was intimately acquainted with has died. The 10 year old child she left behind could very well be O'Neal's.Ryan only agrees to deliver the girl to an aunt in St. Joseph, Missouri, but real life daughter Tatum kind of grows on him. And she certainly has his conning ways which would convince anyone she really is his daughter. She aids and abets him and comes up with some schemes of her own. Especially one involving Madeline Kahn who is a woman of some easy virtue who Ryan takes up with and Tatum can no way see as a mother figure.Paper Moon with its great musical score of 30s standards is my kind of film for that alone. But with real life father and daughter playing father and daughter on screen there's a special dimension for those really sublime and quality scenes. It's what earned Paper Moon it's Oscar for Tatum O'Neal as Best Supporting Actress. Doubly impressive since Madeline Kahn was also nominated. Paper Moon was also nominated for Best Sound and for Adapted Screenplay.In the cast you will really be surprised at John Hillerman's portrayal of a mean and corrupt redneck sheriff. It is such a far cry from being Higgins on Magnum, PI, Hillerman carries it off so well.I doubt in this day and age that Tatum and Ryan could have had the happy ending they did, but that's probably for the better. Still Paper Moon is nice nostalgic film about some less than honorable people.",

There is not much required of the viewer here but whereas in similar circumstances there might have been a possibility of me dropping off, this has sufficient charm and humour to keep things moving along rather nicely. Tatum O'Neal is remarkable and whilst I realise there were many takes for certain scenes for a nine-year-old to appear so confident and emotive is remarkable. Ryan also does well, especially as his time is probably split between concentrating on his own performance and that of his daughter. Madeline Kahn is a welcome addition to the cast with a sparkling extended cameo halfway through. Extremely well made and enjoyable film that does not outstay its welcome.",

The last one puts an interesting spin on things. I remember when I saw it, I had just seen \"The Sting\" and noticed that the two both dealt with conning. But boy do they have something in store for you here.The movie opens with Bible salesman Moses Pray (Ryan O'Neal) adopting Addie Loggins (Tatum O'Neal) in a Midwestern town during the Great Depression. It doesn't take her long to figure out that the guy's a con artist. However, she turns out to be cleverer than he.I remember hearing about how the novel (which I've never read) was simply called \"Addie Pray\", and didn't feature the scene in which Moses and Addie sit on the title object at the fair. It's debatable as to whether or not it changed the quality to add that object and change the title. But either way, you can't deny that this movie remains a timeless masterpiece. Personally, I think that Peter Bogdanovich deserves a lot more credit as a director than most people give him; he has made some really good movies, even if some came out a little lower than we expect. This one is just great.Also starring Madeleine Kahn and Randy Quaid.",

Ryan was never more relaxed or likable in a role, maybe because he was working with his daughter.

But Paper Moon is something else, a hybrid of crime comedy and maybe a family drama. It starts with 9-year-old Addie at her mother's funeral, where she meets a friend of her mother, the con man Moses Pray. Moze gets $200 for Addie in compensation for her mom's death, then blows half of it on a new car for himself. The film begins to pick up and become very funny when the little girl demands her money back, showing herself worldly and forceful for her age- likely a product of being raised by a \"loose\" woman. Addie also suspects Moze may be her dad, which he denies- after a long pause, indicating he either knows he is or believes it's possible.What we have from here is an unusual (maybe) father-daughter story, in which the two bond, but never in a sweet and sugary way. They don't get sentimental- instead, she picks up Moze's tricks and joins in the fun, making his con jobs more equitable by sparing the impoverished and getting more out of the rich. They're on the wrong side of the law, but in their own way, each does have scruples. In the end, Addie is offered a sweet and sugary life in a comfortable home- and doesn't want it, because she prefers life with Moze, because she isn't perfect and doesn't want perfect, and the audience can feel that's who she is and can understand.Paper Moon slows down a little in the middle, when Madeline Kahn comes into the picture and Moze and Addie mess with a bootlegger. But in my view, the big payoff comes when they're arrested and pull off an extremely clumsy escape. It's a good laugh, and adds to Paper Moon's many charms.",

This film was curiously nostalgic, somehow driving me to reminisce back to a time where I wasn't even born! Only the greatest filmmakers are able to capture a moment and make that moment timeless. That's what separates movies from cinematic masterpieces. \"Paper Moon\" had a plethora of those timeless moments.The casting of real-life father and daughter, Ryan and Tatum O'Neal, was right on the ball. Tatum O'Neal's performance as Addie Loggins was exceptional. As child actors go, she remains one of Hollywood's most cherished nearly fifty years later.

            "content": "Again, I came back to this film via Karina Longworth's highly recommended podcast \"You Must Remember This\", whose most recent series focused on Polly Platt, credited with the production design on this movie, but, as Longworth convincingly claims, was probably responsible for far more in the production. Not only was she still officially Mrs Peter Bogdanovich at the time, although separated from him after the director's affair with Cybill Shepherd, she reportedly assisted with the script, location choices and probably most importantly, suggested Tatum O'Neal for the part of Addie. Not that I'm denigrating too much Bogdanovich's role as the accredited director, as the film is beautifully assembled, with stunning black and white cinematography, beautifully played out scenes and great performances from his cast.Here Bogdanovich goes back even further into monochrome Americana than the ossified post-WW2 Texas of \"The Last Picture Show\" which made his name, arriving at Depression-Era Missouri where we encounter confidence trickster Moses Pray, who peddles a neat line in hoodwinking the families of the recently bereaved into buying marked-up Bibles. He's just missed attending the funeral of an old flame, recently knocked down and killed by a speeding car, but is soon talked into driving the late woman's nine-year-old, tight-lipped orphan daughter Addie (Tatum O'Neal) to the train station and putting her on a train to live with her aunt. The young girl thinks maybe this guy's her real dad, who she never knew, so she willingly tags along with him. The first thing he promptly does is use her to extort $200 from the offending driver's car, which in the end only gives Addie the excuse to hang around with him a bit longer.Well, now we're well and truly on the road of this \"road\" movie, for a series of highly amusing flim-flamming misadventures, which variously take in a neat con in a drug-store, an encounter with good-time girl Trixie Delight (the ever-amusing Madeline Kahn) and her misused young black maid and finally a more serious run-in with a bootlegger and his cop brother. It all ends up in a race to the border for their own safety and you won't be surprised to learr the final outcome after Mose has finally carried out his errand of leaving Addie at her aunt's.The film, like all of Bogdanovich's main features is a homage to Hollywood past, Preston Sturges' brilliant \"Sullivan's Travels\" comes most readily to mind but of course the superb deep-focus camerawork alone recalls his great heroes Ford, Hawks and Welles. He skilfully avoids overdoing the sentiment and is quite expert at getting fine performances from all his cast. Young Tatum O'Neal walks away with her every scene, but to do so she needs her old man to play the thankless task of straight man, which he does excellently.This was the last film on which Bogdanovich worked with Platt and coincidentally or not, the last time he was acclaimed for any of his fitful film output from here, unwittingly ploughing the same sometimes barren landscape of his great idol Welles.Here, he's undoubtedly made a unique film, certainly for its time, beautifully balancing humour and pathos in a real dust-bowl delight.",

            "content": "Peter Bogdanovich' \"Paper Moon\", delivers a beautiful story with an authentic artistry and a delightful capacity to surprise you. I insist on the surprise element, because nothing is to be taken for granted: when you expect a road-movie made of episodic cons, the plot immerses you in the father-and-daughter duo played by Ryan O'Neal and his daughter Tatum, and when you expect the film to evolve on more melodramatic fields, it never betrays its inner comedic spirit.\"Paper Moon\" has the perfect dosage of comedy and drama, never too sappy or too syrupy, it doesn't fall in the trap of gratuitous slapstick either although it had all the ingredients. This is because Bogdanovich, aware of the enormous potential of a real father-and-daughter duo, lets the emotional core of \"Paper Moon\" rely on the relationship rather than the girl who's the central character of the original novel (titled 'Addie Pray'). The film's main delight comes from the evolution of the relationship between Moze and Addie, from animosity to partnership, and from partnership to complicity. The comical aspect is conveyed by their reciprocal denial, Moze only takes Addie with him because he promised to send her to a relative in St. Jo but he doesn't admit she's his daughter, although she does have his wits, his gifts, his jaw and even seem to outsmart him in his own business. Addie, on the other hand, is toughened by the loss of her mother and doesn't want to leave Moze until he gives her the 200$ he took from the man who accidentally killed his mother, a money he spent on his own car repairs. They both con people and live together without enjoying it, using an old clich\u00e9, it's all business and never personal.The Depression Era offers a rather suitable atmosphere for the movie because it was precisely a period of disillusions where people could easily be conned, something that echoes the spirit of the movie \"The Sting\", released the same year. Moze and Addie were making business through 'victimless' crimes, (the biggest victims were never 'by essence' innocent people). The first con consisted on selling to widows a Bible supposedly ordered by their late husbands they died, it seems heartless when you look at it, but Addie does add a sense of professionalism, raising the prices according to the prey's face and sometimes even giving them a break. The team works formidably and manage to appeal to us because they have ethics, and succeed in very fascinating tricks, especially the way they confuse cashier clerks, the first act efficiently builds the partnership while enlightening us on the fascinating methods of how to confuse a cashier clerk, some cons are so clever that it's hard to get the first time, and then we know we'd fall into them. And as the first act ends with a car going in a dust of sand, we know they're partners.The second act consolidates the relationship by elevating it into a love triangle with a dancer named Trixie Delight, played by a scene-stealer Madeline Kahn. Addie must seat in the back of the car with Imogene (P.J. Johnson) Trixie's black maid. The second part has a sort of vaudeville feel that combines the wit of \"The Sting\" with a subtle poignancy. Addie uses her talent to have 'her man' back, this man who didn't want to be photographed with her on the paper moon during the infamous carnival where he met Trixie. The way she succeeds and manage to help Imogene at the same time so she can leave Trixie is not overplayed, and the conclusion is almost sad because we somewhat got used to Trixie and her irresistible pronunciation of 'bone structure' and Imogene who knows she'll never see them again. The second act ends with the car leaving under a pouring rain, and Moze and Addie together 'on the road', partners again, with something else probably tickling their hearts.The third act takes a dramatic but indispensable turn allowing the duo to overlook their hostility and start working together. It involves an elaborated and clever scheme against a bootlegger and the attempt to escape from his angry brother who \u2013unfortunately- happens to be the cop (both played by the same actor). This part gets the movie back to its starting point because Moze is broken (not just physically) which coincides with their arrival in St. Jo. Addies goes to her aunt's house and Moze to business. And there, something magical happens when Moze's truck stops right in the hill, he takes a break and opens an envelope left by Addie to find her photograph on the paper moon, he realizes he's missing in the photo and she's missing him, then while he's about to make a decision, Addie, who ran out the door meets her father again and the conclusion works like the perfect punchline of a long joke: he still owed her 200$, then they drive off together for a heart-warming finale where they're finally father and daughter.The wit of the script, the clever construction of the story and Bogdanovich's meticulous direction give the film an irresistible charm, transcended by the photography that recreates the feeling of the Depression Era, and the Costume design that played quite an underrated role in the story, indirectly highlighting the character's gradual sophistication, or making Trixie so comically sexy with her jiggling breasts. The film is so well made that it's surprising it didn't garner more Oscar nominations, anyway ... if there's one department in which the movie really shines, it's undoubtedly on the acting, a 'make it or break it' parameter when it comes to comedies. Tatum delivers an extraordinary performance rightfully earning her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Her performance is great precisely because it always feel natural, the movie features so many long takes where you can see that she wasn't helped by a clever editing or something from grown-ups, she literally carried the film.",

The two O'Neals scrap constantly as they meander from town to town and misadventure to misadventure. Tatum quickly proves as adept at conning people as her dad does and they form quite a team, despite the spats.It's an enjoyable film, a comedy with slightly darker undertones. Ryan's affair with Miss Trixie Delight (Madeline Kahn) is emblematic. Ryan picks up Kahn, a cootch dancer and sometime hooker, at a carnival and she and her young, black servant join the O'Neals on their trip through Kansas. Kahn is pretty shallow, though, even compared to the two O'Neals. Ryan spends lavishly on her and presumably is comforted in return by whatever it is that she has and he wants. (This is the 1930s and \"times are hard.\") Tatum is resentful of Kahn, not only because she sees through her but because Kahn is preempting Tatum's place in the car's front seat. So Tatum becomes jealous and angry and at one point refuses to get into the car with the rest. Kahn tries to talk some sense into her and lays the whole thing out in plain language. Kahn gets something, Ryan gets something, and the two kids get something, and everything will end sooner or later with everybody a little happier. Tatum simply scowls back. \"You're going to spoil everything, aren't you?\", Kahn says, genuinely rueful.Tatum is manipulative enough to arrange for Ryan to barge into Kahn's hotel room while Kahn is picking up a few extra dollars from the hotel clerk.I guess we're supposed to be happy to see Madeline Kahn thrown out of the party, so the O'Neals can go on their happy way unencumbered. After all, Kahn is sickeningly elegant (\"I have to go winkie-tinkie again\"), while Tatum is plumb forthright (\"I have to go to the ****house\"). And Kahn sells her body, too. I must be perverse because I didn't find the outcome satisfying. Sure, Kahn is a liar and exploiter. And the O'Neals? As the Good Book says, \"Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.\" Ryan winds up getting clobbered by some crooks he stole money from (John Hillerman -- great). And the two continue their merry journey together, broke but happy.The film does its best to evoke the 1930s, for the most part successfully. A movie marquee advertises John Ford's \"Steamboat Round the Bend.\" The O'Neals call their hot dogs \"coney islands\". There always seems to be a radio playing contemporary pop songs like \"Keep Your Sunny Side Up.\" It's nicely photographed and captures the area around Hays, Kansas, pretty well, though color wouldn't have spoiled the production. The overall tone is comic and heartwarming and written and edited in a way to sound outrageous -- Tatum smokes cigarettes and knows all about sex -- though I suspect the only people who might titter at her faux sophistication would be elderly people living in towns smaller than Hays, Kansas.It's not exactly infinitely cracking, but it's so good-natured that you'll probably like it as much as I did.",

Initially using her misfortune to make some money off a third party, the two end up forging an unlikely partnership and work together to swindle some more folks.Directed by Peter Bogdanovich, Paper Moon brings its tightly-woven screenplay to life in splendid detail and is entirely devoted to its characters & their shared journey. The dialogues are sharp and accelerating the plot at all times, while the interaction between the two main characters is carried out with such precision that it's the film's highlight.The era-appropriate set pieces only add more authenticity to its timeline. Cinematography makes crisp use of greyscale photography & high contrast to give its image a sharp clarity and employs numerous long takes as well which only makes the drama more immersive. Editing keeps the flow smooth & streamlined, and unfolds the plot at a fitting pace.The most impressive thing about Paper Moon, however, are its performances. With Ryan O'Neal playing the conman & his daughter Tatum O'Neal making her screen debut in the role of the young orphan, the developing bond between the two is the soul of this picture. While Ryan chips in with a solid performance, Tatum steals the limelight with effortless ease and is the real star of this movie.On an overall scale, Paper Moon is an engrossing, entertaining & endearing delight that has all the ingredients of an instant classic and still hasn't aged a day. Filled with compelling characters, told with superb composure and further uplifted by the gripping performances of its cast, Paper Moon is one of the finest films of the 1970s and has effectively endured the test of time. In short, these aren't everyday people and this is no ordinary movie. Highly recommended.",

In fact, we talked and laughed about it all the way home. This made my mom jealous, so I got to see it again with her. Of course, she loved it, too. It's magic.

            "content": "There are some habits we just can't give up and even though we may be aware of how bad and unhealthy they are we just can't seem to see our lives without them. Same with people. Whoever goes into our lives is supposed to bring happiness, joy and a sense of belonging to it, to shine a light in the darkest of the night - but there are also those who are just paper moon in the sky, with no real value and no real light in them, just hanging there pretending to be authentic and wasting our time. But even those people bring light and, to be more precise, clearance; they teach us to see through many paper moons coming our way and notice those which are real deal.I got acquainted with Peter Bogdanovich 6 years ago when I stumbled upon one of his masterpieces, 1973's \"Paper moon\" and fell instantly in love with his directorial style and type of stories he was telling; not every one of his early movies I liked truly but I found something to think about in each one of them. In this one Peter tells a story of a con man by the name that speaks for itself - Moses, played stupendously by Ryan O'Neal, who visits his ex-lover at her funeral and finds someone there who was destined to change his life - a little girl named Addie, who bears a weird resemblance to Moses and it's no wonder - she was played by O'Neal's real-life daughter Tatum, in her debut role. This unbelievably talented little lady has even earned the movie an Oscar as the Best Supporting Actress (the only out of three nominations) for her fantastic portrayal of Addie and she remains to be the youngest to receive it to this day.Although shot in black-in-white, probably as a nod to Old Hollywood, the movie represents everything the New Hollywood stands for: more adult language spoken, wider variety of topics touched, unconventional dialogue delivery, method acting and many more; \"Paper moon\" was in the first rows of movies that brought the art of cinema to its pinnacle in early 1970s and Peter Bogdanovich was among the firsts to help shaping it the way we know it now.",

The collaborative contributions from everyone involved with Bogdanovich, from the sublime performances by Tatum O'Neal (very, very brave), Ryan O'Neal (his gift for comedy is genuine), Madeline Kahn (vulnerable and funny) and P.J. Johnson (stealing virtually every scene she's in), to the sharp cinematography by Laszlo Kovacs (everything is in deep focus), as well as Polly Platt's outstanding production design and the entertaining script by Alvin Sargent (based on Joe David Brown's novel \"Addie Pray\", unread) are a continual delight to movie lovers and film students alike. Bogdanovich brings a scholar's passion and precision to his Depression-era story about a con man who's consistently conned by his would-be eight year old (yet world-weary) daughter as they travel the Midwest and you can see the dedication in every shot, some takes of which are quite extended. The O'Neal father and daughter pairing is especially inspired: they bring out the best in each other and their hilarious, spontaneous rapport takes the film to another level; Bogdanovich uses their natural freshness as the film's centerpiece, and it's this freshness that allows him to veer off into sudden moments of seriousness that grounds the picture to the pathos of the era it portrays--it becomes real, accurate and graven even as it strives to entertain. A vital, focused masterpiece--on so many levels, it's what watching a movie is all about.",

            "review_title": "If You Believed in Me",
            "content": "This film is based upon the novel \"Addie Pray\" by Joe David Brown, but when Peter Bogdanovich adapted it for the screen he changed the title to \"Paper Moon\". He took his title from a popular song which contains the lyrics \"It is only a paper moon/ Hanging over a cardboard sea/ But it wouldn't be make believe/ If you believe in me\". Bogdanovich used this as the movie's theme tune, but it also has a relevance to the story, which is all about a man who earns his living by persuading people to believe in him.The action takes place during the 1930s. The film is shot in black-and-white, an unusual move for the seventies, but as with his earlier film \"The Last Picture Show\", set in the fifties, Bogdanovich wanted to capture the look of films from the period. The main characters are Moses Pray, an itinerant con-man, and Addie Loggins, a nine-year-old girl who may, or may not, be his daughter. Moses was certainly a lover of Addie's mother, but so were several other men, and Addie's paternity is never definitely established.The film follows the adventures of Moses and Addie as they drive through Kansas and Missouri in search of victims for their con tricks. Moses' favourite scam is to pose as a Bible salesman and to persuade grieving widows that, shortly before they died, their husbands had ordered a de-luxe edition Bible inscribed with their wife's name. (He has already ascertained these details by reading the obituary columns in newspapers). Along the way Moses becomes entangled with an \"exotic dancer\" named Trixie Delight and gets into trouble with a corrupt sheriff when he attempts to double-cross a bootlegger who just happens to be the sheriff's brother. (The story is set in the late thirties, after the ending of national Prohibition, but at a time when some states, including Kansas, still imposed prohibition at a local level).Moses and Addie are played by Ryan and Tatum O'Neal, who are of course father and daughter in real life. Tatum won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, setting a record which still stands as the youngest ever winner of a competitive Oscar. And it is easy to see why. Addie is not a conventionally pretty child, but is nevertheless absolutely irresistible. When we first see her it is a quiet, solemn little waif at her mother's funeral, but she soon reveals herself as worldly-wise beyond her years, quite able to hold her own with Moses and an accomplished confidence trickster in her own right. She is able to get far more for the Bibles than he can, although she is quite capable of giving them away for free if the bereaved family are poor and deserving. Ryan's own performance is a good one, but even he is outclassed by his daughter.\"Paper Moon\" is one of two great American comedies from 1973 with a thirties setting, the other being \"The Sting\". In terms of visual style, the two are very different, the bright colours of \"The Sting\" making it look very different from anything ever made in the thirties. The two films do, however, have certain things in common. Both make much use of the popular music of the early 20th century, in the case of \"The Sting\" the piano rages of Scott Joplin and in \"Paper Moon\", apart from the title song, several other hits from the thirties.More importantly, the central figures of both films may be con artists who make their living in ways which put them outside the law, yet in both cases those figures are presented as heroes, the ones whom the audience will be rooting for, not as villains. It is significant that the films are both set during the Great Depression, a time when economic hardship had, for many Americans, greatly reduced the possibility of earning a living honestly. The characters played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford in \"The Sting\" are minor-league criminals trying to outwit a major-league one in revenge for the death of a friend. Here Moses is also the underdog in his dealings with the bootlegger and the sheriff, and even though his Bible scheme may be dishonest, it does not really hurt anyone. In the hands of their new owners, those Bibles will become dearly loved mementoes of their departed husbands. And who could help rooting for the adorable Addie and her guardian, even if he is something of a reluctant guardian?I think that Bogdanovich's decision to film in black-and-white paid off; as in \"The Last Picture Show\" (set in Texas) he brings a certain monumental grandeur to the flat, featureless American prairies. \"The Last Picture Show\" is certainly a fine film, but I would rate \"Paper Moon\" even higher- the narrative, for example, is better handled and the story is easier to follow. It is at the same time an engaging comedy and part of the great American tradition of road movies which tell you something about the country and its people. One of the great American films of the seventies. 9/10",

Shot in Black & White with a nostalgic sheen, the story sets in the depression era, Moses Pray (Ryan O'Neal) is a small-time crook, attends one of his lover's funeral and ends up bringing her 9-year-old daughter Addie (Tatum O'Neal) on the road, it is another odd-pair road trip and Addie strongly believes Moses is her biological father because they have the same chin. Initially reluctantly taking her with him for fear of hindering his con-artist exploits, Moses surprisingly finds out Addie is a great helper in the game, she is a precocious and cunning doll, with acute perception of the folks and surroundings, moreover, she can meticulously scheme a plot to get what she wants, she would become a much competent con artist than her father figure. Growing up in the absence of a father figure, Addie is well versed with the savvy of the adult world, her adept cigarette-smoking is dreadful to watch at first glance, but Tatum O'Neal is impeccably phenomenal to nail the scene, ever since the moment when she ingeniously blackmails Moses into taking her with him with the indelible line-delivery \"You owe me $200!\", until the very end, her last line \"You still owe me $200!\", she has accomplished a remarkable feat as one of the best children performance ever, she is compellingly projecting a wild spectrum of sympathetic qualities resided in a child, our empathy for her is overpowering, much more than for Moses, although Ryan O'Neal is riveting too as a man wandering along with disarming charisma but can never find his roots. This real-life father-daughter pair constitutes a sheer transfixing rapport, particularly whenever Addie surprises him (and viewers too) with her sophisticated volition, she is his guardian angel on certain level, that's why the coda is so emotive and delightful at the same time, in the film's own plaintive core, they find each other to stick together on the road. If there is any justice in the world, Tatum should have nabbed a BEST LEADING ACTRESS trophy instead Oscar's BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS, which she won, and leaves that to Ms. Kahn. the bone-structure referring, brassy artiste Trixie Delight, a sultry interloper into the pair's life, against her comical default, Madeline's telling monologue reveals much deeper into her character's personality, she is laughable, but also piteous, yet she and Addie cannot co-exist with Moses, so she will be written off in the most farcical manner at the expense of Addie's carefully plotted trickery and the aid of Trixie's black teenage assistant Imogene (Johnson). PAPER MOON doesn't fall into the victim of time as most oldies pictures, apart from the prominent cast, its top-notch script from Alvin Sargent, based on Joe David Brown's novel \"ADDIE PRAY\", neatly sidesteps from awkward self-pity (especially when dealing with orphans), emotional over-charge (the father-and-daughter affinity) and lame caricature (when Trixie is the easy target to aim). Peter Bogdanovich's consistent emphasis on the interaction between the odd pair and its eye-pleasing monochromatic cinematography from L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, dotted with a retro soundtrack instead of an obtrusive score, this is THE (almost) perfect film!",

Seeing the poster, I had an impression that it was another one of those father-daughter kidflick movie, the type that's often broadcast on TV during the holidays.But, I was in for quite a surprise. What I ended up seeing was a dark comedic gen that tells the story of two grifters: a father (Moze) and his 9-year old daughter (Addie), who meet for the first time at Addie's mother's funeral. Moze plans to leave Addie at an Aunt's in Missouri. However, Addie is not one to give up easily and she demands that Moze pay her back her $200 (which he spent). After several refusals, Addie threatens to go to the police which finally gets Moze to give in. Now all he has to do is get hold of $200, which he does by conning widows. He's soon to find out that Addie has a flair for deception too AND she's cleverer than him. But this is just the beginning of an adventure that a father and his daughter will embark on.Peter Bogdanovich's uses of black and white instead of colour is very effective. While the movie is set in the 30s, it reminds the viewer of what's called the 'golden age of Hollywood cinema'. At the same time the performances are subtle and nuanced. Tatum O'Neal truly does deliver one of the best performances by a child that I have ever seen. Ryan O'Neal too is terrific and so is the excellent supporting cast that includes Madeleine Kahn, P.J. Johnson and John Hillerman.Bogdanovich has given a lot of attention to detail as it shows in Lazlo Kovacs outstanding cinematography. The locations, sets and costumes look authentic. The director tells the story in a way that the viewer can easily relate to. The story could have easily risked being highly melodramatic and sentimental and Bogdanovich knew how to avoid that. Pretty much every single character in 'Paper Moon' is human, not a villain or a hero.'Paper Moon' is one of the finest movies that depicts, in an unusual but relatable way, the relationship between a father and daughter. Detailed, funny, disturbing, subtle and poignant with great visuals, acting, music, cinematography and a beautiful story, 'Paper Moon' is a whole package of a grand classic in the form of a little gem.",

The story keeps the relationship intentionally ambiguous and leaves it to the viewer's imagination, but if you're like me, you probably wind up rooting for it to be true. Addie (Tatum O'Neal) turns out to be a consummate hustler who one-ups 'Moze' more than once, from her off the cuff Bible pricing to breaking up his road romance with Miss Trixie Delight (Madeline Kahn). But the elder O'Neal is no slouch in the con game himself, as his whiskey scam and wrasslin' match maneuver clearly show. This is another of those Seventies flicks that I saw when it first came out, and not again until some forty plus years later, and it still holds up well as an entertaining picture. In my case, it helps that it was done in glorious black and white, just like director Peter Bogdanovich's masterpiece (in my opinion), \"The Last Picture Show\". If you consider the story in it's entirety, it's a nicely developed caper and heist movie which compares favorably with another 1973 film, \"The Sting\". Picture if you will Redford and Newman in a double team up with the two O'Neals and you've got the makings for a con with a sure fire blow-off. I'd even pay double to see that one.",

Basically, set in Great Depression era in Missouri and Kansas, the story follows con man Moses Pray (Golden Globe nominated Ryan O'Neal) who travels around with ten year old Addie Loggins (Oscar and Golden Globe (nominated and) winning Tatum O'Neal) to take her back to her Aunt in St. Joseph, Missouri, but she finds out he took $200 to take her, and she wants him to give it back to her. Addie is the orphaned daughter of a prostitute, and Moses had an affair with her mother, but he denies he is her father, besides bearing some resemblance, including having a similar jaw. Along the way she finds out how he earns his money, he finds the names and address in newspaper obituaries of women who has recently been widowed, and goes to visit them as a worker of the \"Kansas Bible Company\", \"spreading the Lord's gospel\", and claiming their dead husband ordered a bible but didn't pay, and they fall for it. With this knowledge in mind Addie decides to get her owed money to help Moses in any way she can, whether it is looking cute to get more money, or helping him get out of a bad situation, and they seem to make a good team, even while bickering. Along the way they pick up stripper who calls herself Trixie Delight (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Madeline Kahn), as well as her trampled upon African-American maid Imogene (P.J. Johnson), Addie becomes friends with the maid but jealous of his father's female friend gaining the attention. She finds out that Moses spent all the money they earned on a new car to impress Trixie, so she decides to get rid of her, with Imogene's help they manage to steal some money to allow the maid to get away, and Trixie is made to look guilty of an affair with another man. After ditching Trixie, Moses and Addie continue travelling, and they stop at a bootleggers on the way, stealing some bottles of whiskey, and selling it back to the same bootlegger, and after they find out his brother is the police sheriff. After being arrested Moses and Addie, she has hidden their money, and they manage to steal their car back and escape to trade their vehicle for another, and they make it across the border where the law can't follow. The sheriff finds them in Missouri and he beats Moses very severely, but he is alright and he drops Addie off to her aunt's house, and driving away a little bit he stops to look at a photo of her in a paper moon, and the little girl catches up running to him, and reminding him of the money he owes her they drive away together. Also starring John Hillerman as Deputy Hardin / Jess Hardin and Randy Quaid as Leroy. Ryal O'Neal is fantastic as the often antagonistic and manipulative fake salesman and possible father, but his real life daughter Tatum does almost steal the show as his bratty and clever beyond her age girl who joins him (she beat Linda Blair in The Exorcist, but she did deserve it), and Kahn gets her time on screen as well as the bitchy showgirl who seems to only care about herself. The pairing of the real life father and daughter makes fantastic scenes with great scripting and dialogue, it is frequently funny, at moments thrilling, and heart warming in certain scenes as well, overall it is a wonderfully brilliant period comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy.

            "content": "In the early seventies director Peter Bogdanovich looked like he would be part of the talented roster of new Hollywood film makers (Spielberg, Coppola, Lucas) that had suddenly burst onto the scene. Bogdanovich a film critic and confidante of the likes of Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock had like the others learned his chops through the Roger Corman horror school with an impressive debut horror cheapie featuring Boris Karloff called Targets. He then followed up with three straight box office and critical hits, The Last Picture Show, What's Up Doc? and arguably his best, Paper Moon. Moon traverses the same dusty roads of the depression era that the earlier Bonnie and Clyde does and while there's a lot less gun play it's very much the same rollicking bumpy ride.Moses Pray hustles bibles on unsuspecting widows to make a living when he reluctantly agrees to take recently orphaned Addie Loggins to her aunt in Missouri. Addie suspects that Moses could be her father, something he wants no part of. Addie it turns out is every bit as streetwise as Pray and the two form an uneasy alliance and con their way across the countryside. For part of the trip Trixie Delight a woman of dubious character and her much put upon maid join them but Addie soon puts a stop to that by devising a clever set-up. The two are soon back on the road alone where things get uglier but not enough to destroy this delightful pictures sunny disposition.As he did in Last Picture Show Bogdanovich again displays a deft touch for black and white film composition. Of course it helps to have master cinematographers like Robert Surtees (Show) and Laszlo Kovacs lensing the work but it is Bogdanovich who manages to convey the very different feel of both films through his actors and the mood he establishes (nostalgia without crushing sentimentality) that fits so well with the somber monochromatic imagery.The usually dull Ryan O'Neil gives a commendable performance as the flustered con-artist Moses. Playing mostly straight man to Addie he is always a step behind her as she indirectly takes charge on more than one occasion to save the day. Argumentative and abrasive as their screen characters are with each other, father daughter chemistry has never transferred to screen so well. Tatum O'Neil's Addie can't help but walk away with the show as the orphaned waif priming herself for a life of hard knocks. She's no Shirley Temple or for that matter Little Miss Sunshine. She's observant, knows how to play the game and easily outwits most adults she matches wits with. Her tough exterior belies the helpless little girl stereotype making her vulnerable moments all the more powerful. The film ultimately belongs to her character but you never know it when Madeline Khan's Trixie Delight shows up. This terrific supporting actress from the seventies gave any film she appeared in back then a boost and she does here as the brassy, mean spirited threat to Addie.Bogdonovich's talent deserted him shortly after this with terrible comedies (Nickelodeon, They All Laughed), dull dramas (Daisy Miller, St. Jack) and an horrendous musical (At Long Last Love) but if anyone is in search of some of the best B&W films of the past 40 years they could start with Picture Show and this little gem.",

            "content": "Take old fashioned, Black & White film. It's not as expensive to develop. Bring Camera Crews out into small, old towns in the Midwest; where one can take interesting shots of the existing infrastructure, the old filling stations, drive in restaurants and old downtown districts. This is not at all as costly as building sets and renting studio spaces.Now, let's see, how about instead of an original score, or even purchasing stock background music, we'll take old 78 RPM records and incorporate their vocals and instrumentals into the films soundtrack. We would, of course, choose recordings that were made around 1936, the height of the Great Depression and, incidentally, the year of occurrence of the story! Put these elements all together and what have we got? A little cheapie picture that would be good for showings at Drive-Ins and for double features, right? Hell no! The Film Maker,Director, Mr. Peter Bogdanovich took this occasion to put together a work of true beauty. It is a most memorable picture and will surely be revered in the future as among the best films of the 1970's.The story involves a grifter, Moses Pray by name (Ryan O'Neal), who makes his living by traveling the country and selling Bibles to the next of kin of the recently deceased.(That's all we'll say about that. See the film!)When he stops to pay last respects to a deceased lady, who he had known well (in the Biblical sense), he accepts the job of driving the now orphaned 11 year old girl to a relative's house in Missouri. One Lady at the Funeral Service remarks that the child, Addie Loggins(Tatum O'Neal), had the \"same jaw\" as Mose, asking him if he was the daddy. Mose of denies it, but we in the audience knew better.From the location in Kansas, the pair sets off for Missouri, and have one misadventure after another. Between the Bible \"selling\" and the interaction with locals, the story moves at a quick, though not hurried, pace.(At film's end, it is difficult to believe that 102 minutes have passed.)Mr. Bogdanovich had a great group of colorful characters to work with and did a superb job in casting the right actors to fill the roles and bring them to life. Madeline Kahn as Miss Trixie Delight, \"Exotic\" Dancer and real \"Pro\" steals much of the show with a flamboyant, over the top characterization. John Hillerman in his pre-MAGNUM P.I. days, does well in a duel role as Bootlegger and his Crooked Cop brother.The rest of the cast is populated with very talented supporting people, who did a commendable job in rounding out the troupe.Peter Bogdanovich took this largely \"unknown\" cast, with this B & W cheapie film, in these small, out of the way hamlets and made a very compelling comedy-drama.Oh and what about those \"old records\" used for the music? Well all Peter B. did with those was to add them to some genuine clips from \"Old Time Radio\" to create a true sensation and about as realistic a slice of the Depression Era Americna as we could ever hope for.*NOTE: * We don't mean to assert that Mr. Bogdanovich actually just took the score for the soundtrack's opening theme and other songs in the incidental music from Granny's old 78 RPM Albums up in the attic. All recordings and artists are clearly identified in the credits; so we know that the Director handed out some $teep Royaltie$ to the various Record Companies involved. Whatever it was, Pete, it was sure worth it!",

            "content": "Peter Bogdanovich's 'Paper Moon' is everything a road movie is supposed to be - a life-changing personal journey, a quest, a bit old-fashioned and above all, a hoot. The story is simple. Young Addie (Tatum O'Neal) finds herself orphaned with the death of her single - and apparently rather free-spirited - mother. The arrival of a man named Moze (her real-life father, Ryan O'Neal) at the funeral, provides the other mourners a chance to pack Addie off to her aunt in Missouri. Moze is reluctant to take her along, but sees a chance to blackmail some money out of the whole situation. However, his dreams of pocketing a windfall of $200 and sending Addie off on a train come to nothing - the wily young girl demands the greatly diminished sum that was meant for her care. As a result, he finds himself saddled with this grimly adult child (who is fairly certain that Moze is her father) as his assistant in a crime spree through the Midwest \u2013 a scam involving sale of overpriced Bibles to recent widows. In essence, Moze scans obituaries for gullible widows he can convince to pay the balance on Bibles their husbands \"ordered\" for them - deluxe editions with the names embossed in gold - before \"passing on\". Unsurprisingly, Addie is an adroit, if unruly, student, who upstages both his skill and daring.Yes, 'Paper Moon' is about two con artists, but not really about their con, and that's a relief. The scam is only part of the story, which takes a number of turns before reaching its end - including Moze picking up a tart from a sideshow - a carnival dancer named Trixie Delight (a cheerfully trampy Madeline Kahn), who is accompanied by a long suffering black maid, Imogene (wonderfully played by P. J. Johnson) who later turns out to be Addie's partner-in-crime. Bogdanovich takes the con games only as the experience which his two lead characters share and which draws them together in a way that's funny sometimes, but also very poignant and finally deeply touching.The film is shot in gorgeous black-and-white, giving it a documentary feel that meshes perfectly with the sweet cynicism of the characters. But what really underscores the film is amazing chemistry between the O'Neals. The fact they are father and daughter in real life helps flavor their working dynamic in an intriguing way. Tatum O'Neal is an absolute revelation - she spends much of the film with a sourpuss expression pasted to her adorable little pixie face, but breezes through the film with astonishing confidence. Ryan O'Neal's roguish charm is perfect for the character and the result, paired with his daughter, is a strong co-lead dynamic, in a tale about their delicate relationship that teeters on father-and-daughter quality without adopting the name.A true treasure, Peter Bogdanovich's Paper Moon belongs to a magical world that has elements of whimsy and noir!",

Most of all!! Isn't \"Paper Moon\" a film which initiates a compendium of some of the most creative types of humor you have ever seen in virtually any movie made whatsoever!!! To quote another movie (\"A Funny Thing Happened To Me On The Way To The Forum\") \"Nothing with kings, nothing with crowns, bring on the LOVERS!! liars and clowns\"...\"Old situations, new complications, something for everyone it's Comedy\" (Ryan O'Neal) \"Comedy\" (Tatum O'Neal) \"Comedy\" (Madeline Kahn) \"Comedy\" (John Hilerman) \"Comedy\" (Randy Quaid) TONIGHT!!!\".. How devoutly we the movie audience will root for the underdog...Fathers and daughters are suppose to go to chocolate cake socials in the public school gymnasium together, they are not suppose to be swindling bootleggers, merchants, and well to do widows!!!!! ..The precarious camaraderie between Ryan and Tatum O'Neal resonates itself to whereby con games are a dangerous form of nefarious fun!! Their overall philosophy being: \"Please understand that we are only human!\" \"Let us hasten to add\" \"Please understand that we are only human, and the country is in the middle of the Depression!!!\" This movie is hilarious! If you are not laughing outwardly throughout the entire film, your eyes are smiling every minute of this incredibly funny film.. guaranteed!! The plot is very well developed in this movie, and, the acting, cinematography, and director, are all first rate with this comedy classic!! In my opinion, Ryan O'Neal has never been better, of course, I'm not a woman!! The role of the charming finagler by default, suits Ryan O'Neal perfectly!!! Tatum O'Neal has never been better!! Her role is such that even as young as Adie is, she realizes that situational survival necessitates pecuniary chicanery!!! The whole thirties genre with this movie is sensational!! \"Paper Moon\" is one of my favorite movies of all time, I even love the song!!...The title was conjured up as a result of Tatum giving Ryan a picture of herself sitting on a paper moon at a carnival...It is sort of a love by way of a kindred spirit..There is love through marriage! There is love through family and friendship bonds!! There is love through sexual encounters! This love, however, is predicated on the parlayed premise of \"Hey! Don't we make a great team of cons, no one swindles people with more finesse than the two of us...Don't you think?\".. In 1973, when this movie was released, it manufactured a tailor made invitation for the moviegoer to be empathetic with the thought patterns of a con man!! \"Sting\" came out that year too, and \"Sting\" won for best picture in 1973. The mercurial charm of a swindler, and, his wickedly clever wiles of debauchery, became a train of thought which garnered a fascinating charisma with the movie audience that year!! The director of the film, \"Paper Moon\" Peter Bogdanovich, sets his own standards for the definition of a great movie...He articulates an aspect of human nature whereby the characters in the movie are innately aware of their seedier side!!! They are cajoled by lucrative adversity, and thus, very susceptible to the yearnings of the proverbial larceny in the soul!! Bogdanovich evokes a bittersweet empathy for the performing actors in his movie, as well as the emotions of people in general, this is what makes him an excellent director!! \"Paper Moon\" is Bogdanovich's prize movie, mostly on account of it's artistic gratification!!!

Look, the US was coming out of the revolutionary Sixties - romanticism was in order.I saw this film again recently on DVD. It's a gem. Taken from its 1970s context, it's obvious that Bogdanovich had talent like Polanski. There are so many scenes in the film that work because Bogdanovich made them work. This film suggests simple humanity. What went wrong for Bogdanovich? Why didn't this guy get the chance to settle down and do more? Kubrick got the chance - and then produced machinistic, technical schlock. 'Paper Moon' has more warmth -despite its austerity- than all of Kubrick's films combined.Last points? Gotta daughter? Watch it with her. I predict that in 2123, people will watch this film, laugh, and simply believe that it comes from a previous century - as we today confuse the novels of Emile Zola and Victor Hugo.",

            "content": "\"Paper Moon\" is a cute, watchable movie with a very dangerous message, that a child may be better off leading a criminal life than staying with boring relatives. Bogdanovich shot it in black and white to better reflect its setting, 1935 Kansas during the depression. The title comes from one scene where Addie has her photo made at a carnival, sitting on a \"paper\" (cardboard) moon. Metaphorically it represents the falsehood of the grifting life she and Mose have come to lead. Some SPOILERS follow, read further at your own risk. Recently orphaned Addie, her mother was into prostitution, didn't know who her dad was, Mose (Ryan Oneal) at the funeral to pay respects, Addie suspects he is her dad, but throughout the movie he never admits to it. He is headed towards St Louis and she needs to get to her aunt in St Joseph, so he is talked into giving her a ride. He makes his living as a grifter, reading obit columns, embossing the widow's name on a fancy bible, then showing up a week or two later and telling the widow her dead husband had ordered it for her, he then collects a healthy profit. Mose isn't very smart, soon Addie is sizing up the widows, and to one with several small children says \"This one is already paid for\", and to another, wealthy one, \"This version costs $25\", instead of the usual $8. In the end, Mose is undone by a bootlegger who also happens to be the sherrif's brother. He sells the bootlegger his own stolen whiskey.  They escape to Missouri temporarily but are caught by the men, beaten, and robbed. In the end we see Addie at her aunt's, bored by the prospective safe life there, runs and catches up with Mose and they disappear down the road together.\nNot a very good message!! But a landmark film only because Tatum Oneal won an Oscar for best supporting actor, at least at that time the youngest ever. Maybe still, I don't know.",

            "content": "It's difficult to watch this film with any impartiality, as it was one of the formative films of my childhood years. Seeing it now, over 40 years after it came out, I'm convinced it's one of the finest American films ever made. Many other viewers here have pointed out the main reasons for its greatness--so I'd like to shine a light on, perhaps, some of the less-credited components of the film's success. I'm calling them \"Paper Moon's Unsung Heroes\":Unsung hero #1: There's been little mention here of the actor who truly anchors this film--and gives the finest performance of his career-- Ryan O'Neal. He delivers a fully-realized, multi-faceted performance, more than worthy of an Oscar nomination (if not a \"win\"), in my opinion-- and he received neither. Try watching Paper Moon with your eye on O'Neal pere, rather than his adorable, scene- stealing daughter. Firstly, of course, he was one of the handsomest actors of his era, which makes such an undertaking a painless effort. But watch the subtlety of his expressions, and his nuanced comic turns. For example, in the hotel scene, where he's having his breakfast, when Imogene comes down to tell him that 'Miss Trixie' is having her \"ladies' time,\" his reaction, turning from concerned to mortified, as he rapidly sits back down, while dropping his voice by an octave...now THAT'S comedy! His comic delivery in his first big scene with Addie (the \"diner scene\") is also brilliant. In fact, I can't think of a single scene where he is not completely \"true-to- character\". In the hands of another actor, this deceptively difficult role could have been played as 'malevolent'. O'Neal's performance shows 'Moze' to be a lovable rascal who does what he has to do in order to survive during the Great Depression. Imagine, say, Jack Nicholson in the role...It would certainly have been a different film altogether. (Sidebar comment: I realize one shouldn't judge a film actor's performance with how they are 'off-screen'--but if what Tatum says about him in her books and interviews is true, O'Neal is not quite-as-lovable a rogue, off-screen. She claims that when the Oscar nominations were announced, she did sort of a \"Nahh- nah-nah-nah-nahh,\" to him, as bratty 10-year-olds are known to do-- and he fully punched her in the face! Gulp. All four of his children are either addicts, alcoholics or in major therapy. But I digress). The #2 \"unsung hero(-ine) of this movie is the late, brilliant Polly Platt, Peter Bogdanovich's first wife (and soon-to-be-ex-wife, as he had already taken up with Cybill Shepard when this film was made). Ms. Platt designed the costumes and realized the whole \"look\" of the film, which Bogdanovich fully-credits her for. I can't think of any other American film of the last 50 years that so completely captures the 1930's in such a flawlessly realistic way. The attention to detail is staggering--look at any single \"extra\" in this film, and they are all absolutely spot-on correct to the look of that era (the hotel clerk in the 'bootlegger hotel,' with her perfect '30s \"Marcelle wave\" comes to mind. Unsung hero #3: Gary Chason, who PERFECTLY cast this film, including several first-time actors (Tatum O'Neal, of course...as well as Burton Gilliam, (\"Floyd the Hotel Clerk\"), P.J. Johnson (Imogene), among many others). I'm hard-pressed to think of another film--ever- -in which every single role is so perfectly-filled...and often by first-time actors! Unsung hero #4: L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kov\u00e1cs, the brilliant cinematographer. Every single shot is so perfectly thought-out and realized. In the hands of a lesser-visionary, \"Paper Moon\" would certainly have been a lesser film than it is (and imagine if it had been shot in COLOR!). FINALLY--he's certainly not \"unsung\"--but clearly, he's \"under- sung\": PETER BOGDANOVICH! This film is a work of sheer genius, and all roads lead back to him. I consider Paper Moon the crowning achievement of his career (with apologies to \"Last Picture Show\"). It's almost as if his career has followed the same \"arc\" as that of his great hero, mentor and friend, Orson Welles. Both of them had their greatest successes, straight out of the gate...and then were rather hung-out-to-dry by Hollywood, as if considered \"pass\u00e9\". I keep waiting for the world to WAKE UP and realize Paper Moon is one of the absolute FINEST films in history--and should be lauded accordingly! Why is Peter Bogdanovich NOT still being given the opportunity to direct major Hollywood studio films?? The man is one of the true cinematic geniuses of our era. And yes, he is certainly a 'peer' of his hero, Mr. Welles. Could we please give him the reverence he deserves? (\"Special Mention\" to Tatum O'Neal, too! It seems to be \"common wisdom\" today, that she was simply some kind of \"human puppet\" for Bogdanovich to manipulate every word and movement of. I beg to differ, strongly. Some of her expressions and line deliveries are so singularly charming and individualistic--proving that she is clearly an innately-skilled and intuitive actress. This performance was no fluke. This girl/lady deserves more credit than she's given, and I say she absolutely deserved that Oscar...though it should have been for \"Best Actress,\"--with, of course, Madeline Kahn as \"Best Supporting Actress\"!).",

The O'Neals drive around Depression-era Kansas doing \"a little widow business\" so that he can re-pay her the $200 he bilked in her name. Miss Delight is along for the ride. What really happens is that the two loners bond despite everything. Is he really her father? We never find out.Also good in this great film are John Hillerman in two roles, Burton Gilliam as the smarmy hotel desk clerk, Randy Quaid as the yokel, and Dorothy Forster as the Widow Huff.As in Bogdanovich's The Last Picture Show, the countryside takes on a persona. The very flatness and desolation of these dust bowl towns serve as a metaphor for the empty lives of the wandering characters. Bogdanovich also shows an exceptional eye for 1930s detail in clothing, music, and in the snippets of radio shows we hear, including Jack Benny and Fibber McGee and Molly. Although I knew most of the songs, the only singing voice I recognized was that of Dick Powell.The entire cast of extras and bit players is perfect as well. Just a wonderful film all around. It's a pity Kahn had to compete against O'Neal in the supporting actress category; Ryan O'Neal didn't even get a nomination and he is superb!",

Yet, being a road picture, many interesting and touching moments occur along the way, as well as a very poignant and nostalgic look-back to America in the 1930s.Director Peter Bogdanovich, a pupil of the great Orson Welles and rising filmmaker at the time, took many chances in getting this film made; shooting it in black and white, casting an unknown little girl with a bad haircut as the main character and using numerous old-school techniques are just a few. Yet, it is obvious that because of a very humorous and entertaining script, Bogdanovich had a solid foundation with which to work with. Perhaps these veteran styles work because we care so much about these characters or even because Bogdanovich handles them so well.What cannot be denied is the remarkable chemistry between the two O'Neals, a fine sight to see given all the tumultuous trouble they have had over the years. This film is a clear reminder of better-remembered days in Hollywood; when actors worked for good scripts rather than money, black and white photography was not a turn-off and children were written as smart as the adults but in a more tender and innocent way. Bogdanovich certainly dreamed of those days when making this and perhaps the greatest success of this film is that he created a story that now fits that exact billing.",

            "content": "Paper Moon is set in during The Great Depression, but Peter Bogdanovich does not mean for it to be a hard- hitting, no-holds-barred examination of those times and its people. The focus is on a man and his apparent daughter, who never seem to run out of money and have an abundance of time and energy to pursue their greater desires. To be fair, Bogdanovich has etched some of the background characters as figures to be sympathetic of; the black girl Imogene who was promised a hefty four dollars a week to tag along and be the personal assistant (slave) of the showgirl/part time prostitute Trixie Delight, for example. She muses she has not seen a cent of this money, but figures that driving around the countryside in a brand new luxury car and having a full belly most of the time is not such a bad time compared to her family's situation back home. This is about as deep as the hardships go; the film's presentations of the \"hard times\" are mostly in air quotes. It has a pretty, closed- off view of The Great Depression, a little caricature with more laughs and giggles than real insight. The main pair run a clever scam involving expensive, personalised bibles that specifically targets those already in emotional turmoil - but we are meant to brush past this fact. Bogdanovich instead goes for the simple moral lessons, from the perspective of little Addie Loggins. She sees a horde of starving, haggard children her age, and shouts out that the bible has already been paid for. She (and we) see the closeups of a wealthy women's jewellery and she hurriedly ups the price. Later we are meant to grin along with her in the car because of the tenacity of this little game - the intent is to be comedic and heartwarming. We're also supposed to laugh along as the Trixie's faux-elegance (\"I have to go winkie tinkie!\") is exposed and kicked out from their lives But it doesn't quite stick because the only moral difference that exists here is that they are the main protagonists and she is not. Bogdanovich only offers simply, clean-cut moral cop-outs to make us root for Addie and her mischief - which is why their scams and antics ultimately don't affect anyone in any drastic, depraved way (a well- off shop and a wealth bootlegger, in reality the cops, are two targets). Tatum O'Neal is the real star. Her character is written as endearingly feisty, but ends up a little annoying by the end. Her portrayal even nails this quality; the way she nags and nags until she gets what she wants, and the small grins afterwards. Addie's best moment is not in her brazen dialogue at all, but in her actions and how they reveal just how tender aged and sweet she is. Sneaking out in the middle of the night to peer at the one last remaining photo of her mother, and silently posing in her manner.",

            "content": "Director Peter Bogdanovich helped start the nostalgia craze of the 1970's with his masterpiece \"The Last Picture Show,\" which evoked memories of coming of age in small-town Texas in the 1950's. \"Paper Moon\" continued in the same vein this time conjuring up visions of American in the 1930's during the worst depression in history. In both films authentic tell-tale songs from the eras intensified the time travel. Hollywood and independent producers aping Bogdnovich began turning out nostalgia fodder at an alarming rate. Most were mere imitations but there were a few that took Bogdanovich's ideas and technique and presented them in creative amalgams, I.E. \"Summer of '42,\" \"Animal House,\" and one of the best of them all \"American Graffiti.\" \"Paper Moon\" stands on its own merits not only because of the brilliant direction and cinematography (filmed on location around Hays, Kansas, and St. Joseph, Missouri) and the well-chosen musical selections of the period, but also because of a well-written script based on a novel by Joe David Brown with a wonderful cast which virtually introduced one of my favorite contemporary actors who has not yet received his due Randy Quaid. Quaid's only screen exposure before this film was an uncredited bit part in the highly underrated Bogdovich film \"Targets,\" featuring Boris Karloff in his final major performance which remains one of his best. Peter Bogdanovich did well by changing the title from the book \"Addie Pray\" to the more meaningful metaphorical \"Paper Moon,\" based on the popular tune (also used in the film) of the period.The casting of father daughter team Ryan and Tatum O'Neal was inspired. The rest of the cast would be difficult to fault. Standing tall as always is the comic genius of the late Madeline Kahn. How can a viewer keep from laughing at her antics and lines? And why has P.J. Johnson only made two movies? She was off to a good start playing Imogene.The story appears to be a simple one. A scam artist posing as a Bible salesman to fleece recent widows out of a few bucks picks up a nine year old orphan while attending the funeral of the girl's mother to deliver to her aunt in St. Joseph, Missouri. The confidence man Moses Pray may or may not be the little girl's daddy. On the road the two bond with each other without wanting to admit it. The movie is basically an odyssey across mid-America filled with unsuspected leaps and bounds.In some ways the tale is patterned after Mark Twain's novels of Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. The little girl Addie Loggins is somewhat of a female counterpart to Huck and Tom updated to the 20th century. There may not be as much satire as in Twain's works but there is some. For example the lawmen depicted in the film are just as crooked and double dealing as Moses. Yet they hide behind a badge and respectability whereas Moses and Addie know exactly what they are. Moses tells Addie, \"I got scruples too, you know. You know what that is? Scruples? Addie replies emphatically, \"No, I don't know what it is, but if you got 'em, it's a sure bet they belong to somebody else!",

The film ultimately proves less than satisfying because of a weak, episodic script that is a bit too contrived and tends to wander somewhat aimlessly.

Honestly, I couldn't help thinking about Charlie Chaplin and Jack Coogan from The Kid!The ending is a tad bit predictable, though. Nevertheless, the execution is pretty exquisite that kept me from being very sure about how the movie will end. Also, the ending is as heartwarming and sweet as the whole movie. So, it's not really a big problem.What amazed me is how smartly scripted this movie is. The way the problems are solved in the plot is genius. The main characters keep get in troubles a lot through their journey, and they get out of them in a convincing and intelligent way. But it's also silly and ridiculous at the same time to match the nostalgic approach that Peter Bogdanovich took from the get-go. That's really a lesson that many directors and screenwriters should learn nowadays; which is that when they decide to capture the essence of a bygone cinematic era, they have to make their film relevant to a modern audience by making it seem smarter and more sensible, hence more convincing.Every sub-plot is consistent, amusing, and really adds to the characters and the main storyline. The sub-plot of Trixie also has no shortage of brilliance and fun, but I think it didn't need to be that long. It felt like that it was a pitfall that the screenwriter fell into, but didn't want to get out of it in an unconvincing and flimsy way so he had to take his time planning a reasonable and plausible way. That said, I enjoyed every second of this very sub-plot as much as the entire movie.Paper Moon is simply a thoroughly engaging, very moving and touching, quite charming, surprisingly clever and sincere ode to Depression-era road movies.(9/10)",

            "content": "The severe worldwide economic decline of the 30s, most popularly known as \"The Great Depression\", resulted in thousands of individuals bargaining and bribing their way to earning a living. Money was a rarity. Businesses collapsed. Streets were deserted. For sophisticated con man Moses Pray, whom ironically preyed on vulnerable widows into purchasing a personalised bible, lack of funds was the least of his newfound problems. When visiting a funeral procession to pay his respects to nine-year-old Addie's mother, whom is now suspected as her father based on facial similarities (although persistently denies that supposed fantasy), he agrees to deliver the orphan to her aunt's house cross state in Missouri. The foreboding road trip ahead however, would challenge both individuals in monetary mentality and superfluous guardianship.Bogdanovich's adaptation of Brown's character-titled 'Addie Pray', may not illicit a multitude of profound themes, but confidently illustrates the camaraderie between juxtaposing generations through engaging humour. First and foremost, it's a comedic road-trip feature. Bogdanovich rarely veers from the intended destination. Addie, with her astonishingly mature sensibilities, consistently gaining the upper hand in her \"business relationship\" with Moses, by initially demanding two-hundred dollars and possessing improved sleight-of-hand trickery to capitalise on stealing money. Her acute attention to people, environments and situations allows her to strongly adapt to each scenario and reap in the biggest reward possible without raising awareness to policing forces. Her natural talent heavily implies Moses' potentiality as her father, given he is also well-equipped with deception and subterfuge. Yet Sargent's stupendously heartwarming screenplay avoids this arc as the central plot point, instead opting for an exploration in the differing maturities of Addie and \"Moze\". Addie smoking cigarettes whilst tucked up in bed, although regrettably an action that has not aged well in the slightest, and Moze hypnotised by the \"exotic dancer\" Miss Trixie Delight. Intelligently, this rampart contrast produced a fast-moving pace that even a Model 68 convertible could not overtake.Paper Moon, at its core, is superfluous. Yet it's with this one-dimensionality that Sargent's humorous dialogue decorates its characters with nutritious strength, marking it as a superlative screenplay that sits among the best ever written. The introductory caf\u00e9 exchange cements this notion by outlining the plot's calculative business repetition whilst embedding characterised dominance between both individuals that conjures the required hilarity. It never lets go. Bogdanovich's honest approach creating an affecting portrait of poverty-stricken America simultaneously.Undoubtedly, the real-life pairing of Ryan and Tatum O'Neal perpetuated the onscreen chemistry to incalculable heights, particularly with their interactions. A connection that may not have been possible from two differing actors. Tatum's extraordinary young performance, which garnered her the youngest recipient of the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award, was nothing short of exceptional. From the smart quips to the expressionistic facial movements. She unequivocally matched her father's performance, whom was equally as flawless with his stern yet friendly characteristics. Kov\u00e1cs' monochromatic cinematography, accentuating the bleak outlook of \"The Great Depression\", paid tribute to features of the 30s and 40s. Extensive uninterrupted dialogue exchanges and unwrinkled tracking shots of automobiles driving across the barren countryside.These empty environments may identify with the plot's overall simplicity, however that should not detract from Paper Moon's effectiveness as an entertaining mismatched road-trip comedy. For what it lacks in profoundness, Sargent's delightful screenplay makes up for in joyous enjoyability. Watching a real father and daughter connect through a cinematic experience, transforming this apparent thinly constructed moon into a bright sunny day.",

Many reviewers have already said that they felt as if they were actually watching a 30s movie with the black and white cinematography and the landscape depicting depression-era America. I saw Peter Bogdanovich's interview and it tells how he went to great pains to make sure that every little detail was just as it might have been during that time. He did a super job with it. And the story was good, too. And it was kind of refreshing to see a child being portrayed as something other than a precocious cute little kid. Addie was every bit as strong-willed and cunning as Mose. in fact probably more so. She had Mose taking chances he otherwise wouldn't have taken and somehow always ended up on top of every sticky situation they got themselves into. And what director in this day and age would have the nerve to show a nine year old child driving a car and smoking cigarettes? I wasn't alive during the Depression, but my parents were, and I'm pretty sure this was the way kids acted back then. Great movie. Brings a smile to my face every time.

The argument in the cafe at the start of their relationship is brilliant. She tends to steal every scene she is in, but Ryan O'Neil is wonderful in the role of the conman, smooth and charming throughout.The film itself looks stunning, in glorious black and white the stark landscapes of America's Midwest look magnificent even on a small screen and there's plenty of them as the pair travel across the land. There is a wonderful sugar coated feeling to much of the film, despite the depression era setting and the very fact that the girl has lost her mother and the man is a conman. It never gets depressing or bogged down in sentiment. I did struggle once Madeline Kahn's character entered the film. Usually I adore her, she was a fine comedic actor, but in this I felt she imposed on the storyline instead of adding to it. I felt it detracted from the relationship between Moses and Addie and I was glad Addie got rid of her.This is a fine film and deserves the acclaim it has and is a joy to watch.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com",

Ryan O'Neill looks great and plays an excellent straight man to his daughter, Tatum, who is irresistible.The casting is brilliant. The widows to whom he sells Bibles look as if they are right out of \"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.\" They look real without seeming freakish.To me, Madeleine Kahn is a slightly wrong note for just this reason: She seems like a movie actress doing shtick. Of course O'Neill looks like a movie star and he was a big star. But he plays it down. Tatum is astonishingly natural. She plays the character's humor with \u00e9lan and her poignancy like a seasoned actress.It's stylishly filmed and directed and -- well, it's a treat.",

            "content": "1st watched 7/15/2011 -- 7 out of 10 (Dir-Peter Bogdanovich): Sweet and whimsical story about a young girl and her acquaintance with a midwest swindler who con their way across a couple of states back in the depression days of the 1930's. This movie stars the real-life father and daughter team of Ryan and Tatum O'Neal(in her first role) and was directed by the excellent director, Peter Bogdanovich. The story starts at a gravesite where Addie's(Tatum's character) mother is being buried. Ryan's character arrives to console the family and offers to take the daughter(whose only surviving family member is in Missouri) to her sister's place. Of course, he ends up using her to collect some money and nobody really knows if he really knew the mother or not. He introduces Addie to his bible-salesman routine where he visits recently deceased locals surviving members and bribes them into purchasing an engraved Bible. Addie starts becoming part of the scam and agrees to team-up with him. The couple exchange plenty of banter and the movie brings a lot of laughs early in the picture. After they spend some time with a lady friend named Trixie Delight, played by Madeline Kahn, the movie turns around and becomes a little more serious. Addie cons to get rid of Trixie and then they get involved with bootlegging with a little more serious consequences -- if they get caught. The movie is entertaining, for the most part, and before it's over you start caring for these characters and want them to stay together. This unique father/daughter film is very much worth the viewing despite the turn to the serious-side near the end and their film coupling has never been repeated since.",

            "content": "I came into viewing this knowing about Tatum's Oscar performance, and she doesn't disappoint. She's utterly fascinating to watch. There are several layers to appreciate here. The fundamental one is that of the actors delivering lines. But on top of this you have the natural father-daughter pairing. On top of that, you have the film's meta-story: the ambiguity of whether Moses really is Addie's 'Paw'. Time has added yet another layer -- that of real-life friction between parent and child that we know about in advance of seeing this.We get the most obvious part, the charm of the plot. But we also get the treat of watching Tatum and Ryan trying to best each other on two levels: on that of who's the better con artist, and on that of which actor's presence controls the picture. And this is where Bogdanovich makes it interesting. For almost the entire narrative, the camera takes the child's point of view. Everything from the swindling of the $200 inheritance to the confidence game with the Bibles to the 'wrassling' match, and so on, is seen with her eyes. We expect Addie's vision will prevail. But Bogdanovich takes advantage of our confidence by then splitting the narrative between two points of view. In the end, it comes down not to 'resolving the plot', but to making us invest in the emotional payoff.Absolutely recommended viewing here. Be sure to see \"Sweet and Lowdown\" as well. The connection is rich and worthwhile.",

I first saw it when I was about the same age as Tatum O'Neal, and I was absolutely thrilled by the adventures she was having in this film. I've since watched it many times, and the magic in the movie remains undiminished.The film is set in the American midwest during the Depression years. Philandering Moses (Ryan O'Neal) winds up saddled with young orphan Addie (Tatum O'Neal) when he attends her mother's funeral. When she learns that he is a con man, she proves herself to be a shrewd and capable accomplice, and the two of them form a partnership. When Moses' tendency to chase after questionable women becomes a challenge to the status quo, Addie must take action to ensure that her life with Moses remains unthreatened.In terms of a believable performance by a kid, I can't think of many others that have come close to Tatum O'Neal in this movie. The photography is astonishing as well. The bleak dusty landscapes in the movie are breathtaking in black & white, and the period sets are memorable, too. All of the actors in the film hit the perfect note, right down to the bit parts and extras, although the main players are marvelous. Madeline Kahn is great, as usual, and so is P.J. Johnson as her overworked personal maid.\"Paper Moon\" gives you the impression that this really is what America might have been like in this time period. It would be worth seeing just for the sheer craft of the film alone, but the story and the acting make it ten times better than just that. Truly deserves the highest rating a film can get.",

But if you examine the passage of time, the 70s to us are what the Great Depression was to the 70s. Give or take a few years, so it isn't so extraordinary. I think one of the more amazing things about this movie is how the physical landscape of the Midwest hadn't really changed all that much, so that by simply putting vintage autos on the road, dressing people up properly, and shooting it in black and white, it all looks so damn authentic. Be hard to pull that off today. The great Lazlo Kovacs works his trademark magic throughout with his photography. Ryan O'Neal, who was always treated as somewhat of a joke when I was a kid, is fantastic. How they got this performance out of Tatum, I still can't understand.

Paper Moon is different from other con drama because no con drama ever had a child doing the notorious and conning stuff. That brings an innocence in the script and a film set in depression era instanly becomes delightful. I have a particular hatred for every film where the lead character is seen doing bad and Evil stuff but Paper Moon comes as an exception just like some selected classic films from negative genre had became one. I couldn't hate the two leading character of the film, rather i enjoyed their trickings. And believe it or not the cute little child is father of con-course. Paper Moon is a story of a con man Moses and a child Addie who forge a partnership to hunt down people. These two make a strong team but doesn't feel respected to each other but expectedly by the end they gain emotions for each other. The screenplay is highly engaging and entertaining that keeps this film interesting for entire 100 minutes. Ryan O'neal plays his part well but the child Tatum O'neal stays in the film from the first frame and steals the entire show. The way she improvises situations and tricks people is so freaking funny and clever, i loved it. I am gonna remember every when the child literally ate up all the elder characters with her innocence and natural act. After fast paced 70 minutes the film loses a little bit while moving towards the climax and somehow survives those predictable plotting. And when you feel like having a predictable climax it goes other way around to make it intelligently sentimental. Peter Bogdanovich's direction is very good throughout the narrative, though, he could have added more and set the benchmark for other films made on the same topic. Overall, a FUN-TASTIC film and yes a recommendable material.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",

Ryan, however, is a slick con man who needs to make some money along the way and soon Tatum is caught up in the scams as well.Madeline Kahn leads a strong supporting cast as a slutty woman Ryan meets at a carnival and brings her and her servant along for the ride. The sequence where Tatum and the servant conspire to split them up is done brilliantly with precision timing. This is what great comedy is all about.Director Peter Bogdanovich wisely filmed \"Paper Moon\" in black and white. It adds to the total ambiance of the period. Shooting in color would have been less effective.Ryan O'Neal gives his best performance as con man Moses Pray. He swindles recently widowed women out of money by selling bibles he claims were ordered by the deceased prior to their deaths. Naturally there are other, smaller cons that Tatum not only takes part in, but also initiates as well. Things go well until they try to sell a moonshiner his own moonshine!!\nAgain I can't stress enough how great Tatum O'Neal is in this film. She is absolutely adorable and even more so when she gets tough with Ryan. It is said that Bogdanovich manipulated her performance until it was what he wanted. If that was the case then directors should take note. I think this is the best performance (Oscar winning to boot) ever given by a child on film. This is a great motion picture.",

Peter Bogdonovich, in a tribute to the old masters, has created the feel, and look of a 1930's film. With a flawless cast headed by Ryan O'Neal and his wonderfully spunky daughter Tatum, he has reminded us of how good comedy can be.Both of the O'Neals play well off of each other. I believe that Ryan O'Neal was by far a much better comedic actor than dramatic actor. Tatum is absolutely delightful as the little girl who may or may not be his real daughter.Bogdonovich, like John Ford, had a stable of excellent supporting actors that he would use over and over again, and they all appear here in fine form. Madeline Kahn from \"What's Up, Doc?\" is his buxom love interest, for a time. John Hillerman is wonderful in the twin roles of bootlegger and town sheriff. And Randy Quaid, who appeared in \"The Last Picture Show\", shows up for a small but genuinely funny role as a local farm boy.When the film was first released, it was not a big hit, but it has endured.

Initially hesitant to trust another, these two quickly begin to see admirable qualities in one another and end up caring for one each other.That relationship is the best aspect of the film, no doubt, but I also really like the setting. The two drive through Midwestern states, from one little town to another, and things are tough. Not everyone has even enough money to eat and here is Moses pulling cons left and right, and it's nice to see how Addie starts to work as his conscience. All the supporting characters are colourful and memorable, leaving a clear impact, even though very few of them are in the movie for long.If I had to nitpick, I guess I could point out that the film is rather episodic in nature. Not all little segments are as good as the others, but they're all still pretty good. And the ones that really work are fantastic.Very nice film.

Mose drops by at the funeral of a woman he once knew and in attendance at the funeral is the woman's daughter Addie. Mose agrees to drive Addie to her auntie's house in St Joseph. Addie is a bright girl and spots what Mose is all about and decides to get in on the act much to the annoyance of Mose. However, as things progress an uneasy bond develops between man and girl...Delightful is a great word to describe a film such as Paper Moon; although it gets off to a bit of a slow start once the world's most unlikely grifting duo set to work the film is very funny. Addie is bold, confident, assertive and smart and you feel that Mose doesn't quite know how to handle her at first. What's also funny is despite the fact that she is only 9 years old, she never gets intimidated by Mose and won't let him push her around which only frustrates and angers Mose more and more (she's not atypical of a child of that era which was refreshing to see).Perhaps the fact that Mose and Addie were real life father and daughter helped bring the wonderful chemistry to the screen. Whilst Ryan O'Neal is good in this film, it is Tatum O'Neal that gets all the best lines and steals many of the scenes. Some of the things she comes out with are absolute gems. My personal favourite was when Mose says to her \"I have scruples I bet you don't know what they are.\" and she replies \"No I don't know what they are, but if you've got them then I bet they belong to someone else.\" A genius exchange of dialogue in one of the film's many hilarious scenes.Perhaps the only minor criticism I have with the film was the segment involving Miss Trixie; it seemed to slow things down and wasn't all that funny; Miss Trixie was more annoying than funny.Bogdanovich has captured the depression era well and the black and white cinematography was a nice touch as well.Paper Moon is a great film with the O'Neal's providing us with one of cinema's greatest double acts whilst also bringing some of the best character chemistry ever brought to the screen. It's funny, but there's also some tender moments as well. Definitely one to check out.",

The two girls have instant chemistry and they cook up a fun scheme to get rid of Kahn.Then in Act III we're treated to John Hillerman, who really nails his role as a lawman.

A youthful looking con artist named Moses Pray (Ryan O'Neal) teams up with a doleful, nine-year-old girl, Addie (Tatum O'Neal). Together, man and girl trek through Depression-era Kansas and Missouri in an old car, selling bibles.But though the story premise is clever, the plot and dialogue seem contrived. And the Addie character is not remotely believable. She is way too precocious for someone so young. Her hotel plan regarding Trixie (Madeline Kahn) is so intricate that even some bright adults would be hard-pressed to think of it. And her quick, off-the-cuff verbal responses don't jibe with her age or her background. Further, her annoyingly dour and manipulative attitude renders her unappealing.Despite this, the film's ambiance is wonderful. Scratchy, emaciated sounding music of the 1930s, withered costumes and prod design, on-location filming in Kansas, and B&W deep focus cinematography from Laszlo Kovacs combine to exude a sense of realism both in place and time. The tone is one of underlying sadness.Visual and music realism is the strength of this film. The script in general and the dialogue and Addie character in particular are the weaknesses. \"Paper Moon\" is a good film to watch for its nostalgic appeal. The era and the hardships it wrought give us a sense of perspective, especially compared to the excesses of our modern world.",

My only two faults with the pictures is I believe Peter Bogdonovich could have avoided putting Tatum in such situations as smoking a cigarette and some other adult scenes. My other fault with the film involves a decision that the lead actor played by Tatum's father Ryan O'Neil makes toward the end of the film leading to his downfall, though it does introduce us to one of the great and now often forgotten comedic actors of our time Randy Quaid.Ryan O'Neil does a very good job and without him we wouldn't have had Tatum.

The film was called \"Paper Moon\" and it starred her real life father Ryan O'Neal and was directed by Peter Bogdanovich and released by Paramount Pictures. However,this film is set during the depression plague Midwest of the 1930's,and stars Ryan O'Neal as a likable con-artist in the 1930's Midwest Depression,and his real-life daughter,Tatum O'Neal is outstanding as his nine-year-old partner in the film-flam business. Joesph David Brown's novel \"Addie Pray\",was the basis of the adaptational screenplay by Alvin Sargent. The story begins with a funeral,where O'Neal arrives late to a memorial service of a woman who was,or wasn't(as he claims),his wife,who has left a child of undetermined parentage but most determined character. Figuring to promote some fast money from the locals for the kid,O'Neal finds the child more than adapt in the shiftly arts of selling bibles to widows. Locked in an uneasy but increasingly affectionate partnership,the O'Neals wend their way through the Kansas-Missouri farmlands and staying within one step ahead of the local authorities and other crooks and thieves. Prominent is the large cast which includes Madeline Khan(Oscar Nominated in 1973 for Best Supporting Actress),who is excellent as an carny stripper who captivates Ryan O'Neal,and John Hillerman who plays a lefty here.",

Instead, and fortunately, it's a character-driven film that doesn't rely on pulling the rug from under your feet, even though the lowlife characters are constantly trying to fool others. It's the dynamic between its two primary characters that make it work. Ryan O'Neal is otherwise a pretty bland actor, but he's thoroughly compelling as a slimy charmer with a compassionate side. He takes the whole film under his wing, though it's not necessarily a great performance, just one that suits the circumstance. I'm not sure why Tatum O'Neal won an Oscar besides perhaps out of the category fraud. She has a few good moments but is otherwise vacant compared to her father. The writing is tight and economic, almost to a point where it's left me too hungry for more time with the characters and info on their backgrounds. Can a script be too efficient? Its crisp black and white cinematography conjures a nostalgic yet volatile world but even so, Paper Moon is lots of fun, with a bond you can invest in.8/10",

            "content": "The first frame of the picture starts with a song entitled \"It's Only A Paper Moon\" and when the opening titles came on screen, the film felt reminiscent of a Woody Allen film, but in respect Bogdanovich had gone to extreme lengths of trying to pay homage to the great film maestro Orson Welles. I would have to concur that the cinematography and the credit for the use of deep focus should be credited to James Wong Howe who started an experimental process as far back as 1925, since he was experimenting with camera lenses and lighting to make sequences stand out in the pictures. The film then went on to tell the story of a bible salesman, and just as he was making his sales with a satisfactory customer, he notices an adolescent girl that wants to learn the trick of the trade in selling bibles as part of a con job. One thing that I will note that makes this film a grand masterpiece is the use of black and white cinematography, popular songs in the background as the film's score, the performances by Ryan O'Neal and his daughter Tatum are superb, as well as Madeline Kahn in an Oscar-nominated performance. Another positive aspect about this film is the direction that Bogdanovich outlays from story, character development, and conveying the feel and look of the era of the Great Depression. I saw this film nearly 4 to 5 years ago on DVD, there are some cons to this film, that can make it a bit problematic, first is the length, I understand that the film is long and that when there is not much action, your mind cannot take the stress of too much dialogue sequences, which is what I felt whilst watching this movie. I also felt that some of the sequences like when Ryan O'Neal is out with the Tatum O'Neal in the middle of the town in Texas is a bit antiquated when she ends up getting lost and Ryan had to search all over the area to find her. But, I do have some positive things to say about the camera angles and shots used in the film, for the sequence when Ryan O'Neal is talking to the mechanic at a train station if you look carefully at the far left of the screen, of the open window right behind the man in the train station, you can see two girls playing out back in clear view. It is distracting and takes the focus away from the story, but it is pretty awesome to see something like that in a film such as this. I like the film, and it's a story that has been used in modern films and TV shows to provide inspiration like \"Suite Life of Zack and Cody\" when they re-used the same story but to con the people in the hotel. That's what I feel about this movie, a grand masterpiece from Peter Bogdanovich.",

They play against each other well, being father and daughter in real life, and create some truly memorable scenes together including an excellent scene where Ryan O'Neal's character argues with the young girl Addy in a restaurant over money. It's a scene that manages to linger and proves the incredible filmmaking ability of Peter Bogdonavich who drives this film with incredible directing. The film is presented in a noir motif with 1930's visual and even a black and white presentation to further imrove the authenticity of the time period. Madeline Khan gives a brief but hilarious performance as a stipper who helps move the story into some great territory. Unfortunately, the story is muddled down in the second half with a less than satisfying ending that is cute, but completely off-set by the mood already established at the beginning.

The first in 1971 was \"The Last Picture Show\" & the second in 1973 was \"Paper Moon\". Set in the depression-hit USA of the 1930's Paper Moon was shot in black & white film for cinematic effect & on location in Kansas & Missouri. Ryan O'Neal plays Moses Pray a con-man who sells bibles to recently-deceased widows after reading the obituary columns in newspapers. His modus operandi is to inform the widows that just before they died their husbands had ordered the de luxe version of his merchandise with his wife's name embossed on the cover. Naturally, they are only too happy to pay an over-the-top price for a momento of their late husbands. O'Neal's precocious real-life daughter Tatum deservedly won an Oscar for her performance as a young girl Addie Loggins. After the death of her mother who Moses knew & attended her funeral, he is put upon to take her to live with her aunt in St. Joseph, Missouri. After Moses drops the girl off at her aunt's house she immediately decides she will hate living there & quickly leaves. She runs out hoping to get with back Moses Pray & is lucky to find him still around just down the road after his car has broken down. He reluctantly takes her back & after initially disliking Addie eventually warms to the smart & stubborn young girl. Along the way Moses meets Trixie Delight played by Madeleine Khan who really was a delightful comedienne. Mel Brooks once said of her, \"Either as a stand-up comic or actress you cannot beat Madeleine Khan\". If you watch this film you will know why he said it. A confrontation between Trixie & Addie begins soon after they first meet. Moses naturally wants his new girlfriend to sit next to him on the front seat of his car when they hit the road, \"relegating\" Addie to the back seat. Addie won't comply & effectively goes on a \"sit-down strike\" refusing to move.Trixie tells Addie in her southern drawl, \"Just this once let Miss Trixie sit up front with her big tits\", to which Addie reluctantly agrees. After they stop at a motel Addie realises Trixie is fast using up the finances & using her wits conspires to terminate the relationship between Moses & Trixie. There is hardly a dull moment in \"Paper Moon\" & one more person is certainly worthy of mention, the cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs whose work is outstanding. Some of his long-distance shots taken in Kansas & Missouri are breath-taking. Highly recommended.",

            "review_title": "PAPER MOON : American Classic, Featuring Possibly The Best On- Screen Child Performance Ever...",
            "content": "PAPER MOON Peter Bogdanovich's 1972 classic is every bit as amusing and impressive today as it was when I first viewed it about 8 years ago. A film that embraces it's simplicity and creates a wonderfully entertaining piece of cinema in the style of the greatest classic Hollywood comedies.PAPER MOON tells the story of Addie (played by Tatum O'Neal... in what I find to be the best child performance ever captured on screen), a young girl who's mother just died leaving Addie with no family except relatives miles and miles away. Arriving at the funeral is Moze Pray (Ryan O'Neal), a stranger there to mourn the death of Addie's mother. However, both Addie and Moze get more than they bargained for when the stranger is forced to drive the young girl all the way to her Aunt's home.Along the ride, Addie's tough and mature exterior become more apparent and hard for Moze to ignore. Moze is a scam artist who has done very well for himself... but when Addie's natural instincts leads her towards the con artist ways as well, Moze can't deny the financial opportunity in pairing up with young Addie.They travel across Depression-era America pulling scams... and what starts off as a very business-oriented relationships slowly starts to turn into something a little more. It's essentially a buddy-road movie, with the added depth of a complicated father-daughter dynamic.Now today it might seem gimmicky to cast a major Hollywood star opposite his inexperienced daughter in a major Hollywood film... however, Peter Bogdanovich manages to drain nothing but positive qualities out of this potential \"gimmick\". The chemistry between Ryan and Tatum is like nothing I've seen on film depicting this type of relationship. They are two actors completely committed to their characters, but the relationship they had outside of the film fortifies every strength. The divisive levels of love, admiration, loathing, dependence, independence, and desperation felt by both Addie and Moze are always apparent... and neither O'Neal falters a step.Also along for the ride is Madeline Kahn in a hysterical supporting role as Trixie Delight. A prostitute who thinks of herself as anything but... and who Moze becomes very fond of. Kahn's comedic timing and skill as one of the screen's greatest comedic actresses ever is never more apparent then when she is arguing with Addie following their picnic.Ryan O'Neal is at the top of his game as Moses Pray. On many levels, you can sense how resistant Moze is to give in to Addie's charms, and any affection he shows her also contains an element of disdain... however, he can't help but be won over by Addie's ballsy charm.And neither can the audience... young Tatum O'Neal steals this picture with what appears to be virtually no effort. She glides through the film oozing unbelievable charm. Whether Tatum O'Neal has lived up to the promise she showed here or not is irrelevant in terms of this performance. Aside from her charm and sheer likability, she also offers a performance with a great deal of nuance. Despite her likability, Tatum manages to keep the audience aware that Addie is a sad/lonely girl at heart who just longs for some paternal affection... and she'll take it in whatever form she can at first. Addie is a young girl who would never accept anything less than exactly what she wants... and Tatum O'Neal is wonderful. Without a doubt she deserves the title of \"Youngest Competitive Oscar Winner In Acting\". This is a timeless performance that is more then just a child with star quality... this is Tatum's finest hour as an actress.PAPER MOON is the kind of film that relies so heavily on the chemistry between it's two leads that it's hard to review the film without gushing primarily about the performances... but I must say that the film is generally flawless on every level. The dialogue is perfectly tart and sarcastic... yet also very true to the time period and the characters. The insults and zingers feel real, but they also somehow manage to come from a sensitive/heartfelt place. And Bogdonavich's direction is spot-on... from the choice to shoot in Black & White to the casting to the pacing... this is a true classic.PAPER MOON absolutely must be watched by all film fans who are looking to witness some of the greatest screen chemistry captured on film... but it is also a must see for the simplistic perfection that it is as a whole....

            "content": "Director Peter Bogdanovich was on a real roll in the early 70s what with \"The Last Picture Show,\" \"What's Up, Doc?\" and then 1973's \"Paper Moon,\" a thoroughly clever, engagingly sharp period comedy adapted from the novel \"Addie Pray\" by Joe David Brown.  Focusing on a slick, small-scale con artist who finds more than he bargains for after being saddled with a feisty little orphan, \"Paper Moon\" may be slightly reminiscent to Shirley Temple's \"Little Miss Marker\" by nature, but it's certainly not similar in attitude or style. Ryan O'Neal has never been more ingratiating than as the aptly-named Moses Pray, a sly, charming rogue who resorts to chicanery and  flimflammery for survival, targeting little old ladies whose husbands have just passed away. \"Moze\" sets up his victims via the obituary notices.  His con game consists of engraving bibles with the name of some dearly departed's widow, then showing up at the doorstep of the grievous wife and presenting her with the \"deluxe\" version of a bible that her late spouse supposedly \"ordered\" just prior to his death, asking, of course, for an outlandish price.  Inevitably, the old ladies cave in and pay out, touched by their husbands' significant \"gesture.\"Things are running fairly smoothly for Moze until scruffy little Addie Loggins shows up unannounced.  Addie, whose mother was just killed in a car accident, claims she has pretty good evidence that Moze, who had an affair with the mother, is her long-lost daddy and now expects to be reimbursed for certain expenses.  The angry, flustered Moze denies the paternity accusation but reluctantly agrees to pay her off after his next few scams and drive her across the state line to her nearest unknown relatives...but, that's it! And now the good stuff starts...It's uphill most of the way for this mirthful, beautifully realized entertainment as Moze and little Addie, who becomes an expert partner-in-crime, scam their way through the Kansas heartland.  Ryan O'Neal's keen comedy instincts are on all four burners here, but never at the expense of his character or the film's intentions.  As he earlier demonstrated in \"What's Up, Doc?\", he knows exactly where to draw the line, showing expert skill at \u0091slow burn' comedy, especially in his scenes with the flinty, steadfast little Addie.The surprise, of course, is neophyte Tatum O'Neal, Ryan's real-life daughter, whose first film this was.  As the obstinate, worldly, cigarette-smoking waif who could out-curse a sailor, the Oscar-winning Tatum steals practically every scene she's in.  A cross between Little Orphan Annie and Wallace Beery, she lights up the screen so naturally and unaffectedly.  The casting of both father and daughter is not only inspired but absolutely sublime, possibly the funniest grownup/kid interplay since W.C. Fields and Baby LeRoy. And if that wasn't enough, you have the delectable Madeline Kahn as the frisky, flirtatious Trixie Delight, a carnival cooch dancer who moves in on Addie's territory \u0096 that is, Moze \u0096 half way through the film.  The late, plummy-voiced Kahn, an expert comedy farceur, will keep you rolling in the aisles as she barnstorms her way right into Moze's front seat while disrupting the team's money-making roll, leaving an increasingly peeved Addie no choice but to nip the hotsy-totsy little affair in the bud.  Young P.J. Johnson turns in a wonderfully sullen, deadpan perf as Imogene, part of Miss Trixie's \"entourage.\"  Chief maid and luggage carrier for the unappreciative Miss Trixie, Imogene's disdain for her boss is no secret, comparing her at one point to white specks on chicken droppings.  One of the film's highlights is watching Addie and Imogene, in cahoots, cook up and carry out a scheme to split up the adults.The movie loses a bit of steam toward the end with a somewhat less-involving subplot dealing with bootleggers and a corrupt sheriff (John Hillerman), but it's certainly not enough to hurt the genuine appeal of the film.  Careful attention has been paid to the look and feel of this film, which is greatly enhanced by the stunning midwest landscape (shot impressively, like \"The Last Picture Show\", in black-and-white), and  period-perfect incidentals, which give the film a wonderfully authentic 30s feel.Unfortunately, Bogdanovich's career took an unexpected and momentous nosedive after this film.  So, perhaps in retrospect, \"Paper Moon\" becomes a wonderful valentine to better days and a loving tribute to a once budding genius.Sheer delight.",

After all that time, I still remembered a surprising amount of it. It's a fun film set in the Depression about a con artist getting together through odd circumstances with a 9 year old girl who may be better at it than him and also very possibly his daughter. I can't say it's laugh out loud funny very often, but it will put a smile on your face. Ryan O'Neal, not among our greatest thespians, was pretty good in a few films and this was one of them, however the lead in this is his daughter, Tatum, in her film debut and she is quite entertaining. I bet they had difficulties filming this as now and then you can almost see them trying to suppress smiling. It's one of Peter Bogdanovich's better films and it is indeed enjoyable. Tatum O'Neal became the youngest Oscar winner in history for this and that is the only serious issue I have with the film. First off, there is barely a scene in the film in which she is not in it. Her Oscar was for supporting actress and the reality is everyone else is supporting her. She is the enjoyable star of this, but this is not among the great child performances of all time and her win was an insult to a truly marvelous supporting performance given by the great Madeline Kahn. I still remember the look of dissatisfaction on her face when she lost to this child on Oscar night and it was deserved. Besides Kahn, the funniest performance comes from another sterling supporting performance by P. J. Johnson. These two were the ones who made me laugh out loud. O'Neal is another one of Oscar's many errors, but that's surely no reason to avoid this. This is fun.",

I heard another comparison to Ed Wood, which strikes me as way more accurate - they're both black and white to feel more accurate to the time period they're set in, they're both fairly dialogue heavy, and they're both so goddamn sweet.I don't know whose idea it was to cast Ryan O'Neal's actual daughter in the role of his (possibly) on screen daughter, but whoever it was deserves a medal and then some. They're both bloody fantastic, but it's a pretty rare thing to be able to say that the child performance in any given film can actually outshine the adult on occasion. But holy hell, she does. It's even better saying that given that when she got her first lines, I thought she was really going to annoy me, but nope. She was amazing.She couldn't have done that without a really great script though, and she got that too, because the two main characters bounce off each other really well, both in dialogue and performance. This does unfortunately mean that the part of the film where they pick up the carnival dancer isn't all that interesting to me, because I don't really like that character and there isn't much of the two leads left on their own to do what they do best.Thankfully, the pace does pick up again at a certain point, and the last half an hour or so of the film is amazing. The performances are brilliant though, even from the two characters I don't like all that much, and if you can ignore that the people looking after Addie in the beginning just hand her over to some random dude who claims he once knew her mother (that's certainly one way to get your plot started I suppose), I can't really complain about anything in the narrative. And did I mention how it's just so goddamn cute?I also think it's directed and shot pretty well, there's some stunning landscape shots and also just...images in general, and Did. I. Mention that it's adorable?It's such a nice change in tone from stuff I've been watching recently, so if you also need something that feels nice, simple, and good-hearted, you could do a hell of a lot worse than this.",

There is some eccentricity in the storyline, its very catchy and entertaining but at the same time absolutely unassuming and unpredictable. Normally you would always be amazed to see how many times you wanted certain things to happen during the movie but it is so practical that you realise that you are assuming too much of romanticism in the world which seldom exists and thats why the plot is near perfect! Still the movie continues to entertain you, its neither a happy romanticised dream nor a tragedy but its the slug fit between these two ends of the drama.\nThe acting and on screen chemistry of real life father daughter duo is phenomenal and certainly Tatum O'neal amazes as a child actor. The movie explores certain dimensions of those delicate and subtle human emotions of love which you long to express but cannot due to situations.\nIts definitely impressive movie with a perfect acting, plot, settings and direction which made me revise its rating to a perfect 10 from 9 as I couldn't stop thinking about it for long time!",

            "content": "Going back to a time when the common man and woman were susceptible to the depths of human dishonesty, Paper Moon takes a hilarious look at conartistry andthe complications that come with it. Ryan O'Neal stars as Moses Pray, a con man who bilks widows out of their money with his Bible-selling scam. On his way to another city to do more \"business\", he hears that a \"lady friend\" of his passed away and left behind a 9 year-old daughter (O'Neal's real-life daughter, Tatum) named Addie Loggins. As Moses pays his respects, a neighbor asks him to to take Addie to her only known relatives in Missouri. The events that occur between the two until the end of the movie is comical movie magic in the madcap tradition of Wheeler and Woolsey. The laughs extend from police chases to a wrestling match between O'Neal and Randy Quaid, plus hilarious support from Madeline Kahn (Oscar-nominated) as Trixie Delight and P.J. Johnson as Imogene. Tatum, in her film debut, became the youngest actor ever to win a competitive Oscar for her excellent performance. ****",

            "content": "This is a first in a project I am attempting that is to review every film I see.1973 was a very good year for cinema. Two of cinemas greats made two of the best films every made. Martin Scorsese and Terence Malick each made their forays into cinema with ' Mean Streets ' and 'Badlands ' respectively. Also made in that year was Peter Bogdanovich's film ' Paper Moon '.In 2010 most people might know him as the guy who appeared in an episode of the sitcom ' How I Met Your Mother ' but back in the 70's he was a director of \" New Hollywood \". He belonged to a group of directors that made different kinds of movies . Like the French and German new wave.Paper moon is a simple movie with simple dialogs. It is not full of metaphors or existential dialog or the philosophical musings that are part of Bergman's films. It is at it's simplest a road movie. It has all the delights of a road movie. Interesting characters and good relationships. It is very hard to make Paper Moon. It is very hard to make a movie with a heart. Movies like Amelie and Paper Moon can go horribly wrong and end up like some extremely melodramatic and over the top Hollywood tearjerker.However Paper Moon succeeds. Why does it succeed ? The great chemistry in the film by the father - daughter pair. The beautiful photography but mostly because the director cares for his characters.We could all be hating Moses. Moses is a guy who sells Bibles to widows for a living. But somehow we overlook this fact . We take delight in him along with his daughter swindling all and sundry and traversing the road of America. But good times do not last. There has to be some conflict and a final resolution. One of the reviewers commented on how this movie never ages and that is quite true. I could see myself watching this movie twenty years from now. The freshness of this movie will never leave it. It is ironic that the director commented that this movie had aged before it had released. Maybe that is true. It retains the 1930 ' s look . It retains the depression era feel but it juxtaposes it with such beauty and warmth that in the end you have a big goofy and contented smile.",

            "content": "Paper Moon tells the story of a young girl named Addie Loggins(Tatum O'Neal) whose recently lost her mother in depression era America. During her mothers funeral she meets a small time con-man named Moses Pray(played by her real-life father Ryan O'Neal) who may or may not be her father. After initially refusing to take her to her aunts to live, he is pressured by the neighbours at the funeral to take her himself.The first thing i have to talk about is the incredible set design and cinematography, WOW!! This film really does look like it's been taken straight from the 1920's. Whilst that seems like a false compliment, it really isn't. I can't remember the last time I've been so immersed, and have fully believed in a (fictional)film world. The film not only has richly detailed window dressing, it also has a-lot of depth especially with the two central characters of the film.Obviously the chemistry between Addie and Moses was going to be great since they're father and daughter in real-life. This aspect really plays well in the film, the relationship between the two characters is a joy to watch. The film also has a-lot of genuinely laugh out load moments between the two as they bicker between themselves, especially when Addie gets in on Moses's bible selling con business, in-which he targets widows with a 'personalised' bible from their recently departed spouses, as a way to make a couple of bucks. She goes from giving free copy's to poor families, only then to hike the price three-fold to rich widows, alongside Moses's exasperated facial reactions, which are hilarious.The film's screenplay is well written, there wasn't any section in the film I wasn't completely invested in. I was constantly engaged in the wonderfully fleshed out characters especially Addie(for which Tatum O'Neal won an Oscar at the grand old age of 9). Both characters are given moments of strength and weakness. The film also manages to stay away from being overly sentimental, even the ending is somewhat poignant.Paper Moon is the first film iv'e seen from director Peter Bogdanovich, and it has already left a lasting impression on me. The way Bogdanovich is able to bridge the gap between classic Hollywood and the 70's American new wave Is absolutely incredible, and at times seems almost effortless. At the end of the day Paper Moon is essentially another road movie, but thanks to it's incredible cinematography, multi-layered characters and brilliant acting, it elevates itself above the majority of films in the genre.",

An American friend, while I was over there, made me watch it as he knew I loved 'The Last Picture Show'.What I saw unfold before me was an adorable film, shot and crafted lovingly. It has for me, all of the key elements that are required to make movies exceptional. The storyline is engaging, the acting is brilliant and the photography is beautiful. My one gripe about the film is that it has a big flat spot in the middle. Addy's detailed plan and execution to get rid of Trixie takes a little more time than it ought to. It then leads to the lengthy scene introducing us to the bootlegers.What follows though is one of my favourite moments in cinema. The build up of the whole story that leads us to the finale. My heart was pounding throughout the chase sequence which sees Moze run down a blind alley - a bit of a cinematic clich\u00e9, but never handled better in my opinion. Addy waits for Moze, but is he really coming? It's fantastic! [Fans of the film 'LEON' should see 'Paper Moon', it clearly influenced Luc Besson's modern classic. Many moments are replicated - the child smoking, the child who knows better and even the ending. Leon and Moze both go down blind alleys when they are supposed to be at a meeting point. The outcome is different, but the set up is the same. Cinematic ally, it works like a charm.]The final scene in 'Paper Moon' between Addy and Moze is perfect. It verges on sentimentality, but no sentimental dialogue transpires - In fact the dialogue is in opposition to how they feel. The visual story does the work and that is what I love most about this film.The elements counter act each other. The acting drives the story and vice versa. The photography is gorgeous and tells the visual story with such detail that it could reduce me to tears. The photography never overpowers the characters, but it gives us a different relationship between Addy and Moze than their dialogue does. The photography and the subtle visual acting is what tells us how much they love each other, not their dialogue. My favourite type of film-making.All in all a must see movie and good enough for me to have sent to America for a copy. (region 2 is unavailable.)Big flat spot in the middle but cinematic genius for the rest. 9 out of 10",

            "content": "Paper Moon is based on the novel \"Addie Pray\" by Joe David Brown who was a writer, son of a preacher man and learned confidence games while growing up. The screenplay was written by Alvin Sargent who is still alive and I found this quote from Alvin, \"When I die, I'm going to have written on my tombstone, 'Finally, a plot'.\" Originally the film version was to star Paul Newman and his daughter Nell Potts (you might recognize her from the food company label they started together), but that changed when the original director John Huston bowed out and was replaced by the hot new director Peter Bogdanovich. Peter has always been one of my heroes. Bogdanovich said his father used to take him to see retrospectives of silent films and he got hooked on visual story telling. Peter said he watched over 7,000 movies while growing up. As a teenage he went from buff to writer, to archive programmer, to script doctor and assistant director. He was a high school drop out that parlayed his love of film into a life long vocation. He wrote about forgotten classic films, interviewed and befriended many great directors and stars then decided to make his own moving pictures. Born and raised in New York City Peter was told if he wanted to make movies he had to go where they were made, Hollywood. So in 1968 he bought an old car for $150 and drove cross country with his young wife Polly Platt and their one eyed dog named Puppy. The car overheated a lot so they looked for hills to coast down when they could. Polly pointed out that Kansas and Missouri were flat and void of trees, small towns and farms had changed very little. It looked a lot like it did during the Great Depression, and if they ever needed a depression movie location they should remember that. Once in Los Angeles producer Roger Corman asked Peter to direct his first film TARGETS that is if he could use Boris Karloff for the two days left on his contract, some stock footage and a recent news story about a crazed gun man shooting at strangers. TARGETS made enough money Peter made his next film with writer and D.C. bookstore owner Larry McMurtry \u2013 his second film was called THE LAST PICTURE SHOW and it was shot in black & white as a tribute to his then buddy legendary director John Ford. That highly regarded film became such a success that his third film was to be a tribute to another famous director and personal friend Howard Hawks. This remake of BRINGING UP BABY was called WHAT'S UP DOC? and it starred Barbara Streisand, Ryan O'Neil and a newcomer discovered by Bogdanovich the bouncy Madeline Kahn. What's Up Doc? came out while Last Picture Show was still playing in theaters so he had two films in Varieties list of top ten money makers that year. What's Up Doc? broke the 33 year old house record at Radio City Music Hall. Bogdanovich said, \"Cary Grant said to me, You go down there and stand in the back, and you listen and you watch while 6,500 people laugh at something you did. It will do your heart good.\" That was such a hit his fourth film was to be an epic western starring (get this) John Wayne, James Stewart and Henry Fonda that is until John Ford talked Wayne out of doing it after Ford become upset with the way Bogdanovich had treated his wife Polly Platt by starting an affair with his earlier discovery Cybil Shepard (his leading lady from Last Picture Show). Polly Platt had read the book ADDIE PRAY and told Peter he should make it as he could identify with the lead character because he had two daughters. In fact it was Platt who suggested casting Tatum O'Neal as the lead, Addie! To which Bogdanovich replied \"good\" then we could cast her father Ryan who he had just directed in WHAT'S UP DOC? and they could get Madeline Kahn again. In fact he re-wrote the script to get her character Trixie Delight back into the movie. But Peter didn't like the title of the novel \"Addie Pray\", and wasn't sure whether his new title \"Paper Moon\" was good enough; so he asked his mentor Orson Welles what he thought about it. Welles replied, \"That title is so good, you shouldn't even make the picture, just release the title!\" Orson, a close friend of director Peter Bogdanovich, did some uncredited consulting on the cinematography. It was Welles who suggested shooting black and white photography through a red filter, adding higher contrast to the images especially of the sky. Among his friends that he consulted when making Paper Moon were director John Ford to copy the look of his film GRAPES OF WRATH. (In Paper Moon you'll see families with broke down trucks on lone country roads.) He talked with his friend director Howard Hawks to get the feel of clever comedy dialogue as in Hawk's film HIS GIRL Friday. Back to the black & white cinematography. Bogdanovich loves CITIZEN KANE and claims one of the reasons it is so fascinating is the deep focus photography. So look for that in many scenes how every thing up close and far away \u2013 is in sharp, deep-focus at the same time. And the many long, long takes, where the camera, dialogue and the actors flow uninterrupted just like in real life. Locations, all real locations. Not one shot in a studio and it shows! Music, no new music was written for the film. All the music comes from radios or records and it's all authentic to the 1935 era. Finally it's fun and I hope you enjoy it!",

The two form a relationship and form a duo as they try to scam their way across America.We've seen the formula before but never as well done as this.  Tatum O'Neil playing Addie is unbelievable, switching from the cutest little girl, to a chain smoking devil in seconds.  At the start of the movie, you don't want to know, but by the end she has totally worked her way into your heart. The chemistry between her and her real-life father Ryan O'Neil is unbelievable and the scenes with the two of them bickering are an absolute treat.There are a couple of problems with the movie, a lot of people feel that the black & white picture is an asset, whereas I personally see it as a detrement.  I feel it detracts somewhat from the movie as a whole by dating it more than it needs to be.  Also the film is a little slow at the start.Overall this is a good film, perfect for a Saturday Afternoon.  Everyone should see this movie once. - 7/10",

The idea of a man travelling around with a young girl who may or may not be his daughter, which seemed so innocent and natural in the 70s, would now be treated with the utmost caution even if, as here, the actors were actual father and daughter.

Given the success of the both movies at the 1974 Oscars you would have to say yes (further, check out the Simpsons parody of grifting if you like the theme of these movies).Now Tatum O'Neil was great as Addie and her pa Jeff O'Neil did a great job a Mose. I loved Addies smoking and Mose's blindness to Trixie's obvious usury.However, I found the relationship between Addie and Mose a little more disturbing than most - perhaps this was the point of the movie. At times it really was more than fondness or kinship - Addie loved Mose - in a romantic way, or what she thought was romantic (which brought it out of the realm of disturbing). Given the fact that Mose could have been her Pa in real life, this had added a disturbing element to the movie. However, the movie needed the dark to balance the humour.Nevertheless, this movie was very easy to watch with great cinematography.

Centainly not in the current sexual sense of that word but Bogdanavich richly appropriated what the new scene, or part of the new scene, in SF was then also reviving: 30's music, black and white films, the chunky art deco titling scripts, the super trashy broad like Trixie Delight and the newfound nostalgia for the sensibilities of the whole Hollywood 1930s in general. I remember my friends buying the soundtrack and playing the fun music at the early stage of parties. We had never heard that bubbly music before and in the age of acid rock it seemed so fresh.Now I've just seen it again on DVD after thirty years have passed and this time I can see this time that it is a concise gem of storytelling.Uproariously funny in parts and very touching without descending to handkerchief sentimentality. Both Ryan O'Neil's character and Tatum's are so stoic and controlled that it really does put you back into the Bible country of the Depression. It works!! It is a quintessentially American movie, is not in the least profound, but is a bucket of fun and moves fast like a classic. Time has enriched it, just as time has enriched Casablanca and most classics.Madeliene Kahn, the one who the theater audiences loved the best and laughed at the loudest, is long gone. Ryan O'Neil is no longer a chiseled charmer, and Tatum is now a woman who is no longer even in the business. A nostalgic black and white tribute to earlier films that today is also nostalgia for the seventies rediscovery of the thirties. Hooray!!",

            "content": "After directing two modern film classics (and huge box office hits) with the gritty drama THE LAST PICTURE SHOW (1971) and the side-splitting screwball comedy WHAT'S UP, DOC? (1972), the pressure was on for whiz-kid director Peter Bogdanovich to continue his hot streak with critics and audiences. Fortunately, Bogdanovich was up the challenge, and crafted this effortlessly enjoyable Depression-era comedy-drama that meshes together many of the best aspects of his two previous films. Based on Joe David Brown's 1971 novel \"Addie Pray,\" the deceptively simple PAPER MOON takes a story of well-worn themes and makes it all feel fresh and new once again thanks to the professionalism of all involved and Bogdanovich's off-kilter approach. In many way, the film successfully combines the rapid-fire dialogue and breezy tone of WHAT'S UP, DOC with the downtrodden weariness of THE LAST PICTURE SHOW .This may sound like an unworkable and disorienting mixture, but PAPER MOON is a rare film that actually benefits from being composed of such opposing extremes. PAPER MOON does not share the same agenda as THE LAST PICTURE SHOW , however, which exposed the hypocrisies that were hidden in the era of pretend idealism that ran rampant in the fifties. PAPER MOON also differs from WHAT'S UP, DOC in the sense that WHAT'S UP, DOC took screwball comedies (a popular sub-genre of the late-thirties and early forties) and updated the format for audiences of the early-seventies - it was not a parody or a spoof, but simply the re-invention of a comedic art form. PAPER MOON does not expose the dark underpinnings of the thirties the way that THE LAST PICTURE SHOW did for the fifties, and it also does not re-invent the thirties road/buddy movies for the seventies that way that WHAT'S UP, DOC for thirties' screwball comedies; PAPER MOON simply and honestly is a movie of the thirties (right down to being filmed in grainy black-and-white, which gives viewers the feel of the depression like color photography never could) that just happens to have been created by filmmakers of the seventies.In the pivotal role of Addie, Bogdanovich chose WHAT'S UP, DOC star Ryan O'Neal's gravely-voiced nine-year-old daughter, Tatum, and the gamble proved to be as masterstroke. Displaying virtually none of the self-conscious blankness that plagues most child actors, Tatum emotes with a remarkable confidence and charisma and creates a very believable performance that won the young performer the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for 1973 (Tatum is still the youngest person to win an Oscar in a competitive category). The rest of the principal cast is composed of actors who also appeared in WHAT'S UP, DOC, including star Ryan O'Neal, whose Cary Grant-esquire handsomeness serves him well in the period setting. Madeline Kahn (who was also Oscar nominated) delivers one of her trademark performances that flawlessly mesh humor with sadness, and John Hillerman (impressive in a dual role) and P. J. Johnson (delightfully cynical as Kahn's long-suffering assistant) nearly steal the film in plum supporting roles. With superb art and set decoration, gorgeous black-and-white cinematography, a top drawer cast, and a sharply witty screenplay that keeps sentiment nicely restrained, PAPER MOON is a film that never misses it's intended mark.",

            "content": "I think what gets me most about this movie is that they never planned the ending! They got all the way to the end of the film, they were in Kansas/Missouri, and they had no ending in mind. Bogdanovich came up with the final scene between Addie and Moze when his wife looked at the long chalk road, and he realized Moze's $200 debt to Addie was a joke that hadn't quite been paid off. Absolute brilliance - the kind of thing entirely absent from film-making today.It's hard to call this heartwarming or heartbreaking - it definitely strikes a chord, but I was never close to tears of happiness or sadness. Nevertheless, this was an absolutely gorgeously conceived piece, beautifully filmed, and superbly acted. The entire ensemble turns in one of the best cast performances I have ever watched. From the opening shot of Addie to the long road at the end, without the benefit of a single digital effect, this movie is a stunner.Rarely these days do I find myself totally absorbed in the reality of a film. But even though I maintained a healthy awareness of some of the production aspects of this movie (i.e., the unbroken shot of the cars making u-turns at high speeds, Tatum nearly falling off the crates of whiskey, the elaborate construction of a period look in the in-town scenes), I genuinely dove into this. I recommend this to anyone who appreciates film, and to anyone who doesn't, this might make you.",

It is probably the best film that I have seen in about a year's time.First of all, I have never seen a child actor give such an outstanding performance before. She acted so adult and was great throughout the picture. Her relationship with Moze is really neat throughout as well. It was cool to see a relationship like that played out in a movie. The story was very neat as well. I tend to like movies that show me people acting in a way, or doing something that is not possible for me to ever be able to do. Of course, I am not going to be a con man and live as recklessly as they did in this movie, so that made for a very enjoyable story for me. Everything that went on in this film really made me want to see more. It was very enjoyable and had some amazing dynamic between a small girl and an adult criminal. I highly recommend this film.",

Addie's puerile behavior adds to the sweetness of the movie.Addie is bereaved by her estranged mother's death and thus becomes an orphan. Moses is not quite sure if he is the father of the child but is forced to drop the child at her aunt's house. Addie is as obdurate as any child of her age, a habitual smoker and is good observer of any situation. She helps Moses earn money from selling bibles by pretending to be his lovely daughter, who convinces people the exorbitant price of the bible was due to its quality and names inscribed on it. They share an usual bond until Moses finds a lousy woman. She concocts a plan to oust her and succeeds.Moses and Addie are on the run when a liquor deal goes awry. They are captured but flee the police station when Addie executes an unimaginable escape plan. Moses is finally captured in the neighboring state and all the money he raised is taken by the depraved cops.

Both are set in Black and White... slyly giving the films a warm and inviting tone that often \"real\" old movies have. \"Paper Moon\" is fun and involving, it is obvious that alot of detail was worked on to bring this movie its charm.Now about Tantum O'Neal, she not only steals the entire movie, she got an oscar for doing so.. as questionable as it might sound to give a supporting Oscar to a \"Lead\" role... the Academy obviously knew she had no chance at winning a deserved award only being a child. Shes not only famous for being the youngest Oscar Winner, but as started the trend for \"Supporting Actresses\" Career's to fade fast once winning their award. Tantum has clearly never been as good in any film, probably because everyone expected her to be just as great, since her leap from Child Star into Adult Star. It was reported that the director reshot her scenes for this movie repeativly for this movie untill he got just the right reactions from Tantum. If anyone got an award for anything else its her for working so hard... and think about how hard it has to be for a child's attention span. Tantum O'Neal sparkles through every scene, even if sometimes you can tell which were reshot (near the beginning).\"Paper Moon\" is very funny, powered by the casting of the two O'Neals both being related. M. Kahn is funny too in a somewhat slight role. \"Paper Moon\" is going to be a classic if it isn't already (keep in mind its only from the 70's). It's Brilliantly made to make you feel the \"love\" without it actually being said. Great through-out, never a low point, Entertainment at its highest!",

The movie was shown on 35mm in a small art-house and Peter B. greeted the crowd and answered a few questions as well. What amazed myself was how humble he was, certainly not your common Producer and or Director trait these days. He told us about the Locations in Kansas and the miserable whether, hot-cold and rain. When Tatum's first scene came up, she did not correctly speak the dialog from the Script. Then he was told; \"She can't read! He decided then and there with all her scenes, she could just improvise whatever dialog she felt best saying! That is what makes this film, the dialog match the characters in time period in Amercian History that is hard today to even imagine. The boldness of Peter B. to just go with the flow per say and let Ryan and Tatum work off each other comes off as some of the best acting ever on screen. This film never leaves my mind when I see other Movies of that time period such as The Last Picture Show and Ironweed. My real favorite is \"Hard Times\". But Paper Moon gets to the point of everything it touches, a wonderful example of true American Cinema when Stories mattered! The cast speaks for themselves, the cinematography... a lesson in shooting B&W in modern day times and general Production Design of this film is the Best you can get.

I was in college and it brought back similar times. It did that again today. If you've never seen the movie, do so, it will make you feel good. I guarantee you will laugh. With a great cast and good plot how can you miss? Peter Bogdanovich proved himself a winner in black and white, with movies like Paper Moon and The Last Picture Show (now a trip into simpler times, but full of nostalgia for baby boomers) it's a wonder he does not get more credit. Same for Ryan O'Neil and Tatum. What a great team they made in this movie. What girl would not want to ride around the country with a handsome man she \"prays\" is her father selling bibles, passing twenties and trying to help others as they \"help themselves\". Also, watching Madeline Kahn was a delight. Fortunately we have this fun movie to watch her in. The movie some how manages to draw us in and hold our interest without any special effects, violence, gratuitous sex, or color. Next time you want to feel good or do something with your kids or grandkids - watch this movie.",

This movie, along with \"What's Up Doc?\" (also featuring Ryan O'Neil & Madeline Kahn, & also directed by Bogdanovich) were my absolute favorite movies when I was a kid. In the years since, I've learned to loathe Ryan O'Neil, but he was in fine form in this movie. His daughter Tatum steals the show, though. It was just so, I dunno, liberating? shocking? I can't say, but it had a huge effect one me, this little girl who swore and smoked and ran cons with this man who may or may not have been her father. This was also one of the earliest appearances on film of Madeline Kahn, and like in so many other movies, her character just steals every scene she's in. It's a lot of fun contrasting the stuffy, repressed neurotic Eunice she played in \"What's Up Doc?\" the previous year to her character Trixie Delight in this movie, who is, well, anything but repressed.",

            "content": "The crew of this film put extraordinary effort into researching period detail, and it shows. But beyond the costumes, excellent choice of music, and careful set decoration, it's perhaps the locations themselves that really make the film. The interiors were all actual places, not Hollywood sets, giving the feeling that you just stepped into 1930s rural America. And the flat, desolate Kansas landscape really conveys a sense of loneliness and despair that must have been a reality for many living through the Depression. In addition, the movie has all the basics required for a classic: a good, timeless story; interesting characters that are well-cast; and fine actors. Amazingly, many of the small character parts were first-time actors. It's a tribute to the director that he saw something in them and could coax out such natural performances.I noticed in the ratings some people who gave this a 1 or 2. If that's what they think of a movie as good as this, then I just can't imagine what they would like.Paper Moon is a stunning achievement. It's as good now, if not better, than the day it was made. Highly recommend for virtually all ages.",

            "content": "Ah selling bibles to the widows of the recently deceased. That is the \"job\" of Moses Pray, played by Ryan O'Neal, and it's an \"Oh man, oh god, oh man, oh god\" free performance. ;) The film also stars Tatum O'Neal (his real life daughter, if you hadn't guessed already) and the great late Madeline Kahn.The film begins at a little girls' mum's funeral, Addie Loggins (played naturally by T. O'Neal). In comes Moses Pray, distractingly I might add. He claims to be a friend of Addie's mother, although the two women comment on how much he looks like Addie. He denies all accusations, but obliges to the request of the two women and takes Addie with him. Her destination is her Aunt Billie's in St. Joseph Missouri. Along the way, he swindles a shop owner out of 200 dollars (the shop owner is the brother of the man who killed Addie's mother) by claiming that he is her father. Moses is all set to send Addie off on a train, when she confronts him about the 200 dollars (he used the majority of it on fixing up his car). She claims it to be her own (which it is) and orders him to give her the money, even threatening to tell the police on him. This forces Moses to take Addie with him. They as a team scam widows out of money for a bible, supposedly ordered by their then alive husbands. Traveling together, they learn about each other, and form a friendship.The father-daughter relationship between the O'Neals is truly special and both of them churn in great performances, Tatum more-so. Tatum displays a lot of acting maturity, there were times when I forgot she was just a child. She won a supporting actress Oscar for her truly special performance. But I have to wonder, why she was put in such a category. She's so clearly lead and I don't know how anyone could think otherwise. You take her character out of the movie and you basically have nothing. Anyways, I don't want to debate her placement any further than what I did. She's lead in my mind, if you think otherwise, it's not going to make it any tougher for me to sleep at night. I'm rambling, let's continue along with the review. The person I was most impressed with (and not surprised in the least) was Madeline Kahn. She was a master comedian, and her speech on the hill is one of my favourite monologues in film ever. She's flawless in the role, and her character is almost tragic. My favourite line of hers is \"Let ol' Trixie sit up front with her big tits.\" Absolutely mesmerizing in every way possible.I would recommend this, just for Miss Kahn's performance.8.0/10",

            "content": "\"Paper Moon\" is one of three important films from director Bogdanovich (\"Last Picture Show\" and \"What's Up, Doc\" are the other two). These films, in particular \"Paper Moon\", were the reason I fell in love with movies. In 1973, the Hollywood idea of film-making was three years into changing - a case of art imitating life. These changes brought about expressive films filled with sex and violence as Hollywood explored the under-belly of real life. In the middle of this new \"shocking\" cinema comes a filmmaker such as Bogdanovich who masterfully delivers simplicity by capturing the essence and romance of life long gone.\"Paper Moon\" is an absorbing, depression-era tale of a father/daughter con team, traveling throughout Kansas and Missouri, collecting \"money due\" on \"pre-ordered\" Bibles. Along the way, they meet up with trouble and quite a collection of fascinating characters. The black and white photography compliments the era; the actors compliment the rich dialog; this is story-telling without the need for weepy sentimentality or heavy dramatics. Overall, a deeply focused, extremely entertaining comedy/drama that has never diminished from age or repeated viewings.Stars Ryan and Tatum O'Neal are perfect - it is obvious why Tatum won the Oscar for this performance and it is obvious that father Ryan really can act! The late, always great Madeline Kahn is absolutely a gem in a small, yet important role.I just caught a screening of \"Paper Moon\" on Turner Classic Movies (Thank God for TCM) and this has now inspired me to make the DVD commitment to a film that will forever be one of the true great American classics!",
