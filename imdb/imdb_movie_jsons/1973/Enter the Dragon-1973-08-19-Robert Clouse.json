Then again in the early 2k on a dvd which I own.Revisited it recently with my family.This time Lee plays a martial arts instructor who is approached by the British Intelligence and is persuaded to attend a martial arts tournament on a private island owned by Han, a crime lord.Lee's assignment is to gather evidence that will prove Han's involvement in drug trafficking and prostitution.The movie has amazing star cast, few top notch martial arts fight scenes n wonderful music score.This one is not as intense as Fist of Fury but very entertaining.The villain Han is not intimidating or a convincing fighter yet he is able to take down the character of Jim Kelly.We have Sammo Hung in an uncredited role in the opening fight scene against Lee at the start of the film.Enter the Dragon along with Game of Death were the foundation for fighting games. Both these movies inspired various martial arts n action movies.We also have Bolo Yeung before he became the usual villain in JCVD's movies.In Fist of Fury, Lee's character bites the leg of a Russian fighter during a duel.In this movie John Saxon's character bites the leg of Bolo Yeung during a duel.",

            "content": "In the years since his bizarre and tragic death, martial arts legend and master Bruce Lee has become a sort of icon within the Kung-fu movie circuit.The last film that he completed before his death, 1973's \"Enter the Dragon,\" has become not only a masterful showcase for Lee's talents (both fighting and acting), but in the 31 years since its release has become perhaps the definitive martial arts movie of all time.Lee, in his first and last English-speaking performance, stars as a martial arts expert who is recruited by the British government to infiltrate an island fortress, under the cover of being invited to a martial arts tournament, to investigate a possible slavery/drug ring led by a former nemesis of his. Indeed something is amiss at this isolated island fortress, as he discovers that his nemesis Han (Shih Kien) is the host of the tournament and is also the leader of the same gang that murdered his sister. Soon enough, Lee, together with two other martial artists, Roper (John Saxon) and Williams (Jim Kelly), go to work kicking a** everywhere until the final showdown with the murderous, one-handed villain Han in the classic \"Hall of Mirrors\" fight sequence.\"Enter the Dragon,\" a joint American-Chinese production, was intended to be Bruce Lee's introduction to Western audiences, but due to his tragic death just weeks before the film's American release, we will never know what he would have been capable of here in the states. Even more tragically, his son Brandon Lee would experience a similar fate just like his father only 20 years later with \"The Crow.\"There are so many classic fight scenes, which I can watch over and over without them ever becoming boring. Many of them still hold up very well, especially by 2004's standards, where fight scenes are mostly digitally enhanced or involve \"wire\" or \"Matrix-fu\" to make up for lack of actual stunt work; plus one has to remember that this film was made in 1973, in the days before wirework would become dominant in today's martial arts cinema. The \"Cavern Fight\" is probably my favorite fight sequence of all time, in any martial arts movie. Many of the fights in this movie, more specially the ones where Lee is involved, have a surreal feeling to them. He brings a kind of grace to his action scenes that have yet to be topped by any actor alive today. Lee even brings many of his own personal philosophies to this film, which makes much sense and perhaps help to understand some of the more philosophical elements to the story. But more than anything, this was Bruce Lee's entr\u00e9e to Americans; many people, including myself, were introduced to martial arts cinema through \"Enter the Dragon.\"There are also several cameos made by future martial arts stars that would eventually reach stardom, most notably Jackie Chan (as a henchman during the \"Cavern Fight\" sequence who has his neck broken by Lee) and Sammo Hung (as Lee's sparring partner in the opening fight sequence).I could go on and on about what makes this movie immortal, but I feel I should let you see what makes it great. Bruce Lee was forever immortalized with this film and it will be cherished and praised forever.",

            "content": "'Enter The Dragon' was a massive part of my childhood back in the 1970s. As a pre-teen Bruce Lee was just about the coolest thing I'd ever seen. Maybe only Bond (Sean Connery Bond!) and Charlton Heston as 'The Omega Man' came close. Like 'The Omega Man' this movie is one that I find difficult to be objective about. The plot is simplistic, the acting is variable, but the action and the LOOK of it make it an all time classic. Let's face it this is a kung fu movie, and what the audience wants is exciting fight scenes. 'Enter The Dragon' has them and then some! I'm not sure whether I'd describe it as \"the greatest martial arts movie ever made\" (as many people do), but it's certainly one of the most entertaining I've ever seen. The only other one I've seen that comes close is 'Iron Monkey', but as good as it was, it obviously didn't have the one thing that makes this movie legendary - Bruce Lee. Lee is without a doubt the greatest ku fu fighter to step in front of a movie camera. Handsome and charismatic, this movie was to be his introduction to mainstream Hollywood audiences. He died unexpectedly just weeks before it premiered in America. It seems certain that he would have become a superstar, bigger than Jackie Chan (who incidentally has a brief cameo here) is today. Whenever Lee is on the screen you can't take your eyes off him - he's that good. You don't need any other reason to watch this movie than Bruce Lee, but having John Saxon ('Planet Of Blood', 'Tenebrae') co-star is an added treat, and Jim Kelly is super cool. After the enormous success of 'Enter The Dragon' director Robert Clouse made 'Black Belt Jones' with him, another 70s kung fu classic, but Kelly never really fulfilled his potential, and instead made cheesy but fun b-grade vehicles like 'Black Samurai' and 'Black Belt Jones 2'. I also love Han, the tongue-in-cheek 'Dr No' inspired villain played by Kien Shih. 'Enter The Dragon' is essential viewing for all 1970s buffs. It had a major impact on pop culture and it's still great wonderful to watch thirty years after it was originally released. To say I highly recommend this movie is an understatement!",

            "review_title": "Very stylish and intense martial arts action film",
            "content": "As a child, one of my first and best friends was a strange boy who worshiped the ground Bruce Lee walked on - cutting his hair, taking Jiu Jitsu and Hapkido lessons, and often stalking around with that intense animal fury that only Lee could create all over his 7 year old face. My friend took a lot of abuse for this and other odd behaviors with dignity that his hero would have applauded. Unfortunately, Mr. Lee passed from this world very young, leaving a legend and a pair of shoes that have never really been filled. For most Americans, this is the only Hollywood film worthy of mention with his name in the cast. Don't get me wrong, I love Jackie Chan and Jet Li and even the few Chow Yun Fat roles involving martial arts, but each of these actors have their own, very big, personalities, and - at least in the case of Chan - have built their own unique legend. Unlike his successors, what Lee excelled at was the intense physicality and drama of his performance. He worked every muscle of his body in every beautifully choreographed fight scene of Enter The Dragon, and made art out of violence in ways that today's Hollywood gun violence schlock-directors can only dream of. And Enter the Dragon is one of his most stunning vehicles.The pseudo-Taoisms are kept to a minimum and concentrated near the beginning of this film. Lee enters a martial arts tournament to avenge the murder of his sister, and to defend the honor of the Shao Lin Temple, where he helps to train young martial artists. John Saxon, a down-on-his luck playboy and brigand is the closest thing to a co-star, and comes to the tournament hoping for a solution to his financial problems. The tournament is hosted by a mass-murdering heroin manufacturer who hides his production facilities, literally, beneath a martial arts school, using the instructors and students in the school as an army of body guards. Kien Shih is absolutely compelling as the evil Han, even if his fight scenes are, at times, a bit less convincing than the master Lee's. Lee and Shih are the performance highlights of the film. Though Saxon does a passable job, his performance is a bit fibrous at times.Worth seeing for the sets and settings alone, this film is driven well by its fast pace, simple but engaging story line, and the sheer talent of Bruce Lee. Of course, there are the usual problems of the martial arts genre - villains whose sense of honor for the most part only applies to life-threatening situations fighting would-be heroes, the lack of any weapons besides fists and unused knives, unnecessary nude scenes - it is very easy to overlook these problems and just enjoy the film.Highly recommended.",

            "content": "When it comes to kung fu, Bruce Lee is a legend. When it comes to kung fu cinema, Enter the Dragon is the most highly regarded. In other words, you owe it to yourself to see this flick! The story is relatively simple but quite sufficient and sprinkled with humor. The locations and setting are wonderful as well. The characters are one of the main attractions here though, with the gambling but honorable Roper (John Saxon), the feisty and unorthodox (but effective!) Williams (Jim Kelly), Chinese Hercules Bolo, and the great baddie Han, the hand man. Bruce Lee's presence, of course, steals the show. While some of the fight scenes from Lee's Chinese Connection (I think that's the one) may rival the ones here, ETD is a far more well-rounded film. The variety of exciting fights are skillfully choreographed and there's not too much downtime from the action either; even in the flash back we have some excellent female butt-kicking. And you gotta love that 70's soundtrack! This is a classic action film that will never be forgotten. The two-disc DVD was loaded with goodies; you really couldn't ask for more, except for maybe a better commentary. Producer Paul Heller was dull, dry, and had little to offer.",

            "review_title": "Still a classic three decades later",
            "content": "Long held to be the grand-daddy of all martial arts films, Enter the Dragon was recently re- released on DVD with the full treatment \u0096 digital restoration, a few short scenes added back in, and interviews with all of the surviving cast, plus some extras about the film and a few interviews with Bruce Lee. Most of you have probably already seen it, as it's thirty years old, but even though the film is almost absurdly steeped in the 70s, it still holds up remarkably well. Aside from dangerously wide lapels and some corny era-related dialogue (most notably delivered by Jim Kelly, the film's only African American). Enter the Dragon still delivers the same powerful punch it did three decades ago.Of course, back then, it was merely the best martial arts film. Now, however, it is the chief testament to the grace and skill of Bruce Lee, and the only one of his four films that he had any sort of creative control over \u0096 and you can see the difference between this and his Hong Kong films easily.Lee does a Tony Danza and plays Mr. Lee, a shao-lin warrior who is recruited by a foreign government (it's assumed to be the English but is never explicitly stated) to infiltrate the island of a megalomaniac martial artist named Han (Kien Shih) who holds tournaments to find the best martial artists in the world. And because that's not enough motivation, it's also revealed that Han's bodyguard, Oharra (Robert Wall) killed Bruce's sister three years ago. So, like every Lee movie, there is a personal vendetta involved, and like every Lee film, Bruce's character asks forgiveness from his family for the deadly violence he is about to unleash. Along for the ride are gamblaholic Roper (John Saxon) and ghetto survivor Williams (Kelly).The plot seems like a contrivance now, but that was before it was copied to death in the last three decades. It's actually a plausible and somewhat clever excuse to show people what they came to see \u0096 Bruce Lee repeatedly kicking butt. From the opening fight scene (against Sammo Hung) through the fabulous finale where Lee single-handedly takes on half the island, the movie is a joy to watch on the physical level. It's the world's greatest martial artist at his peak, in a showcase perfectly designed for him. It was an ideal if unintentional shrine to the man.Lee is not merely content to let us watch him bash people, though; some of his philosophy penetrates the movie, which is probably the real reason why Enter the Dragon has stayed so fresh so long. Lee talks about spirituality with a young charge and even gives us an amusing and illustrative lesson in his 'art of fighting without fighting' \u0096 which is the credo of any real warrior. Lee also shows us the flip side; the show-offs and power-hungry who are only in it for the physical and material advantage. He takes care to show us how debased they are before dispatching them, however.While Saxon and the rest of the cast are perfectly acceptable (Jim Kelly overdoes it a bit, but oddly that fits the film), Lee is terrific in this piece. Bruce Lee was a riveting performer and nowhere is that better demonstrated than in this movie. It's a testament to his legacy that three decades later, no one has come close to his skill, and people are still stealing ideas from him (Kill Bill, etc.). It gives one pause while watching Enter the Dragon to think of just what Bruce Lee could have accomplished had he lived.I suppose those who don't like martial arts wouldn't care for this film, but I've seen it convert even unbelievers before. Lee is that good, and that charismatic, that you can't help but be drawn to him. Certainly his greatest film is worth checking out again on this spiffy new re- release. Even if you're not the biggest martial arts fan, how often do you get to check out a legend at the top of his game?",

            "content": "Enter the Dragon (1973) was Bruce Lee's first (and only) solo big Hollywood production. Too bad he never got to see the fruits of his labor. He passed away during the film's post production (don't fret, two more official Bruce Lee films were made after this one. Despite all of the years of hard work and finally making it to the big times, he wasn't around long enough to enjoy it. Even though Robert Clouse is credited as director and another person is credited for writing the screenplay. This film has Bruce Lee's fingerprints all over it.The movie is about a shady underworld crime lord (aren't they always) who controls most of the world's opium drug ring and a lot of other illegal dealings. British Intelligence is stumped, so they seek out someone who's slick, sly, stealth and who can kick a lot of butt and take care of himself. They find their man (Bruce Lee). After a great deal of convincing they get him to go to the island and participate in the crime lord's fighting tournament. Along the way, Bruce meets two American fighters (John Saxon and Jim Kelly) who are in the tournament for various reasons. Whilst on the island, Bruce does his nightly snooping around so he can find out more about the crime lord and his illegal activities. Will Bruce topple the organization? Can he make it out alive? Does Bruce really kick a whole lot of butt and take names? To find out you'll have to watch Enter The Dragon!!!!Bruce Lee worked a great deal on this picture. He wrote most of the screenplay (uncredited), filmed all of the action scenes (uncredited) and directed several scenes (uncredited). Lam Ching-Ying, Angela Mao, Jackie Chan and Bolo Yeung appear in this film. If you haven't seen this film already then you're either a kid, lame or something is wrong with you. Highly recommended.",

            "content": "This martial arts classic sees Lee, a highly skilled fighter, asked by British Intelligence to investigate Han, a suspected crime boss who was trained in martial arts at the same Shaolin temple as Lee. Han has set up a base on a remote private island but once every three years he holds a martial arts competition which attracts the best from around the world. Apart from Lee the most notable other contestants are Americans Roper, who has gambling debts, and Williams, a karate expert who served with Roper in Vietnam. Once there Lee starts to investigate and it isn't long before it becomes apparent just how dangerous Han is.In many ways this can be thought of as a martial arts James Bond film with Lee replacing Bond... the villain could certainly have come from a Bond film; not only does he live on a secretive private island but he spends several scenes stoking a white cat! The story is relatively simple but serves to deliver some great martial arts scenes. These fights are brilliantly choreographed but unlike many such films to fights still feel brutally real. They also feature a good array of weapons as well as many unarmed fights Bruce Lee is great as our protagonist; no martial arts actor is as intense as he was. The support is solid; John Saxon impresses as Roper and Jim Kelly brings a coolness to the role of Williams. These characters are given some decent motivations so are more than just characters who can fight well. Overall I'd recommend this film; it is a must see for fans of the genre.",

Its merit lies purely in the action content.  If you were to ask any learned martial artist I'm sure that 9 out of 10 would tell you that the fight sequences are unparalleled, even today.  The fluidity of Lee is astounding.  Unlike most martial arts films of that time the fighting is very realistic, and has a somewhat visceral quality.  There is also the use of traditional Oriental weapons (nunchaku, escrima sticks, etc..), although the British censors in their wisdom have seen fit the cut the nunchaku sequence, and I'm afraid, like any censored movie, it just isn't the same watching when you know you aren't getting the full monty, so to speak.Still, on the whole one of my personal favourites and a must see for any action or seventies film fan.

            "content": "Directed by Robert Clouse, Enter the Dragon is a fun movie to watch, but gees it hasn't aged well. It's speak 1970's with its film clich\u00e9s that mimics other big hits of that bygone era like 1971's Shaft and 1971's James Bond's Diamonds are Forever. You can see it with cheesy one-liners lines, gimmick villains, and funky soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin. The \"70's man dude\" swagger will make you roll your eyes more than once. It's a priceless little period details that remind us fondly of a bygone time that was 1970's Hong Kong cinema. The movie is pretty much like a James Bond movie, but with Bruce Lee. Bruce Lee was great at martial arts, but he was also a OK actor. I think his noises are the best bit, and his god like build. Still, those facial expression and sound effects from him can be a bit cartoony. Bruce Lee hits his opponent with that double stomp move, he looked constipated. At the time, it was really rare to see an Asian in the main role. The Hollywood producers and directors like to make the White guy the hero of the films because most Americans don't like seeing other minorities have a lead role in a Hollywood film. It wasn't until Bruce Lee two other previous films became such a hit, that Warner Bros took a risk with this movie. This film was the first Chinese martial arts film to have been produced by a major Hollywood studio. The movie starts with Bruce Lee as a Shaolin martial artist name Lee. He receives an invitation to a martial arts tournament on an island by the mysterious Mr. Han (Shih Kien) who own a fighting school there. The British secret service wanted Bruce Lee to go undercover to see if he is doing drug trafficking and prostitution there. Joining Bruce Lee are two competitors from America including white gambler Roper (John Saxon), and Williams (Jim Kelly), an African-American activist. Soon all three must fight to get off the island. Bruce Lee had an incredible sense of aesthetics in all his fight scenes. No wonder he had so many followers and disciples. His fight with O'Hara (Bob Wall) is intense. Boards don't hit back but Bruce Lee unfortunately does. A lot of people don't understand what Bruce Lee did when he first hit O'Hara. He used a Ving Tsun (Wing Chun) principle of 3 things done at one time. They say Bruce had to slow down his speed considerably for this so he doesn't seriously hit Karate champion Bob Wall. It's still faster then the speed of light, but not only did Robert Wall say that getting kicked by Bruce Lee was like getting hit by a truck, but the guy who caught him as he flew back into the crowd broke both of his arms just by Wall's body flying backwards with that much force. Interesting fact: Hong Kong Kung Fu expert and Jackie Chan fellow stuntman Yuen Biao was the stunt double that did the back flip when O'Hara grabs the feet. Bruce Lee did not know any acrobatic movements. Yuen Biao was also a stunt double of Bruce Lee in many of the fight scenes at the end. The battle with the guards was Magnificent! His skill is extraordinary. Nice to see a cameo by fellow Martial Artist Jackie Chan as a henchman. Still, it would be nice to see Lee fought Bolo. Bolo Yeung versus Bruce Lee and then add more sinister champions to make Enter the Dragon a little more highly enjoyable film. Bruce Lee fight with Sammo Hung in the beginning of the film looks like MMA fighting similar to UFC. Damn was Bruce that far ahead of his time. Still, he looks like he fighting in diapers against another guy in diapers. I do like the final fight against Han in the Hall of Mirrors. I like the fact that Han is missing a hand, which means he can conveniently slot into his wrist such like blades. Such a gimmicky villain. That kick to Han's head was intense. Just that shot, alone is worth watching. I would love to see if Enter the Dragon was made differently is to eliminate John Saxon and Jim Kelly out of the element, as they really can't fight and focus on Bruce Lee entirely. Pretty much at the same time, also retain the whole atmosphere and look of the movie with a real story, at least some of it, going on. I rather see a tournament, having Bruce Lee granted more matches than just one battle with O'Hara. I want to see more fighting then what we saw on film. What I liked about Bruce Lee in his films was he would walk away from a fight unless he was provoked some more. He used his skills for defense and it really would bug him if he wound up killing someone. Like you would fight him, he'd beat you and then walk away. But if you got back up and tried fighting him again then he'd make you pay. Still, the movie suffers in a few categories. The mediocre script, wooden acting, and an inept storyline. There was pretty bad flashback sequence most notable for its bad choreography. Depending which version you watch. Recent English-language versions of the film include scenes that were originally exclusive to the Cantonese and Mandarin dubs. The English audio for those scenes was either never recorded or lost, so different English actors did the dubbing for those scenes at a different time. Overall: It's worth watching, no matter what. Bruce Lee might be gone, but his spirit lives on through his movies for eternity.",

            "content": "\"Enter The Dragon\" of 1973 is not only essential for Bruce Lee fans, but a must-see for every lover of cult-cinema for a variety of reasons. While director Robert Clouse's stylish and violent Martial Arts extravaganza is not necessarily the greatest Bruce Lee flick, it is his most famous and most influential film, both due to the fact that it was his first American-produced film (and the first American-produced Martial Arts film ever), and, mainly, because it was the last film the Master appeared in before his untimely death. More precisely, \"Enter The Dragon\" had its world premiere only six days after the great Martial Arts icon had passed away on July 20th, 1973. The film's cult-status even excels its level of fame - the iconic picture of Bruce Lee with bleeding scratches on his chest must be one of the most widely known movie stills ever, and is immediately recognized even by people who have never seen the film and don't know its title. This film basically was the kick-off to the popularity of Martial Arts films in the Western World, but even apart from the fact how influential it was, this is a great film to watch. In its style, it somehow resembles funky and incomparably more violent Marial Arts version of the older James Bond films - sexy ladies and eccentric villains come along with stylish and ultra-violent unarmed battle on a beautiful remote island.Kung Fu expert Lee (Bruce Lee) is applied to attend a tournament on a remote island owned by the mysterious Han (Kien Shih). Besides engaging in fights, Lee is to infiltrate the villainous Han's evil crime syndicate. But love of justice is not Lee's sole motivation to come to the island, as one of Han's henchmen is responsible for his sister's death... Lee is not the only kung fu-expert participating in the tournament, of course. Several other great fighters have arrived, most memorably the crafty Roper (played by none other than the great John Saxon) and the super-cool Williams (played by Jim Kelly, basically THE black Martial Artist, who went on to make another film with director Clouse, \"Black Belt Jones\" the following year). And then there are more familiar faces for Martial Arts fans, such as the monstrously-looking Bolo Yeung and the scar-faced Robert Wall. Angela Mao, Ahna Capri, and a bunch of other foxy ladies provide most welcome female eye-candy in-between the fights. The martial arts sequences are stylish, violent, and, in one word, amazing. Bruce Lee himself did the choreography of the fights - I don't suppose I need to say any more. All that is accompanied by a funky soundtrack and the typical awesome 70s feeling that my fellow fans of cult-cinema love so much. This is an absolute must-see for Martial Arts- and Cult-cinema fans, and I also highly recommend it to anybody else. I know the following statement is nothing new or original, but it sure is to the point: Bruce Lee was THE MAN, and always will be, and not an entire army of Jet Lis and Jackie Chans can ever replace him!",

Enter the Dragon is the Citizen Kane and Bruce Lee is the Orson Welles of the martial arts film genre. This film marked the most successful merging of both Hong Kong and American cinema. From the opening scene to the final fight scene it was Bruce Lee at his best.  His near perfect physique, leading man good looks and innate charisma transcended the derivative script and gave it a timeless quality. Having read the original draft of Enter the Dragon originally titled \"Blood and Steel\", The final film is a far cry from it.  He turned major monologues into short but memorable phrases like \"It is like a finger pointing away to the moon\". Very few people then, and now could utter those words and be taken seriously. It was Bruce Lee not writer Michael Allin who gave the movie it's spiritual core and it was Bruce Lee not directed Robert Clouse who gave it its sense of cinematic style. Proof of this lies in the fact that both Allin and Clouse were never able to reproduce the quality or success of Enter the Dragon before or after Bruce Lee. Bruce borrowed heavily from Clint Eastwood's persona and gave it his own unique twist. After all these years, Enter the Dragon stands alone in the genre and stands as one of Hollywood's most profitable feature films.",

            "content": "Enter the Dragon starts as a Shalolin martial arts expert named Lee (co-producer Bruce Lee) is contacted by American secret service agent guy Braithwaite (Geoffrey Weeks) who wants him to go undercover at a martial arts tournament held by international crime-lord Han (Kien Shih), Lee also learns that his younger sister committed suicide after being attacked by Han's bodyguard Oharra (Robert Wall). Lee decides he can not only help rid the world of a vicious crime-lord but avenge the death of his sister, a sort of 'kill two birds with one stone' situation which he can't refuse. Lee travels to Hong Kong & then onto Han's private island where the tournament is held & he runs his criminal empire with the intention of bringing him down...This Chinese American co-production was directed by Robert Clouse & is generally regarded as a classic, personally I don't think it's deserving of such an accolade but it ain't a bad film. The script by Michael Allin felt like a James Bond flick to me, a secret undercover guy sent in to stop some crime lord who owns his own private island with a secret underground base, he has interchangeable metal hands just like Joseph Wiseman in Dr. No (1963) & he also carries around & strokes a fluffy white cat just like Blofeld in the Bond films! The main bad guy also has a few henchmen including one with a distinctive scar. I suppose the main difference is that Enter the Dragon is far more violent than any Bond film with Bruce Lee's martial arts skills defeating all on comers. In fact it gets pretty boring in the sense that Lee literally kicks & punches everyone out with one hit & no-one can even hit him once. It becomes a precession where you know Lee is going to knock everyone out, the only interest is how he does it either with a punch, a kick or a pair of nun-chucks. I don't really like martial arts films that much & if I want a spy thriller I'll watch a James Bond film & to me Enter the Dragon is some strange mixture of the two which provides decent entertainment & is quite fun but ultimately didn't do much for me. Also how did anyone know that Lee's sister had committed suicide? The only other person in the room was Han's bodyguard Oharra & since Lee's sister killed herself how did anyone else find out? The guy who told Lee was knocked out earlier on by Oharra, answers on a postcard please...Director Clouse does alright but it's Bruce Lee who is credited with the fight direction & choreography, the fights look good & are pretty violent & if your a fan of Lee then you will love this. The climax set in a room of mirrors, according to the IMDb over 8,000 mirrors were used, is quite a disorientating & imaginative sequence. Enter the Dragon was one of only two American films Bruce Lee appeared in which used his real voice, sadly Lee died in Hong Kong three weeks before the films premiere. The film was shot without sound & all dialogue & sound effects were added in post production, it's very noticeable as well. For all you foot fetishists there is a trampling scene of a barefoot woman standing & walking on a mans back.With a supposed budget of about $850,000 this didn't have a huge budget by any stretch of the imagination, it's reasonably well made although the fact it's dubbed throughout is painfully obvious. The acting is OK but I find it hard to take actor John Saxon as a martial arts expert seriously.Enter the Dragon is an OK film, it passes 100 odd minutes painlessly enough. I didn't think it was as good as it's lofty reputation suggested but I liked it all the same. I guess I'm just not a fan of very one sided martial arts fights, there's just not enough vulnerability for Lee's character. Good but not brilliant.",

Him investigating Han's illegal operation bring a little suspense to the story and reminds us of a good old detective movie. The acting was good for the most part as Kien Shih makes a great villain and John Saxon and Jim Kelly make a good supporting duo. The flashback scenes in Saxon and Kelly's background drag the movie somewhat, but the excitement begins when they reach Han's island.

            "content": "Yes, \"Enter the Dragon\" is a typically badly made material arts movie, with a simple almost non-existent story, cheesy dialog, laughable bad dubbing, over-the-top fight sequences and extremely stereotypical characters. You know it't the type of movie in which one of the villains has an huge scar on his face and the other had a prosthetic hand. Yet \"Enter the Dragon\" is a totally brilliant movie, which is because of more than one reason. Everything works out so well and blends in perfectly with each other. It's delicious pulp!Material arts movies just never have been the most subtle, greatly written, or most original movies around. Just think about those Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris type of movies. I mean basically every movie is always the same. This movie is not much different were it not that this was one of the first real international material arts genre movie and therefor the movie is also genre redefining. It set the standards for the material arts movie genre and its story has been used in many different form and shape ever since. These days its mostly used in comical movies actually.Guess this movie can be best described as material arts meeting James Bond. The story and characters definitely show similarities to the James Bond genre but that does not mean that this movie is just a simple rip-off. It has enough class and style of its own and I wouldn't had mind seeing this turn into a long running series of movies, starring Bruce Lee. That was impossible of course unfortunately.The story is incredibly simple and it's actually also a hard one to believe. I mean really, why would a martial artist ever agree on becoming a spy and infiltrate a criminal organization under the cover of a tournament. However as the movie progresses you just stop caring really about the story and what the movie is all about. You just take it for what it is; good quality entertainment with Bruce Lee in top form! It's such a waste he died at such an early age, even weeks before the Hong Kong premiere of this movie. He had the looks, the skills but also certainly the right acting abilities for these type of movies to become an huge international action hero movie star.All of the other actors aren't much special. It's not hard to see why none of them ever had a sparkling acting career, however it's also due to the simple dialog and bad, at times laughable, dubbing that their performance don't quite come across as anything strong or impressive, although Kien Shih does a good job playing the main villain, that's deliciously simple and evil! As a matter of fact, it also seems that the movie could had been without halve of its characters. I mean exactly what do Roper and Williams add? And what was the point of having Mei Ling in the movie?The fight sequences are really brilliantly choreographed by Bruce Lee himself. Every fight on its self forms a highlight of the movie, with of course the well known end fight in the mirror-room as the ultimate highlight.Simply the best of the best, that the genre has to offer!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "review_title": "Lightweight but stylish, this is a truly iconic movie",
            "content": "This cult classic adventure plays like James Bond with martial arts - which is exactly what it is, and rather blatantly so. The film concerns a young secret agent who has to secretly infiltrate a cruel dictator's island retreat and discover his terrible secrets. As if that wasn't enough, there are underground factories and a white cat which the chief villain strokes. Convinced yet? Surprisingly, it's actually not that bad, despite having a low budget and a clich\u00e9d plot, and it's easy to see why this became the iconic film it is today.This type of plot - martial arts contest plus intrigue - later served as a template for Van Damme's early work, including films like BLOODSPORT. Here's it's presented in a fresh and interesting way, with lots of attention to detail. It's interesting to watch the different culture on screen, with the strict rules of society, the whole mythology of the martial arts, and the strong themes of honour and vengeance running through it. This is a Chinese film through and through, despite the presence of American director Robert Clouse.The action is frequently exciting, and in the film's most memorable fight we have Lee taking on a couple of dozen enemies without breaking a sweat. He kicks hard, he blocks, and he even breaks a few crunchy necks (complete with the twig-snapping sound effect of which I have become so accustomed). Lee exerts a powerful presence on screen, and in the fight scenes he's a presence to be reckoned with. There's a spark of pure animal spirit which frequently shows itself in the actor's eyes, a total opposite to his usual gentle persona. He can be nice to you, but then he can turn around and break you in half in a second. Lee's skill was to move extremely fast, faster than all around him, and there's no denying that he's very impressive. He has quite a small figure, too, so you wouldn't think of him as a top-class fighter.The Chinese co-stars are all fine, especially the chief villain who is really having a ball and giving it his over-the-top best. Later Van Damme opponent Bolo Yeung stars as a young, cruel bodyguard. The reliable John Saxon is on hand as an American fighter and also proves himself in the action. That's what I call versatile! There's even a blaxploitation aspect with the introduction of Jim Kelly, playing an afro-ed fighter. Eagle-eyed viewers may spot Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan in bit parts.My favourite part of the film is the excellent finale, where Lee he battles the evil dictator once and for all and gets slashed up by a cruel, Freddy Krueger-ish hand. The celebrated, dream-like hall of mirrors ending, where Lee stalks his prey while distorted images play around him, is inspired and the villain's death is great, and deserved. ENTER THE DRAGON isn't an amazing film, and it's pretty lightweight in terms of storyline, motivation and reason. But it is a solid one, and a fine and fitting showcase for Lee's talents.",

            "content": "In the early seventies the West was going through a period of fascination with Kung-Fu, and at the centre of the Kung-Fu cult was the actor Bruce Lee, a household name in both Britain and America even though he made few English-language movies. Of these, \"Enter the Dragon\" was the best-known; Lee's mysterious and tragically early death at the age of 33 shortly after completing it only served to heighten public interest in the martial arts.The plot contains elements drawn from spy thrillers of the James Bond type. The story is set in Hong Kong. The hero Mr Lee (we never learn his given name) is recruited by British Intelligence on an undercover mission to infiltrate the island hideaway of the villain Mr Han. Han is outwardly a respectable businessman but in reality a master criminal involved in the drugs trade. In many ways he is reminiscent of the typical Bond villain- he lives on an island fastness, conceals a ruthless nature beneath an icily calm exterior and even strokes a fluffy white cat like those owned by Donald Pleasence in \"You Only Live Twice\" and Charles Gray in \"Diamonds Are Forever\". Han is a martial-arts enthusiast, and Lee's cover story is that he is a competitor in a martial-arts tournament which Han has organised. (Han's real motive is to recruit talented martial artists for his criminal empire). Lee also has a personal motive for wanting revenge on Han, as Han's thugs were responsible for the death of Lee's sister. Two other competitors in the tournament who play important roles in the story are Roper, a gambler on the run from the mob to whom he owes money, and Williams, an African-American on the run from the police after defending himself against two racist cops. Williams, with his afro hairstyle and laid-back attitude, is reminiscent of the \"cool dude\" characters from the blaxploitation movies which were popular around this time.In 2004, \"Enter the Dragon\" was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the United States. This was presumably on the grounds of its historic significance- it was the first Chinese martial arts film to have been produced by a major Hollywood studio, in this case Warner Bros. As a film it is not a particularly good one, and the main reason for this, apart from some tin-eared dialogue and a plot which is at times difficult to follow, is that its star, whatever his merits as a martial artist, was not particularly good as an actor. (This, rather than the supposed racial prejudice which many suspected at the time, may have been the true reason why the white actor David Carradine was preferred for the leading role in the \"Kung-Fu\" television series). In \"Enter the Dragon\" Lee only seems animated in his fight scenes; in his other scenes he seems wooden and passive, especially when he has to express any sort of strong emotion. When he tells Han \"You have offended my family and you have offended the Shaolin Temple\" he sounds less like a man burning for vengeance than a headmaster explaining to a misbehaving schoolboy why he is being punished. John Saxon, who plays Roper, was not normally regarded as Hollywood's most artistically gifted actor during this period, but compared to Lee he looks like Laurence Olivier. Jackie Chan, later to become a major martial arts star himself, has a small role here.I have to admit that the fight sequences were well done, although they lack the aesthetic qualities of some more recent martial arts films such as \"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\" or \"House of the Flying Daggers\", and will doubtless please those whose interest in Kung-Fu cinema lies in the first element of that compound noun rather than the second. Those like me, however, who prefer action sequences to be an integral part of a film rather than its sole raison d'\u00eatre, will find \"Enter the Dragon\" a disappointment. 4/10",

It is the \"Rolls Royce\" of kung-fu movies--even though the story is at times very silly! My advice is that instead of turning the film off because of its many bizarre and Austin Powers-like plot devices, just turn your brain to the neutral position and take it all in without thinking!! Otherwise, if you think too much about what's going on, your head just might explode! Don't believe me? Well read on,....The film begins at a Shaolin temple where Bruce Lee is a kung-fu teacher. His master comes to him to ask him to embark on a secret mission to stop a renegade member of their school--the evil Han. It seems that Han has forgotten the good teachings of the school and is now sort of like a kung-fu version of Dr. No or Blowfeld!! In so many, many ways, this film is like a morphing of these James Bond films with a traditional martial arts film. So, in this case, Lee is a spy sent to infiltrate Han's tournament--where the greatest martial artists and John Saxon are invited to his island fortress to compete.Once on the island, everything seems relatively normal at first. Later, you learn that Han has really bizarre detachable hands--ranging from claws to iron fists to knives. In addition, he is ruthless in his dealings with his underlings---actually having several killed in front of his guests who are there for the tournament! From this point on, it's pretty obvious Han is basically Dr. No with cooler fake hands! Who is killed and what exactly occurs is something you'll just have to find out for yourself--I just don't want to reveal too many secrets. However, the film has great action and Han's real purpose for this island fortress is eventually revealed. All you really need to know is that the film is totally cool and most guys will probably love it. Women, on the other hand, may not go for all this machismo and action and they might actually complain that the film has got an incredibly silly plot (which, of course, it has)! If you want to see a funny parody of this movie, try watching KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE. The last third or so of this AIRPLANE-style film is a knockoff of ENTER THE DRAGON and is very, very funny and insightful. I particularly liked the names given to some of the marital artists in the parody as well as voice they used for the Lee-wannabe.

The story itself is relatively formulaic and predictable, and brings nothing new or unique to the viewing audience. Lee himself sports an incredibly lean and muscular physique, and is shown to good advantage at every opportunity, though in actual combat, it seems to me that his excessive flexing would actually work to a disadvantage in wasted energy. Perhaps the intimidation factor is worth something, but so is Bolo Yeung's size and strength. In any event, I wouldn't want to get either of one of them mad at me.Simply stated, \"Enter The Dragon\" carries a modest recommendation to catch Bruce Lee at the top of his martial arts and cinematic game, but that's as generous as I can manage.

This movie,is where it all began.R.I.P Bruce Lee",

            "content": "I finally saw Enter the Dragon all the way through (in the past I caught snippets on late night TV and never got into it before changing the channel, no offense), and I must say this is indeed a highly likable, engrossing, and influential film, for all the right and wrong reasons. Right because it has influenced countless followers in the martial-arts/kung-fu genre, and can be counted on as holding some of the finest, slickest (not slick in the sense of Jackie Chan's amazing stunts or the artsy-fartsy slickness of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) fight scenes ever filmed. Wrong because behind the \"coolness\" that follows Lee in nearly every shot and his awesome skills as a fight co-coordinator on top of being an action star, is a storyline featuring villains and supporting characters that soon fizzle out in the viewers' interests. I know it's a minor squabble for such a film, many a kung-fu fan might say, but I felt that cheesy, tongue-in-cheek poking me in many scenes even as I found myself enjoying them.Lee plays, well, Lee, a master of the Shaolin school who is recruited to participate, and in undercover infiltrate, in a fighting tournament on an island that's run by a vile gangster named Han (Kien Shih), who in between fights holds slaves and opium addicts. Along with this are a couple of supporting characters also participating in the tournament including Williams (Jim Kelly) and American businessman Roper (John Saxon, who isn't actually all that bad through most of it).Like I said, the story sort of speaks for what content is there, and the cheesiness the minor characters, over-dubbing (English over English as I saw it), brings it down as a motion picture in and of itself. However, I certainly recognized that through whatever flaws come in the baseline of the script and acting is compensated by Bruce Lee- even as he makes those trademark sounds (woooaahh!) as he fights off dozens at a time, there's an unmistakable grace and magnitude to what he does here. Possibly his most famous sequence, the climax involving the mirrors, is enough to endure most of the movie, but all the other fights as well make the whole experience worthwhile. To sum the review up, I do agree with the argument that Enter the Dragon tends to be over-rated (many say this is the greatest martial arts film ever and say it without seeing the countless films that have come out of Chinese cinema), but as a star in the genre Bruce Lee helped to popularize, he proves here that HE and his philosophies & techniques (\"there is no technique\" he states early on) will endure for decades and generations to come.",

Whilst on the island, Lee also works undercover for the US government, collecting evidence of Han's criminal activities: sex slavery and manufacturing opium. Aided by fellow combatant Roper (John Saxon) and pretty secret agent Su Lin (Angela Mao), Lee successfully destroys the evil empire, but not before taking care of his sister's killers, hordes of nameless guards, formidable muscle-man Bolo, and finally, razor-handed head villain Han himself.Any film that opens with a fight between Bruce Lee and HK legend Sammo Hung is going to be great, but chuck in cool cat Saxon, his bad-ass bro' with a 'fro Jim Kelly, unforgettable bad guy Bolo Yeung, a classic Bruce nunchaku scene, and a tense final\u00e9 that is like the showdown from The Man With The Golden Gun, but better and with fists, and what you have is a legendary piece of martial arts cinema so packed with testosterone that some say simply watching it makes you perform better in bed.And I've seen it loads of times!",

He will do this by enrolling in a tournament that Han holds every three years. Lee, who wants to get revenge on Han for the death of his sister Su Lin (Angela Mao), meets two American men who have entered the tournament for their own reasons: Roper (John Saxon), who was deeply in debt back at home, and Williams (Jim Kelly), who'd been hassled by bigoted white cops.As we can see from this masterpiece, Lee had plenty of presence, and certainly could have gone a long way had his life not been tragically cut short. He's absolutely incredible when it comes to the art of kicking ass, and his co-stars, Saxon and Kelly (very cool dudes, the both of them) hold their own during the fighting scenes. What's most interesting, especially if one is watching this for the first time like this viewer did tonight, is that it isn't just one fight after another. It actually *does* have a plot, and it's great fun the way that screenwriter Michael Allin and director Robert Clouse treat it like a James Bond adventure, especially the way that the villainous Han is portrayed (he even cradles a cat at one point). The action is parcelled out carefully, with expert fight sequences staged by Lee, until the amazing final combat scenes involving many participants.Shih, Robert Wall, and Bolo Yeung are all wonderfully malevolent; other big names in this genre have roles both credited and uncredited (including Sammo Hung, Biao Yuen, and Jackie Chan), sultry Ahna Capri plays the role of the hostess, and super sexy Marlene Clark has a cameo as a secretary. Art direction, by Shen Chien, and colourful widescreen photography (lighting by Gil Hubbs, camera operation by Henry Wong and Charles Lowe) are excellent, and Lalo Schifrin contributes a suitably rousing music score. The grand scale fights are supplemented by an ingenious confrontation between Lee and Han in a hall of mirrors.It's very easy to see why this film continues to be held in high esteem by action fans everywhere.10 out of 10.",

The film is certainly a highlight reel of Lee wiping out everybody that confronts him for an altercation, making short work of his opposition. What makes Shih's villain so wonderfully colorful is his missing hand for which he often exchanges alternating weapons which slice flesh(..or in one unfortunate foe's case an iron hand which leaves him weakened and eventually defenseless). The climax in the room of mirrors where Han attempts to gain a psychological upper hand on Lee is classic and unforgettable, but almost equally as thrilling is seeing John Saxon's Roper(..whose appetite for gambling has brought him to the island in search of a victorious tournament to settle his debts, though we soon understand that he's a decent fellow with an amount of integrity)actually subdue and defeat the intimidating colossus Bolo Yeung.I'm sure many will also applaud Lee's total decimation of scar-faced brute Oharra(Robert Wall), Han's bodyguard, and the one responsible for his sister's suicide. Betty Chung is Mei Ling, an agent on the inside, who has earned Han's trust. Jim Kelly(..hate to leave him out)is the black Cobra bad ass, Williams, who gets to show his stuff against two racist cops in a flashback sequence, and an opponent(..who charted to the island on the same boat as Lee, Williams, and Roper, bullying the little Chinese staff)he quickly dispatches. Williams' battle with Han, who fights him unfairly without his knowledge, is rather heartbreaking..when Lee wipes out Han's security guards posted to keep the fighters indoors, Williams is suspected by Han. Lee's agility and speed as he continues to combat his adversaries with relative ease is exhilarating to behold. Angela Mao, as Su Lin(..Lee's sister), has an outstanding martial arts sequence, in flashback(..attempting to flee her pursuers through a village), actually startling them, showcasing amazing fighting skills before becoming trapped, ending her life instead of being raped by Oharra and his goons. The film features philosophical dialogue with Lee both teaching and learning from his mentor/adviser in the temple. I think anyone that is familiar with the film and it's production can easily see that Lee directed ENTER THE DRAGON as much as Clouse. Some striking camera work, the famous close-ups of Lee's intense expressions after dropping his enemies, and some unique use of point-of-view during fight sequences. Lalo Schifrin's memorable score hits all the right notes;the clever use of loud sound effects during the battles adds snap, crackle, and pop along with Lee's effective screeches as he incapacitates those that threaten him.",

            "content": "Unquestionably the most influential of all martial arts flicks, Enter the Dragon is martial arts filmmaking in its purest form. Counted amongst the greatest examples of its genre, notable for being the final film appearance of the incomparable Bruce Lee and equally admirable for offering a wonderful insight into the Chinese culture, the contribution this classic has made in bringing martial arts into world cinema remains unsurpassed to this day.Set in Hong Kong, Enter the Dragon tells the story of Lee, a gifted Shaolin martial artist who is invited to take part in a martial arts tournament that is being hosted on an isolated island by an excommunicated Shaolin disciple. Lee is soon approached by a British intelligence agent who wants him to go in as their spy, using the invitation as his cover, to investigate the illegal trade that takes place there, and report it back so that they can warrant a raid on the island, to which he agrees.Directed by Robert Clouse, the movie introduces all its relevant characters in a manner that succinctly covers their backstory and moves forward with fury once everyone lands on the island. The script is thoroughly devoted to its characters for it is their actions that influence the plot and it always manages to tell more in lesser words. Also noteworthy is its portrayal of martial arts on the screen, for it is illustrated in an extremely realistic way yet not without an artistic dimension added to it.Enter the Dragon may not look like the most refined martial arts film to date but considering its budget, it does a fabulous job with all the available resources. What also helps the film is its stringent focus on keeping the action grounded yet instil a mythical vibe to it, something that Bruce Lee is able to deliver quite effortlessly. Cinematography is carried out amazingly well for each event is comprehensively captured, Editing paces it brilliantly though there are minor inconsistencies at times and while the background score is true to its heritage, it also packs in a playful element.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Bruce Lee, John Saxon, Jim Kelly, Shih Kien & others and although it's clearly a one-man show, the supporting cast is no slouch in their given roles. Kelly makes a solid impression from the start & steals almost every scene he's in. Saxon also does well with his role and his chemistry with every person he interacts with only adds more weight to the character he plays. Kien plays the antagonist and slowly but steadily manages to turn his character into a clever & ruthless crime lord. Rest of them play mere caricatures but it never becomes an issue.However, what catapults Enter the Dragon into a league of its own is the input by Bruce Lee who's an absolute delight to watch in what turned out to be his last appearance on film but then, it's also his most memorable work that contributed immensely in further enriching his legacy. Lee commands the screen with an instantly captivating presence that rivals the best in the business yet it comes blended with a composure of someone at peace with himself. As an actor, he delivers. As an entertainer, he thrills. And as a martial artist, he's a magician. This is undoubtedly his most iconic role and deservingly so.On an overall scale, Enter the Dragon is an immortal classic that has continued to popularise the legend of Bruce Lee to this date and will continue to do so for a foreseeable future. It also includes many martial artists who'd later take this art form into newer realms, best example being Jackie Chan. No matter how many martial arts movies one may have seen, the action segments featuring Lee in this picture are still unmatched in the sheer breathtaking jolt they provide. Just like everyone else in that Lee vs O'Hara fight, I couldn't help but stand & applaud every blow that Bruce Lee landed on his opponents and that's truly a rarity. The quintessential martial arts movie featuring the greatest martial artist of all time, Enter the Dragon is essential viewing. Highly recommended.",

There are movie fans out there who wouldn't know Sonny Chiba, Bolo Yeung, Gordon Liu, or even Jet Li if they walked up and smacked 'em in the face, but more than 35 years after his death, they recognize Bruce Lee. The man was simply incredible! It's a real shame he died shortly after completing Enter the Dragon because the movie offers the promise of so much to come that was unfortunately never realized.Bruce Lee (cleverly named Lee) is recruited by the government to attend a martial arts tournament on an island owned by a man named Han. The government suspects Han of any number of illegal activities (drugs, slavery, etc), but they need Lee to find the evidence. Lee's desire to get Han takes a personal turn when he discovers that Han's men were responsible for the death of his sister.I'm really at a loss to come up with anything original to write about Enter the Dragon that hasn't already been said a thousand times. In short, it's one awesome butt-kicking movie from the word go. Watching Bruce Lee (even in choreographed movie fights) in his prime is simply amazing. The man was like poetry in motion. The use of his body as a weapon and the controlled violence he displays are like nothing else I've ever seen. He takes Enter the Dragon from an average martial arts movie with a fairly predictable plot and makes it something for the ages. I should also give some of the credit to the supporting cast. John Saxon, Jim Kelly, Kien Shih, and the rest are more than capable in their roles.

I actually expected Jones from the 'Police Academy' (1984-94) films to show up and do his voice trick, that's how much of a farce I thought it was, because he would have fit right in. If this had been produced by the 'National Lampoons' or 'Naked Gun' teams it could have been hilarious deliberately and without many changes at all.Even Williams, played by Jim Kelly, was a racial stereotype, I thought at one point that he was going to turn out to be 'Shaft' (1971/2000), because he was just such a cool, no nonsense cat.It also seemed like John Saxon, as Roper, was only added to be a recognisable American face, in order to win the audience, because he stuck out like a saw thumb and he wasn't even the corniest!In some ways it felt like a comic book crossover, where they gather all the greatest characters together for a larger story arc, each one being tested to see what they can achieve and how far they will and can go. It was that simplistic.The acting is incredibly bad and some of the fights were almost like watching 'WWE', in the respect that they looked very fake and forced.Other fights weren't bad, but at times it was really obvious that they were choreographed and Bruce Lee's face and the noises that he made, as he fought and then paused after each knock out, were just bizarre.On the plus side I enjoyed the very 70's groovy soundtrack, but the whole film was also very seventies in general and not the good bits of the decade.I found it very hard to believe that no animals were harmed in the making of the film and some of the random elements in the film needed a bit more explanation, for instance the room of magic mirrors, or did everyone have one of those back then?It's a badly dubbed, American attempt at a traditional martial arts film.

Second was Han's bodyguard (Robert Wall) was responsible for Lee's sister's death. Also involved in the tournament were Roper (John Saxon) and Williams (John Kelly). Both had their own reasons to fight in tournament. Roper was running from his debts and earn his money, whilst Williams was running from racism and the police in America.Enter the Dragon is the first martial-arts film that was produced by Hollywood and this film combines the best elements of Hollywood and Hong Kong cinema. Bruce Lee was the man responsible for making the Hong Kong film industry the way it is now.The first and foremost important thing in a martial-arts film is the action, and my, it's very good. There are brilliant fight-scene as you would expect from the master known as Bruce Lee. There are iconic scene in the hall of mirrors, to one-on-one fights, to Bruce Lee's skill with weapons. I personally really like John Kelly's style of fighting in this. Bruce Lee set out to make a film with heart and he brought in his philosophies of martial-arts in this film, particularly about the idea to overcome style and was against uniformity. This made Enter the Dragon a cut above the rest.Enter the Dragon is an essential film from the 70s and the Martial-Arts genre. It's a shame that Bruce Lee died because he would have done more. If you get the 2-disc Enter the Dragon DVD you would also get some excellent footage and fight scenes from Game of Death as it should have been.",

This movie has immortalized him and will be remembered, ALWAYS! \"Enter The Dragon\" is a piece of work take is taken very seriously in life. Lee plays a former fighter who goes out on an island fortress, that is owed by a rogue monk named Han(Kien Shih). Along with Lee is Roper(John Saxon) and Williams(James Kelly, 1 year later, he does \"Black Belt Jones\" and its sequel \"Hot Potato\"). These two men are from the military, and they are skilled too in the martial arts. I like the parts where everyone takes a shot at various opponents. The massive \"Bolo\" (Bolo Yeung, aka Yang Sze) took out the four guards who did their jobs poorly: Snapping the spine of one, wrung out the one who tried to cheap shoot Bolo, stomps the other dead, and he permanently puts the last one to sleep. It was great when Lee took out O'Hara(Bob Wall) with the high stomp. Roper did his job well against Bolo when he neutralized him by \"hatching the dragon eggs\". The ultimate fight scene was great as well. Enter The Dragon has it's magic: Philosophy, discipline, wisdom, and wonder. The Dragon lives on FOREVER! 5 STARS!!",

In this film, his main nemesis is the evil \"Han\", a desperado from Lee's own Temple. The self-sufficient Han (Kien Shih) lives on an island fortress complete with brawny bodyguards and beautiful ladies who also know a thing or two about fighting. Lee and allies Roper (John Saxon) and Williams (Jim Kelly) infiltrate Han's island, where most of the film's action takes place.The plot is really secondary to the presence of Bruce Lee and an ensemble of fighting sequences that are well choreographed, but redundant. To enhance drama, the sounds of punches, slaps, hits, jabs, and kicks are all highly amplified. My favorite sequence is near the end when Lee fights Han in the great hall of mirrors, a large maze-like room containing multiple mirrors. Here, Lee must confront not only his physical nemesis but also unreal images of his nemesis as reflected in the maze of mirrors. What is real, and what is illusion? That's Lee's dilemma.As with most films, the main problem with \"Enter The Dragon\" is the script. Here, the plot is weak and predictable. The relationship between Lee and his two allies is not well explained; why are Roper and Williams here? Dialogue contains minimal subtext that I could find.Lee's character is something of a Johnny-one-note, much the same as James Bond in the 007 movies of the 1960s. But whereas 007 and enemies resort to high-tech gadgets for weapons, Lee and company use their own bodies. It's this difference that makes Lee's character seem real and human, vis-\u00e0-vis the cartoon figures in other action films, including those in the fictional James Bond series.Hairstyles, music, and plot in \"Enter The Dragon\" convey a very 1960s/70s mood, also in sync with the James Bond movies. Indeed, I find that \"Enter The Dragon\" parallels the 007 films like \"Goldfindger\" and \"From Russia With Love\" in many ways, except of course that \"Enter The Dragon\" brings in Asian sensibilities to the action.I like \"Enter The Dragon\" as much for what is not included as for what is, most notably ... guns; their absence is a pleasant change. But the main attraction is the charismatic Bruce Lee, with his flair for showmanship and his enormous physical strength and agility. Despite a weak script, \"Enter The Dragon\" is a high-caliber film specifically because, and only because, of Bruce Lee.",

            "content": "1st watched 12/21/2013 -- 7 out of 10(Dir-Robert Clouse): Well done martial arts film that shows everyone why Bruce Lee was such an icon in this genre. The movie starts at a distinguished martial arts school where Bruce's character is a student and is made aware by a teacher about a former other student named Hann who is disgracing their reputation and should be stopped. Hann now inhabits an island where he trains his own group and has a tournament every three years. A government official wants Bruce to participate in the tournament with the intent of uncovering any wrongdoing by Hann so they can bring him before the authorities. Lee has dual motives for taking Hann and his group down because his sister was being tormented by some of Hann's group and killed herself instead of being disgraced by them. Although Lee's teaching is not to be aggressive he forgoes this because of all his issues with the group --- asking forgiveness at his dead sisters' graveside. The fighting scenes are extremely well done with a truly unique mirrored-room scene near the end of the movie. Bruce's character adds some humor and a lot of facial expressions that are his trademark almost showing the viewer what is going on without seeing the impacts. The movie is spoken primarily in English and does show a little of Bruce's roughness with the language but he primarily acts with his body almost like a silent movie star. There are scenes that are downright hilarious primarily because of what he does. The philosophy of the school is kind of lost in the movie in this last film of Bruce's but that was intended. The movie somewhat comes across more like an American-revenge movie, but Bruce pulls it off much better than some of the retread types that I've seen in this genre. Overall this is a very well done movie and made me want to see more of this master's films.",

This is Bruce Lee's, first and last big budget international feature that went on to be a huge success and instant genre classic that inspired cinema fans and film makers for decades to come. Bruce Lee is in top form and in his own class of physical and fighting shape than anyone seen on the screen ever. Bruce is to enter a martial arts tournament on an island privately owned by a guy named Han. Han has his hands dirty in all kinds of illegal activity such as drug trafficking and prostitution. The authorities enlist the help of Bruce to obtain evidence on Han, so interested governments may act. There is no shortage of martial arts tournament movies, but Enter The Dragon is unique. The film is very colorful and stylish, with lush set designs and costumes. Enter The Dragon also has exceptional supporting actors John Saxon and Jim Kelly, who both prove to be great fighters with tons of charisma. However, this is Bruce Lee's show and there has never been anything like him. He displays searing screen presence, coolness and total intensity. Plus to watch Bruce fight,is truly amazing. The fights are all choreographed by Bruce and set a high standard for martial arts movies to come. The character and story development are excellent. Lalo Schifrin did a very cool and stylish score, that in my opinion is some of his best work. Robert Wall and Bolo Yeung are great heavies and both legends Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan appear as well.

You have the Eastern philosophy mumbo-jumbo double talk that passes as wisdom and you have some good martial arts fight scenes. Although years of more flashy martial arts films might have watered this down for many.The first thing to prepare yourself for, if you know of Enter the Dragon only by reputation, is that it has surprisingly little martial arts in it. Most of the movie is talking and not terribly interesting talking either. The plot is paper thin. OK, by itself that's not a huge issue. Most of the plots to action films are thin. People don't watch an action movie or a martial arts movie for the plot. They watch it to see people kick each other. So there's your problem. The ratio of people kicking each other versus people acting like they're actually in a real film with a quality script is unevenly tilted towards the latter. There just isn't enough of interest beyond the few Lee martial arts sequences to warrant this film's reputation. It's a watchable movie but nothing better than that.",

I like to think of it as a beginners guide to the genre of the martial arts and a film that set the tone for many years to come. The Western world has been pandering at this film ever since its release and this marks the end of an era for Bruce Lee who sadly passed away before the final product was released.\"Enter the Dragon\" is no doubt one of the greatest films of its genre, but it is still not the greatest movies ever to be released. It's not my all time-favourite martial arts movie there is, but it is up there among the top ten. Sure it opened the door and the hearts of millions while at the same time a myriad of rip-offs tried to emulate the movie, but most them had failed. Every time I see \"Enter the Dragon\" it make me feel a bit sad at times. It was the last movie ever made by Bruce Lee who unfortunately died three weeks before the film was released. I kept thinking to myself that when Lee saw the pre-release copy, if this was the movie that would have made him a star and that he would become a legend in the film world if he had lived longer. I wasn't alive so I fully don't know the answers to that.The main story to \"Enter the Dragon\" is about three participants Lee (Bruce Lee), Roper (John Saxon) and Williams (Jim Kelly) in a tournament on Han Island, set up by a Shaolin Monk Han (Kien Shih) who uses this island for his competition and for shady dealings including drug smuggling and prostitution. Roper and Williams, former Vietnam war alums are competing for other personal reasons. But Lee is assigned to investigate the island by the police. Lee also feels it is his destiny to take down this shady fiend since Han and his misfits take full responsibility for the murder of his little sister as a result of Han's activities. Sure the story is narrow- thin and the outcome is predictable, but the fight scenes are there to serve a purpose to this story. The fight scenes are some of the best ever displayed and are never short of entertaining. Roper, Williams and Han seem to be at the top of their game as they all have excellent fight scenes and Bruce Lee was physically and mentally the best shape of his life. His training, speed, and tenacity can forgive any of the plot-holes that this movie has to offer. When it comes to kung-fu action films, the fighting is what you brought your ticket for. Even the lesser prominent characters churn in some excellent fight scenes including Sammo Hung, Bolo Yeong, Bob Wall, Yuen Biao and a teenager named Jackie Chan. The technical features are also a sight for sore eyes and that includes the big budget sets, the extras playing here, the props, costumes and the music score has everything to set the tone as the truly original martial arts action film. There might be better fight sequences out there, but in \"Enter the Dragon\", it doesn't come any bigger.While the acting is very good for what it is, and the plot is satisfying to the point where it carries to the action. But the fight scenes are what sells this movie. If this is not your type of movie, then I suggest you find another type of movie that suits you. For martial arts action lovers, \"Enter the Dragon\" is something for everyone to enjoy. If you have the DVD it good to watch many times, you may even find something new through every viewing.",

Jackie Chan has made 10 films better than this and Jet Li half a dozen.That isn't to say that this film wasn't a landmark at the time of release and that it doesn't show massive promise, it does both of those things. But that is a little like saying were it not for injury or circumstance player X would be a better basketball player than Michael Jordan because, y'know he showed the signs after all! Don't worry too much pony-tailed readers, I still view Bruce Lee as an icon who broke new ground and ushered in the era which saw Jackie and Jet find success, and he was also a man with amazing charisma and screen presence, but black and white films were amazing to people once too, then time passed and we realised that Big Bird was actually yellow.Regardless Enter the Dragon will still go down in history as Bruce's masterwork.In the opening scenes Bruce consults with his master who it must be said is a total martial arts film clich\u00e9 complete with wispy glued on beard and a bad dub that uses phrases even the Wu-Tang would find too corny to sample. The early scenes show that Bruce is indeed a great fighter but that he should never grow complacent and stop learning.Shortly after Bruce is asked by the CIA to use his invite to a secret martial arts tournament to gain access to operations run by a bad guy named Mr Han to find evidence of naughtiness. Han is another villainous clich\u00e9 whose every word is either a threat or a pompous boast, he even carries around a white cat that he continually strokes! He hosts the tournament every few years on his isolated island and invites only the best of the best along hoping to recruit some to his crew and business, once there the security level is very high. To amplify Bruce's awareness level he is told by his Dad that one of Mr Han's henchmen was directly responsible for the death of his sister.Also invited to the tournament are the up-and-coming Williams (Jim Kelly with a bad-ass afro) and the more experienced crafty veteran Roper (John Saxon who somehow gets equal billing with Lee), along with some other cannon-fodder.Once on the island there is an opening night grand welcoming banquet, after which there are chicks for all, four or five for Williams alone.Bruce has a quick snoop and is only somewhat amazed to find there are large underground rooms in which various nefarious things may or may not be happening, along with many poor and needy men who are imprisoned for no apparent reason.The next day at the tournament Han tells one and all that he knows someone was looking around and he unleashes his pet Bolo Yeung on the guards as a warning\u0085 but he doesn't know Bruce very well.The first man Bruce faces in the tournament is the treacherous henchman responsible for the death of his sister, needless to say Bruce moves onto the next round and the other guy doesn't move again\u0085 The tournament instantly becomes irrelevant when the following night Bruce is nabbed in the act in mid-snoop, cue a 25-on-one battle that he is winning easily until he is trapped and isolated. Even though the fight is choreographed in a far more fluid and realistic manner when compared with the older kung-fu movies there is still the sense that attackers are counting down for their shot as Bruce dispatches them, the brilliantly executed chaos of some of Jackie's better works are non-existent here.The film moves towards the climactic showdown and as soon as we learn that Mr Han has a metal hand it is always going to come down to him and Lee going one on one. The final fight is well staged but again just doesn't have the visceral qualities and a sense of danger that other films that arrived later had, and once Bruce wins there are a couple of clumsy thumbs ups and the credits roll.Final Rating \u2013 8 / 10. Don't get me wrong, this is still a worthy film despite the fact it hasn't aged well. It is more a tragedy that Bruce didn't live long enough to add to his cinematic legacy and set the bar even higher for Jackie Chan and those that followed.",

            "content": "1973's Enter the Dragon was America's...and my first foray into the kung-fu world of Bruce Lee. Prior to this film, Lee was an international superstar but has seen limited success in the States. This film changed everything. It became a very successful film, but sadly is the swansong for Lee due to his untimely death. I was incredibly surprised by how much I enjoyed this feature. The story is borderline silly at times, but I was taken aback how the story became a \"low-rent\" spy thriller a la James Bond...which I enjoyed. Lee has proven himself as a great actor and seeing his fighting moves impressed me. I try to avoid martial art films because they do not appeal to me, but I need to catch up on Bruce Lee's work.\nDue to Lee's global success, Warner Brothers joined forces with Lee to produce the movie and bring it to a wider American audience. The production received a very modest budget, but director Robert Crouse and his team made every penny count. The screenplay was written by Michael Allin and it was considered an advanced screenplay. What I mean it that it gave equal and fair treatment to different races. Having heroic characters played by Black, Asian, and White people was unusual for its time. It was one of the main reasons why it reached an international audience. In addition to some excellent choreographed fighting scenes, the script manages some great lines. I liked the scene where Lee explained his style of fighting is \"fighting without fighting.\" A very wise human! I was expecting plenty of martial arts, but the script combined it with a thrilling, albeit a bit preposterous spy film which totally intrigued me.\nThis film takes place in Hong Kong in 1973. Lee (Bruce Lee) is a master of martial arts at a Shaolin Temple and believes his martial art skills are an essence of his spirituality. He is visited by a British law officer who invites him to a martial arts tournament held by Han, a reclusive billionaire who used to be a part of the Temple, but now is on the other side of the law. Han has initial reservations, but they quickly disappear when he learns that Han's American sidekick was behind the death of his sister. He is now tasked to find out about Han's drug and prostitution activities. In addition to Lee, two Americans, Roper (John Saxon) and Williams (Jim Kelly) also attend the proceedings. As the tournament begins, the three men are at the mercy of Han and his people.\nWhen I think of the name, \"Bruce Lee,\" I think of martial arts expert before I think of him as an actor. This movie proves that he has some excellent acting ability, and I became emotionally invested in his character. Of course, he puts good use to his martial arts. People have complained that he does the same moves in each of his films (I have yet to find out), but I wouldn't really care because they are awesome! The other actors deliver good performances although I would not say they did anything special, but serviceable enough to act alongside Lee. After all, this film is all about the power of Bruce Lee.\nOverall, Enter the Dragon is a very fun movie. Yes, the story is silly, but Bruce Lee manages to save the story and create something fun out of it...and delivered real emotion. Lee would have been a mainstay in Hollywood if not for his premature death. Still, he managed to create something special...and perhaps a passing of the torch. Another man gifted in the kung-fu arts is seen as an extra...and that is Jackie Chan. This is a worthy action film worth seeing to see the gifts of Bruce Lee.\nMy Grade: B+",

But these are minor quibbles in what is (I think) one of the best martial arts film ever. There's no denying the great fight scenes (choreographed by Bruce) displayed in the film and although nearly 40 years old they're very impressive. With nowadays technology everyone can be a martial arts fighter but with blood and sweat Bruce painstakingly created some of the best fights ever caught on film. \"Enter the Dragon\" also has that great 70's vibe going for it; especially in the beginning. Great jazzy score, hip (at the time I guess) dialog and, of course, great fashion. Also, it is undeniably atmospheric once it enters the remote island where, admittedly, the very strange tournament is taking place. Once there the action takes front and center. The pace is good and the showdown in the Room of Mirrors is legendary for a reason. Bruce is quite good in the lead and it's nice to hear his actual voice for a change. Great thespian skills aren't required here but he's very capable and in the action department he simply has no equal. The biggest surprise here probably is how well genre hopping legend John Saxon equips himself in the fight scenes. The guy is always a solid actor and, although he's not in Bruce's league, he's quite the karate kid (or grown up).",

My favorite Bruce Lee movie will always be The Big Boss, and nobody can ever sway from that decision. The Big Boss just seems to have the ultimate excellence in Lee's martial arts work. The flaw here is that Lee is only one of the three stars showcased and although Jim Kelly and John Saxon are likable enough heroes, it's really only the scenes of Lee that make this the classic it is, especially considering his infectious charisma and his freakishly fast reflexes. Of course the action sequences are all excellent, the acting is strong and the pacing is perfect but it just lacks that something that The Big Boss had. Still that's not to say I don't love this movie, I easily hold this is as Lee's second best movie and I own all of his movies on DVD. I also didn't like as much the James Bond feel given off as well. However these are all minor complaints, since this contains the signature action that will make you a Bruce Lee junkie. In fact this is the movie that got me into him in the first place, so this movie is indeed like a gateway drug. A gateway drug to a genre where Bruce Lee used only Nunchucks and his lightning quick reflexes to defeat anyone put in front of him.

            "content": "British Intelligence recruits martial arts expert Lee to compete in a tournament on an island that is hosted by a dangerous criminal mastermind in an attempt to uncover his criminal operations.The last completed feature film from one of the world's most renowned martial arts masters brings about a highly action packed plot with some splendid choreography and for many, showcased some of Bruce Lee's best talents in acting and art.This being the first Bruce Lee film I have seen I was pleasantly surprised by his clam nature throughout but gathering enough gusto and vitality to portray the martial arts protagonist. His vision and expression for kung fu and fighting is brilliant, perfectly demonstrated in the final act and throughout.The plot begins with Lee being taught the arts and finally appreciating the inner qualities of a true martial arts expert, which is enough for the British secret services to pick him up and send him off on a mission to exploit the dangerous criminal.When Lee is given the outline of the history of Han the criminal, I was immediately reminded of a James Bond lined story. Now, when released that would have been a fantastic plaudits but now the perception of Britain's most famous spy has been changed over the last four decades.When Sean Connery opened the gates in the 1960's in Dr No everyone immediately saw something suave and unique, an appreciation of crime with added humour and excellent sophistication. After some awkward films and the descent in the late nineties and early noughties the perception and formality received many bad publicity but Daniel Craig's reprisal has revitalised the franchise and through all the films, it is easy to see a bit of this 1973 picture live on throughout.But is it as good as the early Bonds? Well yes because it takes a martial foreign art and places it in a very English story. Kind of like the Leo Di Caprio Romeo and Juliet picture, a modern setting with old language. This is brilliant technique, a refreshing and gutsy attempt to define action and mystery.Initially the plot steadies itself and when we learn about the tragedy of Lee's sister it becomes a quest for revenge. This initial back story is lost until one fleeting moment, as is the unbalanced narration.The film's biggest selling point is the action, delivering full throttle power to the hearts of the viewers. The one on one fight sequences are well staged whilst the climatic good versus evil moment is wonderfully placed in the halls of mirrors, which is fair to say is even replicated in The Man with the golden gun, but this is by far greater. In a way it is even scary.Lee's film brings around a fantastic feeling of full throttle action that can occasionally feel dated but regardless, is irreplaceable kick action.",

It may not be the best but it is the trigger for the improvement of action cinema, the consolidation of future great stars and the demonstration that even a Westerner can make good movies if he is advised by Asians. Although everything has been said about this film, some things can be emphasized: if you join a good idea with great talent, something excellent will come out; that if you have the best in a certain field of action, it is certain that you will achieve something extraordinary and that if your star is the supreme symbol of what you want to show, then you will have a masterpiece. Bruce Lee transformed the lives of millions of people with this film; the frenzy that he achieves in every spectator is comparable to that of an epiphany. From the music to the production design we can see that this is a work made by those who were lucky enough to make history. The rhythm of the film is not sustained and even declines at the end (the final duel does not have as much quality as previous situations). Despite this, it is concluded that this work is the supreme testament of Bruce Lee accompanied by great stars who in due course showed what they were made of. It is a must see for anyone who loves action movies. Remarkable.",

            "content": "It wasn't until 1979 that I came upon the name of Bruce Lee; and only because it was in that year that I began my long association with karate. At that time, many in the martial arts world were still mourning the death of the most famous and perhaps most gifted of all martial warriors. Hence, I dived right in...Soon after, I saw this movie in a cinema some 35 years ago. And, just recently, I had another look. According to IMDb trivia, the film was shot with no sound, all of which was dubbed in later, of course. Unhappily, it shows occasionally when an attacker receives a kick or punch from the Master or others like John Saxon, Jim Kelly: the out of sync of the visual and audio is noticeable at times.Still, it's exciting action as we all came to expect, flawlessly executed and devastating to those who get in the way of Lee when he's doing what he naturally did. Truly, I doubt there will be another like him again. And, when you see Lee go to town with nunchuckus, I recall that Jackie Chan (as one of the extras) said that Lee whacked him on the head accidentally during a practice session.Also noteworthy is a young Sammo Hung who gets beat up by Lee in the opening sequence plus Biao Yuen who is one of the tournament fighters on Han's island \u2013 fighters I knew nothing about when I saw this for the first time.There are enough reviews here to flesh out the story and even a good synopsis on the title page. So, I need add nothing further \u2013 except to say, it's interesting to compare the Hong Kong of then with the city of today. How times change...It's a film for martial arts followers only, I think. There are comparable films and fighters today, of course, but none to equal the martial arts spirit of Bruce Lee.For those who are new to Bruce Lee, I would recommend seeing all of his early movies made in China before Enter the Dragon. Unlike Jackie Chan, who used humor so effectively, Lee was forever the dramatist, righting wrongs, fighting the good fight and upholding justice in his inimitable way. Not to be missed, in my opinion.Nor this one.Highly recommended.November 2011",

            "review_title": "The Final Word in Martial Arts Mayhem",
            "content": "MASTER PLAN: deal in opium, prostitution and recruit henchmen. 'An island fortress, really,' our hero is told. Indeed. When Chinese peasantry used an early form of martial arts to defend themselves, little did they dream it would culminate in this. Bruce Lee and his characters represent the peasants - the little man, seemingly innocuous - who can fend off Communist forces, groups of gangsters or melodramatic villains such as we see here, all with the power of an intercepting fist. Lee's character here is transplanted into an adventure derivative of a James Bond action thriller, so popular in the sixties and continuing into the seventies, with Lee the special agent. However, the story presents a trinity of heroes here to up the ante: a Chinese (Lee), a white man (Saxon) and a black man (Kelly). It's a simple yet so effective presentation and a wonder it's not done more often (probably because everyone knows it couldn't surpass what we see here, anyway). All three heroes have a lot of hubris: though Lee is on a mission, it's tainted by his need for revenge. Saxon, as Roper, is hedonistic, with a serious gambling problem, a target of the mob back home. Kelly, as Williams, as with many black heroes in the seventies, is a target of racist cops and probably wanted on various charges. These back-stories lend a bittersweet tone to the action and the whole thing comes across as a minor epic-like morality tale, the kind we would tell our grandkids 30 years from now and on.The plot itself seems quite simple: all 3 heroes proceed to the island of master villain Han, who holds a martial arts tournament every 3 years. Han, again, is patterned on Bond villains such as Dr.No, having created his own private kingdom and beyond the law in most ways. Han has his own deadly henchmen: the brutal Oharra and the Herculean Bolo, who appear to be more than a match for the heroes. Yet, even in the progression of this plot, there are moments of surprising audacity; consider the early scene of Lee on the junker in the atmospheric Hong Kong harbor. A flashback begins with Lee and his uncle, who begins to tell Lee something; then, we're in a flashback within the flashback, which details the fate of Lee's sister. It's so smooth, so integrated, we don't even notice these transitions. Clouse is never given much credit as director, but he and his editor deserve some kudos; check out, as another example, the quiet arrival of the heroes to the island - the shot widens gradually and suddenly we're observing a hundred martial arts masters going thru their paces. The audience is plunged into an exotic, huge location, in a style reminiscent of those great epics of the previous decade, whether they be historical or war, and this flavor would continue throughout the film, especially in that early banquet scene. This was the big leagues of martial arts action and everyone knew what they were doing.Saxon's experience and Kelly's fresh energy as actors served them well in their edgy heroic roles and they're very good but, as we all know, the one who emerged as the most dynamic superstar of the decade was Lee. He set new standards, such as being a coiled spring on screen, and has yet to be equaled on those terms. This also instructs us all on what it takes to become a Chinese superstar in cinema: physical near-perfection and nearly superhuman abilities. But even this might only make one a good fighter and not much else; Lee radiated charisma and feral intensity on screen. It's amazing that American audiences of '73 were probably most familiar with him as just the Green Hornet's sidekick on TV. Here, he's the undisputed leader. And, what places viewers on notice is the unsettling possibility that he really is lethal, not just an actor; watching him in action on film makes us all wince at least once, when we're not wide-eyed. No one, before or since, could do great fight scenes on film like Lee - no one. There probably would have been sequels to this had Lee not gone into legend, more missions for the invincible Dragon-agent; as it is, this instant classic spawned a parody - 'A Fistful of Yen' - in the \"Kentucky Fried Movie\" and imitations such as \"Kill or Be Killed.\" Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so they say.

            "content": "I have watched this film more times than I can count and I never tire of it. Bruce Lee sadly never got to enjoy the phenomenal success or to know that over 30 years later it is still inspiring many film makers. it is hard to find a film or TV show today that doesn't contain some Martial Arts, yet when Lee made this film it was very rare to see real martial artists on screen or if you did, it was reduced to being badly done by comic book characters. But we can now see Chinese actors playing roles that do not even hint at their being Chinese; unlike the way things were when this film was made. From beginning to end you just marvel at the skill of Bruce Lee, he looks totally believable unlike many that followed or copied him in later films. Jackie Chan makes great Martial Arts films as does Jet Lee, Jean Claude Van Damme etc, but their careers would not have been possible without Bruce Lee and this fantastic film. There have been ( in my opinion ) better Martial Arts films, The Secret Rivals series of films for example, but this was a cross-over to appeal to the west and it surely did that. I remember watching it for the first time in the cinema open mouthed at the things I was watching. Lee of course steals the film but the other actors do their part. Angela Mao as his sister shows her Martial Arts skill as does Bob Wall, it is little known that Bruce liked working with Bob because he was able to actually make contact with him ( something that would probably not be allowed today ) The tournament scene with Bob Wall as Ohara is a master class in martial Arts and the speed of Bruce is so remarkable that even with modern digital technology it is hard to see his moves, although the beginning moves are pure Wing Chum Kung Fu. Jim Kelly looks great and does what Bruce wanted him to do, which was be a Martial Arts version of Muhammad Ali. His corny lines still make me laugh even now. John Saxon looks unconvincing and stiff and it is hard to believe the fight scene where he beats Bolo. Most fans would have loved to have seen a fight between Bolo and Bruce.\nInterestingly in the original concept Jim Kelly's character was going to be the one who survived and fought along with Bruce to defeat Han and his henchmen, in my opinion this would have made this an even better movie since Jim Kelly looked more convincing and impressive as a fighter than John Saxon.\nThe fights with Han are OK but he looks amateurish against Bruce Less vastly superior skill. The underground fight with the guards has some amazing scenes, the Nunchaku scene being a classic. Also Jackie Chan is the guard who gets his neck broken by Bruce. ( Jackie was also the stunt man who doubled for the Japanese who gets kicked through the wall at the end of Fist of Fury ) Jackie is also one of the henchmen who gets hit by the long stick that Bruce uses, in fact Jackie was actually hit for real during this scene, something that Bruce apologized to him for, but only after finishing the scene.\nOf course the story itself is nonsense and a lot of the acting very second rate, but you don't watch this film for the story or the acting, you watch it because Bruce Lee is in it.\nIt is also worth mentioning that this movie changed cinema in that following the success of this film all action movies included Martial arts and fight scenes became more realistic.\nThis still rates as one of my favorite movies of all time and few if any action movies have been as exciting and few martial arts actors come close to the electrifying screen presence of Bruce Lee.",

            "content": "A favourite mixture of camp, high adventure, culture clash and martial arts excellence, ETD survives today as the quintessential Bruce Lee film and breaks down into a straightforward structure, which works to minimise narrative subtlety, while simultaneously showcasing Lee's inimitable fighting talents. The backgrounds of the two main supporting characters, Roper (John Saxon) and Williams (Jim Kelly) is given in two flashback sequences, then hardly referred to again. No one would pretend that the dialogue, even when loaded with Lee's own private significance, is anywhere more than adequate. Much conversation, whether the fighter's own oriental lisping, or through the emphasis on arch phrases (apparently characteristic of men of action), provides unintentional pleasure.The most interesting part of the film's spoken elements is at the start, where in Lee's so-called 'Monk Scene' (missing from some release prints) then also a little later, he reveals something of his personal philosophy. Lee, we are told, has taken his fighting technique 'beyond the mere physical level - to the point of spiritual insight'. For the fighter of this calibre opponents and all immediate combat concerns vanish, to be replaced by a notion of committed distancing, or 'emotional content'('not anger'). Interestingly, Lee remarks that each fight 'should be like a small play - but one played seriously'. One can see that it is from a series of such martial 'dramas', gradually increasing in scale, that the tension and drive of the film emanates, rather than any traditional development of character.Lee is at the center of the film. Throughout he provides moral, physical and sexual standards against which others are measured - most conspicuously, westerners. There is a revealing juxtaposition between the ultra-fit fighter and the middle aged, bespectacled Braithwaite, who briefs him at the beginning of the film. While Lee has a personal interest in Han's destruction, one immediately understandable and honourable, the Englishman's professionalism is guarded and generalised. He represents only 'gatherers of information upon which governments can act'. Braithwaite offers Lee a drink, (which of course the ascetic fighter declines), and confirms Lee's unspoken judgement on the unattractiveness of firearms ('Any bloody fool can pull a trigger'). Naturally it is Braithwaite, who is tucked up in bed, while Lee battles against superior odds out in the field. On the outward-bound junk, Lee proves his moral superiority to an arrogant competitor, leaving him adrift in a boat. Finally, by the end of the film, after winning every contest, the topless and blood-tasting Lee provides a far more convincing image of physical potency than ever do the sexually active Roper and Williams.In real life Lee had an ongoing concern for the Oriental poor, seeing martial arts as one way to restore their dignity. His first film, 'The Big Boss/Tang Shan da Xiong' (1971) set in and around an ice plant in its way is involved with commercial exploitation and corruption. For 'Enter The Dragon', it was partly through his insistence that director Clouse filmed the memorable scenes in Hong Kong harbour, setting the arriving contestants amidst a floating shanty town. When, during the cavern fight, Lee finds himself in combat alongside the pens holding Han's mute prisoners (his 'bar room dregs'), his endeavours are explicitly and economically connected with the rights of those dispossessed. We realise then that he is fighting as much for their freedom as for Braithwaite's secret masters, his sister's memory or the honour of his temple. Fittingly, it is these discarded men who will eventually overrun Han's island, restoring their rights.In fact Han's private island is a dictatorship; one in which he 'lives like a king', in which Nazi salutes of raised, punching fists greet the newly landed competitors, and where the ubiquitous fighting outfits are also a uniform of repression. The tournament becomes a showcase for Han's philosophy, as well as a convenient recruitment means. And first thing ashore, Clouse wisely lets his camera pan over a vista of striking fists with the martial shouts they engender. Like a Refensthal images of a Hitler rally, and aided by Schifrin's insistent, garish score, such discipline en masse makes for a thrilling, ominous, spectacle.Such an island also provides an excellent proving ground for Lee's talents. But apart the relatively short opening taster bout, he hardly lifts an arm until reaching Han's enclave - and even then spends long minutes as a calm observer of the opening bouts. In between he exercises more guile and restraint, sly humour and cat-like athleticism than the expected muscle. By then of course, we have seen just how his sister has been killed, and know he itches to tackle Han's bullying bodyguard O'Hara. Lee is coiled and not yet sprung. The audience is eager to see him fight, just as we know hero Lee is himself aching to exact revenge. The resulting tension, a martial anxiousness, goes a long way to papering over any weaknesses in dialogue and leads to the highest expectations.Fortunately for the viewer such expectations are fully justified. Lee's legendary martial artistry is awe-inspiring, enough to catapault the film into the front rank of action movies. Frequently shown in slow motion so that the camera could catch his rapid-fire actions, he fights O'Hara, numerous cavern guards, different individuals en route and, finally, Han himself in a mirrored room - all with an authority and skill, with bare hands and nunchuka, which demands repeated viewing.During his fights Lee frequently demonstrates the previously described 'emotional content' of his martial philosophy: a mental posture which manifests itself as a calm self-collection, concentrated into cold fury for victory. On the point of dispatching O'Hara, for instance, Lee ruminates on his immediate aggression with an intense self absorption, killing his sister's murderer through a contemplation of inner pain almost impossible to describe. Later, as the ensuing melee swirls around Lee, the camera zooms again on its hero: typically, he is calm, perfectly focussed. It is during moments like this, full of vengeful rectitude, that the actor provides overwhelming confirmation of star status.",

Enter the Dragon may have marked Bruce Lee's international debut to audiences worldwide, however following his untimely death aged 32 in 1973 he was immortalised as a martial arts legend.Enter the Dragon focuses on Lee (Bruce Lee), a Shaolin martial artist from Hong Kong who is recruited by a British intelligence agent named Braithwaite (Geoffrey Weeks) to investigate a secretive martial arts tournament hosted by reclusive billionaire Han (Shih Kien) who has also fallen under suspicion due to a drug trafficking and prostitution ring that is also operating on the island. It also becomes personal for Lee when he learns that his sister was killed by Han's personal bodyguard Oharra (Robert Wall) some time ago. Also entering the secretive tournament is Roper (John Saxon) who is being pursued by the Mafia after falling into a large gambling debt, and Williams (Jim Kelly) who is on the run from police after falling afoul of two racist police officers who accost him and Williams manages to get the upper hand and successfully defends himself and steals their patrol car. It is a deadly tournament that Lee, Roper and Williams will enter and fight to survive, in the hope of making it out alive.Bolo Yeung made an impressionable international debut in Enter the Dragon which saw him pop up sparingly in other movies such as Bloodsport (1988) and Double Impact (1991). Keep an eye out for Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung in small roles.A lot of movies owe a gratitude of debt to Enter the Dragon. Without Bruce Lee's spectacular prowess on display in this iconic classic, you wouldn't see stars such as Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren, Steven Seagal, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Chuck Norris, Wesley Snipes and Bruce Lee's son Brandon Lee paving their own way through Hollywood throughout the past four decades.There will never be another movie like Enter the Dragon and there will never be anyone like Bruce Lee.

I sure didn't. Just pointing out the obvious things that anyone would find if those chose to watch this with a critical thinking mind, which you would easily spot the problems straight away. But the movie dose deliver on one thing and that's the punch, with it's flawless Martial art fight scenes. This is a very enjoyable movie with Bruce Lee showing off his awesomeness in his last ever film.Without a doubt, the best part of this movie is the fight scenes and I know it's quite obvious to say that, but the fights are the highlight of the film. I felt every hit, punch, kick and smack in all the fight scenes and it's all by the power of Bruce Lee himself. It's glorious to watch and it's by far the best on screen fight scene from any movie I've seen, I mean the amount of detail that Lee puts in his fights are just extraordinary. There's no quick cuts or shaky cam used in those scenes, as it was all naturally filmed. I would go that far and say it's true art *like the title* \"Martial arts.\"This movie doesn't have the most intriguing story, as it's more of a prop itself to hang up in the background so we can get to the real juice stuff. So people can't say it doesn't have a story because it dose, but it's too silly and hasn't got anything remotely interesting that can grab my interest on what's going on. It's also a slow burn at the start, as it takes awhile to get where it needs to go, but it's worth the wait.The acting was pretty bad, as I notice countless times that some of the actors have no emotional on their face when there's scenes that's suppose to be intense or somewhat funny. The editing is really off as well and it's mostly to do with it's weird cuts that comes out of nowhere that feels out of place.Overall Enter the Dragon is a very enjoyable movie with plenty of fun to be have. But what really sucks is that this is the final film we will ever see of the unique, extreme, but talented, Bruce Lee. The legacy will live on.",

The untimely death of Bruce Lee only adds to the mystique that the film exudes, but in truth the film is actually in structure, very poor, so i honestly say the only reason to sit thru this soggy plotted piece is to see the greatest martial artist of all time do his stuff, and thankfully he delivers gold dust for sure.

He's also working undercover for the British government trying to bring down the man behind the fight who is also selling heroin. It's no secret that this film has very little plot, questionable acting, lousy dialogue and no character development but what it lacks in those departments it makes up double that in terms of execution and pure action. This is one of the most memorable looking films from the decade as the visuals in the film are excellent as is the cinematography. I was really caught off guard by how beautiful this film was to look out. All of the fight sequences look incredibly well but so do the scenes where there isn't any fighting. The opening party sequence when everyone is on the island comes to mind as it's filmed perfectly but also because the colors are so vivid that you can't help but get caught up in it. The music score is another major plus as it perfectly fits the mood of the film and makes one really start to dig all the action going on. As for Lee, there's a reason he's a legend and it's easy to see why with this movie. The fighting sequences are all rather breath taking especially considering how much imagination went into them. Just when you thought nothing could top some of the single matches we get an incredible sequence where dozens of fights break out. When Lee finally meets the top guy, the fight in the mirrors is excellent and really packs an incredible punch. John Saxon turns in a good supporting performance and Jim Kelly is fun to watch as well. Fans of the genre are certainly going to eat this film up but those who normally wouldn't watch this type of film will probably be drawn into it as well. Lee was a mighty figure that you can't take your eyes off no matter if he's fighting or just standing still waiting to attack.

Throughout the movie they get into numerous fights and manage to take down Han's empire.The movie has some excellently choreographed fight scenes and exceptional acting on Lee's part. What detracts from the movie's glory however is the miscast John Saxon as Roper. He wasn't right for the role and you could tell he only had minimal skills. While I would love to give this 10/10, I just can't. Saxon is mainly what detracts from it but the final fight with Han was disappointing as well.Stiil, despite all it's flaws it is a must see for any avid Martial Artist.",

            "content": "Probably the biggest Martial Arts movie ever made at the time. But many will most definitely hail it as the turning point when Martial Art Cinema began to dominate in the West, and show the action genre a whole new approach to choreography.Who isn't a Bruce Lee fan? The guy was a living superman that could do 50 chin ups with one arm, throw rice in the air and catch them with chopsticks and many more physical feats too insane to count. The film itself featured every type of Martial Art at the time, unfortunately the corny dialogue is a massive detriment as well as a necessity. Regardless, all the dojo training and set pieces help bring a sense of fantasy and reality. Everyone seems to know some form of fighting style, and Bruce being the master he is dominates all. Bruce Lee's accent has been brought up for debate here and there, and whether you laugh you're arse off or not when Lee is screaming it's no doubt seeing him destroy everything in his path is pretty satisfying.The finale is the highlight of the movie. From nunchucks, fight scenes (See if you can spot Jackie Chan) taking place in caves and a room of mirrors with a guy wearing a glove what looks like it was made from a cereal box and knife blades. All of it in one word is \"unforgettable\".Final Verdict: Bruce Lee's swan song is influential as well as timeless. 8/10.",

            "content": "The 1973 film ENTER THE DRAGON was the first Hollywood kung fu film, placing the then little-known Bruce Lee among American actors and featuring a plot of international proportions.Of course, the Hong Kong roots of the genre still hold. The maniacal supervillain Han (Shih Kien) is murdering young women on his private island. When Han organizes an international martial arts tournament, Lee is sent by the Hong Kong government to bust Han's operation. He is joined by American businessman Roper (John Saxon), hoping to get some money to pay off mafia debts, and black activist Williams (Jim Kelly), who just seeks victory and looking good.There's a great deal of humour in the story, beyond the traditional incompetent henchmen and improbably deft martial arts. I can't imagine that the film-makers did not intend that the viewer take the supervillain's tropes seriously. When Han strokes his cat while plotting his schemes, or when he gives one character a tour of his entire criminal enterprise before asking him to join them, we can't help but chuckle at this borrowings from James Bond. The film works well as mindless entertainment.Nonetheless, the film-makers succeeded in making a film that was more than a simple action outing. Two scenes made ENTER THE DRAGON a classic of cinema. In a scene where Bruce Lee wields nunchaku we are treated to one of the finest documents of athletic prowess, testimony that Lee was not just a simple action star but a great sportsman. The climax of the film, where Lee duels with Han in a hall of mirrors, is rich in symbolism and elegantly filmed, coming to influence many films since. And I personally, a recent visitor to Hong Kong and one passionately interested in the area, enjoyed seeing how Kowloon and Hong Kong Island looked before the boom era.I had a good time watching ENTER THE DRAGON and recommend to any who might be intrigued by a kung fu film that transcends its genre to some degree.",

            "content": "Great legends in films are those that don't make many films, but they all have an impact on the whole world, and the great martial artist in the world certainly did that with this most recommended action film. Basically Shaolin Temple member Lee (Bruce Lee) is visited by British law officer Braithwaite (Geoffrey Weeks) to be hired, on behalf of an agency, to investigate a tournament hosted by Han (Kien Shih). He arrives on the island, and also entering the martial arts tournament are Vietnam buddies Roper (John Saxon) and Williams (introducing Jim Kelly). Lee isn't just doing what he hired to, he also wants vengeance by finding the man responsible for making his sister commit suicide rather than face him killing her. The other two men also have their reasons for coming along, Roper is on the run from the Mafia due to gambling debts, and Williams is being harassed by cops. It turns out that Han has indeed got something else going on at the tournament grounds, he has an opium manufacturing place, is white slave trading, and possibly creating prostitution as well. So when it comes to it, Lee is determined to put a stop to it, and fight many guards and henchmen before fighting for his life with the handless foe. Han has a selection of replacement hands to do battle with Lee, including knives and daggers, but a well-trained and very skilled Lee easily defeats the villain with the help of a spear. Also starring Robert Wall as Oharra, Ahna Capri as Tania, Angela Mao Ying as Su Lin, Betty Chung as Mei Ling, Yang Sze/Bolo Yeung as Bolo and Peter Archer as Parsons. The James Bond style storyline is reasonably interesting at times, but I was much more interested in the marvellous fight sequences created by Lee with his signature high-pitched screams and high kicks. Unfortunately the best fight sequences come in after about fifty to sixty minutes, not what I remember from the last I watched the film, but I guess it doesn't matter too much, it is a great martial arts adventure. This was the final film Lee completed before his mysterious death, three of four films as the leading star, no other kung fu star is likely to reach the level that he did. Bruce Lee was number 49 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and the film was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!",

            "content": "\"It's the art of fighting, without fighting,\" so says Bruce Lee when asked in this movie what style he uses. Philosophically speaking this has tremendous resonance, but on a somewhat more grounded level it's a big fat lie because Enter the Dragon is packed to the rafters with fighting, lots and lots of fighting with Lee normally at the centre of it. As his first (and only) truly transnational film it is an undisputed classic and arguably the greatest martial arts movie ever made and stands as a fitting tribute to the iconic star. But even if you ignore the fact that Lee sadly passed away mere weeks after shooting finished and before the premiere even aired, Enter the Dragon is still a gloriously entertaining movie despite the occasional moment of cheese.Part spy thriller, part blaxploitation piece and all chop-socky, Kung Fu goodness, the film revolves around a tournament on the island of Mr Han. No, not the Linkin Park DJ, but a Dr No style supervillain with a metal hand who is looking to recruit new members to his international drug and prostitution ring. Cue Lee as a respected Shaolin master sent by the British secret service to infiltrate the organisation and find sufficient evidence to arrest him. Only unlike Lee's Hong Kong output, this time he's not alone, for he is joined by John Saxon's out of luck playboy and Jim Kelly's effortlessly cool karate expert.Needless to say, the fight scenes are the key attraction here and Lee excels as always. Simply put, he's never been more devastating and his blows burst out with just as much power today as they did back in the seventies. Just check out his duel with Han's bodyguard O'Hara which features one of the most devastating kicks ever caught on camera. If you're still not convinced, try the stand out underground ruck where the Dragon battles his way through legions of expendable henchmen that culminates in him bringing nun-chucks into the fray. The sheer charisma and energy of Bruce resonates through the screen even over thirty years later and is quite compelling to watch.Furthermore, the supporting cast put plenty of effort in too. Jim Kelly's role as Williams brings a sense of hipster groove and nigh on steals the movie. He is hounded by police simply because of his skin colour, but as he marches round the island clad in designer gear and flared trousers, brawling with thugs by day and bedding down with four women by night, he matches Lee's charisma by wearing his character like a glove. Saxon meanwhile is a little less impressive and ironically, his Caucasian playboy seems the most dated of the three despite Kelly's dress style and haircut. However, he still possesses a certain charm and while not as effective as Lee, manages nonetheless to come across as a lethal fighter.But when it comes down to it, Enter the Dragon is a film about images. Lee's narcissism was in full swing by the time this was made and the camera loves him almost as much as he does; his final brawl with Han in the hall of mirrors is packed with self-adoration and the sight of him shirtless and bleeding from his wounds has become the epitome of the martial arts fighter. Occasionally, the weakness of the narrative is all too readily apparent (the story arc concerning Lee's sister is nigh on superfluous) but when you've got Bruce Lee at the top of his game battling a comic book super villain, aided and abetted by a playboy karate champ and a high kicking afro king, you're in for a hell of a ride.",

In \"Enter the Dragon\", he plays Lee, who enters a contest on an island where reclusive kingpin Han (Kien Shih) is running a bunch of illicit operations. Lee is not only spying on Han; this is a case of revenge, as Han was responsible for the death of Lee's sister. The movie is mostly an excuse to show off Bruce Lee, but believe you me, there's plenty to show off. Whether it's the scene where he defeats all the guards, the scene where he battles bad-ass Bolo, or the final showdown with Han, Bruce Lee always has something to show for himself. Americans John Saxon and Jim Kelly provide some neat support as financially strapped Roper and doesn't-take-crap-from-anyone Williams, respectively.*By using this name, I do not mean to speak negatively of Grace Kelly.

It is the best martial arts tournament from the 70's a powerful film! Enter the Dragon is my number 1 Bruce Lee film, it is my childhood film I grew up with it. This is my movie, I love, love this film to death I love it. Enter the Dragon and Bloodsport (1988) are the only best martial arts tournament movies of all time! Enter the dragon is the best martial arts movie from Bruce Lee, it was his final film before, he past away at age 32 I really miss the legend.The films stars: Bruce Lee, John Saxon, Jim Kelly, Betty Chung, Robert Wall, Shih Kien and Bolo Yeung.Enter the Dragon (1973) is my second personal favorite martial arts tournament film with Bloodsport. I am fan of Bruce Lee and Bruce Lee is the best martial artist expert ever. His kicks are fast with speed and un touchable. The best memorable sequence in the movie, is in which Oharra (Robert Wall) throws a board in the air and smashes it with his fist and Bruce Lee says: \"Boards don't hit back.\" The fight between those two guys Oharra and Lee is amazing in the film. It was excellent in which Bruce Lee jumps with his leg and kicks Oharra so hard with one flying kick in his stomach so fast that Oharra fly's away and knocks down three guys behind his back, best martial arts sequence in the film ever. Bruce Lee really hit Jackie Chan on his head and really hurt him. Now days I don't see any martial arts tournament movies like this one anymore, they are just lousy lazy CGI effect movies.The plot is about a kung fu expert Lee (Bruce Lee) who agrees to go undercover for an agency on a private island owned from an ex Shaolin master, who holds a martial arts tournament every 3 years.The fights, the stunts are realistic, they are for real, no wires, no CGI, no stunt doubles just real fights, real actions. Everything is done practical and for real. Bruce Lee really did hit his opponents. His best weapon was using nunchakus. Bruce lee Vs Han (Kien Shih) was the best fight sequence in the movie ever! John Saxon is Roper from A Nightmare on Elm Street in this movie who becomes Lee's friend and fights Bolo Yeung on the end of the film. Jim Kelly is Williams from Black Belt Jones in this movie he is Roper's friend. His best scene is in the movie in which he fights Han's guards off. Best lines ever: \"Man, you come right out of a comic book.\" He fights off with Han that was excellent fight sequence. Great music score from Lalo Schifrin one of the best 70's Kung Fu martial arts films of all time.Jean-Claude Van Damme, Bruce Lee and Bolo Yeung are to me the best martial arts experts, I love those three guys. Bolo Yeung did work on movie sets with both two martial arts experts Jean-Claude Van Damme and Bruce Lee. He was on the set in this film. On filming of this film, Bolo really become close friends with Bruce Lee. Bolo Yeung says nothing but nice things about Bruce Lee. I watched this movie in 1992 when I was a kid, end of school year with all my class mates. My class mate gave us this movie, as a present when we finished first class best memories ever. Bloodsport and Enter the Dragon were my inspiration on martial arts, how to defend my self against bully's. I saw both of the movies in 1992 on VHS tapes, when I was a 8 year old kid. Jean-Claude Van Damme is my number 1 favorite action star who also says nothing, but nice things about Bruce Lee, Bruce was also Van Damme's inspiration for studying martial arts.Enter the Dragon (1973) and Bloodsport (1988) are the only best martial arts tournament movies of all time, they are my movies. Bloodsport (1988) with Jean-Claude Van Damme is my number 1 and Enter Dragon is my second personal favorite best martial arts tournament film and my number 1 Bruce Lee film of all time, it is my childhoods film I grew up with it.",

As the contest reveals itself to be a lot more brutal than the food and girls provided would suggest, Lee tries to get past the fa\u00e7ade and find the real thing driving the island.So it was in the seventies, so it is today \u0096 Hollywood lifting styles and ideas from around the world to help freshen up its industry that always looks like all the imagination has been sucked out of most products. Here we see the 'first American produced martial arts film' which will not be a big deal to those of us who are aware that the world of cinema doesn't start and end in America but also will surprise Jimmy Cagney no end, although I suppose you'd hardly call that a martial arts film. The plot here is the usual 'martial arts contest on an island' chestnut that has been used way too many times and just allows a very basic plot to be supported by lots of justified fighting. Here the narrative is as weak as it usually is in this type of thing and only a nice comic tone to the first half makes it more enjoyable than it should have been.The fight scenes are good but often lack imagination and style \u0096 the moves are good but the direction is a bit lacking and it certainly doesn't feel that special any more. Lee is still an impressive fighter to watch \u0096 his body is taut and a marvel in its leanness and he makes the fights worth seeing even if his skills as an actor are a bit lacking. Saxon is better and brings a bit of human comedy to the film, but it is difficult to see both him and Kelly as being a case of the casting covering all bases to make sure that the film appeals to all American races. Of the support cast, there are some terrible ADR jobs but Bolo is a memorable presence even in his small role.Overall this is an enjoyable film but nowhere near as impressive as its reputation would have us believe \u0096 could it be possible that American copies of other films are not the best way of experiencing a style of cinema? Lee is physically impressive and is a good lead with Saxon and Kelly doing well despite the unpleasant feel of racial marketing in their casting. The story is weak and only moments of comic tone stop it being either dull or heavy with pretentious kung fu philosophy. Of course Lee's final film was always going to be memorable but if you are after an actual martial arts film then there are better than this.",

But celebrity does have its temptations and pitfalls and it was a period when drug taking was considered normal in certain spheres.

If it weren't for Bruce Lee who knows where the action genre would be right now. He is always to the extreme and very fierce with his fighting ability especially with his nun-chucks. This film has a pretty descent nun- chuck scene but Bruce Lee's \"Return of the Dragon\" (aka Way of the Dragon) is his best by far. The other two main characters of the movie are an eccentric afro loving karate master Williams (Jim Kelly) and a gambling preppy Roper (John Saxon) who is later known best for playing Nancy's father in \"Nightmare on Elm St.\" They are a representation of us as a society. They try to make it so everyone can relate to the good guys since one is black, one white, and last but not least Asian. It is effective because they all have their unique personalities and everybody brings something to the table. The fighting scenes in this movie were authentic for its time due to the fact that Bruce Lee was also the fighting coordinator. His raw power and confidence is something that you can't fake or act making him more then just an actor but a symbol for something greater. He represents his generation more so then John Travolta strutting his stuff or Sylvester Stallone running up some stairs. Bruce Lee surpasses being just an actor and becomes an ideal. He sets the bar for being as close to perfection then anyone can achieve and that is what makes him so great.4 out of 5 starsCool Factor: Every scene with Bruce LeeLame Factor: Could have had a better villain",

I wasn't expecting much, but right from the start I was somewhat impressed by the philosophical dialogue and story development. One of the best parts of the movie is the character introductions and development. Another thingSome of the fight scenes are awesome during the tourney, and it really feels like it's real fighting. It has some classic parts during the fights. While the movie is simplistic in many ways and has several laughable parts because it's a little cheesy, it's tolerable because what the filmmakers and Lee are trying to do is recognizably noble and surprisingly good. This is a martial arts film with a little more depth than you'd expect. To me, the best part was how it focused on the characters. You do feel like you're rooting for them and know them upon reflection and on multiple watches. This would be a fun movie to have some laughs about too; you can make fun of it, but you also like it at the same time. I'm still not a fan of martial arts films, but if I had to recommend one, I'd recommend this as it passes for mainstream appeal and has some substance behind just action fights.

And nobody flies.John Saxon boxes more than he kicks, but he's always a believable tough guy. Bolo Yeung is as scary as any ten humans. Jim Kelly has great abs, though his best moment comes when he is beaten to death with a metal hand. Kien Shih is a classic, sneering arch-criminal, and does more of his own fighting than your average Blofeld; he is hampered however by a couple of silly prosthetics, one of which looks like a chunk of plywood with a toupee. This movie also has four more breasts than any Bond flick, though they're used as set dressing, not particularly for titillation. Nobody watches a grudge-match martial arts tournament movie for the chicks. Which is one of the reasons I don't watch too many of them.An entirely enjoyable stupid movie, best taken while inebriated. Maybe the best Bruce Lee movie... but then, Bruce Lee movies only ever suck slightly less than any other kung fu movies. Most of which can hardly be called good.

I'm always mixing the two up) culture, which I think are a little dull, too, but I've never really understood their culture. The acting is good, and the characters are well-written and credible. The action is spectacular. Every single scene involving fighting is intense and exciting, but when Lee fights... it's excellent, it's fast as hell, and it's bloody awesome. He is so fast that he could kick the legs out from under you before you even realize that he's going to attack. The final fight between Lee and Shih, the villain, is excellent.

Thats the only thing that spoils this film, it makes me sad to know this was his one and only American made film, he would have made some fantastic movies in the 70's 80's and beyond.

Now I opted to sit down again and watch it yet again, and see if the memories of the movie were as good, or if it was just something build up because of the legendary Bruce Lee.The storyline in \"Enter the Dragon\" was straight forward; a guy's sister was killed and his ancestry tarnished, so he must enter a fighting tournament to redeem himself and his Shaolin master. Sure, sounds like something familiar, doesn't it? Yup, maybe because the plot has been copied by many other martial arts movies along the years since 1973 perhaps...Actually the storyline is actually more of backdrop filler than it was the focal point of the movie. Of course \"Enter the Dragon\" was about the martial arts and about showcasing Bruce Lee's skills. Which he also was given more than enough chance to do, because the movie had a lot of martial arts in it, and I do mean a LOT.It was nice to see Bolo Yeung in the movie. I honestly had fully and completely forgotten that he was in a Bruce Lee movie. So that was a definitely something that was good. And it was also interesting to see the likes of John Saxon in a movie such as this.The movie version I sat down to watch, was unfortunately one that was dubbed. I do loathe dubbed movies, as I believe a movie is best enjoyed in its original language. Especially so when those hired to do the dubbed voices are doing dubious work at their given tasks.All in all, \"Enter the Dragon\" is an entertaining movie, but this was by no means a movie that had a deeper plot or provided the audience with something to think about. This was martial arts, pure and simple.My rating of the movie is a six out of ten stars.",

There is no depth or philosophy here, the story is full of holes and illogicalities and serves only as a background for non-stop action.The acting varies from bad to mediocre. However, most of the characters you see on the screen are not actors. The streets of Hong Kong are not filled with extras, but the film was shot in a real environment.

            "content": "No doubt about it, this is THE most memorable martial arts film of all time. One, the master, Bruce Lee, totally excelled in, even if there are a lot of choreographed moves, it/he still looks ultimately impressive. The film however does have a fair plot. 'Braithwaite' a sort of pseudo-crime agency bigwig, recruits Lee, to bring down a drugs and crime kingpin, 'Han'. Han, of course, 'lives big' as is said in the film, on an island of his own, with an added 'sportsman-like' attitude (or so it seems) in bringing all the martial arts talent into one place for a fighting tournament. This brings Lee into contact with also, some of the real dregs of society - ones that can fight! Roper, (John Saxon) a kind of fair-spirited guy lead by his gambling addiction and running away from it/the trouble he's in and his chum he bumps into, the somewhat rough diamond, but spirited, 'flashy' 'Williams' played by Jim Kelly. The know each other well from their days in 'nam. There are others introduced like 'Parsons' another ne'er-do-well. Braithwaite also has a female agent on the island whom he's not sure is still alive, May Ling.Braithwaite co-erces Lee into doing his bidding in trying to either bring Han down or at least let him get word to Braithwaite and HIS chums to take him down at the right moment. After all, a wily old man, lets Lee know that Han's right-hand man, 'O' Hara' murdered his sister. It's the old revenge trick that gets Lee to finally make his mind up and take Han on for the death of his sister - now it's personal!There are various fights and excellent fight scenes in the tournament. Lee even gets his chance to revenge his sister in killing O'Hara by some martial arts shoot-out, er, 'kick-out'.There's all sorts of entertainment on the island - girls for the likes of Roper and Williams especially, good food, a chance to enter some kick-ass martial arts games and us getting to see them. Lee has found May Ling and they plan to expose Han and alert Braithwaite as May Ling says a lot of girls go missing in Han's sewer of drugs and prostitution.Lee in the meantime, dresses in black, scales and scouts the island for information into Han's den of depravity and degradation. Part of all the 'enjoyment' on the island is to sucker-in the dregs Han's invited to bring some more 'talent' into his little empire. This doesn't run to letting people run around his island. But Williams, even though having been warned, sampling the moonlight after his session with the girlies, gets the blame for Lee doing it. Han announces to all in the tournament courtyard, someone wasn't where they should be but uses this to demonstrate he isn't messing around - he blames his guards for the failure and shows all and sundry through his other henchman 'Bolo' that they'll be summarily executed by kicking, stamping and the breaking of necks etc., of the guards. To emphasise Han knows HE knows Williams was the perpetrator of the spying, (even though it was Lee) he slyly asks Williams if he's shocked, the flash one himself replies: 'Only how sloppy your man works!' (Trying to convince Han he isn't scared of what he's just witnessed). Roper isn't impressed at all and says to his good pal Williams they need to talk about what's happened! Han's marked Williams for death and they have a fight-out, Han with clawed false hand and all, after accusing him of being the 'spy' (when it was Lee anyway). Han now lets Roper, William's good pal, know about his 'operation' letting him know HE knows all about Roper's background and would be a good cadet for him. It looks like Roper may be swayed, but then Han lets him know the price of folly, failure and betrayal - he shows him Williams hanging from the rafters - Roper, sickened, especially by seeing his dead chum rebels.A fight ensues, Lee even does some amazing fighting with all of Han's useless remaining guards (reminds us of all the droids in the later 'earlier' Star Wars serials - I mean what use ARE they all?!?).Lee's locked up, but in James Bond style, he'll always escape - he also lets out various prisoners held in Han's dungeons who will undoubtedly make a massive army to take on Han's guards. (Convenient, eh?!).The summary massive fight ensues in the outdoors, with hundreds of feet and fists flying everywhere, but of course, Lee will take on Han. With a tense bit of fighting near the end, Lee of course, takes Han out. The prisoners who helped have done over Han's men (they would be 'better' than Han's wouldn't they?). An end shot of Lee and Roper giving the thumbs-up to one another and the late arrival of Braithwaite's guys invading Han's island brings the film to a good close.We can always pick holes in this film but on the whole it was massively enjoyable with never a real dull moment. As I've said, with Lee at his best and still with a central plot. The beautiful Ahna Capri (who is killed in the final melee) was Han's head concubine who had a little crush on Roper, lends some glamour. (There's no real love-interest thankfully - May Ling looks a little longingly at Lee but that's about it, as I say, thankfully!). Also, there would be big issues among some with stereotypes (check my heading - from a Chinese person to Lee!) and even Jim Kelly, although hamming it up big time, seems very ''Shaft'-and-medallion-wearing like', but this was also the '70s. Another aspect, dare I say it - EVERYONE AND ANYONE oriental can do martial arts it seems!",

Even though Bruce Lee had made a few good martial films before Enter The Dragon, this was his big break through movie to a main stream audience. It's a Hollywood style big budget movie, its well made with lots of action and fight scenes. Bruce Lee plays \"Lee\" - He is recruited by a British intelligence agent to go undercover and investigate an evil crime lord called Han. Lee enters a big martial arts tournament that Han is hosting on his Island. Lee does some fighting of a day and some investigations during the night. Bruce Lee plays the same type of a character as he did in his other movies quite, respectful and philosophical. Lee is super fit, athletic and very charismatic. Lee's choreographed fight scenes are great, which lead many of a young boy to believe Lee was superman and could really do it all. An interesting fact is Bruce Lee never had a professional fight or entered any combat tournaments as an adult. There are fight scenes in the movie where 50 bad guys patiently wait in turn to fight Bruce Lee. Why they all didn't just rush him at once we will never know! Shortly after this movie was made Bruce Lee died at 32 in July 1973. Unfortunately Lee never got to see the huge success this movie was. Lee would have probably gone on to have a very successful career and been a big star. He left a legacy particularly with this film and Lee is an absolute icon within the martial arts world.",

The fluidity of his motions and Lee's never wasting a single motion in a single frame is something to be cherished, because no one out there today even comes close.  Bruce Lee was one of those rare gems that defined a genre and an era, that while oft copied can never be truly duplicated.If you are a big martial arts fan, then most likely you've already seen this movie - if you haven't then what are you waiting for?

Bruce Lee has been accused of being overbearing and arrogant many times in print, but I wonder if perhaps that is merely well-justified, total self-confidence. All one has to do is take one look in Lee's eyes anytime throughout the film and there is no doubt whatsoever as to what the outcome of almost any fight he would have had would be. The philosophical aspects of the martial arts in the opening scenes (thankfully restored for the 25th anniversary special edition I have) are what help set this film apart from many of it's descendents (why bother with actually thinking about all aspects of martial arts when mindless violence is likely to be enough?). But there are little touchs throughout that seem to ever so subtly follow up those thoughts. This seems especially true with my favorite scene: Lee bows before O'Hara, O'Hara holds out a board and chops it in half with his other hand. Lee makes only one comment: \"Boards...don't hit back.\"It is not a film without flaws. The fight scenes are way too one-sided, especially when one compares with the real workouts Lee puts himself through with \"The Chinese Connection\" (a film that, sadly, is marred by the worst dubbing job ever done in the history of civilization). The plot moves at a leisurely pace that may annoy some (but doesn't me). Finally, watching Lee rack up about 49 years of bad luck in the mirror room is a little on the anti-climatic side. But I can still say with this in mind that this was not only the first stateside martial arts film but the best.",

The film still holds up as an action piece even though at the time it was a lower budget film and some of the cheesy Hong Kong rock cave sets show the limitations the resources the US crew had to deal with at the spartan Hong Kong studio. The fight sequences have a stark, harsh yet balletic quality to them and all of them staged by Lee himself having honed his ability by his previous film experiences. The battle in the heroin plant is the center piece action and Bruce is in top form doing moves that still leaves one in awe of his excellent fighting skill. The co-stars all get their moments to shine, Jim Kelly bringing the macho-kick-shit Black Panther attitude to his character, John Saxon does a fair turn with his fighting all the while keeping his cheap hair piece in check.\nLalo Schifrin score, like so many in the late 60's-70's, is epic and underscores the action perfectly.\nAll in all, there were Chop-soki films before and after Lee, but he was the one who raised the bar making it a legitimate genre.

Many people say this has no plot, but guess what? Many martial arts films don't have a plot. They aren't out to win Oscars. The purpose is to just enjoy them and have a good time.

Set up like a Bond movie with lashings of martial mayhem, our story concerns Shaolin monk Lee (Bruce), sent undercover by British intelligence to infiltrate the deadly island of Han (Sheck Kin), a one-handed drug trafficking meanie holding a brutal martial art tournament on his island every three years. Lee conscripts to take part and soon enough discovers the true horrors of Han's evil mastery. Plot wise the movie's instantly forgettable, and it's probably true to say that without Lee's presence the film would have nose-dived. The support do play it well (Saxon is composed veteran Roper; Kelly is introduced as the dated Williams; Sheck Kin snarls like the best of them and Bolo is just the meanest thing on the planet), but this is Lee's movie through and through: complete with that ice-cool death stare and the legendary mirror finale, Lee has assured Enter the Dragon's longevity for many more years to come and still remains as the genre's crowning achievement.

Needless to say, he had sex appeal and maintained it even when he was in the throes of beating the chi (life force) out of some idiot who believed incorrectly that he could whoop Lee in a fight.

Having boxed as a young man (photos exist of him in action in the ring), he understood something that too many \"martial artists\" don't: force equals mass, times acceleration. Simple physics. Working out BAREHANDED on heavy bags (and sparring with partners using both boxing and grappling gloves and headgear and sometimes even body armor), Lee knew whereof he spoke. This was no \"paper tiger.\" Bob Wall, himself a middleweight martial arts champion, has recounted seeing Bruce Lee accept challenges on movie sets and dispensing with his opponent(s) in short order. [There are also photos of one such encounter.] If that's not \"proof\" enough, ask Joe Lewis, the very first full-contact heavyweight karate champion of the world: he has cited Bruce Lee's input as part of the reason his world-renowned sidekick is so renowned. [And one need only watch one of Lewis's fights to see WHY his sidekick is so world-renowned...]As for ENTER THE DRAGON: it's easily the greatest film of its genre, and will remain so. [Look at it this way: Bruce Lee takes out both Sammo Hung- in the opening fight scene- and Jackie Chan- in the tunnel- in one movie!] (And, yes, I'm well aware that this is CHOREOGRAPHY. We are, after all, talking about a MOVIE...) Robert Clouse rose to the occasion, his reach exceeding his grasp thanks, in part, to strong producers and a charismatic star. Storywise, the film is as sound as anything else you're likely to see; there are no gaping holes in the plot. The cinematography is superb, as is Lalo Schifrin's stirring score. A complete package.",

How fitting that his last film is the one most people remember him by and it is this film that spawned a whole new genre in Hollywood made films.The film itself is not oscar material and almost has a B-movie quality to it. Violence, nudity, almost cheesy dialogue...all thats needed is some monster running around killing hot babes (sorry, trailed off a bit). Despite this, we have some fine quality fight scenes especially the Lee/Wall and Saxon/Yeung fights. We also have a story that has been the standard for all future Martial Arts films that have a tournament as its main focus.  Don't believe me? Look at THE QUEST or BLOODSPORT or MORTAL KOMBAT (just to name a few), compare them with ENTER THE DRAGON and you will find an uncanny resemblance they have with ENTER THE DRAGON.Lee was as usual superb. Cold and calculating, this master of the Martial Arts knows how to kick some serious behind while keeping a sense of humor (you read right).  Saxon was excellent as well, although Lee was a better fighter, Saxon was the better actor.  This film also introduced the film world to Jim Kelly who portrayed the arrogant Williams. Kelly was the happy medium between Lee's incredible fighting skills and Saxon's excellent acting. Kelly even said my favorite line the film. When Williams (Kelly) was asked why he wouldn't notice being defeated he replied, \"I'll be too busy looking good.\"A must see for any martial arts film goer or any action movie buff.

Almost every young man in American regarded him as their idol in my father's age. This movie also can make us more familiar with martial arts, especially the core of it - moves come from the heart, no fight beat fight.There will be no surprise for you in plots if you are a fan of 007 series. Like the other sort of mission pictures, Enter The Dragon also tells about an agent destroying a criminal den. The only difference is no guns can be seen in this film, instead of which it is martial arts from the beginning to the end.The clean and quick fight of Bruce Lee make me excited, I can't help myself to watch the other Bruce Lee's master pieces.",

            "review_title": "It's all about Bruce",
            "content": "For years I made it a point to avoid all Bruce Lee movies.  As an Asian-American male growing up in white suburban America in the 70s and 80s, it made me cringe every time I saw someone do a mocking impression (which unfortunately was quite often) of the stereotypical kung fu movie, (i.e. lips moving out of synch with dubbed dialogue, loud snap sounds made when punching or kicking, old men spouting platitudes in a heavy accent).  I don't think it's a stretch to say that for many Americans these silly characteristics comprised their idea of \"Asian culture\", which was invariably associated with one Asian-American in particular: Bruce Lee.  I thought I could only be cool if I disassociated myself from this corny \"kung fu culture\".  Of course, my mistake was believing these stereotypes without looking at the actual evidence.  Finally a few years ago after immensely enjoying \"Dragon: the Bruce Lee Story\", I decided to sit down and actually watch Bruce Lee's movies, starting with what's generally acknowledged as his best film, \"Enter the Dragon\".Now, I will admit that a lot of martial arts flicks are pretty corny by American standards, and \"Enter the Dragon\" is not exactly immune from this. Although the film was made in English, some characters' voices are obviously overdubbed to eliminate their accents.  Most notable is during the opening dialogue Bruce Lee has with an old Shaolin priest (a scene not in the original theatrical cut, but which was restored for the 25th anniversary edition)--the priest sounds like a commercial voiceover.  The dubbing for Han is much better, as the dubbing was done by a Chinese actor with a rich but very clear accent.  And sure enough every punch and kick is accentuated by what sounds like someone snapping a very wet towel.  But these are just the surface details and are no more absurd than many Hollywoodisms in American films.  The reason this movie is a cut above the rest is Bruce Lee. Seeing a still picture of him doesn't properly express the quiet but fiery magnetism that is immediately evident the first time he's on screen.  In addition to being every bit the kick-ass fighter his reputation suggests, he combines it with a philosophical and intellectual outlook on life which translates well in this film, both in words and actions.  Lee attained a somewhat mythical status after dying before this film was released, but his performance leaves no doubt that he would have attained it anyway.It wasn't until recently, when Jackie Chan flicks started making it over here on video and then in theaters, that watching martial arts flicks were considered anything more than a nerdy hobby, like playing Dungeons & Dragons or listening to Rush.  It's arguable whether Bruce Lee could've done it 20 years earlier in the 70s had he continued his own brand of martial arts movies --- Chan's movies are more like self-effacing daredevil acts as opposed to Lee's philosophical fisticuffs.  Instead we got a flood of inferior knock-off pictures starring Bruce Le, Li, Lei, etc. which only added fuel to the fire.  Time has also brought enlightment, imho, for Americans to a more well-rounded perspective of Asian culture.In any case, anyone interested in Bruce Lee or martial arts films in the slightest owe it to themselves to see the man himself in action, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",

This was Bruce Lee's fourth film and the film that was to break the ice with becoming a big star in Hollywood.  Sadly, he didn't live long to get the opportunities in film that he deserved after years of hard work.  If Bruce Lee had lived than he would be the biggest star in Hollywood(bigger than Mel Gibson and Arnold combined) today.\nMany people like Chuck Norris, Steven Seagal, Jean Clude Van Damme, Jackie Chan owe their careers to Bruce Lee and this movie because they might not be in the same situation they got into were this film never made.  Enter the Dragon(1973) was directed by average film maker Robert Clouse whose only other decent film he did was the Jackie Chan film, The Big Brawl(1980).  The plot is loosely lifted from Dr. No(1962).  Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon(1973) is finally given the chance to fully feature his philosophies of Martial arts.\nBruce Lee just with his charismatic and spellbound presence proved to many people that he could carry a film on his back.  Features cameos by future big names such as Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Ching Ying Lam(Mr. Vampire), and Yuen Biao.  John Saxon has had the privilege of working with people like Mario Bava, Don Siegal, Bruce Lee, David Cronenberg, Dario Argento, and Wes Craven.  Bolo Yeung is one of the few people to do a film with both Bruce Lee and son, Brandon Lee.\nThe opening scene is symbolic because in a way it would mean the passing of the baton between Bruce Lee to Sammo Hung.  The fight scenes during the last thirty minutes are breathless.  Bruce Lee is in my opinion was the greatest Martial artist ever to grace the big screen.  Enter the Dragon is also filled with Bruce Lee humor for he was someone who loved to play practical jokes on people.",

Actually, when CBS-Fox released a \"Bruce Lee Boxed Set\" of four movies a few years back, I was surprised that this particular title wasn't included.  Shame on them!This film is rather short on plot, and the acting leaves some to be desired. However, the main attractions behind this film are the martial arts sequences, and they certainly won't disappoint.  This film has the best martial arts action in the history of cinema.Bruce Lee is amazing in this movie, and there are even a couple of those famous \"close-up\" shots of his face after obliterating an opponent with some fantastic move or another, along with that howl of his that just kind of tapers off very slowly along with the slow-motion action of the sequence. If you are a Bruce Lee fan, or a fan of martial arts in general, you will know what I'm talking about.  Nobody did it better than Bruce.John Saxon and Jim Kelly are pretty good here also, and Bolo Yeung can also be seen in this movie, his first major motion picture.  (He is credited as Yang Sze here.)  Actually, some people don't know that Yeung was a student of Lee's.  As well, this movie contains an uncredited entrance by Jackie Chan.  IMDb lists Jackie as being an extra in the finale of the movie, but I believe he is also seen in the beginning of the film when Lee's sister is being attacked by Oharra and his gang of malcontents.  (I think he is the one that Lee's sister first defends herself against.)  Watch closely... I'm not totally sure it's him, but it sure looks like him.Overall, if you are a Bruce Lee fan, or a martial arts fan, or just adore fabulous action sequences, be sure and get this movie.  It has recently been re-released for the 25th Anniversary of the movie, and that particular version is the one you should see.  I was a bit bothered by the fact that the sound still doesn't seem the best, there are some parts that actually seem to be dubbed, even when english words are being spoken.

Game of Death also gives us some insight ... it's just a shame, a big shame.Many great fight scenes, but also looks into Bruces mindset - like when he schools a student of his. It might feel like he's being too rude to him, but he's teaching him - with a bit of tough love. Helping him if possible. There is also the scene on the boat - \"the art of fighting without fighting\". It may sound like a plattitude and the way the scene plays out may not work entirely, but it is fun to watch and it gives you the mindset he is in.One of the biggest surprises is John Saxon, who really comes off as quite the fighter. I don't think many expected this from him - even with Bruce as mentor or teacher or whatever. Then you have the end fight (boss fight) ... which is quite incredible. The way it was shot, the way it was staged ... really inventive and really well made.So a classic - there is a version with some added material (not much), that is on the Criterion Collection.

Some parts turned into borderline blaxploitation, but this was the 70s, so I guess that is pretty normal. I wish he had a bigger role, as I actually enjoyed Kelly more than Lee or Saxon.I would be hard-pressed to call this the greatest martial arts film of all time. But I would be even more hard-pressed to name one that is superior. I do think the fighting does not play as big of a role as it should. Some modern Donnie Yen movies (the \"Ip Man\" series, for example) consist of much more interesting conflicts... but, hey, this was still fun.The film achieved notoriety for being Bruce Lee's final picture, and it also introduced a young Jackie Chan. The circle remains unbroken. And, I must give a shout-out to the late Robert Clouse, the director, who was born in Wisconsin...",

Older now, i can see the flaws in this, but they don't take anything away from my enjoyment of the movie. The fighting is some of the best filmed: one of Bruce's kicks was too fast for the camera, and if you've seen the movie you'll know which one.The plot sees Lee (Lee) going undercover in an island martial arts tournament to get proof of the owner Han's involvement in drugs, prostitution and murder, while taking revenge on his sister's death-caused by Han's men. With him comes Roper, running from the mob, and William's, running from the law. The contest begins, Lee investigates, and in the end a full scale battle breaks out between Han's men and the contestants. Again the ending is mysterious as with all Lee's films, and tragically as with his own life. The four main leads are all excellent, racial issues are explored by Lee (but most critics are too blind to see this and dismiss his films as mere punch and fly-kick flicks): The guy on the boat who Lee quickly deals with? Lee's philosophising also is strong throughout the film. Then again, if you only want classic Hong Kong action, this is probably the most famous film, and one of the best. 8 out of 10",

The guy playing the villain, Hahn, is incredible, he does not talk that much and does not even look that intimidating, so when he does fight it is all the more surprising. John Saxson and Jim Kelly are great in their roles, you even see that they both have different yet equally interesting backstories. However, I would have liked to have seen more of them together, learned more about what made them such good friends as they are supposed to be friends in the film.To be honest, that is probably my only problem with the film and it is very minor. You do still grow to care about all the characters, there is a death midway through the film that I was not expecting and I was quite upset about. The martial arts in this film is incredible, in fact it was one of the reasons I became interested in taking martial arts classes.It's fun, intense, funny at times, Enter the Dragon is, without a doubt, one of the greatest films of all time.",

            "content": "\"A kung-fu master (Lee) is asked by the Hong Kong government to infiltrate a martial arts tournament, which is actually a front for drug smuggling. He agrees after he finds out that the gang members killed his sister. During the tournament, he meets up with a gambler down on his luck (Saxon) and a black karate master (Kelly), who reluctantly end up aiding Lee. A lot of people call this one of the best (if not the best) martial arts film of all time. I like the movie, but I wouldn't go that far. While it does stand above many other films, Enter the Dragon is just lacking that certain something. The movie loses itself in subplots with the Saxon and Kelly characters -- does anyone actually believe John Saxon could kick Bolo Yeung's ass? I suspect the only reason so much emphasis was put on these characters was to give the movie more \"crossover\" appeal (just think of the pairing of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in Rush Hour). There's also a lot of unnecessary nudity; I have nothing against nudity, it's just that the scenes that involve it here grind the movie to a halt. Finally, the \"revenge for a family member\" plot was tired even back in the '70's. This wouldn't be such a bad thing, but the script is so horrible and Clouse seems to be sleepwalking as director, it comes off as really no better than those countless \"Kung-Fu Theatre\" movies (at least in the storytelling department).However, in the action department, Enter the Dragon certainly delivers. Warner Bros. wisely decided to let Lee direct all the fight sequences, and they're outstanding. Every time I start to bitch about the things stated above, once I see Lee beating the hell out of everyone, I remember why I like the movie. The final brawl is a true classic which very few films have matched since then. On the acting side, Lee is also great; his stern, dignified performance stands out, especially when compared with other martial arts \"actors\" like Van Damme. He really did have a lot of talent in both realms of fighting and acting, and Enter the Dragon showcases them. So, while it's not a perfect movie, Enter the Dragon is a fitting testament to Lee's legacy.RATING: 8A couple of side notes...For its' 25th anniversary, Enter the Dragon was reissued. If you haven't seen this version yet, I highly recommend you do so. The picture is much clearer, and the soundtrack is finally in stereo (gotta love that funky theme). This \"special edition\" also includes the original trailer, a behind-the-scenes documentary and interviews with Lee and his widow, Linda. There are also a couple of added scenes cut from the US version. This was the first major US/HK co-production ever and it paved the way for trade between the two countries (both in films and personnel). If you look fast, you can see a young Jackie Chan in the ending fight sequence in the drug lab. Sammo Hung is the guy Lee fights at the beginning of the film. The film was banned in several countries including Finland and Sweden upon its release, and is still heavily censored in England (which prohibits the showing of nunchakus). Yang Sze changed his stage name to \"Bolo Yeung\" after his character became popular. He still uses the name to this day. This was the final film Bruce Lee worked on before his death in 1973. He died before the movie's US premiere and would never see how popular the movie (and he) would become.\"",

Bruce Lee has many other great films other than EtD, the second best would have to be 'Return of the Dragon', which Lee directed and wrote. It features the most classic fight in movies between Lee and fellow martial artist Chuck Norris. But by far, Lee's best performance came in 'Marlow', a James Garner dud. His presence in this film made it all worth while. EtD though has what all action and martial arts fans could want from a film, and more.

I'm here to give you a little taste of reality: Enter The Dragon is a mediocre film with excellent fight sequences, and great fights do not a great movie make.The film's main achilles heel is its acting.  In short, it sucks.  The only credible performances are given by John Saxon as Roper, Geoffrey Weeks as Braithwaite, and Betty Chung as Lee's undercover contact on Han's island.Shih Kien (Han) was so unintelligible that Keye Luke of the old Charlie Chan films had to dub all of Kien's lines; every time Jim Kelly (Williams) and Peter Archer (Parsons, the Aussie bully on the boat) open their mouths, you have to fight with yourself to keep from laughing.  Bolo grunts inarticulately a couple of times, and Bob Wall (O'Hara) who has only one line in the entire movie (\"You must attend the morning ritual in uniform\") doesn't deliver it convincingly.  And even the Great One Himself comes off sounding pretty weak.  At times his Chinese accent is so thick, he's difficult to understand, and  he gives the movie's most famous line (\"Boards...don't hit back.\") a truly bizarre reading.  This is the price that martial art movies continually pay for casting fighters instead of actors in prominent roles.  Jim Kelly is no more capable of giving a decent acting performance than Tom Hanks is capable of acquitting himself respectably in a kickboxing match.The fight choreography is entertaining for the most part, although the basement sequence and the final fight with Han both drag on longer than they need to.  There are also inconsistencies: whenever he fights Han's guards (typical lame, cannon-fodder action-movie henchmen), Lee knocks out each man with a single blow, but all that one-punch knockout power mysteriously vanishes when he fights Han and O'Hara.The best grade I can give Enter The Dragon is 5 out of 10.",

The movie has many -- one on one, one on three, one on many, fighters grabbing and using, and defending against, different sets of weapons. But no firearms. Bruce does most of his fighting shirtless and while I like men with a little more meat on their bones his athleticism is simply awesome.That said, the movie is really grade B so don't expect anything more.

It was the first of its kind produced by an American studio, which actually makes its quality even more impressive. It kicked off the 'Kung fu craze' of the seventies and its influence is unmissable still to this day. It's easy to see why it's so fondly remembered. The final third, marked by a famously fantastic sequence in which Lee takes on around fifty foes in quick succession, is incredibly entertaining. It's also home to some iconic imagery and quotes. This is where the martial arts really shine through, even though they've been on display periodically throughout the piece. The choreography is slower than some later fare but it's just as, if not more, impactful; it focuses on technique, timing and, in some cases, brutality. It often uses the unique, perhaps seemingly counter-intuitive technique of consistently keeping Lee in frame. This means his opponents, essentially, all come from off screen, rushing in for a brief (attempt at an) attack before being put down just as swiftly. However, the incredibly long takes, stylish long-lens zooms and easy-to-read choreography make for a clarity of action seldom seen since and a sense of isolation for our powerful but out-numbered hero. When it ends, this final movement is what you remember most. It leaves you feeling energised, with a smile on your face. The flick isn't perfect, though. It's actually rather slow, setting up its premise pretty promptly but spending too much time with secondary characters to feel properly pacy. It's never exactly boring but almost seems as though it could have been tightened up a bit. The story, at large, isn't the most compelling either, being rather vague and clearly just an 'excuse' - if you will - for the picture's fight-sequences (and, to an extent, philosophy). Having said that, the characters are all interesting enough, if a little undefined, and the setting is fairly enigmatic. It's not like the first half dampens the feature's overall effect, either. It's enjoyable, well-crafted and iconic. The fight scenes really are terrific. 7/10",

I remember watching the Kung Fu TV series starring David Carradine but was too young to get into the cinema to see any of Bruce Lee's films. This of course was the biggest and most successful of them all, the sadness being of course that Lee didn't live to see the worldwide success that the movie became.To be fair, the film plays like a martial-arts James Bond caper with Lee as the secret agent hired by a plummy-voiced English spymaster to bring down the Blofeld-like cat-stroking master-villain Han in his Hong Kong back-yard as well as avenging the death of his sister, driven to hari-kiri by a pursuing gang of local hoodlums and their Western boss. His cover is attending a sort of last-man-standing martial arts tournament set up by Han whose real motive in so doing is to recruit more members to his criminal sect. Also in it to win it are John Saxon and Jim Kelly, both martial arts experts themselves, the former a white devil-may-care shyster-gambler on the run from the mob and the latter a stereotypical jive-talking, sex-machine black guy on the run from racist cops he's had the temerity to answer back to.Sure the story is clich\u00e9d, right down to the mirrored conclusion lifted straight from \"The Lady From Shanghai\", the movie is far from perfectly dubbed, the acting is a bit wooden in places and Han is hardly the most dastardly villain you'll ever meet, but it's all about Lee, as nimble as a cat but as sharp as a cobra in set-piece after set-piece of high-kicking karate-chopping action. At what must have been the height of his physical condition one can only imagine the greater success which would have surely awaited him following this film's huge success which I'm positive it would have achieved even without the commercial boost, if that's the right word, from the unexpected death on release of its main star. In particular, his mastery of the nanchukkas has to be seen to be believed.Throw in another scintillating Lalo Schifrin soundtrack and you have a terrific action movie built around an exciting and charismatic star who sadly didn't get to see its great success which would surely have taken him into the superstar bracket.",

Number 1, there's not enough Lee fighting, the fight with Roper and Bowlo should've been Lee and Bowlo. There's too many other fights with the other guys it's not with Bruce Lee. I mean come on, they should've had more fights with Lee, there's only three fights with lee. The one against Bob Wall, the one after Roper beat up Bowlo, then the one against Han. The rest are just him fighting, but I don't exactly consider them much as \"fights\" because it's just him sneaking around and encountering a bodyguard and then just beating him up with a couple punches to get him out of the way. Other than all that, I love the movie because of its quality, and Bruce speaking English was great because I hate the ones where his voice has to be dubbed.",

In his calmer moments he doles out some philosophy as well, and he makes for a pretty compelling action hero. How incredibly sad is it that he died tragically at 32, a month before this was released.The film shamelessly lifts the story line from the James Bond series, with an evil villain out on an island and stroking a cat no less, but Lee himself was the real deal. There are some groan-worthy moments like the women being distributed to the fighters and the African-American guy taking four (not more, because as he says, he's a little tired), but the film also has some pretty cool moments showing poverty (\"Ghettoes are the same all over the world\") and an incredibly relevant moment showing racist policemen abusing their power. And, while Lee was an important figure to Asians at a time when there were a lot of protests in Hong Kong against British rule, the race and gender of the fighters in the film is shown to be unimportant, just as it was to Lee in real life. That was a pretty cool sequence in front of all the mirrors at the end too.",

            "content": "At the time of its release \"Enter the Dragon\" had to be considered the greatest American made martial arts movie of all time. Guess what, after more than thirty years later, its still the greatest. Had Lee lived to complete \"Game of Death\", it may have surpassed \"Enter the Dragon\" as his best film. However, by the time of its release, some six years or so after Lee's death, 1978's \"Game of Death\" had been transformed into a pieced together kung fu mess that probably should never have been released. I'm sure Lee would have considered it a disgrace. In \"Enter the Dragon\" Lee plays a martial arts expert who enters a martial arts contest located on a secluded island to spy on the events' creator, a ruthless crime lord named Han, whose hideaway is inside this island fortress. Han's real purpose for the contest is to recruit more criminals for his evil empire. Mr. Han is not only a drug dealer, but also kills or has people killed without hesitation if they don't join this empire. His motto is, either you are with me, or you're against me. With an added incentive that I won't reveal, Lee goes after Mr. Han with only one thing in mind, kill or be killed. In the events leading to the ultimate battle with Han, Lee displays the acrobatic skills that made him inarguably the greatest martial arts master of all time, past or present. It is quite obvious that Lee choreographed the majority of the fight scenes for the film. His style, speed, and grace are unmatched even by todays standards. Watch closely as he disposes of Han's top henchmen without breaking a sweat. With an incredible array of skills and tactics, Lee almost singlehandedly devours Han's army. But nothing compares to his climactic showdown with Mr. Han himself, so well staged that you'll probably want to watch the scene over and over. A supporting cast that included Jim Kelly(a martial arts icon in his own right), John Saxon(who studied martial arts under Lee's tutelage), Kien Shih(who plays the infamous Han), Bolo Yeung(A Chinese Hercules, so to speak) and Robert Wall(Hans top henchman), make \"Enter the Dragon\" arguably the greatest martial arts film ever made, American or foreign. For any patron of the action/drama genre it is a must see. Don't miss it!!",

            "content": "This is often hailed as the first mainstream Martial Arts Movie, and it is probably the best.The story is easy to follow. Lee, a shaolin monk, discovers that Han, a reclusive business-man who owns and lives on an island where he holds Martial Arts tournaments, has been instrumental in the recent death of his sister and mother. Because of his vengant feeling, he is hired by British government forces to investigate events on the island because they suspect that Han uses it as a base to sell illegal drugs. Lee agrees and masquerades as a participant in the tournament, although he really intends to kill Han. When Lee gets mixed up in the conflicts between Han, and some of the other participants, he battles through Han's army of henchmen to get to the man himself.First I would like to say, that this movie has the best action sequences ever on film. Particularly in Lee's final battle with Han, and his earlier battle with Han's henchmen, O'Hara. Some of the moves he pulls on them are just amazing. Bruce Lee(as the character Lee) is easily the fastest man I've ever seen. The action has never been equaled- and never will.The action is almost the sole appeal of the film, but three performances stand out. Bruce Lee's portrayal of Lee is wonderful. Lee brings a stoicism and strength to the role that makes his spectacular fighting skill completely believable. Second, Kien Shih's portrayal of Han perfectly captures the essence of a ruthless businessman, he even brings a certain self-discipline and strength to the role when he says \"It's not easy being completely ruthless.\" Third is John Saxon's portrayal of Roper. He really seems like an American tough guy.This movie also has wonderful, lavish sets, and a very fine music score which sounds like a mixture of 70s sounds, and traditional Chinese compositions.I would like to finish my review by saying this. Enter the Dragon was my first exposure to the work of Bruce Lee. I must say that he was a true Martial Arts genius and master, and I plan to check out some of his other films. May he rest in peace. He, Bruce lee, the unequaled master of combat.",

            "content": "FIRST off, let's get this out of the way. The flashback scene used to show Williams' (Jim Kelly) immediate past and his reason for entering Hahn's Big, International Martial Arts Tournament was an abomination. The depiction of Kelly's being stopped for questioning by the two Los Angeles Cops was fine, in and of itself. That is part of a Policeman's job; stopping and challenging individuals who seem to be engaging in suspicious behaviour. The young Mr. Williams' demeanor and habit of cutting down this old alley, after dark had fallen and carrying those two pieces of luggage definitely qualify as \"suspicious\".BUT then the writers, who apparently have their heads screwed on the wrong way, go for the cheap, the insulting and what would seem to be their misconception of just what is the norm for behaviour and protocol in dealing with the public; be they in Bel-Air, Hollywood or Watts.THE pair go to work on a double-teaming of unprovoked insults, hurling the derogatory epaulet \"J*g\" at him as if the word was going out of style. Furthermore, it defies any sort of common sense that these Officers (both of the Caucasian Persuasion) would engage so loosely in a manner of conduct which would: A) Immediately alienate and insult any and all of the basically all Black Citizenry in the area; and B) Insult all of the Black Officers, who they work with, side by side, day after day.IN all fairness to these writers, they no doubt are writing what they only know from the regurgitated junk that they get from reading the Left Wing, Liberal Press. Considering that these are na\u00efve individuals, who probably never even knew a friend and neighbor who was a Policeman; they have no business in writing a scene of which they have no practical experience in real life. They don't know what a great disservice to the Police, to the cause of Law and Order and lastly to the individuals who live in the Urban Ghettoes in our Country; who deserve better in both consideration and characterization.OKAY, that's off my chest; so let's get to ENTER THE DRAGON (Concord Prod./Sequoia Prod./Warner Brothers, 1973)! IN short it is just phenomenal! There is no picture quite like it. ENTER THE DRAGON is one of those sort of oxymoron type of Movies that is for just about everyone. And much to the credit of the Production Team (even the Writers), one need not be a fan of the Martial Arts Genre or a 'Black Belt' oneself in order to enjoy and appreciate it.THE use of multi-characters' stories converging at the Tournament is an excellent dramatic tool that builds interest in the characters; as well as the story line, itself. That the three main characters Lee(Bruce Lee), Roper (John Saxon) and Williams (Jim Kelly) should be representative of the three major Racial groupings of man may well be a sort of symbolism; much like the legend of the Three Kings (Wise Men) were said to be representatives of Africa, Asia and Europe. Although this may well be, personally we suspect that there was a far more practical motivation behind the casting; as in making an attempt to increase appeal to a far wider audience; hence a Bigger Boo$t to the Film$ Box Office.OF the three main men, Lee had the most important reason for being present at the Island Tourney. His assignment being to investigate the real reason for having it and to uncover just what the evil Mr. Hahn was really up to; while at the same time doing the assignment of the Shaolin Monks to find the renegade Monk who was disgracing their whole Order.SPEAKING of Hahn (Kien Shih), his characterization was a near perfect villain for the movie. Watching him operate was sort of like watching Fu Manchu, Emperor Ming, The Merciless or Dr. No going through their evil paces. Some would say that this was over the top or bigger than life. We do agree, but approve wholeheartedly; for this is what the situation called for.LADIES were not so very common in the cast; but those who were did a great bang-up job in their roles. We had Lee's Sister, Mei Ling (Betty Chung), whose virtue led to her giving up her own life's years to come, rather than being defiled by Hahn's sadistic and sexually predatory body guard. Su Lin (Angela Mao) who was the perfect operative and assistant to Lee in their investigation. And Tania (Ahna Capri), who was as worldly as she was attractive. We must also mention Roper's Secretary (the lovely, long and model like Marlene Clarke). To all of you exponents of such feminine pulchritude, we say our traditional; Woo, woo, woo, woo! ENTER THE DRAGON at once transports us to a new, different and fantastic world; yet it maintains a certain contact with reality that makes it all believable.POODLE SCHNITZ!!",

            "content": "When watching this film, which would be Bruce Lee's last fully completed film, it's not hard to wonder what could have been, for Enter the Dragon is, although with shortcomings, a great action movie. The plot is simplistic itself, following three characters Lee (Bruce Lee), Roper (John Saxon), and Williams (Jim Kelly) all attending a martial arts tournament on a secluded island for different reasons. Lee looks to spy on Han (the owner of the island played by Kien Shih), who is involved in some illegal activities for some agency and to avenge his sister's death. Roper looks to get rid of some debts he owes to somebody, and Williams is looking to just win or something (he doesn't get a lot of back-story but he does beat up some hilariously racist cops so whatever). The story isn't very detailed but it doesn't really matter because it allows the film to move at a nice pace and let the spectacular action be the real focus of the movie, and what's not to like about it? The action scenes are clear, well-shot, engaging, and creative, and the credit goes all to Bruce Lee, who acted in most of the action sequences as well as choreographing and directing the scenes. It's not hard to believe Lee could have become a great director if his life had not been cut short. As great as the action is there are a few flaws with the film. The acting is a bit hammy at times (Jim Kelly being the biggest culprit) and there are a couple of editing issues, but these are very minor complaints for an otherwise great movie.",

He was and is the best martial artist ever to grace the silver screen. I respect Sonny Chiba's (Street Fighter) style and fierceness, however, Bruce had grace, poise and an intensity in his art and acting that made the hairs on my arms stand on end when he appeared on screen. Needless to say, he had sex appeal and maintained it even when he was in the throes of beating the chi (life force) out of some idiot who believed incorrectly that he could whoop Lee in a fight.Enter The Dragon was a film which, I believe, showcased every ounce of Bruce's talents (including his use of English for the first time in his films!)

Enter the Dragon is about a martial artist, Lee, who is sent to an isolated island as a tournament member to spy on a crime lord, Han. He meets Williams and Roper while he is there. This film is a great film to watch with your friends and popcorn and the action scenes have aged very well, although some of the sound effects are very cheesy but it fits with the tone of the movie. One thing I liked about this movie is that it killed off one of the main characters, Williams. He is killed because Han thought he was roaming around at night finding secrets, but it was actually Lee that was doing that. This movie has a notorious scene. The final battle between Han and Lee in the room filled with mirrors. Many films like John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017) and The Guest (2014) have taken that scene to use as a climactic fight scene. This movie also takes some stuff from James Bond, from the way it looks and the way it sounds. It has an isolated island with a secret lair deep inside it and the villain has some sort of dismemberment. The score of the movie is also very similar, with a lot of bass and very slow.

Though it was made over 30 years ago, it looks as if it was made only yesterday. The look and feel of the film defies explanation. In fact the only hint that the film was made in 1973 was William's afro!As far as Martial arts films go, this stills stands as the king of the heap. It also bears special significance since it was the first time a Major Hollywood studio collaborated with a Hong kong film studio. The first time East and west combined to make a film together. Today it is common place, but back in the 70s it was almost unheard off.\nIt is clear that what made the film a success was Bruce Lee. His charisma and his onscreen presence was electrifying. And he was supported by a great cast. Every aspect of Enter made it the gem that it is. The dialogue, the sets, the fights, the exotic story and locations, the music, Bolo Yeung, everything!One might argue that the fight scenes in Enter the Dragon are nothing great when compared to what has been achieved since then. It is true that the martial arts choreography these days is far more intricate, but not one of these films has succeeded in duplicating that raw kinetic intensity and power of Bruce Lee's fight scenes, especially the underground cavern fight. THe power, speed and screen presence that Lee possessed was simply incredible. There was something visceral about Lee's fight scenes. They were simple, direct,effective and flashy, though not as flashy to the point that it looks like a tightly choreographed dance, which is what many fight scenes of today's chop socky films look like. Though the dancelike choreography is brilliant in its own way,The intensity of Bruce and his fight scenes was the quality that set him apart from everyone else.And to this day, Enter the Dragon is still as entertaining as it was 28 years ago. There are very few films where one can watch over and over and not get tired off. This is one of those films and because of that, its got my vote as one of the best(if not THE Best)martial arts movie of all time!May the spirit of Bruce Lee live on forever.",

            "content": "I've seen Fred Astaire dance. I've seen Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion F/X. I've even seen one or two Julia Roberts movies that didn't make me want to retch. My latest amazing film moment was witnessing the awesome martial artistry of Bruce Lee in 'Enter The Dragon'. This was supposed to be the film that would bring kung fu into the Hollywood mainstream and make Bruce Lee a superstar. He was already known to be a great martial arts master, but he worked his butt off to ensure this would be a memorable \"how do you do\" to Hollywood. And just as James Dean's death immortalized him in celluloid history, Bruce Lee's untimely death just a few weeks before the premiere of 'Enter The Dragon' cemented him forever as theeee chop-socky god.Lee and director Robert Clouse set a benchmark with this film that arguably hasn't been equaled. What was so remarkable about Lee in this picture is how fast he is...even in slo-mo. There's one scene where he kicks one guy in the face, then kicks another while still in mid-air. He wields nunchucks at such velocity that you'd be certain it was a trick shot. Nope, all real. Everything he does looks crisp, perfect, and lethal. An imitator like Jet Li can only fantasize at being this man's equal. Even Jackie Chan (who has a small role in this flick) doesn't measure up, although he IS the only martial artist that most modern audiences have ever seen.Having said that, the plot and the acting hardly matter. John Saxon and Jim Kelly are fellow white hats to Lee's Bond-like spy. The 3 of them have journeyed to a remote island to enter a tournament held by a heroin-producing thug. During the day, it's kicks and punches. At night, it's infiltration time. There isn't much else to this film, which doesn't ask its actors to stretch their thespianism very much. Lee never got to do much actual acting in his career, but they weren't paying him to deliver soliloquies. He was most effective in combat mode, narrowing his eyes and looking like a wild beast. His climactic battle with Kien Shih (culminating in a hall or mirrors) while a full-scale brawl is going on outside is by itself worth the admission.So I'm still not a big fan of chop-socky films, but I got a thrill out of seeing this one. It's fitting that the DVD would be jammed with superlatives aimed at the star. He's the whole show. The story ain't much, but the athleticism of the Chinese dragon will astound you. Rent 'Enter The Dragon' or buy it and you can even enjoy all the post-synched dialogue & the oft-imitated kung fu sound effects. There's even a wonderfully silly line when Williams says in response to why he won't notice when he's defeated, \"I'll be too busy looking goooood\". Every martial artist and stunt man in this picture looks very good. Even so, they're merely coming attractions to Bruce Lee's feature presentation.",

That is, films like Enter the Dragon and Lady Whirlwind facilitated interested and in some instances the practice and study of Asian Culture throughout North America.  Moreover, Ms. Ying in my opinion challenged certain male stereotypes often seen in movies where women were incapable of defending themselves or rescuing another person. Through dedication of her martial arts prowess and acting, I believe she helped create a more inclusive atmosphere for future generations. She is a pioneer and still a foundation from which other actresses like Cynthia Rothrock and Michelle Yeough have in some ways benefited from.End",

I love kung-fu movies, and knowing that this film was the forefather of many made it that much more enjoyable to watch. The action is still crisp and snappy, although the audio is outdated and out of sync with the video at many parts. It was fascinating to watch kung-fu legend, Bruce Lee, mix with funky basslines and American characters. I think Williams was killed as Han did not consider him valuable enough to spare, like he did for Roper. I think his death also served to be a \"look how bad the bad guy is\". Many newer films adapt Enter the Dragon's mirror room fight scene, a notable example being John Wick 2. The movie incorporates elements from James Bond, such as the suave music and infiltration plot. Enter the Dragon is a fun action movie with a diverse cast, and certainly worth your time.",

Sadly he died before the film was completed and we'll never get to see what he might have done. It's got a kind of Hollywood, James Bond feel to it but really it never manages to get far out out of B movie territory except in the big fight scene in the middle. There's definitely some interesting stuff here especially for Hong Kong martial arts movie fans with appearances from Sammo Hung, Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao, among others, plus a little commentary on race relations and police brutality in America. John Saxon legitimises the proceedings (kind of) for white western audiences although his lack of real martial arts skill is pretty glaring next to Bruce Lee and Jim Kelly. The plot is ridiculous, as is a lot of the dialogue, and a lot of the movie is funny for all the wrong reasons (the guards in their karate uniforms crack me up every time) and has dated quite badly. Probably worth watching for a great fight scene where Bruce uses his fists and feet, staff, nunchuks and Kali sticks, Considered a classic because it's Bruce's HIollywood movie, it still doesn't come close to Fist of Fury(1972) on any level.",

Enter the Dragon is an enjoyable film on most aspects. The story has good twists and isn't predictable. The fighting segments are very well choreographed and aren't too short or drag out too long. Bruce Lee is a very likable person in most of his films, this one being one of them. He has a certain charisma to him, that most other martial artists do not, such as Jet Li. This is a very good movie for Bruce Lee, but it isn't his best. I actually prefer GAME OF DEATH, but not the version that was edited without him. If that movie could have been finished, it would have been legendary. But this movie is great, so it gets a 9/10.",

            "content": "I love Bruce Lee. He was the greatest martial artist ever. His technique was immaculate, almost divine. Leonardo Da Vinci painted, Mozart composed and Bruce Lee kicked ass. It is ironic that this movie is both, a celebration of his career's peak point and also a mourning since he died unexpectedly after making this movie.Bruce Lee is Lee who is seeking revenge of his sister's death (a theme that resonates in Asian movies; in his first 2 movies, The Big Boss and Fist of Fury, Bruce Lee was also seeking revenge). Probably the most complex plots of all Bruce Lee movies, Lee goes undercover to Shaolin temple in an island to monitor the activities of a man named Han who is suspected to be involved in illegal activities such as opium trade. Han runs a martial art school on the island. Bruce Lee is joined by two other major martial artists, John Saxon and Jim Kelly who play contestants in a deadly tournament that will take place on the island.As you can guess, all hell breaks loose at the tournament where we get to enjoy marvelous martial art moves. Bruce Lee shines with his amazing technique. It is so unfortunate that this is the last Bruce Lee movie. If he had lived, I imagine that he would have made tons of great martial art movies. He became a legend with only 3-4 movies and is still considered to be the greatest. He was the lean mean ultimate kick-ass machine. If you like ass kicking, you will love Bruce Lee.",

            "content": "\"Enter the Dragon\" was simultaneously Bruce Lee's Hollywood debut and his swan song. He died in July of 1973, about a month before the film premiered. The combination of the film and his untimely death are the cornerstones of his legend today.Yet, while the film may be legendary, is it really *that* good? I think that among the multitude of followers there have been some who have bettered Lee's first Hollywood outing. Nevertheless, one must give credit where credit is due and ponder what heights Lee might have reached had his career not been tragically cut short.The storyline here is basically just a flimsy excuse for getting Lee onto an island for some cloak and dagger spy work and plenty of hand to hand combat. Think of Bruce Lee as the Chinese equivalent of James Bond. As you might expect, the martial arts segments do not disappoint, particularly when Bruce Lee takes centre stage. The best showcase of his talents is in a lengthy battle with an army of thugs. Then there's the inevitable showdown with the villain Han, which takes place in a room full of mirrors. That scene is easily the most appealing in the film from a visual standpoint.Unsurprisingly, the acting here isn't exactly Academy Award material. Of the 'deadly three', Lee & John Saxon (Roper) are passable actors but first-timer Jim Kelly (Williams) gives a few torturously bad line readings. That's a shame, because the character of Williams was undoubtedly meant to be a real bad-ass in the blaxploitation mold. The various Hong Kong actors fit in seamlessly and the dubbing isn't too bad.The direction and music is vintage 70's but that just adds to the film's flavour. Despite the lackluster acting, feeble story, and campy style I'll bet that by the end you'll be itching to unleash some fury, Bruce Lee-style. So, while Lee's initial Hollywood effort has since been eclipsed it's certainly still worth watching in order to witness the birth of a legend.",

It is one of the first, if not the first, martial arts film to combine Western and Oriental actors, and for that it is one of the most well remembered martial arts films of all time. Lee stars as a martial artist who is hired as a secret agent investigating a drug ring located on an island belonging to a rich crime lord named Han. His ticket onto Han's island is an invitation for a grand martial arts tournament Han is hosting on his island. If the plot sounds cheesy and simplistic that's because it is.Enter the Dragon has all the cheesiness of a martial arts film as well as the general campiness of 70's action flicks. Therefore, you can expect quite a bit of cheese eaten material throughout this film. The acting is flat, the script is ridiculously basic and incredibly dry, and the plot in general is paper thin. But, the thing is, Enter the Dragon isn't a movie we watch for its thick plot, complex characters, or superb acting. It's a film we watch for the action. Specifically, the martial arts action. And we certainly get what we came for. Bruce Lee stages all the fight scenes in this grandiose martial arts picture, and it does not fail to disappoint on that front. You can't expect too much from this film. All you can hope for is some brilliant ass kicking, and you get just that.This is a film with a very specific style that is heavily influenced by the time period in which it was made and the aspect around which it revolves, and that aspect is the martial arts action. Keeping this in mind I can forgive the cheesiness of Enter the Dragon and really just bring myself to enjoy it. This film is a lot of fun and is loaded with awesome fight sequences that rarely seem to let up. It feels like a \"so bad it's good\" kind of film, which in some respects it is, but as far as any martial arts aficionado is concerned it is of a pristine quality of martial arts action. It's not really my kind of thing but I can recognize where the talent and quality lies.",

The fighting scenes were extremely memorable and still leaves me amazed about how the movies was only filmed with 2 cameras. Although it was an incredible film, some aspects to the movie did not age well. The way the women in this film are shown, portrays them to be some sort of object given out to praise others. If a film had a scene like this in 2017, there would be a lot of controversy. The sound effects, specifically with the hitting, in this film were quite distracting and countered the whole theme of the movie. Other then these points, I feel that the film managed to age well and continue to entertain its' audience. There is one character who does not make out alive in the end, and that is William. He is suspected of lurking around after dark and deems himself untrustworthy to Han. I believe he is killed off in an epic fight scene due to these reasons, and Roper is left untouched. A new film that actually pays homage to Enter The Dragon would be John Wick 2. There is a scene in the film where the villains are walking through a hall of mirrors, which is a tribute to the battle between Han and Lee in the room of mirrors. Although Enter The Dragon inspired many movies, it also took inspiration from some as well. The whole theme of infiltrating an unreachable island was stolen from all the James Bond movies. The whole mood of the movie really reminded me of the James Bond movie which makes it such a great film. Overall, I feel Enter The Dragon is Bruce Lee's best movie and was definitely worth my time watching.",

I think it was certainly worth my time mainly because of the acting and the not paper-thin plot that a lot of movies like this seem to have. Williams died instead of roper, in my personal opinion because he was the more disrespectful of the two and the fact that Han saw him less as a business partner like roper but as someone who flaunts the rules. This is because Williams is seen outside during the curfew and refuses to \"rat\" out Lee after seeing him outside. While Roper is a betting business man. Later movies like Karate kid pay homage with the tournament setting for the movie with the evil martial artist who disgraced the main character's martial art establishment or the art itself. This movie does almost shameless homage to earlier spy movies like James Bond with the music in some segments and the evil villain vibe Han gives off. In addition there is the master he has and underground lair that is very much like an old bond movie.",

Enter the Dragon starts out as it means to go on, with a Chinese boxing match between Lee and some chump who thinks he might have a chance.

The tournament is ran by a feller called Han who only has one hand and is doing some dodgy dealings with drugs and women, Lee gets sent in to pin evidence on the crook, but not without fighting of course. Lee is also joined by Williams and Roper, both of whom get forced into the tournament.

As displayed by Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon, these qualities have never been more beautiful to behold in a martial arts film.I highly recommend the 75th Anniversary Warner Brothers special edition, which includes two short additional scenes which allow Lee to reflect on his own martial arts philosophy and which explain why he decides to break the mirrors in the final action scene.  However, the main reason to check out the special edition is the inclusion of a half hour documentary on Lee which precedes the film itself.  In it, the viewer is treated to an intimate introduction to the man and the martial artist.As for the film, the predictable plot makes the filler scenes between the action sequences a bit boring (especially if you've seen the film dozens of times as I have).  When Lee is on screen, however, the film kicks up several notches and, when he's fighting, the screen is on fire.Enter the Dragon is significant to Western audiences for another, less known, reason.  With the exception of the Chinese Connection (released in Hong Kong as Fists of Fury), Enter the Dragon is the only Bruce Lee film where you hear his real voice during the fight scenes and in regular dialogue.  If you've seen Return of the Dragon (aka Way of the Dragon) or Fist of Fury (aka the Big Boss), you'll hear his fighting yells reduced to a whimper by dubbing which is as disgraceful as it is unnecessary.I have a few footnotes to this Comment.  First, Lee deserves much credit in seeing the need for the introductory spar at the temple; otherwise the viewer would have had to wait ages before his first fight with O'Hara on the island.  Second, the voice of Lee in the first new scene (where he walks with the master immediately following the introductory spar at the temple) is dubbed. Third, the camera is too close on several occasions during the fight with O'Hara, especially where Lee serves up roundhouse kicks.  Fourth, having Roper fight Bolo instead of Lee was disappointing.  Fifth, the fight with Han takes a disappointing turn when they enter the mirrored hall, where the fighting basically slows to a standstill.Nevertheless, at the end of the movie, as Lee gives a thumbs up following a long battle with Han, the overall feeling is of course still very positive, and one is left wondering what could have been had Lee lived to make more films to fulfill his incredible potential.",

I don't think the film has aged well due to outdated soundtrack and camera shots, but will remain a classic for a long time. I think that Han killed Williams because he knew they were up to something, but spared Roper because he deemed him more valuable. Many films replicate Into the Dragon's style, such as Kill Bill, and the mirror scene in John Wick 2 was definitely a homage to this movie. Seeing as many of today's movies take from Into the dragon, it is definitely worth the watch. Would watch again.",

However, I lost my interest when the fighters arrived at the island where the tournament was held, as the seriousness gave its place to handsome guys, clever quotes and very few fights (especially between the fighters), which were obviously fake (I don't mind that because of the time the film was made).

But in my opinion the film has aged well because once you start watching it you enjoy watching it and you do not realize all those details. I think Han killed William because he thought he killed his workers. A film that pays tribute to this movie is Kill Bill, because you can see how many actions are similar to the movie enter the dragon. Enter the Dragon copied many details of the James Bond movie.",

This is the Hollywood granddaddy of 'em all, and not just because of Bruce Lee. Admittedly, Bruce Lee supplies the best fight scenes in the film (the one featuring ex-model John Saxon is very disappointing. Brutish Bolo is touted as the big boss fighter throughout the movie, and when he doesn't actually fight Lee, it's a definite let-down.). The film also has cameo performances from some very big name performers before they became internationally-known: Chuck Norris, Jackie Chan, and Sammo Hung are the three I noticed. Unfortunately, they are not listed in the credits.Bruce Lee is great to watch, not just as a supreme martial artist but also for the anatomy lesson he provides. Lee is all bone, sinew, and muscle, and his skin almost seems to be an afterthought. There's not a shred of fat on his frame, and it is easy to see which muscles come into play for various movements.The film is filled with vintage 70s cheese, from the over-the-top cool cat performance of Jim Kelly and his afro, to the funky wakka-wakka guitar music. Every punch and every kick, even if it doesn't actually hit anything, is accompanied by a swooshing or smacking sound effect. It's as though every strike breaks the sound barrier. And when contact is actually made, enormous thwacking sounds accompany it. I may only be a yellow belt in karate, but something tells me if my arm really made that smacking sound every time I punched, there must be something horribly wrong with my joints.I found the panoramic scenes of karateka training to be very interesting. It looks like a complete hodgepodge of styles. I also noticed an awful lot of white belts, considering the setting is an elite invitational tournament. I thought the white belts would be there as practice targets for the masters, but the movie just didn't shape up that way. Instead, it was the hapless guards who got to be the punching bags. Something tells me all the students from all the martial arts schools in the Hong Kong area were herded onto the set as extras. I saw a lot of sloppy strikes during the punching drills, and many of the white belts didn't appear able to tie their belts properly. I saw more than one belt tied like a big floppy shoe lace, and a couple with one end poking straight up toward the wearers' chests.The version of the film I saw includes a behind-the-scenes short and an interview with Bruce Lee, featuring some home video footage and some of Lee's philosophies on martial arts. I enjoyed watching Lee teach his infant son how to do kicks, but could have done without the syrupy aggrandizing of Lee's wife.As with most martial arts films, don't watch this expecting much in the way of plot. Watch it for Lee. He really is awe-inspiring.",

Most importantly he taught his students to completely end the fight in the shortest possible time.Enjoy \"Enter the Dragon\" as you will see an absolute martial art genius try to educate us Westerners that the Chinese are not the dimwits portrayed by Hollywood but instead shows that Chinese Martial Arts has true power.",

Bruce Lee acts as a martial artist expert who is infiltrated in a private island governed by the suspected criminal lord Han (Shin Kien). He attends a martial arts tournament, also joined by gambler Roper (John Saxon) and Vietnam war veteran Williams (Jim Kelly). It is soon clear that Han is a brutal dictator, who among other crimes beats Williams to death because he didn't want to cooperate. If not willing to cooperate, all the other competitors, now almost prisoners, have to fear the same destiny. Thanks to Lee strength, ability and cleverness, they are all saved by the military, called to take control of the island. Because I don't like Kung-Fu movies, I didn't really like this movie, and i found it repetitive and boring. However, I think it was worth my time watching because it is considered to be one of the most famous martial movie of all times. Moreover, Bruce Lee became an icon within movies of his genre. Even if Enter The Dragon is now more than 40 years old, it is still fascinating. Kung-Fu scenes have some grace in them (especially the ones played by Bruce Lee) and the fighting is realistic. Nevertheless, the audio quality is not that good. Audio doesn't match to lip movements or to actions, and some sounds are not realistic. I guess we could say that the movie did not age well from a cinematic point of view, but it is still a great movie because of acting and contents. Enter The Dragon clearly \"steal\" some ingredients from James Bond, as the music and the quantity of action. However, it is does represent an inspiration for newer martial arts movies, as Karate Kid or Rocky.

Mao also keeps girls on the island that he drugs with opium to use as comfort women for his once-in-three-years kung fu tournament, which serves as a convenient excuse to bring in the world's kung fu masters. These masters consist of: Jim Kelly as The Afro Ninja, John Saxon as Budget Sean Connery, and some other Chinese kung fu guys I don't recognize. Also, Jackie Chan makes a very early cameo as a guy who gets kicked in the balls by Bruce Lee's sister! Who knew it would be a staple to come??A lot of punching and kicking happens, Afro Ninja gets fed to the sharks with lazer beams attached to their heads, and Bruce Lee kicks Chairman Mao into a spear in the Mirror Room they stole from Man With the Golden Gun. Boy, they really did lean heavily into the Bond references.Anyway, it's probably the most competently made Bruce Lee movie, eschewing the typical \"local triad boss is taking kids lunch money, beat em up, Bruce!\" scenario. Definitely worth a watch if you're a kung fu fan. 6.5/10.",

Bruce Lee plays Lee who is assigned to participate in a martial arts tournament that's a front for the sinister Han's (Kien Shih) illegal activities such as prostitution and opium dealing. John Saxon and Jim Kelly costar as participants for their own personal ambitions.  Look for cameo appearances by Jackie Chan (he gets his neck broken) and Sammo Hung (in the first scene).

            "content": "Not only is it sad to see the early death of such a promising young performer as Lee, who had finally hit the Hollywood big time after years of struggle and movie bit-parts. But it is also sad that given a few more years he could have made some truly marvellous high quality production movies on a James Bond scale.As it is all we have left to be thankful for are his earlier movies where plots & production values simply do not do justice to the name of Bruce Lee.\nA lot of people compare him to a modern day Jackie Chan, although even Chan would freely admit that he owes a great deal to the great man especially when it comes to the years of dedicated training & mind control required to get as far as Bruce did.Enter the Dragon, is a far from perfect MA film. The story is a little clumsy, the acting totally unconvincing by all concerned (including Bob Wall & John Saxon). The settings are little chintzy & vapid and the dubbing is quite terrible.So why is this film revered above all the other MA movies? Because its where Lee is given the freedom to excel in his profession; for once the entire western world got the chance to see some truly amazing MA action and realise that none of it was stunt-doubled, none of it was down to special effects or camera tricks.What you see from Bruce is very much what you get. Of course we all went ga-ga during his first proper fight sequence in the underground caverns, but it's not just the physical aspect that Lee aspired too, but also the mental & the spiritual, something we don't always get to see in the movie. Although if you look at  some of his strained facial expressions you can tell he is putting an awful lot of psychological will as well as muscle into what he does.Of course, the latter day pretenders like Chan, have it relatively easy now that Lee broke the mould and introduced MA to a disbelieving western world. And along with Chan comes big budgets for bigger & more intricate set-pieces, to which Chan really aspires.But doesn't this miss the true point of MA? Lee never had to resort to such Hollywoodesque extremes as jumping through a dozen windows on a motorbike before beating up the baddies; Lee knew his own limits and respected his art. Enter The Dragon is a poor film by modern day standards but remains perhaps the best visual example of natural martial arts anywhere!***/*****",

            "content": "I must say, this was one helluva showcase for Bruce Lee; it's the film that made him an international star. The plot is simple enough: a martial artist is hired by government agents to spy on a reclusive crime boss while competing in the boss' martial arts tournament. This, of course, gives plenty of opportunities for fight scenes, which Lee choreographed himself, and these scenes certainly don't disappoint. Many can't believe that no camera tricks were used to augment Lee's fighting--just watch his fight with the boss' bearded henchman and marvel at his speed.Don't expect anything innovative or especially inspirational; there is no doubt that this is a genre movie. But this is to martial arts films what The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is to Westerns. It's easy to enjoy this film because a) it takes itself seriously enough that the audience doesn't feel like it's being mocked or taken advantage of (i.e. says the Producer to the Director \"I can't believe the fools sat through the whole thing!\"), and b) there's some tongue-in-cheek humor that help you realize that it doesn't take itself TOO seriously. Case in point: one of my favorite lines is when one of the tournament competitors tells the crime boss, \"Man, you are something right out of a comic book!\" Then they proceed to fight. See? Simple and predictable, yet enjoyable, sure to entertain anyone with any interest in the genre.As a side note, this film is crucial viewing if one is to fully appreciate the underrated genius of The Kentucky Fried Movie. The main segment of the KFM is a spot-on, hilarious spoof of Enter the Dragon called \"A Fistful of Yen,\" so watch this, then watch KFM, and enjoy!",

Many MA movies try to boost up their story with confusing turns, but that never works out (and I've seen quite a lot of these movies). Enter the Dragon doesn't do that.Bruce Lees performance is outstanding. No tricks, no special effects, no men on wires, no computer animations - just pure martial arts. His speed is unbelievable, but true.Of course, modern movies by Jackie Chan or Jet Li feature far more extraordinary action, stunts and breathtaking fights. But that's not the same. Those movies are too overemphasized to match the purity of Enter the Dragon.Even if you feel that Enter the Dragon is an imperfect movie, you can at least feel the potential that Bruce Lee had.

            "content": "Sometimes it's not the film itself that creates a cult following, but an actor. On occasion a film may contain one striking performance from one actor that creates such an impact that they and the film become embedded in pop culture for decades to come. Enter the Dragon is one of those films, it's an excellent martial arts movie with some wonderful set pieces a memorable villain and some of the most well shot, well executed fight scenes in cinema history. However, none of those things is what you'll walk away from Enter the Dragon remembering, there's one thing about this film that makes it such a huge cult hit and that thing is Bruce Lee.Bruce Lee is one of the few actors to create such a following and myth about themselves with so little films to their names, he falls into the category of James Dean becoming an icon before an untimely death. Enter the Dragon was intended to be Lee's breakout performance and launch him to A-list Hollywood status. Sadly Lee died before the release but that didn't stop the public from embracing this low-rent martial arts film and its star.Enter the Dragon is, in essence a James Bond film. The plot is strikingly similar to Dr. No with a secret agent Lee (Bruce Lee) heading to an island fortress of a shady, disfigured villain (Kien Shih) in order to put a stop to his evil schemes. The plot is simple and effective; Lee must go to the island hideout of crime boss Han (Kien Shih) and uncover any dirt on him while competing in a martial arts tournament, it's a surprise EON didn't sue them! The simplicity of the plot is excellent, this film isn't trying to be anything more than an excellent martial arts adventure story and it succeeds.The film is very much a slow burner, taking its time with the action allowing the audience to really crave for Lee to unleash a fury that the audience know he is capable of and when he does start crushing skulls it's doubly satisfying. Lee's performance is not only about his physicality or his martial arts ability, that's what may draw viewers in but they'll stay due to Lee's brilliant performance, he's an incredibly likable and well capable performer and is much more than a glorified stunt man, he's a talented actor. Lee also has one of the finest screen presences off all time, once he walks in front of the camera all eyes are on him waiting for what he'll do next.The direction by Robert Clouse is the other star of the film; it's much like the script in that it's simple and effective with a little bit of flamboyance here and there. The way Clouse shoots the fights scenes should be textbook for any director, the audience are allowed to see and experience every kick and punch that is thrown and it's so incredibly refreshing to see a director know how to shoot a fight scene as many today use the \"Bourne style\" shaky cam to hide the fact they have no idea what they're doing. The highlight fight scene is the climactic Hall of Mirrors sequence which is quite possibly the most well executed and brilliantly shot fight scene in cinema history.The film really is James Bond meets Fu Manchu with Lee sneaking around an underground fortress that looks like it came straight out of a 60\u2032s Bond film. Much like the early Bond movies Enter the Dragon has impressive scope especially considering it only takes place on no more than three major locations.Enter the Dragon also contains some brilliantly odd cult moments, best of them all being the over-dubbing on certain actors. While Han's voice is provided by Chinese-American actor Keye Luke and Lee dubbed his own voice some of the other Asian actors have the unfortunate fate of sounding like John Wayne to hilarious results. The film also captures the same cheesy brilliance of the classic Bond movies without being a parody. These things of course add to the charm of Enter the Dragon creating a truly fun action/adventure spy movie.The film has a few genuine flaws; the major one being the supporting hero's played by John Saxon and Jim Kelly are bland and far less believable than the legitimate fighter Bruce Lee. Whenever their characters are on screen you yearn for Lee to come back, wondering what he's up to. There's also a personal conflict added between Lee and one of Han's henchmen involving Lee's sister and it seems forced in for the sake of it but it does lead to two of the best action sequences of the film so it can be forgiven.Enter the Dragon is an absolute classic of martial arts cinema, it contains some of the best action and fights scenes of all time, some incredible stunts and one of the best villains of the genre. The crowning jewel however is Bruce Lee, he truly was a special individual who could have been a huge star. The worst thing about Enter the Dragon is that it would be Bruce Lee's last performance before he passed away.Lines to Live by: \"My style? You can call it the art of fighting without fighting.\"Oddest Moment: Keep an eye out for a young Jackie Chan during the underground siege by Lee settling once and for all that Bruce Lee would beat Jackie Chan in a fight.",

And, we are not reminded of the the rest of the movie while watching him. The movie knows its strengths and drawbacks. It keeps the plot to a bare minimum and showcases Bruce Lee most of the time.

            "content": "In light of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' tearing up the American box office, it's a good time to reflect upon the first time a martial arts film made such an impact.It's been more than 20 years, but Bruce Lee's sole Hollywood starring role still has a lot to impress the audience.  Sure, the plotline is sub-Bond, and a lot of the acting and dialogue is pretty laughable.  I've always found Jim Kelly to be the funniest of the lot, his \"I'll be too busy looking goooood ...\" causing a huge grin to break out across my face.But then there's Bruce Lee, with his intense gaze and body coiled to spring like a predatory animal.  That's the reason to see this film.  According to eyewitnesses, Bruce Lee was a true martial artist par excellence first and an actor second.  And due to fate being unkind, he left this world too soon, with only a small body of film work left as a testament to his personal achievements - mental, physical and spiritual.'Enter the Dragon' is the best of these cinematic records, in part due to the fact it is the best made of them all - Warner Brothers supplying a decent budget and production values.  Also, because Bruce Lee's onscreen persona was an extension of his true self (the character simply called \"Mr. Lee\").  This held true throughout all his Hong Kong films, but even more so in 'Enter the Dragon'.  Among my favorite parts of the movie are where Bruce verbally expresses his views on the martial arts (\"It is like a finger pointing towards the moon\") or the scene where he outwits the Australian karateka (an unworthy blowhard) rather than fighting him. > From one point of view, these scenes can come across as pretty campy, with Bruce Lee almost sounding like a fortune cookie (my apologies for the analogy, no insults intended).  But he says them with such conviction, I cannot help but find myself believing him.  (Watch the television interview included on the 25th Anniversary edition tape for more of the same).Then there's the fighting scenes.  Now, in the intervening years, the Hong Kong film industry has pretty much re-written how fight scenes of all kinds are filmed - from fisticuffs to bullets.  Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and Sammo Hung have made movies more daring, fast-paced, or innovative, but 'Enter' still stands as a major benchmark.  In some ways, it is far more realistic than anything made today, since most of the fights follow the realities of hand-to-hand combat: He who gets in the best shot first wins, and the better guy usually gets in the first best shot.  No wires, trampolines or acrobatics, just solid, brutal action.  It's not very pretty, but it certainly has a captivating ferocity I can't take my eyes off of.  Just check out that crotch kick Bruce Lee delivers to Bob Wall (as O'Hara) halfway through the movie.So, Bruce Lee, allow me to bow in respect.  You earned it.",

Afros, nunchucks, snakes, kicking, punching, cheesy music, funny faces and noises, and some very cheesy line readings. Most of the movie is kind of lacking a little bit, but this movies 3rd act is pretty darn fun.The first two acts are kind of more story driven. We have Bruce Lee's character infiltrating a fighting competition in order to take down the big bad guy. Nothing too original here, just your classic cheesy action movie plot. We have some occasionally interesting dialogue between characters, but I felt it was kind of boring at times, even the fighting! I think I find fights in movie that take place in an arena of some sort to be a little boring. I like the out of the ring kind of fights, with blood and bone breaking and weapons. Most of the fights in act one and two are in a ring, however, making it a little contained and underwhelming. Once Bruce Lee starts to fight outside the competition, that's when things gets fun.The third act is the best part of this movie. There's lots of fighting and drama, and it's when everything comes to a climax. Even though the set up isn't great, you can't deny this awesome finally. Highlights include an amazing sequence in a hall of mirror, which just looks great on film and is something you couldn't find in many other movies. The finale makes up for the boring and underwhelming scenes throughout the rest of the movie, that's for sure.While I don't think Enter The Dragon is amazing, I do think it has some sequences that need to be seen by fans of martial arts movies. It can be a lot of fun at times, and it makes sense why it is a classic martial arts movie.",

Enter The Dragon is a movie that contains not only a handful of unique and genius fighting scenes but also a great deal of master lee's philosophy and way of thinking.

With Bruce's pulsating side kick, hook kicks and nunchakus, this is definitely my favorite picture of all Martial Arts Movies.But even if you don't like Martial Arts, and/or don't care, it's a great movie in its own right, and one anybody can appreciate.Watch it, you might learn something.",

Aside from the obvious fun of the fight scenes, there is an intelligent and thought-provoking plot, as well as great cinematography and direction.Each of the three combatants represent a theme: Williams (Jim Kelly) - He has two sides: 1. He's dealt with prejudice and poverty, and he's been compassionate and strong. 2. His other side, the, \"I want to look good\" is his fault. His demise (he looks quite terrible at the end, as expressed so well by John Saxon) is ideologically the price he pays for his vanity.Roper (John Saxon) - He is of course the 'gambler'. His gambling represents a willingness to take a risk - when the risk is taken without careful consideration (the insect fight) you usually lose, but risk taken with careful consideration (the 'fixed fight') your chances are good. This trait, along with his insight into his own nature, both bad and good, and his open-mindedness (we see that he is in a mixed-relationship when we first meet him) are all positive points, and he will be rewarded by surviving in the end.Lee (Bruce Lee) - A spiritual and complex character. Philosophical and disciplined, his brute force and skill are tempered with intelligence, self-restraint, and virtue. His '13th code' of the temple that he is asked to recite is the real moral here; \"I am responsible for my own actions.\".",

The female roles leave a lot to be desired, and give an apt reminder of how far things have come, but still have to go. Viewing the film's exploitation of violence now, it's impossible to avoid thinking of Tarantino (which no doubt would please him), and it's easy to see why the raw violence presented led to the film's original 'X' rating in the UK, even after cuts. The context today is obviously very different from 1973, and the genie of movie violence was well and truly out of the bottle some time ago, due to films like Enter the Dragon, but hopefully the film also can be seen now as having achieved part of Bruce Lee's aim of revealing aspects of the beauty of Chinese culture, even if only in a small way.",

This movie came out in the early 1970s, back when action movies haven't fully attracted audiences around the world. But along came Enter the Dragon. This movie really launched the action genre to be one of the most common genres. The action scenes all really hold up, although some of the sound effects didn't age that well but it doesn't take itself seriously so most of it holds up well. One thing that doesn't hold up is the use of female characters. They are mostly used as sex symbols, because nowadays females have much bigger roles in movies, they impact the plot. During the film one of the main characters is killed, Williams, and it took me a while to figure out why he was killed. I think he was killed because Han though that he was the one roaming around at night. Newer films like John Wick Chapter 2 (2017) and The Guest (2014) have taken one scene in particular. The scene where Lee fights Han in the room filled with mirrors. No one had seen a scene like that back then. But what this movies takes from other movies is the look of the movie looks like and sounds like a James Bond movie. The isolated island with a secret lair deep inside it. The music score has a lot of bass and very slow. This movie is a lot of fun to watch. It is a perfect movie to have friends over and watch it with popcorn.",

The film revolves around a martial artist who agrees to go undercover to infiltrate a crime lord's island by participating in a deadly tournament. This is also Bruce Lee's final film that inspired many films, T.V., and books after the film's release that is. If Bruce Lee were alive to see his accomplishment and achievement in making this gorgeous film I have a feeling that he would be proud of himself. This is also, if I might add, the best martial arts film that will stand the test of time for many decades to come. And also no other martial arts film will ever be as good as Enter the Dragon with Bruce Lee being the king of martial arts. The other martial artists like Jackie Chan and Jet Li are incredible as well and have produced many entertaining movies, but nobody beats the king as well as the king of martial artists films. Even though this a fantastic martial arts film the dialogue, acting, and writing, are terrible as it sounds like it came from the imagination of a twelve year old who played way too much Dungeons and Dragons. But what it lacks in those departments makes up for the kung fu department, which we all came to see. And lets be honest if you're watching a kung fu movie don't expect the acting, writing, or dialogue to be fantastic because nobody pays to see that. Unlike with some martial arts films, which have amazing choreographed kung fu techniques, Bruce Lee is an artist when it comes to kung fu. And with some movies trying to mimic Bruce Lee's fighting techniques they don't do it justice, as Bruce Lee would look down on that and shake his head. Watching this film is like watching a James Bond film. And that's what this movie is, is the Dr. No of kung-fu movies. So overall, if you're a fan of martial arts films than you can't call yourself a fan of martial arts films until you've experienced this masterpiece that started it all.",

Mind you, Enter The Dragon is the first Hollwood production of the martial arts gerne, but budget does not equal quality. Comparatively, Enter The Dragon blew any other completed martial arts film of that era out of the water. I say Completed because Bruce Lee's game of death was Bruce Lee's master piece, however, it was only completed until after his death, and it was massacred by Hollywood's directors.Enter The Dragon is an intelligent film, using Lee's philosophical wisdom, and the real problems such as drugs, racism, and rape. This film, unlike the Big Boss, Fists of fury, and the way of the dragon, Lee's enter the dragon showed elements of humanity. A side to Lee seen only off set. On top of all of this, there were elements of spy films, a good vs. evil element, a \"join the dark side element\" seen with Roper and Han, and showed the cons of being an unadept fighter by using only one martial art.Robert Clouse, the director, combined with Bruce Lee's wisdom of martial arts proved to be a dynamic spectacle. Bruce lee's powerful presence made the film, combined with John Saxon's talent, Jim Kellys cool attitude, and Han's maniacal nature had all pieced together beautifully. The fight scenes flowed, unlike the choppy nature of the other films of this era. Miraculously, the fight scenes were not sped up, but slowed down, because of Lee's sheer speed.Lastly, Enter THe Dragon set standards for martial arts films every where, standards not realized until the 1990s.PS Watch out for Jackie Chan in this film, he is one of the henchmen, and his kneck was broken by Bruce himself.",

The first time Hollywood took a financial interest in kung-fu, it indelibly feels more like a Hollywood action flick of the 70s than Lee's earlier work. Which, in my book, is a strike against it. Part of the charm and thrill of Bruce Lee films is the near kitchiness, an almost camp quality in their filming. The plot sags, forcing the plot forward, constantly pushing for the next battle in which Bruce Lee can take on hoards of unworthy opponents. The film takes itself more seriously than films like 'Fist of Fury' or 'The Big Boss.' It asks the viewer to believe whole-heartedly in the carefully choreographed battles. Han, the drug smuggling under-lord Lee attempts to take down, feels unmotivated, a collage of \"bad-guy\" stereotypes that never really feels motivated. The basic premise of the film, a fighting tournament on Han's private island, is given little prelude or reason and is quickly forgotten as the film pushes it's good vs. evil theme, which, of course, means more fighting. Though it's legacy asserts otherwise, 'Enter the Dragon' is the least enjoyable of Lee's films, the least authentic, and the least motivated. It craves the bigger, more Hollywood, premise and pretenses, drugs and gangsters versus the peasantry and craft of fighting that was spotlighted more in Lee's domestic films. Nonetheless essential viewing for its flaws, it still remains the least engaging and least enjoyable of the (too few) films in Bruce Lee's career.",

Bruce Lee's presence in this film is inevitable and radiant.  His skill, speed and agility are unsurpassed and is portrayed as a tough bad ass!  I like the character of Han a lot and he is seen as \"totally ruthless.\"  It sucks that Williams was killed by him.  Jim Kelly is a great martial artist and his attitude is very similar to Shaft and I found that very humourous. John Saxon was cool too.  Typical ignorant, gambler white guy.  His fight against Bolo Yeung was a rather \"cheap\" victory though.  The obvious highlights in this film were the fights of Bruce Lee.  In the underground scene his strength and agility are truly shown.  I wish the nunchucks were used more often in the movie however. Anyways, Enter the Dragon is highly recommended for any fan of Bruce Lee's or any action movie fan.  This movie is better than a lot of cheesy, stupid action movies that are being made today. Also, look for cameo appearances by Jackie Chan and Sammo Kam-Bo.  They both get their asses kicked by good old Bruce!!",

Enter the dragon is a sign that Kung Fu movies can succeed by acknowledging it's origins.",

This movie is everything good martial arts movies should be: poorly dubbed (English over English), humorous in places that shouldn't be, and a showcase for some excellent martial arts acting/action. (Looking convincing as a martial artist in a movie requires real talent in the martial arts; that's why so many successful martial arts movie stars started out as successful martial artists.)Enter the Dragon is a very entertaining movie, despite its shortcomings (or, rather, in part because of them). Watch The Kentucky Fried Movie afterward for some real belly laughs; the well-made part of the Fried satire that was inspired by Dragon will make you appreciate this 70's classic even more.---Edit: Having just watched the Kentucky Fried Movie (KFM) again, I must warn you that the humor is quite outdated and juvenile. (There are several parodies of then-current advertisements and trends that many people today won't recognize.) Still, it's worth seeing KFM and fast-forwarding to the \"Fistful of Yen\" satire couched in the middle of it.G-",

I would deem Bruce Lee's final film as a turning point, where another action hero franchise would have originated.  Han might be a carbon copy of Dr. No and Ernst Stavro Blofeld (e.g. an island headquarters and a white Persian cat), as well as the island headquarters, with a drug lab and human subjects for testing heroin.  I would deem this film as Bruce Lee glorifying 007, since he goes undercover.  The only thing that Lee would be best remembered for are his screams and howling on screen.  The scene where the showdown takes place might make Freddy Krueger experiencing nightmares.  Lots of athletes that would become actors, which include Bolo Yeung (Double Impact) and Jim Kelly (Black Belt Jones).

The fact that it is based on a mysterious island run by a crime boss with a speciality for the martial arts was beyond belief. The casting of John Saxon as the powerful white man with higher martial art capabilities than all of the other Asian followers was too much of a complement.

            "content": "I think that this film was definitely worth time watching even though it was an older film. Even though some of the sounds for the fighting scenes were pretty generic the action in the movie was great. It's story line was good but pretty stereotypical of a kung fu action movie but it would seem less stereotypical seeing the movie at the time when it came out. I think they killed Williams instead of roper because there was still prejudice against black people at that time and it would most likely settle better with the audience of that time having the black guy die rather than the white one. Even in many modern day movies and TV shows the black guy ends up getting killed off, such as in the walking dead. I think the film has aged pretty well since it has a good story line and the action although dated still is exciting. Although the picture and sound quality isn't up to par with most of today's movies there are some scenes in the movie that i very much liked such as the mirror room fight scene. Most kung fu films takes after many aspects of this film since it was the first of it's kind such as Kill Bill and many films featuring Jackie Chan. This movie steals a lot from James Bond even with the music that sounds extremely similar to that which is from the James Bond movie series. They also stole the much of the basic story line of James Bond films with the one bad guy and the good guy has to take him down in a spy like manner.",

            "content": "East meets west in the quintessential martial arts movie known as Enter the Dragon. The film was marketed as an ambitious kung fu movie. It's also pivotal because it was one of the first (if not the first) Hollywood produced kung fu movie. The keen point about Enter the Dragon, unlike similar movies of the same genre, is that it is not entirely style over substance. It's true that kung fu is glorified and for about 3/4ths of the film audiences are subjected to high-flying kicks and swift-fisted duels\u2014but that is essential to the fun.Penned by Michael Allin and choreographed by Bruce Lee himself, it's easy to recognize the reason for Enter the Dragon's cult following. Various television shows, movies, and even children's programs (ie: Jackie Chan Adventures) have spoofed the film, but Enter the Dragon provides kung fu entertainment to old and contemporary audiences. The plot revolves around a former Shaolin monk named Han whom, every three years in a remote island near Hong Kong, hosts an epic martial arts tournament. But behind the glorified combat and Han's prestigious hospitality lies a nasty secret in the form of illegal drug racketeering, misogyny and contraband. The British intelligence hires Bruce Lee to infiltrate the operation and obtain evidence to prosecute Han. Lee is virtually playing himself in some very well-deserved spotlight, for Enter the Dragon is the culmination of both Lee's physical and on screen career. I suppose another name for Lee would be \"the Dragon\" (this is for obvious reasons). He's an absolute; untouchable and impervious to pain. Blood is especially delicious to Lee who relishes it after a nasty cut. If he had a pet to go fetch his mail and chase away the mail man, it would be a king cobra. Enter the Dragon culturally integrates two American actors playing American characters. They are Jim Kelly debuting as the disco-savvy Mr. Williams and John Saxon as the nonchalant Roper. Saxon formerly had a run of modest cowboy movies in Hollywood. Although far from being the greatest actor, his casual demeanor and well-rounded Americanized tone is befitting for this feature. Out of the three leads, Mr. Williams yields as the most dated character. His afro is about the diameter of a disco ball. Maybe I'm uninformed but after Enter the Dragon, I never heard of Jim Kelly again. Maybe he died out with the 70's. Although the plot is reminiscent of a typical James Bond outing and the characters are adequately overblown, there's nothing neither disappointing nor underwhelming about Enter the Dragon. Its hair-raising plot about drug infiltration, stylized kung fu and mixture of East and West cultures is ample entertainment to keep the viewer enthused about its finale. Quite honestly I haven't seen another kung fu film like it after its release. Bruce Lee's unexpected death could factor in to that. I suppose death of the \"dragon\" is the death of all kung fu movies. Now Enter Jackie Chan. PS. Chan is actually featured twice in the film as a stuntman who receives fatal blows from the master himself. Like Chuck Norris, Chan has Lee's legacy to thank for his current stardom.",

            "content": "It's commonly stated that Bruce Lee was a practicioner of Kung fu. To be accurate, that not true.He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is often credited with paving the way for modern mixed martial arts (MMA). His initial training as a youth was in Wing Chun, is a concept-based traditional Southern Chinese Kung fu (wushu) style and a form of self-defense, that requires quick arm movements and strong legs to defeat opponents. Softness via relaxation and performance of techniques in a relaxed manner is fundamental to Wing Chun. This style didn't suit Lee. Although he was very good at it. In 1959, Lee began teaching martial arts, calling his style Jun Fan Gung Fu, Bruce Lee's Kung Fu. It was Lee's approach to Wing Chun. Not long after, he incorporated Tae Kwan Do kicks into his style. By 1966, Lee came to believe that traditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalized to be practical in scenarios of chaotic street fighting, his speciality. Lee began developing a system with emphasis on practicality, flexibility, speed, and efficiency. He started to use different methods of training such as weight training for strength, running for endurance, stretching for flexibility, and many others which he constantly adapted, including fencing and basic boxing techniques, and he was influenced by heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali's footwork, which he studied and incorporated into his own style. Lee emphasized what he called 'the style of no style', which is what he says at the beginning of Enter the Dragon. This style consisted of eliminating the formalized approach that Lee argued was indicative of the traditional styles of martial arts. Lee felt that even the system he now called Jun Fan Gung Fu was too restrictive, and it eventually evolved into a philosophy and martial art he would come to call Jeet Kune Do or the Way of the Intercepting Fist, a term he would later regret because Jeet Kune Do implied specific parameters that styles connote, whereas the idea of his martial art was to exist outside of parameters and limitations. At the beginning of the film Lee expounds on his beliefs. They might seem like philosophical mumbo jumbo but it isn't. Lee explains his fighting theory in some detail and for anyone interested in martial arts it's a chance to understand why the man was such a great martial artist.",

Released in 1973, the film tells the story of Lee's character, a martial arts expert named Lee, who is recruited by British intelligence to infiltrate a secret tournament held on an island by a criminal mastermind named Han.What makes Enter the Dragon so special is the way it combines stunning martial arts action with an engrossing story and well-drawn characters. Lee's performance is electric, and the film's action sequences are expertly choreographed and executed. But beyond the martial arts, Enter the Dragon is a film that explores deeper themes of honor, loyalty, and the struggle between good and evil.In comparison to Enter the Dragon, the live-action film Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, released in 1990, feels like a much simpler and more lightweight affair. While both films feature martial arts action, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is primarily geared towards a younger audience, and its story and characters are more cartoonish and less fully realized.That's not to say that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles doesn't have its charms - it's a fun and entertaining movie that remains a nostalgic favorite for many. But in terms of pure filmmaking craft and storytelling, Enter the Dragon is a cut above. Its impact on the genre and its enduring popularity are a testament to the film's excellence, and it's a must-see for any fan of martial arts cinema.",

Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy it, but this film has the status of being one of the best martial arts movies ever made. Most influential, maybe, but I find that it has a few flaws. Let me explain... Bruce Lee and John Saxon put in great performances. The man who played Williams (sorry for not remembering his name!), however, is distractingly bad, and his character really serves no purpose. Neither does John Saxon's character, Roper, honestly. The stuntwork is great, but it's shot in a very inconsistent way. One thing that the Chinese Bruce Lee films all have in common is that they are all very well directed from an action standpoint. Big wideshots that allow us to see all the beautifully choreographed fight scenes. Robert Clouse tries to do that sometimes in this film, but he often ends up shooting his action in awkward mids and closeups. It's hard to enjoy the action when you can't see everything that's going on. That's why movies like the Bourne trilogy and the Taken sequels piss me off so much. Enter the Dragon would have benefited from a more Chinese inspired directing style.The climactic mirror room scene is amazing, and endlessly iconic. (John Wick: Chapter 2 homages it in its climactic shootout scene in the museum!) Overall, I think if the film had more consistently good action direction, and more of a focus on Bruce Lee's character - and less on the pointless side ones - Enter the Dragon would be worthy of the status it holds. As it is, it's still a pretty great action film, with several iconic moments.",

The dialogue is laugh-out-loud terrible, and most of the performances aren't great. Also, almost all of the audio appears to be ADRed, and some of the Chinese actor's voices where clearly redone by a white guy with a southern American accent who didn't even try to match the flaps. There are long pauses in between most lines of dialogue where we just stare at someone's face, which is hilarious. Most of the dialogue is pure nonsense and does nothing to further the plot. Watching this really made me understand why Samurai Cop exists--the dialogue is exactly the same quality (but much less racist).In my opinion, most of the fighting scenes were boring. This might be because I'm used to watching BJJ fights, which involve much more grappling, and so are a bit more dynamic than most of the fights, which just involve punching and kicking. Bruce Lee's fights stand out as the best by far, you can really see his skill. In some of the shots of the morning ritual, you can really see some of the extras phoning it in and not keeping proper form, which is funny.A lot of the stuff that happens in this movie makes no sense. Why use a king cobra instead of an armed guard? Are king cobras even indigenous to China? Why do all of the competitors and the guards randomly start fighting each other right before Bruce Lee fights the bad guy? What's the bad guys motive? Why did the bad guy lock a bunch of people in his evil underground lair? Wouldn't it just be really expensive to have to feed them all? Why are the only conversations that actually get anywhere about prostitutes? How did the agency who contacted Lee know that bad stuff was happening on this island? What did the agency even want Lee to do? Why did the bad guy kill the only man who knew who was in the garden? Why doesn't the side plot about one character's gambling addiction never get resolved? Actually, why isn't there any character development (unless you consider death a development)? Why does the bad guy literally let people beat each other to death in his tournament? Wouldn't that just attract the police? The film doesn't have a great portrayal of women, and the way the African-American character is just downright offensive. \"Funky\" music plays anytime he is on screen, he dies first, he's clearly supposed to be the comic relief of this movie.Ultimately, this is a hilaribad movie. The only thing that's really good about it is Bruce Lee, and he deserved to be in a much better movie. Don't be fooled by the high ratings, this is just a nostalgia trip for fans of martial arts movies or fans of Bruce Lee. If you're looking for something funny to watch with your friends, do a couple shots and this is your movie. If you're looking for a decent film, look elsewhere.And please, for the love of god, read the quotes on this website.

But if we translate literally the original name of the film and ponder more deeply, then \"The Dragon's Exit\" is a kind of hero of the beloved and inimitable Bruce Lee. And the dragon in this case is not the one to whom the island belongs, but of course - Lee.This picture was for me the first in a series of viewed films about the popularizer kung-fu and just an amazing person. For a long time, I did not attach much importance and attention to the personality of Bruce Lee and his films, nevertheless I considered myself a connoisseur of cinema and a fan of Chinese culture. Thanks to my good friend who advised me to watch the film \"Bodyguards and Killers\" with Donnie Yen, I fell in love with a series of biographical films about Ip Man. For some time, Donnie En was even an ideal martial artist for me, of course, until I met Bruce Lee. I continue to respect Donny's talent, but Bruce is just superior.Speaking of the movie. Not long ago, I watched Paul W. Anderson's Mortal Kombat. And while watching the Dragon Exit, the feeling of \"deja vu\" never left me. It's a shame only that I did the opposite, first I had to watch the original, and only then the sequel. Sorry for the cruelty, miserable sequel. As in any other case in the cinema, the original turned out to be much better, even surprised and interested. What got me hooked? Not the plot, unfortunately, but it is interesting in its own way. Interested in the game and behavior during the fights of Bruce Lee. He is spontaneous, independent, confident, firm and wise. Perhaps this is an echo of fame, because during the shooting, it was his huge. Nevertheless, Li Xiao Lun even beautifully \"Star Disease\".

But this movie set the standard for the genre, and opened the door for a host of real martial artists who became movie stars in their own right due to the warrior spirit and presence of Enter The Dragon's  charismatic star Bruce Lee.   This film will always remain THE icon for the Martial Arts Film genre.Prior to Enter The Dragon, martial arts films were haphazardly produced, with fight scenes that were poorly staged, and looking like a televised wrestling match.  Enter The Dragon pioneered new filming techniques for fight scenes, and offered movie goers martial arts confrontations choreographed by Lee that displayed the power, ferocity and simplistic beauty of his martial art...Jeet Kune Do.Even the script contained Jeet Kune Do theory.  The quote from the \"Master teaching Student\" scene with Mr. Lee and a student expresses one of the pillars of Jeet Kune Do thought.  \"It is like a finger pointing away to the moon, if you concentrate on the finger you will miss all that heavenly glory.\"This means that if a martial arts student blindly follows his instructor, the student will miss on ALL of the glory that the student can achieve from looking at the goal (the opponent).  A fighter must flow when in battle, \"Don't think, feel!!\" is another Jeet Kune Do principle expressed in the scene.  This means that a fighter should not think about what they are going to do, but to just do it, express it, execute.  Lee fostered the idea that mans strongest weapon is his ability to create, and this was so with fighting.  Lee felt that his style was to be \"shapeless, formless,\" contrary to the rigid traditionalism of martial arts masters before him.  And, he took techniques from many fighting styles from all over the world to make up his fighting theory.The story line to Enter The Dragon may have been simple, and by today's standards even crude, but it provided movie goers with the best martial arts ever portrayed on film.  Although there have been many martial arts films since \"Enter The Dragon,\" I hold this movie as my favorite of all time.  I can only imagine what level Bruce Lee could've taken the martial art film genre and his fighting style Jeet Kune Do had he lived to appreciate his work.",

They were so predictably one-sided and compared to all the fights choreographed by Jackie Chan, really slow paced. One just has to watch movies like the Police Story,Project A and Wheels On Meals to see that Chan is the real king of Kung Fu. Chans's fight with Benny 'The Jet' Urquidez in Wheels On Meals is so fast paced,competitive and realistic that it blows away anything Lee ever did in his movies and Let's not forget the climax excellent and brutal climax of Police Story.

The fight scenes were intense, and the imaginative scenes like the mirror scene made for really good suspense and creative shots. I think this film has aged well, despite the mediocre ADR and quality. The plot was very good and the camera angles were engaging throughout. I think Williams was killed instead of Roper because Williams was the 'clown' character in the movie, and killing him off created a more serious tone afterwards for the remaining part of the movie. A couple movies that played homage to this film are Kill Bill, and even Austin Powers (even though this was more of a parody, took elements from the film). This movie took from the James Bond movies in order to appeal to larger audiences using elements like the classic \"spy-movie\" music. All in all, pretty dang good movie.",

Williams was killed instead of Roper because Williams was involved in things that he had no reason to worry about. It added to the movie to kill him off. John Wick 2 and Kill Bill pay homage to Enter the Dragon. A film that steal from Enter the Dragon. This movie stole from the James Bond movies. It stole the sound effects and the action. Overall, I think this movie was interesting but I don't think I would have watched it on my own.",

            "content": "This is perhaps the most overrated of all martial arts films. It is so \"Hollywood\" it comes out as nothing more than \"Charlie Chan\" meets \"James Bond\", except Chan acknowledged and played on his humor and James Bond (with Sean Connery) had class and suavity. Bruce Lee showed to us he can't act, and neither can his co-stars: Saxon,Kelly,etc. The bad acting in this movie is really hard to watch. They hired B-grade actors to give this Hong Kong film a Hollywood feel and look,and succeeded with a grade C movie. Aside from the skillful fighting (which is so stylized and contrived anyways),the plot is silly and the situations are implausible. The level of violence in the movie is excessive--perhaps this accounts, sadly, for the film's enduring popularity. In most of his films, Lee always comes off looking like a kung-fu fighter with a severe psychopath problem. Was that always his intention, to look like a nut?? He actually makes Norman Bates look normal! 'Overkill with delight' is customary. Certainly, it is a film that should not be seen by children, despite the unbelievable 'PG' rating on some DVD versions. As a parent, I would not even allow a 15 year-old kid to watch this movie. No I am not a prude, but I dislike the glorification of violence and sex. And when you combine that with implausibility, third-rate acting, and a silly plot,the result is a movie that ranks,at most, at the top of the heap with all those other cheap martial arts films of the 70s. When people say that this movie broke new ground,the reality is that it broke new ground only because it was a tad better than other sensational chop-socketty movies. For me,\"The Chinese Connection\" was the best Lee film, not this one.",

This really only could have been made in a very specific time and place.It's sleazy, brainless, and the philosophical bent Bruce Lee brought to a few scenes feels a little contrived, but I have to admit practically every scene bursts with life; it's just beat after beat of good (or at least interesting) ideas.

The movie has all the trappings of a 1970's flick, so as time roars on, it shows it's age. 32 years later Mr. Kelly's afro and smooth approach to life are still entertaining as hell. How many lines can you repeat from this movie after all these years? (\"Boards, don't fight back!\", \"Mr. Han, suddenly I'd like to leave your island\",). Heck, who can watch the student instruction scene early in the movie and not laugh about \"all the heavenly glory\"... As for the world class fight scene underground on the island with the nunchuck sequence? Breathtaking...Long Live LEE!!",

Before that we see Bruce smiling, laughing, looking sad and looking bad. Not to mention a very thin plot. Other Bruce films are better than this, \"The Way of the Dragon\" and \"The Chinese Connection\" to name a few.To watch better and real action in kung fu flicks I suggest Jackie Chan earlier films such as \"Project A\" and \"Dragons Forever\".To label \"Enter the Dragon\" as the greatest kung fu movie is very misleading.",

Lee uses his invitation as cover against the eyes of Han, his henchman Bolo, and the army of fighters.

It is, however, fatally flawed.Don't get me wrong, I love the film: but there is one thing about it that leaves me cold...Why include some ageing Sean Connery look alike as a White Anglo Saxon Protestant lead? Roper can't perform martial arts for toffee, but he does looks a bit like Bond! Were the producers worried that audiences couldn't appreciate a film with an asian and a black as the heroes: or did their actual martial artist white man drop out at the last moment? This is akin to using David Carradine instead of Lee for Kung Fu. He can't act, he can't fight: but he does have a nice pale skin. I wonder if the same guy advised on the shading for the Lion King?Now that I'm in the mood after my big gripe, let's get picky, picky.Why not employ the odd extra who can actually punch properly for the mass \"army of martial artists\" scenes. Okay, so this is just a minor gripe: but they are all wearing black belts.Second, why introduce all those girls as the daughters of the evil bad guy, and also his best students, and then dump them from the film? Where was the scene when Daddy's girls fight Brucie to protect their old man?Basically, Bruce Lee makes this film. Take him out of it and you'd have something that even Sho Kusogi would be embarrassed to appear in (and that's saying something).One more thing: will they kindly stop cutting the damn thing when they show it on TV. Either show the film in all its glory (including nunchaku scenes) or don't show it at all. It's bad enough having Hero Turtles instead of Ninja ones but anyone who has ever used the old rice flails knows that, if you've never been trained in using them, the only person you are likely to hurt is yourself! Even after a couple of years of proper, professional training (ie kata after kata after kata after kata - and none of this freeform stuff) I still get lumps on the back of my head, or hit my funny bone with alarming regularity.God! They show kitchen knives being used to murder people. They show deliberate hit and run. They show guns. What is wrong with nunchaku?I have contribution to the conspiracy theories that abound about Lee's death: he saw into the future, he saw what they were going to do to his films, and just plain laid down and died!",
