            "content": "Fred Zinneman, the director, has put out some pretty low brow stuff, like \"High Noon,\" but it's all done with craftsmanship. This one is just about the opposite of \"High Noon,\" a thriller in which not a moment is wasted. Everything that happens is relevant to the plot and concise. Not only is the movie built around direct cuts from one scene to another distant one, the cuts are made on actions, sometimes actions that are only half completed. You have to keep your eyes open. If you blink at the wrong time, for instance, you're liable to miss the way Edward Fox gets hold of Per Lindquist's Danish passport.It's a battle of wits between the hired, cold-blooded assassin (Fox) who is out to kill Charles DeGaulle, and the team of French detectives and generals who are out to stop him. Fox eludes them with invention and foresight but detective in charge (Lonsdale) doggedly track him down. I don't suppose it's giving much away to reveal that Fox does not succeed in assassinating DeGaulle, since all interested parties must already know that DeGaulle died of a heart attack. (The headlines of the Philadelphia Examiner were unforgettable -- \"DeGaulle Keels Over,\" later amended to \"DeGaulle Drops Dead.\") The movie spells out the details by which Fox acquires his different identities and how and why he changes them. If you don't know how to get a false passport, watch this and find out. There are a lot of characters in this movie and a lot of locations but not once are we confused about what's happening or why. It's a splendid script. The acting is professional all around. David Hardwicke is tucked away in a small part. Michael Lonsdale as the detective has the proper proletarian face and modest demeanor. Fox has the necessary Saville Row certainty. And what a life he leads! Driving around the Riviera and the Maritime Alps in his sporty Alfa Romeo convertible, lodging in the finest hotels, boffing the elegant but foolish Delphine Seyrig, earning a cool half million for one job -- and this in the days when the dollar was worth something, murdering anyone who gets in his way. The kind of life any normal person would give an arm and a leg to lead.And it all goes down as smoothly as a draught of Pepto Bismol. There is only one brief exchange of gunfire at the end. There are no fist fights or assaults. Fox kills a couple of people in the course of his journey but they're all over quickly, sometimes off screen or in shadows. Nobody loses his or her temper. No one shouts at anyone else. The humor, and there ARE a few amusing moments, is subdued.If I were teaching a class in film appreciation I would show Zinneman's version back to back with the more recent \"The Jackal\" with Richard Gere and Bruce Willis. The final exam would consist of one question. \"Which did you prefer?\" Then I would flunk everybody who chose the later version.Bruce Willis changes his identity in a whimsical way. In every scene he seems to wear a different wig or something. Fox assumes only three false identities, an English tourist, a Danish schoolteacher, and a French veteran. And we understand precisely why he MUST change identities. Fox's murder weapon is a cleverly constructed .22 caliber rifle, a stark miniature. Willis's murder weapon is a gigantic cannon that looks capable of taking out a tank or maybe a battleship. Everything in the later film is both overblown and sloppy, a Gongoristic mess. Compared to the Willis/Gere film, Zinneman's \"High Noon\" was an exercise in sophistication. My God, what's happening to us?",

With nary a car chase or shoot out in sight, it manages to cram as much excitement into its running time as the entire BOURNE trilogy thanks to the combined wonder of expert direction and a faultless script. Highly detailed and never less than compelling, this film follows the exploits of a professional assassin about to embark on his biggest job yet \u2013 and we follow him every painstaking step of the way.Fox \u2013 entirely chilling and somehow commendable, despite his ultra ruthlessness \u2013 is a lead you almost (but not quite) want to win out come the end, purely because of his professionalism and his attention to detail. Michael Lonsdale works well as the detective cast opposite him, always human and likable, but the real winner is the script/directorial combo. Like SOUTHERN COMFORT, it's a film to keep you guessing until the final nail-biting moments and dare I say it, there's never a dull moment. An outstanding and exceptional piece of film-making.",

Handsomely photographed in some colorful European locations and impressively acted by the entire cast, it showcases EDWARD FOX as \"The Jackal\" in a performance of smooth villainy that is convincing all the way. The film's final thirty minutes are worth waiting for--as is The Jackal's final disguise that convinces the French authorities to let him pass. Fred Zinnemann keeps it all moving at a steady pace and there's never any letdown in suspense since the film has the power to draw you in from the start.Based on Frederick Forsyth's best-seller about the painful preparations an assassin makes in an attempt to take the life of Charles DeGaulle, it belongs in the same class with a film like THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, almost documentary in approach.The British cast is excellent with Michael Lonsdale doing an outstanding job as the relentless detective.

            "content": "Fred Zinnemann's excellent film, \"The Day of the Jackal,\" is the story of an attempted assassination of President Charles de Gaulle. The way the film unfolds, almost as a documentary, one would assume it's a true story. Actually, it's from Frederic Forsyth's novel.The Jackal (Edward Fox) is hired by the OAS, a militant underground group that opposes de Gaulle giving independence to Algeria. The group has learned the hard way that a man who survived -- in fact, led -- the Resistance in France during WW II is not easy to bump off. After shooting something like 110 bullets into his car, de Gaulle exited unscathed. So the OAS turns to an outsider, a crack assassin who carefully plans each step leading to de Gaulle's assassination. He is forced to think on his feet and kill a lot of people as unforeseen circumstances happen along the way.If the Jackal is working hard, so is the French Security. Due to bank robberies in France by the OAS, the French government figures that the OAS needs to fund something. The OAS chief is captured and tortured. Security walks away with the name: The Jackal, and realize that De Gaulle may be in danger. There is no way to find the Jackal: They can't detain him at the border since they don't know his name. Government assassins can't destroy him if he's in another country; they can't arrest him in France because they don't know who he is. The can't search for him; they don't know what he looks like. The government calls in a man recommended by the Police Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner Claude Lebel (Michael Lonsdale).With precious little to go on, made worse because the entire operation must be kept secret, Lebel and an assistant (a young Derek Jacobi) start the step by step police work necessary to uncover this man. It's a massive job.Absolutely fascinating film showing the careful preparations on the side of both the police and the assassin and the roadblocks each runs into. Edward Fox is brilliant as The Jackal -- even with precious little dialogue, he manages to show his coldness, preciseness, and quick mind. Lonsdale as Lebel seems like a real police detective - underplayed, exhausted, unflappable, and dogged. A wonderful performance.Truly excellent film.",

            "content": "You watch the Bruce Willis version of the Jackal and you think that is so cool, but you don't know cool until you see Edward Fox do it.Fox is the epitome of cool. The guy even wears an ascot, for god's sake! Most people today don't even know what an ascot is. He carefully plots his moves and is methodical in his precision. He kills with cool detachment. If he had Willis' assignment, he would have gotten it done.But, he had to deal with the European versions of the CIA/FBI and they were not restrained in how they handled investigations. With just a thread, the French police inspector carefully puts together a case with as much precision as his prey. It was a game of cat and mouse that kept you on the edge of your seat for two and a half hours without noticing the time.That is because of director Fred Zinnemann and the fact that he kept things moving along beautifully.If you want to see how a thriller is done with craft and cunning and without special effects, then this is the film for you.",

            "review_title": "Coldly efficient like it's central character",
            "content": "Much like the novel from which it was based on, The Day of the Jackal is a detailed, compelling and cold thriller. Frederick Forsyth has never been an author who imbues his characters with much humanity or depth; he is much more adept with presenting technical and political aspects in fine detail. This served him very well in the case of The Day of the Jackal, a novel that not only was detailed in these ways, but also was primarily about a cold calculated professional killer, whose lack of depth or real identity was actually a positive for the story. In other words this story was perfectly suited to Forsyth's style.For those who don't know, the film is set in 1963 and is about a French right-wing political group who want president Chares de Gaulle assassinated because of his decision to grant Algeria independence. They hire a professional killer with no ties to them to carry out the difficult task.Edward Fox plays the titular character with the requisite cold efficiency required. He is very much an anti-hero, as while he does murder some innocent people he is also the only figure in the film to really get behind. The French authorities are shown to not be slow to use brutal methods on their enemies themselves, while the two policemen assigned to the case are so lacking in charisma that it's just very hard to get behind them in their pursuit of the villain. If there is a fault with the film it must surely be that we as viewers are drawn to the Jackal and his against-all-odds mission - I think most people want him to succeed \u2013 and I'm not entirely sure this is what the film-makers actually intended.The period detail and French locations are lovely, so cinematically this is a very attractive looking film. It's well-paced and direct with no wastage. We never get into the Jackal character's head ourselves as viewers, there is a definite distance and we don't always immediately know why he does certain things. This only adds to the compelling voyeurism of watching him on his deadly mission. Despite the genre, there is a definite restraint shown in the depictions of violence. It's often implied or shown just off-screen. The focus of the film is very much on the way in which the assassin navigates through his mission via different methods of subterfuge. The film could not be further away in style from the laughable 90's remake The Jackal, a film that seems to do everything in an opposite way.The Day of the Jackal is overall an excellent political thriller that combines intelligence with a gripping narrative. It shows how this kind of material should be presented on screen, where less can absolutely be more. The way that it always stays within the realm of the plausible is one of its strongest suits too. All this combined with its enigmatic central villain make it a superlative film.",

Have my godparents to thank when watching it with them while holidaying with them, who could not believe me having not seen a film they hold in extremely high regard, and it turned out to be one of the finest films seen in quite some time.When it comes to crime drama thrillers 'The Day of the Jackal' is a perfect example of how to do them well and deserves every ounce of its acclaim and genre benchmark status. Actually have read the book and loved it, 'The Day of the Jackal' is a brilliant adaptation, being very faithful (not particularly common with film adaptations) with some logical changes. As has been indicated, it is even better as a standalone, one doesn't need to have read the book to love 'The Day of the Jackal'.'The Day of the Jackal' is a beautiful and stylish looking film, never being too glossy or picture postcard. The scenery is picturesque, making one want to tour around Europe, and the sometimes docudrama-like photography is both handsome and gritty. The music is never questionable in placement and fits well.Fred Zinnemann's direction is one of 'The Day of the Jackal's' greatest assets, his masterful and unmatched direction is some of his very best, always keeping the story absorbing while never rushing it. The magnificent script, very faithful to Forsyth's writing, provokes thought, is very intelligent, is educational and also entertaining more than once. The story has a good deal going on but doesn't get convoluted, similarly it has a deliberate pace that never drags thanks to the expertise of the script-writing, directing and acting as well as the slow-burning suspense.Really respected that the characters weren't genre clich\u00e9s in terms of character traits and that they were written with compelling realism. The acting is a large part of 'The Day of the Jackal's' success too, Edward Fox in the titular role gives a career-best turn, a smoothly chilling performance he gives, and Michael Lonsdale is especially outstanding of the faultless cast.Summing up, a brilliant film with everything working so magnificently (especially the acting, script and direction) that the somewhat anti-climactic ending for me was easy to ignore. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

OAS was a terrorist group formed by French vets of the War of Argelia and committing terrorist acts preferentially after its independence (Evian,1962). The Minister (Alan Badel) assigns the mission to locate Jackal , being appointed his best investigator named Lebel( Michael Lonsdale) and assisted by his helper (Derek Jacobi). The film develops the preparation of the assassination including identity forge, weapons purchase, among others.This is an interesting thriller lavishly produced by John Woolf who after that he made \u00a8Odessa file\u00a8 also by Frederick Forsyth. It's full of action, tense, high intrigue and is very entertaining. From the beginning to the end the tension and suspense is continued . In spite of the fact that the runtime is overlong, is neither tiring , nor dull , but thrilling . Cool performance by Edward Fox as elegant and cunning murderer.

            "content": "Frederick Forsyth is the imaginative author behind this suspenseful and riveting tale concerning the attempt on the life of the Former President of France, Charles de Gaulle. From first to last, the director has embed this dramatic film with the believability of actual fact. Years ago, during his tenure as President of the Republic of France, De Gaulle gave Algeria its Independence. French army veterans felt betrayed by him and the government decide to assassinate him. There were several attempts, all of which were either botched or failed miserably. Thus the basis for this movie. \" The Day of the Jackal \" is the story of a secret group of retired Agerian officers called the O.A.S. who promised to kill de Gaulle, opt to hire an expert assassin to carry out the deed. That man is an Englishman, Paul Duggan, (Edward Fox) who is given the code name 'The Jackal'. He is a professional marksman with a perfect record of assassinations around the world. Aware that OAS officers want de Gaulle dead, the French police put a 24 hour surveillance on them. They capture and torture one courier who reveals the new attempt and discover the contract killer is little more than a ghost. Nevertheless, they hire the best detective in all of France, Commissioner Claude Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) to discover the identify of the killer before he kills the president. Derek Jacobi plays Caron his assistant and both men have the impossible task of finding a nearly invisible man. While the police are informed of his task, they do not know much else and therefore allow the Jackal to find a perfect location for the deed. Once in place the assassin waits for his target, who is precisely on time and only a few seconds separates the two cops from their quarry. The entire film is well paced as is the storyline. The acting is superb and contains some well known actors like Cyril Cusack as The Gunsmith, Alan Badel, Tony Britton, Adrien Cayla-Legrand as The President and Maurice Denham as General Colbert. It is easy to recommend this film and the selection of Edward Fox was a stroke of genius. ****",

            "content": "If there were an award for sheer single-mindedness, this film would win a lifetime- achievement. I don't think I've seen a movie more dedicated to following through on its premise. With near excruciating detail, the two and a-half hour narrative follows out a plot to assassinate French president Charles de Gaulle by disgruntled Algerian colonialists who hire a professional hit man known as the Jackal.Now you might think 140-minutes would provide plenty of critical material to write about. But, in my little book, the sum-total doesn't. Instead, the screenplay consists entirely of following out the tactics of police pursuit and criminal evasion, producing results that are, nevertheless, riveting as heck. That's mainly because the screenplay shows the Jackal's painstaking preparation, though much is done in silence such that we don't know why he's doing what he's doing. We find out, however, as the chase unfolds and he puts those preparations into practice, allowing him to stay one-step ahead of the police pursuers. It amounts to an exquisite game of cat and mouse, and is about as well played as any thriller I've seen. But you have to stay alert since the Jackal operates mainly in silence.If there's a downside, it's probably some seemingly pointless interludes where police functionaries walk along corridors to somewhere. I'm guessing these were included to give us a taste of the richly ornate interiors of high government offices since the walking itself doesn't advance the single-minded plot. Still, these scenes, along with the many sunny outdoor shots, do lend an eye-catching background to all the maneuvering.Anyway, between the expert screenplay, fine acting, and colorful European locales, the movie is richly deserving of its first-rate reputation.",

            "content": "1963, France. French President Charles De Gaulle (Adrien Cayla-Legrand) has decided, after a popular referendum, to allow the North African nation of Algeria independence from France. This action leads to the death of hundreds of French residence in Algeria and bloody conflict which extends to Europe, as disgruntled French army officers form the OAS, a terrorist group which strives to assassinate De Gaulle. After a failed attempt on the President's life, the leaders of the OAS are tried and executed, and the organization is in tatters. The surviving leaders of the OAS hire a professional assassin (Edward Fox), codenamed the Jackal, to assassinate De Gaulle. Using a bewildering array of disguises, false passports, and other tricks, the Jackal works his way through Europe, being tracked by a frantic French bureaucracy led by milquetoast Police Commissioner Lebel (Michael Lonsdale). It's up to Lebel to find and stop the Jackal before August 25th, Liberation Day, when the assassin will make his move.Based on the gripping if very long novel by Frederick Forsyth, Fred Zinneman's \"Day of the Jackal\" is one of the best of its genre. It succeeds largely because, as Roger Ebert said, \"it knows exactly what it's talking about\". Though fictional, the film's look and feel gives it an air of authenticity that few, if any, other thrillers could hope to match. The film has an almost documentary air about it, which is one of the major reasons it is so successful.Much of the credit is due to director Fred Zinneman. Despite having a lengthy career making such classics as \"High Noon\", \"From Here to Eternity\", and \"A Man for All Seasons\", Zinneman is generally overlooked when it comes to great directors. Certainly, it's understandable why. Zinneman's films typically do not contain much in the way of flair or flash, at least when it comes to photography. Zinneman's direction is straightforward, unpretentious, with no fancy camera angles: he allows the script, sets, actors, and action on screen to do the work. This might not be the accomplished method of film making, but it works wonders in Zinneman's best films, particularly here. The lack of stylization creates the aforementioned feel that this story could happen in real life.Other elements contribute to the film's success. The lengthy, in-depth, and almost labyrinthine source novel is reduced by screenwriter Kenneth Ross into succinct, economic dialog which conveys as much information with as little verbiage as possible. Georges Delerue's score functions much the same as his work in Zinneman's \"A Man for All Seasons\". There is little actual music, other than diegetic music from marching bands or street musicians, which adds immeasurably the look and feel of the movie.What makes or breaks the film, however, is the cast, and this film is truly unique in its acting. The film recruits a huge, very talented cast of actors from both sides of the English Channel, and every performance is wonderfully understated, free of histrionics or theatricality, which makes the film all the more believable.Edward Fox is marvelous in the title role. He plays the assassin as the ultimate detached professional; unconcerned about politics or individuals, he simply does his job and does it well. He can be counted on for results. He is neither arrogant nor cocky, just an expert who knows what he's doing and will go any length to achieve it. Fox is completely, utterly, and chillingly believable as the Jackal, and one is torn between rooting for him to succeed or for him to get caught.Also fantastic is the Jackal's nemesis, Commissioner Lebel, who is played in an equally understated performance by Michael Lonsdale. Lebel is not an action hero, nor particularly exciting; he is a no-frills, straightforward police inspector who uses his brains, intuition, skill, and more than a bit of luck to track down the Jackal. Lonsdale and Fox give two of the most utterly believable performances ever captured on film, a testament to both actors.The rest of the cast follows suit, although few of the other characters have as much screen time. Cyril Cusack plays the charming gunsmith who builds the Jackal's perfect weapon; Delphine Seyrig is a middle-aged Frenchwoman who begins an ill-advised affair with the assassin; Derek Jacobi is Lebel's dedicated assistant; Tony Britton as the crusty Scotland Yard investigator who gives Lebel his first break in the case; Jean Martin and Eric Porter play the desperate OAS members forced to hire an outsider to do their dirty work. These are just a few of the many fine performers in the film, and all give well-rounded, believable performances.\"The Day of the Jackal\" is a brilliant thriller that still holds up well almost 35 years later. By capturing the essence of 1960's France, and by creating a completely believable atmosphere, Zinneman draws the viewer into the film. It is unlikely that the viewer will be able to lose interest as the plot moves along. A brilliant thriller, and a masterpiece for all time.9/10",

            "content": "This is not a true story. It is a fictional account of what could, in theory, have happened following the August 22, 1962, real life assassination attempt by the OAS terrorist group, on the life of French President Charles De Gaulle. In the film, the OAS tries again, this time using a simpler plan, one involving a lone gunman, a professional killer who calls himself ... the jackal (Edward Fox). The jackal is the archetype of the modern political sniper. The screenplay and Fox's performance present him as suave, sophisticated, intelligent, resourceful, and methodical. He is a risk taker. All of which makes him extremely dangerous, because he has no moral scruples.We watch the jackal as he prepares meticulously for his assignment. As the clock ticks toward the moment of kill, the plot alternates between the jackal's daily logistics and the frantic efforts of Detective Lebel (Michael Lonsdale), hot on the jackal's trail, but always one step behind him. Kenneth Ross' efficient screenplay and Fred Zinnemann's expert direction create a film with steadily building suspense.In lieu of unnecessary background music, sound effects engender a sense of realism and immediacy. The ticking of a clock, the sound of footsteps, or doors opening and closing, help to place the viewer in the scene, as a silent partner. The use of echoes further heightens the already elevated suspense. And adroit cinematography creates menacing visuals, characterized by dark backgrounds, creepy overhead lights, and noirish shadows. Augmenting all of this, the film's minimal dialogue, attention to detail in production design and costumes, the excellent acting, and the brilliant editing seal the film's deserved reputation as a film of unusually high technical quality. The overall result for the viewer is a truly suspenseful and realistic story not easily forgotten.My only significant complaint is the film's strange climax. I personally found it to be elliptically counterintuitive. Notwithstanding this, \"The Day Of The Jackal\" deserves a very high recommendation for viewers wanting to see a political thriller along the lines of \"Three Days Of The Condor\" or \"The Parallax View\".",

            "content": "Some movies just ooze with class and \"The day of the Jackal\" is an example of such a film. It's one of those movies that you never seem to get bored watching. Even if you know what's going to happen and the the thrill and tension is taken out, it's still a fascinating watch. The documentary style format and no music score (which is so important in many movies) does not in any way detract from the atmosphere that is created by Zinnerman.The casting of Edward Fox was a crucial decision because he was believable as the Jackal who effortlessly portrays himself as very thorough, cool, methodical, professional assassin who is never flustered. Yet he is also a ruthless cold blooded killer who has no problem disposing with anybody who appears to get in his way, might compromise his cover or is simply just in the wrong place at the wrong time - - - you see it's nothing personal! From the slimy forger right up to the French police officer at the end I counted five murders ( I'm presuming the old woman he karate chopped at the end was killed).In addition he does not appear threatening nor intimidating to anybody, he just blends and does not draw attention to himself.This would explain why he is able to take people into is confidence. (unlike Bruce Willis who has assassin written all over his face in the 1997 version). The Jackal looks relaxed and classy as Caltrop, an irritated tourist as Duggan, a nervous limp wrist-ed school teacher from Denmark and a very tired WWW I cripple. All of them are believable characters which he plays during the film and none of them look like assassins.The movie moves at a good pace and in all honesty defies it's two and half hour status, the atmosphere is created by the back ground noise of the environment not the music score and of course that changes from England, France and Italy which of course provides great cinematography throughout the movie.The support cast are also very good in their respective roles but particular praise has to go to the Jackals arch nemesis Lebel played by Michael Lonsdale ( who was Drax in the Bond Movie Moonraker) who despite some near misses and some gut wrenching setbacks eventually corners the Jackal. He is not fooled by a war veteran who appears to be a cripple. This is an interesting point because what the movie does well is show how difficult it was for a lone assassin to elude various agencies and law enforcement authorities from interpol when the word is out to apprehend him. This would be particularly prevalent in post WWW II France and continental Europe where identity papers are compulsory and the power of the state far more intrusive than in other countries. Today with Email, cell phones, internet, satellite surveillance and CCTV cameras which are everywhere today it would make the work of the jackal that much harder to pull off.The Jackal had a chance to bail out when the mission was compromised but decided to push on despite knowing that the odds were increasingly being stacked against him. ( In theory he did pull it off, if he had not been careless with his shot on DeGaulle, although he would not have got away). Lastly, the ending had a nice touch , the viewer did not know who the Jackal was, he was not Caltrop, the irate flat owner at the end, he certainly was not Duggan we knew that \u0097 where did he come from? He was laid to rest in an unmarked paupers grave. A mystery for the viewer at the end!",

            "content": "On 22 August, 1962, gun men tried to assassinate Charles DeGaulle. A group of ex-army officers called the OAS wanted him dead for giving Algeria its independence. When this attempt failed, the leaders scattered into hiding and hired the best assassin they could find, a character played by Edward Fox in his breakout role. He received half his money down and began his planning. Eventually, the French authorities got a whiff of this and had Interior's best detective, played by Michael Lonsdale, try to track him down and thwart him, with no idea of what he looked like, what his plans were, or who he might be.It's based on the novel by Frederick Forsyth, and as directed by Fred Zinnemann, it is at the top of my list for political thrillers. That list is cluttered with films in which the hero stretches himself and breaks the rules because some one he cares about is threatened: a wife, a child, a dog. This one is no such thing. It is about top professionals doing their work because it is their job, and the reason they have the job to do is because they do good work. It turns into a surprisingly suspenseful game between the elegant, blank Fox, and the clownlike Lonsdale, as they go about their work. We know that DeGaulle was not killed. We know he died in November of 1970 of a burst blood vessel. Even so, while I look at this movie, it seems as if it's taking place in an alternative universe, and DeGaulle might be killed, his head exploding like a watermelon with a bullet shot by Fox.It is the calmness, deliberation, and speed at which he walks, that makes Fox such a threatening figure. He always seems to know exactly what he is doing, whether he is buying hair dye and moving it into cologne bottles, testing the gun he has had made, or killing the forger who attempts to blackmail him, perhaps because it offends his sense of professionalism. But that is the only thing we ever learn about him. At times he seems to be a heterosexual, at others, a homosexual. He is equally facile at being English, Danish, and French. In the end he is simply what he does, a professional assassin and nothing more. That lack of content, of character, after spending most of more than two hours with him, is the most disturbing thing about him.We know little more about Lonsdale. He's married, or living with a woman, and he breaks all the rules to get his job done, because it's his job to do. Does he have any opinion on DeGaulle? We don't know. He is as ruthless as Fox. Convinced that someone in the Cabinet is leaking information about his investigation, he finds out who did it by tapping a minister's phone. When asked how he knew which phone to tap, he says he didn't; he had them all tapped. It's supremely logical, yet clearly risky. Everyone else in this movie is affected by their emotions, their fears, their lusts. In the end, it is up to Lonsdale, and Lonsdale alone, to stop the Jackal. Only he can do it, because he doesn't care. He is a professional, doing his job, just like the Jackal, he will use any means to get it done.This movie was not a hit when it came out. There is not one performer in it that most movie-goers would have heard of. The producer wanted a star for the Jackal. Zinnemann didn't. He wanted someone who would be anonymous, chose Fox and was satisfied with the movie. Zinnemann was like that, an anti-auteur who served the movie he was making, and wound up with four Oscars.The story is told that after he made his last movie, he took some time off, then came back to one of the studios to talk about his next project. He met with a young executive, who seemed very genial. \"So, Mr. Zinnemann,\" the youngster asked, \"Tell me: what have you done?\" Zinnemann looked at him and said \"You first.\" He never made another movie.Zinnemann always denied the story, claiming he thought Billy Wilder had told it about himself. He made the last of his 25 features over 52 years in 1982, and lived to be 89 in 1997. Along the way, he made some great movies, including this one.",

I was comparing and contrasting this with the original \"The Manchurian Candidate,\" both films dealing with assassination, but taking totally different paths -- one with a brainwashed assassin, the other with a coolly professional one. But in comparing this film with more-modern films -- including the remake of this one -- it's amazing how everyone involved 30 or 40 years ago used dialog, character development, fantastic cinematography and other such tools to craft an incredibly complex and tense work. You might have trouble remembering one actor from this film, but you can't forget their characterizations. Nowadays, it's nothing but special effects.

Although the movie runs no less than 143 minutes, the direction and film editing (Ralph Kemplen) are so crisp, there is not a moment that fails to hold suspense. The screenplay by Kenneth Ross (whose writing career in movies is remarkably sparse - Brother Sun Sister Moon, The Odessa File, Black Sunday, and The Fourth War were his only other titles up to 1973) - is a model in the art of storytelling.The superbly lensed location photography by Jean Tournier also adds immeasurably to the overwhelming sense of inexorable reality.",

            "content": "\"The Day of the Jackal\" is one of the best films of the 1970s. However, oddly, it was only nominated for one Oscar--for film editing. Perhaps this film was one that just slipped under the radar or maybe the competition was just too stiff that year, all I know is that is one of the great suspense films.The story is set amidst the tumult of the French losing Tunisia and Algeria. In the 1950s and 60s, nationalists in these two North African countries began fighting the French government for their independence. However, most Frenchmen thought of this land less as colonies and more as part of France itself--and these folks were determined to fight long and hard to keep these lands. As for the French government, they fought hard to keep this land but eventually realized it was an unwinnable war and looked to bring the troops back to the mainland. And, the extreme elements within France saw this as a betrayal. In fact, one group was so upset that they plotted to kill their leader, President Charles de Gaulle. This film is specifically about an assassin, known as 'the Jackal', in his plan to carry off the assassination. What makes this a great film is that the assassin is a cold, calculating and brutal man--played by a rather nondescript but very convincing Edward Fox. In fact, the portrayal is so riveting and convincing, you can't help but getting sucked into this film so expertly directed by Fred Zinnemann. See this one.",

And after the last attempt on DeGaulle went undone, an  Englishman who is only known as the Jackal (Edward Fox) is hired to finish the job even though he wants to do it his way.Once the word gets out, a noble Paris detective, Claude Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) is chosen by his superiors to apprehend the Jackal before he can pull off the assassination.The movie is based on the novel written by Frederick Forsyth (\"The Dogs of War\", \"The Fourth Protocol\") and the adaption made by Kenneth Ross is remarkably accurate and retains mostly of the mind-numbing suspense.\nWell-known director Fred Zinnenmen (the original \"High Noon\" and \"From Here to Eternity\") handles the film like a picture frame, keeping it clean and avoiding any of the typical Hollywood methods, especially the climax.

            "content": "This movie turned up on TCM last night and I found it to be outstanding. The movie has a very handsome look with terrific shots of Paris and Italy. The lead actors, Edward Fox and Michael Lonsdale, are actors that are rarely seen by American audiences which I thought helped the viewer really get into the suspense of the film.  This is unquestionably Edward Fox's most memorable performance.The movie is extremely suspenseful even though the viewer knows that the Jackel will not be able to assassinate Charles de Gaulle.  While there were several assassination attempts against de Gaulle, he survived them all, so you know the Jackel will fail.  Even though you know that, it is fascinating to see the Jackel assemble his false identities, his weapon, his forged papers as he methodically and dispassionately goes about his trade as the world's finest assassin.  Michael Lonsdale is also outstanding as the premier French detective who is given carte blanche by the government to hunt down the Jackel by any means necessary.  The movie is set in 1963 and so it is a bit jarring to listen to the cops talk about how they will be getting a copy of the Jackel's fake passport that evening as it is flown to them from Britain---how did they get along without faxes and computers?  Given the tenor of our times with every sensible nation turning things upside down to find terrorists, it is interesting to see how authorities try to stop an assassin forty years ago. \nThroughout the movie the Jackel remains an enigma.  Other than getting a ton of money, we have no idea why he's an assassin.  The Jackel also takes some extraordinary risks---taking time to seduce a Frenchwoman while he knows the cops are hot on his trail and then going back to her only to murder her after she reveals to him that the cops have already approached her about him.  Then, even though he has half the fee already in the bank, the Jackel continues on with the assignment even though he could easily back out of it. Knowing that the police are searching every hotel in Paris, he brilliantly goes to ground by going to a gay bathhouse and spending the night at a man's apartment.  Is the Jackel bisexual, gay or is he simply doing what is necessary to stay out of sight?  This is a terrific movie all around and very superior to more recent suspense movies.",

When he appeared on the B.B.C.'s 'Question Time' some years back, he came across as a stuffy, right-wing Colonel from 1935 who's travelled forward in time and hates everything he sees. My dislike of him as a person does not colour my view of him as an author;'The Day Of The Jackal' is one of the finest British post-war thrillers.It tells how a group of extremists, mostly drawn from the French army, band together to form the O.A.S., dedicated to killing President Charles De Gaulle as revenge for his making Algeria independent. Riddled with informers, and with the authorities closing in on them, they decide to recruit from outside; an unnamed Englishman ( Edward Fox ) calling himself 'The Jackal'. He agrees to kill De Gaulle but only for a fee large enough for him to retire on. They agree. As the Jackal puts his plan into operation, the police - led by Inspector Lebec ( Michael Lonsdale ) - commences a manhunt across Europe...The book was surprisingly turned down by almost every major publisher before seeing the light of print. They probably thought that as De Gaulle had only recently died ( 1969 ) in real life, the book was of no value as a suspense thriller. They were wrong. The film, directed by Fred Zimmermann, begins excitingly with a failed O.A.S. operation and never lets up. Hitchcock could not have done better. Fox is superb as the mysterious killer ( he can kill using his bare hands ), jumping around the continent under various identities, at all times one step ahead of his pursuers. The scene where he practises shooting in the woods I could watch all day. The actor was not as well known then as now, giving his performance added credibility. Had they used someone famous, I think it would have negated the suspense somewhat ( this happened in the 1997 remake, which had Bruce Willis as 'The Jackal' ).The wonderful supporting cast includes Anton Rodgers, Donald Sinden, Terence Alexander, Cyril Cusack, Barrie Ingham, Alan Badel and Ronald Pickup. Delphine Seyrig ( of 'Last Year at Marienbad' ) plays a rich woman the Jackal seduces while staying at a hotel.The film was a critical and commercial success. A year later, Forsyth's 'The Odessa File' was brought to the big screen ( starring Jon Voight ), but failed to replicate its success. A number of books in similar vein duly appeared on bookshelves, clearly inspired by the 'Jackal', most notably Jack Higgins' ( a.k.a. Harry Patterson ) 'The Eagle Has Landed' ( about a wartime plot to kill Churchill ).",

            "content": "One of the most remarkable men of the last century in my humble opinion was Charles DeGaulle of France. When I was eleven years old he came out of retirement and established the Fifth Republic of France which has survived to the present. I remember as a kid and an adolescent some of the tantrums on the international stage he would throw and be a general pain to Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson.But later on I read a biography of him and clear as a bell I remember what he said about how he saw his role in World War II. \"In me you see the honor of France\" was the quote. And I thought about it and by God it was true. True for him more than anyone else I could think of. At a time when his country was conquered, when so many more senior military officials either became outright collaborators with their new masters or just played for time to see which way the wind blew, this man would not yield. He was a junior one star brigadier general and when everyone above him yielded, he did not. He and the Free French who served with him carried the honor of their country. Maybe in our history that could only be claimed about George Washington.So only a man of DeGaulle's stature could have gotten France out of the colonial entanglements of her past. Especially Algeria across the Mediterranean who some viewed as part of France. The disgruntled French who had to leave Algeria, mostly army and colonial officials formed an extremist organization called the OAS and made a few attempts to assassinate DeGaulle. The Day Of The Jackal is a novel version of one of those attempts.As we know Charles DeGaulle gave up the Presidency of the Fifth Republic in 1969 and died a year later. Still Fred Zinnemann with no real box office names in his cast of players made one of the best films of the Seventies and one of the best thrillers of all time. Remarkable when you know what the outcome will be.French Intelligence gets a hold of the plot that a lone contract killer called 'The Jackal' has been hired by the OAS who can no longer trust their own network as it has been so compromised to kill DeGaulle. The killer they hire is Edward Fox, an Englishman who is thorough and meticulous in his preparations and as cold as the climate the penguins live in. When the French pick up on him, he manages to elude them a couple of times. He kills three people in his trip to Paris, necessary for him to complete his mission. Among Fox's dead are a woman he picked up during a hotel stay just so he can get her car as his has been spotted. Another is a gay man whom he picked up in a bathhouse in Paris who gave him shelter and then heard the French police were looking for him. The third was a forger who tried to hold him up for more money.Fox even has a weapon especially designed for him to conceal as he goes across the border. I won't say more, but you have to see the weapon he designs for himself. Alan Badel who plays the French Minister of the Interior assigns his own deputy Michael Lonsdale as the man to track down and apprehend the Jackal, dead or alive. Lonsdale who doesn't appear in the film until about a third of the way through is a tireless and dogged adversary who also has to deal with an informant in his own department as the OAS has planted a woman with one of the senior officials to Badel as a mistress/spy. Playing Lonsdale's assistant in an early role is Derek Jacobi.The Day Of The Jackal is at the top of the list in suspense movies. Alfred Hitchcock could not have fashioned suspense and terror any better than Zinnemann does here. Do not miss this film if it ever broadcast.And this review is dedicated to Charles DeGaulle who carried the honor of his country on his very tall frame.",

Almost completely devoid of dialogue the scenes portray visually more story than most modern thrillers can fit into two hours. This is about the best book-to-film conversion I've ever seen. The cuts, where they are made, are logical and some locations are combined. From Forsyth's first, and probably best book (written in less than 5 weeks) this film contains nothing that does not drive the story forward. The character of the Jackal is brilliantly finely drawn. He doesn't contain any of the cliches that you would expect to see in a film written in the last twenty years (he doesn't display mental instability, or have flashbacks to some event in his past). He never tries to justify his pernicious occupation to anyone yet, strangely, doesn't come across as an evil man. Simply as a professional doing his job. The French police inspector is wonderfully underplayed and is as far away from the he-breaks-the-rules-but-he-gets-the-job-done cliche as you can possibly imagine. He is first seen attending to his pigeons and upon being told he is being put on the case simply says \"Oh God...\"....Zimmemann's direction is great and the scenes are beautifully photographed - particularly in Paris.This is an all-time great film.

The film is tense and the tension never goes away but that doesn't mean that things are rushed. I wouldn't call the film heart pounding but it certainly does hold your attention. The characters don't make any stupid or illogical decisions but everybody (both the Jackal and the police who are trying to get him) act professionally with every move having been calculated beforehand. We see how the killer prepares for his job, the intricate technical details of what go into such a thing. A very interesting thing to see instead of simply rushing past those things to focus mainly on action scenes.Edward Fox makes for a great Jackal. He is a focused professional who always knows what he is doing. The French police somehow find out that an attempt will be made on De Gaulle's life so they begin a desperate search for the culprit.Director Fred Zimmerman is the man who brings all these elements together and weaves them into a solid film that holds up to this day.

But it's bracingly sharp in its direction, in its photography, in its remarkably efficient editing. There is something perfect about the construction, and the final complexities made transparent.I read the book many years ago and was riveted at the time. I think it's what we now call an airport novel, but it was well written (by Fred Forsyth) and the plot about an assassin out to kill the president had an urgency that made sense, even to a young American. The precision of the main character in his effort to get close enough to his target to actually shoot him dead was memorable. And it transfers perfectly here.Director Fred Zinnemann is no stranger to great movies. \"High Noon\" is likewise a perfectly constructed film and is studied for it, and \"From Here to Eternity\" has taken on its own kind of legendary status.What \"Jackal\" lacks is something to feel for, some bit of warmth, or a sense of wanting what is right to happen. Because it's a cold movie where the main character is officially the antagonist. He's cunning and cruel, and we never learn why, there is no psychology involved, just an acting out of smart murderous professionalism. It's almost like this very Old Hollywood director has shifted to the post-1967 New Hollywood mode of upending expectations, and so here we spend almost every minute with the assassin, and are meant to identify with him.And want him to succeed. You see, we are meant to want the President of France to get shot in the head from long distance by a single exploding bullet.Well, you'll have to see how it plays out. There is an ostensibly positive side, a French official in charge of finding and stopping this assassin, and we are given time with his efforts. I don't know if it's on purpose, but these scenes, which are scarce at first but which multiply by the end, are relatively drab. We kind of want him to succeed, too, but not more than the other guy. We put up with his mustachioed relevance as a kind a caricature. The assassin is far more suave, good looking, and frankly smart, the loner against the system, the one I, as the loner in the audience, am committed to.Give yourself a good block of time for this because once you start you are unlikely to want to stop.

            "content": "There's always something fascinating about a film that takes a well-known historical event and twists a fictional story around it. Not only does it effectively add a true sense of realism, thus increasing the suspense and visceral intensity of the plot, but there's also that inkling of a feeling that perhaps the story isn't fictional, after all. It goes against all our logic, but the sentiment still sits at the back of our minds; as far as we know, maybe there was an assassination attempt on Charles de Gaulle on August 25, 1963 that was promptly covered up by authorities. Of course, Fred Zinnemann's 'The Day of the Jackal (1973),' based upon the acclaimed 1971 thriller novel by Frederick Forsyth, never purports to be telling a true story, but it remains a exciting consideration. The film follows a cunning, ruthless assassin \u0096 codenamed the Jackal \u0096 as he plots to sniper the French President, as well as the frantic attempts of authorities to capture the anonymous man before he can carry out his plans.Unlike most thrillers concerned with capturing a killer before he can strike, 'The Day of the Jackal' spends most of its time with the assassin himself, where we watch him intelligently and artfully drawing his meticulous plans and putting them into execution. The Jackal (Edward Fox) is a man of few words; a silent and scrupulous professional who never allows emotion to affect his work. We come to recognise his sly brilliance in everything he does, and yet the film never celebrates his cleverness, and admiration is not an emotion with which we are willing to respond to him. On the opposite side of the moral scale is Deputy Commissioner Claude Lebel (Michael Lonsdale), a shy and softly-spoken detective who reveals himself to be a surprisingly cunning and resourceful investigator. The means by which he and his colleagues break-down the Jackal's impenetrable scheme is genuinely captivating and intriguing.Given the story's historical grounding, it is inevitable that the assassination attempt be unsuccessful, though Zinnemann manages to infuse the story with a continuing air of suspense, which slowly escalates as the fateful day \u0096 Liberation Day in Paris \u0096 approaches. 'The Day of the Jackal' joins the ranks of such films as 'All the President's Men (1976)' and 'Zodiac (2007),' which somehow manage to maintain the tension despite their conclusions never being in any doubt {though, admittedly, those two had the added burden of a completely factual story}. Despite the phenomenal success of Forsyth's novel, the film adaptation was a box office failure, which Zinnemann later blamed upon having an unknown in the title role. Nevertheless, 'The Day of the Jackal' is now considered a classic thriller, which also spawned an average 1997 remake, 'The Jackal,' starring Bruce Willis and Richard Gere.",

            "content": "Back in August 1962, France faced a major crisis as army members, opposed to the decision by De Gaulle to grant Independence to Algeria banded together into the OAS and sought to kill De Gaulle. Following their failed attempt in the Paris Suburb of Petit Clamart (very faithfully recreated in the film) this film asks the question, what if the OAS tried again with a professional assassin? Casting Edward Fox as the assassin, codenamed Jackal is probably one of the best decision in film history. He doesn't look dangerous and even for someone like me who abhors guns and violence, it's hard not to admire his coolness and professionalism. The film turns into a deadly game of cat and mouse when the French authorities learn of the plot but not wanting to create a panic, only one man, Comissioner Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) is given permission to find him. Lebel in many ways is similar to the Jackal, he doesn't look like your average cop but he is incredibly professional and diligent.The film sticks faithfully to the early 1960s and is shot very stylishly, going to the real locations from Genoa, the French Rivieria and Paris. Zinneman's direction is also very precise, everything you see on screen has a meaning, nothing is superfluous and although it's fairly long, the film builds gradually to a climax rather than jumping in.Please don't even consider the terrible 1997 remake, stick with the original and enjoy",

            "content": "With the growing impatience of the modern film-goer, it's no wonder people can't watch this film today. It's long. There's no music. People don't talk enough. The violence isn't bloody. The photography is very boring. The ending sucked. These were just a few of the complaints that I received upon screening this to about 50 high school students at a recent film club meeting. It was my week to show a movie, and I wondered how people might respond to this. Well, we started with 50, and by the end, there were about 7 kids left. Allow me to explain.This film, has a very specific look and feel for its time. Set in the early sixties, we follow a fictionalized account of an assassination attempt on the life of Charles De Gaul. The OAR, a conservative underground movement angry about De Gaul's ending of the war in Algeria, decides they must take back power. Ultimately, almost all of their attempts have failed, so in desperation, the OAS decides to hire an outside assassin to eliminate De Gaul. At the time, this scared viewers, the thought of controlling and altering government, through illegal action. In a way, it's comparable to Grisham's Runaway Jury, in the sense that the law has few boundaries when change is wanted. The OAS hires the Jackal, played with dry cool by Edward Fox, an amazing underground assassin, with a reputation preceding him, even if he isn't supposed to exist. Now, in accordance with the IMDb's rules concerning spoilers and revealing the ending, I won't divulge much in the ways of plot, but I must say, this is an excellently crafted piece of political thriller. From the novel by Frederick Forsyth, and scripted by Kenneth Ross, the script merely acts as a smart guideline for the action. Fred Zinnemann, directing his first film in several years, observes the actions of The Jackal and the French Secret Service's attempts to capture the Jackal with a carefully detached eye. He pays close attention to detail, much like the Jackal, leaving little room for error. Several people complained that the direction was boring, but really, it's very smart in its simplicity. Zinnemann allows for his actors and action to play out in very realistic manner, giving the film an engaging sense of time, making its viewers engaged in what's happening. The straight, no nonsense photography and lack of music add to that feel, giving this film much more credibility. Oh, and the settings utilized incredibly well too. The only noticeable style in this film is the editing, in its creation of clever transitions, like cutting shots, while using the previous soundtrack. Michael Lonsdale plays the head detective for the French Secret Service with collected calm. Highly aware and patient, he creates a smart and understated hero for the film. Meanwhile, on the other side of the political scandal, we have Edward Fox's Jackal, a super cool, highly resourceful, and highly aware individual. He too, practices the art of patience, and at any set- back, he's able to resourcefully able to work his out of it. But, don't try to negotiate with Mr. Jackal, because if he must come to it, he has no qualms about hurting someone in order to protect himself. A very amoral, if not fascinating anti-hero for this film.The film was released in July of 1973, as an action thriller for Universal, labeled as dime a dozen action flick by publications such as the New York Times. Yet its gained longevity because of it's it tight plotting, nuanced performances, realistic action, and dark and unusual humor, this film will live far beyond its years. This film transcends the typical Hollywood action genre by being smarter than the average thriller, and by patiently waiting for the Jackal's next move, it's hard not to finish this movie. Some might speak of Michael Caton-Jones 1997 remake favorably, but the only reason people may think it's any good at all is because of impaired judgment from excessive repeat viewings on USA network... But seriously, while the remake is violent, stylized, and dull, the original is engaging, smart, and thoughtful. My only complaint is the ending's similarities to the original Manchurian Candidate's finale. But even so, this film has a satisfying conclusion.To those who think that is long and boring, try sitting through this with an open mind. Unfortunately, modern audiences have tricked into thinking that good film-making consists if gritty realistic violence like Gladiator, or irritatingly hyperactive style and pace like The Matrix. This is film of great substance and intrigue. I'm 18 and in high school, and even I was willing to give this a chance, and it's one of my favorite films because of that. It's movie making in the true sense of the word, because it shows you a story. So please, forget about your MTV or Jerry Bruckheimer produced material, and try something thoughtful and interesting. This may be long by today's standards, but it's well worth the wait in the end. -Blake Goble, film watcher, maker, and addict",

Also Fox is all too believable as a killer. The plot also takes place all over Europe jumping around from country to country. Despite the large cast and multiple story lines I was never confused and thoroughly engrossed. Expert direction by Zimmerman helps also. I have one small complaint--it goes on a bit too long.

            "content": "Frederick Forsyth was a popular journalist with a nose for murky stories of wars, coups, mercenaries, corruption and assassinations in murky countries. What makes this masterful and beautifully shot adaptation of Day of the Jackal so compelling is the almost fly on the wall view of a professional hit-man - the best money could buy - going about his business. A grey character who can pass unnoticed in almost any situation, unflustered and immensely resourceful, The Jackal (Edward Fox) - we never know his real identity - has only one focus. Human contact is solely to achieve that goal. Even his sexuality he casually uses to that end. There is no glamour just rational necessity - a human life only of value for what it can do for him. The only person he genuinely appears to relate to is his underworld gunsmith - each recognises the other as a craftsman at the top of his respective craft. The target is President Charles De Gaulle, at the time (1962) about to commit - in the eyes of the French settlers in Algeria - the ultimate act of betrayal and treachery: to give Algeria back to the Algerians. Not a remote colony but a Department of France, generations of French settlers had lived and died there. One million Algerians had died in the fight for independence. France is divided as is its army. A faction plots to kill De Gaulle but even this faction is riven with informers - hence the employment of the faceless nameless stranger. The two central characters are The Jackal and the policeman (Michel Lonsdale) - the family man who has placed on his shoulders the Herculean task and lone responsibility of protecting the living embodiment of France herself: Charles De Gaulle. The last 30 minutes especially is nail-biting stuff.",

It stars Edward Fox, Michael Lonsdale, Terence Alexander, Michel Auclair, Alan Badel, Tony Britton and Denis Carey. Music is by Georges Delerue and cinematography by Jean Tournier.As the French political climate reaches boiling point over the Algeria situation, underground organisation the OAS plot to have President Charles de Gaulle assassinated. When an attempt fails the OAS members not caught are exiled in Vienna and decide that bringing in an outsider to kill the President is now the best way forward. That outsider is an Englishman, code name The Jackal, a methodically cunning and deadly assassin.Wonderful, the kind of character driven thriller that has become in short supply over the last couple of decades. It's all so simple, even sedate, yet this calm approach serves the plotting perfectly. After the initial set ups we follow The Jackal (a super icy turn by Fox) on his mission to kill General de Gaul. His planning, the people he meets, and the people he has to kill to stay one step ahead of the authorities. From cons to weapon smuggling, to disguises and sexual encounters, it's thoroughly compelling from Jackal's story arc alone, but the frequent shifts to the hunt for him by a whole ream of suits and detectives is also gripping and suspenseful viewing.Backing Fox up is a raft quality performers, a cast very much in tune with the material to hand. Delure's musical composition is purposely of the minimalist breed, Tournier's photography is period compliant and smooth, while Ralph Kemplen's excellent editing was rightly nominated for an Academy Award. Zinnerman does sterling work from the director's chair, amazingly keeping a two and half hour movie free of extraneous scenes or pointless exposition. Everything is relative, it really is a film to stay focussed with, to give it respect by giving it your undivided attention. So go the bathroom before sitting down to view this truly great and smart thriller. 9/10",

It's a movie that I always enjoy watching and I find it to be a very entertaining one.The movie has a wonderful story. It's also an unique one, because it for once focuses more on the bad guy than on the good guys. The movie follows the assassin, nicknamed the jackal, on his mission to murder the French president De Gaulle. We see his preparations and how he slowly maneuvers himself into positions, and mingles with people and blend in with the crowd, all to achieve his goal. Of course not everything is going as planned and he has to improvise his way through situations, at times, while the police is getting closer and closer to finding out his true identity- and his track. The entire story is extremely well constructed and build up fantastic. The story takes it time to unfold things and everything eventually leads up to the fantastic end finale, that truly is unforgettable, as is the entire movie as a whole.The cast is also a reason why this movie works so very well and is an unforgettable one. The cast of the movie is not filled with some 'big' well known names but rather with some excellent, lesser known actors, that were cast because of their abilities to play the character and not because of their well known name. Edward Fox shines as the jackal and he perhaps plays his most memorable part out of his career. Michael Lonsdale, who plays the main 'good guy' of the movie but yet is only introduced half way through the movie, also plays one of his best and most memorable roles.It certainly is a good and at times tense thriller but it mostly also is a very entertaining one to watch. It's no heavy movie and despite its long running time, the movie never has a slow or lesser moment in it. It's a very consistent movie, due to it's well written script and most excellent directing, from multiple Oscar winning- and nominee, director Fred Zinnemann.For the people who can appreciate a movie with a well build up thriller-story, this is a most definite must-see! Truly one of the very best thrillers and also certainly one of the most enjoyable ones ever made. It's yet another essential '70's viewing.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

De Gaulle did pull out of Algeria in 1962, infuriating the far right wing in France. The steps taken by the French detective (played wonderfully by Michel Lonsdale) are as meticulous as you would expect from a detective attempting to save the life of the president of his country.

There is one exception to this peculiar (and admittedly shallow) personal rule, however, namely if I have the rare opportunity to watch such a film on a lazy and carefree Sunday afternoon. It only happens like once or twice per year that my wife doesn't plan an activity or my children don't claim the television, but last Sunday was such a heyday and, coincidentally, a local TV-channel programmed this absorbing and meticulously perfect 70s thriller about the (largely fictional) plot to assassinate the French President Charles De Gaulle in 1963. Fred Zinneman's \"Day of the Jackal\" shows just how stupid my personal rule is, as the two-and-a-half hour running time literally flies by, and in return you're treated to a nail-bitingly suspenseful thriller with a fantastic screenplay, stupendous acting performances and an astonishingly wide range of authentic Central European (mainly French, obviously) filming locations. \"Day of the Jackal\" is 45 years old now, but the subject matter is still as relevant now as it was in 1973, and I wouldn't be too surprised if there comes another remake within a few years in which the assassination target gets replaced by, say, President Donald Trump. The biggest strength, as always, is the meticulous and nearly flawless screenplay. Adapted from the novel by Frederic Forsyth, \"Day of the Jackal\" is steadily paced and patiently embraces all the tiniest details of a convoluted political assassination plot. Following a failed attempt, the French political underground movement OAS approaches a professional and reputedly high efficient hit man. This man, known only by his code name Jackal, seemingly doesn't have a real identity but immediately proves himself a master in preparing his assignment. Meanwhile, the French authorities found out about the new assassination plot via the arrest of an OAS member and put their most hardened Parisian police commissioner on the case. \"Day of the Jackal\" also owes a lot of its powerful impact to the downright staggering performance of Edward Fox as the Jackal. Perhaps the absence of a big name for the lead role was the main reason for the box office flop, but Fox definitely is the right choice for the role. He's inconspicuous but extremely menacing at the same time and it's genuinely unsettling to see how calm and nihilistic he remains under the most stressful conditions. Michael Lonsdale is also fantastic as the inexhaustible Commissioner Lebelle in hot pursuit of the Jackal, and there are some memorable supportive roles for Derek Jacobi, Jean Sorel and Olga Georges-Picot.",

            "content": "What we have here is a top quality thriller from Fred Zinnemann! The film is based on the book by Frederick Forsyth and follows a story surrounding the assassination of French president, Charles de Gaulle. The film is, apparently, historically accurate - personally, I can't say whether it is or not, since I don't know much about the situation it follows; but I do know that the film continually achieves it's aim of thrilling the audience, and that's what is most important from my point of view. The film apparently bombed at the box office; and that's hardly surprising, as French history isn't a big point of interest for many other countries - and the fact that it stars an unknown actor in the lead role ensures that the film was on the back foot from the beginning. However, audiences back in 1973 don't know what they were missing - as thrillers don't come much more assured and classy than this one! The film follows the French Foreign Legion as they hire a professional assassin to dispose of the president. We then follow said professional, as well as a French detective as it counts down to the supposed day of the president's death.This is something of an odd thriller, as director Fred Zinnemann continually keeps the action relaxed and there is no music score; or obvious attempts to build tension. All the suspense flows from the central plot, and by keeping everything relaxed - the film has a 'calm before the storm' atmosphere throughout, which serves both in being foreboding and ensuring that the audience always wants to know what's going to happen next. Zinnemann hardly shows the target upon which the whole movie revolves around - namely, President de Gaulle, and this is of benefit to the film as it means that the action can focus on the more important plot threads of the assassin and the detective. The acting is good throughout, with unknown actor Edward Fox doing well in providing a frighteningly incognito performance as the Jackal. The plotting is good also, and Kenneth Ross' screenplay is perfectly pitched in providing thrills, as well as focusing on the implication of the plot itself. Overall, this is a finely tuned and classy little thriller and one that should not be missed by anyone that calls themselves a film fan!",

            "content": "Director Zinnemann succeeded in striking exactly the right note : his movie contains enough documentary (or pseudo-documentary) aspects to make a realistic impression, while telling a suspenseful and exciting story about the progress of an unusually competent, unusually deliberate criminal.Edward Fox gives a fine and well-measured lead performance. Every now and then he lets his character's bland and inoffensive mask slip, deliberately, so that one gets a tiny glimpse of the moral abyss inside, but he is wise enough to let his character's actions speak for themselves. This is a good decision, since any attempt at a psychologically profound and searching portrayal would throw the rest of the movie out of kilter. (Both movie and source novel focus on the mechanics of an international man hunt, rather than on individuals and their psyches.)The movie's budget was used wisely and well, and the location scouts knew their stuff. As a result the viewer is swept along in a varied and colourful tour of Europe, ranging from top secret briefings in London and emergency staff meetings in Paris to amorous escapades in countryside ch\u00e2teaux. So this is a pretty good movie. About the only aspect that annoyed me was the profusion of languages and (pseudo-)accents : English, French, Frenglish, Angelench, and so on. It was as confusing as the Tower of Babel disaster, especially since the use of these various tongues did not seem to be ruled by narrative logic. (If my memory serves me well it's a phenomenon similar to that seen and heard in \"Where eagles dare\", where everybody speaks everything and anything, all the time.)Fun note : watch out for the scene where the Jackal gets his just rewards. His body is thrown against an unfortunate piece of architecture. The said piece of architecture moves and shakes, visibly. Aaah, the tender walls of France, they're so sensitive !",

            "content": "You gotta hand it to the Brits. They truly know how to make a captivating thriller.After seeing 1971's \"Get Carter\" I enjoyed another great ride with this story of a British assassin, known only as Jackal, hired by Organisation Arm\u00e9e Secr\u00e8te (OAS) to kill French president Charles De Gaulle. Consisting of disgruntled former French army officers and foreign legionnaires, the OAS felt De Gaulle betrayed France's interests by granting independence to Algeria so they decided to take him out. After several failed assassination attempts they turn to Jackal (Edward Fox), an outsider with a proved track record, who agrees to do it for $1,000,000.His planning is so meticulous and thorough that at certain times it's easy to forget what he's about and start pulling for him. Movie is not shy about showing us the gritty details of an assassination plan, either. In fact, I have serious doubts if many of the 'do it yourself' scenes would make it past the censors in today's era of global terrorist threat. As he does his legwork jumping from Vienna to London to Paris to Genova against a colourful sexy European scenery we get a romanticized portrait of an ascot-wearin', Alfa Romeo-drivin' assassin who leaves nothing to chance (thankfully this never approaches the cheese level of your average James Bond flick).My minor complaints about \"The Day of the Jackal\" are more logistical in nature and have to do with how quickly the French police and Scotland Yard get on Jackal's trail when they have pretty much nothing but his possible codename to start with. Also, entire first act is spent portraying him as a cunning, calculated professional with a nose for sticky situations, yet in the latter scenes he makes many reckless choices when laying low would clearly be a more sensible option. Even if you buy his decision to proceed to Paris instead of returning to the safety of Italy when he knew police were hot on his trail after figuring out his first assumed identity, what exactly was the thinking behind the decision to go on with the plan even after police had his second false identity and ran hourly bulletins on TV. Even if he somehow managed to kill De Gaulle that day, did he really think he could successfully leave Paris afterwards? Why such a revolutionary resolve? After all, unlike OAS, he's in this only for the money. But, anyway....And yes, I full well realize that this is not a biopic and that without the preceeding there probably wouldn't be a movie - so everything is forgiven.The undeniable facts remain - \"The Day of the Jackal\" is a thoroughly fun, charming and stylish thriller and that's an even greater feat considering its serious historical and political backdrop.",

            "content": "From BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Fred Zinnemann (From Here to Eternity, A Man for All Seasons), I knew I had to see the five star rated original before the Bruce Willis remake. Basicaly, set in 1960's France, many surviving members of the aborted French Foreign Legion have attempted to assassinate President General Charles De Gaulle (Adrien Cayla-Legrand), and he is now one of the most protected men in the world. Desperate to get the job done, an assassin known only as The Jackal (Edward Fox) is hired to kill the leader in return for half a million dollars. Throughout we see his preparations for the assassination, including his weapon choice and places to hide for the shot. The French police meanwhile, led by detective Claude Lebel (BAFTA nominated Michael Lonsdale), are on his trail and trying to catch him, with only some misleading and fake passport identifications to help them. The day of the big parade the President will be attending approaches, and The Jackal and the police are both set to make their moves, it is just a question of whether the villain we have grown to admire will succeed and get the long awaited shot. Also starring Alan Badel as The Minister, Tony Britton as Inspector Thomas, Cyril Cusack as The Gunsmith, Donald Sinden as Mallinson, Derek Jacobi as Caron, Eric Porter as Colonel Rodin, BAFTA nominated Delphine Seyrig as Colette, Olga Georges-Picot as Denise and Timothy West as Berthier. Fox is masterful in the leading performance giving the role a good depth and intrigue, you could almost say your on his side, but Lonsdale does well as the good guy too, it is a magnificent thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTA for Best Film Editing, and it was nominated for Best Film, Best Screenplay and Best Sound Track, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay.

So, I guess it would be better for me to say that I appreciated the non-digitalness of it. Everything done was done without the aid of a digital device. There were no computers used, or cameras with facial recognition software, or smart phones, just a lot of manual labor done by astute and attentive people. The movies today of this nature are so tech heavy it's refreshing to see a good ingenious film that was tech-less.\"The Day of the Jackal\" was an elaborate game of cat and mouse. The French authorities (the cats) were aware that there was a planned assassination attempt on their general by someone called the Jackal (the mouse).But what makes a cat and mouse movie good? There are so many out there and they're not all good as you well know. It has to be the moves and counter moves that make it so compelling. When two chess masters play it is a great game. When a chess master plays a novice then it is a bore. \"The Day of the Jackal\" had two chess masters going at it. On the one hand was Inspector Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) and on the other hand was the Jackal (Edward Fox). If the Jackal was to complete his mission, he would have to stay two to three steps ahead of the authorities. If Lebel was to stop the Jackal, he would have to predict the Jackal's next move.The moves and counter moves were brilliant and anything short of brilliance would've been a failure for the characters and hence for the movie itself.",

            "content": "Avoid the awful 1997 remake. Neither Bruce Willis and Richard Gere can hold a candle to Edward Fox and Michael Lonsdale. This older movie is the real deal and an espionage classic in it's own right.The Day of the Jackal (1973) was directed by Fred Zinnemann. His previous film, A Man For All Seasons, won him two Oscars (best director, best picture) and four other Oscars including best screenplay. Zinnemann was at the top of his game when he made this movie.It is France in the 1960s. Algeria is still in French hands, but the local population clamours for independence. Opposing this is ultra right wing French nationalist terrorist cell, the OAS.In the movie one of its military leaders makes the ludicrous claim that the French have always lived there, revealing how pathologically disturbed right wing politics can be. The OAS has so far failed to stop the Algerian independence effort, both facts proving that while the OAS might be a formidable force, its leadership is totally xenophobic and somewhat eccentric; angry men out of touch.Their group however is made up of current and former French officers, so they are not without resources and manpower, some of whom are willing to die for their violent cause. After French President Charles de Gaulle moves to quite rightly hand back Algeria to the Algerians, the OAS of course see this as an outrageous betrayal and immediately set about hiring an assassin to murder him. Enter Edward Fox as wily hit-man \"The Jackal\". He cares naught for politics. He does however care about this one last retirement score, evading authorities and staying alive long enough to enjoy it. This is Edward Fox's best ever performance. The decision to cast him as the sharp eyed determined yet unassuming assassin is one of the great casting decisions in cinematic history. His every movement, expression, however subtle, tells you at a molecular level what this character was born to do - hide in the general population patiently and strike fast when the opportunity presents itself and then escape quietly before anyone is aware he was ever there. Fox has a small unassuming frame so as not to obviously intimidate anyone, where a larger man is more likely to be remembered. He looks like a Hitchcockian \"every man\"; he blends in smoother than coffee in milk, entering and leaving unnoticed everywhere he goes. He doesn't have Jimmy Stewart's height to stand out in a crowd, or Cary Grant's memorable dashing good looks. He is however nondescript and lethal.No one is ever able to give a description or remember his several fake names. Even the police overlook him. Fox's performance is just sublime. His calm demeanor and well groomed appearance belies his lethality and puts everyone quickly at ease; Always the consummate professional.The man assigned to hunt him down is the best detective France can muster, Commissioner Label played by bilingual French born Michael Lonsdale. This is one of the best mirror image portrayals of villain and hero in movie history; They are both as cunningly efficient and determined as each other. Based on Frederick Forsyth's novel of the same name, both he and director Zinnemann left no stone unturned in revealing how The Jackal prepares for the hit. It's the hit-man version An Actor Prepares. This is a brilliantly written, directed and acted film. If you like espionage films about assassins, this is the best movie around bar none. The Day of the Jackal (1973) deserves a criterion bluray edition. Please help that effort by emailing distributors if you can. Thank you.",

The rest of the film is a rollercoaster ride that documents the uncovering and pursuit of a would-be assassin that you could call Crime and Punishment.  Together, you'll see one of the most tense thrillers ever made. The Jackal is a man like any other.  Or so it seems. He works hard for his money.  He studies.  He observes. He prepares.  He also kills, at will, anyone who will get in the way of his objective:  the real-life assassination attempt of France Prime Minister Charles de Gaulle.I'm not sure how accurate the story is in regards to history, but history tells us de Gaulle was not shot in 1963.  He sure as hell was shot at, though.  Fox's performance is so convincing and suave, we start to cringe when he gets cornered.  The life of a professional assassin is a lonely one, but he'll use some women and others along the way.  Nothing fazes him.The film is extremely smart.  The French security for de Gaulle, led by an independent commissioner, are right on the Jackal's trail, but always one step behind.  Just when they seem to catch up, he rubs one in their face by disappearing like Houdini.  As for the Hollywood remake, starring Willis and Gere:  not even close.  Not even worthy of mentioning in the same breath. With the original, we have a true attempt during tumultuous political times on the life of a French General.  The remake has the killer after a Hillary Rodham Clinton look-alike, pure fiction.  I sense a pattern here...Just watch the true one.",

My primary memories of it are long, slow, wordless shots of the Jackal adjusting the sights on his rifle, assessing the ever-changing situation, or coldly observing, with reptilian eyes, the human beings he plans to use next.It's a loose contemporary of both The French Connection and The Ipcress File, as well as the films of Jean-Pierre Melville, all of which feel cut from a similar cloth and are very much worth checking out if in the mood for something in the same vein.",

            "content": "Based on the 1971 novel of the same name DAY OF THE JACKAL was a movie that took suspense on a different route than most movies. Rather than having a top notch secret agent using suave moves and terrific gadgets to find a hidden assassin it played it straight instead opting for a more realistic approach. Our hero looks more like an honest to goodness government investigator instead and employs the methods one would really use rather than flying cars. The end result is a magnificent movie from director Fred Zinnemann.The story takes place in 1962 after an attempt has been made on the life of President Charles De Gaulle in France. The attempt was made by the OAS or Organisation arm\u00e9e secrete, a paramilitary group that formed shortly after the Algerian War that considered De Gaulle a traitor after granting independence to Algeria. When the attack fails they realize they need to bring in a specialists from outside of their organization.The professional assassin (Edward Fox) agrees to take on the job at a cost of $500,000 US dollars. He takes on the code name \"The Jackal\" and things move forward. To pay for the assassination the OAS members stage a series of robberies. In the meantime the Jackal sets about trying to find the proper tools he will need to carry out his mission.While this is taking place the French security forces are doing their best to find out what the OAS has planned next and to take down the organization. Kidnapping the OAS' chief clerk he dies under interrogation but not before providing them the smallest of information including the word \"jackal\". The Interior Minister pulls together a secret cabinet meeting and at the advice of his police chief assigns Deputy Commissioner Claude Lebel (Michel Lonsdale) to head up the investigation.The film then moves back and forth between the two men as one plots to kill the President of France and the other does what he can to prevent it. The Jackal gets fake documents to get him past security and helps with the design of a special gun to use to pull off the job. It's lightweight and fits inside a series of tubes that can be changed to look like a pair of crutches.Lebel follows up all leads at his disposal and eventually comes up with the real name and identity of the Jackal. Contacting his counterparts in England. It's in their best interests as well to find the man as the death of a foreign dignitary at the hands of one of their own would reflect poorly on the country.As the Jackal moves forward with his plans he takes shelter in the most unlikely of places, avoiding hotels and residing in the homes of those he meets on his journey. He leaves behind him a trail of bodies but no way to connect each of them.As the clues connect Lebel becomes certain of the day that the Jackal will make his attempt on De Gaulle. Refusing to change his schedule to accommodate the attempt on his life security forces work around the clock to finally find the killer and take him out before he can follow through with his plan. Only time will tell if he succeeds or fails.The movie works on so many levels and shows why author Frederick Forsyth has always been able to spin a solid yarn. While so many thrillers have chosen to follow the path of James Bond his books and the films based on them have been more inclined to be set in realistic situations with real people instead. It makes them just as entertaining and in the long run more frightening as they seem more credible. The methods used by the Jackal here seem as if they could actually take place.There isn't a bad performance here and the choice to use lesser known actors in the lead roles works well for the film. Rather than seeing an all too familiar face the movie uses that to its advantage so that not only is the situation more believable but so are the characters. Remade years later as THE JACKAL that film starred Richard Gere and Bruce Willis and the name value diminished the story aspect of the film. At the time Fox had not really had a solid lead role in his resume and Lonsdale was more known in France than in worldwide films.Arrow Films is releasing this in a wonderful package with the film being presented in hi def blu-ray. In addition to that they've packed the film with several extras that are sure to please fans of the film and those who've yet to view it for the first time. The extras here include a new interview with Neil Sinyard, the author of FRED ZINNEMAN: FILMS OF CHARACTER AND CONSCIENCE, two rare archival clips from the film set including an interview with Zinnemann, the theatrical trailer, the original screenplay (BD-ROM content), a reversible sleeve with original and newly commissioned artwork by Peter Strain and for the first pressing only an illustrated collector's booklet featuring new writing on the film by Mark Cunliffe and Sheldon Hall. Do I need to say it again? Arrow is doing an amazing job with every single offering they have.If you've never seen the film I can't recommend it highly enough. It is methodical in its approach and in the way it shows the plan that the Jackal has in store for this assassination. It entertains and at the same time inspires a slight amount of fear when you consider the possibilities of how an assassin might approach his target. This is a movie that can be enjoyed not just once but with repeated viewings. If nothing else make sure you do so at least once.",

            "content": "STORY: The Day of The Jackal is set against the struggles of the paramilitary organisation the OAS in France and their attempts to kill President Charles De Gaulle. With the exact same story as the book, it focuses around one fictional attempt in 1963 when the leaders hire a mysterious foreign professional assassin. It follows this man (The Jackal) as he plans and prepares the assassination whilst the secret service and police detectives launch a secret manhunt for this unknown killer. The film is all about suspense so very little action actually occurs in this film. It may be a little slow for some tastes but I honestly think that's what makes the film so unique. It had me on the edge of my seat almost throughout, and there was no need for recent Hollywood style guns blazing action. It's a film for the intellectual. Also as one reviewer mentioned, it is completely free from clich\u00e9s. Our killer is never made out to be inherently evil, just a professional doing a job. Similarly, the leading detective on this case is as far from the 'maverick who never plays by the rules but always gets his man' clich\u00e9 as he could possibly be. This is a definite plus in my books and is what really let the re-make down (the one with Bruce Willis), it was just too American with too much action and too many character clich\u00e9s. DOTJ has a flawless plot for those with the patience and attention span to go last more than five minutes without a fight or chase scene. The fact that it is based around factual history allowed me to become fully immersed in the film 5/5EXECUTION: Aside from having a brilliant story, the film is also executed remarkably. I'm told Edward Fox (The Jackal) made his name off of this film and that does not surprise me at all, he plays the part exactly as I would have imagined having read the book. He definitely steals the whole show. The other acting is great for the time it was made but is not in the same league as Fox. The film is directed almost as if it were a documentary which suits the style. Again action fans will be disappointed and probably bored by this but I felt it added to the realism. Similarly the fact that there is no soundtrack caused me to become more involved with the characters. I should point out that the film does sometimes show its age especially with the use of the infamous 1960s 'judo chop of death' but I can honestly say it didn't bother me or effect my immersion at all possibly because it's not an action film and the small number of deaths throughout were not a major part of it. The directing style topped with some near perfect acting mean DOTJ is almost perfectly executed, any minor nitpicks can be attributed to its age. 5/5VERDICT: In this day of films basically being poorly done remakes of the Bourne films with ridiculous stunts and strong character clich\u00e9s, an intellectual film is greatly appreciated. I can see why this film became a classic in the 1970s and I believe it is a timeless masterpiece and a fine example of how films don't need action, swearing or unrealistic characters who 'let their gun do the talking'. Clever dialogue and a very suspenseful story at the expense of fast paced action mean this film won't be for everybody. But those who appreciate a more realistic film which makes them think cannot go wrong with the Day of the Jackal. 5/5 + 5/5 = 10/10",

            "content": "On the opposite end of an assassination scale from, say, The Interpreter, there's Fred Zinnemann's The Day of the Jackal, maybe a quiet second to the original The Manchurian Candidate for sheer, unnerving suspenseful pressure.What Zinnemann has done is to create a terrifying political-assassination thriller that looks and feels like a cross between a home movie and a documentary. It works on two diametrically opposed levels. It's clinical and cold, a dark tale of the plot to kill President Charles DeGaulle in the early 1960s, that is both elegant and sun-washed in its European locales. At the same time, TDOTJ is a personal look at two characters, the assassin and the policeman, both of whom are sympathetic. You admire the humanity of Michael Lonsdale's investigator, but you also feel a kinship with Edward Fox's Jackal, mannequin-like in his cold efficiency, but admirable in his intellect and chameleon-like adaptability.No matter how much you don't want to do it, you find yourself rooting for the bad guy, mainly because he's so good when he's one-half step in front of the law.That's why The Day of the Jackal works so well. It's more than an advertisement for visiting Europe (although Italy and France look very, very inviting). As an American, you may find yourself somewhat ambivalent toward DeGaulle getting whacked. It's the fact that The Day of the Jackal is a suspenseful, clinical, and human story that makes it so very good.Much like The Manchurian Candidate's Raymond Shaw, who is such a psychological basket case, but you forgive anyway, \"Charles Calthrop\" is a killing machine you know you must not cheer for, but you do anyway.Fred Zinnemann's been messin' with your head, a bit like the Jackal messed with that watermelon in the forest.",

The chilling thing is that they are discussing making a special gun, and those questions are not \"Single or double breasted?\", but \"Will it be a head or body shot?\" He doesn't care who this stranger is going to shoot.

High Noon can be given as an example. In this case, it is a British Contract Killer code-named \"The Jackal\" Vs The French Government Officials who want to stop him from killing the French President. The Jackal is hired by a group of rebels who call themselves the OAS to kill the French President. The movie can be broadly divided into two sections - The Jackal's planning and plotting to kill The President which includes forging documents, stealing passports, flirting with women, getting a custom-made weird gun created etc. And on the other hand, the efforts of French officials under the leadership of Police Commissioner Lebel to stop the Jackal from inducing this 'National Emergency'. The Jackal is always one step ahead of the French Officials throughout the movie except the thrilling climax. Zinnemann has taken great care of the minute details due to which Critics can point out very little or no loop-holes in the plot. This movie which has a very complex plot could have gone completely wrong in case of bad direction. But Zinnemann has made sure that it does not happen. Acting wise, Edward Fox who plays The Jackal has done an average job. The person who impressed me was Alan Badel who played Commissioner Lebel. A great thriller not to be missed.Rating : 8/10",

            "content": "In thrillers' orthodoxy, the effectiveness of suspense relies on the outcome's unpredictability. If the main character is a killer, there has to be chances for his success, and any slight intuition that he might not accomplish his mission would severely undermine the film's value as a thriller.However, there is no rule without exceptions, and on that level, \"The Day of the Jackal\", released by Fred Zimmerman in 1973, is a fantastic school-case proving that thrills can be efficiently driven regardless of what they're leading up to. The film, adapted from Frederick Forsyth's best-seller, centers on a professional killer, Edward Fox as 'the Jackal' assigned by the underground army group OAS to assassinate General De Gaulle, on anger for his granting the independence to Algeria, thus betraying his vows to the French Army.And there are reasons why the 'Jackal' demands half-a million dollars for his services besides danger and De Gaulle's difficulty to be 'approached': he's giving them France on a silver plate, he'll never be able to work again and they can use their networks to rob banks and jewelries \u0085 not to mention he has to make sure he can escape after the killing. Naturally, all these precautions hardly matter on the long term, we know De Gaulle will live, but it's less in the killing than the way its planning is masterfully and meticulously constructed, Zimmerman displays indeed a level of craftsmanship matching the Jackal's professionalism.'Professionalism\" is a key word enhancing \"The Day of the Jackal\"'s cinematic greatness. The film chronicles with a documentary-like realism all the steps, every single move anticipating the assassination. To obtain a passport, he uses the birth certificate of an Englishman who'd be his age if he didn't die at 2, he then moves to Genoa to order false passports from a forger and a lightweight rifle with telescopic sight and a silencer from a gunsmith. Meanwhile, he spots the apartment in Paris with the best view on Place du 18 Juin 1940, duplicates the key to the upper flat, and steals a passport in London's airport from a Danish tourist.To spice up the plot, the French Secret Services spot the location where the OAS members exiled and their investigation concludes on another plot against the President. They have clues that a fair-haired Englishman visited the place but nothing else. The way their services collaborate with other foreign agencies, mainly Scotland Yard, use registration cards from hotels prove the Jackals's precautions right, he rightfully expected that the cover to be blown (not without the use of torture) \u0085 but the thrills come from the whole cat-and-mouse game between European police bureaucracies and one man who single-handedly challenges them all.That's one of the greatest delights provided by \"The Day of the Jackal\", and Fox' performance is crucial here. He appears like a highly-educated upper-class Englishman who can easily go unnoticed in a summertime France full of tourists, we eagerly follow him in his tour all over Europe (the escapism of \"The Day of the Jackal\" is another strength worth mentioning) and even when he's told about the French police's progresses (a spy was hired to become the mistress of a French minister), he manages to slip through the net, using his boyish charm to seduce a bourgeois woman or a Danish disguise to seduce a Parisian in a Turkish bathhouse.On the other side, professionalism is also working, and Inspector Raymond Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) is given full power to track and find the 'Jackal' In total secrecy according to De Gaulle's orders, De Gaulle wouldn't change his schedule, let alone the August 25 celebration of the Resistance Day, coincidentally the likeliest time for the assassination. Zimmerman swings back and forth from the Jackal to the Police, from the borders to the hotels, with an advantage in time, the Jackal intelligently exploits. Luck or hazard are never parameters, it's essentially the courage and the nerve of a no-nonsense man who trusts his professionalism.Back to that professionalism thing, there is an interesting sequence in Genoa, where the Jackal takes the rifle from the gunsmith (Cyril Cusack) : the man proves his reliability by not asking questions and remaining all matter-of-factly over the killing-marvel he created. On the other hand, the forger tries to blackmail the Jackal and gets exactly what was coming to him. The parallel between the two attitudes highlights that no matter how 'malevolent' he is, the Jackal has 'ethics' , there is a way you should deal with him and a way not to. Still, he can kill any by-passer on his deadly path, women and even older ones won't be spared.Indeed, no matter who die, De Gaulle remains the man-not-to-be-killed. \"The Jackal\" still has an interesting body count. Some murders are cold-blooded and particularly brutal but they provide the required two-dimensionality for leading villain. And by that, I don't mean the man lacks depth, but what to expect from a professional killer who's only dedicated to his last mission? He can't show anything but what is shown is enough, and the contrast between his elegance and ruthlessness, as for the Inspector's average appearance but undeniable competence, two opposite at the top of their game, is enough to thrill us.And as a thriller, \"The Day of the Jackal\" is a heart-pounding combination of suspense, realism with regular outbursts of violence, it's a two-hour and 15 minutes race against the clock that never seems to long. Granted the outcome predictable, it's not in the 'what will happen' but 'how it will'. The editing answers to the 'how' and is curiously the only Oscar-nominated aspect of the film; frankly I would have nominated it for Best Directing and Best Writing as well, one of the greatest thrillers of the 70's",

Even something as mundane as the Jackal buying a melon in an Italian market is for him to go off and do target practise to calibrate his rifle.The Jackal's preparations are meticulous, ingenious. Inspector Thomas's efforts to track down the Jackal's various identities are laborious. But with Lebel leading the police work, they are never too far behind the Jackal.Zinnemann's directing is perfect too. There are wonderful shots, camera angles. The plot development in the first 2 hours is relentless up until the Jackal getting into position. Then there is a sudden change of pace.

The movie is shot with detailing exterior of 70's France & not in Studio.

This is a great film, correctly adapted and realized by the screenplay writer and the director. The only not quite right thing about this film that I have to point out is: It looks too British, almost all of the actors were British, only Superintendent Lebel was a true French. That's why this film didn't feel a bit like what it should be. If the French characters in this film was like what as we read in the novel, they should be played 100% by the French actors. It's an international co-operated operation, the producers and the director should have no problem to use the French to play French, I don't know why he couldn't have done that. The settings in this film were all French, but the cabinet meeting were all British, it just looked unrealistic and funny. \nThe background and the time are when there were no central air-conditioning or window air-condition units, no fax, no cell phone, no internet, no wi-fi hotspots, people were still chain-smoking in windowless offices, no Chinese take-out boxes on the office desk, even no pizza at all. What we got and saw in this film were lot of Citron sedans, Alfa-Romeo 2-seater, phone with rotary dial, or public phone service stations, telephone booth was not available yet. These 70s' scenes are very nostalgic and should be preciously appreciated. The tempo of this film was exactly it should be, and you should not consider it dated.

Can he pull off this remarkable crime, or will Police Inspector Claude Lebel find him first ?Based on the bestselling 1971 novel by Frederic Forsyth, this is an exciting European thriller with great locations (Bloomsbury in London, Genoa, Montparnasse in Paris), a gripping storyline throughout and an unusual premise; we know DeGaulle wasn't killed, so we know the ending to the picture. How then does it hold our interest - it becomes the story of how close The Jackal comes to succeeding, and, much more significantly, the story of his methodology. We see him meeting his contacts, preparing his fake identities, smuggling his weapon across the border, constructing disguises, avoiding detection. He plans everything carefully, but also improvises and adjusts his schemes as and when required. He is truly a phantom, and as such this film is the blueprint for many good hit-man thrillers which came later (In The Line of Fire, L\u00e9on, Grosse Pointe Blanke). I must confess I don't usually like Fox, but here he is pretty good, mostly because he has very little to say and the movie is so matter-of-fact. He is well matched by Lonsdale as Lebel, the steady, commensurate professional detective, and the cast has some interesting supporting players like Cusack (the genteel gunsmith) and Pickup (the ill-fated forger). With good photography by Jean Tournier and first-rate editing by Ralph Kemplen (who won an Academy Award), this is a well put-together thriller by old pro Zinnemann, and the touchstone assassin character study movie. Followed by a sort of sequel, The Jackal in 1997. Trivia - if you like Citroen DS cars there are a lot of them in this movie.",

            "content": "A wonderful, stylish, unrelentingly tense thriller. Despite its storyline about the chase to catch an unknown assassin hired to kill de Gaulle, the movie is surprisingly free of gore and graphic violence.  In fact, the only uncomfortable depiction of violence comes, ironically enough, while the police are torturing a terrorist for information.  Edward Fox's Jackal is an efficient, surgical killer, who dispatches those in his way without superfluous brutality.  This almost mechanical, impersonal sort of killing is one of the most frightening aspects of his character; through it we catch glimpses of a completely dead soul under the charming, attractive surface the Jackal presents to the world.This movie relies on the viewer's intelligence to pick up on the subtle hints and nuances scattered throughout; as the Jackal crosses the border, we see his silent glance at the other travellers being stopped: tall and blonde, like himself, and we are immediately inside the mind of the killer, recognizing that the police are already on his trail.  Michael Lonsdale is great as the deceptively slow-moving, soft-spoken Inspector Lebel.  It is agonizing to see him being patronizingly thanked and dismissed by the Cabinet when he has almost captured the Jackal, only to be frantically summoned back after the confident officials have wasted precious time trying and failing to close in on the assassin themselves. We can feel Lebel's frustration as all his hard work is wasted, and in the end it all comes down to trying to spot the killer in the massive Liberation Day crowds.  Although the outcome is a matter of history, this film still keeps the viewer tense and wondering how it will all end right up to the last moment.",

            "content": "These days, it's fascinating to see Edward Fox playing crusty old gents in episodes of \"Midsummer Murders\" or \"Agatha Christie's Miss Marple\" when you know that back in the day, he was a super-fit assassin who could kill with one blow from the back of his hand.In fact he was just about the best hit man ever in just about the best thriller ever. Although \"The Day of the Jackal\" was made in 1973, with not one smartphone or desktop computer in sight, it is still the police procedural par excellence.I love all the detail as Edward Fox's methodical Jackal plans to assassinate Charles De Gaulle, and how Michael Londsdale's equally methodical French policeman, Claude Label, plans to stop him.When I first saw the movie in 1973, many of the British actors such as Maurice Denham, Derek Jacobi and Cyril Cusack etc., were familiar, but over the intervening years, they became almost like old friends, turning up in countless movies and television shows.The French actors and extras were perfectly cast, from the tough-looking characters playing OAS and Action Service men to the Citro\u00ebn chauffeured members of parliament, and the beautiful widow who uses her charms to get information about the government's plans.A few years ago, I lent the DVD to a friend who watched it with his teenage son. When I asked what they thought of it, he told me his son thought it lacked action - I think he felt the same. That attitude goes some way to explaining why over the decades; the ratio of action-heavy movies to films of depth has risen exponentially.The more you see of Fred Zinneman's movies the more you appreciate how good he was; a perfectionist. Where it could be argued that the movies of many of his famous contemporaries went off as they aged - Ford, Huston, Preminger - his movies never did. Even his last one \"Five Days One Summer\" is a beautifully understated and underrated cult classic.However there is little doubt about \"The Day of the Jackal\" - it's a lesson in how to put a film together.",

If you compare to \"The Jackal\" with Bruce Willis, where he made a huge weapon that fires projectiles as big as a pen, and it's fired by remote control, you'll see that simplistic and effective plans can be way better than the sophisticated ones.While watching The Jackal's preparation to the attack, I couldn't take my eyes of the screen, it's interesting and entertaining to watch, everything is very well explained, for example, throughout the movie The Jackal uses four different passports, and you know exactly when and where he's changing his identity.Verdict: With simple, but brilliant plot and direction, this movie is has something different than the others cat and mouse movies.",

            "content": "The Day of the Jackal captures to true spirit of Frederick Forsyth's exceptional first novel.  Kenneth Ross' script deserves praise in its ability to preserve more than just the essence of the book, an attribute often absent from many recent book-to-film adaptations. \nDuring the early 1960's, the OAS (Organisation Armee Secret) waged a terrorist campaign against French President Charles De Gaulle's administration. Angered by the loss of French lives after De Gaulle abandoned the French colonial war in Algeria, and hoped eventually to remove him through a coup d'\u00e9tat.With an incredible attention to detail, Fred Zinneman's masterful direction is superb, and his typically deliberate pace builds to a tensely anticipated and remarkably satisfying finale. Edward Fox gives his finest performance as The Jackal, a free lance assassin hired by the disillusioned OAS. Likewise, Michel Lonsdale's performance as the chief inspector who is overwhelmingly burdened with the French Government's pressure to save the life of the President from the unknown assassin is especially noteworthy. Cyril Cusack as the gunsmith also deserves special mention. The locations are truly authentic, taking us through some beautiful European settings and cities during a particularly unspoiled period, before the age of fast food and urban and suburban blight. Footnote:While one may shudder to imagine comparisons with Bruce Willis' so-called remake, The Jackal, it had nothing to do with the Forsyth book. Furthermore, it brought angry protests from the creators of the original film because it had retained the original title, The Day of the Jackal. Zinneman, along with Forsyth and Ross, forced the producers to change the title to The Jackal. The producers claimed they were adapting Ross' screenplay and not Forsyth's book, a dubious assertion, to be sure.",

            "content": "This film, set primarily in early 1960s Paris, offers a close look at a person who spends his life accepting contracts to kill other people in exchange for large wads of cash. The Jackal is a cold, calculating and very intelligent killer determined to succeed in his mission to whack the president of France, Charles de Gaulle. It does not matter much why this supposedly needs to be done. He agrees to kill on behalf of a fringe group of self-styled patriots who are incensed that Algeria has been granted its independence by the president. (As though it were his to confer!) The question how assassinating the president might alter the French renunciation of Algeria as a territory is not really treated in the film, but one surmises from their quasi-religious fervor that the members of the group somehow think that they can spark some sort of political revolution.The gist of this film is a close-up view of the contract killer in action\u2014including the intricacies of his plan and his amoral (or is that immoral?) modus operandi\u2014and the French police and security forces as they attempt to stop him. It's quite a story, with plenty of suspense and twists and turns, but the best part is the realistic and convincing portrayal of the sociopathic Jackal, who will stop at nothing to complete his contract and receive the second half of the huge amount of cash which awaits him. I regard The Day of the Jackal as one the best films on hit men ever made, right up there with Le Samoura\u00ef. Highly recommended!",

Unfortunately, the pacing and editing are a notch down on modern standards, ensuring that for the film to work, we really have to believe every detail.  Probably the greatest obstacle to this is the fact that all the dialogue occurs in English, with English actors in all the roles - in a story that passes from London to Vienna to Genova to Paris, this represents a wasted opportunity and the chameleon-like qualities of the Jackal are thus lost.

Zinnemann's low-key approach is a textbook example of how to make an exciting and sophisticated suspense film without relying on overblown action sequences or flashy visual effects. Zinnemann establishes a pace that is deliberate, but never boring.An underground terrorist group in France, the OAS, decide to hire a professional killer to assassinate French President Charles De Gaulle (Adrien Cayla-Legrand) after their previous attempts have failed. Their next move is to hire a professional assassin, an English hit man responsible for several high-profile assassinations. Charles Calthrop (Edward Fox) accepts the contract to assassinate the President, and takes on the alias of 'Jackal'. The Jackal methodically prepares to put his plan into action: gathering a new identity, collecting forged documents and a French passport, and finally a custom-built rifle. Top French police investigator Lebel (Michel Lonsdale) learns the name 'Jackal' from an informer in the plotter's ranks and cleverly pieces together the identity of the killer-for-hire.As with all good thrillers, it's the chase leading up to the climactic finale that is the best part of watching the plot unfold. In relating its tense tale of political wrangling, the intricate and meticulous story develops with a parallel structure that details the Jackal's preparations for the assassination, and Lebel's ongoing efforts to stop him. Fox is superb as the coldly impassioned assassin, and Lonsdale is magnificently analytical as the obsessive detective tracking him down. Despite its measured pace, the tension slowly mounts as the Jackal closes in on his high value target, and the authorities pull out all the stops to find him first.

The film appeals more to the intellect than the brute senses, as it traces the detection of an assassin hired to kill French President Charles de Gaulle.The story is set in Paris during a week in August of 1962. President De Gaulle (played by an uncanny look-alike), by granting Algeria their independence, upsets right-wing extremists and disgruntled war veterans, who form a secret terrorist organization known as OAS and vow to assassinate him. The film opens to a failed attempt on De Gaulle as he rides in a motorcade. After the OAS culprits are arrested and their leader executed six months later, their new leader and his three top aides secretly hire a mysterious Englishman- the eponymous Jackal (Fox) - to assassinate the President. Jackal accepts the offer and begins his methodical work to prepare the assassination. In the meantime, French security services receive some information about OAS plans and decide to hand over the case to Inspector Lebel (Lonsdale), the best investigator in France. But he doesn't even know who the jackal is. He learns the name \"Jackal\" from an informer in the plotter's ranks and cleverly pieces together the identity of the killer-for-hire.What follows is an intricate and meticulous story with a parallel structure that details the Jackal's preparations for the assassination and Lebel's efforts to stop him. The major asset of the film is that it succeeds in maintaining interest and suspense despite obvious viewer foreknowledge of the outcome. Director Zinnemann faithfully follows the source, presenting a precise, almost discomfiting reconstruction of the story. He directs it with the skill of a master craftsman, creating a riveting cat-and-mouse game between the mysterious lone-wolf hired assassin known only by his code name and the master policeman in charge of the investigation. He does a fine job of presenting the narrative in such a precise way despite offering no psychological analysis or humor, building in tension to the concluding assassination attempt. Playing the titular Jackal, Edward Fox is superb as the coldly impassionate killer. He's boyishly charming, impeccably groomed, possessed of an easy laugh, and casually ruthless. Michael Lonsdale is properly plodding, yet magnificently analytical as the detective tracking him down.The Day of the Jackal is a polished, electrifying thriller, mercifully unburdened with heavy political digressions. The screenplay meticulously assembles an incredible array of material, and then Fred Zinnemann choreographs it so that the story - complicated as it is - unfolds in almost documentary starkness. Telling the story very methodically, by exposing small details that would later be important pieces of great puzzle, he manages to achieve a dignified tone and compelling pace seldom seen in latter-day thrillers.",

            "content": "A brilliant film adaptation of a classic novel, Fred Zinnemann's \"The Day Of The Jackal\" uses every twist and turn of Frederic Forsyth's original story to produce a nail-biting feature of suspense and mystery. What it lacks in engagement, it makes up for in true professionalism.After yet another dispiriting failed attempt on the life of French President Charles de Gaulle, the commander of the right-wing terror group known as the OAS decides to bring in an outsider, to be known only as the Jackal and played brilliantly by Edward Fox as a perplexing amalgam of cold-blooded ruthlessness and charm.Because he's a killer who hasn't worked in France before, the Jackal \"won't have a police record,\" the OAS commander explains. \"He can come and go as he pleases. Officially he won't exist.\" That makes matters tougher for those French security officials who catch wind of the plot and focus on stopping the Jackal, most especially Inspector Lebel (Michael Lonsdale), a stooped and perpetually tired figure whose walrus mustache and caterpillar eyebrows contrast vividly with the smooth, perfectly fit Jackal.\"Day Of The Jackal\" works that way throughout, contrasting shots of the Jackal in his element (luxurious postcard vistas and beautiful women) with Lebel and his agents working in smoky, cramped offices or overbearingly ornate boardrooms where circumspection rules but leaks are a constant risk. Zinnemann deliberately downshifts from any signature shots or Hitchcockian setpiece sequences to offer a well-paced storyline that pauses on isolated moments of well-observed human behavior, like chauffeurs taking a cigarette break or priests at a ceremony being checked for hidden weapons. You really feel you are watching a documentary of events from 1963, not a work of fiction shot nine years later.One of the charms of this film is its overwhelming European-ness, from the casual practice of realpolitick (how Zinnemann got French cooperation to shoot a film which portrays their security service as harshly as it does is a wonder) to the way the word \"aluminum\" is pronounced \"al-LOO-min-EE-um\" rather than \"al-LOO-min-um\". It's not quite believable set as it is in the 1960s, with all those people in shaggy haircuts looking at the camera in street scenes, but the location shooting is a definite plus when it comes to establishing \"Jackal's\" rich, lifelike texture.Maintaining suspense is a challenge, for we know De Gaulle will not be killed. It's how the Jackal moves closer to his target, and stays ahead of his pursuers, that makes the film work, the same as it does with the novel.The film does drag, and there are elements that seem to stretch longer than needed, e.g. a car crash that temporarily derails the Jackal or rigorous analysis of a series of torture tapes that yield a vital clue. But the ruthless concentration builds up intense momentum toward a sudden end, and a lingering question: \"Who the hell was he?\" That's the sting at the tail, the Jackal's one undeniable victory and a marvelous endnote for this grimly glorious film.",

            "content": "The plot of this movie involves two men. One man is out to kill De Gaulle, and the other is trying to stop him. Both are professional, and they carry themselves in a professional manner. This is the greatest strength of the movie. Neither Lonsdale or Fox \"act\" in this movie. They don't go for any overblown dramatics or make any big speeches. They focus on the job at hand, which is to portray two men who are solely concerned with their job.This movie is a chess game, played between two professionals at the top of their game. The movie is shown from the perspective of both men. We see the assassin planning and executing this mission, and we see the policeman unraveling the plot, and later pursuing the assassin.There are no leaps of logic or unbelievable coincidences. We see the value of meticulous preparation and of detailed police work. The only lucky break the police get is in the initial discovery of the plot through the abduction of one of the conspirators, a break needed to set up the plot of the movie, but this is the only time that the police get such a break.This movie is well worth watching, not only for the enjoyment of the movie and plot itself, but also to see an excellent example of restrained film making. This is a top notch thriller, one of the best examples of the genre.",

            "content": "I first saw this film as an astonished child, and because it was withdrawn from TV (apparently because its DIY guide to assassination was too informative), it began to grow a talismanic importance in my memories. The reasons for my astonishment were legion.  Here was a film that dared to reject the tyranny of character cinema in favour of pure mathematics. There is a spare, beautiful geometry to the plot.  A wants to shoot B; C wants to protect B; C goes after A.  Nothing is allowed intrude on this angular perfection - the plot is an inexorable tracing of clean lines.I also loved the concomitant fact that the film rejected conventional notions of heroes and villains.  There is no character whatsoever in this film, just parts of the plot's design.  We are frequently shown weapons being pulled apart and put together, trains,. vehicles, roads, and especially clocks - we are simply watching a mechanism, the assemblage of clockwork.  Imagine if THE TERMINATOR was really about the Terminator: JACKAL's characters are all robots, walking through their inevitable paces. This gives the film a strange dreamlike effect.The film is quite sly about its mechanical effect, and plays with our atavistic need for human empathy.  When the Jackal goes to a graveyard, and stands by an infant's grave, we think we might be getting biographical information, an explanation of why he does what he does - maybe this infant was his brother.  But he's only looking for somebody's identity to steal. Later, we are given a travelogue of Paris through his eyes.  This is very attractive and humanising, until we realise that he's looking for a vantage point from which to kill.JACKAL is very brave in never letting this up - as Hollywood proved, his character could be reduced to mush.  Here he remains a killing machine, and the climax is very chilling: the only reason the Jackal doesn't succeed is the purest of chances (this was much more plausible than I'd remembered). This was another reason to love it - the use of the detective story.  Here no crime has been committed - the police are in fact chasing two phantoms - this unknown Jackal, and a projection into the future (the crime).Finally there was the setting, in the world's most enrapturing country, France.Of course, having seen much more films since, JACKAL could only disappoint. The remembered tightness of the plot was actually highly porous, which is normally overlookable, but fatal when the main character IS the plot (see below for an amusing point-by-point review of its flaws).  The film's amorality was still beautiful, but the indifference to actual politics nagged me, although, even if de Gaulle's dodgy track record was overlooked, we got some idea of how close to a police state his France was.Most disappointing though was the direction.  Zinnemann just doesn't seem to know what to do with this wonderful material - it's ironic that his supposedly 'humanist' films are let down by his mechanical direction, and yet he can do nothing but prettify a confection of pure mechanics.  Can you imagine what a work of genius this could have been in Melville's hands? There were two amazing films about hitmen in the decade prior to JACKAL - LE SAMOURAI and IL CONFORMISTA - so this just isn't good enough.And yet it almost is, thanks to Edward Fox.  Although he is still a machine, the most fascinating parts of the film are when he breaks down.  Zinnemann uses some quietly remarkable effects, more effective for them being sparse, of the Jackal losing control, whether it's through slow-motion, breaks in sound, or whatever, which almost confers a Melvillean grace.  These are all the more powerful for not derailing the plot, and not being explained.",

Whether it's the American President, a Dutch politician or someone else, there is always a bullet with someones name on it. In the 1970s, Hollywood created a film version of the fictional attempted assassination of President Charles De Gaulle. Based on the Frederick Forsyth novel, the film adaptation of \"The Day of the Jackal\" is a dark and intelligent affair. Brilliantly acted by Edward Fox and others, it is beautifully shot and tense throughout.President General Charles De Gaulle has granted Algerian Independence. After constantly failing in their attempts to assassinate him, survivors of the now defunct French Foreign Legion know that they can't get anywhere near him. Hiring a mysterious assassin known as 'The Jackal' (Fox) to strike, they set in motion a Europe wide cat and mouse game between the law and the would be killer.From the opening moments, \"The Day of the Jackal\" is an intense and powerful film. Cleverly set out, the entire situation is set up through one short introduction and one brief assassination attempt. From this moment on, the story sets off at lightning speed as Edward Fox's assassin is constantly moving from one place to the next, setting up events which won't happen for a further hour and a half. Fox is awesome as this intellectual killer with a penchant for killing. We are shown a meticulous English gentleman who isn't afraid to break a few necks to achieve his goal.There are some truly awesome moments in this film. Whether it is the fast paced conclusion, the twist at the end, or earlier moments of delight (for example the transformation of the white sports car), there are exquisite parts of this excellent film. Beautifully acted and beautifully thought out, it never allows you to relax and you are enthralled from start to finish. Brilliant.",

            "content": "A superb, tense thriller which unfolds methodically like some amazing documentary, Forsyth's and Zinnemann's tale of political assassination remains one of the best, if not THE Best, of the modern thrillers. The plot involves the latest plan of French extremists to kill French President de Gaulle and takes place in 1963. When I first saw this about 25 years ago, I was almost convinced I was watching an actual chain of historical events, somehow captured by surreptitious cameras all over Europe. The extremists hire an outsider, a professional assassin (the innocuous-seeming Fox), as a last resort. Edward Fox's portrayal of the code-named Jackal is still the greatest interpretation of what a real professional assassin is like. Later films usually depicted assassins as flamboyant, unusual-looking killers, but here it's understood that in order to be successful, such killers need to blend in (even in the remake in '97, though Bruce Willis underplayed, he still stood out in a crowd).This film is also unusual in that the audience is usually following along with the villain, Fox (meticulous in his planning), rather than a hero. When the French authorities get wind of the assassination plot, a cat-and-mouse (or cat-and-rat in this case) game ensues all over Europe, with the cunning Jackal always a step ahead of the combined police forces. We learn a bit about the Jackal as the story progresses - he truly is a cold killer when called for (in his eyes); he's obviously quite intelligent, coldly calculating, and a master planner. He must have a huge ego and loads of arrogance, continuing his plan even when he later knows all of France is aware of him. There's also something of a British aristocratic air about him. But we don't learn all that much - he remains a man of mystery, a strange cypher moving about the environs of Europe. He's a somewhat fascinating character; just count yourself fortunate you never wind up socializing with someone like him in a Turkish bath or similar locales.The rest of the cast are top notch, all character actors who disappear into the roles of supposedly real historical personnel. Lonsdale stands out as the main detective on the case; he's also obviously very intelligent and others are usually underestimating him. You sense he's the only one who has a chance of figuring out the Jackal's next move and perhaps out-thinking him. Even the Jackal admits early on that de Gaulle has the best security force in the world! But, in the end, the Jackal really proves to be smarter than all the law-enforcement officials. It's a fitting, perfect finale to the lengthy chase. Really excellent.",

It's shot in France, Italy and England - so, it preserves some charm for this part of Europe for times past and long gone.

Two women participate in the Movie - Delphine Seyrig as middle-aged Frenchwoman who is killed after an affair with the Jackal; plus, Olga Georges-Picot as Denise (his link to Algerian terrorists that pay half million dollars for targeting the President).

            "review_title": "Zinnemann's direction is as meticulous as the Jackal's planning",
            "content": "In a distinguished career littered with classics, Austrian-born American film director Fred Zinnemann did some of his best work in Britain. Having won the Academy Award for Best Director for A Man for All Seasons (which won the best film award not only at the Oscars, but also the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs), he followed it up - albeit belatedly - with The Day of the Jackal. Zinnemann's 1973 adaptation of Frederick Forsyth's celebrated thriller didn't win as many awards at its predecessor, but it has since gained a reputation as one of the best British films.\nThe Day of the Jackal concerns an attempt to assassinate French President Charles De Gaulle by the titular assassin and the attempts by the French Deputy Police Commissioner Claude Lebel to identify and stop him. That, in essence, is the sum total of the film's (and the original novel's) story. It has had many imitators (and one poorly received remake), but the reason the simple premise manages to thoroughly grip the audience for a little over two and a quarter hours is because of the way the plot unfolds and because the film is astonishingly well made.\nMuch of the thrill of the film lies in letting the audience follow the Jackal from the moment that he is hired by the dissident OAS to his fateful attempt to carry out the assassination. Whilst the story is fictional, history allows one to conclude correctly that he will fail, but this fact does little to dispel the suspense. What really captivates however is observing the Jackal's careful, meticulous planning, which takes up most of the film's running time. The level of detail shown on screen might have been mind-numbing, but instead is fascinating. Once it is also intertwined with Lebel's methodical attempts to identify, locate and stop him, it becomes even more fascinating and by the end of the film, the audience might find itself wondering who to root for - Lebel or the Jackal.\nSeveral factors contribute to the power of the film to captivate, including Forsyth's original story and Kenneth Ross' screenplay. The acting is another: Zinnemann reportedly resisted the pressure to cast a well-known star as the Jackal, instead offering the part to Edward Fox, who gives a career-defining performance as the cold, professional, suave killer. Fox gives him the polite affability of an English tourist, and yet constantly conveys an air of suppressed danger; it is easy to understand how he can seduce both men and women during the course of the film, and equally easy to believe that he is a ruthless killer. He contrasts neatly with Michael Lonsdale's softly-spoken, diligent Claude Lebel, and both are surrounded by the cream of (mostly) British acting talent, including Cyril Cusack, Derek Jacobi, Maurice Denham, Vernon Dobtcheff, Anton Rodgers and Timothy West, many of whom play bit parts.\nAnd of course the final huge factor in the film's success is Zinnemann himself. He shoots it like a documentary or newsreel, with virtually no non-diagetic soundtrack and a meticulous attention to detail that mirrors that of the Jackal. The air of realism is enhanced by the extensive location filming, and the use of a real 14th July parade during the climax (the fact that the opening scenes recreate an actually historic attempt on De Gaule's life - a detail taken from Forsyth's novel - also of course helps); it is undermined only by the use of anachronistic vehicles (which most viewers won't notice) and the slightly odd mix of accents resulting from French characters being played both by French and British actors.\nThere are many candidates for the title of Fred Zinnemann's best film and High Noon or A Man for All Seasons would probably win. But The Day of the Jackal is certainly a contestant: it's incredibly well-made, utterly gripping, and certainly one of the British film industry's very best thrillers.",

Veteran director Fred Fenneman, best-known for \"High Noon\" and \"From Here to Eternity\", does a masterful job of capturing the post-war tensions swirling through Europe by showing us an assassination plot against Pres. DeGaulle of France through the eyes of the people directly involved. A feeling of war-time intrigue pervades the story even though it is set in 1963, 18 years after the liberation of Paris by the Allies.  While the Allied governments continue to celebrate past victories, we get the sense that there are many issues left unresolved, scars that haven't yet healed.Enter \"the Jackal\", a suave, young assassin played by Edward Fox. France's Secret Army Organization (OAS) wants to kill DeGaulle; they explain that \"we are patriots, not terrorists.\"  Mr. \"Jackal\" doesn't care: his price is \"Half a million -- Dollars, not francs.\" That was a LOT of money back in 1963, but the \"patriots\" have no choice -- their own attempts have failed miserably, and they have only one chance left.There is a definite \"Holmes vs. Moriarity\" feel to the chase that ensues between the Jackal and the hapless French detective assigned to find him. The assassin changes identities like he changes clothes, leaving a trail of bodies in his wake; plus the detective must deal with an informant tied into France's Cabinet of Ministers. Director Fenneman lets the plot thicken slowly and carefully, with an eye to detail and nuance that is rarely seen in modern films.Add this DVD to your collection.

Maybe not as much as I thought I would, but it certainly offers a decent bit to like.This film does a fine job at showing how the two main characters, the Jackal and Lebel, work to opposite purposes. The former works at carrying out the assassination, while the latter works at trying to stop him. As the films rolls along, the Jackal gets closer and closer to the president as bodies keep piling up around him. This is set against the procedural elements of Lebel trying to track him down throughout the film. This element persists all throughout the film and grows in intensity the further you get into the film, specifically during the last act once Lebel begins running out of time to stop the Jackal. Both the Jackal and Lebel were smart, competent characters, which made them an enjoyable pair to watch.Though you'll probably side with Lebel, both characters can be hypnotic to watch. With the Jackal, I found myself drawn to the sense of solitude he displayed throughout the film. When he had to kill people, for instance, he went about these acts with a sense of tranquility. He'd calmly move to them and murder them fairly quickly, without them being able to scream, fight back, or resist. It's clear he's had enough experience with his profession to the point he knows exactly how to handle any situation which arises. The occasional slip up will come off as a huge surprise. Not only to the viewer, but also to the Jackal since it's implied he almost never runs into them. Overall, I found it interesting to watch the Jackal go about his task and deal with the various problems which arose along the way.I don't have much to offer in the way of flaws, except I did feel the film's runtime at certain points, especially during the middle. However, I imagine it will flow smoother with another viewing. As it stands, this film currently stands at a low 8/10 for me, but I may enjoy it more if I watch it again.",

            "content": "Based on Frederick Forsyth's novel, \"The Day of the Jackal\" is settled in France during General De Gaulle's presidency where a group of former Desert Legion officers (the O.A.S.) that feel betrayed by the president's policy to give independence to France's African colonies, decide to have him killed for treason. After failing in their own intents, they hire a professional to do the job. From then on Fred Zinnemann builds a great film shot on location through Europe and aided by a very good screenplay and photography.The first part of The Day of the Jackal deals with the Jackal's meticulous planning and preparation for the murder (where?, when?, how?); and the second half with the execution of his plan. Both parts are most interesting and well handled and lead to the splendid final sequences when you even doubt whether the man has succeeded or not. The film is a perfect cat and mouse chase as the French Secret Service -that knows a killer will attempt against the President- does his job too and starts to run against time.Edward Fox, a fine British actor, plays the Jackal most convincingly and some how you feel kind of sorry for his bad luck at the last minute (considering this is a movie we are talking about, of course); the man is a true professional with no feelings or scruples when it comes to his work. The French officer assigned to stop him is played by Michael Lonsdale in perhaps his best performance in movies. He is a true professional too.\"The Day of the Jackal\" lasts 2 and a half hours, but you can be sure you'll enjoy every minute of it if you like political thrillers with a real fact background (the OAS really existed and attempted against Charles de Gaulle several times). The 1997 remake with Richard Gere and Bruce Willis though perhaps entertaining is clearly inferior to this one.",

British actor Edward Fox is the blonde foreigner who moves from one European capital to another as he prepares to cash in on the biggest assignment of his career. The film is long but moves at a good clip and is gripping throughout and the suspense and planning are what carry the film to its climactic endgame. There is almost no musical accompaniment in the movie as the Jackal meticulously plans for the big moment. His path crosses with interesting, if not sympathetic, characters as he closes in on his quarry, and the film becomes a game of chess between the assassin and French detective Claude Lebel. Director Fred Zinnemann's picture is truly a classic work that may never be equaled for its professional look and presentation, great cast, and wonderful drama.",

What a great thriller this ended up being, I went to watch it not knowing much about it and it was a great experience. The acting is great, I really like Edward Fox as the Jackal and also Michael Lonsdale as his nemesis but. What I espeacily love about this film it's how it doesn't only follow the point of view of the assassin but also the eforts of french police to stop him giving us a perspective of the immense work going into finding the identity of the assassin and later into finding him. I think the last part of the film is great and extremely suspenseful even though the ending is a bit disapointing with the Jackal getting caught without killing the president, made even more disapointing since it's very unlikely that they would have been able to spot him and that a professional like him would miss his first shot.\n8.8/10",

The style is therefore nothing new. We have almost come to expect it. And here Zinnerman directs him with typically cold-cunning effect. There's a number of other British character stalwarts, and several French actors providing an authentic flavour to what is ultimately their own national crisis.Although the whole movie has a nicely-paced plot with plenty of dramatic moments, the effect has a rather starched feel to it. Tension never really seems to build. We see the Jackal murdering accomplices and innocent stooges alike; we see him narrowly escape capture; he even has a road accident. But there is no cumulative effect. They are like a series of minutely-observed tableaux. Some have described it as almost a documentary; yet it still lacks some essential component to transpose the story into drama. I never got to know the Jackal as a human being. His willingness to murder suggests a psychotic mentality. His protagonist French detective is equally two-dimensional. And I think therein lies the problem. Story is 'something that happens to someone you have been moved to care about'. In this movie, Zinnerman signally failed to induce my empathy for anyone.Still well worth a watch for the meticulous realisation of the murder plot and its ultimate thwarting, but I find it an unsatisfying experience for all of that.",

Anyone who crosses him does so at their peril; anyone who asks questions or who might reveal details about him, likewise. His cold, calculating efficiency must be the envy of many real assassins out there.The supporting cast is stellar, perhaps not to an American audience but certainly to a British one - Eric Porter, Timothy West, Alan Badel, Derek Jacobi, Cyril Cusack, Ronald Pickup, Donald Sinden, Terence Alexander, Tony Britton, Bernard Archard, Maurice Denham - the list goes on and few films have ever attracted such a cast.The tenor of the film is outstanding. Fox's attention to detail, as exemplified by his careful adjustments to the accuracy of his rifle, and also the detailed way in which his adversary, the French police commissioner played by a superbly cool and calm Michael Lonsdale, approaches his own task, speak to the fantastic tension that develops as the two seek to achieve their objectives - the Jackal's to complete his deadly mission and the Commissioner's to stop him.The action is wonderfully taut, there are no wasted scenes and no unnecessary dialogue. Everything about this film screams quality. There are no histrionics, no rushing around, no silly heroics; the protagonist has no super powers and to all appearances is a perfectly ordinary Englishman, albeit one on a mission.Without doubt, it's one of the finest mystery thrillers ever made, and we still don't know the Jackal's real name !",

I mean The French Connection had more people speaking French! Maybe I shouldn't be surprised, especially as I guess in Valkyrie hardly anyone spoke German! At least in Allo Allo, some of the performers had French accents, even if they weren't French.The pacing was sort of okay, but still, it could have been better paced.

            "content": "The Day of the Jackal is the fictional story of an assassin hired by the OAS (a French right-wing terrorist group that was active in the 1960s) to kill President Charles de Gaulle. This film was an adaptation of Fredrick Forsyth's novel of the same title.I've already laid down the basic plot, but I'll elaborate on the story. After a failed attempt on de Gaulle, the leader of the OAS (Col. Bastien-Thiry) is executed and Col. Rodin assumes control. Col. Rodin and the other two top OAS men decide to hire a contract killer who only they know the true identity of to assassinate de Gaulle. The Jackal has one contact in Paris who keeps him informed, but does not know who he is. The French authorities know that the OAS is planning something and kidnap Rodin's adjunct. Under torture, the adjunct reveals the only thing he knows, the killer's code name; The Jackal. Naturally, after some investigation, French security determines there is a plot to kill de Gaulle and have Police Commissioner Lebel investigate.This is as deep into the plot as I'll go because I don't want to give anything away. What makes this story interesting is that French security and OAS know only of his existence and his code name. In addition, the Jackal's disguises and tricks of the trade (for lack of a better term) are fascinating. The thing that I really enjoy about this movie is the cast. Many fine actors from both Britian and France were used (Michel Lonsdale, Derek Jacobi, and Eric Porter to name several). However, Edward Fox gave probably the finest performance as the Jackal. He's cold, effective, and calculating the very essence of a contract killer.The movie does not completely follow the book. Some say the movie is awful, some say the movie's good despite the differences. Personally, I am of the latter opinion. Why not find out for yourself?Either way, it's a lot better than the Bruce Willis version.",

            "content": "I've watched a lot of thrillers of this era and it seems to me that \"Day of the Jackal\" is the cream of the crop. The story of a far-right group's attempt to assassinate French president Charles de Gaul in 1963, this movie isn't particularly political in nature - it really isn't concerned with arguing to the viewer that one side or the other was correct. I'm convinced that this is actually good for a thriller, as it lets it concentrate on, you know, thrilling the audience, rather than delivering some political sermon, which will inevitably distract some or all of the audience from the suspense. The source material, the Frederick Forsythe novel, helps the movie in that it was, for its day, an apparently accurate imagining of how one would go about assassinating a world leader, exploiting holes in security that existed at the time to generate fake identities, smuggle weapons past customs and security, and so on, to the extent that the novel was a bit of an embarrassment to various countries when reporters learned the tactics it describes actually would work. Part of a thriller is realism - it's hard to care about characters and events we don't feel are realistic, it's why we laugh at deaths in dumb action movies and cry at deaths during say, Schindler's List - so the realism has to be an asset here. The movie is steeped in realism, down to the assassin's gun-maker describing why mercury is the best chemical to use in making explosive bullets, or how he had to use stainless steal for the gun's barrel. A major reason this movie works is it's not full of unrealistic \"Hollywood\" constructions and tricks but you actually feel like what's going on is a pretty accurate depiction of an attempted political assassination.The movie's direction is top-notch, weaving together the stories of the right wing conspirators, the political and police investigation into the assassin, and of course the assassin himself as they all get closer and closer to the moment of truth. It is all done in carefully edited interchanging scenes - we might see a spy seducing a top government official in one scene, and just before it gets tedious there's a cut to the assassin going about another stage in his planning. It's generally done quite well, building the tension in a way somewhat similar to the classic police procedural \"The Naked City\" which ends similarly with a highly energetic climax, the natural way to end the slow and deliberate build.If the movie does have a fault, it seems to be the middling section just before the Jackal arrives in Paris where he is involved in a car wreck. I fail to see what this really adds to the story except length, and it confounds the story of his relationship with the french Noblewoman, and is the only part of the movie that veers slightly into not seeming realistic. Still, the movie adaptation does thankfully shorten the novel's unnecessarily complicated treatment of the Jackal courting a homosexual Parisian to provide him with cover.I have now seen most of the big-budget thrillers of the 1970s and I must say \"Day of the Jackal\" is at the top of the list. It's one of the more engaging movies I've seen lately. It's a shame that its lack of star power seems to have doomed it to obscurity.",

            "content": "The late 60s and early 70s were the golden age of a certain breed of spy/espionage/conspiracy movie. Think such films as \"The Parallax View\", \"The Conversation\", \"Three Days of the Condor\", \"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold\", \"All the President's Men\", \"Capricorn One\", \"Chinatown\", \"The China Syndrome\", \"Executive Action\", \"The Conformist\", \"The Manchurian Candidate\" \"Marathon Man\", \"Black Sunday\", \"The Mackintosh Man\", \"The Odessa File\", \"Executive Action\", \"Seven Days In May\" and the political thrillers of Costa Gavras, Gillo Pontecorvo, Hitchcock and Jean-Pierre Melville.One of the most famous of these is Fred Zinnemann's \"The Day of the Jackal\", which stars Edward Fox as \"The Jackal\", an assassin hired by ex-army extremists to murder Charles de Gaulle, the French leader who upset many by announcing his plans to grant Algeria its independence. Michel Lonsdale, a familiar face in spy movies, is cast as the shrewd police inspector hot on the Jackal's tale.Touted by Zinnemann as an antidote to the then hugely popular James Bond movies, the film dispassionately watches as the Jackal slowly and methodically plots murder. The film offers little conventional action and violence (its most violent scene consists of a watermelon exploding), Zinnemann content to observe from afar as apparently mild mannered gentlemen talk about contracts, future kills, counterfeiting and the building of specialist weapons. The Jackal is himself portrayed as a somewhat aristocratic, upper class Englishman. A man for whom killing is a respectable business when done with care and finesse. Mirrored to the Jackal are a band of police inspectors, equally methodical, dispassionate and efficient. The action bounces from London to Paris to Vienna to Rome, a form of globe trotting typical of the genre. Zinnemann juxtaposes those whom the Jackal relies on \u2013 gunsmiths, forgers, underground hoodlums \u2013 with those upon whom the police depend.As with most of these films, it is a woman (and possibly also homosexuality?) who causes our hero's plans to collapse. This is an off-shoot of noir, untameable women bleeding into a forever conspiratorial cosmos.The film's primary influences are Jean-Pierre Melville and Hitchcock. Melville for its detached, procedural-like narrative devoid of humour and overt psychological analysis (\"The Samurai\", \"Army of Shadows\" etc) and Hitchcock for the wry, devilish pleasure Zinnemann takes in watching evils planned and committed with utmost civility. \"Will the gentleman be moving?\" a gentlemanly gunsmith asks the gentlemanly Jackal, referring to the gentlemanly General Charles de Gaulle. Tonally it's \"Dial M For Murder\", little devils plotting devilish deeds with much formality.8/10 \u2013 One of Zinnemann's better films, though overlong and with little replay value. Worth one viewing.",

The pace is amazing,and the director's mastership is undeniable.To sum up,in this excellent suspense show we have Fox' outstanding role as the Jackal,a logical and well developed script,plenty of action,a gorgeous pace,an interesting subject,two attractive actresses.\"Day of the Jackal\" has intelligence and charm,it is an intelligent movie,and an elegant one;it has no ballast,and it is entirely suited to its purpose,a movie to enjoy,to take delight in;the few very good actors it has are in a prodigious form.",

This has all the elements of all the great films from the late 60's & early 70's except that as per the norms of the day not very much attention was paid to \"certain period\" accurate detail. Although the film is suppose to take place in 1962-3 the filmmakers did not use much discretion in hiding early 70's haircuts, fashion or automobiles. Back in those days audiences/studios were not too picky about authenticity. I am sure the original audience did not notice these flaws and since people as a group have short memories and do not like or know too much about history, modern audiences would not know the difference between 1963 and 1973 fashions, etc. by now either. So the filmmakers won that battle then and now about covering up their sins. Except that I am a \"history-buff\" and noticed quite a few of these flaws throughout the entire film.\nThere is also the much done unrealistic \"surveillance footage\" sequence in the film that few films get right. Film footage is shown of Viktor, a suspicious character with a small briefcase hand cuffed to his wrist, who is on constant alert for anyone following/watching him yet the footage shows him passing the \"unseen\" cameraman within 2 feet of the lens. I will give the film the benefit of the doubt that he did not hear the \"WHIR\" of the 16mm cameras gears turning since he is out in public and in a crowd but how could he possibly not notice a surveillance man holding even a small sized 16mm camera directly at him within touching reach. If it had been shot with a long lens then the cameraman \"could\" have been said to be hiding, but it was not. There is another scene when the Jackal \"strangles\" a woman he had hooked up with earlier and whom the police had interviewed before he came back to have a 2nd taste of her honey, in the act of strangulation, done in shadows. she acts as if she is drugged rather than being suffocated to death with zero thrashing around or reaction at all. Finally, when Lebel tracks the Jackal down just as he is about to assassinate de Gaulle, Lebel grabs a machine pistol and shoots him and the Jackal goes flying against the wall like he was hit by a shotgun. The machine pistol that he uses is not \"that\" powerful to accomplish that.\nFred Zinnemann is a very skilled director and he added nice touches throughout the film like when the Jackal talks to his gun maker about the specs for the rifle he needs made for the assassination he is about to commit, there is a magazine open with a picture of Kennedy on the coffee table. On the street there is a musician playing Colonel Bogey's theme from the Bridge on the River Kwai on an accordion.\nIt is interesting and ironic that in real life de Gaulle would in only a couple of months time, in the movie's plot time period, attend President Kennedy's funeral after the events of this film's depiction of attempts at his own life were thwarted.",

Don't get me wrong, (spoiler...) the good guys do win, but the real good guy, the one who you've cried with, cheered for, and smiled at throughout the movie, does not survive. Edward Fox plays the Jackal perfectly. He is carefree with others' lives, but with his own, he missteps not once. The problem with his position was the ease in which a government can keep track of things, which we should be happy about, unless our career is in the line of assassination. The use (or lack thereof) of an in-depth movie score is captivating, a key part in the thrill. Also, the lazing nudity is somewhat awkward, but well placed. It is not over done, nor is it hidden. It is there, and very natural. It is amazing how Zinneman does not over-emphasize the Jackal's death. It is simple, no blood, no screams, just bullets and a burial.

The Jackal himself is so ingenious that one cannot help wishing him to succeed - hands up all those who grin when he does not take that turning for Italy. Though - not wanting to spoil the fun - we do feel that Lonsdale is formidable in his pursuit.\nAs for the sentiments of other users that the film is slow; the pace is unrelenting in its furthering of the plot - there are no superfluous elements and one need look no further than how quickly the film ends once the final nail is in the coffin to see where the film's sympathies lie in terms of indulgent elaboration. So many of today's films lack this concise execution and the confidence that a story can be told in actions and significant dialogue without incessant (and largely visceral) use of music and trendy editing.Thus, Day of The Jackal stands the test of time to rival most modern thrillers - strip the latter of their various production value gimmicks and one is rarely left with such a sturdy yarn as this.

            "content": "The fictional story of The Jackal(though I do believe that there once existed a man with the very same codename and of the same profession; well, technically, he still does exist, as he's still alive, but incarcerated) is a great piece of literature(so I understand; unfortunately, I haven't had the pleasure of reading the book by Frederick Forsyth myself, but I understand it's excellent). Fortunately, it translates onto the silver screen pretty well. Unfortunately, it didn't get a better director than Fred Zinnemann, who I haven't seen other films by, but I assume he just either didn't \"get it\" enough to do it right, or he just lacked the talent to keep the story interesting and give it the amount of tension that it needs. However, whatever it is, it's certainly too bad. The story is great; the film could have been too. The plot is very, very good, but it drags a little too much, and the pace is too slow for a movie that expects you to sit through 145 minutes, just under two and a half hours. The direction is a little sloppy, and unless you're very interested in knowing about The Jackal and his mission, which I admittedly was the first time I saw it, you probably won't sit through the entire thing, simply because in the end, it's just too stale and boring. The acting is good; I didn't find any of the characters poorly portrayed. The characters are well-written and credible, but I'm not sure whether to chalk that up to Forsyth or the scriptwriter. From what I understand, the film is a fairly good and accurate depiction of the book. The cinematography is nothing special. The film doesn't do that good a job of creating suspense or tension. The direction is, like I said, somewhat stale. Unless you're very interested in watching an accurate, realistic and fairly thorough depiction of how a truly professional assassin goes about assassinating one of the most powerful men in the world, you won't enjoy this movie. That digs quite a chunk out of the audience, I would imagine. Then again, maybe there are a lot of people who, like me, enjoy watching an entirely professional assassin conduct \"business\". All in all, a fairly good thriller, but only for a limited crowd and doesn't stand repetition too good, since, well, once you know how it ends, the film has nothing left to offer, apart from the good story, which you might as well read(since, by most accounts, the book is better). I recommend it to fans of films dealing with assassins and assassinations, as well as very big fans of thrillers. If you do not like this movie within the first few minutes, then you most likely won't like it at all. Just a little warning to those who find the direction as bland as I do. Good, but could(and most certainly should) have been great. 8/10",

            "content": "A classic text book example of making an exciting thriller. All praise\ngoes to great director Fred Zinnemann for his brilliantly executed\nexample of film making. This is again a very good example of telling a\ncomplex plot with clarity. The visualization of the thrilling best\nseller book (written by Frederick Forsythe) is so convincing that you\ncan't find single fault. It's not suspense thriller & yet you can't\nkeep your eyes off for a single minute & that's the real beauty of the\nfilm. It's story of a code name of professional killer \"Jackal\", who\nwas hired to assassinate the French president by a group of French\npeople. The portrayal of \"Jackal\" is suave & smart & Edward Fox has\nplayed his part with impeccable performance picking the minute details\nof smart assassin characteristic traits. The movie is shot with\ndetailing exterior of 70's France & not in Studio. The movie also\nsuggests the commending work of French Police investigation very\nexhaustively but \"Jackal\" is smart & how can they stop him is a thing\nto watch rather than make you read the spoiler. I also appreciate the\nparticularity of planning of assassin; whether it's getting false\npassport or driving license, getting disguises, carrying a lightweight\nthin smart sniper gun etc. etc. The movie is 2 hour 20 minutes\nunstoppable journey of thrill.One of the finest thrilling movie of 70's. Do I have to say- \"Must\nwatch\"?Ratings-9/10",

            "review_title": "Brilliant thriller",
            "content": "After yet another assassination attempt on President Charles De Gaulle fails, and most of the group now arrested, the O.A.S. decides to hire an outsider to get the job done. When French officials find out someone has been hired, they understandably panic, especially when de Gaulle's liaison tells them that the investigation must be conducted in absolute secrecy. The leader of the investigation, Lebel, is sharp, but is he sharp enough to figure out who The Jackal is without any clues to his identity?\nThe Day Of The Jackal is a superb thriller directed by Fred Zinnermann and based on the novel by Fredrick Forsyth. It was released in 1973 and looks very dated now, however, it is still an excellent movie.\nEdward Fox is excellent as the professional hitman, code-named 'The Jackal'. This is a man who is suave, sophisticated and displays a cold detachment especially when it comes to his interaction with people, and those people he interacts with are only necessary to help him get closer to his goal. He is completely driven to achieve his goal. Even when his contact at the O.A.S. informs him that the authorities are aware of the plot, he still goes ahead with his plans regardless, assuming he still had the upper hand.\nThe great thing about this 'villain', is that there is nothing over the top about him. He's anonymous, blends in, quiet, and despite his intent, you almost feel admiration for him without actually rooting for him,\nMichel Lonsdale plays Lebel and does such a brilliant job. There is frustration at all the secrecy he has to abide by but will go to any length to get the job done. In one terrific scene, he is at the meeting of all the senior officials involved in the investigation, and knowing that information has been leaked to The Jackal, keeping him one step ahead of the police at all times, and that leak came from one of the officials present, he plays a recording from a bug in the officials home. When asked how he knew which of the official's home telephones to bug, he replies coolly \"I didn't, so I bugged them all\".\nThe only two main female characters in this film are both beautiful and integral to the plot. One is an insider of the O.A.S. who is sleeping with the official to gain the much-needed information about what the authorities know and get it passed on to the Jackal. The other is an innocent woman whom the Jackal meets at a hotel he is hiding out in, and seduces her, sleeps with her and you actually believe he likes her. However, when the police discover the fact that he is at the hotel, the Jackal has already moved on and he ends up at the woman's home. It transpires that she is aware that he is a wanted man and he ends up calmly killing her to ensure her silence.\nGiven the fact that this is a film about a man out to assassinate a real-life figure, and we know that said figure wasn't assassinated in real life, you would think this film would be free of any suspense cause we know how it will end, but that's not the case at all. This is an incredibly gripping film, and it draws you in, building the tension as the day of the assassination draws nearer.\nThe film, by today's standard, seems slow but that is what makes it so good. There is no ridiculous exposition all the time, there aren't any stylistic flourishes or action sequences, the last 15 mins of the movie has hardly any dialogue but yet is incredibly exciting, and all this is down to the excellent direction of Zinnermann, who was responsible for directing classics like 'High Noon', 'From Here To Eternity' and even the movie adaptation of 'Oklahoma!'\nThe whole cast is fantastic and made up of, at the time, relatively unknowns. To have had a 'star' play the Jackal would have, in my opinion, taken away the mystique of the character. The supporting cast was made up of TV and theatre stars of the time. Tony Britton plays the British Inspector, Derek Jacobi plays Lebel's assistant Caron, Ronald Pickup as The Forger. Timothy West, Cyril Cusack, Donald Sinden and Maurice Denham also appear.\nThis is a truly clever, gripping and classic thriller which, although didn't do well at the box office on its release, probably due to the lack of a 'star' name, garnered enormous praise from critics and despite it's 'dated' look, still holds up today.\nI just love it and am happy to highly recommend it for any DVD collection.",

It is a great film by a great director. Fred Zinnemann had a long distinguished career in film making and is probably under rated today. It is a seemingly simply made film, but no scene is too long, no dialogue is too verbose, no performance too melodramatic. It is a great orchestration of the elements of film.As the Jackal Edward Fox is magnetic. It may well have been his best work as a film actor. You are drawn and repelled by him. There are scenes without him but his intelligent, cool and determined assassin hovers over the whole film. The scenes where he kills are understated, filmed in low light, and thus more disturbing. As the pursuing policeman Lebel, Michel Lonsdale is equally excellent. More of him in the film would have been great. The other actors give good support. Cyril Cusack as the gunsmith and Ronald Pickup as the forger are particularly creepy.In comparison the 1997 re-make is poor. Why try to rebuild Mount Everest?",

And the secret to its success is the almost anonymous cast. Of course we recognize the horse face of Fox, but he is rarely the lead. And of Lonsdale, he has that career beauracrat look down perfect, almost as if Maigret had been called to the scene.

Michael Lonsdale as well is dead on as the soft spoken but knows his business Detective assigned the seemingly impossible task of finding the person no one knows. The film never loses the viewers interest even during some of the slow scenes. The dual story line i.e. the plot to assassinate and the job of trying  to stop the assassination is handled very well.

She knew nothing about him and couldn't have been a threat to him.

            "content": "But don't go see it again if you like to keep it in favorable memory. We liked it a lot the 1st time and made that mistake to watch it again: it revealed a riddle of flaws. How can a deGaulle! assassin in a 'can never work again' job, not have a backup ( hand-) weapon? But lets not get ahead of ourselves. 140 gunshots in 7 seconds - we witness how the rear window of deGaulle's Citroen shatters and falls out, so the back of his head and his shoulders, become visible. Yet when he arrives minutes later in that same car, the rear window is almost completely in place again. Mr.Jackal was presented as an intellectual ( and experienced ) assassin, but Zinnemann made him throw a suitcase ( which did not cross the border with him ) into plain sight knowing the cops are on Mr.Jackal's trail. And leave the scene of a license-plates-theft in sight of the victims, where the natural thing is to avoid being seen. Three sections of his gun tubes would not fit inside the Alfa Romeo exhaust pipe shown : recognize the 'cut' between wrapping and shoving it in. And how did he smuggle i.e where did he hide the rest of his crutches-assembly ? The lil' Alfa don't have enough hidden spaces. If it is midnight in Paris, it's not \"7\" in D.C. -not am nor pm- and NOPE no daylight saving in '63. There was no paint-gun yet operable at 12v (invented 1971) Accident-scene: if the driver of the Peugoet 404 died in this crash, there was a considerable 2nd impact-site. And sure the cops were able to tell there was a 2nd vehicle involved in the accident. How then can LeBel order only 10km radius search and ...'watch for 2 suitcases' ... ???? No 40yr old average human being suffocates another 40yr old healthy human in 10sec with bare hands ( or get them unconscious and kill ) without a sound or struggle. If you are 70+ yrs of age, would you climb the top of a 30ft ladder to break thru a window when the hallway-door to that same room has a handle and a key-hole ? Tulle station, machine-gun flic. Q \"Danish?\" A \"Please?\" and then Q \"What is your business here?\" A \"I'm a schoolteacher on holiday\" After pretending not to understand the word \"Danish?\" every cop in the world would've arraigned 'Mr.Lundquist' after his 2nd answer.That \"midday train to Paris\" has 3 different engines. The 1st minister-meeting was from 7pm to about 10pm. According to the light however, LeBel's wife ran to the dove-house to tell about Berthier's car late morning or early pm. And when LeBel arrived, the ministers hallways were showered in mid-daylight.Mr. Duggan could not have been Mr.Duggan anywhere; according to LeBel the passport was issued JUL.30th and quoting LeBel \" no need to go back any further \"France's entire law-apparatus at LeBel's descretion was hunting the wrong car : the Alfa's license plate was not GE1741 as LeBel had his assistant write down.From LeBel's office to Gare Austerlitz was more than 30minutes - under good circumstances thru 1963 Paris' street-traffic. It is also said in another IMDb'ers comment that they certainly had plenty of manpower at a major Paris-train station. A simple phone-call would've accomplished a better job. The 'rushing-to-the-train' scene is complete nonsense whichever way you look at it. Was there a problem with the film's budget, that Zinnemann couldn't afford to avoid ( or cut ) vehicles that didn't yet exist ? In '63 there were no BMX bikes in Genova or anywhere on this globe, no Renault R16, Peugeot 504 or 304, Vespa Scooters with square headlights, no Citroen Limousines with 'chinese' around-the-curve looking headlights ( we're sure you can find 2doz more wrong 'voitures' ). This piece became a science-fiction. Or is Pontius Pilate starting Ben Hur's race with a flare-gun and 'The Godfather' driving Ford Mondeo's and Chevy Lumina's ?And once LeBel discovered the open window - his logical and fastest option ( duty? ) to prevent the Jackal, was to get to deGaulle less than 10sec away. Not climb 6 flights by foot to \"top floor\" for a shootout. Compare the explosion of the melon with the tiny \" puff \" of Jackal's shot at DeGaulle. An explosive bullet would've caused a 5inch crater in the cobble-stones, not to speak of the 150 'dezibel' at impact less than 5ft from DeGaulle's head. In a 100ft diameter everyone would 'duck away' after such a bullet's impact on granite. It is human reflex.*** All those things can truly 'disenchant' \u0096 it'll throw you off as they say. Zinnemann and Ross budged massively.However much of the above we didn't recognize quite AS badly at first watch, 'cause plot and places ( thanks to FF ) are pleasurable and manage to distract and occupy.",

There are few renowned stories in any medium in which nothing of any note occurs.But throughout film history, befuddled film-makers who have no idea what they're exploring, foist something onto an audience that has no reason for existing; Movies like Falling In Love (a complete fizzle with DeNiro & Streep), Kubrick's The Killing... Day of the Jackal. These films lack anything of substance or meaning occurring along the way, and frequently lack a climax of any sort. In all their details, it's not possible for them to stray from the central idea, because there is no central idea. With other duds (The Royal Tannenbaums) a viewer is unable to say what the hell it was even about, except that Wes Anderson collected a bunch of Neat-O scenes he wanted to film, to make himself look hip. Vacuity.I cannot even get my mind around what the appeal was supposed to be for this fictional assassination attempt ...which fails. (!?) The narrative form didn't arise to tell stores in which nothing of interest occurs, en route to a faled larger event, which was in itself a complete fabrication. What? We have such strong need for anti-climaxes, that we have to invent stories of things not happening?",

            "content": "Fourteen years old is a very impressionable age. That's how old I was when I saw THE DAY OF THE JACKAL for the first time-in a movie theatre, where it was meant to be seen. In addition to larger than life images projected on a giant movie screen long before the days of smaller multiplex cinemas, JACKAL also had a largely unknown cast, certainly all unknown to me. That gave this already realistic film involving historical characters (namely, French President Charles de Gaulle) a pseudo-documentary feeling to it and an element of authenticity that transcended that of a normal drama.\nI'd never heard of Edward Fox. His cool, deadly demeanour as the Jackal is totally believable and even watching the film now on this brilliant new Blu-ray release from MVD entertainment group, he's as real and compelling as ever. Throughout the numerous sequences without dialogue, Fox communicates the calculating, devious mind that drives the Jackal on his murderous quest. Capable of charming men or women one moment or being an assassin the next, Fox dominates the screen with a star-making performance. It didn't hurt that Edward's brother James had been an established star who bowed out of the profession in 1970 for a decade to re-evaluate what was important to him, (namely his spiritual life, but that's another topic for another day). Suffice to say, the Fox name was known, which certainly helped Edward, though his searing talent was and is obvious to this day.\nLike so many \"big break\" stories, director Fred Zinnemann had seen Fox in a low-key British film, THE GO-BETWEEN, and was impressed by the way Fox delivered a particular line of dialogue. ONE LINE got Fox the role of a life-time! It is fascinating details like that one that permeate the extra features. A new interview running over 30 minutes with respected author Neil Sinyard is intelligent and articulate. Sinyard shares details about the making of the film as well as Zinnemann's career in general. A couple of vintage behind-the-scenes interviews pale in comparison, although the bits with Zinnemann himself speaking (in French) are interesting. Sinyard, a very highly-regarded film historian, gives an interview the like should accompany all \"DVD extras\". He increases your appreciation for this fine film with virtually every detail he shares.\nBack to the film. The other \"unknown\" actors are a gallery of brilliant performers headed by French actor Michel Lonsdale as police inspector Claude Lebel, who is leading the search for the Jackal to stop him in his attempt to assassinate President de Gaulle. The rest of the actors, certainly the best-known ones, include Derek Jacobi, Alan Badel, Terence Alexander, Anton Rogers, Maurice Denham, Ronald Pickup, Cyril Cusack and many more...\nZinnemann's direction is precise and calculated for maximum impact, almost as if he were the Jackal as filmmaker. The pacing, the production values, the performances-everything holds up and surpasses, in this viewer's opinion, most of the films produced today. Zinnemann was a master near the end of his career, still able to deliver the goods, in full awareness of what makes a good film and how to entertain and impact an audience.\nIf you are enthralled by political thrillers, this is one of the best. Ever.",

            "content": "Set from 1962 to 1963, the far right organization OAS infuriated by French President Charles de Gaulle's granting independence to Algeria makes an attempt on de Gaulle's life that fails. With OAS now in shambles and many of its assets compromised or in hiding, the remaining members of OAS hire an outside assassin to try and take out de Gaulle. The group meets with an enigmatic Englishman known only as \"The Jackal\" (Edward Fox) who takes the contract for $500,000 American Dollars. When the French government gets wind of this plot, they must try and stop The Jackal before he undertakes his assignment.The Day of the Jackal is an adaptation of the 1971 novel of the same name by Frederick Forsyth. A joint UK-French production, the movie directed by acclaimed filmmaker Fred Zinnerman was filmed on location in France, Britain, Italy, and Austira and feature filmed locations usually denied to filmmakers such as inside the actual French Ministry of Interior. The movie was a solid financial success including in the United States despite the lack of an American star (though not for want of trying as Universal had unsuccessfully tried to pressure the producers to cast Robert Redford or Jack Nicholson in the title role) and critical acclaim. The Day of the Jackal stands as one of the finest examples of European filmmaking with meticulous attention to detail that creates a compelling narrative.The movie when you break it down is pretty simple as far as plots go: OAS wants to assassinate de Gaulle, hires The Jackal, French intelligence tries to stop him. While the plot is simple and straightforward, it's the details in the filmmaking that keep us engaged. Throughout the film Edward Fox's Jackal will visit various characters, locales, and etc. And while seemingly without point the movie rewards your patience as these details come to be important and are pieces of a larger puzzle in how The Jackal will enact his plan. Edward Fox is chilling in the titular role as he goes from charming and charismatic to cold emotionless killer within moments with his face never once betraying an ounce of remorse or regret. The movie's heroes in the French and UK intelligence services are good and played by an assortment of solid actors from both France and England with the likes of Michael Lonsdale, Tony Britton, and Derek Jacobi just to name a few, but they never really get any standout character scenes like with The Jackal.The Day of the Jackal stands as a fine addition to Zinnerman's already impressive filmography and is a solid showcase for the talents of Edward Fox as the titular role. The movie keeps us engaged with its attention to detail with many moving parts that work together as a cohesive whole that creates a satisfying experience. While the heroes of the story are overshadowed by The Jackal, it's a relatively minor nitpick in a masterful exercise in suspense.",

After one unsuccessful attempt at taking De Gaulle's life, the team hire the Jackal who is prepared to do the job for $500,000. But with the French police soon hot on his tail, will the Jackal succeed?The Day Of The Jackal is an old-fashioned thriller which slowly, but rather admirably, builds its foundations. Once The Jackal is introduced, a good chunk of the film focusses on The Jackal getting all his ducks in a row in order to give himself the best possible chance of receiving his big money payment. Whilst this does slow the film down, it is never less than fascinating to watch The Jackal calmly going about his business (and believe me he doesn't let anyone stand in his way!!!).Once The Jackal has everything in place it is then just a case of him getting his timing right and getting to the right location at the right time. Of course, with both the French police and the Gendarmarie hot on his heels it is no easy task for The Jackal to keep crossing borders and having to continually show his papers (he has to use his ingenuity and initiative on several occasions to stay ahead of his pursuers).The cast are all on top form; Fox gives a very strong performance, but for me the most memorable performance for me came from Michael Lonsdale as commissioner Lebel (poor Michael Lonsdale looked as though he hadn't slept for a week for most of the film's running time). Whilst it could be argued that the film has a bit of a cheap-look to it that really doesn't matter when the product that is churned out here is of such high quality.In summary, The Day Of The Jackal is a first-rate thriller and one of the very best of its kind.",

Everything about this film is brilliantly original, and then the conclusion ends in such a pathetic cliche when the French president just happens to bend over at the same exact time Jackal takes his shot, allowing the French president to survive as his security service kills Jackal before Jackal can finish the job. It was such an abrupt and cheap ending and I felt utterly cheated after spending 140 minutes of my life watching one of the most bad-ass anti-hero assassin movies ever made. It made me irate that it ended this way, because it feels incredibly anti-climactic and utterly cheap when the entirety of the rest of the script was so nail-bitingly well written, especially when the film is centered around a ruthless anti-hero character but the anti-hero goes out like some wimpy milksop who somehow forgets to reload a rifle under pressure even though he's supposedly the best contract killer to ever live. He had no problems navigating France under the intense pressure of a martial law-style Nationwide manhunt, changing disguises and aliases and documents and killing others to keep his mission going, but then somehow can't handle the same pressure to reload a single bullet when it matters the most. It ultimately felt nonsensical because it was entirely out of character. The only way I tried to make this failure in writing feel coherent to the rest of the story was giving Jackal the excuse that he couldn't load his rifle because of the effects of the chemical he used to give himself his grayish sickly appearance when disguise d as an amputee veteran (earlier in the movie, his document forger claimed they used this chemical trick to a avoid duty but it would leave you sick and nauseous for an hour after, hence the placid appearance). But even then, I'm sure a masterclass contract killer responsible for the deaths of 4 world leaders behind enemy lines would be able to pull through a stomach ache to be able to reload his bolt action.It's an excellent film, just don't be surprised if you feel as cheated as I did in its final moments when the script seems to take a massive nosedive.7/10, loses 3 points for the ending that made me feel robbed",

            "content": "This stylish, British-French film, utilizes real-world elements, to launch this cool, fictionalization about an attempt to assassinate French President Charles de Gaulle in 1963. I'm sure you have heard of Charles de Gaulle. He goes back to WWII as a French army officer, who plays a pivotal role in France's liberation and eventual return, to aiding the Allies in the victory over Nazi-Germany. 13 years after the end of the war, he would become Prime Minister of France. The next year he would become President of France. He would resign in 1969, which was only four years before the release of this film. That is the cool thing about films like this. It is their proximity to the actual time that these moments fell on our real history. You need to remember that, when watching this film, from a 21st century perspective. The filmmakers' perspective is much more fresher than yours.A complex political situation had erupted over the years, since the war, between France and Algeria. It was so complex that even the French had internal civil battles going on too. By 1962, France was a mess and Algeria had won their independence from France. The only choice de Gaulle had was to grant them their independence and move on. This enraged a large segment of folks in France. A group known as the OVA decided to assassinate de Gaulle, but luckily it was a failed attempt, that happened in the late-summer of 1962.This is all the stuff that happened in the real-world, in a nutshell. It is all covered in the first ten minutes of this movie, but from there, we turn to the fictionalized story, that really makes this film entertaining and interesting. This is one of the most stylish, crime-thrillers, to come out of Europe in the 1970s. It is based on the best selling novel, of the same name, by Frederick Forsyth, about a professional assassin, who was hired to assassinate de Gaulle in 1963.I also like to mention, that it has similar story-telling techniques, reminiscent of Truffaut's Fahrenheit 451 (1966). It even has Cyril Cusack in the film, as the man who builds the weapon, that the Jackal (Edward Fox), needs for his assignment. Michael Lonsdale, who is the ex-Bond bad guy from Moonraker (1979), shows up as the very, stressed out Deputy Commissioner, Claude Lebel. This film has some tense action, methodical police investigation used for tracking the Jackal and I was surprised at how good some of the stunts were. There is some romance in the film, that helps strike the tones of dishonesty, without even saying it. This is a nicely, stylized film and a small piece of history as well.8.1 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",

I decided to rent it after I had seen the appalling The Jackal (1997) which tells the story as a tangled up completely gratuitous action movie.  The Day of the Jackal is none of those things.  In fact the way in which the story unfolds is so systematic that it is rather like a documentary.  We start with a brief background spoken in about 4 lines by a narrator.  Then we see various scenes which show the turmoil that existed in France at the time of 1960. This is followed by the scene in which the Jackal is hired to assassinate President Charles de Gaulle.  The Jackal himself is a fascinating character. Played by Edward Fox, he is not the clich\u00e9d silent, deadly type, instead he is boyishly charming, quick-witted and wonderfully arrogant - especially during the meeting with the OAS.  When going about his job, step by step, he is a dedicated professional and will do whatever it takes to get to the next step.  He can be very dangerous and if someone tries to outsmart him or take advantage of him, they meet a sudden, unexpected end.  Simultaneous to the progression of the Jackal, is the police investigative work.  The case is headed by a detective called Lebel, played with great modesty by Michel Lonsdale.  As the Jackal goes through various stages in preparing for the assassination, so too does Lebel and the audience are really allowed to become involved in the case as the police attempt to pin the Jackal down before it is too late.  This is a fascinating insight into the work of a detective and proves very exciting as the Jackal must always keep one step ahead of the police.  To sum up, despite being made 25 years ago, this is one of the most skillfully made movies I have ever seen.",

That makes sense since they all spoke English. Also the street scenes have pedestrians oggling at the cameras in the distance. The close up one's often look self conscious.I guess the movie was made in a period not that long after a time when orientals were portrayed by Caucasians with eye make up.

While visually on par with early 60s material, 'Jackal has an ace up its sleeve in the narrative department.  Some of the scenes try to use visual illustration to convey key plot points, but the cinematography is less than mediocre.This is a film about story and not about linking one content idea (i.e. set-piece action and sex scenes) together with another.  One thing I find hilarious is how the movie tells you everything you need to know in the first 20 minutes, then makes you forget all about it in the next two hours. To save yourself most of the trip, just fast forward to miss all the nagging subplots that aren't as lively as Ronin.  Since Fred Zinnemann isn't a visual auteur, I'll give him the reprieve I wouldn't grant to Luc Besson and Jean-Pierre Jeunet.While, in hindsight, this is a totally predictable outcome as are many films of the 70s like The Omen.  I am struck by Zinnemann's use of peace and subtlety, even when at times he is being all to obvious in both actions and force.  This isn't a great movie, but it has more strengths than such commercial trash as Mission: Impossible.Overall, you don't need to see this movie to understand the suspense/thriller genre, but it doesn't hurt as opposed to All the President's Men.

Maybe we could eventually point this out as a big mistake since the political background is made much too clear in the beginning, leaving not the slightest obscure force under wraps for us to chill. On the other hand we can't complain an American director can be that much careful about a 100% European story.On the uptake the Day of the Jackal starts out very well, provided you're not French and already know the whole thing about the Petit-Clamart assassination attempt. At some point the audience is rooting both for the uptight professional, the Jackal, and the French officer who relentlessly tries to hunt him down.Then, once the police starts getting precise information about the Jackal the suspense is rushed in an awkward way. The Jackal, charming yet cold as a snake until then, becomes less likable as he reminds us he is just a cold-blooded murderer. The increased pace of his road to Paris lacks the real elements of a chase. Yet the Police doesn't seem to get the upper hand, so we're let to wait for the events to unfold which is the other way to call an ill-conceived suspense.Basically I think we can analyze the unsuccessful part in this movie as adaptation traps. A killer in a book is a suspenseful device. Following a killer on screen would mean to empathize. Wrong way. But without the Jackal here we only get half a story, right? Maybe the solution is in not drawing the Jackal as a transparent man in the crowd, but more an evil superman like Fantomas or Mabuse. Well I may be wrong but this Edward Fox low profile but upper class character really left me dissatisfied in the end.",

Quite apart from the fact that Frederick Forsythe turns out rather good novels, among which this one is certainly a good read and I think one of his first, one of the most worthy features of this film is precisely how well the book has been adapted to the screen.The film quickly develops a firm tempo: the sequencing of scenes is gripping as the pace remains at a constant level, not too fast, just right, keeping the atmosphere tense from the opening to the closing scenes. It is, perhaps, one of the best films I have ever seen in this respect.Edward Fox as The Jackal is fine, unrepeatable; but even so Michael Lonsdale as the French Detective Lebel almost overshadows him: a truly superb interpretation, never overacted, beautifully controlled and balanced, wonderful characterization.Fred Zimmerman's direction is magnificent: he holds the line with the telling \u0096 taught, tense, each scene driving inexorably to the next, never a seond wasted nor cut: everything just spot on. He achieves what other directors in other films more or less classifiable as \"thrillers\" were not able to even approach in the perfection of timing and sense of rhythm. Good supporting cast, Delerue's music helps things along, and the photography is good. However, I can understand the fact that the unreality of everyone in France speaking English is highly unlikely. I think perhaps a little bilinguism might have added more reality; a little like in Soderbergh's `Traffic' (qv) which used English and Spanish side by side very effectively. I think it fair to say that cinema has changed greatly in the meantime.However, all in all, nearly thirty years later, `The Day of the Jackal' remains as one of the best films in this genre.",

There are several of these present in this film, yet it overcomes everyone of them, and is an outstanding presentation. (Of course, any Forsythe story helps a great deal.)First, there is no doubt as to the success (or rather \"lack of \") the \"Jackal\" will realize in his focal purpose, since we all know De Gaulle wasn't assassinated.Second, the film is very long, just under 2-1/2 hours, and many otherwise fine productions suffer from this extra length above the norm.And third, Edward Fox's lead character is a calm, deliberate, methodical killer - who murders unhesitatingly and with an eerie dispassion to permit moving towards the accomplishment of his mission. Yet, even without condoning this activity and purpose, and disdain for life on his part, we can't help but admire his smooth execution (an inevitable pun) of his necessary actions as the climax approaches. Any film/character who can achieve this is to be applauded for both strength of story, as well as the lead actor's performance.I saw this film recently, for the first time in several years, and the fact that it is now nearly 30 years since production, and more than 40 since the period depicted -- and knowing the precise turns of events in advance -- I enjoyed it just as thoroughly as when I first saw it.This is a true masterpiece -- both within its genre, and among films of its period, whatever the story or plot scenario.",

It takes a simple premise and slowly builds on it from many angles until finally the tension is released right near the end. Nothing is given away until the end. Nothing is obvious. The surprises just don't stop coming. Needless to say, I was at the edge of my seat, in true suspense, the entire time I watched it the first time, back in 1973, when it was released, but even today when I put the film on, I find that I have no trouble focusing and keeping my attention on the screen and the story.The acting is superb. The protagonist does an EXCELLENT job of building his character, and the supporting cast does a great job in putting the rest of the pieces together in a nice, neat package.I later read the book, which fills in some of the nuances that would be difficult to capture on film, but the film stands extremely well on its own, believe me, in telling the story. And it is true to the book in almost every way, something I really respect in movie making.If you haven't ever seen the movie, I would recommend going to the nearest movie rental store and either renting or buying it ASAP.My rating is 10 stars out of 10....I won't comment on the nineties remake except to say that it a feeble attempt at retelling the story.

            "content": "There's hardly any spare flesh on The Jackal. Ars est celare artem --- the art is to hide the artistry. This is a rattling good yarn, superbly told, no messing; and there's infinitely more art in it than in any of those flicks that scream ART at you. Suspense is not a matter of not knowing the outcome, but in watching the net tighten, and waiting to see just how close the Jackal can get to his target. The structure is V shaped: a very wide gap to start with, growing narrower by the hour, until the two tracks finally converge to a point: a bullet-point. The direction has a lot in common with Zinnemann's other masterpiece, High Noon, where, in effect, we are also assured of the outcome. In HN the ticking clocks are prominent, in DOTJ there are more of them, but they're not so obvious. In one film it's the good man against the rest; in the other it's the bad man against the rest. Where I come from, we root for the underdog, regardless. Why did the Jackal fail, and what was his tragic flaw? Ice-cold as he may have seemed, he got emotional. The key moment comes just after he's told his cover is blown. He can either pull away, and turn off back to Italy, when the roads fork, and wait for another day. Or he can carry on to Paris. He lets emotion get the upper hand, and carries on to Paris, which is not the sensible decision for a wise percentage player.\nAfter watching the action repeatedly, a number of blips in continuity become apparent, and several of these are noted elsewhere. There seem to be quite a number of cuts. Like, maybe he did kill Cusack after taking delivery of the custom-tailored gun. This would have eroded viewer sympathy too drastically and too early, whereas nobody gives a damn for the slimy, blackmailing photographer. How did the Jackal suddenly produce a spray-gun filled with blue paint? What happened to the barking Alsatian dog, after the car crash? Does it matter? Less is more, and explanations can be sacrificed for the sake of the pacing. Zinnemann has this great sense of what will work, what is necessary and what isn't, and how to be economical and cost-effective.",

Why is it that actors with English accents can convincingly play Frenchmen or Germans, of any era, while those with North American accents invariably sound totally out of place? In \"Jackal\" we even have a mixture of French characters with Gallic accents and others with English accents! The on-location filming adds a large degree of reality.

            "review_title": "The hunt for a professional or Intense confrontation",
            "content": "Thriller, detective. The film adaptation of the novel of the same name by the English writer Frederick Forsyth, which was released two years before the film adaptation and had a resounding success, and is still popular, although not as frenzied as in the early seventies. I have nothing to say about the original book source, because I have not read it, so I will evaluate the picture as an independent work, although I have information that the scriptwriters changed something for the film adaptation, and thank God that this was done. And I came across this picture quite by accident, being engaged in Yutab's activities, in particular, directed by Fred Zinnemann, who staged this picture. And here's my brief opinion - Intense confrontation. I practically did not notice any shortcomings in the picture, but there are some remarks that I will write in a separate paragraph, but for now, let me focus your attention on the obvious merits of this intense political thriller.So, here they are:\n1. Scenario - the picture is based on a real historical event that happened, namely the assassination attempt by members of the Secret Armed Organization (OAS) on French President Charles de Gaulle in the Paris suburb of Clamart on August 22, 1962 for his recognition of Algeria as an independent state and led to many problems. Well, after an unsuccessful assassination attempt, the remaining members of the organization flee France and understand that only a professional mercenary can kill de Gaulle. They find such a person, and soon the French special services will find out about this, and a deadly battle begins not only for the life of the president, but for the very future of the country. All the forces of the French special services are thrown into the capture of the killer known under the name \"Jackal\", but the Jackal did not get his reputation in vain. The whole picture rests on this confrontation, and the finale will definitely not leave you disappointed, because it logically follows from the events that happened before. And in general, it is always interesting to observe the confrontation between clever and cunning opponents, and this is exactly the case here.2. Characters - there is not a single checkpoint or frankly superfluous, including policemen and gendarmes, border guards and even other hotel guests. This is what the spelled characters mean, and not the cardboard boxes of the modern cinema, which is already tired of its monotony and predictability. On and about the main characters, I generally will not say anything.3. Choice of side - I was rushing about the whole picture, for whom to worry about, for the Jackal and the OAS, who were patriots of France, and most of whom President de Gaulle took away their homeland with one stroke of the pen (Evian agreements), since many members of the organization were Franco-Algerians ( ethnic French, born in Algeria). Or for General de Gaulle, whom I very much sympathize with for his struggle with Germany during the Second World War and the Great Patriotic War, for \"Fighting France\", for \"Normandy-Niemen\", for friendship and love for Russia, for a firm position in relation to star-striped, and indeed it is he who stands behind the foundations of modern France, for which he was overthrown, albeit not with their own hands, by the Americans in May 1968. I understand the motives of the OAS, but I am also not indifferent to de Gaulle, although he was also not an ideal leader, as evidenced by the Algerian events. But in the end he sided with de Gaulle, because of my respect for him. Indeed, in reality, the OAS turned from a patriotic organization into a gang of terrorists who ruined the lives of ordinary people in a tramp of rage from the fait accompli of their defeat.4. France of the early sixties - the country itself, its neighbors, society and life of that time are perfectly shown. The furnishings of houses, apartments, offices of high officials, and so on. There is even nothing to complain about here. Maybe I am not a historian in full measure with a diploma and dissertation, but my environment and life did not cause any complaints.5. Music - I can't say that this is an epic masterpiece of all times and peoples, but within the framework of the picture it sounds good. Special thanks for the \"March of Colonel Bogi\" and for the \"Marseillaise\" of course! After all, we have France after all!Now about the comments. The picture is boring because it shows the routine work of the special services - searching for names, filing cabinets, reconciliation, sleepless nights, and so on. This is a real routine that people have to face that work in them. This was not a problem for me, just be aware of the fact that the first half of the picture is more dynamic and exciting than the second, except for the ending of course. There are illogical moments associated with the disguise and actions of the Jackal, because there are such and no one will answer logical questions about them to the audience. And most importantly, the true identity of the Jackal has not been revealed. Yes, I know that this is also in the book, but there is an adaptation of the film, so the creators could come up with their own version.A little about the main characters:\n1. Jackal performed by Edward Fox is a professional assassin who agreed to kill French President Charles de Gaulle for a huge sum. Cold, cynical, emotionless, a real killing machine. A sly fox who manages to lead the best people of the French special services by the nose. It should be said that in this case, the emotionlessness of the actor only played into the hands of the script and the atmosphere, so Edward Fox did an excellent job in the role.2. Claude Lebel played by Michael Lonsdale - Police Commissioner, the best French detective, who is tasked with finding the elusive Jackal and thwarting the assassination attempt on the President. Acts skillfully and taking into account the experience accumulated over the years of service. And although he calculates the Jackal, this does not mean his immediate arrest. Michael did a great job.In 1997, a remake called \"The Jackal\" was released with Bruce Willis and Richard Gere, which only remotely takes a book and a picture as a basis, although I liked it as a child.As a result, we have a good political thriller based on real events, with an excellent script, good music, France of the early sixties, not without comments, and with excellent acting work.My rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",

This is like a camp version of \"The Man From UNCLE.\" Or \"Get Smart.\" Except it goes on way past two hours. And these guys are serious. I thought the French cops couldn't solve a bungling caper and they know who the \"Jackal\" is? It IS a good movie to talk back to, make jokes along the way, supply your own dialogue, fill in the blanks, balance your checkbook, call your lover, throw junk at the TV. But don't watch it all or you'll go crazy or die of boredom. In the end you won't know or care what happened whatsoever. I kept expecting President De Gaulle and his detail to turn and start firing on the production crew.The movie takes place in France, but it's one of those movies where just so you won't have to be bothered with actually reading subtitles, everyone miraculously speaks English. Some speak English with an English accent, some with a French accent. Just to confuse things a bit, the assassin the French rebels hire actually is English. Needless to say, this may confuse some viewers a little. The English are rude snobs as usual. As far as the actual content of the movie is concerned, there's not much to say. It was an uninteresting series of scenes strung together with no real passion or originality.Dullest thriller ever? Well, it's a strong contender that's for sure. I actually was expecting a pretty decent film but it just helped confirm by belief that Zinnemann's film for the most part is distant and lifeless. Granted I really like A Man For All Season. This film revolves around an assassin in 1963 and the job he's been hired for by the OAS. The job is to kill the president of France. For such an exciting sounding premise the film is a bore. It's directed in a disconnected manner that makes every detail of the film static. It jumps around as the assassin prepares for the job which consists of very little yet takes 2 and a half hours of film time. Meanwhile the police know the OAS has hired an assassin to take somebody out and are scrambling to find out how he is. Thing is the police just seem to magically come across information regarding the assassin's identity and where abouts, they do very little investigating and info just seems to fall into their laps.I found the movie dull, dull, dull. BUT, if you are a foreign film buff or a Political Drama fan, or gullible then this movie is possibly for you. I remember watching this as a kid and enjoying it. Also, the \"fancy pants\" English assassin character is just not believable. This film has not aged well.This 2-plus hour film was not a return on the time investment. Very dated, perhaps it was exciting or groundbreaking when it was released but today it just doesn't hold up. Some scenes drag on and on, while others (such as the ending) stop so abruptly you'd think no one went back to check the final cut. The assassin in the film is so unbelievable as a ruthless mastermind specialist killer it's hilarious. This thrill-less thriller ranks right down there with the other 1970's over-hyped \"thrillers\". Again, in their own time and context, perhaps these films worked. But today, not a chance.Don't get me wrong; I'm not big on car chases and exploding buildings and all that. But yes, I do want the story to MOVE ALONG. This story moves at a snail's pace... it PLODS along... I had high hopes for it, but about 2/3 the way through I snoozed, and was glad for the relief from this torturously slow movie. In case you didn't notice, the keyword is: SLOW. Worthless.",

            "content": "Everything that is great about this movie has been said, so I would just like to comment about what I thought was a (minor) flaw: the language. (Actually, one reviewer already brought this up, too, but just for emphasis...)  There were both French and English actors cast, but the language was English.  I think this film would have been greatly enhanced by the use of subtitles; have the French people speak French or English, whichever the occassion demanded.  It's just very strange to have actual French people speaking English amongst themselves and very, very British people cast as Frenchmen.  Very strange; almost silly.  Also, sort of silly was the fact that Derek Jacobi sounded to me to be effecting a French accent.  Whatever for?  None of the other British people even tried to appear French at all.The situation is different from that of, say, the film Papillon (incidentally of the same year as Day of the Jackal), which was targeted towards an American audience.  That film might also have been better served if the dialogue was in French, but then it might then not have featured Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman.  There was no real reason not to have French dialogue in Day of the Jackal, imo.However, this does not ruin the film and doesn't take away from it.  It only keeps a great well-paced, exciting thriller from being virtually perfect well-paced, exciting thriller.  They don't make thrillers like this anymore. Kind of a shame, but it also makes the film shine all the more.",

            "content": "France, 1963 and President Charles De Gaulle survives an assassination attempt by a terrorist underground movement known as the OAS.Three of its members are killed in the attempt while the others are arrested.Undeterred by this failure the group decide to try again but this time using a professional hitman - The Jackal, a young Englishman (Edward Fox), who demands and receives $500,000 for the job.After a lot of research coupled with false passport, ID cards & car licenses, Fox needs a certain kind of gun, so he gets in contact with a gunsmith (Cyril Cussack) who designs & builds a lightweight, build-it-yourself rifle.Satisfied that with both the weapon and the false papers, The Jackal prepares to track down and kill the President on Liberation Day.However, the French Secret Service are already on his tail after successfully interrogating one of the OAS members from the original assassination attempt. Will they kill the Jackal in time!?Based on the Frederick Forsyth bestseller, director Fred Zinnermann does a faithful reproduction for the big screen.  Zinnermann's last film was the 1966 classic, \"A Man For All Seasons\", so it was a welcome return to form after so many years away from the industry.In spite of the many flaws that littered the film, coupled with an over complicated storyline, Zinnerman keeps the film ticking over nicely with a good combination of thrills & spills but without letting it get too out of hand with all guns blazing.Instead Fred opts for a very low-key approach, introducing & identifying the main characters with a deft but detailed way. Fox, for example, is a typical English gent/playboy but with a methodical & calculating mind for detail. While his nemesis in the French Secret Service, Detective Inspector Label (Michal Lonsdale), is almost his equal for guile, patience & wisdom, as he tries to unravel the many twists & dead ends the Jackal leaves in his wake.However, there are moments when the film seems to crawl along before anything of interest happens, especially during the final 20 or so minutes.The dialogue also feels too complex & overburdened at times, and one wonders why The Jackal should want to choose something as important as Liberation Day to kill the President. Much as I admired Fox's business-like nature covering his tracks, it did bother me a great deal as to why he should choose such an obvious date when his own practical common sense would have told him that both the police and the Secret Service would be out in force to protect De Gaulle during such a major French celebration.These little quibbles aside Day Of The Jackal is one of the best political thrillers to come out of Hollywood. Unfortunately, however, Hollywood tried for a 1997 remake with Bruce Willis at the helm, The movie stank & bombed at the box office and was derided by fans & critics alike as a dreadful travesty and subsequently should be avoided at all costs.****/*****",

            "content": "I know most reviews are about how Edward Fox played the Jackal as an enigmatic assassin whose true identity was never known, he is buried at the end of the film in an unmarked grave and the person whose identity he stole earlier in the film is alive and well in London, but the best role among the supporting cast is that of Ronald Pickup as the Italian forger.Pickup, a classically trained actor who could play anyone from the Archbishop of Canterbury in The Crown to a character in Coronation St, really shone in his role as a forger who is entrusted with providing The Jackal with forged ID, driving documents and an altered appearance. The forger, whose name is never revealed, lives in a squalid apartment block in Genoa, which he finds ideal for his work as it makes him more anonymous. Also suggested in the film, he makes the bulk of his living from pornography, as his flat contains a photo processing lab and prints of naked womenA thoroughly dislikeable character who stands out in The Day Of The Jackal, the forger is a shifty, greedy and sleazy individual whose greasy hair, black shirt and flowery tie make him stand out, and his mention of trying to get out of military service comes as no surprise. Also his dingy and decrepit flat with its pornography makes him look even sleazier. Originally demanding \u00a3 300( about \u00a3 5000 in today's money) and the Jackal's original passport and driver's licence to carry out his work, the Jackal warns him that he wants the originals back and never to mention his work. However,on a second visit, the forger's greed takes over and he forgets that the Jackal is a highly trained killer with or without weapons and he demands another \u00a3 1000 for the Jackal's original passport and drivers licence. Suddenly the Jackal after tiring of the blackmail and the forger's sarcastic comments about dealing with an English gentlemen breaks his neck with a karate blow and dumps him in a casket.To me, these scenes and Pickup's role as a dubious criminal who is out of his league and is dispensed with by an unemotional Jackal are the best in the film. Obviously The Day Of The Jackal is a fantastic thriller, based partly on true events( there was an attempt on President De Gaulle's life in 1962 in real life by French Algerian refugees and their sympathisers), and it truly deserved its Oscar, but I think without Ronald Pickup, it would have been poorer.",

Fox just looked the other person straight in the eye and told them how it was. Michael Lonsdale from \"Moonraker\", gave a good performance as a good guy this time. Jean Tournier's cinematography is great and Ralph Kemplen's editing is superb. The Day of the Jackal is without a doubt better than the 1997 film \"The Jackal\" which had the same idea but the entire plot was different. My only problem with this is that it runs too long and has a few scenes in this film had no purpose what so ever. Why did Edward Fox get involved with a female? That was a waist of time and took down the pace of the movie. This is a good movie and worth your time. *** out of ****",

The film makes much us of telephoto lenses and zooms in a very similar manner to Munich. Hell, Spielberg even cast the lead detective from Jackal as \"Papa\". That said Spielberg's use of telephoto lenses and zooms works much better. He used them in a way that brings you closer to the action were Zinneman used it to keep you away.Something else that I found funny was that before watching it, I read Ebert's review.

The pace is excellent, and the film does a superb job of showing us the parallel intertwining threads of the Jackal and his pursuers as they spiral from tense perigee to baffled apogee. The Jackal's ingenuity in the times when he's close to capture is clever enough to make him a sympathetic character; while Lebel's brilliant detective work ensures that the audience's loyalties are with him too. With the viewer rooting for both sides, everybody wins, of course.But, oh! - what a ghastly creation is The Jackal himself. Fox plays it perfectly, because he is to the manor born. I'm sure Freddie Forsyth was delighted with Fox's portrayal of his upper-class assassin - Eton-educated, SAS-trained, ruthless efficiency with a touch of humanity that lasts only while practical. Tough enough to deal with the lower orders, but ready to snuff them out in a moment when they reveal their swindling natures. Tough enough even to take favours from a kindly bath-house poof when needs must (and to perform, presumably, the abominable acts the deception required, though of course we're spared the details of *that*), but able to cleanse himself by killing the man shortly thereafter.The Jackal's true proclivities are very hetero, of course - and among his own social stratum. We see him pluck a sophisticated aristocrat whose coolness crumbles before his charms. His couplings (naturally) impress her enough to shelter him from the hovering hunters. But this is not enough to guarantee his safety, so she too is snuffed out without a thought. Asking for it, she was.The demeanour of Fox's Jackal is most reminiscent of Rowntree, the sadistic prefect in Lindsay Anderson's If...., and it seems clear that his genesis would have been just those circumstances. He's an Establishment figure whose profession just happens to be murder - an anti-Bond, replacing courage with psychopathy, sexuality with oiliness, and cool with frigidity. I bet Forsyth wishes he could be like that.The Jackal's interaction with the gun-maker comes closest to a meeting of minds. It's an impressive scene, in which the cold professionalism of both parties is designed to awe us. \"Will the gentleman be moving?\" asks the machinist in his quiet way. Yes, the unnamed target is in reality just a head to be turned to a gory spray like a melon, but let's at least nod to the fact that he's a man, and even assume that he might be gentle. Ooh, how chilling.This is not an admirable person. There probably are real people like this, and they should be made into cat-food. There are certainly countless people who believe, hope or wish they were The Jackal. I suspect that Forsyth and Fox are among them, and that, really, is what's wrong with both.",

The French Police are soon on his trail and what follows is a superbly taut thriller as the killer stays one step ahead of his pursuers. The screenplay offers enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat, but without you getting lost. The film has been criticised for a lack of characterisation. Granted, but this is actually an advantage rather than a flaw as director Zinnemann never pauses the action to indulge in what would have almost certainly been dull moralising. Besides, very soon you actually find yourself actually on the side of the ruthless killer rather than the police! As superb as the cast is, the most credit must go to Zinnemann, who never lets up on the suspense and plot and brilliantly judges the entire film to keep your palms sweating and your heart in your month right up to the thrilling climax.

The technology, use of man power, attitudes about sex and culture, international affairs, policing strategies and more. This movie is like playing a 1970's tourist in a thriller movie. I've been to the Negresco in the 70's. My first camera was a 70's Fujica. Those Citroen autos are a blast. And to top it all off, the plot is tight and acting genuine. It sure was a male dominated world back then. How could anyone honestly admit they liked to smoke?",

Next time we see them, they are lovers.Sometimes they take out too much, and you miss out what is going on. The last few scenes for example, are a total let down, you are left scratching your head as to how they got there.Visually it's not so great, in parts it looks like somebody's old super 8 shots. Most of it has no soundtrack, which is actually nice.All in all a decent, if not great movie. There is much better out there.",

Consider the following.The Killer, was not thought to be French, so they say the British \"Do who have any assassins on the Loose ? \" to which they reply, yes, we suspect a Charles Calthrop of killing the Dom. Rep. President but have never bothered to investigate.His code name was a cryptic clue to his used name of Calthorp, how stupid was that.Applying for a British passport takes 6 to 8 week, he managed it in a day.There is no way of checking death certificates against Passport applications. This still the oldest trick in the book for assuming a new identity in the UK. However they managed it in a couple of hours.He managed to buy a forged driving licence and other documents, so why not a passport. How unlikely is it that you could pickpocket a passport of someone who bears a passing resemblance to you and use it as your own.The detective in charge was told he had all the power he wanted to conduct the investigation, however he never drafted in any extra personal except for one.The woman admitted to the detective that she slept with the Jackal (after lying first) ,  but was not planning on seeing him again. Why on earth didn't the detective have the house watched, just in case the Jackel turned up, which of course he did.Where did he get the paint from for the Car, this would have looked suspicious when presumably his car was checked coming over the border.He managed to do professional respray job of the car in an hour or so. Anyone having had a car re-sprayed knows this takes 3 days allowing for drying and several coats.When they Stole the woman's car, why leave it parked right outside the train station where it would be immediately found and indicate that he caught a train to Paris. Put it in a long stay car park you fool or somewhere out of view.When the train arrived in Paris, why didn't the detective ring the train station and have if met, instead for getting in his car as rushing across town himself, and of course arriving too late.A 70 years old Politician reveals state secrets to a 20 years old bit of crumpet Throws herself at him and keeps asking probing questions. I don't think so. Why did she have to get up in the middle of the night to replay the information from his phone. Obviously she would get caughtThe Gun he used looked like a pee-shoot.I could go on and on. A truly amateurish, dated  film, so bad even the Bruce Willis remake is more watchable.",

The scene where the jackal kills the forger is beautifully portrayed in the novel, whereas in the movie its a flop. The story as described in the novel has not been followed at many places.

Sure there are holes in the plot, there really aren't that many scripts that are totally immune to close scrutiny. I guess they should be but according to a view shared by many writers and directors once a reasonable level of realism has been reached it isn't terribly important to go all the way.In my opinion this film is light years ahead of the \"remake\" that can only boast about decent looking opening credits. DotJ is an interesting picture of France or at least Forsyths vision of it. Although based on real events the story is pure fiction and should be looked as such. As a plain thriller this is a good film once one sets the expectations on the level of reality rather low.",

When the Jackal dies, it's so boring and uneventful, you feel like killing yourself, or wishing that the Jackal had killed the French President, but nothing happens in the end, just like nothing happens in the rest of the movie, I would rather watch moss grow on the bark of trees than this travesty of a film.

            "content": "This picture (and the novel its based on) is knda sorta the true story of a professional assassin hired to whack Charles Degaulle in 1963. I say \"kinda sorta' because an assassination attempt did happen---just not in this exact manner.Curious thing that this movie has been around since I was 12 years old---but I had not seen it until now (over 30 years later)--Still, I was familiar with the basic bare bones of the story--I think that I read the Reader's Digest condensed version of the novel at some point. The film is an effective period piece from the 1970's about the 1960's. Wonderful Euro street scenes can be found throughout the movie. The whole thing moves along its course with a deliberately understated energy. This film reminded me for all of the world like an expanded, slightly more sophisticated British version of the old (seventies) American TV series \"Hawaii Five-O\"--I don't mean that as a put down--it is just that the pacing and observation of both the criminal and the police in parallel is quite alike. The performances of the actors are purposely shaded and in a sense secondary to the story---even the hired assassin (played marvelously by Edward Fox) remains a mystery. He is hired to kill De Gaulle for $500,000--with $250,000 upfront. This represents several million in 2004 dollars. His real motives for making the attempt to kill De Gaulle however seem rather more complex than just for the money. Consider that he still has an opportunity to bail out on the plot intact (and with a down payment safe in his Swiss bank account) after learning that the plot is discovered. Instead he continues on to Paris instead of returning to the safety of Italy. He continues on the mission even though his position becomes ever more precarious the closer he gets to his target. He must realize, of course, that his chances for success are small and that he may be hunted for the rest of his life--even if he manages to escape the scene. Still he moves on - propelled-it seems-more by a strange professionalism somehow bound into a type of conceit that doesn't allow for turning back. Almost suicidal in some respects.--",

            "content": "I saw this today for the first time in ten years, and it really impressed me all over again. This really has to be one of my favorites. Great performances by all, especially Fox and Lonsdale. Wonderful European locations.The pacing is right on; the beginning is deliberately paced, as a plan is meticulously put together. As the French authorities gradually piece it together (always one or two steps behind the Jackal), the tempo increases as it always seems either that Lebel is about to get his man, or that the Jackal is so far ahead of his pursuers that all is lost. When it's time for the assassination, you WILL be on the edge of your seat.I loved the way little seeds are planted early in the film that blossom later, like the medals that the Jackal buys at the bazaar. You might think he's just out antiquing while waiting for his gun and forged papers, but the medals turn out to be crucial to his plan. And the early scene where he surveys the vicinity of the upcoming Liberation Day proceedings is key - every detail that's established in that sequence comes into play later on. And then there's the wonderful subplot wherein the British focus on one Englishman, Charles Calthrop, who just >has< to be the Jackal. Accordingly, they center their entire investigation on him, and somehow it eventually leads Lebel to the Jackal. Then in a postscript, we find out that the English were wrong, and Calthrop was just some random guy who didn't have anything to do with anything.It's obvious that a lot of research and attention went into making this movie (and, I assume, the Frederick Forsythe novel it's based on). All the details seem right. The Jackal plans everything to a T, and it's all very credible; you never once ask, \"How in the world did he do that?\" Similarly, Lebel and his task force (and their English counterparts) break the case through endless grunt work and intelligent guessing, not ridiculous leaps of logic or absurd coincidences. Again, you never have to suspend disbelief to accept that they figured this or that out, because the dirty work they have to trudge through is right there on the screen.I should also add that Olga Georges-Picot has one of the most perfect bodies you'll ever see, and in one scene, you get to see a whole lot of it.In summary, \"The Day of the Jackal\" is a precision-crafted film that assumes that the viewer can think, can retain information that's more than 15 seconds old, and doesn't need to see a massive explosion or kung-fu battle every five minutes. Sadly, they don't make 'em like this very often anymore.",

We know virtually nothing about any of the characters except Lebel, and even then all we really know is that he likes Pigeons and sleeps heavily.When you've got something as beautifully taut as this, you don't need to care about the characters.One slight moan though.

What no one expects to see is a debonair, disciplined, and determined Edward Fox, The Jackal.Director Fred Zinneman (High Noon, From Here to Eternity, A man for all seasons, Julia) keeps the action tight and moving. I have to ask myself How did they he get the parade scenes? Realism and plausibility keep the movie together. You don't know what the Jackal is doing until 2 seconds after he does it, then the little light bulb does off: That is why he set up an apartment months in advance, or why he hooked up w/ a guy: to stay out of hotels.The actors on both side of the English channel are terrific to watch. I was cheering for the French and English Inspectors. They epitomized skilled, dedicated, seasoned investigators who did things very, very well despite the handicaps of having two govts watching their every move or leaking vital secrets. Two cheers for a young Derek Jacobi. YOu can see him later in Ken Branagh's Henry the V. He is one of the many fine actors in this film.All in all a wonderfully suspenseful movie. Once you watch this movie you get a good sense of comparison of how very little can be done to show a lot of action. No blood and guts but you know that people die. Compare this version to Bruce Willis' over the top, \"show the severed arm, show the tongues flicking in the air (when he plays tonsil hockey w/ his male lover), and glass starts flying when he unleashes his machine gun. Heck, The Jackal (Edward Fox) uses a gun made from a crutch and you know that someone's head will explode like a watermelon.Lots of class and suspense at a bargain price.Jerry Naradzay",

For instance, Michael Lonsdale as inspector Lebel fits his role perfectly, and so does Edward Fox as The Jackal. The plot lacks the usual holes which are common in many movie productions, due to the well thought-out and (I guess) researched novel and screenplay.Nothing in this movie is exaggerated, nor withheld, which makes it even more believable. It projects a credible image of how police work really is done, that there's a lot of basic out-in-the-street routine work that gets the job done, and not by blowing things up and/or engage in reckless car chases.
