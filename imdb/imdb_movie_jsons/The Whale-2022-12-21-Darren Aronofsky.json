  "An okay film with an incredible performance": "I think there are some good reasons to criticize this film. It's a fairly stage bound adaptation of a play. That's not always a bad thing. In many cases, staging a film very similarly to the way the play was staged accentuates what works about the play. I don't think it really does here, and the film's repetitive structures leads to some dead patches. There's also a powerfully melodramatic tone to this film that I'm frankly just a bit unsure of.I also think there are extremely bad reasons to criticize the film, and these reasons are starting to emerge as the consensus among critics in the mainstream media. This isn't a film about a very fat man. It's a film about someone with an extremely destructive eating addiction caused by grief and regret and the complete lack of self-worth that accompanies those feelings sometimes. There have been films that deal with drugs, alcohol, gambling and sex, but apparently when it comes to food, the only thing that this film can be doing is inviting you to gawk at the big fat guy. It's a very strange conclusion to reach that I speculate is generated by coming into the film dead set on the idea that this is all it can be doing.I did not come away from this film with any notion that I was supposed to see Frasier as anything less than a human being deserving of our deepest empathy. The film parades in some shocking imagery, especially up front, but I found that once I confronted it, my initial reaction subsided and I was seeing Frasier for who he was. I think it's an extraordinary double-standard that people can watch Nicolas Cage indulge in ridiculous and cartoonish bouts of binge drinking in \"Leaving Las Vegas\" and declare brilliance, but balk at Frasier's fits of VERY CLEARLY self-annihilating eating in this film and think we are only supposed to be processing it as some kind of freak show.I don't think this is an incredible film, and I wouldn't place it among Aronofsky's best. I do think Frasier's performance is brilliant, and the film is a flawed, but often marvelous character piece about a kind of addiction we seldom confront.",
  "A welcome Whale of a comeback for the beloved Brendan Fraser.": "Let me start by saying I've been a fan of Fraser since seeing Encino Man as a kid and this guy will always be one of my favorites. To see him somehow thrown out of Hollywood/not casted for the most part for the past decade was very frustrating for me. It was about time someone gave him another chance which Aronofsky and A24 did and it proved successful mainly because of Brendan's dedicated and emotional performance.The film itself is quite less pretentious and more honest than most of A24 films to date . It also has more of a down to earth straight forward delivery than most of Aronofsky's perplexing work. Honestly with the subject matter it needed to be and relies mostly on pure emotion and struggle which is shown masterfully by Fraser.There have been a lot of preconceived outraged overreactions and ridiculous assumptions based on the fact that Fraser is wearing a fat suit/getting prosthetics to appear as a morbidly obese person. I don't see why this is a problem mainly due to the fact this is a film made to entertain and to do so sometimes you wear things or makeup to alter looks. It would be difficult to cast a real life person off the street and have them pour their real emotions out on screen. I don't see that being easy.Also this is so much deeper than the looks of Fraser in the film and that's the true intention and power of this piece. People must see this raw and moving performance from Brendan and it's sure to cause a stir. This is the due Renaissance and comeback for Mr. Fraser. Oscar should be coming his way.",
  "Brendan Fraser gives a raw and chill-inducing performance": "Darren Aronofsky's \"The Whale\" is a deeply moving story about redemption, loss, and trauma. It revolves around a morbidly obese middle-aged man named Charlie who after losing his boyfriend goes into complete shock and denial and starts to gain weight uncontrollably. After his boyfriend tragically passed away, Charlie gives up hope and becomes a nihilist and rather pessimistic, as opposed to an eternal optimist in which he is remembered as. He uses food as a coping mechanism to suppress his deep-rooted feelings. This insatiable hunger lasts for eight years, until his rebellious daughter Ellie shows up. Charlie wants to reconnect with his estranged daughter, whereas his daughter feels differently. The title refers to Herman Melville's seminal novel \"Moby Dick\", which plays an important part in the narrative of the movie. In fact, it foreshadows the eventual climax of the film, which will tear audiences apart. The final minutes of the film completely wrecked me, thanks to Brendan Fraser's incredible performance and his instant chemistry with Sadie Sink. I wouldn't be surprised if the film garners Oscar nominations in the best actor and best supporting actress categories for Brendan Fraser and Sadie Sink respectively. Hong Chau is a knockout, as well.Final verdict: 8.5/10.",
  "greatness from Fraser": "Greetings again from the darkness. Brendan Fraser deserves an Oscar nomination. There's a sentence I never even imagined writing. If you recall (and you are excused if you don't), Mr. Fraser's early acting career is noted for such 'prestige' films as ENCINO MAN (1992), GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE (1997), DUDLEY DO-RIGHT (1999), and BEDAZZLED (2000). And yes, I'm being a bit unfair in the films I chose to name, as he has also had some solid performances along the way. However, nothing on his resume could have prepared us for what he delivers on screen in this latest from director Darren Aronofsky (BLACK SWAN, 2010).Award-winning playwright Samuel D Hunter adapted his own play for the big screen, and it's one that will surely drag you down and pound your emotions, even as it mesmerizes you. We first hear Charlie's (Fraser) soothing voice as he addresses the online college writing class he teaches. We see the students' faces on his laptop, but Charlie's square is blacked out. He explains the camera on his laptop is still \"broken\". Class ends and Charlie's friend Liz (a terrific Hong Chau, \"Watchmen\") shows up to read his blood pressure at 238/134. Charlie is a massive human being, barely mobile, and nearing death.Liz is also a nurse and tends to Charlie in a sense of loyalty and caring through their friendship ... the origin of which we learn later in the story. Thomas (Ty Simpkins, JURASSIC WORLD, 2015), who says he's a missionary from New Life Ministries, knocks on the door as Charlie is in medical distress. Liz treats Thomas as an intruder and demands he leave, while Charlie remains civil to him. Given his ticking clock, Charlie reaches out to his teenage daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink, \"Stranger Things\"). The two haven't seen each other in the years since Charlie left for a new lover. To say that Ellie has pent-up rage and anger directed at her long-lost dad would be understating the situation. She blows into his apartment like a tornado, spewing venom towards Charlie. They do come to an arrangement that entices her to return to visit while he agrees to assist with her delinquent school assignments.Almost the entirety of the story takes place in about 300 square feet of the upstairs apartment Charlie is confined to. The tight space adds tension to every interaction between the four characters, including Charlie's ex-wife Mary (Samantha Morton, IN AMERICA, one of my favorite forgotten gems from 20 years ago). Brendan Fraser uses his eyes to convey so many thoughts, even as we turn in disgust at his eating habits. An excellent score from Rob Simonsen and expert camera work from cinematographer Matthew Libatique complement the stunning performance from Fraser, and the numerous moments of intense tension and emotional turmoil. There are only a few times throughout where the live stage source material sticks out, and the ending is handled beautifully, allowing us a respite from the emotional rollercoaster of the past two hours.Now showing in theaters.",
  "Heartbreaking and eye opening": "There's a part of this movie that even before going in I was apprehensive about. Is it exploitative? More than probably, yes. Is it phobic in a certain way? It isn't impossible to think that. But being far removed from certain aspects of what the movie shows and yet being so close and feeling related to a lot of other things the movie portrays, I can only speak from what I got and felt about this movie.Performances by Brendon Fraser, Sadie Sink and Hong Chau were absolutely fantastic. But that's something almost everyone knew even before going in. What really touched me was the detailing through which they showed why each character behaves in certain ways and how everything ended up this way. The absolute helplessness of humans under a system and subsystems across various levels of power that are meant to make life better creates more obstacles for everyone involved are arguably the root of the evils here. But the way each person deals with the evils they face is entirely different even when those reactions have so much in common. That is really reflected in each of the performances. Each of them shows a variety of emotions that are so humane and makes your heart break even more with the contrast between their philosophies on life and how life treats them.For me, the film wanted to tell us that everyone is flawed, but it's the authenticity that should matter more than anything else which should be the road to happiness in life.",
  "Absolute gold...": "I got to screen this film for awards season purposes.It was very hard not to cry during several scenes.Branden Fraser is simply amazing. Under direction of Aronofsky it's probably the best dramatic film of the year.Fraser portrays the role to perfection. You feel sorrow for his character. The lady from Stranger Things that plays his daughter he is trying to reconnect with is going to be a huge star.There is nothing unlikable about this film. Fraser tugs at your heart strings with the struggles his character goes through.It's almost hard to watch at certain points in film; I had to take several breaks it's very emotional.Fraser is a very genuine guy in real life I have met him twice a decade apart and he was the same amazing guy.I hope this film does very well and ushers back a long awaited revival for Mr Fraser in Hollywood.Brilliant actor & film.10/10.",
  "Crushingly honest.": "Darren Aronofsky surprised me with this film as he kept the characters and their reactions to circumstances as the center of what's happening on screen.What was further surprising to me was the thorough nuance with which the film's sensitive themes are explored. Aronofsky is not a subtle filmmaker, but each of these characters is given such satisfying depth and is portrayed with their flawed perspectives and endearing desires on full display.The film has no hero or villain. Everyone is made out to be both to an extent and it's heart-wrenching to come to know these people throughout the film and watch them seek redemption.Some have criticised the screenplay as melodramatic-I didn't find this to be the case. I found it largely authentic, tragic, and full of intrigue that compounds as more information is revealed.My only glaring issue with the film is that one of the characters starts out as complex and with a singular nature, only to have that completely altered, oversimplified, and abandoned in his final scene. It seemed to me that this was done for the sake of the desired themes but at the expense of the character.But Brendan Fraser's performance alone marks this film as a colossal triumph, and there is much excellence to be seen throughout its entirety.",
  "Fraser will win Globes and Oscar--he's that good.": "See The Whale just to watch consummate actors, Branden Fraser and Sadie Sink, playing father and daughter, furiously catch up with each other after years of separation. Set in Charlie's apartment, just big enough for his morbidly huge body, The Whale is not only about the reconciliation of this odd couple and the survival of obese Charlie but rather about how obsession can consume faster than a greasy piece of pizza.Besides his abuse of food, Charlie refuses to let the Zoomed-in students see him in his rolling flesh. Yet, he is not self-centered or food-obsessed enough not to care about others, especially his flinty daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink, so much like a young Ellen Page), for whom he writes college essays (he teaches writing) and saves for her over $100K. His heart is as big, well, as his body.Writer Samuel D. Hunter (also author of the play) and director Darren Aronofsky move Charlie toward either reclamation or death; they remind us he did abandon normal life for a gay love, who eventually committed suicide, and over whom Charlie has not recovered. Good enough for Charlie to despair and abandon himself to food.Ellie's finishing high school is Charlie's other obsession, and whether or not they all can survive their confrontation is the abiding suspense. Pervading the drama is a sense of regret in almost every character except maybe the pizza delivery boy, Dan (Sathya Sridharan). Even Charlie's ex, Mary (excellent Samantha Morton), suffers the sorrows of their split family.Hong Chau, who has had a great year, if only for her role in Triangle of Sadness, plays the gritty Liz, a caretaker for Charlie and true friend, regretting Charlie's descent that allows no trips to the hospital and hides his money for his unstable daughter.The itinerant Jesus fan, Thomas (Ty Simpkins), is food for another essay but for now an effective emblem of the intricate characters supporting Charlie's journey. Herman Melville lends figurative richness to the proceedings. If I haven't convinced you of the gold in this small film about a big man, go see it to witness my prediction that Fraser will win Globes and Oscar.",
  "Brendan Fraser's Tour De Force": "While the title itself would be a pejorative for someone morbidly obese, it really ties into a story that the lead character Charlie holds dear to his failing heart. That is the story of \"Moby Dick\" Though the tale itself doesn't really come into play, if not for only the last great memory he has is of the sea and of a daughter that he had abandoned when he feel in love with someone of the same sex.Much has been said about Brendan Fraser's performance, and I couldn't agree more with the accolades he will get. As he is someone who is playing someone so uncomfortable in his skin, Fraser seems entirely wrapped up into the man's eat-to-death skin. And as someone who has had friends who are delusional when it comes to self-awareness of excess weight, the character of Charlie REALLY knows he is done with life. When he is reunited with his really estranged daughter, there is so much anger and resentment built up, you can feel the ugliness of family and the ability for them to destroy your insides. But Charlie doesn't take it to heart after all, he is the catalyst for the well earned disgust and hate. Hard to hammer on a guy who knows life has him beat. He is also doted on by his life partner's sister who seems to be both a caretaker and an enabler. She is played by Hong Chau, who brings so much connection to Charlie's lot in life. She both understands and has to standby as he self-destructs. This is very similar to the Elisabeth Shue character in \"Leaving Las Vegas\"This movie is not for everyone. People who have suffered abandonment and require easy answers isn't going to get it fully. There is no forgiveness for Charlie. Though he isn't exactly clamoring for it either. He wants to do the right thing, and tends to annoy people with his optimism despite his physical ailments. At a certain point one has to allow the person to go unto the inevitable end. Is this love? Not quite. Nor has he ever gotten it. But for a movie that relies on the past and history and family dynamics to guide the emotions involved here, a little background may have helped. Perhaps Charlie's own childhood would be a window into his self-destruction. Instead, the audience needs to piece together, perhaps, the backstory from scant clues.A one location drama is a remarkable feat we should all celebrate. \"Who's Afraid Of Virginia Wolf?\" blows any of them away. But director Darren Aronofsky does wonders with an isolated Idaho apartment. As if the outside world is as bleak as the one he is entombed in. The story of Charlie and his ultimate future is what should keep you watching. For others who require a lot of action, this is not for you. It is a quiet piece that Fraser absolutely nails through gestures and emotions. Some have criticized this movie for exploiting an obese person. At moments I felt the pity come through. But the wise decision was to make Charlie seem at peace with his decisions he's made, though still disappointed. What lifts him to the resolution we want comes from him coming to terms with his relationship with his daughter. But also, a incredibly uncomfortable moment with his ex-wife (nearly unrecognizable Samantha Morton) who has fallen into the bottle yet still holds warmth for Charlie.People aren't going to like how the world caters to Charlie. It could be uncomfortably funny as in \"The Simpsons\" where Homer gets morbidly obese to get to work from home. There is no motivation here for that. He is a recluse who enjoys the occasional visit and sometimes self-pity. And that will turn many people off.I wish there was a happier ending. But that's not what you go to an Aronofsky movie for. Not sure what this is trying to fully say. Perhaps...we make decisions in our lives that sometimes we can't repair, but the other person needs to know they tried? Maybe. It's a tricky line that isn't going to sit well with everyone. I happened to appreciate it. Maybe you will too.",
  "Started crying on Monday morning": "The film presents a week in the life of a severely obese English teacher named Charlie, from Monday to Friday. By late Monday morning I was already crying hot tears in my seat, while other, more daring viewers trudged through mid-week before giving in. Brendan Fraser's beautiful performance holds the film together and gives it all its power, in a role that I hope will bring him the recognition he deserves. All the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. It is a striking and thought-provoking film, so much so that days later I am still reminded of excerpts from the much-discussed thesis, the absolute protagonist in the film's final insane ten minutes.",
  "A solid 10 for Brendan Fraser! but THE WHALE gets a 6!": "Brendan Fraser should win every award possible for his role in THE WHALE. This would have been a very easy role to stereotype, yet Fraser made it complex, compelling, full of vulnerability and heart. This film succeeds because of Fraser's performance.Otherwise the film struggled.WHAT WORKED:\nTonally it worked. It had a dark, dramatic feel, the eating scenes were hard to watch, because you felt the pain of the character. The Production Design also worked well. The relationship between Charlie and Liz was the most believable, compelling, and grounded. I also didn't mind the aspect ratio, a bold and jarring choice at first, but you quickly realize it makes Charlie seem bigger in the frame, and this also works. Sound design worked well and the score (though at times a bit too dramatic) also served the film.WHAT DIDN'T WORK:\nBecause it was based on a play it was filmed much like a play. The blocking was really distracting, characters would get up and walk two steps then turn around, making human actions and purpose a bit unbelievable. There was overacting and overly dramatic performances especially from Ellie and Mary. Ellie was supposed to be a hurt and broken teen, yet it was played one note, with the same intensity from beginning to end. With the exception of Ellie's last line \"Daddy!\" the entire time she's on screen the actress portrays the same over the top actions, lacking in subtlety, nuance and emotional range. Even Samantha Morton who I consider to be a fantastic actress has some moments where it feels overacted/over the top and disingenuous, which makes me wonder if it was directed this way (as a play might have been on a stage). The writing was also at times a problem. It was hard to believe character motivations at times for why they would do certain things. The character of Thomas's want didnt' see earned or strong enough, the main purpose of his existence in the story was to give Ellie a \"person to save\" but the continued appearance of Thomas's character felt unearned and at times unbelievable, and when his true mission is revealed it's not some big altering reveal, more of a forced, and lack-luster one. Overall, some script/story decisions felt forced and convenient. Compared to Aronovsky's Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and Black Swan, The Whale is forgettable, lacking that \"je ne sais quoi\" that exists in Aronovsky's earlier works. But all of that aside, BRAVO to Branden Fraser who deserves to bask in every glory for his stellar performance as Charlie.",
  "Masterful, One of the best movies I've seen!": "I was immersed into this film from start to finish. Darren Aronofsky directed a spellbinding emotional triumph in cinema The Whale deserves numerous awards mainly for Branden Frazier! I love the essays, the engaging scenes, how honest everyone is, and heartwarming vibes. I don't have any complaints this is a perfect movie. I hope Branden is ok this movie had of been difficult to make. A tour de force view of an obesity and bonding that is continuously top notch acted. Every scene is worth watching mostly drama and some comedy mashed in well. I hope the movie gets high praise it very much deserves it all, highly recommend The Whale.",
  "Acting is phenomenal, but, story is somewhat flawed": "The Whale, is not Free Willy, but an overweight English instructor, who eats to cure his depression. His students have no idea, until a reveal of what he looks like. Chalie, played greatly by Mr Brendan Fraser, stays inside all the time, is embarrassed by his weight, and leaves cash in mailbox for food delivery.Charlie has no friends, but, a care taker who is his only friend, and brings in food and supplies. We find that Charlie is stubborn; he refuses to go to the hospital having high blood pressure, stating he has no health insurance. ( We learn latter he has around $120,000 saved for his daughter.) The care taker, Liz, we find out is a enabler; bringing double cheese meat ball sandwiches, and other treats.The Whale is based on a play, yet works better as a play. The film more or less has two sets, living room, and bedroom. The film is more or less seen through Charlie's viewpoint. The camera does not leave the doorstep of the apartment. It just felt there was more that could have been focused on had Charlie left home.I didn't hate this film, but, I guess I went in with bigger expectations. The acting is phenomenal, but the 2nd act tended to get reparative fairly quick. I do hope Mr Fraser wins the Oscar, but, as a movie, it is good, but I did not leave the auditorium feeling \" wowed..\"See it, but, I don't mean to come as harsh, but, it felt as if too much was edited out in final process as well.",
  "Drags after an hour": "This film started well but then began to drag and became more of the same. Brendan Fraser plays Charlie an obese English teacher who is heading for an early death . A loss in his life has led to him not caring about his weight . He sits on his couch eats and eats and teaches his class . He doesn't let his students see his face . Charlie's main visitor is his friend and carer Liz. (Hong Chau) She cares for him and wants to help him but Charlie refuses to go to hospital . He does want to make things right with his daughter \u00c3\u2030lie who dislikes him .The film is based on a play and you can tell . Most of the film is in one room and it drags . The standout of the film is rhe performance of Brendan Fraser .",
  "A Visceral Experience": "This was truly an experience. I went into this with very high expectations and I can truly say they were exceeded.The acting was impeccable. I honestly think Brendan's performance may be the best performance by any actor that I have witnessed. If that statement isn't true, I can assure you that he brought the most emotion out of me than any other actor. Sadie Sink was also phenomenal here. I was blown away. Hong Chau, who I somehow didn't know before this, was also out of this world.As always, Darren makes the whole thing gorgeous to watch-even when the scenes are filling you with dread, disgust, pity, sadness, etc. I feel like this film made me feel every emotion I've ever felt. I absolutely do not want to see it again anytime soon. I drove home in silence and before long I was sobbing.I went to see this film alone for more than one reason-but mainly because I wanted to allow myself to feel my emotions in full (aka I wanted to allow myself to cry my eyes out, which I did). I reserved a great seat in the middle so I had a couple to my left and a couple to my right. Both right next to me. When this film ended, none of us made a sound or moved for at least 5 full minutes. I was the first to get up and leave. I've never experienced that before.This film is not an easy watch but it's an important one. 10/10.",
  "The Whale is a wonderful surprise masterpiece!": "Brendan Fraser has proved he still has it. It's a beautiful performance that's long overdue for him. A film that will make you cry and love Brendan. A must see. He has long been a fan favorite actor but this Blast from the Past will make you rethink his acting. A brilliant film that is a sneaky great film. If you are on the fence about seeing this you'll regret not seeing it. I felt a sense of sadness and love when watching this film and I cried many times. It's not a film that comes around 9ften but when it does it changes cinema. An Oscar contender film with real heart. The best film of 2022.",
  "Who wrote a story about my life without my permission???": "I just got back from seeing this movie in theaters. I'm not sure what to say yet because I'm still feeling and processing everything I just watched. All I can say is the performances in this film were incredible all around. I was crying throughout the majority of the film because so much of what was depicted and described in the movie paralleled so many things that I have experienced in my own life. I only wish my dad could have seen this movie before he passed away last year, and that maybe we could have talked about it if we had been in touch the last couple of years. This movie probably will not affect everyone the same way but it definitely had an impact on me. I've never seen anything like this before. Ever.",
  "Don't judge a book by it's cover...": "I'm not an emotional person per se, but I tried really hard to keep myself together, but Brendan Fraser nearly makes this impossible in the last 10mins of this movie! Having writer Samuel D. Hunter at the screening made this even more emotional and touching and he so deserves an adapted screenplay Oscar for this.@TheAcademy: This is an incredible year with incredible movies and performances. I think NOW it's the perfect time to make a one in a lifetime exception and give an Oscar to Austin Butler AND Brendan Fraser - they both deserve this by such gripping and well played performances...but I digress, You want to hear about the movie....Sometimes a movie comes out at the write time and post all the C19 isolation, this movie might actually hit more people than it would have done before, and that is a good thing!This movie is written in such a beautiful manner that it instantly should become a classic of our times. The even more beautiful part here is, that it also relates to a classic, by referencing Moby Dick a lot and this makes you (re-)think and put it all into perspective.You like Max in Stranger things? Excellent, Sadie Sink does such a good job that you can't feel anything but despite and hate for her character. Hong Chau also does great work and delivers probably the best performance of her career here, I would love to see her rewarded for this with at least a nomination.This movie will take you onto a boat, sometimes the waves will hit it hard and it gets rocky, sometimes the quietness of the sea let's you reflect on the bigger picture. Just remember...Don't judge a book by it's cover, or it's descriptions of whales.",
  "breathtaking": "I looooved this movie. It is clearly based on a play, and if you can accept that from the start and just take it all in, this movie really takes you into emotional spaces i didn't expect.At some parts I admittedly laughed when I shouldn't but when the film reaches culmination it's impossible to not be taken by the beautiful agony of this tale.This will win a best lead Oscar and bc Aranofsky used so much restraint I suspect he will be snubbed but as with all his films I guarantee you wont be able to shake this movie off.This is legit art and it will make you uncomfortable, but unlike Mother -- it will be totally justified in the end.",
  "I wanted more out of this movie.": "I want to think maybe high expectations hurt my perception of this movie, but honestly I don't know if I would've liked it anymore had I known nothing about it.I think that it had so much potential, but fell flat with the storyline. His daughter who he hasn't seen in 9 years he reaches out to because he thinks he is dying and when she arrives it is kind of like she hadn't seen him for a week. I know her character was supposed to be unlikeable but her character had really no depth, just hateful and mean. They could've added more to her understandably let down and abandoned personality. That's kind of how I felt about everything though. Maybe had there been flashbacks of Brendan's character younger with his partner, delving into their relationship more or his struggle with mental health or the period when he chose to leave his family....there wasn't enough depth to any of that. No connection to his partner and what lead him to what he became. I wanted to connect more with this story, I wanted to feel more his past that lead him to his miserable future.I'm also not saying Brendan's performance wasn't good, but I'm not sure I felt it was Oscar worthy. I don't know, I wanted to cry, I wanted to feel it, I wanted the \"life is so short and what you make of it feeling\" before heading into this New Year, but it just wasn't there for me. And I was bummed.",
  "This film left me speechless.": "Beautifully crafted, vulnerable, yet gripping. Extremely visceral from the get-go, starting with a memorable (and uncomfortable) first scene. It doesn't lose its grip on you until the touching, heart-wrenching end. The camera is very opinionated in showing you a POV and it's based on the screenwriter's own experience struggling to connect with a younger person whilst self-medicating through food. Critics please note - it's not a film about fat people or being fat. At it's heart, it's themes are quite deep - redemption, self loathing, emotional honesty, judgement from others and the struggle to find real connection. Incredible and challenging performances, especially from Brendan and Sadie.",
  "Daddy please...": "I had high expectations for this film and whilst the acting was outstanding from everyone involved, I couldn't understand nor relate to the plot.I understand grief and I know how easy it is to spiral should you not know how to pick yourself up quick enough. That part is truly sad.However, I'm struggling to grasp why an intelligent professor with such kindness & compassion would want such awful people in his life (eg. His daughter); people who would repeatedly and intentionally shatter his self esteem and hope? Even the only kind character (nurse) in the film enabled him by continuing to bring him the exact thing that was killing him while remaining upset with him for his choices?Also, if you were that bothered about about your kid growing up to be a caring person, surely you would use the money to get a gastric band and continue to be her father? At least then he might have had an opportunity to rub his good soul off on her. He might then have felt like he had a reason to live and be healthy....kind of a cop out if you ask me.",
  "Fraser shines in a complex career-high turn.": "THE WHALE (2022) ***1/2 Brendan Fraser, Sadie Sinks, Ty Simpkins, Hong Chau, Samantha Morton. Fraser gives a career high performance of depth and heartbreak as an obese man attempting redemption in rekindling his relationship with his estranged teenage daughter (Sinks all seething contempt) before his health completely betrays him. Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky's adaptation of Samuel D. Hunter's play plumbs the depths of humanity and allows his star to shine buried under a mountain of prosthetics by Adrien Morot in a tightrope act of what could've been a disdainful freak show or worse a melodramatic mess.",
  "The Man In The Fat Suit": "This new film, the story of a morbidly obese teacher eating himself to death while grieving the death of his gay lover and attempting to reconnect with his daughter, walks an interesting line between, on the one hand, ticking all the boxes of the modern identity politics checklist - gay lovers, diverse casting, perpetually-angry women and Christianity-bashing - while also delivering the most crushing blow to the body positivity movement that has perhaps ever been put onscreen: the feeling of horror and revulsion that Brendan Fraser in his fat suit manages to evoke in the viewer is quite a wonder: he really does look like a whale whenever he struggles to his feet, and his complete inability to meaningfully function in the world, or even in his terminally collapsing body, is kept front and center the whole film, never shied away from or sanitized.The three female roles are well-acted (Hong Chau, especially) but the characters they play are pretty unpleasant and hostile, and the daughter in particular is thoroughly despicable, which the script never really addresses in a serious-enough way. Meanwhile the men are all weak and pathetic and relentlessly apologetic. It's hard to say what the point of it all is, other than to spend two hours in the company of no-one you'd want to know, but it does hold the attention for the most part and Fraser makes of his role something quite memorable.There's no great twist to the story, and it never escapes the feeling of being just a well-shot play, almost entirely set in the same room, with people continually getting up to leave and then deciding to stay a little too often. Much of the script is lazy, with weak characterizations for everyone, and it falls quite some way short of adding up to anything meaningful enough to truly justify the time out of our lives we give it. But it's still a cut above most things at the cinema these days and one of Aronofsky's better films.",
  "A mean version of The Wrestler (2008)": "I had an incredibly hard time knowing what to write for this movie, but after giving it some long and hard thought, I'm torn. Brendan Fraser gives a career best performance and hits all the right notes, as does the rest of the cast. The issue for me was how the material was handled. I heard so many critics saying how \"kind\" and \"empathetic\" this movie was and how it was Aronofsky's first movie since The Wrestler to accomplish such a thing. The only thing I can say is that this movie is basically a carbon copy of The Wrestler, right down to the ending, but it was anything but empathetic and kind. Unfortunately, one of my biggest complaints of this movie was how mean spirited it was. The only kindness we really get is from Fraser's Charlie. Even Simpkin's ever sweet character succumbs to cruelty. I also understand that the filmmakers want so bad to show food as an addiction, but it got way too over the top. The whole movie, even down to the title, feels more or less like a sideshow attraction to Fraser's character. Plain and simple, it's as much a dramatic character story as it is a deeply cynical body horror film. I'm disappointed.C.",
  "\"The saddest movie I've ever seen\" -my girlfriend": "Another masterpiece from perhaps the truest modern master of bleak cinema. A smart curveball after the world's response to Aronofsky's last masterwork, Mother! - I have never witnessed another film so passionately hated on in my entire lifetime. While The Whale and Mother are about equally bleak, The Whale sits almost entirely in the realm of realism while Mother was the polar opposite - pure surrealism, which clearly the average person cannot seem to find the value in. Out of all of Aronofsky's films, this one is definitely most comparable to The Wrestler - it comes as no surprise that The Wrestler was his most successful film, as it was the \"easiest to watch\" and was his only other film that featured almost no surrealism. The Whale is definitely a heavier viewing than The Wrestler as it features almost no moments of relief, fun, or positive vibes - it starts heavy, and consistently gets heavier as it progresses, so you have to feel \"up to it\" before you start this anvil of an experience. I feel blessed to have family who I can go to something like this with on Christmas Eve and have everyone be okay with it.Yes, I would be happy if Brendan Fraser wins an Oscar for this. When the film first starts, you kind of feel like you're in for this weird novelty thing, but within 10 or so minutes, you're in Charlie's house - that's not Brendan anymore, it's Charlie. The whole cast does a really great job, even Sadie Sink who's character is very one-dimensional, but she's supposed to be. She is a representation of a teen so damaged and so estranged that forgiveness and softness is impossible, only pure angst remains.My girlfriend calls this \"the saddest movie she's ever seen\", and though I didn't have that thought personally I would never argue against it. I really think that people who hate on Aronofsky films are mostly just people who are either uncomfortable with getting into a deeply emotional state or are uncomfortable with legitimate darkness as a whole. I see people talking smack about the ending in some of these reviews but the ending is what really got me. When I really started bawling was when the credits hit, when the whole cohesive experience came smashing into me like a sledgehammer with a nice Christmas bow on top of it.Everything is just really immaculate here, specifically the writing, directing, acting from the entire cast, and the overall structuring of the entire experience. It's not exactly an ENJOYABLE experience, but it is a crushingly powerful film, and in my opinion its flawless.(FYI, I consider Requiem For A Dream, Black Swan, The Wrestler, Mother, and The Whale to be Aronofsky's masterpieces, while I'm also a big fan of The Fountain - it's got my favorite music composition of all time in its finale!)",
  "This movie broke me.": "SCORE: 10/10I needed to go to bed and regain my energy level before writing a review about this movie I saw last night. By far the most emotionally draining thing I have ever watched. But, before I get into the review of the movie, let me start by saying one thing. DO NOT listen to those idiots on Tik Tok or reviews warning Christians not to see this movie. Those people are the exact type of people this film is calling out and, as a strong Christian myself, I commend them for doing it. They are the ones that give us a bad name. Christianity is a faith, not a people, and it is humans that use their own free will to do messed up things that tarnish its reputation. Their actions do not speak for what all of us believe. Okay, now for the actual movie.In my opinion, this was the movie of the year and one of the best movies I have ever seen. I was someone who loved Elvis more than others and thought Austin Butler was a lock for Best Actor, but this completely changed my mind. I was extremely skeptical when I kept hearing people crown Brendan Fraser as Best Actor in his first film back, but there was something different about his performance and the movie in general. A lot of absolutely amazing movies came out in 2022 and there was no way that I thought this one had a chance of competing or that there was any possible way 2022 could bless us with an almost perfect movie. I was wrong. Most of what makes this movie so amazing is how simple and human it is. The entire movie takes place in one location, Charlie's apartment, and adds to the beauty of the acting performances and how they were able to make something so awesome. Sadie Sink was the perfect casting for his daughter and I enjoyed what both Ty Simpkins and Hong Chau added to the movie.I could honestly speak forever about this film, but it was really all about human struggle, which I know didn't sit well with a lot of people. It was so hard for everyone to sit in the theater and watch Charlie get treated the way he did and constantly see the struggles of all the characters. His line when he exclaims \"I just want to do one good thing with my life\" was the moment that broke me. It gave me \"it's not your fault\" vibes from Good Will Hunting. The movie starts with us meeting Charlie in a very uncomfortable way, but as it goes on we really get to learn more about his personality, mainly his optimism towards people. The plot was definitely more on the dark side, which made the humorous scenes that much better. Ellie's interactions with both her father and Thomas allowed the audience to take a little break from the awfulness of the story and have a genuine good laugh. Time after time we see the characters blame each other, with it getting nastier as the film goes on, but each relationship almost ends in the same way. After shouting, cursing, and belittling the other person, a real, human moment occurs where you see the two people connect again. It's a magical moment where you realize that all the yelling and screaming is coming from a place of care and love so strong that it's not until popping off that they realize what they really value, which is each other and having a relationship. Remember, forgiving someone does not equate to giving them another chance, but is necessary when someone is truly, genuinely sorry.Honestly, the story was just too top tier for me to be solely focused on the lessons I learned, which is unbelievable. I found myself just so emotionally drained for the fictional story that was created and, when I say there wasn't a single person walking out of the theater without crying, I'm not lying. It is also probably the only movie that made me start crying in my car when I thought about it after it was over. I think the most important things to take away from the movie is that people you love will make mistakes, there is always a deeper reason why people do the things that they do, and the more compassion and empathy we show towards other the better. It also, as most powerful movies do, shows the importance of communication and being truthful with how you feel. The ending, although absolutely heartbreaking, was beautiful in the way that it encourages all of us to stop subscribing to the BS way of life that everyone tries to sell you and live authentically. Never give up on those you love and always lend a helping hand to those in need. My gosh was it so painful to watch Charlie go through what he went through, but it's even 1000x more painful to know how realistic it truly is.",
  "The Performance of the year Bravo ! Brendan": "My Review- The WhaleMy Rating 10/10If there is any honesty or integrity left in the members of The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences Brendan Fraser will win the Best Actor Oscar for 2023.His performance as Charlie a morbidly obese gay English teacher who has been eating himself to death since Alan his lover took his life is emotional and fascinating.The story of The Whale has many aspects as it commences with Charlie hiding his hideous appearance off screen from his students while asking them for honesty.The movie is about so many things all at once writing, parenting, teaching, religion, body image, over-eating and the price paid by gay couples who face family rejection and guilt , especially when right wing evangelical religious zealots spread their prejudices and hate speech.It is a shock at first to see such obesity but the incredible intelligence and sensitivity that Brendan Fraser brings to this character I found one of the most impressive and moving performances I've seen from any actor in my recent memory.As Charlie tries to reconcile with his estranged daughter Ellie before it's to late we see his humour, honesty and sadness on display his great character soon makes his grotesque appearance redundant.Sadie Sink is wonderful as Ellie a broken soul much more like her father than she imagines .Ty Simpkins is the fourth part of this quartet of great talent he plays Thomas a young member of an evangelical religious group who knocks on Charlie's door and sees it as a sign that he must spread the message to this sick obese man who he sees as a sinner needing saving .I've admired Brendan Fraser for years since his superb performance as Clayton Boone in Gods and Monsters in 1998 but some of his roles since then have not lived up to his great promise.It's not surprising to me that Brendan Fraser received a six minute standing ovation at The Venice Film Festival.Hong Chau who plays Liz Charlie's nurse and the sister of his deceased lover also gives a superb performance and thoroughly deserves her Best Supporting Actress nomination .The Whale based on the 2013 play by Samuel D. Hunter who also wrote the screenplay should also be nominated for this years Best Picture ,Best Screenplay and Best Director Darren Aronofsky and the very effective but unobtrusive score by Rob Simonsen should also be nominated in my opinion.It's unfathomable to me that this movie has only three nominations Best Actor ,Best Supporting Actress and Best Achievement in Makeup and Hairstyling.It's an intimate and honest movie I read that the reason it was shot in the 4.3 frame aspect was so the audience can't ignore the amount of space Charlie takes up in the world as he never leaves the apartment over the course of the movie.The other thing audiences can't possibly ignore is Brendan Fraser's finest screen performance.",
  "It Broke My Heart in the Best Way": "Whether you're talking about George of the Jungle, The Mummy, or even Airheads, Brendan Fraser has always been a likeable on-screen talent. Due to many personal things throughout his life, he hasn't been around much, but I'm very happy he is making a strong return to acting. The Whale is his latest release and while I wouldn't exactly say the film itself is incredible, his performance is and it's actually so good that it almost made me just say, \"screw it, this is the best film of the year.\" I didn't quite get there after thinking about it, but here's why this film is more than worth seeing for the performance alone.Being severely obese after a lifetime of wrong choices and hardships, Charlie (Brendan Fraser) is in his final days and trying to continue his job as an online English teacher. The premise of this film aside from that is the fact that he hasn't seen his daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink) in many years and would like to reconnect with her. Ellie is a troubled teenager and wants nothing to do with her father, as he abandoned her and her mother. The reasoning behind that had me in tears by the end of the film, but I won't ruin that here. The relationship between the two of them is absolutely heartbreaking, but it worked really well.It was nice to see Ty Simpkins return to acting here as well and Hong Chau as Liz was great too. Her back and forth with Fraser was very enjoyable. Why you should see this film though is Brendan Fraser, period. It sounds cliche to say that he transformed himself and he deserves an Oscar, but all of that chatter out of festivals this year is all true. His performance here is unlike anything he has ever done. My eyes couldn't leave the screen due to his performance. I found The Whale slightly slow, but the film also flew past because I was loving him in this film so much. Darren Aronofsky directed a career-best performance out of Fraser and it's why I loved watching this movie overall.The Whale doesn't suffer from being strictly about this man in his apartment, but those issues fade away due to this powerhouse lead. The camerawork by Matthew Libatique, although simple, was also stellar. The choice of aspect ratio also made it feel like you were confined in this apartment with Charlie. Look, this isn't a perfect film and I think the ending is abrupt, but it moved me. It broke my heart into a million pieces in the best way. If you're looking for a heartbreaking drama, look no further than The Whale. Now playing in theatres.",
  "Subplots Ruin 'The Whale'": "It is rare that subplots alone severely impact the quality of a story, but such is the case in The Whale.I'll start by saying that the performances in The Whale are superb (especially Brendan Fraser), as is the direction. The fact that they can make an engaging film set in a single location is awe-inspiring.The main plot focuses on a morbidly obese man named Charlie that is dying (no spoiler yet!). This central plot is well crafted and executed. It would be nice if Charlie explains why he will not seek help (even if it's a lie), but the writer leaves that part up to the audience, which is his prerogative.Then we come to the subplots. Here is where things begin to go downhill.All the subplots in this film involve people coming into Charlie's life, constantly knocking on his unlocked door because he cannot leave his house due to his obesity. In the first scene, Charlie is visited by Thomas, a young man that says he is part of the New Life Church. It is never said what denomination New Life Church is (if any), but Thomas carries a Bible that he quotes. Thomas is a typical Bible-thumper, fanatical and holier than thou. He is judgmental and chastises Charlie for being gay. Being a bigoted, judgmental hypocrite is terrible, no matter what religion a person claims to represent. However, from a story perspective, this is a trope that has been overused. It's lazy writing at this point, with no fresh take. And a white Christian or Catholic male is always the evil hypocrite. Why not have someone affiliated with a different religion represent this character? After all, every religion/cult has them. The answer is simple: it's too risky and not PC.This subplot gets thin when it is revealed that Thomas is a former pothead who stole money from the church and ran away from home. His motivation and backstory suddenly become muddled, as it is unclear why he did anything up to this point. Perhaps it is an ill-fated attempt to show his hypocrisy. Again, lazy writing.Then there is Charlie's daughter, Ellie, one of the most annoying/evil teenagers to be put on film. But, having a heart of gold, Charlie never loses faith in her very well-hidden good nature. I understand she is a hormonal teenager (a bit of clich\u00c3\u00a9) whom her father abandoned, but Ellie is over the top. She nearly kills Charlie by spiking his food with sleeping pills. Ellie also takes pictures of Thomas smoking pot and secretly records a conversation in which he admits he ran away from his family and old mission in Iowa after stealing all the money from the youth group. Ellie then sends Thomas's confession to his former youth group and family. In a reversal of expectation, his family dismisses the incident and welcomes Thomas home. But it is very unclear why Ellie sent the confession. Was it to out Thomas or to save him? Yes, in the end, Ellie shows a little compassion. But it is too little too late. Her sudden change seems forced.Then there is Liz, the sister of Charlie's deceased partner. This subplot is in a grey area at best. Despite Liz's good intentions, she is not a very good nurse. She gives Charlie junk food and, despite knowing that Charlie is dying from the very beginning of the film, does not call a doctor or get more help. If you know someone is eating themselves to death, wouldn't you feel responsible for getting this person professional help even if they do not want it? Liz and Charlie's interactions are not 'protected' like that of a psychiatrist with a patient or a lawyer with a client.Then there is Dan the Pizza Man. Why is this guy in the film? Just to remind the audience one last time that Charlie is fat and repulsive by giving him a judgmental stare before running away?The best subplot is the ex-wife.",
  "The Whale Makes a Big Splash": "Was lucky enough to see this film three months ahead of its official release date and I'm literally AMAZED. I've been dying to see this movie for a long time now. Im a big time fan of Darren Aronofsky and an even bigger fan of Brendan Fraser. This movie is so beautifully tragic and extremely moving. The performances are also perfect. Sadie Sink is masterful and Samantha Morton makes the most of her brief screen time. However, the real obvious standout is Brendan Fraser. He delivers a truly stunning performance as \"Charlie\". He is in full control of every scene that he is in and it's beyond powerful. He deserves the Oscar for best actor and there is no doubt about that. See this movie when it comes out. It'll make you sob 20 times but it's easily one of the best movies to come out of 2022.",
  "3-act play on film": "I saw \"The Whale\" yesterday starring Brendan Fraser as a morbidly obese man who is eating himself to death after the untimely death of his lover. It is directed by Darren Aronofsky from a play written by Samuel D. Hunter. So, the movie itself is a 3-act play filmed in Fraser's characters Idaho apartment. His only visitors are his nurse, his embittered daughter, a religious missionary boy hoping to convert him, his ex-wife, and his pizza delivery man who has come to know him by name. Fraser is buried under a fat suit simulating a 600-pound man. Many have praised Fraser's performance, and it is very good, but I don't think it is Oscar worthy. Working under heavy makeup is not an automatic Oscar nod IMHO. I was actually more impressed with the supporting players' performances, especially Sadie Sink as his daughter and Hong Chau as his long suffering but devoted nurse. I cannot give the movie my highest rating, but it is still recommended for fans of a well-acted drama in a confined setting. 7/10.",
  "Certain feelings at once": "Imagine that there was complete silence in the hall for 2 minutes after the end of the movie (The Whale). You don't come across something like that very often. Brendan Frazer, directed by Darren Aronofsky, gave an incredible, amazing performance. When you watching this movie, you felt certain feelings at once. Such films don't happen often, but when they do, they change the cinema for the better. This psychological drama about guilt, loss, and trauma is one of the best films of this year. I hope it wins all the awards it will be nominated for, most importantly in the best actor category ( Brendan Frazer). He will probably win.",
  "Guilt, Grief, and Grace": "I liked this movie a lot more than I thought I was going to. It's a compelling story splendidly acted by a dynamite cast. The major problem with it is that it is based on a play, which was obviously one of those modern box-set, small cast affairs. It still has the claustrophobic feel of being shut up and isolated from the outside world. However, that may be a directorial choice to emphasize the central character's dilemma: he is so morbidly obese that his body has become his prison. The ending also has the feel of a stage play where everything is neatly tied up and explained. The theatre is about language; movies are the visuals. But nonetheless, the film is quite moving in many places, thanks primarily to the fine actors. Brendan Fraser as the central character, an obese English professor who teaches an on-line class in effective writing, and Hong Chau as his caregiver have both earned well-deserved Oscar nominations. It's a pity that there could not also be nominations for Samantha Morton as Fraser's bitter ex-wife, Sadie Sink as his bitter estranged daughter, and Ty Simpkins as a sweet religious fanatic, as they are all splendid. The most \"shocking\" scene is right at the beginning of the movie when we see the disgustingly obese Fraser masturbating while watching gay pornography on his laptop. It sounds disgusting, but it quite economically communicates the central issues confronting the lead character, especially when he is caught in the act by a well-meaning fundamentalist missionary. Director Aronofsky is to be congratulated not only for guiding the actors, but for keeping the viewer interested in what happens next. This is no mean feat, given the set-up with very limited options. This is a good movie, worth seeing.",
  "The acting is great, but...": "A skinny heterosexual who leaves his wife and young daughter for another woman and then turns into a self-loathing house hermit because the girlfriend kills herself...not really the stuff that fills a theatre. But a grotesquely obese slob who watches gay porn and gorges himself until he vomits...now there's drama! Call me a curmudgeon, but I didn't buy any of it. The acting is great and I'd rate the movie a \"5\" for that alone, but long before the first hour was up, I was looking at my watch. The basic premise is worth a look, but the movie quickly runs out of ideas and the repetitive, freakshow nature of it all just grinds on and on.",
  "Beached, Stranded & Marooned...": "You've cocooned yourself inside a living hell, a place without escape, a prison cell, gorging on subways and pizza, you should try milk of magnesia, for the things you're having trouble to dispel. You're friend Liz, is going over and above, through generosity, through caring and for love, but when she comes around to measure, your inflationary blood pressure, the shutters close, towards the door she's shoved. A daughter you've not seen for quite some time, starts visiting and treating you like slime, but she can do no wrong, with her disrespectful tongue, as the vitriol envelopes and begrimes. You haven't always been a lonesome landlocked lubber, just since you lost your soul mate, partner, lover, now you're resigned to your own fate, but always see good, there's no hate, and if you have a heart, the end might make you blubber.Great performances, Brendan Fraser is overwhelming, Hong Chau superb as the steadfast friend, while Sadie Sink is poison personified as the daughter from hell.",
  "Brendan Fraser gives a compelling performance": "It's a drama about six people searching for meaning in life. It is set in a single room in Idaho in 2016 during the presidential primary season and follows a week in the life of a morbidly obese college English instructor.Charlie (Brendan Fraser) is the college instructor who gained most of his 600 pounds after his partner, Alan, committed suicide. Charlie left his wife, Mary (Samantha Morton), for Alan eight years earlier. He also left his daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), who is now 16 years old and an intelligent but embittered teenager. Charlie's nurse, Liz (Hong Chau), cares deeply for Charlie and is frustrated that he won't go to the hospital for treatment. Thomas (Ty Simpkins) is an evangelical missionary, apparently from the New Life Church, that believes without a doubt that God is the answer to Charlie's situation.Throughout the movie, these characters interact as they come to see Charlie. The metaphor of Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\" hovers in the background and reappears at crucial times. The relationship between Charlie and Ellie, whom Charlie has not seen in eight years, is particularly sharp. Liz's chiding of Charlie while she enables his food addiction seems spot on. The Thomas character creates some interest as the movie progresses but is the weakest of the characters in the script. Evangelical Christianity does not come off well in \"The Whale.\"\"The Whale\" is a powerful movie that makes viewers yearn for a positive ending. The acting of all the characters is strong. One is almost repulsed by Brendan Fraser but compelled to watch his remarkable performance. This is not an action drama, but the script is very well done.",
  "I kept craving pizza, KFC and Three Musketeers watching this.": "On the flipside, I wasn't happy with Aronofsky's choice to give us a film sized inside a square - 1970's tube TV's aspect ratio, when many of us paid a lot of money for wide-screen TV's. That was constantly annoying throughout the entire film.But I did enjoy the fact this film had many layers to it, but I'm not sure that all those layers were executed properly. For example, the end result of how Thomas' family responded to Ellie's actions is a coin toss, and either result would've not defined Ellie's true intentions or her character. For that matter, Thomas' relevance in the film was also in question, and felt more like an unnecessary distraction instead of complimenting the narrative.The same goes for Ellie's character and her true feelings about her dad, and questioning her true character; was she a hateful troubled teenager, or did she actually have a caring and loving side. The filmmakers didn't leave that too much in question, and had me convinced she actually was that terrible teenager, which ultimately detracts from the final scene.I've never seen the play, but as a film, just those few issues needed more exploration and cohesion with the films narrative, and I feel the filmmakers could've done a better job with Ellie and Thomas' characters. The rest of the characters, especially Liz, were portrayed properly, especially Fraser's character.Nevertheless, it's a well done film, and an outstanding award winning-worthy performance by Fraser. I know the critics were a little hard on this film, but it's still worthy for a one-time viewing.",
  "a work of art": "Being adapted from a stage play, this movie feels very much so (think august Osage county, ma Rainey's black bottom, the father) where the characters, the acting, and dialogue is on full display while the production design, cinematography, etc. Remained subtle and quiet. Stage play movies might not be everyone's cup of tea but wow, was this story so beautiful and soulfully-human.The guy next to me left the theater SOBBING.I overheard some audience members hating the daughter (Ellie) which was ironic considering the central theme. Yes, Ellie was a POS, but every single bitter, hateful action, as much as it hurt, came with a kernel of care and had surprising consequences. What a profound lesson to be able to find empathy when it's so much easier to hate.Great characters and thoughtful writing, with a specific and timely take on such an old theme.And Brendan Fraser gave such a courageous, vulnerable performance, he's a shoe-in for a best lead actor Oscar.",
  "Depressing": "I found this film quite depressing. A morbidly obese man living out his last days wheezing and moaning. The plot was not very compelling. It appears Charlie, an English teacher, was at one time married with a daughter. He left that behind 8 years prior after falling in love with a male student, abandoning his daughter. In those 8 years his gay lover it appears committed suicide, and as a result Charlie started eating himself to death. The timeline seems a little short for this progression to me. His daughter Ellie renters his life, and she is really an unlikeable, miserable person with zero redeeming qualities. Mixed in is also some sort of boy pretending to be a missionary??? He keeps coming back trying to save Charlie, but his back story is revealed and it makes little sense. Charlie is cared for by his ex lovers sister, a nurse that while caring for him, enables him to continue his slow suicide. None of these characters add much to the story, all are unlikeable. Brendan Frazier did a wonderful job playing this broken fat soul. That's about it. The movie itself was pretty lousy, the supporting characters were forgettable. I wouldn't say not to watch, but don't expect much other than being repulsed and depressed.",
  "Easy on the trans fats, Brendan...": "Oh my god. I came very close to crying and I don't easily do that. Brendan Frasier's character and performance deeply moved me and gave me a lot of perspective. He represents the frustration, despair, and loneliness that the vast majority of us experienced during the pandemic. The Whale is the story of a gay man who loses his lover, falls into depression, engorges himself with fast food upon fast food, blows up like a weather balloon and refuses medical attention because he would much prefer the sweet deliverance of a heart attack. But before he departs from Earth, he attempts to repair his relationship with his estranged daughter and to see if he has done one good thing in his life. It's a powerful tale that nobody is beyond redemption. If Brendan Frasier doesn't win an Oscar, I will be VERY upset. Also, I would like to address the woke mob criticizing the fact that a non-obese actor is playing an obese character and saying, \"Don't even TRY to put yourself in their shoes because you could NEVER know!\" First of all, the main point of acting is NOT being yourself for a few minutes, to gain perspective and experience. Second of all, should only obese actors play obese characters? Because a lot of them would not be comfortable doing that. Third of all, casting should be based on merit as much as accuracy. The best possible actor should be chosen for the role and Brendan Frasier has proven himself in this case, which is why The Whale merits a 10/10.P. S. This film was surprisingly tame by Darren Aronofsky's standards. I was expecting at least three nightmarish scenes based on his previous films like Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan.",
  "The Whale": "Highly emotionally charged beautiful film about a morbidly obese on-line English teacher, close to death, relating to a middle age Asian care giver, his teenage daughter and a disenfranchised schoolboy evangelist. Later on his divorced wife appears to add her side of the story.All filmed in the same room and no comedy or action scenes elsewhere.References to Moby Dick and the poems of Walter Whitman in 1850 are an intriguing attraction.It constantly rains throughout the film but I've missed any significant meaning for this apart from a possible indication of depression - very low barometric pressure.He deserves to get an Oscar for this.",
  "Very Emotional...........": "If I could use two words to describe The Whale, it would be very emotional. From beginning to end, The Whale just breaks your heart and will almost always make you cry. First off, Darren Aronofsky is a very good director with fantastic films on his record like Black Swan, Requiem For A Dream and The Wrestler to name a few. And in all those films, he always hits you very hard with his emotion in his movies. But in my opinion, none hit more hard then The Whale. The acting in the film felt so real from Brendan Fraser and Sadie Sink, that every scene is very emotionally driven for its big conclusion. Overall, this is a fantastic film that will keep your attention for the entire runtime.",
  "High in tastelessness, low in gravitas": "The Whale (2022) - Darren Aronofsky: A ReviewThere was a time when Aronofsky looked to be one of the most promising directors in American cinema. His pulsating black-and-white low-budget \"Pi\" was remarkable in its intensity, pacing and chaotic energy. Then came the modern classic \"Requiem for a Dream\" in which Aronofsky somehow injected even more chaos and drama, this time coupled with stellar performances by Jennifer Connelly and Ellen Burnstyn, alongside a hypnotic, pulverising soundtrack and a general atmosphere of unrelenting anguish to unsettle the nerves of the most sanguine viewer. Since then the director has mostly floundered; yes, there have been bright sparks from time-to-time: \"The Wrestler\" was a worthy character study of a flawed individual, brought to life wonderfully by Mickey Rourke, while \"Black Swan\" provided a similar canvass for Natalie Portman to give what is quite possibly a career-best performance but at no point has the director fully capitalised on the genius that seemed inherent within his film-making almost a quarter of a century ago now.Ironically, as the director has grown older, his films seem to have become more adolescent. In 2017 we got the utterly ridiculous \"Mother!\" and now, finally moving onto the subject of this review, we are presented with the only slightly less ridiculous \"The Whale\": a film about a morbidly obese man who is on the point of a fatal heart attack. Based on the play by Samuel D Hunter, this film almost certainly has nothing to say, but that doesn't stop it from indulgently pontificating on religion, sexuality, grief and the importance of family. Allow me to observe here that when a dramatist has no particular insight on any topic, it is a common trick for him to distract the viewer from noticing this by spreading his themes as widely as possible. One should be under no illusion that any profundity is occurring in this film and there are a number of clues to suggest this.Firstly, none of the characters' motivations are properly thought out. We have a central character, Charlie (played by Brendan Fraser), who is homosexual (the importance of this will become apparent later) and apparently suicidal . He has developed a co-dependent friendship with the fiercely protective Liz (Hong Chau). Liz is depicted as finding value in the dependence that Charlie has on her, so much so that she attempts to prevent her friend from reconnecting with his daughter lest her role in his life be usurped. Yet, so desperate is she to maintain his friendship that she continues to feed him fried chicken and brings him highly-unhealthy snacks, all the while being acutely aware of how close this food is to killing him. It is worth noting here that Liz is also a nurse, something which might lead one to believe that her instinct would be to avoid perpetuating life-shortening habits vis-a-vis her closest friends.Then there is Charlie's daughter, Ellie, from whom he has been estranged for almost a decade. He calls her after he realises the perilousness of his health and she comes to visit him immediately. She is standoffish and hostile but it is made clear to her that there will be a financial and possibly an educational advantage in associating with him. At times it seems as if she is motivated purely by self-interest, at other times she appears driven by motiveless malignity and then, less plausibly perhaps, she appears to be doing acts of great kindness in a roundabout and easily misinterpreted fashion. By the end of the film, all three of these interpretations could easily be true and it comes across as if neither the writer nor the director decided what Ellie's motivations actually were. You could call this artistic ambiguity, I call it a lack of interest in character development. After all, if a character is not particularly defined in any substantial way then they can behave as the writer wishes them to in order to serve the preconceived plot. The character of Ellie does this as does the character of Liz as does, most importantly, the character of Charlie himself.Taking a closer look at Charlie we see a kind, gentle almost childlike individual. He is suffering from grief, hence his extreme comfort eating, but, as an English teacher by profession, he is still capable of being moved by beautiful, honest writing. This in and of itself appears to possess the whiff of something fay but I shall just about allow it to pass. The main issue with Charlie's characterisation is that he is far too kind, gentle and caring to ever be capable of the emotional and physical abandonment of which his character is purportedly responsible. All of the invective and hostility that Charlie receives at the hands of his estranged family in the film is utterly justified by Charlie's past actions and yet Fraser's angelic performance provides not even a scintilla of evidence of the callousness he has previously been responsible for. At one point in the film, his ex-wife says that she is aware that Charlie was only using her to have a child. The audience is unsure whether to interpret this as bitterness or honesty and, once again, I don't think either the writer or director cared to decide themselves in which category the comment belonged. However, its truth would make perfect sense since Charlie is very clearly represented as being gay in the film, right from the very first scene in fact. Yet how could such a kind, genuine man who is so powerfully moved by honesty be capable of such cynical deception? It does not fit with the character that is being projected in any conceivable way.Focusing on the character of Charlie takes me back to my observations regarding the adolescent nature of Aronofsky's more recent cinematic fare. Too much of this film includes \"fat jokes\", including the film's title itself. Oh, of course, this can easily be denied: it's a reference to \"Moby Dick\", it's a reference to the Biblical story of Noah (there's another Aronofsky association by the way). It is also, naturally, a reference to the protagonist's size. There is also too much prurient fascination with the physical degradation associated with being morbidly obese. Virtually nothing is left to the audience's imagination in terms of Charlie's impaired physicality. This doesn't stop with his outward appearance but continues to the unfortunate condition of the protagonist's heart, something which is monitored and tracked in anxiety-inducing detail throughout the film.The film is, quite simply, in poor taste and severely lacking in artistic merit in terms of its writing, its exposition of its themes and its characterisation; however, it would be extremely disingenuous of me to claim that I found no merit in the film at all. The acting is impeccable throughout. Give Aronofsky his due, like Stanley Kubrick, he excels in eliciting powerful, tortured performances from his cast. Fraser has rightly received many plaudits for his performance, the humanity he is able to exude is heart-warming and, at times, deeply moving but he is also ably supported by Sadie Sink, Ty Simpkins, Samantha Morton and, especially, Hong Chau as his erstwhile yet viperishly domineering side-kick. Bearing in mind that the characterisations are so poorly thought out, it is even more impressive that the actors are able to deliver such impressive work. They succeed by playing scenes as much as by playing characters, the actors being malleable and flexible enough to fully deliver to the scenes' requirements without ever appearing false in their performances.The soundtrack is also beautiful and hauntingly atmospheric. If there is so much that is tasteless in the writing and presentation of the film, the music is the exact opposite. Rob Simonsen's tones elevate the film and provide it with an otherwise unearned dignity and grace. And then there are the visual flourishes of which Aronofsky is always immensely capable. The film's use of light in key scenes and the way in which Aronofsky is able to visually invigorate what is essentially a one-set film is commendable and adds value to the experience.Due to the power of individual scenes, you may well leave this film quite moved by what you've watched but, if you are critical by nature and you are inclined to do the maths, you will be hard-pressed not to realise that this film does not add up. Like a number of Aronofsky's recent efforts, it's a film whose main goal is to grab you by the jugular and, in its insistence on achieving this, it is far more trivial than it had any need to be.",
  "Pretentious Disaster: One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen!": "The fact that people think that this movie deserves oscars and awards is absolutely crazy to me. The plot and writing are a convoluted mess. They really try to be deep but fail miserably. This has to be one of the most depressing, miserable, annoying and disturbing movies I've ever seen, also boring. I really want my money and time back, watched it in theatre. Three times I wanted to get up and leave but I was curious to see how it ends. Well the ending was disappointing and pointless just like I expected. This movie is supposed to be about a dying man who is very sick because of obesity complications, trying to reconnect with his daughter, trying to right his wrongs.Too little too late my friend. You literally wait till the end of your life to do what's right? I can't decide which character in this movie is the most toxic. Is it Charlie? He refuses to seek help for his problems or go to the hospital, choosing death over life. It's obvious that Charlie has complex psychiatric issues, including an eating disorder, severe depression, suicidal tendencies and more. Also did he leave his family to be with his boyfriend, like wtf? Super toxic. Liz, his friend/nurse instead of trying to help him change his life and habits just brings him more food to continue the deadly cycle, just put him in a hospital, he obviously won't do it himself, he wants to die and Liz helps him with that.Charlie keeps calling his daughter an amazing person etc while Ellie is an absolutely toxic person who has only bad things to say about him and any other person she meets. She literally takes pictures, records conversations and humiliates people. The way she talks to her father is disgusting, telling him that she doesn't care if he dies or not and that she cares more about her high school exams, money or whatever else, wtf is wrong with her. She is 17, this is unacceptable behavior. My father wasn't around while I was growing up but I would never talk to him like this.Thomas is a pointless character, his actions made no sense. He existed only as an excuse for the writers to make fun and humiliate people who have faith in God. The whole movie tries really hard and attacks the idea of God and faith in general, every chance they get. The methods they used to do that were absolutely pathetic and felt forced. At some point it got really annoying. The only character that wasn't extremely annoying was Ellie's mother. Many think it's a fatphobic movie. I don't know if i agree with that but I know for sure that this movie makes obese people look very very bad.I don't know what to say about this movie. The writing is awful and sends all the wrong messages. Tries to be deep but isn't. The only good thing has to be Brendan Fraser's performance and that's the only reason I will not give it 1/10 rating. My rating is 2/10. Skip this movie, it's painful.",
  "Emotionally Heavy w/ an Incredible Lead Actor": "I don't know that I am capable of writing a review good enough to capture this movie's depth but I'll try. The entire movie is devastating and holds no punches, the tragic tale addresses one of the only forms of addiction we as a society seem to have deemed unacceptable to accept/understand. Instead, treating it as if it were a disgusting choice made by those who suffer from it. While mental health and substance abuse have become movements we strife to improve upon, food addiction is treated as though the person is simply lazy or stupid. I'm sure most of us, myself included, are guilty of those subconscious thoughts.This isn't a lecture but I ensure you this isn't the case with food addiction. If you believe it is take the time to google leptin resistance, epigenetic role in obesity (ob gene), and the various forms of microbiome development.. This is my request as an obese medical student who finds himself in awkward positions and feeling like a hypocrite in many patient interactions.Beyond the looming subject of food addiction the film further interwinds the treatment of the LGBTQ+ community and how religion participates in the historical treatment of those within the community. The relationships Charlie forms with his friends and family and even random strangers. Such as Dan the pizza man, who is friendly and kind until the day he seems Charlie, at which time all of which changes. Or his students, who upon a face reveal instead of being kind or even normal, appear disgusted or as if they want to snicker at his appearance.There is likely a great deal of symbolism I am missing in the film. Such as the bird and its plate, which then break just prior to Charlie's death. If you haven't, watch the movie for yourself.Acting: 10/10\nStory: 10/10\nEmotion: 10/10\nEffects: - No need.Cinematography: 10/10, overly simple, boring, dark, all of which add to the film's purpose.",
  "The Hero and The Villain": "On the surface, The Whale can come off as a fairly simple film. Possibly one we have all seen before in our lifetime. However, this film is quite different than you'd think. When you break it down, we follow a man who the film presents in two ways. The hero, and the villain.The master performances from Fraser, Sink, Chau, Simpkins, and Morton bring so much depth and personality to the film. The beautiful, yet haunting score, the gorgeous claustrophobic cinematography all further encapsulates you in this brutal story of redmeption, and self-struggle. Making the point clearly that nobody is perfect. We all have that heroism in us, as well as a darker villainous part. People have issues and torments that live with them that they can't shake off. The fact this film captured that in such a different and unique way, the film managed to completely moved me like no other film this year.When you get the chance, please see this film.",
  "Great story set in one location": "The start of this movie you kinda need to get into it especially get pass the gross stuff that happens, but once that is past, the real emotional journey of the story start, with one heck of an ending. I understand why this movie got a standing ovation!And this whole movie pretty much just takes place in one locations and it isn't even boring because of this. As a good story don't have to have tons of locations. You get to see the emotional struggles of charlie, though this movie is about an obese person, it isn't a cliche story about how he become healthy but far the opposite of it.Acting from all the actors were really good and Brendan Fraser definitely deserve to get oscar awards for this role.",
  "Poignant": "It's rather interesting to see how Darren Aronofsky includes critical themes without even mentioning it in the plot or as dialogues. You enter into the life of Charlie (Brendan Fraser) who is currently reeling under pressure from his nurse due to his ill health caused by overating ultra processed food. This particular point of the cause of his obesity is never mentioned in the film as it proceeds to establish Charlie's character from his own as well of others' points of view. And by the end, you feel a lot of emotions barging in without your permission as you realize the virtues of companionship and fatherhood. It made my eyes wet.(Watched at the International Film Festival of Kerala in Trivandrum.)",
  "Watch it for Brendan": "I feel torn when it comes to The Whale, because there are parts of it that I think are really well done and other parts that miss the mark. It suffers when it comes to writing and pacing, and isn't quite as visually dynamic or cohesive as most of Darren Aronofsky's films, but succeeds when it comes to acting (and parts of it are moving, at least during the scenes that are well-written).Brendan Fraser's great of course, and it's worth watching the movie for him. If he wins the Oscar for his performance, I think it'll feel like a deserved win. He does more than just letting the prosthetics and special effects do the work for him, and when it comes to the things he has to do physically and emotionally, he's remarkable.Elsewhere, Hong Chau and Sadie Sink are both very good, but I do question the writing of the latter's character. I also didn't think the characters of Thomas and Charlie's ex-wife were very consistently written or interesting at all, but would blame that more on the writing than the performances of their actors. I'm not sure anyone could make them feel like real people with the material here. Sink's character also feels like a caricature, but she does well considering what she's given.It's all a bit boring visually (even by the standards of one-location movies), and I didn't love the pacing (even if it builds to an ending that's solid). I mean, some things also felt telegraphed and on-the-nose a little too much- I just didn't really think this was well-written or paced, and lacked the visual oomph of Aronofsky's other movies.But Fraser's great, as are the other actors, and it's unique and emotional in parts. I can see some loving this and some hating it. I really liked parts, and wasn't crazy about other parts, but still feel like it ends up being decent overall.",
  "\"I Need to Know that I've Done One Thing Right in my Life\"": "The Whale is one of those rare gems where you literally forget about your surroundings and completely invest in the emotionally draining story, the fabulous direction and the Oscar-worthy performances each unfolding on screen. If you're familiar with director Darren Aronofsky's previous melodramatic, surreal or psychological projects, it shouldn't come as a surprise that this one is worth a nomination due to its intense emotional power.The entire film, other than a couple of scenes, is set mainly in one room in the apartment of a morbidly obese English teacher, and the film covers a week in which he attempts to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter while he suffers from obesity. The Whale isn't at all the case of leaving you messed up for some time after you watch them, which how Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream and Mother! Work. But it still proves he has the talent for executing raw concepts you get sucked into very quickly.On the other hand, Brendan Fraser's role in this movie is a completely seperate talent. He truly gives the performance of a lifetime as he plays Charlie, the main character suffering from morbid obesity who takes the spotlight in this movie. Seriously, no words can describe his (no pun intended) incredibly heavy and hard-moving acting skills he gets the opportunity to show us. The Whale is a very entertaining and marvellously directed, yet just above only an average and decently-written experience. But the stars shoot right up because of Brendan Fraser. Being able to portray frustration and obvious care with Charlie, Stranger Things' actress Sadie Sink and every other supporting role deserves major acclaim as well.Plenty of films today rely on convincing performances to engage us in a story that's completely uninteresting, boring and unoriginal, and they still turn out to be rubbish movies with good casting. But Brendan Fraser makes this movie entertaining, he makes you empathise with his character and he overall just makes you forget you're watching a screenplay roll out. This film feels like real life and you actually feel like there's an entire life's story that stretches beyond the movie. Another element this film relies on is its soundtrack, which critics are claiming it's used unnecessarily and displays a lack of trust in the actors, but the soundtrack is honestly beautiful and increases the emotions of many scenes, especially the unusually bittersweet ending.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",
  "Weakend the source material; solid and over-hyped": "As an avid A24 fan I knew I would see this film, yet I hesitated, turned-off by a film about a fat person played by an actor in a fat suit. Ultimately the acting is what carries this film- Brendan has incredible access to his emotions and portrays Charlie beautifully. Sadie and Hong are also wonderful. If you are a Brendan fanatic excited for his return to film, you won't be disappointed, although I caution that a lot of the hype around this film stems from that excitement and overlooks the slow pace, distractingly blunt cuts, and stilted delivery of supporting actors toward the end of the film.I read the play first out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised to find it isn't a mockery of fat folk; all the characters are complex and interesting, and there are many full circle things that come around satisfyingly in the end. I was interested to see the adaptation, and was disappointed to sit through a slow-moving film that changed and added things to a less satisfying, at times detrimental effect. Less satisfying was the altering of Alan's story, removing some emotional beats in the play that I was looking forward to seeing on screen. In the play, Alan, Charlie's deceased boyfriend, is raised religious, and goes on a mission abroad to avoid going home and getting married. When he does go home he ends up falling in love with Charlie and completely abandoning the church. There is a point about the last day Alan goes to church, he hears his father give a sermon that breaks him. After this he becomes so depressed he starves himself to death. Then, after his death, Charlie eats himself to death. We finally find out what Alan's father said in the sermon: the story of Jonah and the Whale. In the film this is altered: no Jonah sermon, but Alan's Bible has a verse about living in the flesh marked off; I supposed it was altered so as not to be so \"on the nose\", given the 'Moby Dick' essay which Charlie reads again and again throughout the play/film, which we ultimately find out his daughter wrote, but in a story laden with metaphor, I didn't think this second allusion was too much. To the film's detriment: the small age difference between Charlie and Alan in the play wasn't specified, making Charlie look like a groomer who seduced a student (a damaging trope in stories with queer characters), and, more egregiously, an added scene that was not in the play featuring Charlie being seen by the pizza delivery guy, which triggers shame and then a massive binge the night before his death. There is no reason to include this in the film. At this point we have already seen Charlie vulnerable and hurting, we've seen his shame, we as an audience already feel compassion for him- this added scene felt intended to disturb the audience and remind them of those stereotypes- \"if you're that size you must be doing something wrong, you are out of control, and you should be ashamed\". The play did not have this scene, and the film didn't need it.",
  "Brendan Will Take Home the Oscar (barring a complete Academy melt-down in sensibility)": "Brendan Frasier delivers an All-In performance in 'The Whale'. It's HIGHLY likely to produce an Oscar and deservedly so.The film is sad, sweet, tragic and thought-provoking, and the screenplay provides enough twists in the plot to keep one engaged throughout.But let's not be delusional, this is Brendan's film, as he holds the spotlight from beginning to end - his performance is moving and unforgettable, and so OW* that NOT awarding him the Statuette would be one of the all-time worst Oscar-snubs by the Academy.The only reason I even mention this is the recent history of such snubs over the past two years (Ben Affleck/Tender Bar, and Ralph Fiennes/The Dig). Brendan's nomination brings some comfort that the sensibility of voters has returned this year after a two-year Covid-fever lapse in judgement of not even nominating the aforementioned Actors and films (sorry, I just wanted to take one more shot at the Academy on those two mega-snubs \ud83d\ude09).If you haven't seen the film, that is understandable as it has only recently became available for non-theatre viewing, and at the purchase price of $20 on Amazon Prime (even the wily Russian film-hacking sites don't yet have a copy...thankfully). Well worth the investment if you can afford it.Two thumbs-up for The Whale and Brendan Fraser!\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d*Oscar Worthy.",
  "Moby Dick": "\"The Whale\" was probably my most anticipated movie of the end of the year. I've been waiting for it ever since it was first announced. But I can't say that it lived up to the hype.Most of \"The Whale\" was great. It depicts a story of Charlie, a morbidly obese man played by Brandon Fraser, who is reaching his end of life and try to make reconciliation with his daughter. I thought it was a brave depiction of a morbidly obese character (though there is original story for this). I didn't find it fatphobic like some critics did as I thought it was a realistic and candid depiction of what it's like to live in a larger body. Brandon Fraser, Sadie Sink (personal bias from Stranger Things) and Hong Chau all pulled their weight with especially Fraser being the constant throughout the movie. I hope that Sink gets more role in the future that goes beyond an angsty teenager because there was frankly lots of overlap between Ellie and Max from Stranger Things. It was also good to see familiar faces of Samantha Morton (from Walking Dead, Alpha) and Ty Simpkins (insidious and MCU).Although the performances were great, some of the lines were a little trite and broke my immersion in the movie. They were often shouted at to the audience what they were trying to say and there was lack of subtlety. As the movie got to the ending, it tried so hard to squeeze out the emotions from the audience and I was close to buying it. But in the end, I was confused by what the story was trying to tell you. Charlie himself tells you multiple times to be honest but he himself was not honest to Liz about the money. And if he was ever fully honest to himself, he may have tried to get help about the way he handled grief, which was overeating. It could be that he is a complex character who didn't practice his preach but it didn't feel that way during the movie. Perhaps he needed a little less optimism to take a frank hard look at himself. I did like the way the story tried to handle grief, remorse, guilt and self-loathing that come in many different forms. The religious bit was also very relatable and I found it almost comical to some extent. To me, it's always touching to see broken people performed well on screen.\"A pot of complex emotions like guilt, remorse, and grief. But the pot was forced down too fast\"",
  "A Fridge Too Far": "Darren Aronofsky has always trafficked in extreme scenarios and grotesque images to convey either addiction or obsession, depending on the film. His scripts would be comic in how OTP they are if they weren't bolstered by flourishes of hyper-intense editing, sound design, score, and photography. I know this because The Whale lacks many of those flourishes until its final act, where they arrive with all the enthusiasm of a student late for a (video) lecture. That's not a slight against the look and sound of the film; it's fine. It's Aronofsky at his most impartial, which makes the extremely repulsive dramatic beats of the film - including but not limited to heart attack masturbation, Brendan Fraser inhaling pizzas, Brendan Fraser vs gravity, and Sadie Sink being the world's most terrible teenager, if not person - hilarious. The filmmaking doesn't mix with the story being told, that's the problem.I don't imagine too many people would legitimately object to the film's framing of morbid obesity as bad. No sane person would consider Charlie's lifestyle and body shape anything other than an illness or malformation. It is perhaps condescending at times, certainly. The scene where Brendan Fraser cannot pick up a key because of his extreme corpulence has the same feel as that episode of The Simpsons where Homer becomes obese. The fat suit prosthetic is not at all convincing, though I don't dispute the need for it. I can think of no working actor who is Charlie's size, and even if there was, there'd be something perverse about ensuring they remained that size throughout production, like enabling a drug addiction. What IS extraordinarily offensive in the film's messaging, though, is its strong and seemingly intentional message that cyberbullying at worst is an authentic expression of the self, and at best an act of charity.The elephant, or whale, in the room is the matter of Brendan Fraser's acting. Is he good? Of course he is. Not Oscar winning material, but perhaps Oscar nominee material. He makes a character that is a near-saint feel real. The stagey script always pushes these anguished declarations from Charlie of how much of a martyr he is. Fraser has to fight against a narrative pull toward a sort of Christ for fat people, countering the resistible impression left from scene after scene of self-pity.Everyone in the film is good, maybe excluding Sink. She's supposed to imbue Ellie with a hidden empathy, but I never saw it in her performance. Such a disappointment from one of my favourite directors.",
  "Brilliant work, done by the whole team!": "I'm not a fan of Aronofsky, although I adore \"Pi\", but this one is a big surprise, in every way, where every second is deep, emotionally. Even if you are a tough guy, who is against someone's sexual orientation, for sure during watching this masterpiece your feelings will be moved, cause it isn't the point of that direction. The main character shows us the final of process of punishing himself for all the bad things he did to the others to that level to look disgusting to everyone. The other characters are there to give him guidelines that he isn't the only person in that play, but... Rob Simonsen's score is brilliantly attached to the story and the sound of the rainy days gives us even stronger compassion toward Charlie, played by Brendan Fraser, who is unforgettable in that role, and should be awarded. However, it is as an excellent theater performance in which all the characters are great, as Charlie says in the movie, AMAZING! :)",
  "\"I was always big. I let it get out of control.\"": "I didn't expect Brendan Fraser's character to be so utterly obese. He's easily twice the size of Tom Hanks' Colonel Parker in \"Elvis\", and that's saying something. The film is an emotional roller coaster as Fraser's character Charlie resolves at all times to be understanding and accepting of the deficiencies of his daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink), caregiver Liz (Hong Chau), and ex-wife Mary (Samantha Morton). They can scream and curse him all day long and he sees only the good in them. It gets a little frustrating at times because you would think he'd strike back. This is not a comfortable movie to watch given Charlie's agony just breathing, with no attempt to seek medical help for his condition, as if serving penance for the life he led and the family he abandoned to pursue a gay relationship. I'm not sure what to make of Ellie's decision to send pictures and recordings of self described missionary Tom (Ty Simpkins) to his parents and former New Life congregation. It felt cruel and punitive, and yet was met with acceptance and love by the young man who needed to reconnect with his family back home. Excellent performances all around, and I'll go out on a limb here to predict Brendan Fraser will come home with a Best Actor Oscar this film cycle. The irony is that the picture itself wasn't included in the running for Best Picture, since in my estimation, it surpasses at least two of the contenders I've seen which I feel don't have quite what it takes to make the cut. Keep a Kleenex handy watching this one, you may need it.",
  "Welcome back Brendan": "This movie was incredible and if Brendan doesn't get his Oscar then I won't watch that show anymore. He's so deserving of best actor. I'm still crying and I left the theater an hour ago. The whole cast was amazing. Sadie was fantastic and I forgot who played his nurse but she deserves a nod too. Even Samantha Morton was great. Such a heart breaking story but amazingly acted. It's about love, forgiveness and honesty. Mostly honesty. I've always loved Brendan Fraser ever since Encino Man. He's so damn incredible in this role. You'll be rooting for him on Oscar night. I guarantee it. A must see!!!",
  "If You Don't Change, Who Will?": "Brendan Fraiser's character is sad. He has lost someone dear to him. Thus, creating a tragic health cycle creating a massive obesity that truly devastated him. Financial problems that caused his wife and daughter to hate him. His refusal to go to the hospital due to his financial problems, only creates a certain hopelessness. Happiness is lost. That explains his rejection towards God. The only issue is that every single person has some sort of stubbornness and pride that we won't let go. I guess we obviously don't value our health, family, and the people around us. Just remember this, you control you. No one else can make you change but you. What would it take for you to change your old bad habits? When can you do about it? Time goes on. The Whale delivers it job well performance. Just remember to take the lessons that was shown in the movie.",
  "Towering lead performance by Brendan Fraser": "As \"The Whale\" (2022 release; 117 min) opens, Charlie, an obese, is teaching an online class, keeping his camera off. He.is cared for by his friend Liz, a nurse. She warns him that he is at severe risk of congestive heart failure, but Charlie refuses her suggestion to go to the hospital. Then one day out of the blue, Charlie us visited by Ellie, his estranged daughter who is now a HS senior...Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Darren Aronofsky (Requiem For a Dream\", \"The Wrestler\"). Here he brings the theater play of the same name by Samuel Hunter to the big screen. The movie doesn't betray its theater roots and in fact the entire film plays out in Charlie's apartment. There are a lot of heavy duty discussions in this film, a sizeable portion on religion, of all things. The cast is outstanding, including Hong Chau (as Liz) and. Sadie Sink (as Ellie). But the film will be mostly remembered for the towering performance by Brandon Fraser as the obese Charlie. I read that it took 4 hours each day to get the prosthetics arranged. Of course none of this would've mattered if it weren't for the high quality script by Samuel Hunter (who also wrote the stage play). In all, I didn't know how I would react to this film, obvious Oscar-baiting material. Turns out this is solid film starring a staggering performance by Fraser. Mark my words: for sure he will get a Best Actor Oscar nod and he is probably a strong favorite to win it. Hollywood just loves a good comeback story like this one,\"The Whale\" premiered at Venice film festival in September yo immediate critical acclaim. It opened in US theaters some 2-3 weeks ago. The day-after-Christmas early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended so-so (I counted about 15-20 people). If you are in the mood for a heavy duty drama starring a towering Brendan Fraser, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",
  "Outstanding Performances, Mediocre Material": "While Brendan Fraser has the most showy role, all of the cast members turn in outstanding performances which are the main reasons to see this film. Darren Aronofsky mostly keeps what story there is moving forward and being compelling. Adapted from a play, the single-setting film overly-emphasizes its dialogue and is visually uninteresting other than perhaps encouraging viewers to marvel at Brendan Fraser's makeup. Before reaching its somewhat predictable ending, the film begins to lose a little steam. Touching on many topics, the film invites audiences to discern meaning from the viewing experience, but the film is subtle enough that meaning may elude some audiences.",
  "Surprisingly relatable...": "Wow, this is inspiring filmmaking- one location, strong writing, real relationships & real issues about raising a troubled child, imminent death, opposing views on Christianity, gluttony/addiction and the shame that comes with it, etc. The film is honest, sincere, painful, confusing, complicated yet loving and hopeful.I came in for Brendan Fraser and stayed for the story. I was moved from the start. Here's Charlie- he's trapped, sad, sick and lonely. Who hasn't felt this way? I didn't feel like I was watching Charlie, I felt like I was right there with him. Yes, he's dying from morbid obesity but underneath his physical deterioration is a soul starving of love without condition. Those character traits were expressed very well visually through the acting and direction.Wasn't a 10 for me because I didn't love the ending. The culmination of hopeful emotion and possible restoration of Charlie & his daughter weren't represented as well as it could have, with the use of a quick metaphorical flash of ...wait, what? It just took me out of the movie and I felt dissatisfied. I wanted to see more change from his daughter to trust all the good Charlie sees in her. Charlie reached his own version of heaven but maybe there was a better way to show it rather than his feet suddenly lifting off the ground.I also just disagreed with the actions of the character, Liz. The actress herself, Chau, was a believable nurse and her anger and pain seethed through the screen. But her relentless meanness to Thomas, who probably showed the most love to Charlie, was inexcusable. She had the right to disagree with Thomas' worldview but it doesn't justify her incessant rudeness toward the kid, who is more than just his religion. It is plain to see in this movie that we don't have to act hateful to people who have opposing views as us. Thomas didn't agree with Liz, but he didn't act spiteful towards her. Even Charlie's own daughter, who is atheistic herself, showed love to him (in the most unconventional way). We're all human and want real love more than anything in life. I think this type of thinking was shown when Charlie, at his breaking point, asked his students to write something real for once to reveal to them that, \"Just cause I look like a whale, I'm really not that different from you. You're hurting on the inside too, just like me.\" Maybe this attitude in life can make the difference in finding real unity despite our differences. I love the discussions that can come out from this movie. This is one of those movies I would watch over and over again, for different reasons each time :)",
  "Visceral but Hollow": "This film is an adaptation of a play, so there were bound to be some restraints on the breadth of its spectacle. It becomes immediately apparent that this film was made as a stage adaptation, not a cinematic reimagining. That's fine and all, there are definitely a solid share of movies that have very narrow parameters in terms of the set and cast, but that it still felt like a stage production greatly diminished what of its effect it could have accomplished. Theatre, for the most part, is intended as a means of visually telling a character story. It counters the spectacle of the world-at-large by instead studying the spectacle of character. What we have in much of cinema today is a continuation of that ideal, but the feat of cinema is that anything that people can see or imagine be filmed or animated - it is a widening of the horizon of theatrical storytelling from a singular frame to seeing as far as the mind can take you, in real-time. It's why filmmakers, including Aronofsky, are so revered as magicians who can create a medium that embodies the imagination. Visual storytellers who combine set and acting and music and sounds to create a tangible embodiment of the story they want to tell. It's as close as we can get right now to experiencing a story other than actually living it. So when it feels like I'm watching something that takes a step back and operates more in the vein of theatre, it feels hollow.That's not to say that I haven't been moved by theatrical productions in the past, the element of watching real actors on a stage in the same room as you adds a lot to the overall effect. The Whale does not have that. In fact, I'd say it feels overly caught up in that it is an adaptation of a stage production, and while it wants to create an experience with being a film that Aronofsky is talented at making, it ultimately loses itself somewhere in the middle.Now, I'm someone who is extremely generous when it comes to viewing art. Contrivance is generally the main element that bothers me when it comes to how critical I want to be when watching a piece of cinema or listening to music, etc. The more authentic something is, the harder it is for me to actively notice a piece art being contrived, both in the nature of authenticity but also the level of immersion achieved by the piece. Pi, for example, was very immersive because it was very authentic in its telling of its story. The same could be said of Black Swan and The Wrestler. As far as authentic cinematic storytelling goes, it's hard to find those films overly contrived, or lose the feeling of immersion because they feel inauthentic. Noah, on the other hand, feels a lot more like Hollywood shenanigans and like someone who was given a budget that they weren't used to trying to make as big a spectacle as possible. Big budget films don't have to be overly spectacular, they often are, but when they are, they often fail at being authentic. So, Aronofsky has shown that he can make something that isn't the most authentic filmmaking, and in The Whale, I'd be remiss if I didn't admit that a lot of the movie felt contrived; kept me from feeling appropriately immersed, especially for a film that is supposed to be an adaptation of a stage production, which, again, is a study of the spectacle of character.To be contrived here really diminishes the overall quality of the film. The material the film is based on is moving, but not particularly so that it deserves to be adapted to film. Which is fine, that becomes the responsibility of those involved in the creation of the film, but especially the director's and the actors' responsibility. For the most part, the acting was fine. The side characters felt believable, but, and quite unfortunately, when one performance shines through as exceptional, it really puts a burden on the other performers to keep up, which was not possible. Brendan Fraser became the other actors' white whale while they were trying to create characters that neither had enough life to them to begin with (thanks in part to some lackluster dialog and general characterization), nor had the panache to warrant space next to the main character. It was a story about his relationship with himself and with the other characters, not about their relationships with him, and the performance Brendan Fraser gave was one that didn't even afford the other actors the room to develop and perform their roles well enough to even be compared to his. Of course, comparing a single apple with a cart of cabbages - able to be made into months' worth of food - is futile, but the apple is still an adequate and enjoyable portion of food. Likewise, Brendan Fraser's performance really exists like a cart of cabbage in that there's a lot of it kind of stinks (not the performance but the character, and I'd imagine Brendan Fraser after getting out of the body suit every day).Charlie is kind of a rotten character - not of his own accord, necessarily, but definitely his lack of self-love makes it harder to empathize with him trying to love someone else. It's certainly relatable, but is very frustrating, and makes for a difficult time watching his arc transpire. That's fine, that doesn't necessarily diminish the quality of the film, but it just made it less enjoyable to watch at moments. Truly, Brendan Fraser's ability to bring this character to life is remarkable. Performance of the decade so far, and I really can't wait to se him explore these more authentic, human characters who give him room to shine and who he can paint in his own light.So, unfortunately, the sum of its parts is greater than the whole. I watched this movie to see Brendan Fraser's performance and to watch the new Aronofsky film. Brendan Fraser absolutely delivered, but it wasn't enough to make this film stand on its own merit. Aronofsky didn't exactly fall short, but he didn't exactly score what should have been a pretty easy home run either and ended up stuck in that middle ground of being more or less fine. If this movie cast someone else as Charlie and they gave a performance on par with the rest of the cast, I'd have given it around a 5, but it wasn't. Brendan Fraser absolutely killed it, so the visceral enjoyment of his performance absolutely elevated it quite a few steps. 6.5/10.",
  "What a dull boring tedious film this was": "So having read all the rave reviews we decided to give this a go , for us if we see someone winning or being nominated for awards it's usually a boring arty farty film , well we weren't wrong m so ok he plays a good part , but if you want to watch a whole film about a fat sweaty bloke with an annoying daughter and weird friend , then this is the film for you , for us we get more entertainment watching paint dry , can't even think of more things to say to fill the review because nothing happens , but fat gay sweaty bloke eating pizzas and drinking coke with an annoying daughter in a dark depressing flat says it all , couldn't even watch the last 15 minutes it's that bad .",
  "Brendan Fraser dropped a GOLIATH of a performance": "I just finished watching it. Shortly after the movie finished, not a single soul moved, not even a muscle. I think everyone needed time to really process our emotions. The film was just so beautiful, heart-wrenching, and represents exactly what makes them so moving for people.Brendan Fraser deserves an Oscar for this. There isn't a single shred of doubt in my mind. He carried the entire movie. A movie in which there is very little physical ways for Brendan Fraser to bring the character to life, which meant that 100% of it was communicated through his facial expressions and voice. An absolutely beautiful, incredibly nuanced performance.This isn't to disparage what any of the other actors accomplished, in no means. They all did a great job.",
  "Powerful and Touching Film": "I absolutely loved this film. I saw it alone and I'm glad I did. When the closing credits started rolling, the music and vibe was amazing, but I had to leave the theater right away. I really wanted to sit there longer and digest because I was so touched by the film. I rarely cry in films. :)I thought the acting top to bottom was amazing. Obviously Brendan Fraser, but I was really taken by Sadie Sink too.I love that it all took place in one setting as well. The apartment. That's hard to do and just a reflection of how powerful a film it was. And the opening sequence when it showed the black screen for him as the professor was super creative and effective.Great great film and I hope it wins some Oscars. Brendan should definitely win one, but I hear there's some controversy so maybe he won't. Otherwise, I would place a bet on him.",
  "How we mute our own light.": "I just saw this at a preview screening tonight, New Year's Eve. The central character of Charlie is a gentle, beautiful, intelligent and authentic soul in many ways, an English teacher who extolls the virtues of honesty, objectivity and authenticity to his students, but who is, in my view, devastatingly unable to apply these principles to how he views himself, and those he has lost, nor does he view his own continued existence as sacred, nor as a gift. His inability to move on, and his own self destruction through grief-fuelled addiction, is a powerful and important work of art. How many of us have been broken-hearted at the inability of those we love to see themselves as we see them, in all their beauty? How many of us have lost and idealized those we love, and then have lost ourselves to grief and addiction? This was a film which needed to be made, and needs to be seen. This is also a film about damaged familial relationships, and how these shape the people our children become. Amazing, the writer, director and cast deserve everything coming their way, and I am really glad to see Mr. Fraser's return to the public domain with this incredible comeback performance.",
  "Hard to Watch; Great Performance - The Whale": "Make no mistake; this film is difficult to view from a few different perspectives. First, Brandon Fraser is morbidly obese, and is obviously suffering horrendous effects from this condition. It is hard to watch a man suffer for 90 minutes. The film was reminiscent of \"Elephant Man\", another high-quality film about a highly deformed man starring John Hurt. A third great film that was difficult to view was \"My Left Foot\", which featured a character played by Daniel Day-Lewis (who won the Oscar for that role that year).The film is also emotionally depressing in several sections, and the gorging scenes are so horrifying, they make the average horror movie look like a cartoon in comparison. If you ever needed a movie to help you go on a healthier diet, then this film is for you. The other Academy Award (in addition to the LOCK that is Brandon Fraser's Actor in a Leading Role Oscar) this film should win hands down is Makeup; I cannot imagine a film (other than Avatar) that has a chance in this category. The performance of Fraser is breathtaking, and one supporting actress, Ms Jung, gives an outstanding performance as well. You must see this film; it will inspire you.",
  "Selfish man before and after he got Fat": "All the hype about the \"courageous\" man is bunk.He is a man who left his wife and daughter for another man. Then after his partner passes he falls into a depression. He proceeded to eat himself to the brink of death. Once he knows his time is extremely limited, only then does he make an effort to \"reconnect \" with his daughter. Telling her he thought they could spend time together and get to know each other, he gives her the false hope of a future relationship knowing he's got days to live. Despite being repeatedly begged to get medical help Charlie refuses to help himself while drawing his teenage daughter who already has serious abandonment issues, back into his life. Only to abandon her AGAIN.",
  "You go see it because of Fraser": "This movie was so good. It was touching, deep, the acting from everyone is very good and it never looses your interest.Its not like we havent seen any of these story beats before, its not like this is breaking new ground in terms of originality, its not like it was a movie that switched directions every now and then. The story is predictable and not complex at all. Fraser's performance is what makes it engaging tho, who cares if this isnt the most original story as long as there's that performance to carry it. Maybe its just because I personally have lived with obesity but watching him was so engaging and heart wrenching at times. I never wanted to look away for the entire runtime.You wont be dissapointed. This is marvelous movie.",
  "Call me Sheesh!-mael": "It's hard not to walk into this film with a certain bias. Film snobs will often garner the accusation \"You went in wanting to hate it\", while here, we might start hearing the phrase \"You went in wanting to love it\".Indeed, there's been some preemptive celebration of The Whale, not the least of which concerns Brendan Fraser in his first major role in many years. People argue that the press and buzz around the film seem condescending, intermittently treating Fraser like a wounded animal, acting like he hasn't found work whatsoever since his Mummy heyday (he's been a regular on Doom Patrol for years), and continually bringing up all the difficult stuff he's been through since his career height when he'd probably rather just move on and begin anew. (There's also the issue of how his character in The Whale is framed, but we'll get to that.)However, the standing ovation directed at The Whale and then Fraser himself at Vancouver Film Festival was unmistakeable. This isn't about nostalgic fanboyism and coddling; it's a celebration of great cinema and a great actor, known for his 90s crowd-pleasers, making a triumphant comeback by showing his full range in a more serious, artful, frankly devastating work -- if also a bit cheesy at parts. And who else to achieve this than Darren Aronofsky?A critic I follow avidly put it best when he called Aronofsky the most \"expressive\" director working today. When you've seen one of his films, you're going to distinctly remember sounds, images, line deliveries, and bits of music from within it. That said, his tale of the obese, self-loathing English teacher Charlie (Fraser), his laboriously supportive home nurse (Hong Chau), and his estranged daughter (Sadie Sink) has still been a bit disappointing to some.Depressing? You betcha. More than most Aronofsky pictures, in fact. But for a lot of viewers, it fails to \"strike\" the way other Aronofsky films do -- save for the ending, which is indeed a dreamlike experience (with a blinding light that seems right out of The Fountain). It doesn't help that the visual style is dim and drab, even if this arguably accentuates the claustrophobic feel.There's also some controversy, or at the very least some irate discourse, surrounding this character and the stuff we see him do. Critics wonder: Is this a sad tale meant to tug at our heartstrings, or a freakshow display where we're meant to walk away feeling happy that, no matter how bad our lives have gotten, we're not this guy?Indeed, just what does this movie say about Charlie (and, by alleged extension, fat people)? My personal answer is a question: Does it need to be saying anything at all? Could it simply be telling the story of this man's life, and then the rest is in the eye of the beholder? For me, this was more an exploration of a mindset that I'm all too familiar with; a sort of self-hatred and addiction where you're not really addicted to the vices themselves, but to the destruction and misery they bring and the identity that's formed around it.This is Charlie's story, not all fat people's story. I give you that there's a lot of misinformation about fat people; that the problems they face aren't strictly a result of self-destructive behavior. I give you that it's fatphobic to go \"that's your problem\" when fat people can't wear and use certain things. I give you that clothes, chairs, cars, entrances, et al. Are \"skinny-normative\" or whatever and that there's more we can do. I don't think I draw the line at an unreasonable place. When a person is too heavy to walk, that's gravity, not society -- and when they choose not to do anything about it, that is, again, the story of Charlie.I'm also with you that being fat doesn't mean you binge-eat/over-eat and over-eating doesn't mean you're fat (Lord knows my diet should've done SOMETHING to me by now if that were true). Is that what the film is saying? Not any more than it's saying being fat makes you look at porn and neglect your children for a cute boy. I will agree that it might've been \"braver\" of the film to cast an actual obese man instead of going the Norbit route, which surely would've made it feel like less of a joke at fat men's expense to people. Still, we might've then had to endure some sort of \"Why did you fire Brendan Fraser\" outrage.People are going to have their Hot Takes, no matter what -- contrarianism will always be \"cool\" and it's especially fun to do with films that tick just the right number of boxes to net the labels \"Oscar Bait\", \"melodrama\", \"exploitation\", \"offensive\", et cetera. So let's have the Hot Take-makers have their Takes amongst themselves so that those of us who simply like it when films are well-made can enjoy this well-made movie.",
  "Phenomenal. A masterpiece.": "This movie is absolutely phenomenal. I was thinking about it for days after seeing it. It's very moving and an absolute tear jerker.I would say to anyone who watches please definitely don't judge a book by its cover and please watch it. It's a masterpiece.It's my hope that it really gets all the recognition and attention and awards it deserves. Best adaptation, best film and best actor is just some of the nominations I expect during award season. I also anticipate a best supporting actor nomination too. I suspect a best director nod may be there also.I really hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.",
  "Quite good...": "I finally had the opportunity to sit down and watch \"The Whale\", and I was definitely intrigued about this movie since it had gotten so much praise.Writer Samuel D. Hunter did churn out a script that had a very nice storyline, and it was definitely a very nicely character-driven storyline. I have to say that I enjoyed this movie, not only for its storyline, but most certainly also because of some powerful performances by the cast.The issues that the movie deals with fall within the drama aspect for sure, and there is actually several layers to the storyline. And as such, then I think that director Darren Aronofsky does manage to reach out to a wider audience with this movie. And \"The Whale\" is definitely a movie that you should take the time to sit down and watch if you enjoy a properly written drama, since it has aspects that we can relate to quite easily I think.What really works for \"The Whale\" is an astonishing performance by lead actor Brendan Fraser in some seriously heavy, no pun intended, prosthetic make-up to make him morbidly obese. It looks realistic and his performance really is one that hits home hard and sinks in. I was also impressed with the performance of Hong Chau, playing Liz. I wasn't familiar with her prior to this movie, but she really shines on the screen in this movie from director Darren Aronofsky.\"The Whale\" is a movie with a relative small cast ensemble, but they have good actors and actresses on the cast list, so it serves the movie quite well.Visually then I was really impressed with what they did here with this movie. The body prosthetics really looked realistic, and it made it look and feel like the Charlie character was actually that size and his struggles seemed realistic as well. If this had been less than adequate, then the movie wouldn't have worked out quite as well.I was genuinely entertained by \"The Whale\", and it is definitely a movie that I warmly recommend you to take 117 minutes to sit down and watch, because it is quite worth it. \"The Whale\" is a very heartfelt and lingering movie that will stick with you for some time. However, I doubt that I will ever return to watch it a second time, as it just doesn't really seem to be able to support more than a single viewing.My rating of \"The Whale\" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",
  "Not good!": "This movie is just a movie with an agenda and offers nothing outside the usual Hollywood BS. Everything in this movie is exaggerated especially the daughter Ellie. Why is it that in American movies teenagers are always portrayed as evil? I raised 2 teenagers and my son played soccer so we had a significant number of teenagers around us for years, we went to their homes and became friends with their families, I've never encountered a teenager who is as rude and mean as they are portrayed in movies and TV shows. I know the mean ones exist but that doesn't make it the norm. Fortunately they are a tiny minority.The main character Charlie, of course is gay because according to Hollywood, everyone in the world is gay now. But at the same time that same character was married and had a daughter. Which is it? You make a movie about a father and his daughter so why force the gay thing into this again. That shows how bent Hollywood is on forcing their agendas onto everyone. I'm so happy I collect movies and tv shows I can go back to because soon there won't be anything left to watch that doesn't try to brainwash all of us.Anyway, I didn't keep watching this farce. I gave it 2 stars for Brendan Fraser's awesome performance.",
  "So much bigger than a whale": "Although this movie had been out for quite some time, I was curious about watching it but not too intrigued. I then heard the morning DJ give it an amazing review and being the follower that I am I decided to watch it, and I'm so glad I did. Although this is not an action movie or suspensful in any way, this movie manages to capture your attention by the acting alone. No matter what gripes or discriminations you may have about this movie: that he's gay, that he's fat, that he abandoned his daughter, yes, he's as imperfect as they come and his benignness may be as false as we may want to believe it is, yet the protagonist portrays the emptiness that many of us feel, that no matter how much we feed that emptiness, be it by food, sex, drinking, smoking or whatever we use to feed that emptiness, many of us just can't fill it. Many of us just keep going to a point of destruction, to a point where nothing fits anymore, and just like the protagonist we purge it all out at some point. Brendan Frasier and Darren Aronofsky truly do what only a few actors and directors can manage to do in our world of short attention spans and tictoc. They manage to make us look, they manage to hold our attention long enough to care about the pain at least one of the actors carry. No matter who you're looking at, all these characters carry pain, and some don't want to care because caring means holding on to more pain. Brendan Frasier was truly amazing in this role and so were all the supporting actors and actresses. I do recommend this movie at least to see if you can recognize your own whale.",
  "the greatness of Brendan Frasier": "Being myself teacher, working, in pandemic a lot in online, knowing the feelings about a young beloved other, not being thin or so straight, I can be only profound subjective about this film. I do not know the play insping it , but I appreciate the flavours of American theater of XX century recognized in many scenes and in the essence of story.So, I see this film as a portrait very closed by me, not ignoring the melodramatic accents and very simple traits, the fist of cliches and stereotypes and the try to explore, unfortunatelly in shy manner- so supperficial, the food addiction as form of premeditate suicide.But the film has an obvious virtue. A log time, I saw Brendan Frasier with a kind of indulgence. Charlie is the role of his career, one of impressive roles who, like the last , heroic gesture of his character, has the proof of admirable art.",
  "A Matter of Interpretation": "Aronofsky has always dealt primarily with the theme of obsession taken to the extreme, to the point that it deteriorates or even ends the protagonist's life. His formula is:Act I. Establishing the Obsession\nAct II. The Transformation Into a Deep Obsession\nAct III. In Full Obsession Mode, Life Withers or EndsIn Pi, the obsession was understanding the nature of the universe; in Requiem for a Dream it was drugs; in The Fountain it was immortality; in The Wrestler it was wrestling; in Black Swan it was ballet; in Noah it was devotion to God; and in Mother! It was building and maintaining her house.But this time around we have skipped straight into the end of Act III. We open with cardiac arrest immediately, establishing that his life is ending imminently. But does this mean the formula is broken? Not entirely. The acts are still there; they just happened in the past relative to the story's present setting. Therefore it falls on the viewer to interpret everything.In fact, interpretation is the central theme of this entire film. The very first dialogue is the reading of an essay which contains a very interesting interpretation on Moby Dick, even going as far as to interpret something about the author's very own life. We then see how the protagonist interprets the essay (which is itself an interpretation of something else) and applies it to his own life, showing that interpretation works on many layers. Not to mention he is also an English teacher online, who teaches interpretation of various literature and applying it to one's own life, as he's all about honesty and authenticity.When Thomas reads a biblical passage, he interprets this and applies it not only to Charlie's life but also his own. Heck, even the pizza delivery guy must have formed his own interpretation of what Charlie looks like, until finally curiosity gets the better of him. This is in fact why it bothered Charlie so much; it wasn't just that the guy physically saw him and violated his privacy. But even more importantly: as an idealist and optimist he vastly prefers when people use their imaginations and form interpretations of something, over getting bitten by cynical cold hard reality which stamps out the infinite possibility of interpretation. This is also why he keeps his webcam off during teaching.This was a major polar difference between him and his ex-wife: he even tells her \"You've always been a cynic\", implying that he is the opposite. She interprets her own daughter as Satan (\"she's evil\"), whereas he interprets her as Christ (\"amazing person\"). On the surface her actions do seem very evil, but he interprets them all as salvation, as evidenced by what she did to Thomas ending up as a net positive for him (in his interpretation).This balancing of two extreme polar opposites is another major theme: he explicitly calls it out as such when he tells his ex he \"needs to balance her cynicism out\". But also take note that he is balancing his partner's past anorexia through overeating -- or was the partner balancing his overeating with anorexia? A bit of both most likely.On top of it all, Aronofsky and the playwright Samuel D. Hunter not only celebrate the power of artistic intepretation and how it affects our lives deeply, but in so doing also invite us to interpret their creation as well. Is it a biblical story of Jonah and the Whale, is the whole thing a Moby Dick metaphor, or is he just a literally fat \"whale\"? Is the daughter Satan or Christ, is she the whale (she never forgets anything and whales are known to have impeccable memory), or is she just a lost girl from a broken family? It's a matter of interpretation.",
  "Trying to save us from his own sad story, just for a little while": "Overweight Charlie(Brendan Fraser, amazing) doesn't usually interact with people, other than his best friend the nurse Liz(Hong Chau, so full of heart) who takes care of him since he doesn't have health insurance, but when he gets some bad news he decides he's going to try to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter, Ellie(Sadie Sink, doing her best to be credible as a character frequently cartoonishly evil).This has sort of the minimal cast and single location of mother!, with the realism of The Wrestler. It is not filmed the same, rather, it's very claustrophobic. This man is in a prison of his own making. The exploration of grief is deeply compelling, including things like the way it can lead to the forming of unusual bonds, the push-pull of sometimes being in denial, at other times, confronting head-on that the person you lost is never coming back.As a Darren Aronofsky film, it is of course full of misery, and deeply unsubtle. It also frames the lead as an object of shock, which is an issue for a story that is seeking to inspire empathy. He may not have been the right director for this, though he does still do a great job. The movie gets across how tedious and hopeless his life is without being boring to watch.This features very brief sexuality, a little drug content, and a lot of strong language(some of it very homophobic, used to illustrate, not endorse). I recommend this to every fan of those involved in making it. 8/10.",
  "Why was I unemotional?": "The eponymous whale played by a brilliant Brendan Fraser is a curiously frustrating film. I'm by no means unemotional when it comes to watching films. I've cried buckets at loads of films recently, from Mrs Harris goes to Paris (yes, honest), to Till (no surprise there) and back to The Last Bus. But I cry when I'm moved. I cry when I'm angry. I cry when I'm happy. I don't cry when I feel I've been manipulated to cry. I found The Whale surprisingly unemotional. With this being Darron Aromovsky I expected the film to earn its wow factor. There was no wow factor. All a bit too much in your face - \"you should cry now!\". Didn't work for me. I like to feel emotional on my own terms.I'm its defence, we know the main character is obese. And when we first see him naked coming out of the shower, I thought to myself - oh so obvious - his meat and two veg are hidden by his ubiquitous flesh. But there was a point to this. He had lost his loving partner, and, as he tearfully tells his daughter, he used to be thin and he used to make love every day. When he lost the love of his life, there was no longer any need for his meat and two veg and, whilst others might take drugs or alcohol, his chosen means of meeting his maker was through food addiction. Hide the means of love. I get all that. But for reasons I can't explain, it all felt a little, erm, thin. 6 out of ten.",
  "Absolute beauty of a performance": "This is most definitely Brendan Fraisers best performance since with honors and school ties. This film shows how beautiful films were once upon a tome made. Great acting and Brendan puts his all in on this. As if he was doing the last film of his career. If he doesn't win every award possible then I have zero hope for humanity and especially hollywood. Thank you so much to Mr. Fraiser for them gem of a movie. This is most definitely Brendan Fraisers best performance since with honors and school ties.

  "Who would want me to be part of their life?.....": "Charlie is a morbidly obese online English teacher suffering with congestive heart failure. Knowing his time is limited, he refuses his caregiver, and friends demand that he go to a hospital, choosing instead to spend his remaining time trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter.....Aronofsky is a really difficult director to digest at times. He can make wonderful, often whimsical films such as The Fountain. And then he can make films that leave you depressed and exasperated, such as the rest of the films he has made. The Whale fall into the latter, and then some.From the opening scenes, you know that thus film isn't going to be an easy ride for anyone watching this. The 4:3 aspect ratio making us feel just as claustrophobic and trapped as Charlie is. Both metaphorical and literally for Charlie. Here is a man who literally has a lot on his mind. To say he's let himself go a bit is an understatement, and Fraser is amazing in what has to be his most difficult role ever.Even though Charlie is a wonderful human being, and the audience shows him great empathy, you cannot help but stare at his character throughout the film in disgust, much like John Doe did to Gluttony in Se7en. And Charlie does very little to help himself. We see him gorge on all of the worse foods known to man. And where Favreaus Chef made you yearn for food, don't have dinner reservations after seeing this. I guarantee you won't want to eat after seeing this.The weather plays an important part of the films narrative. The moment we meet Charlie, there is heavy rainfall, and as the film progresses, the weather becomes more settled, clearer, the more Charlie's condition worsens.The rest of the cast are great, but are mostly abhorrent characters with very little redeeming features about them.I'm glad I've seen the film, it's very good. But I have no intention of seeing it again. It's bleak, claustrophobic, depressing, and very upsetting. I live with BPD, and I was down for a long time after this film finished.",
  "Dark painful film about addiction and last chance.": "If you have watched Darren Aronofsky films like \"Black Swan\" and \"The Wrestler\" you know that they are dark and grim showing how life and human condition is sad and on the outskirts of last chance for change. And with his latest \"The Whale\" it is a showcase of a hermit and reclusive shut in morbidly overweight man in Charlie(Brendan Fraser) who aside from teaching online college English literature passes his time watching gay porn(to feed his love of the same sex). However his biggest obsession and addiction is food from feasting and loading up on chicken, subs, and candy bars and soda he seems lost with no meaning to live. As this film is a cautionary tale and take that those overweight should see as viewing Charlie shows how being big takes a toll on the body and one's health. Thru all of the sad personal drama his only life line is an in call Nurse Liz(Hong Chau) who's fight to keep Charlie ticking is a drama filled drain and in an emotional wild card subplot in the reconnection with Charlie's estranged brash ,bold, and stubborn go against the grain daughter Ellie the film has tense moody moments. As thru love and reconnection while visiting old wounds and skeletons Charlie comes to realize a shining light of hope as he tutors Ellie finally memories of love comes back and most important a truthful light is shined on both. This film is painful and blunt to watch as we the viewer see the personal crisis of one Charlie, still it's an emotional connection of hope and love, as he sees this thru essays, literature, and Ellie.",
  "A depressing film": "I didn't found any bug in the plot, it is well made. But is not that astonishing as I expected to be. The most enjoyable thing is the acting of Brendan Fraser.The movie starts with Fraser watching gay porn and jerking off. I didn't understand the necessity of that scene, but well.The movie in general is depressing and always dramatic, although I liked the message about saying the right thing and being honest with oneself.This movie is not that good as Requiem For A Dream or Pi, but is not a bad film. The atmosphere, the drama, the actings are all good. But personally I would have expected more.",
  "Poorly done": "I don't understand the positive reviews. The writing in this film is cliched. I find it annoying at the least that Hollywood rewards mediocrity simply because the topic is interesting/somewhat salacious. That isnt enough. I'm surprised at Aronofsy's choice to direct this film given his excellent body of work prior. He didn't pick up on the lackluster script? Surprising to say the least. One of the glaring problems in this screenplay is that it doesn't translate well from the stage. There's no revelations here either. I would venture to guess the stageplay is equally bad. We learn absolutely nothing about his (Fraser's character's) horrible existence other than he's miserable. I find it lazy on the part of the writer and producers who think this is a meaningful work. Lastly, Brendan Fraser overacted. He is a superb actor working with bad material. And was poorly directed which added to a lackluster performance. Not worthy of any accolades.",
  "Modest yet brilliant, with a genius screenplay and simply sensational lead performance": "All involved in fine character drama \"The Whale\" deserve credit but two REALLY stand out: debut writer Samuel D Hunter whose insightful screenplay (based on his play) cleverly parallels the novel 'Moby Dick'; & Brendan Fraser who's simply sensational as a dying, morbidly obsese, online lecturer. It's based entirely within Fraser's simple Idaho apartment, with just four characters (and a pizza guy) visiting him: friend (& nurse) Hong Chau; estranged (& angrily troubled) teen daughter Sadie Sink; missionary teen Ty Simpkins; & ex-wife Samantha Morten. All are great, under director Darren Aronofsky, but Hunter & Fraser are something else. Modest yet brilliant cinema.",
  "Incredible Performance!": "First off you don't go to see The Whale, you go to see experience Brendan Fraser's greatest performance to date.The film's plot is a very basic one in which a heartbreakingly house-bound morbidly obese man tries to reconnect with his daughter. What I didn't go into this film expecting was just how simultaneously heartbreaking, powerful, and influential a performance Brendan Fraser was going to give.This film broke me multiple times, in the theater, into watery eyes and down right tears at times. If you see this movie and don't get teary eyed, you're not human. Hong Chau and Sadie Sink also give great performances that supplement Charlie's story in ways I wasn't expecting.Overall, Brendan Fraser deserves the Oscar for Best Actor for this film, with at least a nomination for Hong Chau for Best Supporting Actress, it was an incredibly powerful, heartbreaking, and ineffable story of how everyone needs someone, and with that begs a question, without someone who do we become?",
  "Movie 6/10 Fraser 10/10": "The movie as a whole is lacking. Fraser's performance is impeccable. His range as an actor is amazing. He will make you laugh in Blast From the Past and cry in The Whale, all the while playing characters that you will buy into because of his acting skills. He deserves all the awards for this performance.The movie itself trues too hard. Someone couldn't help putting their political views in, and it's distracting. Some of the scenes were supposed to be symbolic (I think), but I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be getting from them.There are solid performances by several. I think the editing could have been better. I need to watch a comedy now.",
  "Great performances in a problematic film.": "Saw The Whale last night. Let me say first that Aronofsky makes VERY problematic movies. But that's his point. He wants to provoke conversation. From the focus on the self-destructive intent of this particular obese person, to the misuses of religion, to the anger and bitterness that stems from broken and deceitful marriages, this was very uncomfortable to watch.But damn the man can pull incredible performances out of his actors. BEST performance by an actor of the year, I don't care what the detractors say, bar none. And I'm not a Brendan Frazier fan. And Hong Chau had herself quite a year. Suitably intense and menacing in the Menu, here she was stern in her doling out of tough love but also displaying an OMG level of vulnerability. She probably won't win this year (this is another \"year of the actress\") but she has my vote for best supporting actress this year. Even the peripheral players were amazing, from Frazier's estranged ex-wife and daughter (the legendary Samantha Morton - you have to see her in the Serpent Queen - and Sadie Sink) to the missionary who tries to \"save\" Frazier's characte, and even the literally two second, non-verbal interaction between Grazier and the Pizza Guy.Problematic as it is, I would highly recommend it. If you can see it in the theater, please do. I fear many of the subtleties of the performances will be lost on a smaller screen.",
  "Fraser earned all of the 6 stars": "I bought into the hype from media and other sources that this was an amazing film. I cleared my mind and allowed myself to go wherever this film takes me. 20 minutes into the film and I was drained of interest.I tried to summarize the plot and after 2 tries I gave up. Instead I'll just say this was a solid performance by Brendan Fraser in a fat suit or CGI.The Charlie character was good but the supporting cast didn't do him or the movie any favors. From the nurse to the daughter to Thomas, they were all crucial pieces to Charlie's story but their performances were beyond annoying. Each character's story-line ate away at any importance I placed on Charlie. When the movie ends I just didn't care much like the characters themselves.This movie is pre-ordained an Oscar Winner already so I will consider myself too dumb to understand its relevance. Sorry but it was not a convincing movie and the acting was meh.",
  "Robert D. Nero won the coveted \"Best Actor\" . . .": ". . . gelded statuette for gaining a measly 60 pounds to shoot RAGING BULL, so B. Fraser should be a lock to triumph in that category this March, as he tacked on at least 900 pounds to embody THE WHALE. This Passion Play covers Fraser's husky Charlie during his Holy Week, as he engages everyone he knows in theological debates, mostly about MOE BEE D-Word. This film zeroes in on the B-word that rhymes with \"rubber.\" A single blue whale may yield 50 tons of this Charlie--bigger-than-a-tuna substance, which equates to one tenth of a million pounds. This picture suggests that buckets of fried chicken, drawers full of Three Musketeers candy bars, a half dozen pizzas, gallons of Pepsi and many feet of submarine sandwiches should be consumed daily by anyone interested in emulating Fraser's success at bulking up.",
  "The weight of a movie that could have been more": "Given the premises and the excellent performance by a redeemed Brendan Fraser, this movie had a lot of potential that often tended to vanish thanks to a script full of limits. Contrary to what we saw in The Wrestler, here Aronofsky wants to please the wide public with an abuse of drama cliches and \"ad hoc\" scenes that forces the viewer to feel emotional. This resulted in an increasing sense of artificiality that reaches its peak toward the end. Overall, a good (albeit imperfect) movie that could have been elevated by a more realistic representation of the father-daughter relationship and, in particular, on a higher directing presence by Aronofsky, whose technical abilities has never been so hidden and standardised as in this film.",
  "Once in a decade performance": "This film is so much more than the revival of Brendan Fraser's mesmerizing return to cinema. Touching on several themes in a way we're not quite used to seeing, with a different perspective on compassion and human empathy, this stage play adapted for the screen is a once in a decade achievement. What we're seeing here is a director collaborating with actors, a DOP, special effects crew and composer who have all managed to sync up with the elusive. A demonstration of collaborative perfection.Aronofsky is a master at replicating addiction, nightmares, and human suffering. There is nothing worse than witnessing the self destruction of a human being, and Aronofsky and Fraser's eyes will take you there for better or worse.10/10 but you lose a point for breaking my heart.",
  "Brendan Gonna Scoop Up That Oscar Like Ice Cream": "For the past 10 years, one of my childhood friends and I have been wanting for Brendan Fraser comeback. Long before Keanu had his comeback with the 'John Wick' movies, and even before Matthew McConaughey's comeback with 'Lincoln Lawyer', 'Dallas Buyers' and 'Mud', my friend and I knew Brendan was great and that movies are missing his presence.FINALLY, in 2022, Darren Aranofsky gives us a character that allows Brendan to show off all his acting skills and release all that pent-up emotion he's had for the past many years. What Brendan gives us in 'The Whale' is his best performance to date, and easily the best performance of the year. Brendan deserves all the love and praise he's getting for this movie. Sadie Sink also should get a nomination for Supporting Actress since she killed it as well. I'm happy that a teen/child isn't portrayed like an obnoxious pos TikToker and is actually relatable and real.That being said, I found the actual movie and story pretty lackluster. You can feel that this movie is based off a play just by it's pacing and constrictiveness. It's slow, takes place in one room, half the characters' motives and dialogue are just not fully fleshed out. The nurse and missionary both give pretty wooden performances as well. The ending felt way too abrupt and should've had different direction to leave more of an impact.Overall, 'The Whale' is an average film carried by dynamite performances, especially from Mr. Fraser.6.3/10.",
  "Awful except for Fraser": "My partner said if I took her to see this when we were dating she would have left me. We left the movie laughing at how bad it was while others walked by crying. I cried at sex and the city, but not at this. Fraser plays the lead role very well but everything else about the movie was disappointing. His nurse is good although the flawed storyline and awful ending just left me wishing I hadn't wasted my time. The alternative was the new magic Mike film amd I regretted not seeing that instead. That's how bad this was.The daughters script wasn't good and the preacher kid role a total waste of space albeit played well, just had no bearing on things.",
  "Not": "Much to say , except , that it is a brilliance of this director and actors, who made 2 hours gone unnoticed , while the story was shown only in one room with only couple of actors and no other action whatsoever! It is not easy to achieve , so KUDOS!On the other hand , It is definitely , for me , one of the weaker films of Aronofsky , kind of like a little underdeveloped cousin to the great \"Wrestler\" .Anyhow , definitely ,a brilliant one time watch.600???(((\nMuch to say , except , that it is a brilliance of this director and actors, who made 2 hours gone unnoticed , while the story was shown only in one room with only couple of actors and no other action whatsoever!

  "A tremendous character piece that is an absolute must see": "The Whale (2022) is a movie that my wife and I watched in theaters last night. The storyline follows an obese man who feels guilty about his past. He is divorced and has a daughter he has little to no relationship with and he had a lover who has died and ultimately led to his divorce. He sees death as his only logical next step but has some loose ends he wants to tie up before dying.This movie is directed by Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream) and stars Brendan Fraser (The Mummy), Sadie Sink (Stranger Things), Hong Chau (Watchmen), Samantha Morton (Minority Report) and Ty Simpkins (Jurassic World).There is so much to like about this movie. The fine details in the writing and depiction of living obese is really well captured. There's some very smart subplots in this on religion, divorce, sexuality, self destructiveness and selfishness without knowing it. The acting in this is out of this world by everyone, but especially Fraser who delivers a career best performance. His ability to deliver both his character, sorrow and subtle determination was impressive. Chau and Morton deliver fantastic supporting characters. It's impossible to not be frustrated with Morton's character. The storyline is well\npaced and the reveals happen methodically but appropriately as the storyline unfolds. The irony of the ending was perfect.Overall, this is a tremendous character piece that is an absolute must see. I would score this an 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",
  "Tear Jerker that doesn't fake it to make it": "The subject matter of the film is enough to test the mettle of the acting in the film, which rarely falls short, only to some corny lines here and there. The return of Brendan Fraser is more than welcome when you consider what his Hollywood hiatus life put him through. Showing his dramatic prowess in this film when we are used to seeing him in silly comedies is very refreshing. Half of my personal emotional response to the film is the fact that we do not deserve Brendan back in any capacity after all he's gone though and I'm so ecstatic that he's been embraced so lovingly. (I'd love to meet this legend one day just to pick his brain) The cinematography and directing is simple and is almost paced and blocked like a play (which The Whale is adapted from,) with only a couple of set changes, which keeps it simple in its native 4:3 aspect ratio. It's easy enough to push out a tear jerker. What's harder is to hit several sensitive and existential topics that humans deal with on a daily basis, and The Whale does so, causally and beautifully. These topics including religion, sexual identity, self hatred, belief in humanity's capability, life long regret, family separation and estrangement, parenting styles, body dysmorphia, self harm, emotional codependency, failing education systems, and of course the plight of death and existential dread. Each character has a small individual arc that all play into each others'.SPOILER-\nThe most emotionally intense part of this entire film, for me, was the way they came full circle with the \"essay\" Charlie recited every time he had a health attack, kind of grounding himself, only for it to be revealed that it was his daughter's middle school essay the entire time. As a father who constantly worries he's failing as a single parent, I empathized so much with wanting to let her know whole heartedly that after he's gone, he wants her to know her significance to his life and to everyone she affects. Truly incredible film.",
  "Intense and emotive": "This movie is Brendan Fraser's achievement.His performance is strong and moving.The story is about depression and redemption, and it's very sad and intense.Knowing that Fraser himself have struggled with depression makes it harder for me at least, and makes me empathise with the main character. It really brought me to tears several times through the movie.The technical aspect is very good, cinematography, direction, and the supporting actors are very solid.It's a movie to watch when feeling strong, as it's not a happy watch, but it really deserves to have it's moment in your time.Great movie, I hope Fraser gets more dramatic roles, he's done great in this one.",
  "Just A Nobody's Opinion": "It's hard to see how anyone could watch this and not be enthralled with the performance that Brendan Fraser gives. He has, IMO, always been a masterful actor that has not been given the credit he truly deserves.In this we see Brendan go through such a range of emotions it is hard to look away. Its hard to not feel both critical and empathetic for \"Charlie\" because he shows that he feels that way for himself. \"Liz\" also feels both angry and lovingly towards him but is compelled by her empathy and the love she carries for her deceased brother \"Alan\", to continue to be there for \"Charlie\".\"Charlie's\" desire to feel that he did something right by \"Ellie\" is something I think that most people can recognize. Her attitude and anger are deeper than normal teenage angst but she can not allow herself to reveal or come to terms with the fact that it is ok to love her Dad despite how he might have wronged her. She also has a caring heart that she tries to conceal but eventually shows through her interactions with \"Thomas\".The film is well crafted and while it doesn't elaborate on some of the finer details, enough is there to warrant an understanding of the characters and what they represent. It is a slow film but it opens itself in a consistent manner that keeps your attention.It is quite a drama and an excellent portrayal of Fraser's skill. He was nothing short of impressive in this role. So glad to see him making a comeback. Can't wait to see what the future holds for him.",
  "Near perfect despite a bit tough to watch": "THE WHALE is probably the most talked movie of all the ones that are nominated for Academy Awards, and it's also the resurgence of the career of Brendan Fraser, and I seriously hope he wins the Academy Award since he was considered a failed actor despite some great titles in his career. As I saw it in theater with my best friend, we both found it powerful and surprising considering the movies for which Fraser is famous (THE MUMMY trilogy, LOONEY TUNES BACK IN ACTION, FURRY VENGEANCE and some others).Charlie (Fraser) is an obese English teacher that during his online classes keeps the laptop camera switched off because he's afraid of showing his appearence to students. He lives a monotonous lifestyle: he is visited by nurse Liz (Hong Chao) that recommends him to go to check himself for health issues since he is at risk of congestive heart failure, but Charlie refuses because he doesn't want to spend so much money on exams and visits. Every evening he eats a double pizza, and until half of the movie he doesn't sees in face the pizza boy, letting him simply leave the pizzas in the porch and take Charlie's money from the mail box. Charlie wants to reconnect with his daughter that hasn't seen for 8 years: she comes and of course things go awry. Soon we find out why Charlie became obese: he tried to kill himself after the death of his partner for which he left his wife, and feels a huge sense of guilt. As the meetings with his daughter continue, they gradually patch things up until the heart-wrenching ending.If you watch this movie expecting it to be full of action or a comedy, go somewhere else. This is one of those movies where the acting is the most important thing: Fraser did all his best for playing the part of a man that wants to kill himself but as he approaches death he feels the need of patching things up with his daughter because she might be the confirmation that he did at least one thing right in his life (my favourite quote of the movie, and I relate to it when I thing of the crazy things I have done lately). The supporting characters are all great, especially the daughter, and the ending is mind-bending because the heart-attack that kills Charlie is shown with a immense bright light that fulls the screen before the final shot of Charlie and the daughter on the beach when he was still in shape.Overall, a story of redemption for both the character and the lead actor's career and incredibly touching and full of hope as well. If you have a chance of living nearby some theater that still airs it, go to see it at all costs. And I dare to say it... go Fraser! You deserve to win the Academy Award after all the bad things they did to you in the past.",
  "An exploration of addiction and homosexuality.": "A film about addiction, the causes of which are: loss of or a lack of connection to others. I can't disagree with that assessment.I wasn't quite convinced by the character of Charlie. He seemed like such a grotesque figure of pity to the point of caricature. What I did like about the film is that it tackled the subject of gay men and the churches attempt to call their love 'sins of the flesh'. That somehow being gay is some kind of sinful addiction akin to food or drugs. The film seems to float this as a possible interpretation but thankfully clearly and unequivocally denounces such an interpretation to the point where it is wholly in favour of same sex attracted love.The acting was great across the board. Strangely I thought Brendan Fraser had the least best performance of anyone. Sadie Sink, Samantha Morton but especially Hong Chau are brilliant. Brendan Fraser's performance is good but nothing to write home about. Is he being praised more for his physical acting? Perhaps I need to watch the film again to full appreciate it.The actually watching of the film itself is slightly uncomfortable and not overly enjoyable. It was afterwards when I thought a bit more about that film that I felt I appreciated it more. Charlie's character is a bit manipulative and unsubtle as a symbol of addiction but Aronofsky gets his point across. As a man of ideas and symbols Aronofsky can't be beaten, but I'm not sure I could believe in Charlie as a character.",
  "A heartbreaking and beautiful film": "The Whale\nDirected by Darren Aronofsky. Written by Samuel HunterIt's so rare that I find myself anticipating a movie. Rare to be counting the days until it is released. Even rarer when presented with the film itself, it becomes something else. This movie had a chaotic schedule for theatrical release. First it was set to come out on December 9th. I started to gain in excitement that much more. This was directly after my birthday and a new Aronofsky movie was coming out. I love his work so much. The Fountain struck me and The Wrestler was new territory for dramatic stories taking professional wrestling in that vein. Aronofsky doesn't shy away from anything.But it didn't come out that weekend. It was only released in New York and LA. I went looking for new information and the date of December 21st appeared. This is nothing new for a drama like this to come out during Christmas time. But it really only added a few theaters, more than 90 miles away from me in the Crescent city. I was frustrated. In this day and age of ease of access, it can become easy to forget what waiting for something can be like.But then something miraculous happened. When I was looking up times that M3gan was playing, I saw that The Whale was playing at the Cinemark in Gulfport. Holy crap. I was elated. I called my wife to tell her and when looking at schedules, it became clear that we might need to wait. What if it left theaters before I could see it. This is when my wife gave me a wonderful gift. She knew how much I needed to see this movie in the theater and she said it was okay for me to go on my own. So I did. And I haven't had an experience like this in a movie theater in a very long time. It left me shaken.I needed to sit through the credits which were not long and then even when the lights came back up, I needed to sit there. I had to take deep breaths. I was drawn into the story and I found myself in that apartment with Charlie. It wanted me to spend time with him and get to know him as a person. Charlie is a recluse. He teaches online English classes but he never turns on his webcam. Charlie is grieving. He lost the love of his life many years ago and now he sits alone in his apartment except when his friend and nurse visits. Charlie weighs 600 pounds and he can barely move without assistance. He is a compulsive eater and this has been his way of coping. It has finally caught up to him when he suffers a heart attack and wants to get his life in order before anything happens particularly with the daughter he left behind.I can not say anything more as the discovery is integral to appreciating what this movie has to offer. It was adapted from a play by the original author. This takes place entirely in that apartment. It has to by necessity of the main character. I have taken this movie to heart in a way that makes me want to argue and dropkick critics who have completely missed the point or missed the humanity present. Too much agenda and not enough empathy. This includes several of what used to be my favorites to listen to.I don't like to compare with what other critics are saying. I know I'm attracted to movies that are more sad in nature. Many of my favorites are gut punches. This is just who I am and what works for me. It doesn't work for many. Hell I could make the case for film critics that it works for none of them.You can become too bogged down in analyzing things from a technical standpoint. You can find yourself down a rabbit hole of story and plot mechanics trying to make the pieces fit in an engineering standpoint. Every Frame a Pause do things in this fashion. You can find yourself feeling defensive because the movie is about an obese man and you yourself fit a similar or less description. I am overweight myself and can absolutely stand to lose pounds and get more healthy than I currently am. The key though is empathy. Connecting with somebody else and seeing the story from their point of view. You can connect it to elements in your own life. Charlie's relationship with his daughter certainly worked for me. When it comes to fathers and their kids, it gets me every time. It does more when those fathers want to be in the children's lives and for some reason or another, they can't.The Whale hit those things for me. I didn't see Charlie as a freak show. I didn't find him grotesque. I found him in mourning and I found him suffering. This doesn't mean I apply to every overweight or obese person on the planet. That's absurd. This was unique to his story alone. He wants to see the good in the world. He looks for that silver lining. That's not me. That's my wife. She sees things in that way and it makes for a beautiful balance between us.Brendan Fraser disappears into this role and also doesn't. How he is as a person is found in Charlie and it brings new things to the story. He is magnetic. He carries this and it is some of the best work he has ever done but he is not alone. Hong Chau is fantastic. She was also tremendous in The Menu and unique and wonderful in Treme. I see nothing but great things for her. Samantha Morton is in one scene and it is downright heartbreaking but beautiful at the soul level. This brings me to Sadie Sink as his daughter. She's angry at the world. She's angry and bitter at her dad. You may want to turn your nose up at her but there are several layers to why she's acting out in the way she is. She is something else. She is playing so much in so little sometimes. Sadie Sink and Brendan Fraser work miracles in this.Darren Aronofsky also knows when to let his actors be in the moment. He knows where the music is appropriate and how it can accentuate what is happening. I hate the idea that just because something is set in one location, that it's somehow bad or stagey. A filmed play that one guy told me when he got drunk enough to be honest about my film Language of the Sick. Human emotions are action. It is the drama.This movie was damn near a masterpiece. It is right up there with Aronofsky's best work and his most human work. I would rank it right alongside The Wrestler and Requiem for a Dream. It is a heartbreaking and beautiful movie. It showed to me that when you surrender yourself to the story and you become entwined with the characters, you live it with them and the theater is the best place to do that. It is not always the most convenient but it does have the least amount of distractions. I want people to discover this movie and ignore the others about it. It is magnificent. I loved this movie. I give it an A.",
  "I usually don't agree with the critics but lacks the deepth": "I think this movie has quite higher rating with the audience rather than with the critics.I usually don't agree with the critics but in this case I don't see why this should be rated more than 6 or 6.5 at best, it's not a bad movie but nothing great also.It's soda pop consumable movie loaded with heavy topic ( no pun intended ) like obesity, god, religion, family, betrayal, and it barely scratches the surface of deeper emotions regarding all of these.It's more like a school drama or a sitcom with one room where actors come for their scene and leave. No real character development.I was hoping this to be more of a bold statement with deep message at the end and not a consumable product with cheesy scenes.",
  "Explaining my rating": "Brendan Fraser is excellent, if he doesn't win the Best Actor Oscar it will be an absolute travesty.But I go to the cinema to enjoy myself. I am not interested in 2 hours of what is effectively a stage play that has been filmed to make a snuff movie about someone slowly killing themselves while their friends and family help them. I am certainly not interested in that being portrayed as some message of hope and happiness.None of the characters are likeable. The only one I have even vague sympathy for is Dan the pizza delivery guy. The excuses given for where they are in their lives are just excuses.",
  "A powerful film": "The Whale is a powerhouse of a film. It will likely take a toll and leave you emotionally drained, but boy is it worth it.Of course, there is the central performance from Brendan Fraser which really is magnificent. He physically and emotionally takes you on the journey of Charlie in a way that only the best actors can. You will feel every emotional dagger that he feels and will be immensely touched by his performance I have no doubt.It's not just about him though, every performance is spot on. Sadie Sink shines in the complex role of Charlie's estranged daughter, and Hong Chau brings such warmth and heart to her role as Charlie's friend and enabler Liz. In a cast on only 5 people all the performances had to be spot on and they really are.The story is deeply emotional and so well thought out. We slowly peel back the layers and uncover more about Charlie, his past, his relationships, and how this has led him to the point he is at. It is a propulsive piece of storytelling that climaxes perfectly.The events of the film are confined to Charlie's apartment, and largely to a single room which really connects you to the character as you experience life through his eyes and a feeling of being trapped.Darren Aronofsky's direction is perfect. The score is terrific. The pacing great.A wonderful, powerful, poignant film.",
  "Loved it": "So happy to see Brendan in movies again. He killed this role. Wow what a movie. Like everyone keeps saying all the actors are very good and very believable. I've seen people in this shape when I was In medical industry. Portraying someone that heavy was perfect. Movie is just too damn good. The apartment it's filmed in is perfect house for someone. This was very well thought and researched movie. Brendan deserves to be in more movies. I can see him win an Oscar. Just watch it, it's pure drama. It's sad, funny, emotional, vile and just a damn good movies. Give this man an Oscar and get him in more movies please.",
  "Dark Aronofsky is the best Aronofsky": "The Whale is Aronofsky at his absolutely best, minimalist, and darkest. He inks out a script from the source content that keeps users engaged, wringing out every ounce of talent possible from his actors, cut and framed into a five day chronicle.Yes, Fraser gives the performance of his life. And consequently, so does Hong Chau give her best, whose supporting work here will likely be overshadowed by Fraser's own. Viewers are so transfixed into Charlie's character that it wasn't until credits roll there's a realization some 99% of screen time is all contained inside one tiny, stagnant apartment.The story itself is one that viewers like myself will grapple with, pondering for days how much intervention into other people's lives we should have, and the merits of doing so. There is little glimmer of hope; an outcome that is neither surprising nor expecting. The Whale is painted in a world of being merely a witness, helpless to those you love.The Whale is absolutely worth the watch, irregardless of its destination or agreement.",
  "Great acting": "The three main characters do an incredible job especially Brenden and the daughter. The story is great. A touching story of a man who just wants his daughter to know her value. Another theme is that we each have our own truth and that truth is the most important thing. The most important thing in life is honesty. I also like how Brendens character is always kind despite the cruelty he experiences. I understand some people don't like this movie because he is in a fat suit. In reality if they cast a real person who is that obese to play the role it would not be healthy because the level of acting required could cause them to hurt their heart. I've lived with someone with a physical body like Brendens character and just like the character this real person became that obese because of depression. I think this movie is important because it shows a truth that exists for some people and maybe having a touching story about it could help some people. Also I've met people like the daughter and the nurse. A lot is grounded in reality in this movie. It really touched me and my friend and not very many movies do that anymore. It's hard to put into words but I think this was the best movie of 2022. Granted I haven't seen TAR yet and I've heard that good too. It's definitely the best movie I've seen this year.",
  "Excellent acting and an okay story.": "I mostly wanted to watch The Whale to see the Oscar nominees acting. The story itself wasn't too appealing to me as I don't have too much sympathy for morbidly obese people. It might sound cruel but I'm not going to apologize for what people do to themselves just because they lack self-discipline and willpower to turn their lives around. Being morbidly obese in a world where 25000 people die of starvation every single day is the ultimate form of egoism in my opinion. So no I will never feel sorry for all the whales on this planet (the human ones), no matter what struggles they have in their lives. That said The Whale is worth watching just to see the brilliant acting, the story itself isn't that exceptional. Brandon Fraser deserves his nomination as did the make-up artists. I really liked Hong Chau as well in this sad story. Sadie Sink is definitely a young actress that will make great movies in the future. I would like to see her in a totally different style for once, not the forever angry adolescent. I get it that this movie touched a lot of people, certainly in America where gluttony and overconsumption is a thing that can't be ignored.",
  "Good enough": "\" The Whale \" is an emotional ride that climaxes in the ending scenes, when the drama hits its highest and the performances get more intense as well.Taking place in the main character's appartment, the movie focuses only on the last week of the main lead's life, as he tries to make ammends and his secrets are revealed as to how he ended up in the situation that he is now in.Soft and emotional, with some more intense moments when the character gave in and went on a craze of devouring everything that he can find in his fridge, the movie has everything, dispite its limited space and time.Highlight of the movie: the performances.",
  "Very low standards": "To be honest I think this movie is getting so hyped because people didn't think Brendan Fraser could act. Is it a career best performance? Maybe but that's not saying much. You do feel empathy for charlie, especially because the characters that surround him are pretty horrendous. No one feels any empathy or sympathy that lead to his condition. I suffer depression and I recognized the depression that lead to the condition charlie is in. Despite whatever mistakes he may have made. He didn't deserve the treatment he got. There's a specific line in the film I related to and burst into tears. That being said, otherwise I'm Not seeing the hype of this movie. Sure, it's not the worst of the year (that honor belongs to banshees) but I'm really honestly not seeing these amazing performances everyone is talking about, unless the purpose was to hate them so much, you wish they were the ones dying.",
  "The Whale Stinks": "We all knew, when this movie got over-hyped and the media went crazy for it, that something is very fishy about this movie. But I thought i will give it a try,....... but there he was, in all its glory. THE WHALE. The whale wants to show his face on the webcam but he doesn't. Also he wants to masturbate to gay porn but he can't. Also something sad about his daughter, and a forced sentimental/paranormal scene at the end. This movie could have actually worked, if it wasn't for the extremely boring, simple, dull, linear and outright DUMB plot. An obese man has to overcome his fears of turning on his webcam, and can not jerk off to gay porn , because the Mormons killed his boyfriend?. Really?.This is what a great movie looks like, the media tells you. Do not believe this, because it's a lie.",
  "Very Good, another masterpiece for Aronofsky": "This film does a terrific job telling a story of a human, Charlie whom decides to stop living his life when tragic strikes. Everyone has had moments in life when a loved one passes, a relationship comes to an end, or an unexpected diagnosis appears which tests our mind, body, souls, and heart. At these times some people go on living, some people strive to go above and beyond, while others may give up and count the hours. Charlie is a character who gives up on living his everyday life and because of this gives in to his vice of over eating causing his weight to spike resulting in dangerous obesity. Each day he does the minimum amount and apologizes excessively for his existence to the people in his life that care the most about him.Fraser gives an Oscar worthy performance as Charlie, as does director Darren Aronofsky in presenting Charlie's world, a one-bedroom apartment presented to the audience in a small format. We feel trapped like Charlie does. The score by Simonsen is beautifully done, especially the end of the film with the track titled \"Safe Return\", it is an emotional rollercoaster.This film shows the audience a reflection of either themselves or someone close to them that has given up on life and each day is just waiting to die by giving into over indulgence. The film shows how we want what is best for these people and how frustrating it can be to see someone who love in this state of being.",
  "The hardest movie I've watched in years....": "The moment I knew Brendan Fraser was back in another film, with a big breakthrough role, I just couldn't say no to this. In fact, my expectations were pretty high about this film before going in. Let me tell ya, those expectations went to being overly powerful and left me in such a state of just...\"WOW, I don't know what to say right now...\", as I was walking out with my best friend after it ended. This was an entirely different film for Brendan Fraser, compared to many of his typical action, comedy movies he usually did.The film deals with so many realistic situations that families go through. Cheating, divorce, money, father daughter relationships, mother daughter relationships, friendships, taxes, school, stress, anger, depression, but the #1 of all in this, which was very hard for me to view, even though I'm not obese, was the consequences of STRESS eating and how it can affect your entire life. I'm not going to say much more, but after you watch this movie, it's gonna make you not only think about life, but think about yourself.One more thing. BRILLIANT WRITING.",
  "Brendan Fraser commands the screen": "Welcome back Brendan Fraser! It should go without saying that he is the highlight of this film, his incredible performance is something that will go down in history. Darren Aronofsky's \"The Whale\" is frankly nothing without Fraser's powerhouse of a performance. If you had an actor who did any less than what Fraser did, this film would not work as well as it does. Fraser is the foundation of this film's success; without him everything would fall. Because it is a one-room story that very much does feel like watching a stage play, even more is left up to the actors than in a usual film, this format demands strong performances. And here we got Brandan Fraser, proving that he has so much more to offer as an actor than what we previously thought! In fact, I would argue he has delivered one of the most emotionally devastating performances we have ever seen on film - he damn near broke my heart over and over again every time he had a line of dialogue. This is a career-defining performance for Fraser, and he should be a shoe-in for a nomination at this year's Academy Awards. Brendan Fraser deserves the Oscar for this one and it's not even close. His performance was so heartbreaking and completely knocks it out of the park, same with the rest of the cast. Sadie Sink was also phenomenal! I have really only ever seen her in \"Stranger Things\", but wow did she ever blow me away here! Hong Chau, Ty Simpkins and Samantha Morton also had some incredible moments, this really is an actor's movie! The main reason to see this movie really is for the performances, as every single actor is giving their best work here!\"The Whale\" is an honest, raw and emotionally devastating film. Don't expect to come out of this one feeling good, it really did tear my emotions to shreds as it touches on themes of depression, religion, faith, pain and regret. It's about human, more specifically family connection. It is a character study about one broken man who is filled with pain and regret; one who has lost himself and seems to have lost everything, and yet he still has such a strong sense of optimism and can see the good in people. Due to the strong direction you really feel Charlie's pain from his perspective. It broke my heart. Aronofsky's direction is very strong, he handled the tone and story very well, even if it does seem like a carbon copy of the stage play. I also liked his visual approach a lot. The murky, dim interior that we're confined to as our protagonist is also trapped in his own regret, grief, and failure. The pouring of light into the room at the end is a very powerful visual choice even if it was somewhat obvious. The 4:3 aspect ratio really helped to assist with the intimate yet claustrophobic feel of the film, and the film's single setting worked to the film's advantage by adding to the film's generally depressing and isolated tone. The setting itself, as mentioned before, really put a lot of onus on the actors to deliver performances that would make the movie stand out. And that they did; those performances are phenomenal. I do think it's a little messy thematically and some moments feel kinda silly, but overall the tragic nature of the story and the emotion woven in really swept me away and broke my heart.The movie is not for everyone, some may find it uncomfortably unenjoyable. Those who enjoy it will be the ones who can find the messages about family connection, about pain, loss and regret. It is a depressing and emotional story, carried by some incredible performances from the entire cast. Brendan Fraser turns in a career defining performance that's heart wrenching and powerful and beautiful. You won't want to miss this movie for his performance alone!",
  "If you get the movie... you know.": "... like all reviews they're subjective , and largely based on how good the acting was , the story, the meaning and also the intelligence of the viewer to understand said meaning. This draws you in to a film, maybe more than other people, let's you immerse yourself into it, and on that basis enjoy it more, because you understand what the author/writer is trying to do. I'm sure you can interpret the \"meaning\" in a few ways , but for me, it was the guilt of a father who felt he'd betrayed his daughter, and the daughter, who thought her dad didn't lover her which wasn't true! And which made her behaviour like it was. They found their common ground in the essays, and realised that they both understood each other, loved each other, and that things could of been different.. sadly too late.And yes I'm also saying that people who mark this film low .. sub 6 or 7 are unintelligent morons!",
  "Difficult": "The Whale is not an easy movie, asking us to think about our choices, what we are for ourselves and for others and what we want to be from now on. The feeling of claustrophobia is unsettling, but I take that to its credit. Aronofsky never wanted this to be comfortable and the image - 4:3 ratio - and sound - always tense in anticipation of something terrible - options make that clear.Even so, the director approaches these heavy themes with the sensitivity of someone who has spent the day chopping wood. The magnificent interpretations of Brendan Fraser and Hong Chau offer us the sensitivity that the text often lacks.",
  "Truly outstanding": "I doubt I can add much more to what has already been said about 'The Whale', but in a word: Bravo!Brendan Fraser truly is sensational in this role. I heard about all the acclaim and seen a few of the standing ovations he has received and all I can say is that it is unequivocally deserved. Truly outstanding from the first scene (yes, even with that... ha) to the very last. It's great to see the dude that I first saw as a kid in 'George of the Jungle' well and truly back in the game.One thing about Fraser getting all the (undoubtedly merited) plaudits from this Darren Aronofsky flick is that I didn't know what to expect from the support cast, and man are there some absolutely stellar performances behind Fraser. Sadie Sink, Ty Simpkins and Samantha Morton are top notch, though Hong Chau is a cut above that trio - brilliant stuff from her!There are some powerful scenes in there. I'm not one to cry with fictional works (my brain automatically knows it's 'fake', I can't help it) but man even I got major goosebumps and gut punches (pardon the pun?) from what's portrayed onscreen. Fraser, and Chau, are naturally the major reasons for that, but everyone - on and off the screen - deserves big props for this 2022 film.The definition of a must-watch.",
  "Disappointingly fatphobic pity porn": "I wanted to love this film. I have liked many of Aronofsky's previous films (particularly Requiem for a Dream) and it was great to see Brendan Fraser back on the screen. Unfortunately, what I found was an astoundingly fatphobic piece of pity porn. Most of the supporting characters are incredibly unlikeable & engage in abusing Charlie in one form or another. It felt like 2 hours of watching \"fat Monica\" from Friends dancing with food in her hands.The actors all do their best with what they are given. Brendan Fraser does well, all things considered, but does overham it (pun intended) at times in an obvious attempt for an Oscar. I fear that he will win it too, for being \"brave\" enough to play such an obese character therefore cementing how acceptable fatphobia is again. Sadie Sink tries her best, but doesn't even reach the levels she achieved in Stranger Things though. Hardly surprising, as her character comes across as a psychopath (particularly given how abusive she is to animals & people alike). At first, Samantha Morton's character seemed like yet another cliche, but her performance managed to redeem that character by giving a great deal more nuance. Hong Chau is excellent as Charlie's friend, despite playing a dangerously enabling character.My main problem is that the film is obsessed with showing the audience a morbidly obese man devouring large amounts of unhealthy food. We get it, he's fat because he eats too much. We don't need to have it shoved down our throats, as we constantly see him doing. The inclusion of things such as various humiliating situations (including seeing his naked torso, him struggling to walk, the porn incident) all reinforce the idea that the only way you can connect with such a character is through pity rather than understanding. They seem to think that's all fine though, because (shock, horror) turns out the obese man has feelings. Who'd a thunk it? This film could've dealt with the issue so much more sensitively, instead it joins in.If anyone needs to go to the cinema & watch something so humiliating towards obese people, just to humanise them & realise they deserve sympathy, then there's something hugely wrong with our society.",
  "Simplicity makes for reality!": "This movie keeps it simple, and in doing so really lets you get to know the characters. The fact that the movie was this good when it all took place in one room is incredible. While the writing the was certainly great, this movie was carried on the shoulders of Brendan Fraser. He kept you watching every scene. The suit and makeup for his obesity was great. His scenes almost make you want to cry. These character all suffer from past and present sins. Even if you don't deal with the same sins, these characters feel very real, and you are sympathetic towards each of them although they are messed up in different ways. This movie is full of small heartfelt moments that make the movie. Fraser's breakdown in front of his ex-wife, his depressed eating spree, and the last minute of the movie were standouts for me. The depressed eating stood out because it showed how a complete stranger and small interactions can have a huge impact on people. This is very real and happens in the workplace. But this pizza guy who should've known that Charlie was fat by all the pizza he brings, looks as if he saw bigfoot when he sees Charlie for the first time. And this is what tips Charlie into full suicidal again after trying hard to make some connection with his daughter. While Simpkins and Chau did very solid in their roles, Sadie Sink was the other standout performance. What seems like an unrealistically naive teenager feels real with her performance. Yes, I realize I keep saying real, but that is what drove this movie: emotions. All her evil acts that would sound over the top on paper, worked with her performance. And the breakdown in the last scene was the best climax. People do care.",
  "\"Who Would Want Me to Be a Part of Their Life?\"": "There are few filmmakers like Darron Aronofsky. His early work is sublime, his aughts work is interesting and unconventional, but his recent work has been disappointing. Noah and Mother! Are cleverly visceral and anarchic, but they're also bogged down in religious symbolism and shallow metaphor, lacking the substance of the filmmaker's greatest films. The Whale is a nice return to form, even if missing Aronofsky's trademark frenetic hysteria. Written by Samuel D. Hunter, and adapted from his play, the script is not spectacular, but it is dense, thought-provoking, and well-paced.The film follows Charlie, a morbidly obese man who teaches English for an online college. Having recently come to terms with his own mortality, Charlie tries to reconnect with his daughter, volatile and callously apathetic Ellie. The entire story takes place within Charlie's apartment; nurse Liz and proselytizer Thomas also visit, and the film's drama is drawn from each character's unique interactions with the others.Chamber pieces are in vogue, most likely because of the limitations presented by the pandemic. At least five films in the last three months (The Menu, Glass Onion, Skinamarink, Knock at the Cabin, and The Whale) have taken place in one primary venue. The technique is usually a mark of miniscule budgets or ambitious screenwriters, but these films (sans Skinamarink) are at least relatively expensive and reasonably conventional.Of these five films, The Whale feels most purposeful in its use of a single location, most likely because it's adapted from a stage play, and written by a playwright. The film is an intimate story with refreshingly small but impactful stakes; it's focused and thematically dense enough to hold attention throughout, implicitly justifying its economical narrative and construction.The Whale feels and watches like a play, for better or worse, sometimes simultaneously. Much of the early dialogue is clunkily expositional and characterizations are lean. However, there is deceptive depth to characters' conflict and relationships, leading to provocative questions posed throughout, both subtly and explicitly.Although The Whale's plot doesn't usually unfold organically - much of its movement is spurred by someone entering or exiting a room, much like a sitcom - its scenes are impressively balanced between brevity and elongated elegance. Plotting is clunky but expedient, and the sum result has an impressive sense of internal rhythm and timing. The Whale is eventually too lumbering and overstuffed, but this is the result of an overaccumulation of sharp observations, rather than a confused, non-committal slog.The Whale is sharp and thoughtful, but it's also abjectly miserable. It's a type of story where every character is melodramatically \"broken\" and searching for a new light to guide their spiritual redemption. Directors who miscalculate this type of drama churn out Noel and Simon Birch, but Aronofsky is obviously too skilled to produce such pablum.Instead of a lighter sense of emotional misery, The Whale is dark: the apartment is dark, the script is dark, the characters are dark; any optimism springs from either regret or misplaced nostalgia. Aronofsky is often cynical, but he abandons all hope before entering The Whale's worldview, falling into cold misanthropy, even blunt nihilism. Whether or not the film's dramatic integrity is deep or focused enough to warrant such hopelessness is up to the viewer.The general depression of the film does not overshadow its characters but springs from them. For all of The Whale's thematic probing, twisting, and questioning, there's a surprising and disappointing lack of agency to the entire affair. Charlie and friends continuously, and drearily, wallow in their own circumstances, never attempting to overcome or improve on life's knockdowns.Admittedly, this lack of self-ownership may be the point, as all involved are either battling addictions or too young, arrogant, or na\u00c3\u00afve to broaden their perspectives, but The Whale's overwhelming feeling is one of self-pity and helplessness, both learned and innate. The film tries to abruptly reverse course in its final moments, but this mismatched contortion is not enough to wash the taste of pathetic failure out of one's mouth.The drama of the film is solidly elevated by Aronofsky and his cast. The director restrains himself throughout, creating space and time for Hunter's dialogue to breathe. Although his technique is consistently successful, I couldn't help but wish the script allowed for greater and more frequent Aronofskyesque flourishes.There is a point wherein The Whale seems to be lifting off, to finally be careening off its meticulously placid railing, but the attempt fizzles; in seconds, the story is back on track and its repetition resumes, as if the potential for deviation never existed. Like its story, the film's camerawork is stark and dry, a decidedly serious attempt to chisel high drama and court sophisticated audiences. Those who consider themselves highbrow will probably swoon, but I gravitate toward the raw, kinetic verve of Aronofsky's earlier work - I prefer my senses engulfed.As mentioned, The Whale is greatly elevated by its performances, most notably Fraser's. His transformation into a 600 pound man (made possible by heavy prosthetics) is striking and absorbing, but his performance is impactful mostly because of the pain and remorse in his eyes and heart.Fraser plays into the misery porn well, eliciting true sympathy and genuine care from the characters and audience. He's soft spoken and understands the overbearing pathos of the material, presenting vulnerabilities not typically seen from a past action hero. Aronofsky presents the material deftly, but Fraser makes it work. The rest of the cast - Sadie Sink, Ty Simpkins, Hong Chau, and Samantha Morton - play dutifully into the melodrama, portraying their corrosive sad sacks with palpable humanity.The Whale is so stuffed with drama that it has a little something for everybody, at least those who can overlook its general misery and dour outlook. There are soulful themes of past mistakes, parental absence, and potential redemption; characters are outlined well, if not too deeply felt or particularly relatable.The film is a nice showcase of Aronofsky's talents as a minimalist and a magnificent showcase for Fraser's maturation as an actor, but it's just too enamored with its characters' misery to give viewers the catharsis of their redemption. Fans of adult filmmaking should see it for the talent both behind and in front of the camera, but I can't pretend the average moviegoer will come away whistling and satisfied.",
  "Worst Aronofsky movie": "Pointless. Bland plot and characters. It's a boring comedy not a drama.I don't get any message or deep in the movie. You will be wishing the movie get to \"Friday chapter\" to stop looking at your watch. The movie has no heart but a silly poor written story about nothing. Big disappointment from one of my favorite directors. What a bunch of pretentious nonsense. Poorly crafted, tedious, self-absorbed, uninspiring, repulsive, whiny, irritating, self-pitying, empty, and depressing rubbish. Fraser is great, but the writing is shallow and obvious. The direction is amateurish at best, like something out of a local drama school. It's painful to see so much praise heaped upon this steaming pile of offal.Moral: If you're fat just do keto.",
  "Raw and Honest": "Give Brendan Fraser the Oscar already.Hollywood loves a comeback story and the return of Fraser to the Hollywood \"A\" list is complete with his heart-wrenching, honest turn in Darren Aronofsky's THE WHALE. It is the type of comeback that is deserving of all the accolades and awards that has come his way.Directed, with restraint not normally associated with Aronofsky, THE WHALE tells the tale of a College Professor who drowns his feelings in food. The film, based on the play (and screenplay) by Samuel D. Hunter follows this Professor, Charlie (Brendan Fraser of THE MUMMY fame) as he seeks to make amends with his estranged daughter as his obesity starts to take it's toll.Since this is based on a stage play, most of the film takes place inside Charlie's apartment and the number of characters in this film are limited - and all of them hit their mark very well, thanks to the Best Direction that Aronofsky has ever achieved. He limits his usual histrionics, letting the camera focus on the faces and emotions of his characters, keeping movement to a minimum and engrossing the audience in the punch that these emotions provide. It is a shame that he was not Nominated for an Oscar for his work here, it is masterful.Because of this - and the powerful script by Hunter - the cast of this film shines brightly. From Samantha Morton (MINORITY REPORT) to Ty Simpkins (JURASSIC WORLD) to Sadie Sink (Max Mayfield in Netflix' STRANGER THINGS), Aronofsky draws strong, raw and HONEST performances that elevate as each interact with each other.Hong Chau (giving her 2nd straight strong performance following her work in the under-rated and under-appreciated THE MENU) is also Oscar Nominated (for Supporting Actress) for her work as Charlie's caregiver. It is a subtle, loving, emotional performance that touches the heart and her Oscar nomination is well deserved.But, make no mistake about it, this film is Fraser's and he commands it from start to finish. Sure, the \"fat suit\" he is wearing that gives him the appearance of a 400 lb (+) obese man is jarring, but it is the raw emotions - rage, fear, sadness, hate, self-loathing and love - that Fraser is able to eminate through that wall of prosthetics that is truly astonishing. It is the performance of a career and one that will win him the Oscar.Welcome back, Brendan Fraser, the movies missed you.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",
  "This is Gonna be Worth Watching": "I got to screen this film for awards season purposes.It was very hard not to cry during several scenes.Branden Fraser is simply amazing. Under direction of Aronofsky it's probably the best dramatic film of the year.Really if you all see this Movie you can releate everything every scene\nYou are going to connect with every character in movie\nEveryone giving their best in this movie\nI really really loved it\nAnd i think if you really just comparing this movie with others don't do that it's not good at all this movie is different\nBest acting\nBest scenes\nBest message\nAnd everything in this movie is best\nI loved it.",
  "Welcome Back Brendan Fraser !": "I like Darren Aronofsky. I find most of his movies good. Except Noah :) I was intrigued after hearing this movie and watching its trailer. Although Brendan Fraser may not be everyone's favorite actor, he is someone that most people know and love from their childhood, including myself, through The Mummy movie series. I read what happened to him. Too bad. He also did a great job in this movie. He should definitely win the Best Actor Oscar, and he must take part in more dramatic roles. I 'm happy that he is back. Actually, I think it's a very simple and well-described movie. Judging by the Darren Aronofsky filmography, this movie looks a bit weak, but it's still a good movie. The best thing in this movie were the acting performances and the makeup. The movie is already a single location movie. The script was also good. Sadie Sink, Hong Chau, Samantha Morton performed very well. I didn't like Ty Simpkins' acting in this movie, but he tried to do his best. There is no need to talk much about the movie. Brendan Fraser was excellent. Also, congratulations to the make-up team, they did a great job, you can't tell if it's fake.",
  "A brilliant insight into broken families and obesity": "Loved this movie. It beautifully deals with the complexity of familial relations, especially post separation of parents. Many times the choice is between two difficult situations; live your current painful existance or make a change which breaks you, and your relationships. There's no right or wrong. When people in these situations don't have empathy for others in the breakdown, conflict and extreme emotions are inevitable.The movie also reveals a version of why people might suffer extreme obesity. Here, it was borne out of sadness. When people drink themselves to alcoholism, society accepts it even when it was borne out of pain management. With obesity however the perspective is generally one of disgust, lack of self discipline, gluttony, laziness and so on. These people equally need help. And the best help may not necessarily be dietary or fitness, rather emotional and mental support. The lead character in this movie was ultimately yearning for love.",
  "Not the greatest subject matter, but this was an emotional watch with stunning performances.": "A Film about a heavily obese man will no doubt offend many viewers. Some might even call it vulgar. But this film made me wonder what it must be like for obese people. Yes, some are obese by their own doing, but others might be obese due to a medical condition. Whatever the reason, I sympathize with them after seeing this movie.The film is highlighted by a magnificent performance by Brendan Fraser. He stars as a gay, obese man, Charlie, who teaches online and never leaves his apartment. His good friend, and the sister of his deceased lover, Liz (Hong Chau) looks after him. Also a fantastic performance by Hong Chau. Charlie was married once and has a daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), with whom he wants to reconcile, and offer to write her school essays for her.Ellie is foul-mouthed and rude, and sees Charlie as \"disgusting\". She agrees to visit him when Charlie says he'll give her all his money. Ty Simpkins stars as Thomas, a missionary from New Life Church, who wants \"to save\" Charlie. I didn't really fully understand this character - especially during the third act when secrets about him are revealed.Almost the entire film is set in Charlie's living room, but despite the confined space I never found the film claustrophobic or boring. On the contrary, I was infested in this movie and rooted for Charlie all the way. I never expected the film to have so many reveals, which was rather interesting.As mentioned, this film will offend some viewers, and I'm sure some will hate it. I was spellbound by Brendan Fraser's performance. This is a touching film with an emotional ending. This was actually so good!",
  "Amazing Emotional Depth": "Wow was all I could feel as I walked out of the theatre from this one. I haven't given a movie a 10 for a very long time. I was beginning to think that maybe I was being a bit too cynical with how I watched films but this movie just showed me the bar at which an exceptional film can be at.I was amazed at how authentic a movie that takes place in 2016 felt. So many people live a life like Charlie's, Alan's, Thomas's or Ellis and it just was so raw.I felt like a major theme of this film was being honest with oneself about who they are and what they can do. A bit more honesty can help everyone make better decisions for themselves and those they love.Great film that just blew me away.",
  "Most Depressing Film Since 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape'": "Don't get me wrong. The acting is absolutely, magnificently superb. It is.Still, this was hard to watch throughout 90% of the film. It's a film about a man who has self-medicated through food for so long, and to such an incredible extent, that he isn't even able to walk across a room, and Sadie Sink's character is awful to him throughout the entire film.So, what you're getting yourself into is watching clinical, pathological, terrifying eating and a teenage brat berating a mentally ill man for two hours.Maybe it's uplifting to some in an esoteric way, but this film gave me the same bleak, depressing, misanthropic feelings I got watching 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' thirty years ago.",
  "Great performance": "The acting was some of the best I have seen. The shots were well done and the never got boring despite being set mostly in the same location. They maintained the theme of confinement and isolation in an inspired way. My only complaint is the ending was a bit goofy and kind of cut the tone short. However, the performances were so fantastic that I can forgive that flaw. I am not the biggest of of this director, but this film is easily one of the best I've seen in a while, and I will be rewatching it soon. There's the common themes of religion and spirituality he seems to like using in all of his films, however here I think it was handled well without being overly crude or on the nose.",
  "pretty decent film but the average user rating is way too high": "No spoilers at all here but I just want you to think about this...this movie has higher ratings than classics like:American Gangster (2007), All quiet on the western front (2022), The day the earth stood still (1951), The outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Home Alone (1990), The Hangover (2009), The Fifth Element (1997), Superbad (2007), As good as it gets (1997) and American Psycho (2000)Let that sink in..... We get it, there was a huge controversy behind this film amongst other things so it brought attention to many people and they came here to support our most loved Mr. Fraser but there is NO WAY this movie should have anything close to a PERFECT 10. A perfect 10 screams bias and there are suspiciously many 10's here...This isn't even worth a second watch for me so I deleted it right after I was done. Maybe I'll give it another watch but that won't be anytime in the near future.It wasn't exciting yet it was interesting enough to watch the whole thing through yet didn't meet any type of gratification at the end... nothing at all blew my mind in the slightest about the film and the only likable people to me were Liz and Charlie so at times I got pretty bored especially during scenes with Thomas and Ellie that i felt were too long. The acting was pretty good I can admit! In a couple scenes it could've been better.I love Brendan to death as I grew up to him since Airheads. It kills me that this is now his highest rated film ever.",
  "Pity for the fat guy": "With the obligatory gay-theme included, the story of this morbidly obese whale cannot hold water.While it's nice to see Brendan Fraser again, this stage play performance was not his best moment--even \"Encino Man\" showcased his skills in a much better light. One of the best scenes was probably 'Dan' --the Gambino's Pizza delivery guy when he introduced himself through a closed door.I'm happy to give this wreck 2 stars for the great-looking \"Fat Suit\" and the wretched, smelly apartment scenario which complimented the wretched and smelly screenplay. The gay (and dead) boyfriend was just another sideline that falls under its own weight.",
  "Suicidal quest a'la MOBY DICK": "Loved this film. Uncontrollable sobbing overtook me, even 10 minutes after the credits were finished. Fraser brought to life such a believable and sympathetic character, that throughout the entire movie I kept randomly crying over how touching and real his performance was as the morbidly obese shut-in English teacher, battling his demons.I know many people see this movie mainly as being one that centers around addiction and the far-reaching consequences of them. However, the real message of this film seems to be a more subtle lesson of \"man's search for meaning in a world of deceptive appearances and fatal delusions,\" which is how Laurie Robertson-Lorant described MOBY DICK, a novel which the movie heavily references.Throughout the movie we are shown all of the characters' strengths and contradicting flaws. Charlie believes that everyone is good and worthy of love, except himself. Liz is forgiving of Charlie and empathizes with his illness, yet also enables it, perhaps even in a passive-aggressive manner as subconscious revenge for her brother's death. Ellie is called \"evil\" by her own mother and is considered the social pariah in high school, however she ends up saving Thomas and reuniting him with his family. All Thomas wants to do is \"help,\" but ends up hurting Charlie in the worst way, insinuating that God punished him and Alan for being gay. Mary is an overprotective mother who wants the best for her daughter, yet denies her access to the only thing which would bring her normalcy, that being her father. And even the pizza guy Dan is a person who wants to reach out and befriend his repeat customer, but upon seeing Charlie's physical appearance, Dan is disgusted and immediately regrets breaking their unspoken privacy pact.Aronofsky does an excellent job, too, using misdirection to fool us into focusing on the characters' flaws when their strengths are actually being shown, and vice versa. For example, Charlie tells Ellie that he keeps his webcam off so his students won't see what he looks like. Aronofsky utilizes subtle camera angles and tense situations to make us suspect that Ellie will secretly change the webcam settings on his camera in order to accidentally expose his appearance to his students. Ellie also takes candid photos of people without their permission, records their private confessions, and even drugs them with Ambien. However, Ellie never does anything malicious to her father while he is asleep (we are led to believe in some way she drugged him in an act of compassion), even though the laptop is right in plain view. And her candid photos and recording of Thomas only serve as his liberation later on.It is also interesting to watch how each character has their own successful path, even though what's right for one character isn't necessarily right or deemed appropriate by another. For example, Charlie believes that giving his life savings to his daughter and accepting death is his path. He does not want nor need God or anyone else to save him. Thomas believes that God is the reason for all things, and that through God's power Ellie saved Thomas and reunited him with his family. Both of Charlie and Thomas truly believe in their individual paths with resounding conviction, and if we would try to interchange their paths, we would produce utter failure. Even though religion is what indirectly led Charlie to his demise (ie his partner committing suicide because he wasn't accepted by his family and the church for being gay), religion is what ends up saving Thomas. Even though Thomas wasn't very honest with himself and his life's desires, honesty is what saved Charlie's relationship with his daughter and let him die with peace and contentment. It is also important to note that Thomas possessed wisdom that Charlie lacked (ie \"It's only money!\"), while Charlie knew all too well that \"no one can save anyone.\"I also loved so many of the references and symbolism that tied into MOBY DICK. From focusing on various similar themes such as fate and free will, defiance, appearance vs reality, and religion, to the ending scene with the harpoon effect of pulling Charlie closer to Ellie and his own demise while she reads her essay, the movie does an excellent job with paralleling the novel in various ways.Overall, this was an extremely powerful and moving film. The acting performances and writing were deeply moving, and the direction was well paced and carefully constructed. Also, the special effects and makeup were incredible, which made me smile, remembering back to earlier times when CGI wasn't the answer for \"trompe l'oeil.\"",
  "Brendan Fraser mightily carries this movie!": "His Oscar-worthy performance as Charlie is exceptionally good! He portrays a morbidly obese English teacher on the verge of dying of congestive heart failure. With a really small cast, the film works under Darren Aronofsky's masterful direction. Charlie is isolated due to his condition, cut off from the outside world other than his caregiver who also happens to be the sister of his dead lover, his rebellious teen daughter, a visiting missionary, a pizza delivery guy, and his divorced wife. He teaches creative writing online and his students are seen while he isn't. The film is a periscope into Charlie's world and what he goes through day after day and the intense interactions he has until the final days of his life. HIGHLY recommended!!!",
  "Stage play, empathy workout": "I watched it with the reminder that I was watching a stage play. Someone else wrote that which helped me appreciate and remember that the focus was on the characters and the limits of what I would be shown. This focusing thought helped me put myself inside that box verse waiting to get away from my discomfort of the tight intimate space. Course I'm the sort of person who never feels like knowing the plot spoils anything but in this story I think not knowing what happened did make it all the better. I would say the whole movie culminated into a beautiful ending which I'm only revealing as this review is apparently too short. I did like his message about caring and it wrapped up nicely in his daughter's essay which shared how sad she was when she found someone hiding their loneliness. That was the nice reveal that left me in a lot tears, that the daughter was just lonely and sad vs the label of evil that the mother had boxed her in with. The movie also gave me a lot to think about such as how the different characters struggled with their inability to stop caring, even with the various distractions they hid in. Thank you for the movie everyone who worked on it, and also the play which I now want to go see \ud83d\udc4d",
  "Magnificent performances carried by a deep and compelling character arc.": "I'll get this out of the way, the movie does get a tad boring towards the middle. But I want to clarify that the performance IS all it's cracked up to be. The entire cast was stunning, and the exceptional performance from Fraser brought tears to my eyes multiple times. I was also a fan of how deep the story really got, and the entire thought process behind loss and behind religion. Not for everyone, but it is nothing short of amazing. I can whole-heartedly say that Brendan Fraser is back, and this role deserves an Oscar. And the set/costume design is nothing to ignore. The haunting and devastating apartment complex to the disturbingly realistic suit that he wears really draws you into this foreboding atmosphere. The audio production was top-notch with a beautiful orchestra of strings to either exclaim or soften the mood of the scene. And the eating disorders were tenfold to exemplify the horror you were watching. In the end, i believe this movie is phenomenal and shouldn't be skipped.",
  "Resurgence of Brendan Fraser; and I'm loving every moment of it!": "\"Do you ever get the feeling people are incapable of not caring? People are amazing\"The film may not have performed quite the way I had hoped, but how can I possibly overlook the stupendous performance delivered by our main protagonist here? Brendan Fraser has poured his heart and everything into this role, and let me tell you, it hasn't been easy for him, especially after his lengthy and lonesome break from the scene!Given its premise, the narrative needed or should I say was heavily reliant on whoever occupies the shoes of the protagonist, and I have to say, Brendan rose to the situation and handled it like a professional! Not to mention that he added his personal touch while he was at it, so I was bawling my eyes out the entire time!To me, he didn't seem to be trying to imitate a self-loathing soul who has given up all hope for redemption; rather, he seemed to be reconciling with his own flawed past, as if he's scouring through his mistakes, his own life, in the hope of finding something meaningful, something that would liberate him from his shackles, something that would ease his burden, and make him whole again!His portrayal felt incredibly personal to me; he wasn't just reading words from a petty paper; he was feeling it, enduring it all, and I couldn't be happier with the news of his Oscar nomination. I wish him all the luck and I'll be cheering for him; he'd be a worthy winner!",
  "Sad": "Trgic and absolutely well done movie. I really enjoyed the one setting location and the way the film was drafted and directed. It is really a though proviking drama. Sometimes maybe a bit too cartoonish and too cliched but you can easily forgive this if you look at the complete essence of the film.There is no doubt that Brendan Fraser gives one of the best performances of the year and probbly the best of his career. It is the best example of a come back performance. Welcome back Mr. Fraser. I just wished Hollywood hadnt ignored your great talent the past years!He nailed the role, he got my emotional captivted for the whole time and I just hoped all the time he would get the redemption his character deserves.Hong Chau was fantastic as well. She really stood out even in scenes with Fraser she was able to own the screen and that is something to really point out, given how amazing Fraser was. I liked how natural she was and that she created a real character out of this.The weakest link was unfortunately Sadie Sink. As great as she was on Stranger Things, as disappointing she was here. I dont think she understood her character's depth and played it like a spoiled brat. Which it was. But Sink didnt allow us to look beneath the surface and thats a shame. I also think thats where Darren Aronofsky failed a bit in his direction. As great as he developed Fraser and Chau, it seemed he did not care for his other supporting characters that much. Especially Sink. But also Samantha Morton was sometimes overacting and cringy.Ty Simpkins was fine, I think he was the only one who could break out of his stereotype.The score was great, the screenplay was great and the message was great. I did love the ending, not all of it, but the way it ended was just killing me. Great job. Great movie. A must see.",
  "A powerful performance from Fraser": "This film is centered around Brendan Fraser's obese and isolated character and its success relies on him. Not only does he carry this film he gives a powerful, deep and heart felt performance. You believe and almost feel everything you see. His agony, pain and struggle is very real. He knows he does not have much time left so he wants to reconnect with his badly behaved daughter. Sadie Sink gives a great performance and shows how much potential and depth she has as a young actress. This is a tough film at times to watch but it also feels like a very real one. Nothing is glossed over and exaggerated and it feels like a relatable performance from Fraser. If he does win the Oscar for best actor, it is well deserved.",
  "An Exercise in Enlightenment for the Close-minded": "The old saying about glass houses and not throwing stones seems fittingly apropos here, both for the characters in this story and the ever-so-cynical critics who have so unfairly and recklessly flung their condescending bile-laden assessments toward this offering. Director Darren Aronofsky's latest tells the heartbreaking and heartwarming tale of a 600-pound gay man (Brendan Fraser) whose health is quickly failing and struggles to make up for past misgivings and to work out long-lingering self-worth issues during what time he has left, neither of which come easily and often seem insurmountable. At the same time, however, we also see a character who frequently and genuinely manages to see the best in people, despite having often been the object of cruel, unapologetic ridicule and needlessly hard on himself. It's an outlook that few of us are able to imagine, let alone sustain, but, having been on the receiving end of both the good and the bad in others, he chooses to look for the best and to believe that such a benevolent attitude is our natural tendency, despite seeming evidence to the contrary. Now if he could only come to embrace the same view for himself. This thoughtful, insightful picture gives us much to contemplate (something many mercilessly ignorant, shallow-minded reviewers seem to have failed to grasp), reminding us to make the most of our beliefs during the short time we have in our lives. Admittedly, there are some segments in which the dialogue is somewhat awkward and stilted (even though the rationale behind this is ultimately revealed, even if a bit odd when initially introduced). But this modest shortcoming is more than made up for by the film's superb ensemble cast (arguably the best I've seen thus year), with stellar performances by Fraser (truly deserving of this year's best actor honors) and a fine crew of supporting players, including Sadie Sink, Hong Chau, Samantha Morton and Ty Simpkins. I truly feel sorry for those who have missed the message behind this excellent offering, but, then, if they've never walked in the shoes of someone like the protagonist, I suppose that's understandable. For those who have been there, though (like myself), this is a moving tale that easily draws out the compassion in others - provided they have it to give in the first place (something I have to wonder about given some of the reviews I've read). If it's something that the cynics have never had to contend with before, then maybe they'll learn something from watching this release.",
  "Drama Porn": "The Whale is a good movie. It has great direction, production and acting. But it's emotive agenda is O. T. T. It's much like watching a mother slap a baby in the face for an hour and a half.It's not The Wrestler, where we see a community of over-the-hill performers juggle their failing careers and families in a realistic, social setting.Morbid obesity is a rapidly growing (no pun intended) social issue in an ever-richer - and isolated - world. But there's no reference to that in the Whale. Indeed, The Whale's preoccupation with one man's self-destruction - becomes a parody, as he shovels handfuls of food into his mouth. Obese people don't usually eat or live like that! The Whale is a grotesque caricature, rather than a true dramatic portrayal of life.",
  "Acting is great but definitely overrated!": "It's great to see Brandon on the screen again, he's a great actor in everything he does. Sadie and Ty were great too and probably the more interesting characters even though they had less screen time. But all of the actors performed very well. Though I had high hopes for this movie given all the rave reviews, but I keep forgetting rave reviews often mean the opposite. Despite the great acting by the cast, the writing and execution were weak and just lame, full of so many cliches and overdone themes. I do like the dynamic of Ellie and Thomas, seeing their relationship with Charlie and each other, and how they see good in very different ways. The ending while emotional was just plain cheesy. Unfortunately, I finished movie feeling like that was a complete waste of time and feel like the cast deserved better.",
  "I sobbed so hard I almost threw up": "I'm not one to cry in the theater, I find it very awkward. However, I hysterically sobbed watching the ending of the film. It had my friend crying as well, and my significant other shedding tears. I was afraid this movie would never show up at our local movie theater, but I'm so glad it did. I don't know how this movie is not rated higher, it was truly a cinematic masterpiece. I haven't seen a movie this well casted, directed, and released in a long time. It flowed so well, with all of its characters. Brendan Frazier deserved that standing ovation for his performance. A24 out did themselves with this movie it was truly beautiful to watch.",
  "Great drama": "The Whale is a truly heartbreaking, emotionally rich drama about self loathing and the physical burden of grief that transcends it's theatrical roots thanks a strong cast led by a soulful and never better Brendan Fraser in the lead role.Brendan Fraser is perfect, the make-up to transform him into this character is extremely impressive but never overshadows his performance from his extremely expressive and devastating looks to the constant pain and anguish that moves you to tears frequently.Sadie Sink is terrific with an instant confidence and closed off presence that make her character deliberately hard to read. Hong Chau is amazing, with a warmth and kindness that makes her scenes with Fraser so beautiful to watch and Ty Simpkins' enjoyably awkward character develops into someone's much more complex.Darren Aronofsky's direction is great, whilst it can be heavy handed at times it's still suitably claustrophobic with a firm grasp of the required tone. The music by Rob Simonsen is really good, it's not present all the time but when it is it's extremely evocative.",
  "An absolute wrecking ball of emotions": "The best way I can describe what watching \"The Whale\" is like is if you stared at a black tv screen or mirror showing your reflection for so long that it makes you uncomfortable. Even if you don't have an eating disorder or addiction of any kind it still creates this feeling. When you think something about yourself is disgusting and get it in your head that it's all others see when they look at you.This movie is about the consequences that trauma and addiction (frequently paired together) have on both the human mind and body. Fraser gives one of the best movie performances I've ever seen as Charlie, a man who has a food addiction and as a result is morbidly obese. Immediately some may hear this and assume it picks at the fat guy, a trope that Hollywood shamefully frequents. However, here you feel nothing but empathy for Charlie. Fraser's Hollywood hiatus is completely forgotten about as he seems like he never stopped acting. His performance is probably the best I've seen since Heath Ledger's in \"The Dark Knight\". Anything less than an Oscar nomination, and possible win would be shocking to say the least.Without getting into spoilers I will say this is the most emotionally provoking movie I've ever seen. Also one of the better movies in general that I've ever seen. I haven't cried to a movie in 15 years, and \"The Whale\" came dangerously close to breaking that streak. I cannot say the same for others in the theatre however. I could hear sniffling from some and bawling from others.Finally, there was a negative thing I noticed about the movie. It is a screenplay adapted from a play which is immediately noticeable. Characters pause at the door or exaggerate their movements, common ways of portraying emotions on stage to an audience sitting hundreds of feet away. This was the only negative however and does not deter me from giving a solid 10/10.",
  "Depth": "This film is depressing for all the right reasons. It exams rather difficult and sensitive issues. God, love, obesity, abandonment, ableism, enablement, alcoholism, depression, suicide.This is not a film that holds your hand. It wants you to ponder and discuss. The acting is superb from Fraser. He is Charlie. At no point was I not convinced that Charlie couldn't be a real person, his problems and emotions are very real. They are the emotions that many of us have and that many may even deny.What I suggest is that you don't focus on the depressing nature and aspect of the film but view it for what it is trying to show you. That people are very capable of incredibly complex emotions and are always worthy of love.",
  "Good performances": "The Whale is a heart-wrenching story about a man named Charlie (Brendan Fraser) who weighs over 600 pounds and is slowly eating himself to death. The movie is a character-driven piece that explores the complexity of relationships, the power of forgiveness, and the struggles of addiction. While the story itself is not groundbreaking, the movie is elevated by excellent performances, particularly the support actors.One of the standout performances in The Whale comes from Sadie Sink, who plays Charlie's teenage daughter, Ellie. Her' portrayal of a young girl struggling to come to terms with her father's leaving, and subsequent self-destructive behaviour is both nuanced and moving. She is able to convey a range of emotions, from anger and frustration to sadness and desperation, in a way that feels authentic and relatable.Another standout performance comes from the ever reliable Samantha Morton, who plays Charlie's ex-wife. She brings a depth and complexity to his character that makes him much more than just a stereotypical \"deserted wife.\" She is able to convey the pain and hurt that Charlie has caused her, while also showing compassion and understanding for the man he once loved.The supporting cast in The Whale is rounded out by a talented group of actors, including Hong Chau as Charlie's nurse, who provides Charlie with a sounding board for his thoughts and feelings. While these characters may not have as much screen time as the main characters, they are able to make a significant impact on the story and the audience.The Whale is a movie that relies heavily on its performances to carry the weight (sorry!) of the story, and fortunately, the actors do not disappoint. Fraser gives a powerful and moving performance as Charlie, bringing a vulnerability and authenticity to the character that makes him both sympathetic and relatable. He is able to convey the pain and suffering that Charlie is experiencing, while also showing the love and compassion that he has for his daughter.The Whale is a movie that is sure to tug at the heartstrings of anyone who watches it. While the story itself may not be groundbreaking, the performances of the actors, particularly the support actors, elevate the movie to a level that makes it worth watching. It is a moving and emotional film that explores the complexities of the human experience in a way that is both poignant and powerful.",
  "The Last 30 Minutes": "The last 30 minutes are beautiful. It's trauma, healing, acceptance, grief, hope, and sadness all at once. You're confused, then your questions are answered. You're feeling empathic then angry. Happy then full on sobbing. The final scene had me sobbing hysterically. Masterful filmmaking with world class acting. A24 has yet to create a film that doesn't move you at its core. This has to be, genuinely, one of the greatest A24 films yet. I felt every emotion in the span of the runtime, and the fact the movie takes place in one setting for the entire duration is a triumph to just how amazing of a movie this is.",
  "Fraser 10/10": "A required tasteI have a few likes and dislikes with this one but I'll start with the positive.Brendan Frasers performance was absolutely phenomenal, he was in 99% of the scenes and he absolutely owned each and every one. It was so emotional and heart felt, a man with absolutely nothing to his name just wants to be reassured he did one thing with his life, in retrospect he has done many many things that he may not see with his current state but how he loved his partner and had a child and many other small things make an impact.The supporting cast were good, Sadie sink was good, she has some good scenes but I love the one on one scenes between Charlie and Liz, it doesn't even feel like a movie it is just heartbreaking seeing one friend watch her friend slowly die.The pace was okay, it's not an action packed movie it's a movie about a man's final days.I wasn't too keen on the ending, it just felt like we needed another scene or 2 so we could really wrap it up.Overall a decent and moving watch, we get snippets of Charlie's past here and there which fill the emotions gage, I enjoyed it.",
  "A film that is both heartbreaking and heartwarming in equal measure": "The Whale is a film that is both heartbreaking and heartwarming in equal measure. Directed by Darren Aronofsky & starring Brendan Fraser in the lead role of Charlie, this movie explores the theme of human connection, love, & the redemption that comes with forgiveness.Charlie is a man who weighs over 600 pounds & is confined to his apartment, where he spends his days watching TV and talking to his online friends. But behind this facade lies a man who is struggling to come to terms with the loss of his partner, & who yearns for the love and acceptance of his teenage daughter Ellie, played by Sadie Sink who already proved she knows what acting actually is in popular Netflix TV series Stranger Things.What makes The Whale such a powerful film is the empathy & compassion with which it portrays its characters. Charlie is never reduced to a caricature or a punchline; instead, we see him as a complex & fully realized human being, with all the joys and sorrows that come with that. Brendan Fraser performance as Charlie is nothing short of remarkable, capturing the character's humor, vulnerability, and pain with equal skill & it is definitely a strong come back from Brenden Fraser to the silver screen.Sink is equally impressive as Ellie, bringing a raw emotional intensity to her role as a young woman struggling with her own demons. As the story unfolds, we see her begin to soften towards her father, as she comes to understand the depth of his love for her & the pain he's been through. It's a powerful and moving journey that will leave you feeling deeply moved & touched.The Whale is beautifully shot, with the cinematography capturing both the bleakness & the beauty of Charlie's world. The pacing is expertly handled, drawing the viewer in & keeping them engaged throughout. This is a film that is both tragic & hopeful, showing that even in the darkest of circumstances, there is still room for love & forgiveness.Overall, The Whale is a must-see film that will leave you with a lasting impression. It's a story about the power of human connection & the importance of forgiveness, even in the most difficult of circumstances. Aronofsky has crafted a beautiful & heartfelt film that's not to be missed.",
  "So Many": "Just as damaged, broken psychotics gushed and gushed (and identified with) Joaquin Phoenix's Joker, the grotesquely obese are gushing about Brendan Fraser's character in The Whale. You're probably fans of Lizzo too. There are so many overwrought, emotionally wounded people commenting here that I can't help but wonder how many of you had a pizza in front of you as you wrote your comments. (Did you clean your keypad?) Just remember that Brendan Fraser's character is wearing a fat suit; sadly, you aren't. He does give an award-winning performance -- and I hope he wins the Oscar -- but this film isn't for everyone. Like Joker, it's bleak, depressing, and lavishly sprinkled with heavy doses of darkness on top of darkness. And think about it: even if Charlie had found another lover who gave him a reason to live, would the lover have wanted to search for Charlie's weenie buried under all that fat? I think not.I would have given The Whale a higher rating if not for the bratty, self-pitying daughter who needs to grow up and get over herself. Also, I don't like leaving a theater feeling the need for a handful of anti-depressants or a chocolate cake with extra frosting.",
  "Not a movie I want to see again": "While Brendan Fraser's performance is excellent, he's starring in a movie with serious issues regarding both writing and acting. Sadie Sink's Ellie is strikingly one-dimensional making it impossible to feel any sympathy for her. Even Charlie's situation is the result of many bad choices and an inability to deal with his own failings. Liz, virtually his only friend, enables Charlie's suicidal habit by bringing him the very thing that is killing him. And how often do we have to see the white, male, Christian who, despite his heartfelt desire to get someone saved, has no actual understanding of what that means and fails at the very moment he should be saying, yes, God loves you, Charlie. At least his family understood the basic Christian concept of forgiveness.Nothing uplifting and generally depressing. I want more than this from a movie.",
  "This film deserves to be watched but be prepared...": "I waited a while to watch this while following it from its announcement to production. I expected a story but did not expect THIS STORY. What an EMOTIONAL movie from start to finish. The beginning was so uncomfortable and the end was so heartbreaking while the whole film feels like a cry for help while giving up at the same time.This film deserves to be watched but you will FEEL the pain from start to finish with every character that is also hurting, too. The more you watch, the deeper the cut to your emotions. There's a lot of toxicity within each character but you come out understanding why they are this way, and ultimately why there's effort in between simultaneously giving up.Be prepared going into this one because that box of tissues will be your only shoulder to cry on in the end.BRAVO TO BRENDAN FRASER!",
  "Take a moment and listen": "Ok I get it. People went to see this movie because Brendan Fraser plays a morbidly obese gay man. The shock and awe of that description alone put asses in the seats. But if you take a minute and listen...really listen and absorb what is transpiring from scene to scene, this film is so much more. A man who wants to inspire, reach out in the world from the loneliness of his couch who just wants to share love, joy and happiness. His closest friend, while an enabler of sorts, is the lifeline that keeps him going from day to day. The loneliness he endures after his partner takes his own life. His attempt to reconnect with his estranged daughter is something that hits home for me. I'm spite of how horrible she treats him, no one can convince him out of how he feels. That she is a beautiful human being. Is it wrong to continuously and relentlessly view people as beautiful creatures that only need love to endure this life? This film will hold a special place in my heart forever.",
  "Don't miss this masterpiece": "In the end of this miracle (?!! I just wanna burst into tears.I did not do it cos I was in the cinema.But the feeling u get during the watch of the movie and afterwards can't be written into words.Breathtaking.Please go to a cinema now, and watch something u will remember for many years.Brendan Fraser has a role u can't forget , and I am grateful that I saw something that lies deep in my heart and no one can ever steal it from me.Neither myself.Thank u.A really fat person stays in his house for a really long time.Has no connection to the outside world, except for the sister of his last boyfriend.Now that his daughter knocks his door he has one last chance to make something right...",
  "Breathtaking": "Everything about this movie is amazing. I've seen people saying they won't support this movie because of how against everyone is against Christianity, and I will agree that they have a right to feel that way. But, I've more people say how the movie talked about Christianity in a bad way but not in a way that would be against people's religion. The only reason they were against the missionary was because Lizzie's brother and Charlie's boyfriend Allen commited suicide because of feeling trapped by his parents for not wanting to continue. In no way was it saying that being Christian was bad or mocking their religion. Everything about this movie is amazing. The acting, the storyline, and the characters. The ending made the whole theatre cry and once its avaliable to watch for free, it'll definitely be a rewatch.",
  "A film with two clear facets.": "This is a film that has two clear facets: the high quality of the acting and the fragility of the script.It is undeniable that the work of Brendan Fraser (Charlie) places him on the Oscar route, in the same way that a couple of the supporting actors in this film (like Sadie Sink as the daughter Ellie or Hong Chau as the caretaker Liz) may also compete for this category in the next edition of the most important awards in Cinema. This is clearly the strong point of the film.But we have to be honest and recognize that not even a very competent performance by Darren Aronofsky in direction can transform the script into something it is not: a coherent story with multiple facets of interest, which intertwine harmoniously. Furthermore, this film is a rather easy exercise in building a story based on ingredients that are especially popular with contemporary audiences: the social dilemmas of gay people; the fallibility of the religious message; the roots of the dissatisfaction of the adolescent attitude; etc. Worse, by wanting to articulate in the same story such disparate elements, it ends up presenting us with a disperse narrative that doesn't really add up at the end.In any case, this is a worthwhile film that will not fall into oblivion like the vast majority of what is produced in Hollywood today.",
  "Self-destruction through Darren Aronofsky's unique vision.": "\"The Whale\" is about family, past mistakes, regret, self-destruction, and redemption.Darren Aronofsky assembles a touching and visceral experience through his narrative and visual style.The relationship between the father and daguther is similar to the sub-plot in \"The Wrestler\" (2008), and the physical and mental deterioration kind of reminds us of \"Black Swan\" (2010).Aronofsky is a master when it comes to displaying drama and tension at the same time, and in this occasion; he aims to create an atmosphere where the main character is surrounded by compassion, misery, and hope.Thus, when the ending comes, it hits you really hard.Brendon Fraser, Sadie Sink, and Hong Chau; fascinating. We can expect Brandon's Oscar, for sure... You know, Hollywood awards these kind of stories.The ending is poetic, beautiful, but very sad.\"The Whale\" is worth seeing it in the cinema. I have watched most of Aronofsky's films in the asile, and it has always been a pleasant experience.",
  "(Insert title using a pun related to obesity)": "Went to view this at Tyneside Cinema - Newcastle.An exclusive early preview!This movie is a mixed bag. Intriguing, courageous and perhaps unusual in its source material. It totally helped knowing before watching the movie that this was adapted from a play. You can really see how this would have an effect on stage.That said however, this movie felt hard to follow. Some scenes felt engaging, which you could follow with ease. Others failed and left me ending up zoning out, it felt misplaced somehow.Some characters didn't seem to work.It got messy at parts...Not to mention the soundtrack. Some really nice string arrangements that attempted to pull at the heart strings. But one section in particular which isn't really a spoiler, had trombones play while \"The Whale\" eats away at food (due to having negative feelings) . In some sort of Frankensteins monster kind of ordeal. It felt a tad insensitive and inappropriate. Didn't fit the film at all.Overall an interesting watch.You can really see that this story has a lot of heart.However, it does feel unfocused at times and messy. The audience were either laughing at fat jokes or crying due to the emotional weight of the story! Bit of a weird one. Certainly not a movie for the cinema. I'd recommend watching this one on your own in bed or something. Might get a better experience of the movie than what I did at Tyneside!",
  "A Devestating, Emotionally Draining Film With Award Worthy Performances": "Going in, I knew two things: The Whale would probably make me shed some tears and that Brendan Fraser's performance was hailed as Oscar worthy. Both turned out to be true. This is a devastating movie that turns even the simplest of tasks into heart break. It's easy to call this emotionally manipulative and I could understand the feeling.The film is almost entirely focused on Charlie, a man so obese he can't stand without the support of a walker, his breathing is labored, and he can't even laugh without nearly having a heart attack. We are seeing a man very clearly at the end of his life who has eaten himself to death. As we learn more about him and supporting characters, it's easy to see how this happened to him as it has so many others who have become negligibly obese. He has tragedy in his past, has made mistakes that haunt him, and it's clear that he probably doesn't even really want to live anymore. What makes it more devastating is that he's a genuinely good guy who sees a lot of good in the world and loves people.The almost suffocating tragedy of the film makes it come across as something so dour, so purposefully written with overwhelming sadness that you can't help but feel that it's meant to pull at the heartstrings and tears of it's audience. But it's also very reflective and considerate. Fraser's Charlie is not unrealistic or a caricature. He feels genuinely human and it's easy to relate to him. This is primarily due to the fact that he's not crafted as a monster or a depressive. He's portrayed as someone who laughs, smiles, takes joy in aspects of life, who regrets, but most of all, loves. It's clear that it is love that put him on the road that is killing him and it is love that ultimately keeps him on this road, despite pleas to go to the hospital and save himself from his one friend, his caretaker played in what is almost as good a job as Fraser by Hong Chau. She has my vote for a best supporting actress nom.The film takes place entirely in one location and Aronofsky makes the most of it, whether it's the dramatic scenes wonderfully acted or the focus on things with deeper meaning to the Charlie. Even the lighting has wonderfully dramatic variation, from moody darkness to bright, hopeful light. This singular location requires much of it's audience, a tolerance for the kind of pain we see on screen. As mentioned, everything that might typically be taken for granted, that we might not notice, gets a spotlight here. Whether it's watching Charlie gut wrenchingly continue to devour what is killing him, like two large pizzas and a bucket of fried chicken, or watching him struggle to get into bed, it all feels like an invisible timer ticking down. It feels like every aspect of the location, every movement within, every sound, is done with purpose.Supporting performances beyond Chau, though limited, are also fantastic, namely Sadie Sink as Charlie's daughter. Her cruelty and anger are played up here, and it's easy to dismiss her as almost villainous, but she's also relatable. She no doubt does and says things that might anger us, but it's also easy to recognize where it comes from and what's driven her to become this person, and to also see who she really is underneath. Sadie, coming fresh off her head turning performance in season 4 of Stranger Things, once again shows just how powerful of an actress she can be and how, if given the chance, she will become a star in her own right. She manages to balance out the emotional range of her character, making it look easy and if her character doesn't break your heart as much as watching Charlie has, I don't know that you can consider yourself human.The Whale may be a movie that is too tough for people to get through. It's rarely ever joyful and moments of levity, if the exist, are brief. This is a story about a man who has missed a chance to pull back from the cliff he's brought himself too and we're on a journey of, essentially, watching him try to fulfill his final desires for those few people in his life that he loves. He's clearly a good man people want to save, but who we all realize that it would take a miracle to bring him back. I certainly cried a few times and never once felt manipulated to do so. If anything, this is a movie worth seeing for what is arguably Brendan Fraser's best performance ever.",
  "Brendan Fraser Returns With A Tour-De-Force Act": "Navigating shame, guilt, religion, sexuality, rage, remorse, forgiveness & reconciliation with the tools of empathy & compassion, The Whale is a powerful, moving & emotionally heartbreaking psychological drama that's greatly elevated by outstanding performances from the entire cast, with Brendan Fraser's career-best showcase in his comeback role being its main highlight.Directed by Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler & Mother!), the story follows a broken, reclusive & morbidly obese man's last attempt at redemption by reconnecting with his estranged teenage daughter and is told with honesty & tenderness. Still, the director's approach & execution isn't going to strike the right chord with everyone, for some will find it a tad mawkish & problematic.Unfolding entirely inside the protagonist's apartment, the drama is gripping throughout and is expertly shot & interestingly told. But it's the first-rate work from the ensemble here that does the heavy lifting. Brendan Fraser returns with a tour-de-force act to steal the show but strong support from Hong Chau, Sadie Sink & Samantha Morton are also notable, each bringing more depth to their roles.Overall, The Whale manages to be as hopeful & heartfelt as it is haunting & harrowing at times and marks yet another polarising entry in Aronofksy's oeuvre despite being his warmest film to date. Featuring one of the most accurate depictions of binge eating episode, anchored by top-notch acting and complemented by an evocative score, Darren Aronofksy's latest is one of the better films of 2022. A definite recommend.",
  "Brendan Fraser Swims Like A Whale In The Ocean Of Emotions": "The Whale (2022) :\nMovie Review -Darren Aronofsky takes handsome hunk Brendan Fraser to portray a 600-pound obese man in his psychological emotional drama, \"The Whale\". Based on the 2012 play of the same name, The Whale is a family drama that is conquered by its premises, emotions, and characters. You don't have to just watch it, but feel it. We have been getting films about man/woman in trouble with some disease, obscenity, or something like that since the talkies began in the 1930s. First it was a woman or man with cancer, then it became a tumour, then an abnormal character, then a mute/deaf or blind person, and finally it became euthanasia. The Whale brings an overweight man's life to the screen, but unlike other emotional dramas, it does not try to emphasise his character. It keeps him like a normal man, who is stubborn and has so many faults in him, but still, you are carried away by him in the end.The Whale is about Charlie (Brendan Fraser), a reclusive Idaho-based English teacher who never leaves his apartment due to severe obesity. He has online teaching classes but keeps his webcam off to hide his morbidity. He is taken care of by his friend, Liz (Hong Chau), who is a nurse and his only friend at the moment. Liz tells him to visit a hospital for a severe risk of congestive heart failure, which Charlie refuses. Even when she tells him that he is soon going to die, Charlie refuses to go to the hospital. He is visited by Thomas (Ty Simpkins), who claims that he is a missionary and that reading the Bible might help Charlie in his last moments. Charlie then decides to reconnect with his estranged daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), by offering her the sum of $120, 000 from his bank account. Ellie starts visiting her father, but she is not a decent girl at all. Will Charlie manage to make her good, and will she accept her father, who left her at the age of 8?The Whale has a funny title for the kind of emotional and psychological narrative it has. You'll learn the reasons behind that in the film, though. The Whale proves how an essay could be used so well and so metaphorically. One more thing is that it doesn't try to be a film full of positivity and good people. We actually love such surroundings, but here they make us realise that not all problematic people have to be helpless and sympathetic. Charlie's homosexuality, Liz's abusive nature and words, Thomas' true colors, and Ellie's evil persona-these are the things that make you believe in the negativity that we have around us. You might hate the characters and the film for that (even I did), but to be honest, it's hard to always find good people around you. They must be cruel in order for us to feel reality. The screenplay is a little slow in the middle, and all those not-so-nice people make you lose interest for a while, but The Whale covers the loss in the climax.The handsome Brandan Fraser of The Mummy (1999) will always remain a part of my childhood memories, but his best performances came in \"Still Breathing\" and \"Crash,\" which aren't that popular. Now, he has won the most number of awards of any film in his career with \"The Whale,\" and I don't wonder why. It's not just about the prosthetics and physical challenges he might have faced or even the kind of dedication he showed, but it's about getting everything right in one of the most challenging portrayals ever. He is just superb in every scene, but then there is that conversation scene in the climax that takes it to another level. Keep the Best Actor trophies coming. Hong Chau is equally good in the best supporting role in this film. Sadie Sink is beautiful yet brutal and raw, Ty Simpkins is decent, and Samantha Marton shines brightly in that one single long scene.The Whale has a heart-touching background score and fantastic cinematography. The dialogues are vulgar and scurrilous as per the situations. I hated some of them for being overly abusive, but what to do if the anger and nature of the characters demanded that they be so? Charlie is a complex character; actually, all of them are. Everyone has some issues with their lives; nobody is just plain happy. Moreover, things like homosexuality, religious guilt, and marijuana make it more unfriendly, but that's what defined The Whale to its core. However weird that ending looked, it's just about your perspective on looking at it. Darren Aronofsky navigates this emotional ocean without disturbing the other sleeping fish. We all have brains, so it's obvious and easy to find out the mistakes, and it's necessary too, but then, we all have hearts too, which is where this film wins. Wetting a couple of tissues at the end of the film is always an engrossing experience, and The Whale gives you that, along with the best performance of Brandan Fraser's career so far.RATING - 7/10*",
  "Gee Louise! The (ONCE) great director Darren Aronofsky has become a HAS BEEN...": "Wow. In a bad way... this is definitely (one of) the most overrated movies of 2022.What the heck was all this talk about this actor being terrific? I get it, this actor looks impressevely overweight, but THAT IS NOT an acting skill that has to be awarded in ANY way. Perhaps for the special effects or makeup department....The bad: this movie starts out with an obese man masturbating to gay porn online. That's just a cheap corny opening. You better get your story and your characters EXACTLY right (and sympathetic) WHEN you deicde to open your movie so cheaply like that. And director Darren Aronofsky failed big time at making believable and likeable characters.More bad: the supporting actors are terrible. The photography is dull. There is no spark or punch. This is a NOTHING burger!There is basically no storyline, besides a contineous indulgence in depressing nothingness. What a BORE of a movie!How this movie ever made it to the cinemas is beyond me. DEFINITELY recommended to AVOID.Not any good then at ALL? NO.Better watch any of the old movies by the ONCE great director Darren Aronofsky (12 years before), THOSE were the days that this director SHINED and made some terrific classics. But with The Whale he messed up big time!",
  "Very dark": "This movie will indeed not be for everyone. It is moody, dark, depressing, and above all else it is full of sadness. The movie is full of metaphors that you can discover and that is neat for a film person like myself and someone who likes to look deeply at a film. You don't have to know any of that to enjoy the movie. I say enjoy because I don't have any other words for it. My wife and I liked the movie very much. We did not enjoy what we saw. I feel like we more or less ingested what was given and the experience of what we were able to feel is what we liked. We did not really speak until we were halfway home because we were digesting what we had seen. I am in love with movies, she on the other hand likes them but never goes to a movie. I would recommended this to everyone and no one all at the same time. Make sure you are ready for some emotional content when you see it.",
  "A bleak and powerful portrait of human suffering": "The Whale is a psychological drama about a morbidly obese English teacher who tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter. The film is based on a play by Samuel D. Hunter and stars Brendan Fraser, Sadie Sink, Hong Chau, Ty Simpkins, and Samantha Morton. The film explores themes of loneliness, guilt, forgiveness, and redemption through the characters' complex relationships and emotions. The film is directed by Darren Aronofsky, who is known for his dark and provocative films such as Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan, and mother.I was impressed by this film. I thought it was a brave and honest depiction of human suffering and resilience. I was moved by the performance of Fraser, who transformed himself physically and emotionally for the role. He portrayed his character with dignity and vulnerability. I also liked the performance of Sink, who played his rebellious and angry daughter with nuance and intensity. I thought the film was well-written and directed. It had a realistic and intimate tone that made me feel immersed in the story. The film did not shy away from showing the harsh realities of obesity, such as health problems, social stigma, and self-loathing. The film also showed glimpses of hope and humor that balanced out the bleakness. The film made me think about the meaning of life, love, and family.",
  "A deep and painful look at unhealed trauma": "I walked away with the message that we all carry unprocessed trauma and it shows in different ways. The main character, Charlie, is has a challenging relationship with food and has put on weight to the extent that it has created limitations in every part of his life. The weight of his trauma is literally visible to everyone. The rest of the cast carries on this theme, and even though their traumas are just as big as Charlie's they carry it differently and have no problem telling Charlie that he should get help but have blind spots when it comes to their own coping mechanisms. The film depicts trauma manifesting as alcoholism, anger, people-pleasing, self-neglect, depression and suicide.",
  "Brendan Fraser as you've never seen him before": "First of all, I've been a fan of Brendan Frasier since the 90's. I always felt his acting chops were underutilized in some of the movies he did, but this was just...it's hard to come up with the words. This was the most emotionally dedicated performance I've seen from an actor in many, many years and showcases Fraser's immense and expansive acting abilities.I know he was rejected from Hollywood because of accusations he made against someone, and I find that shameful. To see him come back like this...in this role...the way he did makes my heart incredibly happy! Not many actors could pull of a roll like this, but Brendan Fraser managed it...and managed it beautifully!I am very in touch with people who are bullied and people who feel hopeless/helpless, so needless to say, this movie tore my heart and I left the theater in tears.Fraser's emotionally charged scenes with the actress who played his daughter...his vulnerability and willingness to go so far as to pay her to spend time with him was incredible. It was raw, open, and painful. Charlie possess something few people have these days...humanity. He made mistakes in his relationship with his daughter and was completely forgiving of her terrible behavior...even when she drugged him. The scenes with his helper and his ex-wife were explicitly and painfully executed. The pain that this family felt at the disintegration of their relationships was raw and it was real. Fraser's facial expressions and delivery of his lines only heightened the emotional pull.Over all, it was absolutely fantastic. Welcome back, Brendan Fraser!!",
  "Award Worthy But Weird Ending": "I saw The Whale, starring Brendan Fraser-Doom Patrol_tv, Sadie Sink-Stranger Things_tv, American Odyssey_tv; Hong Chau-The Menu, Homecoming_tv and Samantha Morton-The Walking Dead_tv, Minority Report.This is an actors' comeback-as if he really ever left-that is based on a play. Brendan plays a man that left his family-wife & 8 year old daughter-for someone else. After a tragic incident, Brendan tries to cope by over eating-pizza is one of his favorite foods to order. He is an English teacher and does his classes using his computer. He disconnects the camera so they can not see him and tells them it is broken-he can still see them. Sadie is Brendan's daughter and Samantha is his ex wife. Hong plays the sister of Brendan's lover and she helps take care of Brendan, since he never leaves his house. Brendan wants to reconnect with his daughter but she is not as receptive to it as he would want her to be. Hong, Sadie and even Samantha try to get Brendan to go to the hospital-he has plenty of money-but he has his own plans for the money. The make up is outstanding and I'm sure Brendan's name will come up during Oscar time but the one thing I didn't care for was the ending. It is one of those that leave you hanging and you have to interpret it for yourself, as to what happens.It's rated R for language, drug use and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright to stream.",
  "A harrowing, depressing, yet highly involving story of one man's attempt to fix most of the problems in his life": "\"The Whale\" is a drama film directed by Darren Aronofsky (\"Requiem for a Dream\", \"The Wrestler\", \"Black Swan\") based on the play of the same name by Samuel D. Hunter. Starring Brendan Fraser, Hong Chau, and Sadie Sink, it is a harrowing, depressing, yet highly involving story of one man's attempt to fix most of the problems in his life.In New York state, the morbidly obese Charlie (Brendan Fraser) lives in a small, dingy apartment where he works as a college English professor teaching his students online via Zoom. Charlie's only proper friend is his nurse Liz (Hong Chau), who frequently urges him to seek medical attention but her pleas always fall on deaf ears due to his fear of being unable to afford health insurance. As his physical and mental state worsens, Charlie decides to reconnect with his estranged teenaged daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink), which proves difficult because the two have not interacted in over eight years. After some convincing, Ellie reluctantly agrees to spend time with her father, on the condition that he helps her write an essay for high school.It's common knowledge that the increasing rate of obesity is a serious issue in almost every country in the developed world. To discuss all the factors that contribute to this epidemic would take far too long but the best-known ones include a poor diet and/or lack of exercise. As a formerly overweight person myself, I can say first hand that it is not a pleasant experience to live this way, which is why I found it necessary to work towards becoming a healthier person. Here in Darren Aronofksy's film \"The Whale\", we are shown the devastating consequences of a man's obese lifestyle and how it has affected everyone around him.What surprised me the most about this film was how much effort was put into developing Charlie as a human being rather than a cheap caricature of an obese person. We are shown that beyond his large, shapely exterior is actually a highly articulate intellectual whose past choices and insecurities are what led him down this dark path of poor health. In spite of his condition, Charlie is still able to give competent online lectures about world literature, albeit, with his webcam turned off out of fear for what the students might think of his appearance. If it weren't for his sedentary lifestyle, Charlie could easily be seen lecturing at a university on a podium like a regular scholar, sharing his vast knowledge with anyone fortunate enough to listen.There are also many opportunities where the film could have made us want to straight up hate Charlie for all his misdeeds, but instead it takes a more balanced approach. For all the bad things he has done, we see that Charlie deeply regrets the pain he has inflicted on others and tries his best to correct it. However, when it comes to himself, he uses a much more self-destructive method. Almost as a twisted means of punishing himself, Charlie continues to binge-eat and reject all hospital care to the point where his physical state can only get worse. It is here where the tragic element of Charlie's character works in the film's favour, because if we never saw this sad side of his personality, it would be near impossible to feel any sympathy towards him at all.Returning after a five-year hiatus, Darren Aronofsky injects most of his directorial trademarks into nearly every frame. His creative use of close-ups at times where you may not expect it certainly helps emphasise the world in which Charlie lives. For example, in one scene set during an online class, the camera slowly zooms into the dark square in the middle of the screen where Charlie's icon is located, which is intended to represent a deep descent into the depths of Charlie's sub conscience and the mystery of how he must look to his students. This can also be viewed as like diving deep into the ocean where a whale may finds its home, which is as dark and mysterious as Charlie himself.Additionally, Aronofsky illustrates the terrible state of America's healthcare system by showing that it is essentially cheaper for Charlie to continue living an obese lifestyle at home rather than seeking external medical help. To show this, he uses muted colours to illuminate the inside of Charlie's apartment. Despite being shown to have adequate lighting, Charlie's living quarters never look bright or vibrant, except whenever the front door is opened. At no point do we ever feel like Charlie enjoys living here, but considering his physical condition, it's not like he has much other choice as to where else he can go aside from the hospital. I interpret this as Aronofsky showing the audience that no matter where Charlie ends up, he will always be in a dark place, both literally and metaphorically.After dropping off the radar for sometime, it is wonderful to see Brendan Fraser return to the big screen in what can only be described as the greatest performance he will likely ever give. There wasn't a single moment where I didn't feel utterly absorbed by the way Fraser played into everything about Charlie as a character, from his intelligent side to his remorseful nature. Fraser essentially depicts Charlie as an addict, not to drugs but to unhealthy foods. Scenes where he is conflicted over devouring an entire chocolate bar are conveyed with so much emotion that it is comparable to watching heroin addicts try to resist the urge to inject themselves with another shot. I honestly cannot imagine any other actor playing this role except for Fraser, and to say he simply did a great job feels like I'm underselling it.The film also benefits from its supporting cast, in particular Hong Chau as Liz and Sadie Sink as Ellie. Liz is shown to be Charlie's only real connection to the outside world, providing him with the food he requests as well as someone to talk to. Chau succeeds at making the audience feel sympathetic towards Liz for everything she puts up with to take care of her friend, but at the same time it is somewhat annoying to see that she is doing little else to stop him from potentially eating himself to death. Charlie's daughter Ellie harbours nothing but contempt for her father, which is understandable considering he was the one who abandoned her at a time when she needed him the most. Sadie Sink was a solid choice for this role, because she has proven to be good at playing characters who are conflicted over where her allegiance lies, and this one is no exception.In this world full of leering eyes and judgemental attitudes, a film like \"The Whale\" shows that while it's easy to judge someone by their appearance, it never hurts to show a little empathy from time to time. Everyone is fighting their own battles and not everyone is at a point where it looks like they'll win out in the end. Though this is far from a happy story, I believe that it is still necessary for us to properly understand somebody's pain from their perspective in order to become a better person as a result. For those reasons alone, this film leaves its desired impact.I rate it a solid 9/10.",
  "Brendan Fraser enters Darren Aronofsky's world of metaphors! [+70%]": "First off, credit where it's fittingly due.. I DID NOT see Brendan Fraser in this film. I could only see a severely obese man named Charlie. What a comeback performance! Gut-wrenching, heartfelt, and so internally painful. The man deserves all the accolades he's getting (and more!). The Whale also features some of the best prosthetic work you'll see, at least in recent times. Playwright Samuel D. Hunter pens a script that instantly sucks you into the reclusive world of Charlie, an online English tutor with a wrecked personal life. Not only does the Academy ratio catch your eye from the very first shot (of an ongoing online class), but it also metaphorically shrinks the world of Charlie into something more confined.Charlie's obesity struggles are poignantly portrayed, and director Darren Aronofsky paints his surroundings in dark tones, accentuated by the non-stop rains, unkempt bedrooms, and carb-saturated cabinets. The only person who honestly cares for Charlie is Liz (a terrific Hong Chau), and while she repeatedly tells him to secure better treatment, Charlie has no absolutely no such intention. The reason for this is elaborated over the week's proceedings, with his estranged daughter and wife showing up at his place in hauntingly dramatic scenes. The daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink) occupies a more prominent presence, visiting him with motives that slowly get revealed. Samantha Morton plays the wife, and she delivers a memorable performance in those few scenes.The eating disorder scenes, clearly meant to turn you off, make you want to stay off that pepperoni pizza for a while. But at the core, it's also upsetting as hell, when you cannot help but think whether Charlie will drop dead any second. The constant wheezing and struggle to get off the couch are heavily punctuated by Rob Simonsen's evocative score - only Charlie's eyes remain optimistic throughout. The themes of guilt, loss, and religion are brought to the forefront, and Aronofsky as expected, is instrumental in executing the misery of it all to disconcerting effect. From a storytelling standpoint, I did wish the relationship between Charlie and his dead lover was charted out better, especially since that's pinned as the root cause for the former's suffering. The Whale will simultaneously leave you dismayed and relieved by its climax, even though it's predictable.",
  "Whale that was good": "Brendan Fraser shows he's a masterclass and an A list actor once again. My partner found the story a little boring but there was a lot of layer to peel back to realize it's a fine story. I truly felt like I was watching a man's life story told in a few short final days of his life. There's not a lot of subtly to the symbolism but they don't beat you over the head with it. The dreary lighting in his apartment sets the tone right from the start. I highly recommend putting the phone down and paying attention to this movie. Even the parts that tend to drag on serve a purpose. Yes it's a long movie that never leaves an apartment, but it helps you understand what true depression is. Dylan has people that care for him and he's only stuck living in the past.",
  "Fraser is fantastic, the movie - not so much": "Actor showcases can come in many forms, but, none as basic as a filmed play. Even more so when it's all staged on one set as in Darren Aronofsky's THE WHALE (adapted by Samuel D. Hunter himself).Charlie (Brendan Fraser) is a teacher who has essentially given up on living a productive life. He's shut himself off inside a dank and cluttered Idaho apartment and eaten himself into morbid obesity. He teaches an online writing course and has all his food delivered. Conscious of his appearance, he doesn't allow his students or delivery man to see him. His only friend is a nurse, Liz (Hong Chau) who tries her best to check on his health, but it's more of a tough-love relationship. Charlie is bitterly divorced and estranged from his wife (Samantha Morton) and daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink). The only other visitor is Thomas (Ty Simpkins), a Missionary who takes it upon himself to \"save\" Charlie with God.Aronofsky is known for his visuals, so it is interesting that he would take on a project where those powers are so minimized. Matthew Libatique frames his cinematography in the classic 1:33 aspect ratio to emphasize the claustrophobic nature of Charlie's existence. He gets up from the couch only a couple of times, and Aronofsky gives full prominence to the convincing latex prosthetics that Adrien Morot and his team created.Hunter's screenplay isn't truly interested in Charlie's obesity per se. It's treated more as a symptom of his mental state than as the cause. Melville's Moby Dick is cited as a symbol of how the characters interact (and every high school English student knows what the alternate title of the novel is, of course). It's a dark and depressing tale, which does fit the Aronofsky mold. Rob Simonsen's score wouldn't be out of place in a Blumhouse horror film. It would all be an unbearable wallow if it were not for Fraser.Despite the funereal atmosphere, the actor manages to make Charlie fully human. He gives the sense that he really was a functioning man at one point. There is a glimmer of life somewhere deep inside. A sparkle in his eyes when something touches his soul. It's a remarkable performance. Chau brings a few moments of dark humor to the proceedings and Sink and Simpkins do what they can with highly stagy roles; even the usually exemplary Morton gets saddled with a thankless ex-wife part. In Aronofsky's vision there truly can be only room for Fraser to shine, and he certainly does; Whether that is enough will be up to the individual viewer.",
  "Interesting if flawed": "This is an interesting, if somewhat perplexing and slow-moving film.The main character appears to be trying to eat himself to death. As the story goes along, more characters are introduced and there are some surprises. The grief and guilt underlying the main character's death-by-calories behavior becomes more apparent and understandable. However, despite Brendan Fraser's phenomenal performance, I wasn't sure I found his character believable.The tie-in with Melville's novel was the most interesting part of the film. The ending was somewhat abrupt, however, and I would have liked to hear more of what the Sadie Sink character had been thinking.Overall, this film is worth seeing for the performances, and because it's not usual Hollywood fare.",
  "The Whale Flounders Through an Obvious Moby Dick Metaphor": "Hey, Streamers! I hope you had a good holiday and you're ready for some more awards hopefuls. I was able to get to a theater to catch The Whale. I've been hearing a lot about an awards-worthy performance and comeback from everyone's favorite man from Encino, Brendan Fraser. Here's whether the performance and the movie around it live up to the hype. (Spoiler Alert: It doesn't)Darren Aronofsky (Black Swan, Requiem for a Dream) directed the The Whale, which is based on a play by the same person who wrote the screenplay, Samuel D. Hunter. Brendan Fraser plays Charlie, a 600-pound man who is attempting to reconnect with his estranged daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), in his final week of life. Charlie has one friend, Liz (Hong Chau), who provides some care for him but she also enables his worst impulses at times. Other characters pop in and out of Charlie's cloistered apartment as he fumbles through teaching an online writing course while binge-eating himself to death. A barrel of laughs ensues, he said sarcastically.The Whale desperately wants to be a tearjerker. Charlie is set up as a tragic figure, and the movie tells the audience that Charlie knocking on deaths door. Everything about this character says pity this man. The problem is that the movie is so overwrought that it leads towards the comical. The worst offense is the poor makeup job and fat suit that Brendan Fraser is encased it. On top of that, Brendan Fraser is doing the absolute most - and not in a good way - with his performance. He desperately wants that Oscar with the way he screams and cries throughout this melodramatic bore. Also, there is a bad performance by Sadie Sink as the angsty teenager. She is the worst person in the world, and Sink does nothing to humanize her. Both Charlie and Ellie become caricatures, which is ultimately very tiresome and off-putting.There really isn't much else to The Whale. It is a movie that is very obviously based on a play since it is stuck in one location and characters come in and out of the scene. This material may work better on the stage than on the big screen, but the screenplay is pretty bad. The obvious metaphor with Moby Dick, which Charlie references constantly throughout, is so annoying that if you are not rolling your eyes by the end then you are better than me.The one saving grace is that Hong Chau shows up every now and then and does her best to bring some real life to the film. In the scenes with Chau and Fraser, there is good chemistry, and there is a glimpse of the heartfelt and sensitive film that could have been.Ultimately, The Whale is extremely melodramatic. Fraser goes for every Oscar clip he can and only lands a few when Chau is around. The fat suit is off-putting and Sadie Sink is bad throughout the movie. There is a small speck of a decent idea here, but not enough to make a trip to the theater worthwhile. Stream if bored, at best. One popped kernel.",
  "Brendan deserves an Oscar": "Brendan Fraser and Hong Chau deliver truly outstanding performances in the 2022 movie \"The Whale\". Their portrayal of complex and deeply troubled characters is nothing short of remarkable.Fraser plays Charlie, a 600-pound man who is trapped both physically and emotionally by his own body. Despite his immense size, Fraser manages to imbue Charlie with a sense of vulnerability and tenderness that makes him a deeply sympathetic character. Throughout the film, Fraser skillfully conveys the agony of Charlie's physical pain and the depths of his despair, while also infusing the character with moments of humor and warmth.Hong Chau, meanwhile, delivers an equally impressive performance as the young and somewhat mysterious Liz. Chau brings a quiet intensity to the role, playing Liz as someone who is simultaneously guarded and deeply compassionate. She has a natural chemistry with Fraser, and the two actors play off each other beautifully, creating a sense of intimacy and connection that is both heartbreaking and uplifting.Together, Fraser and Chau make \"The Whale\" an emotionally rich and profoundly moving film. Their performances are not only masterful but also deeply affecting, making the audience feel every moment of their characters' pain and struggle. They truly embody the essence of what it means to be an actor, and their work in this film is nothing short of extraordinary.In short, Brendan Fraser and Hong Chau are both incredible in \"The Whale\". Their performances are powerful, nuanced, and deeply moving, and they make the film an unforgettable cinematic experience. Anyone who loves great acting and compelling storytelling will not want to miss this masterpiece.",
  "The Road to redemption - Aronofsky's way": "I always liked Brendan Fraser, and always thought he was not getting the recognition he deserved for his talent. It was probably due to the ease in which he seemed to carry his roles, and the fact he never looked like he was taking himself seriously (or anything else). In fact, for me that was his most endearing quality. Most of all I missed his lighthearted action comedies and I always thought there was a sharp brain behind all his charm. So obviously I had to check this movie out:You can check me out on this page - I don't rate movies 10 stars often. Even 9 stars don't come so easily from me, even though I mainly go to movies I believe I'm going to like, and I do research them before I decide to watch any. The reason I rated this movie 10 stars is because for me it's a perfect combination of all the components of movie making. The acting is superb, and Brendan Fraser is topping the list with the performance of his life. But none in this movie is missing a single note they're all like a well-trained orchestra. Sadie Sink is amazing as the daughter who can't forget or forgive. Hong Chau is impressive as the nurse who tries to atone for the sins of her father. And I could go on without a single bad word.But that doesn't sum up this movie. The camera works wonders, Matthew Libatique, Aronofsky's regular cinematographer deserves the credit in this case. The lighting is simply mesmerizing, think about the suffocating feel you get from the dark claustrophobic house in which this movie takes place - almost theatrical, maintaining the three unities, almost to the letter. Think about how every outdoor shot is there just so the inside of the house feels more tomb like. And think about the script or more precisely - the plot. A story about an obsessive search for redemption that leads to destruction as part of the redemption Charlie is so desperately looking for and about the weird role religion plays in this search for redemption. In fact, it's here only so we can see that it's not the road to redemption. It's here just so we can see what road Charlie chooses, when he could've taken the religious road.One more point - think about Moby Dick, think about Ahab's final scene and think about the reason this movie got this name. It's not just because of Charlie's size.I don't often find such a perfect combination of what I think should make a movie, I found it all in this movie. It wasn't an easy watch, but it was worth every single second.",
  "An Emotional Rollercoaster!": "What an amazing & emotionally filled acting by all actors..! Especially, by the main character..(Brendan Fraser) had me on the verge of tearing up throughout the whole film & at the end... It was like crying for the first time..! So much passionate & empathetic tones that I couldn't keep up the tissues in o wipe the tears.. I give it a 10 & still hits me thinning about it.. This will be a movie for the ages& will stay with you & hopefully taught you something about Loving unconditionally no matter who we are or think we've become..! I can't think of another movie that brings this very important message to the big screen.. I 1000% recommend everyone watch this but especially all the father's with kids..! Thank you Mr. Farser for continuing to give memories that will last a lifetime..!",
  "Great. But not an 'Easy Watch'.": "Daren Aronofsky's 'The Whale' is not an easy watch. There were several times that I was forced to look away from the screen. So sad and horrifying was Brendan Fraser's Charlie, particularly when attempting to raise his six hundred pounds from a chair, or walk, or shower, or use his toilet. Despite my personal discomfort with the character, the picture has much to say about our society, and says it excellently. Whether or not the viewer has suffered the kind of physical or emotional distress suffered by Charlie, there is much to relate to, much about which to say 'Yes, I know'.Charlie is a complex man. He fathered a child whom he left when she was eight. He had a gay love affair with a young man whose death has contributed mightily to Charlie's obesity. Charlie has secrets that he has kept from both family and friends, some of which, during the course of his week, will test those relationships. Early on we are told that Charlie is in need of hospitalization or we will die. And when Charlie turns down that treatment (several times) we realize that for this film a happy ending is not in the cards. And, more important, Charlie knows it.And knowing his time is limited Charlie spends much of his week looking back on his life, trying to come to terms with the bad he has done, the losses he has suffered. Looking, searching for something of value that he might have contributed to this world. And it is during this week that he is visited by the wife and child he abandoned, the sister of the young man he loved, and a young man - like Charlie's dead lover - who has joined a Christian Cult and claims to have the life-answers for Charlie.Brendan Fraser is extraordinary as Charlie. The doleful eyes, the straining of his body to move, the stress bottled-up and ready to combust. As his daughter, Sadie Sink is hateful and, as such, perfect. She is the daughter from hell, the character for whom nothing is too hurtful to be voiced. Samantha Morton as her mother - and Charlie's ex - is wonderful as a woman struggling between hate for this man who deserted her, and pity for his current state. Equally important is that the viewer easily believes that their daughter is, in fact, the offspring that the two of them have produced.I saw the film in order to view Fraser's (likely) Award Winning Performance. But it was the film as a whole that grabbed me, that held me in its grip. Though, again, easy it was not.",
  "Coincidence or not?": "It is not a bad movie but slightly overrated. Of course it has a great acting by Brendan Fraser but all together it was a bit too much suffering for two hours.But I kind of like Brendan Fraser so I watched it until its end.One interesting aspect I find was and would be curious to know the possible level of parallelism between Fraser's personal life and this movie as there seems to be interesting analogies between how Fraser lived, we read about him and how Charlie's life happened like homosexualism, divorce, life without children, total fall, obesity, etc.Was he playing out his personal life experience in this movie? Who knows?Anyway, I'm eager to see more new movies with him on the screen. It can be drama if it has to but..",
  "Superb Work From Brendan Fraser": "The Whale is a fantastic story to tell and this movie lives up to the hype. Darren Aronofsky keeps things simple and directs it just like the stage show with the majority of the film set in Charlie's home.The cast are all fantastic with Brendan Fraser & Hong Chau in awards contention and Sadie Sink showing she is an actress to watch in the future. Samantha Morton turns up towards the end and does what Morton tends to do and that's almost steal the full movie with little screen time, she is great.Released in the UK in February the Whale has been doing the festival circuit since last August and i think some may be getting fed up hearing about it and have turned against the movie as the reactions to it have dipped a bit in recent months. It is a shame as The Whale deserves to be recognised for not only being a superb vehicle for Fraser, but as a great film in itself.",
  "The acting and actors got this up to a 6. The story is just meh.": "I totally agree with everything everyone else is saying about Brendan Fraser. He is a very talented actor who had been overlooked for many years. After his \"leading man\" good looks faded Hollywood threw him away, because that's what Hollywood does. I watched this because I liked every actor in it, even the guy who played the pizza delivery guy. As a fan of \"Stranger Things,\" I was excited to see Sadie Sink, but her character is just awful...but played well by Sadie.The story had a lot of potential, but sort of got confusing about the Charlie character and his internal feeling about his daughter. It may have translated well in the written word, but doesn't make it all the way in the movie. I wasn't entertained by the story, nothing done was redemptive, except maybe the daughter character but it wasn't with the tone of the rest of the movie. The backstory about the relationship between Charlie and his X wife isn't fleshed out, (but Samatha Morton breathed life into an otherwise earful character) the relationship between Charlie and his dead ex isn't fully fleshed out although we got to see the acting chops of Hong Chau who carried the character into interesting territory (the story did not.)\nSadie Sink's character is just terrible. She clearly did the best she could with mushy materiel. I didn't get why the father kept gushing over her, she was awful to him and everyone else. She continued to be a terrible, pissy teen, and I think at that age I general, she may have hit the mail on the head but it didn't cause the story to merge like I wanted it to. The story I like 7 different stories that don't quite fit together nicely or at all. The missionary character could have been left completely out and the pizza delivery guy could have been explored with far more interest.Bottom line, watch this movie, make your own conclusion as that others really had an emotional response to it. You may too and may also find the story more cohesive than I did.",
  "Should get in to the \"movies you have to see before you die\" list": "For some reason this movie in Greece is rated by critics 1,5/5 \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. Don't always trust the critics. This movie was one of the best I'd seen in the last decade. Everyone who worked in the movie delivered an excellent result. Remember to bring at least a pack or two of tissues and good company cause the sensitive ones we had it going good for the most part of the movie. This is also the first time I'm writing a review for a movie so it was that good ! Truly it is one of those movies that change your way of thinking for the better, that being said if you hear the words \"fat & religion\" from someone criticizing this movie and you didn't even think of these words you know where you stand.",
  "Pretty good": "Went to see \"the Whale\" just to see Brendan Frasers amazing transformation as the main character. And his performance in the movie is ace. As you've probably seen from the trailer.The story of the movie starts off decent too. Basically showing his character trying to redeem himself for previous mistakes before the inevitable finally catches up with him. I didn't like the overall message of the movie though, and wasn't sure about some of the grosser scenes, or how to take the arc of his daughter. Who was way too much of an annoying brat throughout.Still, its all set in one flat and showcases great acting all round if that's your thing, and the ending is as emotional as you'd imagine.",
  "I cried not at all": "Dont know why I would! The behaviour of the daughter going through a teenage crisis was just crazy. The whake himself was just so fictional I couldnt fall for it even if I tried. The big heart in the huge body. I was actually disgusted. Thought about eating a cake but couldnt watching this movie. So in that case its good cause it might help someone choose another direction when it comes to eating too much junk. Overall this wasnt at all appealing to me in any way. Rather pathetic. Not a good 2 hour waste either. Lost half a day watching this.There is nothing remotely emotional about this other than disgust and pity. And I am a really emotional person otherwise when it comes to someone (usually animals) in need, suffering or pain.",
  "Absolutely Speechless!": "This is probably the best movie I've ever watched, and I cannot imagine every award not going to everyone here, especially Brendan. Probably the best performance of his career. He needs no attestation, but this performance just proved how brilliant he is as an actor. I felt every dialogue, emotion, pain etc., pierce through my heart. It was so real that I felt I was there, living through every moment.If this movie and its cast doesn't win awards for the best in everything, I no longer believe in the entire award system, period! Hands down the best movie I've seen in a while. I cannot write anymore as I'm left speechless. Thank you for a wonderful movie, and a performance of a lifetime.All I can say to those who are thinking to watch this - JUST WATCH IT!",
  "Brendan Fraser and Hong Chau are amazing": "A magnificent return from Brendan Fraser! He gives a phenomenal performance as Charlie that shows the grief, pain and yet the positivity of his morbidly obese character that makes him more complex. Hong Chau is also terrific as the nurse Liz. She gives a performance that illustrates the struggle and pain of someone watching their friend self-destruct.I love the use of a 4:3 aspect ratio to really capture the claustrophobic nature of the apartment and to illustrate the obesity as Charlie takes much of the screen. The music score by Rob Simonsen is great and the makeup for the fat suit is stunning. This movie isn't for everyone as it is depressing and quite melodramatic. It also has some issues in the writing and story, especially considering one character who appears throughout but didn't add much to the plot in the end. Nevertheless, the movie is a hauntingly and heartbreakingly beautiful experience.",
  "SNUBBED by the Golden Globe Awards": "Brendan deserves every award possible for his role in The Whale and the Hollywood Foreign Press just added insult to injury.I am an advide film watcher and this movie had such an impact on me that I could not even leave the theater once the film ended. If you are not a compassionate or empathic person, I feel you may not understand the need to just sit and appreciate the story that was shared.This film is not just a story, it is an opportunity to see through a man's eyes that has lost everything he loved and then lost himself.Truly the best film and Brendan was BRILLIANT!Bring tissues!",
  "Best Aranofsky since Requiem for a dream, powerhouse by Fraser": "Well, that was something beautiful. My first thoughts leaving the cinema (holding my tears, like the rest). Hands down the best Darren Aranofsky movie since Requiem for a dream. The Wrestler was pretty good, Mother! Was ehh different.. But The Whale is almost as dramatic as Requiem for a dream but with a beautiful ending instead of a dark one.I am sure this movie will stick to me for some time, because it's been going through my head all night after seeing this.The whole movie takes place inside one house, which makes you feel like you are part of his small world almost only connected to strangers online.Props for Aranofsky for portraying this, really makes you feel for the main character.Fraser gives the performance of his lifetime.I would say that the best actors have a wide range from comedy to drama. Hard to imagine this is the same actor as from George from the jungle.He is the Bryan Cranston of cinema. I am now a fan.This is the best movie I've seen the last few months. Highly recommended. 9/10.",
  "An Ugly Thing with Flecks of Gold: My interpretation": "First off, I'll address the quality of the acting: as many have already said, the quality of acting in this film is phenomenal. I am of the camp that the quality of the acting greatly exceeds the story or material.The Whale is an ugly story, a diorama of self-destruction presented in claustrophobic and relentlessly uncomfortable form. In short, it is about a man who after suffering great personal loss has eaten himself to death. If you have seen TLC's My 600 lb Life, you are familiar with the source material. The Whale is largely a dark two-hour drama version of My 600 lb Life, except there is no hope of a happy ending.As someone who has a long history of dealing with health anxiety, as well as having personally known multiple morbidly-obese individuals who have died from their lifestyles, this movie was extremely personal and very uncomfortable for me. Many scenes are disturbingly and disgustingly voyeuristic in their showing of the main character's habits, labored breathing, and sweaty, failing body. In fact, the film opens with him masturbating and suffering a health emergency from the strain. The Whale is wholly unapologetic and unsympathetic in this regard, and many times feels akin to a slasher film in its fleshy, disgusting indulgence.The whale-ish accoutrements of the film are so on the nose that they are almost to be ignored. I adore Moby Dick, it is one of my favorite books, and was highly interested in how its themes might be woven into the movie. They are, but it is rather shallow in its presentation. The main character is a whale, ha ha. The essay written by the main character's daughter characterizing the whale description chapters of Moby Dick as simply distractions from the sad story are where the meat is. Clearly, the disgusting voyeuristic portions of The Whale are viewed as distracting by the director, and the real point of the story lies beneath. Indulgent and disgusting, but okay. There are also tacked on themes of authenticity, so surface level as to largely be ignored.What we see inside of this oily and multi-layered tale that takes place wholly inside a disgusting apartment is one of broad human tragedy. I ultimately decided that the real point of the story is one of community. The theme that comes up over and over is one of people relying on one single point of support, and failing from that.The enabling caretaker nurse who says that only she can save the main character, even as she has been killing him with her enabling of his habits.The main character himself, who was unable to save his boyfriend from suicide after estrangement from his family; telling his boyfriend that the boyfriend does not need God, he only needs their relationship.The missionary who tells the main character that he doesn't need anyone, only God.The mother who is drinking herself into ruin, who blames the dissolution of her family and rebellion of her daughter on the MCs faults.The only happy ending we have in the whole movie is informed, as the missionary boy who ran away after stealing money from his mission. After being ratted out by the MC's daughter, he is forgiven by his family and church, and welcomed with open arms back into his community. He has all of the elements wrapped together that the other characters only have in pieces: friendship, family, community, spirituality. I think ultimately this is the point of the movie, or at least the one I was able to glean after thinking it over for a few days. Every single main character in the film is a tragic one. Supporting cast members only show up either to gawk, or to be a warm source of community support.Nobody is an island, everyone needs a community of support and love, and substance abuse cannot fill the gaps left in this. To me, this is the story that was left unstated and implied. It is difficult to take the fragments of this gestalt from the dense and unpleasant presentation, but it is of course masterfully acted and presented.I do not like the indulgent nature of the film, and find it to be unnecessarily ugly. If the director actually did have good intentions with the direction of the film, then the ugliness that constitutes 80% of the screen time is as the film's essay says: a mere distraction.",
  "Aronofsky's best film since Requiem for a Dream": "Awards or not, The Whale is the best movie of the year, and it's Darren Aronofsky's best movie since Requiem for a Dream, and Brandon Frasier is thebmost actor deserving of an Oscars this year.I hope political correctnes doesn't rob Brandon, Aronofsky's and the movie from a deserved OSCARS.The movie hurts emotionally, as it shows true deep emotions of ewch of it's characters.Thats a strong point of the Whale, no character is left without exploration, it's not just Frasier's story and other actors only serve to supplement it... it's exploration of a story that all of them are part of , it jsut happens that he's in the center of it all.A truly amazing film.",
  "Disgusting and inspiring": "Put bluntly, Brendan Fraser has shown us that he can do more than just good-natured and crude characters that defined his stay in his early years in the cinema. Now, The Whale has allowed the actor to reinvent himself and build a human being full of complexes, feelings and regrets for the decisions he has made in his life and despite this, he seeks meaning at the end of everything.Even so, we cannot say that it is a hopeless film (as has happened in other Aronofski films by the way). The Whale is also a call for the protagonist of him and through facing his fears to find his own forgiveness in the attempt to, in his own words, do one thing right in his life.",
  "its hard....": "To restrain myself from giving this a 10 star award, therefore just a 9 because, and thats mostly due to that im not a good writer, and im not a professional reviewer and that i will never be due to old foregone aging, but what i saw here really lit up the respect for the acting talents of brendan fraser, that have had a roller coaster careere since ''george, king of the jungle'', a film that me and my kids almost succumbed to laughter way back then when i was able to take a laugh without having to wheeze afterwards...its an amazing story about the last week of a dying man, a small cast , well directed, extremely well ploted and ''make up'ted'' story, a drama that will bite someones guts im sure, and use all of my abilities to promote an oscar for mr fraser from the appearance he makes in this film.So a big recommend from the grumpy old man...",
  "Flawed but deeply thought-provoking": "There is something that doesn't quite hit the mark in THE WHALE, but it is still a worthwhile movie to watch. Charlie, a reclusive English teacher suffering from severe obesity, attempts to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter in a desperate bid for redemption. With his time running out and his health failing, Charlie must fight his way through his self-imposed isolation and the walls he's built up around him to find the courage to open up to his daughter and to find a way to make amends.Brendan Fraser, who plays Charlie, does an incredible job of conveying the complex emotions and struggles of being overweight. His performance is convincing and heartbreaking as he battles his physical limitations while attempting to build a bridge between himself and his daughter. Fraser's portrayal of Charlie is believable, allowing us to empathise with him despite his flaws.THE WHALE also features impressive performances from young actor Sadie Sink (Charlie's daughter, Ellie) and Hong Chau (Liz, Charlie's best and only friend). Sink does an excellent job of portraying the tension between Ellie and her father, as well as conveying the emotions of an adolescent trying to cope with an absent parent. Chau is also excellent in her role, providing much-needed comedic relief while still being able to convey genuine emotion and concern for Charlie.THE WHALE occurs almost entirely in Charlie's apartment. This setting allows the film to focus on the personal drama between Charlie and Ellie and provides a claustrophobic atmosphere that enhances the sense of desperation and isolation. Director Darren Aronofsky uses this limited space to significant effect, creating an intimate portrait of two people struggling with their issues while trying to bridge the gap between them.The cinematography in THE WHALE is also noteworthy. The camera often lingers on Fraser's face or body for extended periods, allowing us to fully appreciate the physical and emotional toll that Charlie's condition has taken on him.Unfortunately, THE WHALE suffers a few shortcomings that prevent it from being genuinely great. The pacing is sometimes slow, with some scenes dragging on longer than necessary. The film also lacks much plot development or character growth, leaving some characters feeling one-dimensional and underdeveloped. It also seems, at times, to have the feel of a stage production rather than a fully-fledged cinematic experience.Despite these issues, THE WHALE is an emotionally resonant film worth watching for its performances alone. It may not be perfect, but it is a thought-provoking and poignant film that will leave you with much to ponder.",
  "Weight to go Fraser!": "From The Mummy to The Whale, who would have thought BF could pull out a performance like this.Sadly, that's the only good thing about the movie. All the other actors are plain annoying and you feel no connection with them at all. The story seemed to drag, with a lot of pointless scenes (the pizza guy for one). Charlie preaches honesty and integrity yet hasn't seen his daughter, doesn't show his face to his students and wants to buy his daughter's love with the money he has stashed away. With all the takeaways he eats and the cost of living crisis, I wonder how he has saved that much money.Ellie is not perfect in any way at all, she is a bully at school and comes across like a spoilt brat at home. The common thread with her, is to refuse everything her dad asks but ten seconds later she changes her mind and listens to him.The ending is so melodramatic that it could quite easily belong in a Bollywood movie.This is not the best movie ever made like people are claiming, it doesn't even come close to The Shawshank Redemption, which is way more moving and uplifting and actually has a point.Overall I think it should really have been left as a play, it's a bit too ambitious for a movie but I wouldn't begrudge BF if he wins an Oscar from it.",
  "Brendan Fraser is brilliant...Darren Aronofsky starting to repeat himself": "Just to get this out of the way: Brendan Fraser is excellent in this film, should probably win an Oscar, and definitely reinvigorated his career.The film is simple in that it only has a handful of settings, and very few characters. Each character is flawed in their own way...sympathetic in their own way...and UNSYMPATHETIC in their own way.The only problem with this film is that it certainly appears that director Darren Aronofsky is starting to repeat himself with choice of material. Throughout the film, it is hard to not notice elements very similar to his earlier film The Wrestler (2008). It's certainly worth watching once, but as a rental. Can't really imagine anyone wanting, although it is powerful, to see this film more than once.",
  "If Only We Could Do One Good Thing With Our Life": "The weight of Death presses down on us, every day, making it harder to carry forward, but we struggle to breathe, to live. We have to hope, hope that despite the mistakes that we have made, we did something right. At least, one thing. Please, tell me that I did one thing right. I could make a very long list of the terrible things I have done, and those things have torn me apart, inside and out. I can't forget them for they are shadows inside my mind, scabs on my skin. You might not see my pain, but it's there, wearing my face. Still, I force a smile, but Death doesn't move an inch. It remains. My time is slipping. There's no more good that I can do now. No escape. I just live between memories, faded photographs. Please, tell me that I did something right. It would warm my heart like a sun over the ocean. If only I could bury my toes in sand and dream, dream of a better life than this, and somewhere in the distance, she reads to me, her last words. And maybe, maybe this sensation is no more pain but finally, peace.",
  "This is not another fat suit movie.": "My concern that the show would be another poorly handled \"fat guy\" trope was quickly allayed, as the main character is portrayed by Fraser with great sensitivity and palpable honesty.Great cast, all included, but especially Hong Chau. Everybody here is being emotionally torn apart, but no one more so than Chau's character. Her portrayal of Liz makes her the grasping, flailing, heart-rending everyman of this morality tale.A key plot device is an essay that is read aloud early on and over and over again. In its repetition, the author moves us through stages of grief as we gradually face up to his message.Bravely, strangely beautiful makeup artistry by prosthetic makeup designer Adrien Morot.Loved it.",
  "There's a blurred line between love and hate": "The song by the Pretenders comes to mind but the line is thicker and blurred .If we all could chose our life again what would we chose to change ?This is an incredibly powerful single set drama - all the action takes place in the lounge ( save fir a few scenes around his apartment) as we observe someone who has lost the will to live but knows that he cannot die without completing his final chapter .It's a story of love and a story of hate , a story of missing years and missed opportunities but underneath the hate and loathing is true care .This is based on a stage play and the claustrophobic set added to the drama . The title is not a reference to the morbid obesity of the main protagonist that would be too obvious it's more of a sympathetic observation of self harm in all its forms from drugs to alcohol to overeating . But the whale is very significant as it was the original title of Moby Dick when first published in london and the fact that Ishmael shared a bed with another man before setting sail on the whaling boat is more significant than you realise the better biblical metaphors continue throughout the plot with questions of morality and realisation that what's in the foreground is purely a camouflage for what's really happening in the background .The themes here are about loss , death , love of a father for his daughter , divorce , infidelity, parental infighting over paternal access , friendship , family , fulfilment , hate and most of all hurtActing was top notch praise goes to all three main characters. Hong chau was amazing , Sadie Sink outstanding and Brendan Fraser in the role of his acting career .Probably the most powerful ending I have ever witnessed to a filmOutstanding dramaPad. A 10/10.",
  "Just average.": "Overall, \"The Whale\" is a thought-provoking and emotionally charged film that explores themes of isolation, redemption, and the human connection to nature. It may not be to everyone's taste, but those who appreciate character-driven dramas and stories that tackle difficult subjects will likely find it a compelling watch.The film features powerful performances from its cast, particularly Fraser, who delivers a nuanced portrayal of a man struggling with his physical and emotional limitations. The cinematography is also impressive, capturing the stark beauty of the Alaskan wilderness where the story takes place.",
  "Fraser is stunning in a powerful and thoughtful film": "I'm becoming very good at spotting a film based on a play with no prior knowledge before viewing. 'The Whale' had it written all over it and sure enough I found out afterwards I was correct. To be fair, the single-setting was a bit of a giveaway. The thing I've found with movies based on plays - at least the good ones - is that they have exquisite dialogue. 'The Whale' was no exception.I have to give some love to Brendan Fraser. I always thought of him as the prototypical \"movie star\". A guy who could lead a movie and carry it with charm and charisma and good looks, but who would never be in contention come awards season. Boy, did he prove me wrong.He's incredible in this film. The transformation is one thing, but what really blew me away was the character he created. The emotions this man has to convey in this movie cover the full spectrum. And the toughest thing is that he often has to portray them at the same time. He has to have his soul crushed into a thousand pieces and in the same moment just be happy that his daughter is in his presence. It's heart-breaking to watch, but it's also mesmerising to see it portrayed so well.There are so many great moments in this film it can be hard to appreciate them all on the first watch. I suspect a second viewing would give an entirely new perspective again. On first watch though it was pretty amazing and definitely one of the best 2023 Oscar season has to offer. 9.5/10.",
  "Brandon Fraser did amazing job but movie a remake of the Wrestler": "I came to see bcuz his performance was mentioned that it was a oscar worthy performance and the movie was great.The story line was so a exact blue print of the wrestler 2008 with micky Rourke\nfilm was Okay but not well written...the performance brandon did was great! He nailed it, a simple story life of a obese gentleman dealing with depression and self load, that is trying to save his daughter from the self torture and agony of not having a dad. The narrative was okay with a poor ending, that should have been more realistic, instead it came off like a Disney finally, I would have loved the movie much more if the story line was stronger with inspirational ending, sadly it didn't. It made me think thrue the whole movie is why are they letting him eat so much, why isn't he trying to get healthier atleast a valid attempt. With that being said, I'm glad to see Brandon Frasier officially make a comeback with a phenomenal performance \ud83d\udc4f best acting in his career.",
  "Very good movie and better performance by Brendan Fraser": "I just want to say that, Brendan Fraser carried this movie all the way, such a sad a tough movie, but a very good movie when you put yourself in charlies mind and feeling angry and sad for him, so hard to watch.And Brenan Fraser did a perfect job transmitting that, it could not have been a better actor for this movie.With Aronofsky not showing his best directorial skills, maybe because of the writing and storytelling of the script. But does his job making it not an oscar movie, buy maybe for Brendan Fraser who saved this movie, maybe we will see him at least in the nominees, but hoping he wins it.",
  "Fraser is amazing": "I've been thinking for two days about what to say. It's worth mentioning in advance that I was waiting to see this movie for months and had very high expectations which I think is a disadvantage to any film.All in all I think I agree with most of the people who said something along the lines of \"Fraser is fantastic, the film is a bit lacklustre\". It is a GOOD film. Moving, interesting, engaging. Can't really find a real fault in it. It's just missing that little something that makes it exceptionally great.But what cannot be denied is that Brendan Fraser delivered the performance of the century. After just a few minutes I felt like crying. Nothing much has happened yet, he just... existed on the screen. And already he was magnificent. With all the masking, fat suit, cramped space, very few other characters to interact with he had such a limited toolkit at his disposal, and still, he did something breathtaking. He just morphed into this character and lived it in front of our eyes, uncovered, unafraid. It was awesome in the original meaning of the word.I really hope that this was not just a final shine, that he will finally get lots of roles worthy of his talent. I have to admit that I just love George of the Jungle with all its silliness, and quite liked The Mummy. But I was always more fond of Fraser's more obscure, \"smaller\" movies, like School Ties and especially With Honors, where he could show more of his talent and less of his abs. So here's to hoping to see him more and more often, in movies with challenging and complex characters.",
  "Great acting, pretentious film": "There is so much here to \"unpack\".Sorry, this movie is not a 10, it is not a \"masterpiece\". It is not about a morbidly obese guy trying to make a change in his life. If you are looking for those things, you will be disappointed.Brendan Frasier plays Charley, a morbidly obese college instructor who teaches college English classes online. He covers his camera so the kids don't see what he looks like. He is in extremely bad shape, but will not go to see expensive doctors. He has one friend, Liz, who takes care of him and likely keeps him alive. But she also feeds him terrible food as she feels sorry for him.His health is rapidly deteriorating, and the movie is like a countdown to his end. In the meantime, we discover he was always heavy, but went way over the top once his gay lover killed himself.A daughter he hasn't seen in years comes back into his life, via an awkward payment and homework \"help\" plan, as well as his ex-wife, and a missionary, and the sparks between all parties fly. There is plenty of good dialog and some truly moving moments. Great acting from all parties, particularly Frasier.What loses the movie for me is the script. Not only do the characters act in ways that make no sense, the REASONS behind their actions are preposterous.Second, the entire movie has a big, FAT thread of anti-Christianity running through it. To the point of absurdity. Everyone's parents seem to be obnoxious born-agains that absolutely ruin their kids' lives. The movie takes cheap shots at the Bible, including the dusty old premise of \"how could a God do this\" and, \"I can't believe a God would populate the world and then send almost everyone to Hell\". The only time Charlie gets angry in the whole film is when he is encouraged by the missionary to think about these concepts, and the idea of being saved.As the movie goes on, the worst person in this little ensemble is elevated by Charlie as \"amazing\", his daughter, who is a sociopath. Charlie's ex wife is the ONLY character that makes sense. She is, with good reason, bitter that Charlie left her for another man. She is the only one that thinks her daughter is evil, which, sorry to say, she freaking is. Lots of kids are a bitter because a parent walked out. But this kid is a freak. The mom mentions horrific things she has done in school. She posts awful pictures of her dad online, and has done the same to her mom. We are supposed to accept the outrageous idea that she \"helped\" the missionary by reintroducing him to pot, recording his heartfelt comments about his life, and then sending awful pictures and personal thoughts to his parents--somehow she was so brilliant in doing that knowing that the parents would forgive him and want him to come home. Charlie babbles on through his hacking about this, so it must be so.And let's talk about this missionary, Thomas. He's a white Christian, of course. The movie is \"brave\" for crapping on Christians, but not brave enough to make the character a black Baptist, or a soul-searching re-incarnationist, or heaven forbid, a Muslim. The only time Charlie gets truly passionate, beyond him going on and on how \"amazing\" his daughter is, is when he angrily assaults Thomas about gay sex to \"gross him out\" and expose his hypocrisy.Charlie himself makes no sense. He is an enormously smart, kind, sweet person who genuinely cares about others. He truly loves his daughter with his whole heart. (One might believe he refuses to see her sociopathy because of how much he misses her, but the movie never presents that possibility). But how could a guy like that leave his family, because of \"love\"? He is never portrayed as selfish or bad in any other way. The movie may have done something to show his true character--beyond his demeaning of Thomas--but we don't get that. But he sure does love that 8th grade essay of his daughter!The cheap Christian-bashing is only upstaged by the ending, when apparently Charlie reaches his end. Is his spirit pulled to heaven, even against his belief system? What's with all the lights, even on his daughter? And her sudden \"Daddy\" exclamation....Of course, this \"brave\" movie isn't brave enough to tell us that, it just ends.What I find so absolutely true is that if you have a movie with some good acting in it, a few good speeches, some scenes to make people come to tears, and some maudlin music, people will rate it a 10, without even thinking about it.",
  "Up there with Shawshank and Green Mile": "While this movie does not have the budget of the movies in my title. The acting is at or above the same level of those movies.Brendan Fraser steals the show with his emotions and drive in this film. I really forgot that I was seeing Fraser and saw Charlie a man whom has lost everything but is trying to retain just a little bit. Just a little...Sadie sink and Hong Chao also deliver masterful performances here. I actually disliked Sadie's character but that was the point.Hongs character is also gripping and telling revelation of her connection and dedication to Charlie is beautiful and loving. I do not want to spoil this movie for anyone beyond what I have said so far. Just please please watch this film and I promise you this film will at the least make you feel emotions that cinematography rarely does anymore. This film will make you feel the spectrum of emotions.",
  "Not a \"Feel good\" movie!": "I cannot explain what mood you should be in, to truly appreciate this film. But its definitely not the typical trash that hollywood has been churning out lately. Be ready with a pocketfull of tissues.What starts as a slow low budget drama, begins to get uncomfortable halfway in and continues to pick up emotional steam as it goes on. Last time I remember a movie with such impact while basically filming its entirety in one room was \"Glengary Glen Ross\". And that one was packed with stars. Frazier carries the load in this one.Intense. Well worth the ticket price. Brendan should see an award this year.",
  "Wow": "Went into this movie with only a hint of what the storyline might hold in store. It was such a riveting script that had us spellbound from the opening scene. It had the feeling of a Broadway Show that had been adapted for the screen. However, the performances made this one of the best motion pictures that we have seen in a long time. Brendan Fraser is brilliant as are all the other performances in this brilliant movie. This was a really wonderful way to start off the new year. Kudos! Darren Aronofsky has done it again by creating a masterpiece for the screen once again. We are hoping that this movie is nominated for many Academy Awards.",
  "Multi Themed Film": "Interesting how many reviews here deal with the literal storyline of the movie. I, at the risk of sounding pretentious, saw three themes: 1. The self destruction of America 2. The effect self destructive addiction has on loved ones and 3. The need for more authenticity in a digital world.Fraser's and Fraser's daughters character constantly talked about cutting through what \"was expected\" on the written page and instead to write truthfully and be more authentic as people.The fact that the leading character was destroying himself through his isolation, overeating and refusing to deal with his fundamental problems felt like a real metaphor for the state of the USA today.His refusal to deal with his addiction and the reasons for not dealing with it (he wanted his daughter to have a decent financial start in life) could relate to any destructive addiction. Whats more important? Financial security or saving your family the awful grief of seeing you, a loved one, slowly commit suicide?Anyway, a powerful film, well written with three outstanding performances from Fraser, Samantha Horton and Hong Chau.",
  "Gripping, intense, emotional. Incredible.": "Wow. I saw \"The Whale\" in theaters yesterday, and what a ride. It's rumored to be one of Brendan Fraser's best projects to date, and I can see why. The buzz surrounding this one has been great, and it's well deserved, IMO.The movie is absolutely worth watching. However, it's very intense throughout. Brendan Fraser's character (Charlie) struggles with compulsive eating. As a result, Charlie has gained a tremendous amount of weight over the last few years. When we meet him in his apartment, we quickly learn that he is housebound due to his size, and going downhill. More than that, he has battled obesity for years, and now faces certain death due to untreated congestive heart failure.That said, the movie is not actually about Charlie's weight. Numbers are never mentioned, though we do see adaptations Charlie is using: a walker, a handle above his bed, etc. It's really about 'the whale' his root problem has ballooned into: compulsive food addiction. Viewers can very obviously see he is a man of size, but Charlie is not concerned with his health. Instead, we see him use food as comfort. When it stops comforting him, he uses it to cause himself more physical and mental pain, going on extreme binges. He is a man full of self-loathing, and on some level, he knows his habits are \"disgusting\". Yet, Charlie is, sadly, past the point of return.Having pushed almost everyone in his life away as he put on more weight, Charlie is a lonely and reclusive character. Sadie Sink gives an incredible performance as his daughter, whom he attempts to connect with before his death. (Her breakout character on \"Stranger Things\" is not my favorite, but I do think she's given one of the most complex character arcs as Max.)Now. The plot of \"The Whale\" itself is beautiful. It is raw, and visceral all the way around. Charlie is a very good, intelligent person who has simply given up on himself. I found the movie to have a very somber tone overall, but Charlie is earnest. He intends to help others, and evoke true honesty from them in the process. The last bit of his life journey takes place over the course of a week, and his increasing desperation to just get on with dying, is plain. He wants so badly for his daughter to have a better life, and regrets the fact that he left her, after divorcing her mom. (I won't spoil the plot further.) Charlie hates himself for eating so much, truly HATES what he's become. And in fact, he's eaten himself to this state, so what's two large pizzas for dinner? A package of candy, tortilla chips, donuts...goddammit, why can't he just kill himself with food already???I try to be an open-minded and reasonable person, especially when it comes to movies. But \"The Whale\" is really a tough watch, in parts. It's 'just a movie', but it's really so painful to watch Charlie's binges get worse by the week's end...I had to close my eyes and/or look away at times. It's these moments of severe binging that are so intense...I actually found them grotesque and slightly disturbing, honestly. It's unfair, but that's the reason I'm rating as I am.However, \"The Whale\" is a stark depiction of addiction, and all the ugliness and struggle that accompany it (really any kind of it).Did I mention Charlie is an accomplished teacher? Melville's \"Moby Dick\" plays a meaningful role in this movie, which is very apropos.",
  "A movie that i'll never watch more than once but loved": "This movie tugs at the heartstrings so much and it is such a heartwarming story because of Brendan Fraser. If it were any other actor im not sure I would feel this way about the main character, but it's so depressing but so intriguing and it's made so well, I usually don't like A24 because they try too hard to be deep but when it comes down to it they fail on every level but this is a huge success from them and i'm willing to give them so many more chances after this one film. Thank you for giving him another chance in hollywood, he deserves it. I have no idea who I would recommend this to, because it's such a difficult but satisfying watch, just watch it if it intrigues you and you won't be disappointed, the acting is phenomenal, one of the best main character performances i've ever seen out for the thousands of movies i've watched.",
  "Doesn't work in real life if you are not Brendan Fraser.": "10/10 people will just find HIM disgusting. The sad thing is none of them will admit it. I will admit, but the whole world will be against me, even if HE wants to me say he's disgusting, because that's honesty. But yeah, people prefer living with the lies. With that as the main driven plot for the second part of the movie, it took him 9 long years to realize that. However, he likes the criticism and truth about him, yet he's afraid to show himself. The whole seems to be contradicting itself. Unless, it's just about being honest and not doing anything about it and just let the plot armor do it's work.",
  "Stunning": "I went to see this high hopes and by christ it didn't disappoint. Brendan Fraser is just incredible, rarely have I been moved by a character or movie in my life. From the opening scene I was enthralled by ever scene and sat on the edge of my seat for maybe 80% of the movie. If I wasn't at a cinema I would be loudly sobbing in my hands. You can absolutely see why Fraser got a size minute standing ovation, this is most definitely on track to clean up at the Oscars. My only gripe is Sadie Sink is not nominated, her acting is so believable it's scary. The prosthetics are so realistic I couldn't tell the difference at any stage. Just stunning from start to finish.",
  "Big Aronofsky, big Fraser": "A play taken to the big screen is not always easy to achieve, especially because of the very different formats that influence the entrances, exits, scenery, and character movements. That is where the director is great when in a single space he can generate so many emotions and not put pressure on the viewer. Fraser on the other hand contributes enormously to the director with an impeccable performance, very real and very heartfelt. Why then did I lower the rating? Because I saw flaws in the script and in the story and that idea of showing his addiction to food, more morbid than his own disease, which sometimes repels interest in the character.",
  "We're All Happy Brendans Back...But C'mon": "I'd been anticipating watching this movie for a while. After all the fanfare at movie festivals and award shows, coupled with the addition of Brendan Fraser being back in a leading role, it seemed almost impossible that this movie could be anything other than memorable masterpiece.And then I watched it.First and foremost - I can't take anything away from Fraser's performance. Not only is he believable in his role as a morbidly obese homosexual, but if anything the film needs more of him in and less focus on the auxiliary cast who are mediocre at best in both acting and intrigue.To be brief, the films problems are numerous- for one, its uninteresting. Not enough happens throughout the course of the movie and the characters feel like they are missing an arc. Secondly, I failed to root for any of them. The daughter is an irredeemable mess, and Charlie is both physically and mentally immovable from his current predicament. I didn't have enough reason to be invested or care about the outcome once the credits began to roll. The movie isn't that long, but it really felt like the last third dragged itself over the finish.To conclude, watch this movie if you really really like Brendan Fraser, but don't bother watching it if you actually want to see a good film.",
  "Depressing but if you watched My 600 Pound life on TLC, it's no different!": "I feel like if they marketed this movie as my 600 Pound life: but as a R Rated gritty film, this is the movie you would get. So why did they call it whale and make it biblical and poetic? Not sure, but it's still just as gritty...I thought Brendan Fraser was overhyped during the entire promotion run for The Whale...but honestly, he does need an oscar for this, he pulled it off just like the obese people on Reality tv show, My 600 Pound Life. The sad thing is, that show is REAL and this is fictional...Those people are actually bigger than Fraser here, and they can hardly walk...So if anything, the tv show my 600 pound life should be more depressing to watch, but we actually laugh at it...but we cry at this fictional film of a guy in a fat suit...This was still a great film. Without context or not.",
  "This movie proves you don't need much for an amazing movie": "This movie was basically filmed in just one room with 7 actors and a fat suit and ended up being one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. This proves you don't need high budget and special affects for a perfect movie. Brendan Frazier played such a great, realistic character which makes it difficult to watch but not in a bad way. It's difficult because it's a realistic situation that many Americans are in. The dynamic of the family and friends interacting with the main character also was very true to life. From start to finish this movie was perfect and as soon as this inspirational movie ended, I wanted to watch it again.",
  "I never cry... and I cried... a lot": "I went to see this movie with my bf, I'm not a really big fan of Brendan Fraser but I liked The Mummy and everyone were talking abt it so it convinced me.I sat on my chair and at the moment I heard Fraser talk through the screen with his students I felt something weird in my chest. Then it was history, I cried the whole movie and at some point I thought I'd had to go out from the cinema cs I was sobbing.The mix of feelings this movie makes you feel is indescriptible, I went from pity to anger to sadness and then happiness, just to end with this sensation of emptiness and impotence because the only thing I wanted was to cross that screen and hug Charlie.Usually I choose one character that \"stole the movie\" and of course in this case Brendan is the chosen one; but the women just left me speechless, the way they go through different phases with Charlie and the development of their relationship with him is so deep that I felt a connection with every one of them.I've seen a lot of movies in my life, believe me, A LOT; but this one went directly to my heart, I don't think I can watch it again but I won't forget it, never.",
  "God and Pizza": "The whale was ever so slightly underwhelming to me. Don't get me wrong this is an excellent film, very well written for the most part, acted superbly, and has characters who are not only believable but also likeable/loavable. However I went in with high expectations of this film, mainly hearing how it was going to win lots of awards but more than that the plotline really intrigued me. This is my issue more than The Whales issue because getting over excited about a film only leads to being let down and I just felt there was a little something missing from making this one of the best films I've seen.The first third of the film plays out exactly like I expected, we are introduced to our setting (Charlies home) where we spend the entire film, with only brief glances outside. I particularly like this because we as the audience get to see exactly what he saw. This is made evident when the camera pans past the darkened window as people leave and arrive at his apartment. We see the excellent Brendan Fraser taking on the role of a morbidly obese man and without doubt it's one of the best performances from any actor you'll ever see.The emotions he shows, the expressions he portrays even with this massive bodysuit surrounding him is profound and it's quite an adjustment to try to understand how someone like this lives, or should I say survives on a daily basis.Next we get introduced to his friend, a nurse who happens to be his deceased lovers sister. We see his aggressive and somewhat broken daughter, and more importantly a young man who claims to be offering help through religion. This is where the film begins to veer off track to what the main story is about and begin to explore what god means or doesn't mean to the characters. At first this boy seems to only want to help Charlie but as we see, and this is almost always true for every person, he has an ulterior motive behind helping. The film then starts to explore homosexuality and how that relates to god and heaven, with a particular scene near the end where charlie argues with the boy about thinking he wouldn't get into heaven if he was gay. This subject is something that is deeply divisive and everybody will have their own opinions on that matter but to roll out this storyline throughout did seem like The Whale was forgetting what the main plot point was. The daughter takes a back seat for awhile and Charlie's weight is nudged aside for a brief moment to look at this issue and for me this just wasn't as cohesive or as blended in to the overall story as I would have liked. It felt like the two stories were always contrasting with each other rather than working in harmony, a bit like two magnets trying to join but ending up in opposite directions. It does seem like the past 5 or so years almost every film tries to make a point or advocate on a certain topic, when almost always the best course of action is to simply tell the raw story, no side tales of oppression or dictation about how we should live our lives.Throughout the rest of film the reactions from people to seeing Charlie was a eye opening experience, and those of who he was close to were able to look past it, where as others like the pizza delivery man, or some of the students were shocked and somewhat disgusted by his appearance and condition.The Whale is a very grounded in reality film but the ending almost opposes that completely as we see Charlie basically get lifted into heaven. A somewhat strange but \"happy\" end to what was a rather stark and bare look at how someone of excessive weight lives.Overall a direct and poignant film that invokes certain emotions, if however not as strongly as I expected and a story that does sometimes get lost in the weeds when tackling subjects like God and homosexuality, however The Whale does come back around to finish on what the film was always meant to be about, A morbidly obese father trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter. If nothing else it's worth watching just to see a truly special performance by Brendan Fraser, who has dealt with his own share of obstacles and challenges but returns in truly great form.",
  "I expected better from Aronofsky": "The whaleOne of the things Charlie (Brendan Fraser) keeps brining up in this film is honesty and how writing that's honest is much more interesting to read, with that in mind I can't help but feel a little underwhelmed by the whale. This film has been picked up on the hype train by Brendan Frasers triumphant return and his brilliant performance however for me I was most excited to see a new Darren Aronofsky film. I enjoy how his films make us think about the world around us and the bleak reality of certain situations. My personal favourite film of his is without a doubt requiem for a dream, it's a film that although you want to watch again you can't always bring yourself to do it because of how bleak it leaves you feeling in the end. I didn't get that with this film, Brendan Fraser plays a morbidly obese man called Charlie who we watch as he pieces his past together as people come and go from his apartment. Fraser himself is the best thing about this film, he makes you really care about Charlie and has this infectious positivity about him. That being said the rest of the film wasn't nearly as engaging for me, I felt the themes of homosexuality vs religious weren't very unique or conveyed in a unique way and I felt the drama at times bordered on the melodramatic. I think this is one more for the actors amongst us than the directors/ironically writers.",
  "Too Majestic to Fit the Screens": "This review is for those who are serious in learning the symbols, meaning and cinematic beauties of this workThere are a lot of things that needs to be mentioned and I don't know where to begin!1. Aronofsky very cleverly decided to take the movie in 4:3, it is a very important indication. It is trying to capture Brendan Fraser in his giant appearance in the smallest medium (aspect ratio) possible, it is trying to send a message to us: This man is far too big (read majestic) to fit into the limits of cinema (read the world)!2. The color palette of the movie is of course the muted tones and shades of blue/gray to convey a sense of dullness and sadness to the abysmal situation the main character is in.3. The movie smartly avoids getting tangles up in flashbacks and the background story, it was a wise decision since the background story leading to the present situation isn't in particular genuine and it is somewhat trite and repetitive even. I won't say what it was to keep this spoiler-free.4. The rooms at the back of the house, connected by a narrow corridor to the living room are the \"lair of the whale\", somewhere tiny and disgusting, they represent the most intimate parts of Charlie's life, where he shamefully goes to bed and washes himself, where he gets completely isolated from the rest of the world, disconnected. At the beginning when the daughter enters the play (I say play because it is more like watching a play than a movie, the same feeling I had when watching the amazing masterpiece (Father)), she is intimated to go wander around the house, as if a magical curtain forbids her to get close to the father who has abandoned her. However as the plot develops, the girl ventures into the lair, and a certain room gets unlocked by another character which I will now discuss.5. The locked room, that Charlie keeps the key to somewhere out of reach (for himself) is of course the symbol of all the bad cherished memories, a room that he hold so dear, remnant of the love he once had (again not going into details); in this period another character enters the play, a young preacher boy who want to convert Charlie and as he says to save his soul and give him redemption. In one scene he helps him to unlock the door after he has had a futile attempt to retrieve the key and then we realize what the room is. It is a sacred space, everything is intact, pristine, and in stark contrast to the mess of the rest of the house. In a great scene Charlie even smells the room, the room that once belonged to his lover, also smells great.In another scene he tries to enter the room, but he doesn't fit-both literary and figuratively- another important point that the director is telling us, he is telling us that he has let go of himself so much that doesn't belong neither to his memories and to the normal man he was before getting obese nor does he belong to the world he is living in now!6. After the daughter enters the story also a bird enters the story who seeks shelter behind his window for food, he puts food to lure the bird to come back the same method he uses to convince his daughter who he had abandoned to spend time with him (though with another motive), this bird at the same time is a mirroring of the daughter and a symbol of freedom and hope, it's light body a contrast to his heavy body and it's ability to fly and roam freely a forgotten wish for Charlie.7. Now I discuss the connection of the movie with the book \"Moby-Dick\". One may think that Charlie is the white whale, but he is captain Ahab, trying to right the wrongs in his life trying to mend the fractures, and at the same time he IS the white whale as he is trying to kill himself by obesity! By reaching his white whale he is trying to do \"just one right thing\" is he heartbreakingly says at the final scenes.8. This movie is based on a play so it is normal that we don't see a scene change and it also has a deep meaning that Charlie is confined to the confines of both his body and his house.9. The director never shows us the Charlie from before, even in the flashbacks we only see his feet, even when some old photos of he and his lover are found the camera doesn't let us see the man he was before, it is very smart, it is consolidating the fact I mentioned earlier, he has reached a no-turning point, he is only a memory a remnant of what once was and is no more. Of course we are not allowed to see him except for the form he has assumed (the giant whale).10. The musical score is fantastic, it is magnificent and it elicit the deepest emotion in the audience.11. The final thing I want to analyze is the last scene, when he is dying and the daughter comes back, and we find out that the essay was hers all along and she gets emotional. In this scene we again hear the waves, the sea. The same thing we saw for a very brief moment of flashback few scenes before, a perfect memory for Charlie forever preserved with his first family when his daughter was playing in the sands near the sea and he could feel the sea on his feet. Now as he is passing away, the daughter, distressed and emotional, suddenly opens the door and after days of rain, the sun (in its most beautiful form) shines on Charlie's face, as if he has found the salvation he was looking for, and we again start to hear the waves and the sea that is calling him, to take him to his perfect memory. Then he stands up with no help, giant and illuminated by light, majestic and he puts a step forward the bloated ugly foot and the scene cuts immediately showing his normal feet from before, going into the water (what beautiful transition) he stands big and majestic like The Whale in front of his daughter and then he is free from his shackles, the music soars and the movie end.Finally, another beautiful thing is that Charlie has become the Whale (read obese) by consuming not just food, but all the guilt, all the shortcomings and all the heartbreaks the life has imposed upon him, it has crippled him and still he has a very complex and interesting character, and more importantly at the end HE is the one who ties all the loose ends and becomes the symbol of redemption.There are so many more things I want to add but I have already written a lot so enjoy.",
  "Better than I expected, but it has a few issues": "I had reservations about seeing this movie. I worried this would be a prestige version of My 600-Lb Life. Instead, I found a compelling, character-driven story. Brendan Fraser deserves all the praise he's been getting for this role. He poignantly shows the pain of a broken man who's aware of his fate and wants to use the little time he knows is left to reconnect with his estranged daughter (played by Sadie Sink).Hong Chau also does a magnificent job as Liz, his friend, nurse, caregiver-and enabler. She portrays the challenges of taking care of someone who refuses to take care of themselves. As someone who had to take care of a disabled mom, I relate to this character.The movie has several issues. It looks more like a filmed play instead of a movie. Even the set looks like it belongs on a stage. Also, the connections between characters are too neat, especially with the \"New Life Church.\" A few twists seem contrived.The movie is worth seeing for Brendan Fraser's performance. He compels us to look beyond his outward appearance to see the humanity within.",
  "This movie made me happy to be alive": "The movie is a masterpiece! I didn't even know I have these emotions within me. And I haven't felt such raw emotions in a long time. I'm glad I'm alive this time on earth to experience this.It's a pretty plain setting. Everything happens in the house but there's zero boring second. It gets me hooked throughout. I was quite confused about how random some characters are, like the mission and pizza guy. And I didn't fully understand why Ellie was so mean and did what she did. I still didn't get a lot of it. But at the end, it all kinda makes sense, brought out the plot line and brings the message of how people care.All the characters are so complex and that's what so great about the movie. I was so moved by Liz and his ex wife's selflessness, and how they managed to still care for Charlie despite his sometimes selfish act. It's so sad to watch Charlie's condition but I like how he sees the good in everyone. Instinctively, i didn't like the missionary and Ellie. They don't seem to care about Charlie for the right reason but it's understandable and I can see some good in them.",
  "Brandon was amazing but...": "Brandon Fraser gave his career best performance in this movie. However, the overall film is very generic. None of the characters are likable, and pose as one-note characters with little to no character arc. Sadie Sink's character is just an edgy annoying teenager throughout the whole movie. Secondly, they TELL us too much of the story of how Charlie became obese instead of SHOWING the process of how he ended up obese.Cinematography: The entire movie is basically shot in one room, but this in my opinion was a bad directing choice. They should've shown more character arc, and shown more backstory to make the characters more real and grounded, instead of one-note characters. To be honest, the scene at the end where the whole family comes together is probably the best scene in the entire movie.A positive thing that I would like to say aside from Brandon's performance is that they tackled obesity in a very realistic way, although they could've went deeper. This may be the first movie to remotely tackle obesity in a serious manner that wasn't way too over the top or disrespectful towards people suffering from obesity.",
  "Weak Aronofsky": "I found it absolutely dumbfounded, unimaginative, repetitive, boring. Lots of plot left out for no reason and lots of nonsensical scenes in it for no purpose but to press the right buttons to manipulate the audience into believing this was an acceptable grief study. Fraser is a charming man always but not here. For a movie who praise so much at the core of the story to be honest (also used repetitive as an add filter for their Trojan horse story) only at the end have a moment of honesty. I couldn't believe Fraser nor the motives for Charlie. He was good but not that good. Doesn't deserve an Oscar for this, in my opinion. Sandler did a few years ago. Sadly not Fraser. (I wish I was wrong)",
  "Incredible": "Brendan Fraser has been one of my favourite actors for as long as I can remember, I was so elated to hear that he was returning and that he was set to be the lead in such a strong film. This film took me through many emotions, it made me feel for every character, and brought me both anger and sadness as well as love.Charlie is such a strong person, the way he never showed hate to anyone and remained positive even when you could clearly see he was struggling. The love he had for his daughter, friend, partner and ex. The love he had for random people, whether it be because he wanted them to expand their talents, or to show them a different view of life and beliefs.This is by far one of the greatest films I have seen, and there aren't many. I mean there are great movies through comedy, romance etc. But nothing like this. This film depicts the love and loss of a partner, the troubles of a broken family, the challenges of living as an obese person, a queer person, a person who's beliefs don't make room for who they are as a person. It follows the story of not just Charlie, but also; Ellie and her struggles, Liz and her ability to continue to love someone who would remind her of her brother and both their ED struggles. A woman who is trying to understand where she went wrong with raising a daughter, and a boy who's beliefs, troubles and incidents led him to meet such an incredible person who (hopefully) taught him that not everyone can be helped by god.This movie is deep, and is not for everyone but I highly recommend watching it. There is so much courage and pride that Charlie possesses, and so much that can be learnt from his character.",
  "An honest and in-depth look at a global problem.": "\"The Whale\" is a deep and devastating film, whose script involves the reasons that led a man to morbid obesity, elements such as religion in his loving relationship and abandoning a daughter play an important role in the plot. Brendan Fraser offers a totally realistic and human performance, while Hong Chau gives a performance that connects with the viewer, giving life to a funny, sincere character with internal pain that the actress shows spectacularly in each scene. Darren Aronofsky's work as director is perfect in each scene, providing that personal stamp and artistic freedom that A24 gives him. The art direction in the only location of the film is successful, full of props that tell us about the life of the protagonist: food, a bible, his work objects, tools to cope with his obesity problem, etc. The soundtrack is non-existent in a large part of the footage, but suddenly it appears in a peak scene, filling with emotions along with the image that is shown on the screen. \"The Whale\" is a masterful masterpiece, a powerful drama that immerses us in the life of a person with obesity problems from a realistic and objective perspective.",
  "Gut-wrenching and emotional. Brendan Fraser makes a masterful comeback": "I decided to see this movie because of Brendan Fraser and he delivers what is arguably the best performance of his career and an epic comeback since his being ostracized by Hollywood.Fraser plays a morbidly obese man unable to leave his own apartment which is the only setting used in the film. It's amazing what a film like The Whale accomplishes with the use of one location and a well-crafted set design allowing the audience to piece together the history of Brendan's character and tragic backstory. While The Whale's cinematography does not deliver the same level of heightened realism as Aronofsky's other movies such as Black Swan, it still does such a great job of capturing the physical and mental decline of Brendan's character. Brendan's acting alone is enough reason to see this masterpiece of a film.",
  "A good look at the human condition, but I wasn't blown away.": "So, I didn't leave the theater blown away like I expected to, based on the reviews that I have read for this film. But I will say that I did cry a few times during it. It is a look at the human condition. If you can identify with abandonment (as a child or abandoning yourself as an adult by letting completely loose on yourself and your dignity), eating disorders, obesity, a tough relationship between father and daughter, etc., then your heart will most likely be touched at some point during this film. I thought the acting was great, especially by Fraser and Sink (the daughter, as much as we love to hate her). I'm excited to see Brendan returning to film after all he has been through, and I hope to see more of him soon.",
  "Masterful performance, carrying an average script": "It is always good when Darren Aronofsky releases a new film, as it's usually an original bold movie, with a unique style.The best about this film is obviously Brendan Fraser's acting, which is masterful.Yet it's a masterful performance, carrying an extremely average script and terrible supporting actors who constantly try to sink the film, which besides treating obesity with fetish, is superficial in the loss of faith of the protagonist, as well as in the obsession of the essayists and exaggeration in the analysis of literary works (or art in a general), in a parable with Moby Dick that makes complete sense, however thrills much less, than Brendan Fraser's deep looks.",
  "Heartbreaking Honesty": "First Impressions:It was amazing to see Brendan Fraser back on the screen. While his performance in \"The Whale\" was certainly one to watch, the plotline deserved equal praise for its honest approach to storytelling and the elegant way it bottled a deep and human message.Story Analysis:Regardless of your personal preferences, Brendan Fraser's performance will be relatable on so many levels. It was for me. The full power of his acting capability was showcased in \"The Whale\" and it was magnificent to watch.The supporting artists balanced the entire production and helped convey the message at the core of the plot, that everyone's fighting their own demons and we should all just be a little kinder to one another.\"The Whale\" featured a closeted homosexual man named Charlie suffering from obesity and self-acceptance. He had a daughter (Ellie) with a woman (Mary) from whom he was long-divorced.Charlie worked as a college essay writing teacher. Albeit his courses were taken online, he communicated deep empathy and sharp observations to his students.Now, I don't believe they made the lead character gay just to get audience approval, let alone their pity. It was relevant to the plot in so many ways and connected exceptionally well with real-life situations that affect the same-sex community.Aside from living with a congestive heart condition, Charlie was also depressed, owing in large part to his boyfriend and life-partner Alan's suicide. A while after that, Charlie started to put on weight and didn't quite stop.Adapted from Samuel D. Hunter's stage play, and written by the man himself for the screen, \"The Whale\" has to be seen by as many people as possible. It was a story about acceptance, most especially the lack of it.Musical scoring was extraordinary. Hair-makeup and costume design were excellent, particularly for Charlie. Art direction and set decoration were noteworthy. Editing and VFX were superb. Cinematography was ingenious. Screenplay was brilliant. Direction was outstanding.Final Notes:Charlie's interactions with his daughter Ellie, nurse Liz, and ex-wife Mary were gripping and meaningful. Brendan Fraser's performance was heartbreaking and brilliant. The dialogues were carefully written for all characters in the movie. Not a line felt like it didn't belong.As the story progressed, the importance of unconditional love, honesty, and truthful expression became some of the most significant messages to be found in \"The Whale\".",
  "Pretty good movie": "Some people seem to be upset about this being a sad movie which is certainly an acceptable response. However confusing a sad movie with a bad movie is just wrong, especially with the other movies Darren have made, none of which have a happy ending if I recall.Anyways, this movie tells a pretty good story that has a very real feeling, nothing is too exaggerated and the pacing is just right if you ask me. Nothing too spectacular in the camera work and there's nothing too special about the other characters either. Sadie Sink's acting is alright but it's really Brendan Fraser that has the standout performance and I'd be surprised to see anyone take the oscar from him.",
  "Powerful Beyond Words": "The Whale is another successful notch in Aronofsky's belt and goes further to proving that he's one of the greatest art directors of our generation. Brendan Fraser pulls in a triumphant return to big screen acting in one of the most emotionally demanding roles I've seen in a long time. He really was the perfect choice for this kind of character; loveable, forever positive, vulnerable, and capable. And also Hong Chau who seems to be the only cast member that can keep pace with the sheer depth Fraser can bring. Not a lot actually happens in The Whale, and yet the themes it touches upon and the characters it explores culminate in an overwhelming experience that's hard to describe. This isn't my favourite Aronofsky movie, far from it, but it's definitely his most emotionally complex. I need to see it again to properly process my feelings, but at the same time I'm scared of living that experience again. Just like mother!, I find myself in deep praise of The Whale, yet at the same time resistant to ever going back to it. I give it a high 8/10, tickling the underbelly of true greatness, really only let down by its miniscule scope, resulting in it feeling like just a filming of the play it's based on, rather than a movie in its own right. But the emotions are still raw and I'm still in a state of processing.QyrosMovies.",
  "A good film.": "This movie is neither as good as some suggest or as bad as some others may suggest. It's a good movie. Nothing ground breaking in my opinion. It has some good to great performances at times. I'm not sure Fraser deserves the Oscar nod though.There is something about this film that makes me feel a little uneasy at times. There's just something i can't put my finger on. It's not the subject matter or anything. It just comes across as not genuine at times.It's also a bit old for this director to shove religion into all his films. Ok, we get it, ya read the bible a a lot. Let's move on.The makeup and the suit are ok. I still feel like I'm watching someone in a costume though, which is weird and can take you out of the film at times.I would say give it watch but don't go in overhyping it in your mind or you may end up a little disappointed.",
  "Repugnant and Overhyped": "Darren Aronofsky's ability to over complicate and over hype is honestly astounding.This film does everything it possibly can to tell you exactly how to feel in every scene. Lacking any nuance or respite to allow you to sit and soak in the scenes. Most of which containing endless shouting between characters.Their complex relationships are shallowly explored at the bare minimum level and every character seemly flips on a dime just from a single line of dialogue.Brendan Frasers performance is fine but is far from the best this year.The script is meidiocre, strange shoe horning in of a religious subplot and from what I can figure is attempting some sort of jesus metaphor for Fraser's character.A total waste of two hours that desperately attempts to create depth without having any.",
  "Great performances and a strong text.": "\"The Whale\" new film by brilliant director Darren Aronofskyi goes deep into his own cinematic ideas, despite being a story adapted from a play the \"Aronofskyikian\" elements are there, the psychopathic immersion in something, the analogies and metaphors, the religious criticism and obsession, the latter present in all of his works. And it's easy to understand why the director chose this play to adapt. The first element that catches the eye is Brendan Fraser's performance, he is brilliant, at the same time that he is a suffering and charismatic performance we feel an anger at the character for his lack of combativeness due to guilt, his intonation and body performance are also incredible , another highlight of the performance is that of her friend and carer Liz, played by Hong Chau, who is great in an interpretation of a tough and friendly character, on the other hand, one of the pillars of the story, the young Ellie played by Sadie Sink makes a poorer and weaker performance. The script is very good, all well put together, full of morality and allegories, with dialogues and an almost personal text talking about writing with passion and not with technique, these passages are beautiful and touching, I really like this personality in the text of \"A Baleia \". The photography is dark and sad, as is the composition of the dirty, sunless scenery, it is always a depressing and hostile atmosphere, the make-up is a separate element and should arrive strong for the Oscars. Darren Aronofskyi brings harrowing scenes, it seems that we are always breathless watching his film and the protagonist's life being held by a thread. One point that takes me away from the film is the same thing that takes me away from Aronofskyi's previous film, the feature \"mother\", from 2016, both go too deep in their religious and poetic metaphors in addition to having a slow montage, I didn't like it either the use of the camera and the soundtrack although the sound mix is great. 8/10.",
  "Much more than physical appearance.": "The movie \"The Whale\" is not just a discussion about the main character's physical appearance but much more than that. It's about his moral and emotional condition as a result of his physical condition. Brendan Fraser throws himself physically and mentally into Charlie's journey to self-destruction. His character is not negative, on the contrary, he is positive about life: when he feeds the birds, when he teaches his students to be sincere and honest with their lives, and when he sees his daughter's evil actions as good intentions. Charlie is just tired of suffering from the loss of his partner and the absence of his daughter in his life. He just doesn't see a purpose in life.\"The Whale\" is based on the play of the same name and mixes themes related to religion, family, relationships, loss, the meaning of life, and true self-identity.Darren Aronofsky makes an excellent direction but chooses to have some scenes or dialogues as if they were a theater play and not a movie, and it breaks the rhythm of the story, i.e. All scenes where the characters stop and stare in front of the door.The film has an impressive emotional charge and Brendan Fraser is the main culprit for bringing all these pains to the surface. Superb performance!!!",
  "Hard to Watch, but Even Harder to Look Away.": "I saw this movie for two reasons.1. I love Darren Aronofsky's films.2. I wanted to see Brendan Fraser in his comeback role after how passionate he's been about this film.My heart was aching by the time I left the theater and genuinely still is. I left the theater feeling humbled and hurt, but also optimistic and grateful for my life.Charlie is the protagonist of the film but you get a glimpse into his loved ones and acquaintances perspectives towards him, and they all view him as the antagonist. Yet you leave somehow empathetic towards every person involved. You really do feel for Charlie but you don't blame a single person for their harsh feelings against him. You're angry at him for leaving, you're proud that he was true to himself, you're happy that he found love, you're hurt to see him self destruct and you're disappointed by his choices. It's thought provoking and genuinely one of the best films I've seen in years!Brendan Fraser, you deserve an Oscar. You were transformative and the movie would not have left such a mark without you.",
  "On a wheelchair, obese Brendan gives a superlative award winning performance": "WHAT'S GOOD. Definitely an outstanding performance by Brendan Fraser playing Charlie an acutely obese man restricted to a wheelchair. Done up with prosthetics, looking grotesque and projecting bitterness, agony superbly, Brendan slays it with some mind boggling acting. If this doesn't get him the Oscar, I don't know what will. He is a prisoner in his apartment, unable to get up, bitter about life but he is soft natured also as he keeps apologizing. He has some kind of a death wish and eats like a glutton. He had abandoned his wife and daughter ( 8 years old ) to continue his gay relationship. Now much older, filled with remorse and guilt he wants to build fences with teenaged estranged daughter. He is looked after by a medical attendant Liz who offes him help, food, solace and succour. As Liz, Hong Chau gives an amazing performance which is endearing. She also deserves the supporting actress award. The climax is done extremely well and will sadden many. ( That could be the reason for the 6 minutes standing ovation Brendan received at a film festival some time back )\nWHAT'S NOT SO GOOD. Director Darren Aronofsky has adapted it from a stage play and it shows from the way the movie presented. The camera remains in the apartment and actors strut about shouting in anger. This sub narrative isn't focussed and the subplots are a distraction. The characters of daughter Ellie ( Sadie Sink) and wife Mary ( Samantha Morton) are ill defined and lack conviction. Both have also overacted in their roles needlessly and some restraint in their interpretation was necessary. To make things worse, another character of a Christian missionary who keeps popping in and out doesn't appear convincing despite quite a bit of screen time. His scenes with Ellie look redundant and don't add to the main plot.CONCLUSION. A must watch for the acting of Brendan Fraser and Hong Chau. Though the movie deserves a 6 due to the not so good points, I am going for with 8 due to the overwhelming first rate acting of Brendan Fraser.",
  "Honest and confronting": "I went into this film expecting the worst having seen Women Talking the week before and being bored out of my brain, but The Whale surprised me with its unflinching honesty and confronting visuals. I was surprised by how much this film affected me and how it kept in my head for days afterwards. This is really solid film making. The acting is fantastic all round, particularly Fraser, whose performance raises the entire film a couple of notches.The Whale misses out on a higher score due to it being (like just about every film this year) 10-15 minutes too long, and also because I found some of the blocking of scenes too stagey, where characters would go to leave then pause at the door, back to camera, before finally (and dramatically) turning and reentering the scene - people just don't do that in real life and it drives me nuts, very surprising from Aronofsky.",
  "Not just a movie about a fat slob": "For months and months they hyped this movie up ad nauseum, mostly with endless praise for Brendan Fraser. Then it came out to unsurprisingly disappointed audiences. Many of my most trusted friends told me the movie sucked, that it was just a stage play on screen, that Brandan Fraser did nothing and the fat suit did all the acting. I'm glad they told me that, because it brought my expectations to a reasonable place.The Whale DOES feel like a stage play brought to screen, as it takes place entirely in one setting. I don't know why that is such a bad thing for some people, I would have found it incredibly hokey if the 600lb man went on some sort of journey. I was underwhelmed by the fat suit to be honest. It looked fantastic, but not as gross as everyone was saying. I was expecting some grotesque body horror, he was just fat.But the story isn't just about a fat guy and his problems. It's about WHY he's fat. It's about self destruction, about how one person's fall from grace causes others to fall, and ultimately it's about trying to end that cycle. It's also about the importance of having someone who cares enough to be honest. I really thought it was a beautiful movie and a lot of people completely missed the point because they couldn't get over a guy in a fat suit.I will say that Fraser's acting was a little overhyped. He was great, but I'm not sure it was my favorite performance of the year. I think some of the problem was his character had a tendency to be disingenuous, so his acting came off that way. I wasn't overly impressed by anyone in this movie, Hong Chau probably gave the most genuine performance.Definitely worth watching, it's good to have Aronofsky back. I thought we'd lost him.",
  "If only the writing was stronger": "The actors are truly solid in this film but they are not believable because the writing is so bad! It's truly a wonder the actors did such a good job.There is someone for everyone in this film. A character to relate to which keeps the film going. Normally it would be difficult to watch a film that takes place in one room but the viewer is invested from the start. What will happen? I'm not going to tell you but as ridiculous as the ending is, I rather appreciated it. I never though Brendan F was a great actor but he has guts playing this part. I imagine the fat suit of 300 pounds helped him get into the role...",
  "Self reflection and honesty is hard": "This movie is about honesty and reflection of own self or actually refusal of that reflection.This movie finds us searching for the honesty we all want, but often can't either get or can't bear to hear even if deep down we want to.The obese Charlie is dealing with trauma by distancing from it, at the same time he is refusing to self reflect on his own health and habits. He is demanding honesty from everybody around him, but fails to be honest about himself. Charlie is willing to dig down the honesty and truth of others by taking the social tolls on himself. This is partly, because he is dying and is more interested finding redemption for his life through his daughter.His daughter Ellie on the other hand is dealing with her trauma by trying to avoid it completely. She is being mean and hurtful so she wouldn't attach to anybody so she couldn't be left again. She is probably also trying to make others feel as bad as she is feeling.Her dad however doesn't believe in it, he feels she is good and decent. Partly, because he needs her to be good for his redemption, but also for allegorical reasons (Jesus). She however doesn't want to hear anything positive about herself from his dad, who she hates. All this is also signaled when she tried to do bad, but it still had positive outcome. She is deep down not like the surface is.Okay that is what this movie is about in core. Let see something else \"boring\" stuff here. Acting is amazing, the look of the makeup/costume/hairstyle, production design and the cinematography just the cherry on top of it. Everything blends so well into the narrative and it is just not that it \"looks the part\". It feels the part. The camera finds all the right angles for the maximum effect either \"physically\" or emotionally. The camera can find amazing composition for the dialogue and drama going on.Dialogue is mostly where this movie shows cracks. It is in few scenes at times pretentious, repetitive (not referring to the essay) and overtly edgy with what is either commenting at \"today's liberalism\" or weirdly being it. I am not sure what was the point of some of it. Well I understand the effect it wants it is about the the trauma again, but the actual content of it. (the character is in that scene edgy, because she wants people to not like her and also she wants others to be miserable as she is).Also at few times I think the dialogue is just plain impossible to be delivered in a tone that fits the movie so it artificially might seem \"bad\" acting, but really stems from the content not being fitting for the tone of the movie. These mostly are minor scenes so not really big things.So yes very powerful movie in acting, in technical aspects and I would say in theme. Why it isn't 10 really comes down to the fact that it isn't really ground breaking in its themes and message. I also find it bit too convoluted in its attempt to insert these \"snippets\" of commentary on certain things. They are just snippets, they don't really communicate anything meaningful. It is like listing topics, but visually.Briefly about the \"fat-shaming\". I mean anybody who thinks being this overweight is normal just don't watch this movie. He is literally killing himself by eating. All the parts where the eating is consider by many critics \"gross\" is actually your own projection about those parts being \"gross\". They are emphasizing the act, because he is already dying, but keeps eating and usually after trauma surfacing or him not accepting his own reflection. He is suppressing the feelings. You could find parallel in other movies where the director is giving close up on razor blade and veins and the blood in suicide scene. It is giving detailed frame on the act that is taking the life away. It forces viewer to look there rather than it happening behind some closed doors.",
  "The Whale, an emotional experience": "The Whale is an emotional experience, a heartfelt drama about one man's love and pain, human frailties that spill over into interpersonal relationships, relationship with God, with the past and with oneself. Director Aronofsky, Brendan Fraser, Sadie Sink and Hong Chau - the faces chosen to represent those who worked on the making of this film - have created a cinematic journey that thrives on emotions and words, piercing looks, and deep, true and sincere existential reflections. A moving soundtrack accompanies the film, which takes place entirely in the protagonist's home and through heartbreaking dialogues enraptures the viewer. A film that has no need for action or scenery, but makes emotions and human frailties its main protagonist.",
  "Almost as corny as The Fountain": "My God. The Fountain. I thought Darren Aronofsky would never go there again. Boy was I wrong. So here it is, The Whale. Cannot believe some of the dialogues and situations. And the ending. My God. The ending. I mean, really? It was like a bad film student project. I just could not stop laughing. But by the reviews here people actually bought it. It will definitely win at least an Oscar or two of course, but in reality it really deserved a bunch of Razzies. This is my first review in IMDB even though I've been using it daily for decades. That was how much I was appalled by the reviews here. It's one of the corniest movies I've ever watched in my entire life. But I guess that's what people like. Hey, isn't Titanic hitting the movie theaters again?",
  "Some things should not look good, feel good, or please us.": "The authenticity and vulnerability of the film was scarring and yet invigorating.From the get-go I approached this film with a sense of compassion and empathy for an actor that was shunned, coerced to obscurity and almost anonymity for unclear and controversial circumstances. The part was a role that could also tap his current situation and utilize it to connect with the audience: a man that was agonizing for validation and redemption in a collision course of self-destructiveness.The scenes in the film pulled no punches: raw unpleasant emotion, exploiting unaesthetic shock, deep meaningful emotions in a last decade of predominantly super hero films. The movie is in some portions of the film a deep dive into the ruthless bias that humans have for both aesthetically and psychologically unpleasant events: the abandonment, emotional abuse for Charlie's obesity, unabashed manifestations of disgust targeted towards him. We follow him in his self-destructive journey and hopefully understand and come to terms with his ultimate decision, without judgment and empathetic acceptance.Brendan's performance accomplishes evoking care, concern, sadness, disgust; a multitude of emotions that are surprisingly intense for a film that takes place in its entirety in the confinements of his apartment, gives credence to the complexity of the performance. Sadie Sink performance was impactful, hateful but, frequently, in little micro-actions, giving that sign of hope that redemption was attainable. The film was able to accomplish its goal and didn't stray too much with some subpar cameos or loosely tied appearances.Invigorating to see that the realness of the movie was not betrayed with a feel-good ending. The ending was sober and serious, a movie that exposes and educates on the complexity and tragedy of abandonment, trauma, dogmatism, identity issues, and our mortality. Truly, some things should not look good, feel good, or please us or it renders the viewer incapable of truly understanding the plight of the Charlie.",
  "Listen to Ke Huy Quan: Bring a box of tissues when you see this movie.": "I hate to start this review in a self-referential way, but those who have spoken with me know that I'm a person who hardly gets emotional about drama movies or series. And don't get me wrong, I like works that use this resource well in favor of a good story. Simply, most of the time, these emotions simply don't cause real reactions, due to many factors, almost all related to the way in which they are carried out. With The Whale, you can start forgetting about everything I just wrote. This is a film that builds itself, over low heat, slowly consumed to finally react violently in a gale of feelings that are impossible to avoid.And this is why one can love cinema. In addition to the entertainment that is often obvious, there are also human and realistic stories like these, where everything comes together so that a well-written script and a memorable performance are capable of breaking anyone. There are many topics touched on in this film that can be the source of a genuine debate, and even when they can be enriching conversations, Brendan Fraser's performance rises to silence everyone and deliver a high dose of emotions that unbalances any cold and calculating analysis. Both subjectively and objectively, Brendan Fraser should win all of the season's awards. The organization that thinks differently will be branded as criminal for eternity.In the technical aspects of the movie, the soundtrack has many moments of silence that are appreciated and others where it enters with a frenzy to complement the emotional package of images. The direction is austere, but efficient, with some very interesting shots to highlight every detail. The editing is impeccable. I am obsessed with good transitions, neat continuity and good cuts, and this is one of the few films that delivers a very high level of editing. And of course it is impossible not to notice the wonderful work of practical effects and makeup, where the protagonist of the film is transformed into a morbidly obese person.Watch this film with an open mind and eager to receive emotional, sharp, critical and humane drama, for this film offers all of that and more.",
  "Just Wow!!!": "Once again Aronofsky divides your own senses, toying your emotions, are you disgusted or empathetic?. The biggest comparison that can be made are the parallels with The Wrestler. Unlike that film, Charlie (Brendan Fraser) though physically repulsive does hit your heart strings, you cant help feeling emotionally connected very quickly. Aronofsky still has a presence in this film, set almost entirely in Charlie's living room every shot is done with purpose and adds to the films authenticity.Charlie is dying and with only a week to live sets to make things right with daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink) much to the disgust and apprehension of carer Liv (Hong Chau). As a English teacher Charlie is forever the optimist about his rebellious daughter's future. Wanting to leave this planet knowing he has achieved one success in life.If there is comparisons to The Wrestler then let it be, because as Mickey Rourke did before him Brendan Fraser will win the Oscar. This is a performance that will go down in history. This is just a wonderful film that will have in tears by Tuesday.",
  "Brendan Fraser I hardly knew thee!": "Brendan Fraser has been stereotyped as a sexy goofball who can't act his way out of a wet paper bag in ridiculously silly movies for many years. However in The Whale, he completely transformed himself into a completely different character. He's sweet, kind and tender hearted man on the verge. He's extremely obese, has high blood pressure. I suspect he also suffers from\nSevere depression. Was. It's hard to watch him struggle when he's trying to things that we mostly take for pgranted. At times it's hard to watch it but mostly it's fascinating and gives you the feels. He definitely earned his Oscar Nomination.",
  "Well": "We must always start any cr\u00edtica by thanking moviemarkers Who try to being something to entertain us and if possible leave a message.Here, the director tr\u00edes to do both but his whole work is like the film set. It's a film that moves in circles and everything seems confined. After 40 minutes you already know what you need but nothing more is explored until the very end.The cinematic approach is a mistake in the sense that the power of cinema is badly exploited. There's only a scene where the director plays us a visual trick, but nothing more.It's a movie that works because of the outstanding acting.The music works fine but as an emphatic effect. It's simply irrelevant as a theme/motif in the movie.In terms of plot, I believe that in the World of inclusion, this story portrays the hypocricy of human beings but puts it's weight on cristianity so much, it seems that is an anti-christian story. All characters seem show a reedemable side except the cristian.",
  "Forced me to FINALLY start my DRY FAST!": "At the end of this film The Whale I loudly told the audience i am 40 pounds overweight and I am starting a Dry Fast right effing now because I am NEVER going to end up like this EVER! This is one of the most important movies ever made.Read Sun & Steel by Yukio Mishima the greatest essay of all time free PDF online to discover the exact opposite of what Brendan Fraser's character was doing. Btw Mishima was bisexual and 3 time Nobel Literature nominee so I'm surprised there was no mention of him from this character who truly is a phenomenal English writing teacher btw, a solid direction from Darren Aronofsky and a jaw dropping performance from Brendan Fraser who truly deserves the Best Actor Oscar and a stellar performance from Sadie Sink who plays his daughter.I would've cried if the ending was different, I wasn't so angry at the nurse for feeding him chicken in the opening scene, and at myself that it took this long and this movie to finally shock me into action. You CAN end up like this.Btw some truly revolting scenes so be warned I was holding my hand in front of my face and staring away at points verbally exclaiming WTF at points. Most of the audience was sobbing in tears at the end and I could see reflections of parts of my own psyche in this film.If you have weight to lose or know someone who is obese which is 2/3rds TWO THIRDS of America then go see this and drag them with you.Ttyl I'm gonna go see Everything Everywhere All At Once to recover from this and enjoy myself 2 days into this dry fast. Btw THAT is a very fun movie truly deserves the Best Picture Oscar the single most creative film I've seen in decades.",
  "A movie for the sake of an acting!": "What I think makes a movie truly great is how beautiful it is. In cinematic domain, this translates into how well it captures the imaginations of the trained and/or aesthetically gifted audience, by incorporating maximum possible elements the movie's made out of.Sometimes a movie neglects some or most of those elements and focuses on some other, in which case, the movie can be considered as a cinematic achievement (vs masterpiece or simply a great movie) only if that focus ends up delivering extraordinarily.With this introduction, The Whale is, at best, of the second kind of these movies and can be considered as a cinematic achievement in acting (Brandon Fraser) and ... well, that's it!Darren Aronofsky, one of the most original of despicably unoriginal body of directors in Hollywood today, has done everything he could to not do much about anything in this movie but those that could help the lead actor deliver his best; and he absolutely does so!",
  "Incredible Acting w/ Strong Weaknesses in Dialogue": "The acting was moving from the entire cast but unfortunately dampened by superfluous dialogue and irrelevant side quests.The intention is so obvious in the film by makeup, the fat suit, grotesque eating scenes, dim lighting, and even the boxy aspect ratio that we dont need to be asked by Fraser whether \"you think Im disgusting\" that many times to feel claustrophobic. We get it. Moreover, how many times do we need to underscore the resentment behind him leaving his family? Its the same resentment which is articulated the same way every time. His teenage daughter is rebellious and misunderstood because she plays a rebellious and misunderstood teenager - but also, that is what her mother said. The boy, I dont even know why he was written in at all. He had an obstacle that had nothing to do with the overall story. The film seemed like a stageplay where every word aims to reassert what we see so that we are especially sure what's happening. It's not necessary for anything that I can pause and rewind.The apogee of the film is the discussion between Fraser and the young man (who could have been anyone), and that's where I think the film finally comes together after nearly 2 hrs. And it is a decent payoff. He has become disgusting and the physical embodiment of the guilt and shame that he feels after the death of his lover. With so much revolving around religion, his profession and even Moby Dick, it felt like so much could have been left out.",
  "No Entertainment and worthless": "When I heard the hype of this movie from critics, I should've stayed away. High ratings from critics normally equals disappointing or extremely bad movies! This movie is sad, depressing, has no entertainment, and most of all, there are no explanations to the story itself. It's like you dropped into the middle of some unimportant story of a persons life and watch it for a couple of hours and move on. Some acting is ok, but the entire movie is dark, feels cold, depressing and leaves you with an ugly taste in your mouth. I have no idea why Brendan Fraser would pick a role like this. Definitely not worth it.",
  "It was surprise": "I knew Brandan Fraser can pull some good dramatic acting, but he tops any expectations. I was curious how fat Fraser will take on super obese Charlie. I am not disappointed.The story telling is also brilliant. Story with hidden element that is referred often but slowly being presented. It provides something that binds all characters together while providing some answers the more details are disclosed. It worked brilliantly without needless use of flashbacks.The weakest point to me is Thomas character which seems occasionally out of place, to the point of being fairly irrelevant in the connection to the rest of the story.",
  "verry good": "This was truly an experience. I went into this with very high expectations and I can truly say they were exceeded. I looooved this movie. It is clearly based on a play, and if you can accept that from the start and just take it all in, this movie really takes you into emotional spaces i didn't expect.At some parts I admittedly laughed when I shouldn't but when the film reaches culmination it's impossible to not be taken by the beautiful agony of this tale.The film has no hero or villain. Everyone is made out to be both to an extent and it's heart-wrenching to come to know these people throughout the film and watch them seek redemption.Some have criticised the screenplay as melodramatic-I didn't find this to be the case. I found it largely authentic, tragic, and full of intrigue that compounds as more information is revealed.My only glaring issue with the film is that one of the characters starts out as complex and with a singular nature, only to have that completely altered, oversimplified, and abandoned in his final scene. It seemed to me that this was done for the sake of the desired themes but at the expense of the character.But Brendan Fraser's performance alone marks this film as a colossal triumph, and there is much excellence to be seen throughout its entirety.",
  "Welcome back Brendan Fraiser": "This is one of those rare films that gives hope in the darkness of places. Fraiser's performance is both honest, heartbreaking and challenging simultaneously. The direction is solid and the character beats are moving and surprising. Every moment isn't perfect but boy is it a great journey to be on as an audience members. Touching and sad, with clear themes and genuine performances. Nice to see human stories like this in the space again.The cinematography is interesting without taking away from the actors. The writing is stronger than much we see today, without reaching the level of genius. Watch it!",
  "A Morbid Tale of a Guilt Ridden Father": "The Whale is a devastating film just like The Father but with better music and more committed performances.The movie does have it's moral flaws and some of the dialogue is so cute throat but for the most part it creates sympathy to all characters involved.Rob Simonsen's score was the USP of the movie, especially in the climax it feels like you are teleported to another world.Brendan Fraser couldn't ask for a better return. He really transformed into this role and it wasn't just the prosthetics doing the job this time. Aronofsky movies are known for the morbidity but The Whale really offers some home when it ends.",
  "The worst movie I've seen in my life": "I am giving this 0 stars for so many reasons. First and foremost, it's just unbelievably offensive. The implication that fat people are only fat because they eat fried chicken and candy, when obesity is a socioeconomic problem, is incredibly fat phobic and irresponsible. The suggestion that this man would have a gross, sad, pathetic life just because he is obese is horrible. This movie is damaging. All that aside though, it's just a bad movie. The dialogue is campy and cheap, the theme is so muddled, the cinematography is boring, and the acting is subpar. Hung Chao tries her best, but her acting is just laughably bad. Brenden Fraser is okay but he can't save this horribly written of a character. Sadie Sink has no depth. I am not exaggerating when I say this is absolutely the most awful movie I've ever seen.",
  "Brendan Fraser is an absolute genius": "Alright, I have a few things to say about this here film.First of all, the best part of this film is by far Fraser's performance. 10/10, give him all of the awards. I can't believe he was able to give such an emotional, heartfelt performance to the likes I've ever seen. I think this is not only the best acting role I've seen this year, but also the best acting role of the 2020s so far. Additionally, Hong Chau was amazing as well. During her and Fraser's one-on-one scenes, I forgot I was even watching a film.Also, absolute shout out to the makeup, cosmetic, or whatever other teams that made Fraser look so authentic on the screen. I have absolutely no idea how they made him look so realistic. Unbelievable.With this said, the ensemble of other roles was made made this film hard to watch at times. 8 hours after watching in the theatre and I can't even remember what purpose was the Thomas character necessary for. It didn't help that Sadie Sink pretty much played the exact same character as Max from Stranger Things.All-in-all, this film will always be Fraser's masterpiece to me.",
  "Painful...but worth the watch.": "I went into this movie expecting an incredible performance by Brendan Fraser and his co-stars. I did not expect to have so much of our current culture challenged. I don't think any spoilers aheads...but will mark it spoilers to be safe.This movie, like literature or poems or song lyrics, I think has to be interpreted by each person that watches it. I am sure many people will get many different things out of it.This tackles our culture of living live in front of a screen, obesity, out of control health costs, adultery, religion, homosexuality, complex and hurtful relationships, etc.What I got out of it is that primarily the main character through being hurt and hurting others had learned that life is about loving and caring for others and forgiving each other for the mistakes we make.It should win multiple Oscars IMO.",
  "Perfect but ... !!": "This movie is really a very good movie. But as long as there are some minor things that spoil the content or the dramatic sense of many great films.The final shot, in which actor Brendan Fraser ascends to the sky as an expression of his death, is exaggerated. The way this shot was filmed makes us feel that the movie went away from its content as a drama movie to give us the feeling that it is a science fiction movie.From the first shot in the movie, we are living a realistic, dramatic movie that always shocks us with the bitter reality that the main character lives in, and as long as the director shocks us with this reality through dark lighting, script, and dialogue between the characters.And I always expected that the movie would go in this way until the last shot in the movie, which was supposed to be more influential in the scenes, but unfortunately it was more fantasy.I would have liked to give this movie more than 7 degrees for rating, but I think that 7 degrees is very sufficient for the effort that was made in this movie, which would have been crowned with much success if the last shot was different and more influential on the viewers.Thanks.",
  "Negative reviewers don't understand the story": "This is a movie centered around an antagonist suffering from his own guilt and self-hatred. He is surrounded by protagonists that we only get to see from his perspective. We get to watch an abhorrent antagonist suffering at his own hands to his lowest point.The antagonist is the whale. He's the whale because the whale is not the point of the story. It never was. We all have our own white whale, and his obesity was the downfall of chasing that whale. We get to see hope of the protagonists in their final moments being able to devoid themselves of theirs.This film has zero to do with obesity. If you think that a character being fat or that being fat really meant anything was the point of the film, you just don't understand any of it.",
  "Reviving": "A well layered movie that needed to be told. With performances that are astounding across the board every character is like a book that you can't judge by their covers and have many chapters of interest . The movie does a great job of bringing the characters together full circle with their development although a couple questions are raised with the daughters intentions that i quite don't understand not to say i didn't like her role just felt the explanation for her demeanor towards the outreach boy wasent justified but it did resolve towards a nice conclusion for his character, overall good filmmaking on all ends .",
  "Don't forget to see Brendan Fraser's other movie Gods And Monsters 1998.": "In fact I have found a connection between the two films. Both the main characters in those movies were homosexuals. Gods And Monsters was about the homosexual director James Whale whereas this movie is called The Whale. The themes are the same in both films.The film portrays homosexuality as a guilty conscience perceived by the main character(Charlie portrayed by Brendan Fraser). He plays a closet homosexual even though he was in a straight marriage at the time. His lover, Alan, committed suicide due to religious guilt. This causes a remorseful Charlie to start binge-eating, the result of which causes him to become overweight to a point that it causes a terminal illness whereby he has a short time to live.Because of this fact, Charlie wants to make amends with his teenage daughter and find peace.I first saw Brendan Fraser in The Scout(1994). After that I saw many of his good films: George Of The Jungle(1997), The Mummy(1999) and The Mummy Returns(2001). He has a special place in my heart as a charismatic actor that can make you laugh. It's a great tragedy that this actor was not cast alongside Macaulay Culkin in a comedy movie during the early 1990's.Verdict: a decent drama movie about redeeming oneself.",
  "Excellent character story.": "I enjoyed this film a lot. It didn't seem perfect. Especially the last 20 or so minutes. But I found the story very compelling, and if you ask me, the story is nearly always the most important part of a movie's construction. The acting of Brendan Fraser might be overblown as the key or best part about this film. He did a fine job. But I thought the entire cast was fine and that Brendan has received a lot of love because he was so visually transformed for the role and his character is so central to the storytelling and is given so many opportunities to demonstrate deep emotions over the course of the runtime.There are a few interesting story reveals which I thought were disguised pretty well so the typical audience member might not predict the outcome. The directing choice as well to have the movie in a 4 to 3 aspect ratio seemed to support the movie effectively. Not only did it help with the framing for certain closeup shots. It also helped envelop the viewer into the narrow world in which this story takes place and keeps focus on the characters within the narrative as opposed to providing a lot of background space to distract from the characters.One other note for the film. The sound and score were typically subtle and a good supportive part to the storytelling. A lot of times brash and garish music is applauded by reviewers when IMO it's too much and a distraction and detriment. This film probably doesn't have a lot of people commenting on the music and sound. But that doesn't mean that it wasn't good and effective for the movie. I felt it fit really well. Overall the movie is great. You just might not want to watch it if you're in the mood for something cheerful, light or fun. You ought to be in the mood for a serious drama if you're going to watch this and appreciate it.",
  "\"Do you ever get the feeling that people are incapable of not caring?\"": "Honestly, one of the greatest films I've ever watched. It's brilliant.It's actually pretty hard to point a finger at any flaw. I couldn't find one.I'm not exactly a fan of drama movies, but this one keeps you invested from beginning to end. It's not just a melancholic story that makes you sad. It is, for sure, a sad narrative but still it is really enjoyable. I personally find it hard to write an essay about the movie that is as great as the one written about moby dick.The narrative is so well written. The fact that you can't know how Alan died until the very end of the movie is really engaging. Not only that, the same thing Liz says to Thomas when they go for a little chat in the beginning-ish is said in the end when Charlie talks about Alan and how he didn't need God and Charlie was the only one that could help him. Anyways, cinematic parallels.It's a really great movie, so well done and performed. It doesn't make the film ordinary or uninteresting the fact that the main character dies at the end. Nonetheless, it would probable be a pretty bad ending if he would have actually survived. I believe that the last scene is open for interpretation, since you can't know if he died in the couch and he imagined he managed to walk towards the light and Ellie, or if he actually did that and just died literally in front of her. Both ways, it's a great ending, because I think it made her realize how much life wasn't easy for him and even if he messed up, which he did, he never stopped caring about her.",
  "It's a perfectly built construction from start till the end": "The film was constantly keeping attention and focus on the characters and dialogue and every minute of it gave power to the story telling. The characters sometimes seemed weird or unusually played but looking back after the end it all makes sense.I didn't find a moment that didn't fit. Filming and colors and even the old screen ratio for very well with all the was happening on the screen. Soundtrack was very well underlining and it's eerie instrumentation was also flawless.The story kept giving new details just in the right pace making room for the next piece in the puzzle and emotional journey.Now, when rating the movie, I couldn't find anything I would have changed in it if I had the job to do it. So it's a 10/10 movie, which is very rare in my list of good movies. Congratulations for all the ones who did this.",
  "An outstanding work or art": "I found it to be an exceptional and groundbreaking work of art.

  "Selfish love hurt others but selfless love hurts yourself": "The plot is difficult to understand but it is okay. The movie moves slowly and might feel bit boring at some points. But it is very realistic and might even portray life of the viewers in someway or the other. The movie is bit dark but it support the inherent darkness of the plot. The viewers should watch the movie very carefully to spot, realize and understand the signs and situations that might feel like have no sense but are crucial to understand the plot.Acting of Brendan Fraser is flawless and almost unbearable at times. Sadie sink, Hong chau, Ty simpkins and Samantha Morton also play there roles nicely.Overall a very good movie and recommend for mature age category.",
  "A lot to love, but not Aronofsky's finest...": "Brendan Fraser marks his long-awaited return to the big screen with an unexpected performance in Darren Aronofsky's The Whale.Based on a play with the same name, Aronofsky's unconventional drama tackles a broadly unexplored topic in cinema, morbid obesity. It's a brave challenge and one that in some scenes hits the mark almost too bluntly, taking a (excuse the pun) somewhat ham-fisted approach to exploring the topic.Aronofsky has an uncanny knack of creating a dream-like space in almost all of his back catalogue, helped in part by his long-running director of photography: Matthew Libatique. The duo took the decision to present The Whale in a 4:3 format helping to create a feeling of claustrophobia and desperation throughout its nearly 2 hour runtime.There is plenty to appreciate about the film, the performances being a major highlight. Sadie sink in particular is a commanding presence, stealing attention in her scenes whilst managing to still be unwelcome within the context of the story. Fraser's performance has rightly received wide reaching plaudits and an Oscar nomination, thanks chiefly to a heroic dedication to the role. I did however expect just a little bit more after hearing all the praise before watching the film.There are some moments of real devastation interspersed with very little positivity, making the film somewhat difficult viewing which clearly was Aronofsky's intentions from the get go.It's hard to compare The Whale to anything currently in theatres, instead it's much easier to compare to Aronofsky's back catalogue in which I'd say the film somewhat falls short. Though to be fair there are some real heavy hitters to follow.I thoroughly enjoyed the film but would be sparing with my recommendations as it's clearly not for everyone, never has the term 'viewer discretion is advised' been more apt.",
  "A brilliant eye opener; superb in every way. A must!": "Brilliant acting, direction, dialoge, camera, lighting, storytelling, sound --specially sound; all weaved to shake the audience into reflection of all we find repulsive, despicable and that we try to avoid every time. Shaked me to the bone.Shocked me into understanding of all the people I've tried not to be all my life; the people we all tend to dismiss without a second thought. Broke and smashed all my paradigms.Hit me hard and destoyed my points of view about all the people with whom we interact on a dayly basis and fail to understand what they are facing in their own existences.I'll never see the obese, the laggards, the alcoholics or addicts, the do gooders, rancourous, fanatic and superfluos of the world in the same light again. Forced remove the \"why don't...\" from my thoughts forever.Production as a whole is a masterpiece and, while leaving a lot untold, it manages to explain even the thickest skulled of us -myself included- that most of the folks in the world, even those who we believe have enviable lifes, carry heavy burdens that we cannot even imagine.Heck, it even made me appreciate Moby Dick, which I've read three times, and enjoyed more with each iteration, in a different way that I had never considered and would have never fathomed but for this film.",
  "'The Whale' Review- Aronofsky's Show Stolen By Brendan Fraser's Once-in-a-Lifetime Performance": "'The Whale', the latest offering from the ace director Darren Aronofsky is a gloomy, poignant and moving saga of a reclusive, atrociously overweight teacher's last days of life. The movie will be forever remembered for Brendon Fraser's stellar performance. The same Brendan Fraser who was known for the cheap 'George of the Jungle', unimaginative 'Bedazzled' or the gaudy 'Mummy' in our growing years has undoubtedly delivered his career best performance. Without an iota of doubt, this is one of the finest performances in recent years.The movie is almost entirely shot inside the living room of the protagonist Charlie where his life is recounted through his conversations with his caregiver, estranged family members, an outsider young kid and at times with the food delivery boy. The milieu is gloomy, dark and at times ominous, a signature style of Aronofsky. There is hardly any sunshine shown except in the climax, brilliantly in sync with the bleak life story of Charlie. The story follows a simple and linear pattern , quite a deviation from Aronofsky's earlier creations like 'The Requiem for a Dream', 'The Fountain', 'Black Swan' or even the less remembered 'Mother!'. But as always, the master craftsman never fails to give his audience a chance to cerebrate, introspect and believe.I have been pining for watching 'The Whale' since the day I saw the poster of the movie with an extremely obese Brendan Fraser's photo and the director's name on it. Even Jim Carrey, the master of comedy has given us underrated yet extremely nuanced performance in 'The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. Adam Sandler, the man behind all those cheap, slapstick comedies gave us 'Punch drunk Love' or the brilliant 'Uncut Gems'. Was it now Brendon's turn to shift his priorities and excel like them? As the movie ended, I had one opinion which I believe most of the readers will agree with. Brendan Fraser embarked on a journey hitherto uncharted by any of the actors of the genre where he belonged and this new version of him has surely given us something deserving a standing ovation. Acting with that much of prosthetics was a monumental challenge. Emoting with that countenance layered with so much of obesity was a herculean task to say the least. But when an actor sacrifices everything in his life in three years just to portray a character perfectly, even the constellations conspire to make the silver screen sizzle with his brilliance. This movie belongs to him. Every scene of the movie belongs to the morbid Charlie, his emotions, his mistakes, his pathos. There are scenes where it is rather difficult to keep your eyes dry as you feel for the misfortunes of Charlie. Other actors do perfect justice to their roles. Hong Chau has bagged an Oscar nomination for her role as Liz, the caregiver friend of Charlie. Sadie Sink as the estranged daughter did a fine job, though she was a bit irritating in a few scenes. Samantha Morton shines as Charlie's ex-wife. But in the end, it is Brendan Fraser who leaves you awestruck. Budding actors may follow this movie as a manual of perfect acting. Sheer class!This is not your regular family drama. This is not an escapist tale of a cosmetic world. This is real. This is hard-hitting and this is a movie made with pure heart. Aronofsky even though did not bag any nominations, his work has been a revelation and if 'Black Swan' is his best creation till date in my humble opinion and 'Requiem for a Dream' is a close second, this can be easily rated third in the list of the unforgettable movies of the illustrious director. His non-manipulative works have never ceased to fascinate me ever since I watched 'Pi' in the college days. And my serenade for his works continues. 'The Whale' is a must watch. If you believe the name of the movie is just based on the physical appearance of the protagonist, you are wrong. And that is the only twist in the movie. You are seriously missing something if you have not watched 'The Whale'. Happy watching!9 out of 10.",
  "Classic case of the emperors new clothes.": "What a load of pretentious drivel. Poorly made, boring, self indulgent, dull, nasty, whiney, annoying, wallowing, vacuous and depressing trash. I'd rather punch myself in the nuts for 2 hours than watch it again.Classic case of the emperors new clothes.Fraser is great but the writing is hollow and obvious. The direction is local drama school level at best.It hurts to see so much praise lavished at this stinking pile of offal.It's not like I wanted a happy end to the film but it really had no emotion weight. I cry at lots of films and this just left me bereft of any kind of emotional engagement. All the characters are just awful. All blaming something lazily for their own downfalls in a one dimensional way.",
  "Only a crying Brandon Fraser could make me feel feelings again": "A magnificent performance by Fraser and the whole cast. Fraser deserves this comeback.Another nod has to go to the amazing practical effects team who created the hauntingly realistic fat suit for Fraser. Incredible work. There were even a few emotional moments that almost teared me up.There are only a few nitpicky things I will mention. First, I knew the essay was written by his daughter the whole time. Also, the movie kind of abruptly ends. It is an ending. I guess I just wanted more.This is a wonderful movie and deserves all the praise it is receiving. Welcome back, Fraser. We missed you.",
  "Heart wrenching story": "I cannot stop thinking about this incredible movie. We saw it today and loved it. An outstanding performance by the cast, particularly Brendan Fraser. Watching him try to move, pick up items, shower, get into bed, or eat, all make you feel uncomfortable. It's like you're watching something you shouldn't. A glimpse into a life you don't want to know about, but can't look away from. His awkward relationships with those around him is hard to watch too. I sound like I didn't like the movie. Far from it! I adored this warts and all movie. Can we please just give Brendan an Oscar for one of the most incredible performances I've seen in a long time.",
  "Amazing performance from Brendan Fraser": "Who knew in 7 hells that Brendan Fraser had this much of an acting ability within him... I mean sure, he hasn't been cast much since \"The Mummy trilogy\" but damn. He absolutely blew me away with that incredible performance.But that is the obvious talking point, how about the lesser ones? Well, another compliment I would give is that beside Brendan, the other actors did decent jobs too and the sad score, especially at the end, really teared me up, and I rarely cry at movies. Then there was the story with Brendan's character trying to catch up with his daughter whom he hadn't seen in many years and the plot just rolls from there, which was pretty enjoyable to me. There's just ONE negative thing I got about this movie and that is that, no matter what, he refused to do the obvious thing helping him from a certain doom. I wont say what that obvious thing is without spoiling but people that has watched it will know what i'm talking about. That's the only thing that pissed me off, but other than that, this was incredible and i'm not sure whether Brendan has won any awards from this movie, but if not... He damn sure should win a ton of them.",
  "Fantastic comeback by Fraser": "Seems like Mr. Aronofsky is a sucker for comeback stories. After giving Mickey Rourke a place back in the spotlights in \"The Wrestler\", he does the same for Brendan Fraser in his latest film \"The Whale\" which Fraser repays in full.This is not the only similarity between the films though. Both deal with similar themes of deep personal issues with protagonists who are trying to reconcile and reconnect with their respective daughters. This for me represents the biggest flaw since it feels like the director already did a similar picture.Nevertheless, The Whale does have plenty of good things about it so let's focus on this one solely from now on.And the rain fell upon the earth for four days and four nights. Aronofsky makes the point to show that for each day that passes, we the audience can clearly see it's raining outside and thus ties part of the setting to the biblical themes that are threaded throughout the picture. The Bible quote is from the part about Noah, which was also one of his last three films that could now be well considered a somewhat thematic trilogy. The atmosphere in the film is gripping, greatly aided by the very good setting. It's constantly pouring, Charlie's (Brendan Fraser) apartment is dimly lit and all of the doors and windows are shut. You can almost smell the stale air, mixed with the leftovers from whichever food Charlie was eating on a particular day. Altogether, the atmosphere gives off a drab feeling which in turn helps to convincingly paint a picture about the main character whose physical appearance mirrors his many insecurities inside. Brendan does a brilliant job showcasing all of them in a manner that makes you sympathize with his on screen persona and while all of the actors' performances were convincing, his is tying the whole film beautifully, and is head and shoulders above the rest. In addition, all of the emotions coming out of the movie are mainly coming through his character as well and he transfers them to the audience impeccably.If you decide on seeing the movie be prepared that you're not going to be watching pretty scenes on a number of occasions. In a few instances, it felt like I was watching a horror film where the food was a victim. It is all done deliberately by the director of course and serves the purpose of portraying a person disgusted by themselves and vividly showing it. Fraser and Aronofsky make for a great team and together make Hunter's script come alive.",
  "I Wanted to Like it More": "The best thing that The Whale has to offer is undoubtedly the phenomenal performance from Brendan Fraser. He is for sure going to get nominated. In fact, I'd be very happy if he won. It's well directed by Aronofsky. However, I have a few issues that hold this film back from being great. The score. It's not bad at all it's just overused. The story is extremely similar to one of Aronofsky's previous films The Wrestler. And the last being that the ending did not really work for me on an emotional level. The Whale is a well acted, written and directed drama. But the unsatisfying ending and familiar story are huge drawbacks. I'd highly recommend it just for Fraser's performance alone.",
  "A Huge Eye Opener to Life": "If Frasier isn't nominated for an award for this film, it will be an oversight of gargantuan nature, pun intended. The film can be a little slow at times; it's obvious that this is intentional to set the earned monotonous backdrop/scenery of his life. This is perhaps the only mediocre point of the entire film. . I'm becoming a little numb (at least I've gone from annoyed as hell to numb) to Hollywood's requirement of demographic inclusivity of the LGBQT doctrine; however, it works well within the plot as it is written. The youngster playing the role of his daughter is such a natural emulation of a young Emily Blunt that I am wondered if she is truly related to her. Performances by every character in this movie tops the chart. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to hit the spoiler alert button because the ending was done so well, even though I still needed tissues.",
  "Fatso redux": "Forty-three years ago, Ann Bancroft wrote and directed a surprisingly good film with a somewhat offensive title \"Fatso.\" It starred the usually under-appreciated Don DeLuise, a gifted movie and television comic who was never self-loathing in his humor, as comics with body-image shtick tend to be. Fat wasn't a liability for him, yet it wasn't quite an asset either. He was an actor--a good one--by trade, making his movie debut in Sidney Lumet's \"Fail Safe,\" not Stanley Kubrick's comic satire of the same novel. An H-bomb falling on New York City is nothing to laugh at. Sixteen years later he debuted again in a dramatic role as Dominick, a lonely, forty-year-old with a food addition. Although not strictly a drama, like Darren Aronofsky's \"The Whale\" pretends to be, it does place a fat actor front and center, not a supporting or minor character. Bancroft's light touch with humor raises her material from maudlin to poignant. Consequently, DeLuise's Dominick is not just a tragic fat man, or an object of pity, but a man like any other, looking for love.\"The Whale,\" despite seeming less offensive than fatso, is a pretentious drama whose substance is mostly water weight. Aronofsky, it may not come as a shock to anyone, is not a director of subtlety and nuance--one need only view his body of work to come to that obvious conclusion. So his attraction to Samuel D. Hunter's blubbering, theater project is understandable, given the playwright's manipulative, get-out-your-handkerchiefs approach to telling a simple tale of a 600-pound man resigned to dying. It tugs and jerks so much at the audience, they might leave the theater feeling assaulted. However, on second thought, they might also feel they've been hoodwinked by a clever con artist, and Mr. Aronofsky's slight of hand.His ballast in this confidence game is the once amiable actor Brendan Fraser. His fat suit, the latex prosthetics, and sad Barney Google eyes work over time to win audiences' hearts, as their minds turn to mush. Fraser throws himself into the suit, surrenders to the role, in an effort to revive his derelict career and connect with his newly obese self, but fights a losing battle with believability. Needless to say, this is all very Oscar worthy--there's nothing the Academy loves more than an actor who transforms himself for his craft. The makeup department ought to get a nomination, too.Movies--great ones--have a way of transforming audiences. Weepies and tearjerkers do this well, the best without being distasteful. But after contemplating this one, audiences might reason that a movie about food addiction, obesity, and death is pandering, even offensive. What challenging role might Fraser tackle next, they wonder? Perhaps John Falstaff, Friar Tuck, or Fatty Arbuckle.",
  "Watch it ! Cinema !": "Huge Aronofsky fan here, he's my number one film maker. Every movie so far is a masterpiece since PI.I watched it last night,finally it came to Serbia. The film hit me deep in some corners of myself i thought were forgotten and rotten to dust.He always manages to surprise me,every trailer i am sure i have a grip of what the film will be,and always it's different. 500 stars for him,the fil and the actors.I will not say anything more,just - it is not for everyone's taste, and best to spend some time thinking about your own life,to enter that zone, and then watch this film.Darren, keep making miracles !!",
  "The Return of Moby-Dick": "I'm glad that the movie didn't turn into a low-level melodrama at the end (Ellie's emotional return at the final was enough for this story),I don't have a cruel attitude in this matter, I just don't think there is any need for pity in this world, The real world is not so colorful.Humans, when faced with the pain of another person, want to sympathize (if there is some humanity left in the person),Brendan played the role so well that I'm sure there are moments in this movie where viewers want to empathize with him by putting themselves in \"Charlie's\" shoes, Mr. Brendan Fraser, you are such a good actor that you were able to convey this feeling to the viewer, you played this role so well that for a moment the viewer can experience the true meaning of the word \"sadness\", I wish I hadn't seen this movie, now I'm sadder than before...",
  "Honesty!": "The first thing you notice is the 4:3 aspect ratio. I honestly didn't expect it and have to say that it fits perfectly. Brendan Fraser's Charlie seems even larger and more obese. The ceilings seemed that they were quite high but shrank when he strenuously stood up from his couch. Fraser's height of almost 1,9m definitely helped, because other actors looked tiny compared to him. Not to forget the admirable work of Adrien Morot who created the 600lb costume, which filled most of the screen on the nowadays not so often used aspect ratio.I liked the lighting. It was dim and melancholic. Just the kind I'd imagine a person who's locked up in his apartment all the time would have. The feeling of imprisonment was emphasized through the whole movie - most of it took place in Charlies living room.The acting was top class and induced goosebumps. Even though I sometimes felt that the screenplay was a little too much at some points, it didn't take away from the quality of all performances. In the first half the music was not remarkable but in the second half promoted anxiety and sadness. Some scenes were hard to watch - probably because they depicted the reality of things so accurately.The Whale touches topics such as addiction, loss, gluttony, self-destruction, faith, honesty, beauty of art, shame, and sexuality. That is quite a lot for one movie, and I felt drained at the end. However, I believe that Darren Aronofsky achieved what I value most about his work - to arouse all kinds of feelings and emotions. And even though I would rate it a little lower than for example Black Swan or Requiem for a Dream, it's still a rewarding watch.",
  "My 600 LB Life - meets The Father - meets 1934 Imitation of Life": "\"I must admit, the hype around Brendan Fraser in this film is well deserved.\"FINAL TAKEAWAYS:\nOverall #TheWhale gives My 600 LB Life - meets The Father - meets 1934 Imitation of Life* * *\nTheme & Story: B\nPacing: A-\nCharacter: A-\nOverall \"Paper\" Score: B* * *\nEntertainment Factors\nGeneral Public: Interesting Enough\nPsychological Drama Fans: Interesting Enough\nFilm Enthusiasts: Worth the $$$\nExperience Seekers (Twists & Feels): Worth the $$$\nOverall \"Viewing Experience\" Score: Interesting Enough* * *Yeah... Brendan Fraser gave a superb performance that deserves an Oscar.OTHER THOUGHTS:\nHighlights: Brendan Fraser's performance, the prosthetic work, Acts Two and Three, the active metaphor(s) for \"The Whale,\" thematic followthrough, and Hong Chau.Could've Been Better: The thematic continuity could've been tighter. Continuity definitely gets better in the later Acts, but something was missing in Act One to bind it all together for me. The pain and struggles plaguing Charlie was delivered to be due to the physical with a heartbreak attached, but I think it should've been a clearer and loud crashing intersecting of those ideas...or at least enough space in Act One, or via flashbacks across Acts, to give remanence of the latter to catch us up to where we were now with Charlie.",
  "This Is Cinema and This is Acting": "Has to be one of Darren Aronofsky's top-3 best films. An emotionally deeply touching story of a father. A beautiful & simple cinematography, very stage-like. A nice & perfect continuity editing and an outstanding acting by Brendan Fraser! This movie introduced me to this actor, what a performance !! Who holds the film together in a role that I hope will bring him the the Oscar, he deserves it. Also special mention to the climax of the film, the final minutes of the film which will bring tears to your eyes even if you're not an evolved movie-audience.Don't miss this one. I'm going to check previous works of Brendan Fraser!",
  "Boy what a film": "Yeah the story might be a little confusing but it's a awesome performance by everybody. The emotions and the reality of the situation is just heartbreaking.It's a avalanche of emotions that just comes rolling down on you and you don't event notice it. It perfectly exemplifies how we can get trapped and caught in our own feelings and just let go.The ending is at the same time warm and cozy while just throwing you a bucket of cold water in your face.Great chemistry between all the actors.I'm not easy moved but the last time I cried watching something was when Hodor died. So it as been a while.Awesome movie. I hope he gets the Oscar.",
  "Neglected in all fronts": "I'll say I'll enjoy one or 2 moments in the film. But the reality is that is is a weak Aronofsky. Is a convoluted mess. Very convenient to use a washed up actor like Fraser (is a guy many of us love cuz remind us a time in our lives where everything was easier) to manipulate the audience into feel something for a man who have decide to quit trying. There is many other more original ways to quit life. Is overly pushed into disbelief. It's unnecessary many of the events of the film and others are actually left out for no particular purpose. Is like Aronofsky live in an alternative reality where feeling sorry for yourself at 40+ is an original way to say I'm sad of my life choices or life is unfair or poor sobbing buddy. The movie has no heart but a silly poor written story about nothing. Nothing special, Fraser doesn't deserve anything here. Take out Fraser from this story and u couldn't care less.",
  "I'm 34, Male. I've seen thousands of movies. This was my favorite :)": "First off, I found this movie to be near perfect. Every character had a reason. I've read the negative reviews, I get it! But to me, i can look passed a lot of things if the movie can change me. Not many movies I've seen where I left a theater a changed person. This had the biggest impact on me out of any movie I've seen. It's a must watch for anyone who wants to be a better person. It's up there with the greats (Shawshank, The Fundamentals Of Caring, etc).Every character was somehow woven into the movie perfectly like I've never seen before. Even the delivery guy was memorable and had meaning. Every scene, every comment, every action, all seemed to have a purpose. That's an impossible task as a director/writer. I'm\nNot sure how the heck the director did this movie but it was dam near perfect in my eyes.My gf passed away Feb 2nd 2023 and I saw this in theaters a week later. It really moved me and has helped me cope. It's a must watch for anyone who enjoys movies with deep meaning. Those who don't like it are probably younger folks or very religious. It's definitely not for everyone but the greatest movies imo are movies you have to think about deeply. I still think about it! I feel this movie will never be topped for me.I rarely write reviews but I had to for this one. I wanted to thank the director for making this into a beautiful movie that moved me in a way that made me a better human being after seeing it. I can't say that about many movies. It was pure art. I can't wait to buy it and rewatch it to understand more. The acting as unbelievable. Everyone did such a good job.10/10 A+ Perfection in my eyes because it shows all the flaws of humans. Every emotion was triggered somehow. That's art. Loved it. Thanks to all who created it. Extreme talent <3.",
  "One room scene keeps mesmerising attention": "A fantastic performance from all the cast makes this the movie of 2023.The movie is set in Charlie's house that's it for the location, however it doesn't matter it makes viewers emerge into Charlie's life.Charlie is a college tutor who is morbidly obese and is house bound. He gives classes online and never shows his camera image.Since he left his wife for a man who died he has been ostracised by his daughter and wife.Reaching a stage of near death he decides to try to reach out one last time to his daughter. His carer is fond of him as a friend and knows he wants to die and tries to persuade him to seek medical help but he is reluctant to spend money and in a way is succumbing to the thoughts of letting himself go to end it all.A truly brilliant performance and skilful writing makes this a must see movie.Even though a single set location it matters not you will be captivated in his anguish and pain for the duration of the movie.Incredibly moving and thought provoking.Best Actor oscar is my prediction.",
  "Brilliance beyond no doubts": "I'll keep this quick.Brendan Fraser has come back from oblivion and what a movie for him to mark his territory!Never have I felt so moved from such a captivating performance by Brendan. My uncomfortableness at the start of the movie was in major contrast to the ending... Sadie Frosts performance was undeniably her best!My tears at the end of the movie was completely reasonable for the enduring performances, held by all the actors of this movie.Darryn Aronofskys direction was on par with the brilliance of the movie itself!The only problem with this undeniable cast, is that Sadie Frost was not nominated for an Oscar!",
  "Redemption comes at a heavy price": "This is an extraordinary movie in many aspects, almost entirely shot inside an apartment we are told the story of morbidly obese recluse teacher Charlie who just wants to spends his last days with his estranged daughter, His Daughter as we later meet her is described by her own mother as evil! And most certainly is not not a nice person, compared to nice polite and docile Charlie his ex wife and daughter are both uncouth loud and unsociable, the thing is how they are and how they act is because how Charlie had treated them , when he was married to his ex wife and had an eight year old daughter Charlie had fallen in love with another and had left his family what he did not only broke his wife and daughter but also destroyed his own life , Charlie as we meet him is a broken man whose only remaining wish is to reach out to his daughter, but as he and all of us learn redemption is no easy job, and there may be a time when a father who abandoned his own child has sacrifice his own life to have it .",
  "Uncomfortably Beautiful": "This was never made to make the audience relax back in their couch with popcorn and soda and have 2 hours of entertainment. So this is not for the people who turn towards cinema to momentarily escape the reality of their lives.This will disgust you, make you uncomfortable and eventually break you. But when the credits roll, one can not help but appreciate how convincing the performance of Brendan Fraser has been. The film has it's fair share of flaws ( who knows those can also be intentional) but at the end if a movie manages to make you feel and resonate with character(s) who are far from \"perfect\" and likeable , I think it has done it's job pretty well.",
  "In 2022 it's no surprise there's so much praise for this film..": "I honestly felt NOTHING after watching this movie. The way that Charlie is portrayed is indeed sad but also tacky too. Sound effects, grease stains and a lot of sweat will definitely get the intended message across, heck even the title name adds to the flair. I could not become emotionally invested in Charlie and his downfall caused by a relationship that should have never existed, it's actually maddening. The whole thing shot in the confines of a small apartment...doesn't translate to the big screen. A play is what it is. Fraser was great as were the other performers. They were just doing it in a not too great movie. The opening scene was so unsettling and in that instance my doubts were already setting in. I wish I passed on this because there's better stuff out there to fill seats at the cinema.",
  "A Painstakingly Brilliant Classic": "A film which will make you speechless. Brendan delivers a masterpiece performance throughout the movie which he completely carries over his broad big shoulders. In every scene his acting is superlative and deserves every award this year including the Oscar. I would be praying & rooting for his win during the Oscar ceremony. What a mammoth of an effort by this Man!!Hong Chau & Saddie Sink play supporting roles big time and deliver their best. The father-daughter scenes keep us spellbound and are totally heart touching. The positivity in Charlie's character will surely be a life changing lesson for everyone who watches the film. My heartfelt salutations to the director Darren Aronofsky for choosing this subject and etching such great screenplay. The camera,editing and background score are top notch. Go watch it at a theater near you & My dear Brendan you go win an Oscar!!!",
  "Reality, just like that.": "I can't believe that's this actor or any actor could do this for real, he made me think many think for my life, he made me mad and sorry for many things, I didn't stop crying thinking of the wrongs I made in my own life, i tried many time to hold my tiers not for him but for my life, he didn't make me cry because of his problems but through his acting he made me realize so many thinks we take for granted, thank you for sharing your talent and giving us the opportunity to understand and see more clearly, I will never forget the thoughts you made me realize and I will always remember that day I came to theater to see a drama and not an action movie.You deserve the Oscar for sure.",
  "\"The most depressing S*#T I've ever seen in my life\"": "Okay so my wife and I knew this was going to be an emotional movie and it is,At the end of the movie, 2 young teens walked down past us, slowly, like they had just recovered from a disorienting gut punch. They were shaking, holding their popcorn close to their chests. They had this genuine look of total shock in their faces. As they passed us, the one leaned towards her friend and whispered with a shaky voice \"that was the most depressing S*#T I've ever seen in my life!\" Those poor girls didn't know what they were going into with this movie. I think they were in shock. It's an emotional gut-punch so I don't blame them. My wife and I couldn't help but laugh at their remark. It's sincere and honest. This is an emotional movie but it's a story that we all NEED to see.It's fascinating how there are scenes that are clearly intended to make you completely grossed out with how incredibly obese and unhealthy this individual is... yet instead of being repulsed, you can't help but genuinely fall in love with Charlie regardless of how morbidly obese he is. It's a fascinating juxtaposition and that aspect, coupled with an incredibly visceral storyline and heartfelt performances, makes this a must-see cinematic masterpiece.It's great, enjoy!",
  "She is tremendously manipulative, but utterly captive.": "Darren Aronofsky's cinema tends to divide critics and viewers in the same way because he is a director who always likes to give us films that generate debate, discomfort or rejection among those who receive each proposal that the filmmaker gives us.This time he is no exception to the rule and once again we face the discord of loving or rejecting his new film.The fact is that we have before us a film quite different from what the director has accustomed us to, especially if we go to his previous film Mother!. On this occasion, the director takes us through a much more conventional film, but one that does not stop having that feeling of love and hate on the part of the critics and the viewer towards what the good Darren Aronofsky proposes to us.The film adaptation of the play by playwright Samuel D. Hunter, who also writes the film's script, is its great strength for us to face a film that manages to become a wonderful work to watch and enjoy, despite the fact that We clearly have an exploitation on the part of its director to look for that sentimentality and that position of compassion or perhaps hatred for the character of Charlie.If we have to talk about the sensations that Charlie generates in us as spectators, we must start by mentioning how brutal it is to see an impressive performance by Brendan Fraser. What the actor does is insane, it is without the slightest doubt the best performance of the actor throughout his entire career and possibly the best performance of the year. What the actor does is transmit with just his eyes and with his expressions, years of suffering and regrets for Charlie, and if we add to that what he does physically with his character is simply hypnotic, you forget that it is Brendan Fraser who acts and you see Charlie at all times.It is also thanks to the actor that the film manages to reach that step of almost perfect work. If The Whale will be remembered for something, it is for what the actor does, it is his film, it is his moment of consecration.Going back to what its director gives us, I can certainly agree with the vision that he gives us a totally manipulative film in terms of managing our emotions and our feelings about obesity or the guilt of a certain character that the story addresses, but we must Give the director that it is a film that makes you participate in a moral questioning and also a capacity for tolerance on the issues that the film addresses.We are facing a film that makes us question several things and that also bombards us with millions of allegories and metaphors taken to the cinema in maximum expression and that is one of the great points that the director always has, always making his films with a full cinematographic language. Of details that make you reflect.It is a really distressing and really heavy film when the time comes for the credits you end up with a really distressing load on your shoulders and the intensity that The Whale transmits is really a slow process to digest, however, this is a great film that It can be manipulative or condescending, but no one can dispute that this is a truly impressive and brutal film with a heart-breaking lead and supporting performances just as impressive as its lead.A film that is worth every second of its viewing and its internal and external debate about what we end up seeing.It is cinema and The Whale is an impressive work.",
  "Truthful, Honest": "Darren Aronofsky has yet to disappoint, His movies are awesome! Instead of repeating what everyone has said about this film, I wanted to add that it was Liz, played by Hong Chau who really got me. Brendan Fraser was extraordinary in arguably his best performance, Sadie Sink was incredible as Ellie, his daughter, and Samantha Morton is great in everything she does, but watching Liz as Charlie's care taker and best friend was almost unfair and painful, inviting us into her eyes and soul filled with the past as well as the present inevitable tragic reality. I couldn't wait until she was back on screen with Charlie to watch this private and painful relationship, I found myself feeling saddest for Liz. Forget these bad reviews that point out the easily targeted stereotypes of obesity or the condescending critiques of a broken family, those people simply didn't intellectually connect with the characters, go see this incredible movie and experience what I believe is one of the most honest films I've ever seen.",
  "Brendan is back with heavy...performance": "It is a very sad story, where Brendan becomes an obese gay who works as a distance language teacher. He needs to recover the lost years with her daughter, so he takes advantage of the last moments of her life by educating her.Brendan's performance is sensational and real, I almost cried watching him. Sam's performance from Strangers Things is also solid.The director changes the ending to a poetic one out of the nauseating reality in which the protagonist found himself.The photography is well cared for in grays and blacks, especially with rainy moments and nights.It goes without saying that everything takes place inside a room, smelly and uncleaned. Therefore the art is also well cared for.",
  "Not worth the hype!!!!": "I found this movie to be extremely slow moving, with no point. Throughout most of the movie, Brendan Fraser does not act like a 600 pound man....he needed to watch more episodes of my 600 pound life! The movie dragged along with really no excitement as the story line was boring! I kept thinking......this has got to get better. I kept waiting for something to happen, but nothing really ever did. The makeup/body suit was done fairly well, except missing the skin imperfections usually found in people that size.I had waited too see this movie for months, only to be super disappointed. This is just my opinion.",
  "Emotional and necessary": "As I don't care about the criticism towards the film, I must say that I loved it. Of course the purpose of this film wasn't to be a fun thing to watch, so I understand why some people felt it was heavy.I appreciated every single minute. It made me cry. Made me feel all the possible emotions: empathy, sadness, affection, everything. Happiness? In the ending. What a marvelous ending.The script isn't necessarily trying to make you feel that there's a completely happy ending there, but for Charlie, he achieved what he really wanted: bring out the bright inner side on his daughter, the side of her that was capable to love him as a father, despite his flaws. This moment has shown that he was capable of the last thing he wanted for his life: to make his daughter understand she is a good person that he always thought she was, indeed. Now he's completely happy, he gave his daughter everything he wanted to give (so she wouldn't treat herself as badly as he treated himself), and now he can go nd rest in peace. I've seen this a happy ending. A very happy, real and human ending.Charlie cared so much about the others, even though he lost every important person in his life, that he left himself completely behind, since when he was gaining weight and locked himself inside an apartment to when he refused to pay for a health insurance to leave the money for his daughter. He still had an immensive amount of affection for the people that passed through his life. And I couldn't help but feel sorry for him, and have such a huge empathy for him.It's not about only obesity, not at all. You could replace obesity for any other emotional and psychological disease, and the final message would be still the same. Emotional, necessary and amazing.",
  "Cried many tears": "I went to theaters to see this film and it was incredibly emotional. The overall film was solid in terms of music, lighting, etc. The thing that stood out the most was the amazing performances that tell such a compelling and heartbreaking story.Brendan Frasier did an amazing job portraying Charlie and you could tell so much about him. He's a man who is in pain, emotionally and physically. Physically, he's overweight and struggles to do even the slightest of things. Even laughing can cause him to go into a coughing fit. Emotionally, he's lonely and only wants to reconnect with his daughter before he dies. He knows he has an issue with his weight but even when he feels like he should stop overeating, there's something that makes him realize he's too late. It is here where we see him torture himself in eating, stuffing his face with anything and it's clear to see he does it out of anger and frustration with himself. He knows the damage he's done to himself and knows he's close to death every moment. His interactions with Ellie (Sadie Sink) were the most entertaining to see. Sadie Sink's amazing performances recently show that she will be an absolutely amazing actor to see for the years to come. Hong Chau also gives a great performance as she produces some comedic relief but also gives moments of sadness. These three actors did an amazing job in their roles and were the biggest stars of the movie.The story was one that almost had me crying a few times throughout the movie, but once I reached the ending, tears came streaming down. Hearing the connection between Moby Dick, Charlie, and Ellie was sad and heartwarming. Seeing him walk up to his daughter with his final breaths. And the way they portrayed his death was beautiful. Rather than seeing him go limp and struggle to breathe, we see him being strong and having a final connection to his daughter before he ascends to the light. This makes the death one worth crying to but also happy about.One negative I do have is Thomas (Ty Simpkins). Not necessarily the performance or actor, but rather what his importance was. I don't feel like he has an incredible amount of impact in the story and yet he's given a lot of screen time. These were the times it went dull a bit and had me wondering why he was even on screen for so long. I understand that he was meant to show that Ellie wasn't all bad and that not everyone needs saving. But still, his significance wasn't worth all the time he spent on screen.Other than that, this is the movie to watch if you want to watch a moving story with incredible performances.",
  "Amazingly heartbreaking": "This film left me sobbing for a good ten minutes!!Fraser is utterly amazing in this. His performance is outstanding and deserves every nomination coming his way.It forces the audience to continue watching despite knowing all along how this will end. There's never even a hint of salvation but you just can't help but watch and see it through. You almost accept it early on along with 'the whale\"It's a story of life lost, mental health challenges and grief and the astounding effects they can have physically.It forces the viewer to face subjects they may be uncomfortable with such as obesity and look at it head on. A very thought provoking movie.",
  "Just wow": "Firstly I would just note that all the so called christians in this comment section are disgusting.Now that I said it, I'm going to say something about the movie.I've seen many reviews by now and watched the movie myself. First scene surprised me because I did not expect it but it was welcoming to introduce the main character.Now, the main character Charlie who suffers from obesity and depression after losing his boyfriend Alan, is an english teacher and you can tell he loves his job. He likes the creativity behind it, behind writing and loves when people are able to express themselves. I personally enjoyed his character as I also felt sad along with him as well as I could compare him to me, being a depressed person myself.The plot Isn't exactly a thriller, as I seen many people comment on it, so I never expected it to be thrilling or to have any action. It depicts a man who, through sadness, loneliness and broken heart also became obese and have fallen into ruin...becoming a shell of his former self. Thought it seems at times he finds joy in little things like reading an essay written by his daughter, teaching online english courses and food, he is still miserable and sad and only really has one friend.Now, I again saw many comments and i don't see the problem with him being gay. It's a story about a man who doesn't need god to save him and who misses someone he lost and who he loved dearly. Being gay has almost nothing to do with it apart from the fact we know he had a boyfriend.Moving on, the whole plot that revolves around him being in his flat people find boring, but I think many fail to see that this man struggles with anxiety, depression, self-confidence and obesity and thus does not want to leave the comfort of his own space he has created and where he feels most safe. It shows us how depression and anxiety and self-confidence can have a huge impact on someones social life and how, even if people might act all happy, could be dying inside.The ending, where he dies isnt sad or at least it shouldn't be. He was happy at the end. He knew he was going to die and he wasn't gonna deny it. He was happy because right there, right before he passed, he walked again and he heard his own daughter read her essay to him one last time. The essay he held most dear and would help him through a lot of hard times.The missionary kid was not needed. No matter how hard he tried, he should have realized that Charlie decided long ago what he wants in life and who he wants/doesnt want to follow/believe in. He tried helping sure, but by forcing HIS religion onto someone who DID NOT want it.Overall the movie was great. I cried from almost the beginning to the end. It touched me deeply and I never felt so sad and empty and lonely at the same time. It made me realize that the time we have is a short one. We better live it gratefully, without hate(how many ppl in comments do) and realize that life is so much more.Brendan is an amazing actor and I salute him for this role. The comeback he made, the acting, everything about this role is something that we usually would not expect to see take on, yet he did and he did it well.Well done Brendan <3.",
  "One of the best dramatic movie of the year": "Very good come back of Brendon Fraser. He is simply amazing. Performance of Sadie Sink and Hong Chau are phenomenal.. a reclusive and unhealthy English teacher, hides out in his flat and eats his way to death. He is desperate to reconnect with his teenage daughter for a last chance at redemption.it was hard not to cry at the climax..Although The Whale wasn't based on a true story, it was an intimate movie inspired by real-world issues of compassion, guilt, and human connection..Fraser was incredible as Charlie. The Whale Confirms Sadie Sink Is Stranger Things' True Breakout Star..That controlled rage was perhaps the most distinctive aspect of Sink's role..",
  "A thought provoking masterpiece": "Darren Aronofsky's latest movie, \"The Whale,\" is a cinematic masterpiece that is thought-provoking and emotional. The film is a standout among the great movies of this award season, and it is easy to see why. Brendan Fraser's incredible performance is at the film's heart, which marks a fantastic comeback for the actor. Fraser delivers a tour de force of a captivating and heart-wrenching performance.\"The Whale\" takes the audience on an emotional rollercoaster ride. The film is almost like a theatre piece as it revolves around a few amazingly written 3-dimensional characters and takes place in one apartment throughout the movie. This adds to the feeling of stage production and enhances the story's intimacy.The movie's strength lies in its ability to challenge viewers' views on various topics. The film forces the audience to confront their beliefs and preconceptions, creating an incredibly engaging and thought-provoking experience.Overall, \"The Whale\" is a must-see movie that will leave a lasting impression. Aronofsky has once again created a masterpiece that will be remembered for years. The performances are outstanding, and the story is both moving and poignant. This is a movie that should not be missed.",
  "I fell asleep writing this review": "Yep, that's how bad this movie is. How in the hell is it sitting at 7.8 has got me buggered. Did I fall asleep in the movie and miss the bit that warranted its rating?! Well, unfortunately I didn't fall asleep as I'd taken my 80 yr old mother to the cinema as we haven't done that in years. Halfway thru this snorfest, I suggested to Mum we should go. She said no, you chose the movie, and for punishment we're staying! So Mother and I get into an argument. Next minute the usherette (do we still call them that?) came over and asked us to keep it down. I was so embarrassed, but just as usherette was leaving, a guy further down piped up and said, Mate, let them go. It's the only bit of entertainment we've had for the last hour! (which brought some laughter into the place at my expense).Seriously though, this was boring, directionless, mind numbing garbage. And I'm being kind, only cause I like Brendon Fraser as an actor (not in this obviously). Don't believe the hype ppl. Save your money and sanity.Ps. My mother swears she's going to the solicitors to have me crossed off her will! (Jokes....well I bloody hope so!\ud83d\ude31).",
  "Modern Film Criticism Is A Joke": "This movie made me emotional in ways that few other movies have. Most of the criticism has been about how \"grotesque\" the food scenes are, and I don't understand how that's a valid critique. They'll defend violence in movies and then turn around and criticize this movie's realism of over-eating. It's not meant to disgust you; the disgust is a side-effect of showing how a person became 600+ lbs and the overall humanity surrounding obesity. The movie is intimately human, the acting and directing are top-notch, and Brendan Fraser deserves all of the praise he's received. Maybe you'll disagree, but at least give the movie a shot to decide for yourself.Side Note: I didn't want to say this, but after reading some of the user-submitted low review ratings, it's clear to me that most of the people writing them have both the IQ and emotional range of a rusty teaspoon... they probably also consider Marvel movies to be captivating and thought-provoking.",
  "Most heart touching movie for 2023!": "Amazing actors, great story! This deserves an oscar. The majority of us does not interact with obese people as they rarely ever leave the house. Unless you have someone in your cycle, you really have no idea what they are going through. It is a cruel disease that can mess with your mental health. Or they other way around. People struggle with all sorts of different things and usually it all starts with mental health. To me this movie was a lesson to never betray my principles, my ethic and to always stay true to myself no matter what. You will understand what I mean once you see it. It is really a life lesson.",
  "Great Movie": "The Whale has some fantastic surprises for the viewer. The juxtaposition of the characters, a slothful father and an energetic teenager is well played out. Brendan Fraser pulls off one of his deepest roles with true mastery and is wonderfully mirrored by the supporting actors. I would argue that The Whale isn't a movie to be watched repeatedly but without a doubt one to be watched at least once. Two hours flew by and the ending is emotional and very moving. Hong Chau and Sadie Sink are a great choice to support Fraser. Characters aren't split into good and evil but rather reflect true life with flaws and mistakes. Th facial expressions Fraser employs to portray his character are subtle but emotive.Worth a watch\ud83d\udc4d",
  "\"Being Honest\"": "Not many things bring tears down my cheeks. This movie could not have been done by any actor who has not personally felt that pain. A lot of this talent we see is raw emotion from Brendan's own struggles. He took on a role so vulnerable and intimate and people like me thank him for doing it. Probably the most powerful emotional movie I've seen in years.What a few people don't understand is the raw truth of life not always being beautiful. I've seen this man. I've been this man. Addiction, depression, and the feeling of being sorry is a truth to so many. This movie captures the raw emotion so many hide deep in a closet buried behind a fake smile.",
  "Outstanding": "You know the BAFTAs (and likely Oscars) mean less than nothing when Brendan Fraser gives one of the best performances in film history and loses out to an Elvis impersonator in an average movie.What a journey the Whale is as a movie. Heartbreaking and emotional. Riveting and you can't look away. A man I'm his living room evokes better viewing than billions of dollars worth of MCU and Avatar retread special effects.Every single actor in this deserves to be recognised for their outstanding work. The story is exceptional. Camera work keeps you engaged. Directing is great.One of the best movies in years.",
  "No beached Whale": "I saw this early release and while the story is not original by any stretch, the cast brings it home. This is an example of what good acting, directing, and producing does with a great staff that edits, and finalizes production. Its good storytelling without the need of CGI and big blockbuster ad campaigns tricking you to believe it is a good movie...a la most everything in Hollywood. Having been a fan of BF since the 90's it is good to see him back on screen after the small hiatus. Hopefully he returns to Hollywood now he has this gem, but if he decided to not, it would be one great movie to go out on. Go see it!",
  "Rubbish": "What a predictable and boring movie, what a waste of my time, the acting was as bad as I've ever seen. The mother was terrible, the daughter was even worst at acting, the character she played was horrible and not believable... the fake missionary was most likely a lead in his high school play, The enabler was most likely a good community theater actor. The story was lame, Save your money and your time and go see something else, Sad. Dark. Depressing. I hated this movie. Well, that's 2 hours I wasted & will never get back. Unless you like brooding, melancholic movies, with all completely selfish characters, don't go see this movie!Tarzan has fallen from the tree.",
  "I am at a loss of words": "This movie is unique in the sense that it made me cry. I do not remember when I last felt such strong emotions for a piece of art. Brendan Fraser is a perfect fit for the role and I asked myself if I should feel sorry for him or not throughout the whole movie. The cinematography is amazing as well, giving us an intimate and honest look into Charlie's life and struggles. This is a must-see for everyone who likes drama. I was fully invested in the movie from the beginning. I will most likely go back and see this masterpiece again, since there is probably a lot more to it than I forst noticed. E.g the birds who Charlie provides food for outside the window, however the birds never take the food. Why not? What does it symbolise?It is a bittersweet and touching movie, just like life itself.",
  "a brand new Darren Aronofsky film! some light-hearted wholesome drama I'm sure!": "Held together by a killer Brendan Fraser (don't worry sir, we will get you that Oscar), this film is a sweet poem of empathy that will leave most viewers blubbering. This film makes me feel awful inside and not necessarily, in a bad way. Aronofsky's films have always been known to make one feel empty, not in a dissatisfied way but in a way that someone just took everything that makes me feel warm and cozy and ripped it out of me. This film broke me.This film is based off of a stage play written by Samuel D. Hunter which is about an obese man hiding from the world, staying in his apartment to the detriment of everyone around him, including his young and estranged daughter whom he left along with his wife to be with a man named Alan with whom he fell in love. When Alan commits suicide, Charlie's only remaining purpose in life is to make sure that his daughter Ellie is going to be okay even when he's not going to be around.I knew I was not going to be able to hold back my tears when I first saw the trailer which gave me this impression of the film being dark and depressing and although it is dark and depressing with its undertones of guilt, remorse and religion; what essentially makes this film great is that in the end, it gives you a feeling that even though everything that has transpired throughout, Charlie's daughter Ellie is going to be okay, she is going to have a decent life. Making sure of this will atleast be the one thing that he, by heart knows, did right in his life.Even if this film polarizes you in its approach of guilt or its treatment of fat people (which a lot of people online are discussing about), there is one thing that you and everyone who watches this film will agree in unison that Brendan Fraser has given a performance of his lifetime. That too at a time when everyone least expected it. This is one of those performances where either the most suitable actor (Brendan in this case) does it best or it does not happen at all. Brendan's grounded approach to becoming Charlie is what makes his performance seem so organic and makes you sympathize with all he's going through and even if you know deep down that he's not exactly doing the right thing but, from his perspective, it's the only thing that matters to him and you want him to succeed at that. Sadie Sink also gives a razor-sharp performance as Ellie which I think might be her best role to date which just further proves why she was the highlight of the incredibly mediocre Stranger Things Season 4. Hong Chau is also the one who delivers the character perfectly. Her performance is basically us as the audience reacting to all of Charlie's doings. There is not really any complaints at all, in the acting department at least because, Aronofsky really knows how to pull performances. There is always that one actor in his films that absolutely kills it in their roles and we've seen it all the way from Requiem for a Dream, Black Swan, Mother! And now this. I don't know how he does that but it's just incredible. He has always been one of those directors (with the likes of Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, James Cameron, Ridley Scott, James Mangold, David Fincher and many more) who whenever come up with something new, it's like an event to me. A celebration of the seventh artform and what it truly stands for.This film's production design, camera work and lighting is also something that should be taken into notice. It really gives you that claustrophobic feel of being in one house all the time. The set lighting makes sure you feel that dark/depressed state of Charlie's mind and body and how tired he is of his own life committing one mistake after the other and just wants it to end.The one thing I can't really contemplate is that some parts of the film didn't really make much sense to me except for them just being there for plot progression and pulled me out of the film's other more organic approaches. For instance, there is this scene with Charlie and is wife which doesn't really make much sense only until the very end which just makes the film's runtime 10 minutes longer and I wanted them to get to the point already.I can't really recommend this to you because you might either find this film beautiful and cathartic (like I did) or you might find it empty and having no point to it. The latter can happen because the film wants you to empathize with Charlie after making him seem disgusting in the beginning by showing him masturbating to gay porn. It's either a hard hit or a complete miss and only you can decide it for yourself.",
  "I'm left speechless": "I'm just sitting here. Just finished the movie. And damn, what a movie it was. I've been sobbing uncontrollably for a few minutes. This incredible movie is in my top 10 movies of all time.Everything was just right. It really hit home for me. And it will for many, many moreThe acting, the emotions, the feelings, the EVERYTHING, is just beautifully perfect.Brendan Frasier has been a favourite actor for me since The Mummy days, and it was so damn good to see him again. Like seeing an old friend that you love. I hope he will get back more into acting.10/10 for me. I will definitely watch this more in coming years.",
  "Hits sharp in our hearts": "Darren aronofsky never dissappoints me with any of his works.Either they are minimalistic or maximalistic he takes us into a visceral surreal experience and provides an important message to all of us beings about obsession.Iam obsessed with Darren aronofskys obsession of showcasing obsession in his movies . I just really love it.And the whale does it the same. It's gut wrenching to be honest. It doesn't shy away in any ways. It justs hits us so rough and raw with it's content.Brendan Fraser, I mean he really is the man. I don't understand how this guy portrayed charlie but iam so shocked and mesmerised with his performance . He truly possessed the power of acting.And aside from him the performances of other characters were also great. Except I did not understand the motive of his daughters character.Doesn't know much about the play , but the movie is damn good to be on screen. This is movie is a gem . You should not miss it ever in your lifetime.",
  "Brendan! Brendan! Brendan!": "What a wonderfully acted movie by all involved. I was suspended into Charlies world ached, laughed and related to him and the burden of his physical and emotional weight.Watching this film is journey that I liken to trudging through emotional mud. I do not mean that in a negative way, it is only the truth of it for me. It was long before my eyes were welling up with tears.Brendan Fraser is a gem of an actor and I am hopeful he wins a much deserved Oscar along with Hong Chau, Sadie Sink and the extraordinary talent of Adrien Morot who created the very realistic body prosthetics. Everyone involved with this film deserves high fives.And I just gotta say, Darren Aronofsky is brilliant, I find enjoyment to complete love and admiration for his work. The beginning was a powerful start and the ending was no less than beautiful for me.",
  "People Are Amazing, But Not Perfect": "Even though it feels as if this movie has been out for a while, I was able to recently watch it in avant-premiere at my local cinema. Perhaps this is because of special screenings? Anyhow, I didn't know what to expect except for some award-worthy performances (from what I had read online). I certainly wasn't lied to.Every single performer knocked it out of the park on this one - Brendan Fraser as much as his co-stars Sadie Sink, Hong Chau and the others. I felt awkward crying in the cinema so I tried to hold it in, but it was an impossible task - though I'm pretty sure I wasn't the only one. I was very moved by their extremely human acting prestations.I absolutely adored the lenses this film was shot thru as well as the pretty 4:3 aspect ratio. For me, the cinematography captured very well the feeling of being stuck in this house which feels like a 'home' but simultaneously like a garbage dump. I don't know how to describe it, but sometimes I felt genuine horror. I don't know exactly what was so scary; the claustrophobic feeling, the inevitability of death or Charlie's lifestyle. Maybe a combination of it all.Furthermore, the soundtrack was just as heartbreakingly beautiful as the scenes it played along with. I also love it when certain parts of a story that might seem 'meaningless' or otherwise at random, eventually get called back to and mold together with the rest of the plot as one beautifully sorrowful story. All of it worked.The humanity of the characters is what makes this film so interesting to me. Though to be quite honest, I don't know what this film is trying to tell me. Perhaps it doesn't want to convey a deep message, but instead just show us how nobody is perfect because they're simply human. I don't know, but I loved it. Can't wait for the next A24 project!",
  "Oscar Loves Prosthetics -- SPOILERS!": "Oscar has always loved transformative makeup and complex prosthetics, so let's be honest, the real star of \"The Whale\" is the fat suit.The old stage play, recycled for the big screen, left me with that queasy feeling of gawking at helpless animals in a zoo, or slowing to stare at a car wreck on the side of a freeway. I don't know what was more unsettling in this film, the mawkishness or the cynicism. It's the perfect piece for our postmodern times, characters who are depressed, bitter, and completely incapable of achieving that dated Hollywood value of transcendence.A sweaty Charlie opens the movie with a disgusting masturbation session, and fills the next few hours stuffing his face with greasy pizza and oozing meatball subs. Then there's the in-your-face vomiting scene, which has become as common in recent productions as the fart joke. Is this really what qualifies as film making excellence?No doubt Brendon Frazier - and the makeup - carry the film. Sadie Sink was also strong as Ellie, but her character was so irredeemably toxic and malevolent it was repulsive. It made no sense to me that Liz, the nurse and sister of the deceased lover, wilfully ignored Charlie's pending demise and his his mental trauma, but dutifully enabled his food addiction. Why did she carefully measure his blood pressure each day, while failing to dial 911 and get him some help? The ex-wife was a bitter alcoholic unable to move beyond losing Charlie to another man. Her life's work was to stoke hatred for Charlie in their daughter, and here she succeeds in spades. Both Hong Chau and Samantha Morton could benefit from a few acting workshops.I'm not sure why critics love to laud \"complex\"and \"flawed\" personalities. The vision here the same old same old. Cynical, embittered characters, unable to move beyond their personal tragedies. The world is full of wounded people stuck in the past, and five minutes ago, the movies entertained and captivated us with stories of how sometimes, we could rise above it. Today instead, we get a close shot of a character vomiting in a toilet bowl. We've thrown in the towel on challenging people to rise up; but if we shed a tear or two for these unfortunate folks, please, feel free to gawk.If this movie made me cry, it would be for the two hours I wasted.",
  "How good can it be, right? It's the Mummy guy. Oh, I was so wrong.": "That's the \"George from the jungle\" guy, the \"Mummy\" guy. I know he fell off the face of the Earth for several years due to some personal issues, but that's how I remembered Brendan. Good actor, but nothing extraordinary. Then I've seen that standing ovation clip in some auditorium for his role in The Whale and I thought to myself \"It has to be some body positivity thing, right?\". I mean, how good can it be.By all means I'm not a connoisseur. I watch everything remotely good, sometimes in the background. But I'll watch a musical, cheesy rom com, avengers-type popcorn stuff, occassional drama. I stay away from niche stuff, because I want to be entertained, not research \"what author meant\" and how does it relate to his childhood or whatever. None of that pretencious stuff. But I do appreciate a good story, good acting, solid camera work, music, costumes and how the movie makes me feel in the end.Here comes \"The Whale\". And this movie is heavy. Really heavy. It has my heart racing, my palms sweating and I find myself sniffling like a little child and bawling my eyes out at the end. I don't remember any movie hitting me as hard as this one in a very long while. I could maybe compare it to the first time I've seen \"Requiem for a dream\" as a teenager. I remember sitting in my chair watching the credits rolling and not being able to move. Like it all didn't sink in just yet and I needed another moment. That movie wasn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. And years have passed, I've seen and experienced many hardships, so rarely anything moves me like it used to move me when I was young(er) and more innocent.\"The Whale\" didn't move me. It hit me like a brick to the face. I really can't say if it was Charlie's struggle, his kindness and how people took advatage, his loss, or anything in particular that resonated with me so much. The only thing I know for sure that Brendan Fraser delivered such a powerful performance it ripped the heart out of my chest.I underestimated you, Brendan. I'm sorry and thank you.",
  "Very deep superficial and multi layered at the same time": "Having known many morbidly obese people this movie invited me in. I didn't get what I was going for though. Honestly, I thought this movie was going for a connection between a man and his estranged daughter in a positive forward direction. In a way I guess I got that but at a very high cost.Another reviewer had an issue with overeating and obesity in general and I do understand, however like I mentioned, obesity is an issue and overall healthcare in general in the USA.This movie delves into the overarching issues in between trauma, excess, regret, self medication and un validated resentments.ALL IN UNDER A WEEKWhat would you do? How would you behave? Who would you reach out to? Or shy away from? If you knew it was ending?The cast is superb! The script is powerful. Knowing ONE obese person can give you the slightest hint of perspective. Brendan deserves ALL I'm of the accolades, and HONG too!Wonderful acting, beautiful storyNot something I will want to watch again, but having been changed because of viewing it.",
  "Amazing": "This film talks about a man with obesity problems. This peace of art is emotional and sad. Also the format of the film is in 4:3. The director did a fantastic job choosing this format. It makes you more in the skin of the primary personage which includes a claustrophobic atmosphere.The film maker makes an amazing job to make you stress and feel the emotion of the obese man named Charlie. This man didn't leave his appartement for a long time because of his condition. All the actors are amazing and implicated in their role. Even though this film is filled with sadness, Charlie is filled with positivity beyond his problems.Also, it can be hard to see him deteriorate and destroy himself. It can really make you think about life and the problems others have. The film is almost completely filmed in the apartment of this sick man. This full-length feature also talks about literature and has some interesting critic of the famous novel Mobby Dick. The main character is an English teacher who teaches college students online. He turns off is camera because he is ashamed of being fat. He is intellectual, demanding and passionate\nFor conclusion, I recommend going see this film with someone that is close to your family so you can experience their problem and see that yours may not be that bad compared to others. You should go see this film 100%.This film deserves an Oscar for the adapted screenplay award and all the cast should be nominated for acting. I give it 9.5/10.",
  "Finally a film about honesty!": "Let's just face it, we all run away from from who we are. We don't want to face ourselves. And maybe that isn't even our fault. It just has to do with the way we are brought up. Been told to be someone, to do something, but more frequently, to not be someone and to not do something, often not understanding that 'What we do is who we are' and not the other way around.This film is astoundingly resonant with my thoughts on being honest with oneself.The Whale is the journey of a man who is not what the society wants or wanted him to be. Likewise for most other characters in the story; the people are just so real.I feel like this script is exactly what the audience of 2023 needs, in a world full of 'who to be' ideas. The film is quite well written, though the idea deserves more cake than the pages themselves. While the flow is tight, some dialogues could be slightly more refined. I adore the undertone that an unhealthy relationship with food was given a psychological relevance, that is to cope up with a predicament. On a personal note as well, that is how it usually happens with myself. You feel stressed, and the first thing you want to do is either run away from food or eat too much of it, obesity inducing mostly.Darren Aronofsky, as always, nails the job. It is indeed tough for a director to set and play the entire story in a confined space, and yet reveal something new each time about the same. Subtle camera movements, dark color tone, and Aronofsky's archetypical eerie music all add to the character's ticking time bomb situation.An extra shoutout to the Sound Design and Music. Both of these elements put the audience in that anxiety inducing zone where 'any moment could be the last.'\nAlso a Brilliant play with inserts and set design.Fraser has done an electric job, from his eating mannerisms to his voice; everything is the character.I think we do need more films like these, focussing not on loud action sequences, but on the individual story and moral dilemmas of life and who we are.Definitely worth a watch in cinemas.",
  "This is one of the greatest": "It is not about the Oscars.This movie is simply one of the greatest out there. The direction is impecable, the perfarmances are marvelous, accordingly. The sincerety and its impact on the viewer is what it stays in the end as a valuable lesson.Brendan Fraser had a very difficult task and eventually, he mastered it. The rest of the cast did bring their best, which is more than enough for the story.Aronofsky deserves more acknowledgment for this great work of drama. It is quite odd that he hasn't got it yet.Lastly, the movie gives us an insight and an opportunity to think again about obesity, mental illness, depression, all of them connetcted with each other and a part of many lives nowadays.",
  "For people who liked Gilbert Grape": "People like different things. I have seen movies that the majority have loved and I've hated. And vice versa. I'm not belittling anyone's opinion. Each to their own.I watched the movie based on the amazing reviews. I wanted to see what the big deal was. I was not disappointed. I absolutely loved the movie. It was heartbreaking.My title refers to the movie \"what's eating Gilbert Grape\". And I honestly think that, if you enjoy this movie, you will enjoy Gilbert Grape and vice versa. Both movies are about \"journeys\". Except, they go \"nowhere\". Except, they both go everywhere.I will watch this movie again. I enjoy many movies. But there aren't too many that i choose to watch again.",
  "How to Squander a Great Performance in a Cinematic Failure": "The performance of Mr. Fraser as Charlie was masterful and deserving of an award with the other performances average at best. The special effects were first class. Beyond these 2 elements which were clear from the beginning there was no reason to sit through this grotesque portrait of the slow and ugly suicide of a human being. The reason is because I felt nothing for him or for his family. I did not detect a shred of anything in his character as revealed on the screen that prompted an emotional response other than disgust.I am totally perplexed as to why this pretentious film was made and ask the director and writer what were they trying to achieve other than provide the opportunity for Mr. Fraser to win an Oscar. On this point I suspect the worst and it concerns the possibility that this is some kind of weird effort to normalize ugly mediocrity in the extreme...in itself not such an unusual thing in today's distorted world where pursuit of excellence and nobility is openly discouraged.Let's consider some of the ludicrous themes perhaps intended as redemptive. Firstly, Charlie is an incognito online writing instructor whose greatest wisdom is to utter...you gotta write what you really feel ....big deal... there is nothing interesting about this man. Secondly, he is trying to reconnect with his daughter Ellie, promising her money all the while with a kind of absurd, smirking optimism, subjecting this young person to watching his disgusting protracted suicide. Had he instead offed himself quickly and efficiently leaving his family the money after writing a heartfelt apology, I just may have felt something for him. Thirdly, he struggles to move his body mass into the bedroom shrine of his gay relationship which destroyed his family... this along with with the white light deification at the end and the Contact like other worldly beach scene is sheer nonsense. Lastly, the annoying whale metaphor referencing Melville's great classical work of Moby Dick serves only as a contrast with the failed writing behind this film.The side plots in the film including the inexplicable behavior of his medical helper who for some time has been complicit in his suicide, the young man Thomas who achieves reconnection with his family in some perverse way due to Charlie's daughter pursuit of \"truth\"...and of course the poor suffering wife who at the end falls into his hulking mass....all of these including the ever present unnecessary gay sex intonations do nothing to remedy the central flaws of this film.If all of this is about the evils of shaming and how this man achieves a religious epiphany at the end, I suggest the real truth is that what he is and what he is doing is in fact largely disgusting and shameful and any hope of redemption for him can only come, if there is reincarnation, in the next life.At an early point in the film I wondered if suddenly Charlie will really see the light and at least try to live by getting serious medical attention as a first step.... he could still die at the end but with a last gasp of do the right thing. After all, there are actual cases where his amount of weight has been substantially reduced. Alas, such a truly redemptive plot is not in the mind of the writer. Instead, the torture continued with my increasing regret in coming to the theatre on a rainy night to watch this debacle.",
  "Beautiful, haunting and vile.": "Darren aronofskys most real yet most painful film to date. Brendan Frasers portrayal of this 600lb mammal is mesmerising to the eye, for both all the right reasons and the wrong ones too, you get incased in raw emotion and addiction, through this films spiral of ones character.I began the film with a distaste for our Lead character 'the whale' feeling no empathy towards his poor life decisions, but as the film continues you seem to find an uncertain common ground with his situation, as he's clearly is an intellectual person with some motive to do right in a life in which he's done nothing but wrong towards himself, his ex-wife and his daughter.The use of the 'Moby dick' poem is ingenious, giving us a insight towards his past and his present, letting us know what state the lead character is in, besides his physical one, we learn about his tragic past and poor decides in such a way that i couldn't help but feel empathy towards him by the end, feeling as though he doesn't want to be what he is, that he doesn't want to have done what he has, although you can't help feel this dreading feeling in which he feels. That it is too late for change.The use of the daughter is done masterfully, you truly do gain an understanding for why he is the way he is, throughout the film it becomes somewhat haunting as his state seems to be caused by addiction and trauma, which feeds in the use of the poem entailing this films narrative beautifully to make a well rounded narrative in an otherwise uncertain character.Not to mention this films harmonious score that excels the brilliance of the cinematography, which only compliments the script even more, making those hard scenes even harder to digest and those bitter sweet ones ever so much more bitter, leaving you with a constant lump in your throat, out of pity, out of sorrow and out of disgust.Yet the films unexpected display of optimism doesn't leave you with a undesired swell of anguish, the film leaves you feeling rather hopeful, and wanting to bite back down on the twisted brilliance and beauty of aronofskys craft.",
  "The best at what he does": "Darren Arronofsky can add another masterpiece to his film repertoire. Like almost all of his other movies, \"The Whale\" is incredibly depressing, dark, and hard to watch. It pulls on the strings of the human condition which we don't want to think or talk about... yet most of us think and talk about them every day. It's so difficult to watch, but completely engrossing at the same time. Arranged like a play, the whole film takes place in one room. We watch as a 600 pound man eats himself to death over the course of a week. Replace food with drugs or alcohol, and this movie could have been a completely accurate depiction of someone dying from gradual drug exhaustion. It's almost satirical. Fraser should win an Oscar. It's easily the best movie to come out in recent years.",
  "Brendan Fraser is here for the Oscar": "Astonishing performance from the whole cast, especially Brendan Fraser who gave me everything to feel his emotions. Sadness, anger, disappointment and finally happiness. Also an amazing performance from Sadie Sink who really made me hate her from the first two minutes and the I understood why is she like that. My favourite scene despite the ending one was the scene between Samantha Morton and Brendan, it aslo had every emotion you could possibly want to feel in a movie. If Brendan didn't get the oacar, I think that all of us should agree that sth really wrong is going on in the Oscars and it will be one of the Oscars that was... Yk.",
  "Life's Deepest Regrets": "Darren Aronofsky's \"The Whale\" is a profoundly moving, tragic, yet authentic look at a dying man's deepest regrets. The Whale's true-to-life reflection of family relationships, personal guilts, dreams, and their inherent affinity allows the film's continual setting in a cramped apartment to be worth its simplicity.\"The Whale\" focuses on Charlie's (Brendan Fraser) last week alive as a morbidly obese man dying from congestive heart failure. The film cleverly employs a 1.33:1 cinematic ratio that exposes Charlie's massive stature and size on the screen. With a profoundly resonating score, beautiful cinematography and atmospheric setting, \"The Whale\" is technically excellent.The film examines Charlie's last attempts to reconnect with his daughter Ellie played well by Sadie Sink, who has been absent for many years. The film excels in the thoroughly complex and authentic relationships between each character. Such relationships are full of anger and hate, yet used as a medium to demonstrate deep love between them.The Whale is about the lifelong remorses of a dying father and his aim to reconcile with those he has grown distant. Although able to go to the hospital to help his condition, Charlie desires his remaining money to go to his daughter's future.Honesty is a motif employed in \"The Whale\". Charlie's last fragment of his daughter is from an essay she wrote in year 8, which analyses \"Moby Dick\". He cherishes this essay as it is an honest and beautiful reflection of the novel. The film alludes to the convention of hiding behind mundanity to hide true feelings of sadness in the form of literature, but it also can transcend social media today. The appreciation of his daughter's honesty in her writings is a fragment of his daughter that he holds onto deeply.\"The Whale\" concentrates on Charlie's anguish that his oncoming death was the sole reason for reaching out to his lost family, an act that he could never do before and now is too late. Fraser's performance is tear-jerking and oscar worthy. Sink and Chau are profound supporting members who ensure the cohesion and ultimate authenticity of the relations of their story.",
  "This is movie is beautiful in his own particular way...": "This is a great movie. No questions about that. But there's a lot of people that'll probably be put off by its subject and the structure of the movie (the whole movie happens inside a very small and kinda ugly apartment).What I'm trying to say is: this movie isn't for everyone. It is slow, methodical and very raw. The movie presents pain in a very out there manner. Every characters shows their deep flaws, their demons and their pain. The movie demands introspection from the viewer and challenges your vulnerabilities.You have to go in with a very open mind. But if you can click with it, it's just such a beautiful movie in his very particular way. The ending in particular... Slow, surgical and powerful are words that came to mind. Is very open ended and depending of the way you watched the movie or the mood you were in, you can interpret so many things.If you actually enjoy the more \"artsy\" section of cinema, this is a must for 2023. I loved it.",
  "Such a beautiful movie": "The way each character fit together was like a painting.I love the perfection of this film. Everything fit together in an ideal way that was deeply resonant. Charlie reminded me of myself. So did Ellie.To watch him unflinchingly see the beauty in her expression was healing. It is inspiring as someone who would like to work helping others. I am reminded of the value of hearing people's honest words and allowing them to be heard even if they are hurtful.The story was well-weighted with each character serving a distinct role in Charlie's life. The nurse's character was especially interesting with her being somewhat of an enabler but in a nuanced way- protecting him from his own decisions (and it was his decisions that got him where he was)",
  "Wooden acting and boring story - I want my 2 hours back": "I was super excited about this film, as I believe Darren Aronofsky is one of the greatest directors of our time. Mother! Blew my mind - his best movie so far and certainly one of the greatest misunderstood and most divisive films of recent years.However, you could build an entire log cabin out of all the wooden dialogue in The Whale. I couldn't blame that only on the actors, there was some sloppy directing, and a screenplay too closely adapted from a stage play didn't help either.I'm not a Brenden Fraser fanboy - I had absolutely no opinion about him before seeing this movie. I've never seen any of his previous films, or at least if I have, I don't recall.Aronofsky likes to create uncomfortable situations in his movies, so the subject matter and the characters didn't concern me - I was ready for it. What bothered me, though, was at no time did I ever care about any of these characters. Ultimately, there was no character arc, no redemption. The dramatic music swelled, then the film just kinda ended.Disappointing would not be strong enough to describe this movie. If the director's intention was to create another polarizing film, he certainly has achieved that here. Reviews seems to be either 10/10 or 1/10, only in this case I've ended up on the 1/10 camp.I am flabbergasted by the 10/10 reviews though - did we all watch the same movie??",
  "THANKS BRANDON FRASOR": "Extraordinary film.Thanks Brendan FraserIf Brendan doesn't win the Oscar then cinema is a hypocrisy.The art of acting well is there ... this is pure and simple cinema and one of the most beautiful performances ever in hollywood.Dramatic story about the darker side of obesity that affects millions around the world, especially in the United States.Irony of fate brandon was away from theaters for losing his contract with hollywood because of his image because of his weight gain and he was away from the big screen for 7 years and then he has a memorable performance like this , I can not get tired of saying thank you Brendan Fraser and welcome to the big screen again.",
  "Brendan Fraser shines in 'The Whale": "The Whale is a touching and emotional film that showcases the powerful performance of Brendan Fraser. Fraser portrays the character of Charlie, a morbidly obese man who is grieving the loss of his partner and trying to reconnect with his estranged teenage daughter. Fraser's portrayal of Charlie is nothing short of remarkable, as he brings depth and authenticity to the character's struggles and pain.Fraser's performance in \"The Whale\" is undeniably one of the best of the year, making him an obvious candidate for the Best Actor award. He embodies Charlie's physical and emotional challenges with such conviction that it's hard not to be moved by his performance. The chemistry between Fraser and his co-star, Zosia Mamet, who plays Charlie's daughter, also deserves recognition for its authenticity and rawness.The movie's poignant storyline left me sobbing as it tackled themes of grief, loss, and family relationships. The film does an excellent job of balancing moments of levity with moments of heart-wrenching sadness, creating a rollercoaster of emotions that kept me engaged from start to finish.However, one issue I had with the film was its length. At times, the pacing felt slow, and the film could have been edited down to make it more concise. Nonetheless, the emotional impact of the story and the outstanding performances from the cast more than make up for this minor drawback.Overall, The Whale is a powerful and moving film that showcases Brendan Fraser's impressive talent and acting range. It's a must-watch for anyone who appreciates a well-crafted and emotionally resonant story.",
  "A true Masterpiece": "In every way you look at this drama , The Director made it like it is about to get tense But every Time Charlie will made things Right\nEvery and Every Time but The Last Time with her Dughter He Finally let every Thing Go Just to See Her in Flesh and For The First Time smile. And Don't Forget to Mention The first Time she Calls Him Daddy.Personally I Was Crying The whole Movie. Because The Movie was Very familiar in every way for Humanity.Charlie Believed In Humanity So Should We.I was Having doubts About Seeing This Movie because I heard It Does truly Affect You in every way but In This time We need Like These Affectal Movies.",
  "A journey through one of the most deepest yet common taboo in today's society": "What an emotional ride it has been to watch Darren Aronofsky latest masterpiece. He nerver fails to surprise us with the beauty of human connections yet contrasted to our innermost demons hidden inside ourselves. He has never been afraid to tackle taboo subject like drugs, abandonment or mental illness. Now with brio, he dives into the depths of obesity with great compassion and delves deeper than ever before into his character's mindset. You will fall in love of Brendan Fraser's performance. The one of a lifetime. How many times my heart was pounding hard with a unpredictable flow of emotions because everything you're watching on the screen is so raw and pure leaving you constantly on the edge. You become a family member also trapped in this situation, trying to understand our hero's journey.An intimate movie, a fable to life and death, to redemption, of brilliant kindness yet, to the hardest feeling a man can experience. A fight of love.A must watch for everyone to understand one of the most deepest yet common taboo in today's societyMy favorite of the year, no doubt.",
  "Honestly just amazing": "What can I say apart from the movie was amazing\nIt felt so personal, as though you were part of the story it was something close and personal to you, which involves emotion throughout.It was shot so well the acting was amazing and really struggled with some of the story as they were all real world problems,Never cried so much throughout the movie.Really was a tearjerker. I really hope Brandon gets all the recognition he deserves for this amazing part really was so emotionalMust see go and watch promise you won't be disappointed .Still thinking about the ending, I'm going to interpret in my own way.",
  "Review of the film Whale 2022 Directed by Darren Aranofsky.": "Crumpled and with a lot of grammatical and punctuation errors.I would like to start with a comparison with previous paintings\nA small remark: the opinion is subjective and is based more on an emotional response during viewing. Factors such as budget and scope of events are secondary.So. Taking into account the fact that the film receives the highest rating from me, namely 10 \\ 10 points, questions should be asked by type: the better this film is than the author's previous works and the more so the better it is +-1450 of the other films viewed with a lower rating. I will try to briefly justify such a high rating below.I'll start with something in common, namely the emotions that this movie caused while watching.Weeping.. lots of tears.. haahahha okay not much. There were 3 moments, 2 of which just made me cry, but the third... This is the final picture, its culmination. Digression: as far as I remember, the first words spoken in the film are the reading of a certain essay (about the author of which we learn only at the end) and the film ends with the same essay, only this time it is not the main character who reads it, but its author himself. It would be nice to draw some kind of parallel and analysis here. I want to write about the looping of the work ( this technique was used in the author 's last picture , but more directly or something ) is it more abstract here?! I've lost the essence of what I've written... Oh, yes, emotions! The finale of the picture shows the development of the character, the achievement of the final result. He becomes as happy as on the best (okay, not on the best day of his life. There is a gluing showing a moment of rest with his family when he was happy being with them before he decided to leave them. After his relationship after marriage, after a short communication with his daughter in the last week of his life, he finds happiness and is literally able to soar above the ground ( of course, these frames are an artistic technique and only part of the final scene, but even without them, the hero makes efforts and only at the end becomes capable of actions that he did not commit for a long period of time. How badly it's all written, well, as it is))) these are closed brackets and not closed brackets, like funny.Comparison with past works can still write?!Neither the Requiem for a dream, nor the Wrestler, nor the Black Swan, with all its advantages in the form of music by the actors of editing and locations, did not knock out so many emotions from me. The film Kit, though stingy on characters and locations (there is only 1 location in the film, not counting one flashback), but he wins with emotions and characters. Since they are related to each other and their interaction.To write more... Okay, this is not a review. I don't know how to write them, this is the second one in 19 years.In principle, everything that I wrote about comparing with the best works of the director is also suitable for other films. If the picture is capable of evoking strong emotions, this is an excellent picture that should be recommended to everyone. Whether it's comedy or horror (the simplest films in terms of emotions. If the comedy is funny, it's a good comedy, if the horrors are scary, it's a good horror movie. There's drama right there. A drama about people, and to be quite precise, a drama of one person and in a drama (well, again, to write that it is more difficult for a drama to evoke emotions is stupid. A clarification is needed: a feeling of fear or fun, as for me, is easier than sympathy and experience for a character who should cause disgust or something like that, therefore, since the film Whale (about which it can be read in the annotation) causes strong emotions with all its simplicity of the plot and unpleasant (at first glance) main thing hero = the movie is great\n( I lost the essence of the sentence, so the ending is so-so)\nI would like to end this text with a call to watch this movie. This is definitely the best film of 2022 (it's good that you don't have to choose between him and Pinocchio Guillermo del Toro, because the latter is a cartoon)\nTo watch strictly in the original with subtitles !!!It would be nice to reread what was written, but I'm afraid there will be a desire to erase everything, so let it be as it will be.",
  "This is a hard watch": "There is a lot of gratuitous violence in this film but not of the kind often seen on film. I am talking about violence towards the self. I was left unsure as to the film's centre of gravity - no pun intended. It is very claustrophobic as it's set in one room. It lacked confidence in its direction: whether it was a story about the challenges faced by an obese man or a man trying to reconnect with his estranged daughter. There were several scenes that showed the director lacked restraint. I walked out on one scene. Why was it made?what was the point of it? To shock? Well it did that. To highlight the challenges faced by obese. Ok, but there are channel 5 documentaries that do this better.",
  "Dramatic and Empatheticc": "This film is a formidable testimony of the loneliness that we all carry inside and in particular of the people who suffer from tragedies caused by letting ourselves be carried away by the passion that clouds our minds at certain moments in our lives, whether it is due to the death of a loved one , the distance from those we love, the betrayals, and the sadness of being different in a world that imposes the criteria of the majority.The performances are simply stupendous and should cause the recognition of the Academy. The drama perceived in a dense atmosphere of fatality that will trigger the most hidden emotions of the protagonists. I am very satisfied with the level of histrionics exhibited by Brendan Fraser, which brings tears to the most indifferent.With many high-quality artistic elements, THE WHALE will go down in film history as an outstanding effort in directing, visual effects, scripting, and most of all, acting.",
  "Simply great": "Rarely you see a movie where people stay in cinema after credits to just take a moment. Super acting, great and realistic storytelling and mood. That's what Darren does to you (except Noah :D).Brendan is magnificent and I still can't believe that lame Elvis actor got Golden globe next to him and Bill Nighy. Not that it matters much but it should still represent best achievement.Ty Simpkins and Hong Chau, such refreshment. Samantha Morton amazing as always. I would like to see her get more recognition in public. Sadie pointing her career in quality direction, being proper rebel. Even Sathya as Dan, the pizza guy, is awesome in that small but memorable role.",
  "Hard Watch but Deeply Moving": "The Whale is a very hard watch, but truly one of the best movies of the year.Like everyone else has said, Brendan Fraser is absolutely phenomenal and gives one of the most emotional and moving performance I have ever seen on screen. Brendan deserves every award and it's so nice to see him back!The rest of the cast was great as well and everyone carried a lot of complex emotion.Basically the entire movie takes place inside Charlie's apartment and there are only about 6 people in the entire cast.If you'd re looking to see a movie that will make you feel something and take you on an emotional roller coaster then this is the one!",
  "Stunning just stunning": "I don't recall ever watching a film that has gripped me so much. So beautiful held together with a stunning powerful back story.Fraser has been back on my radar since watching doom patrol but this movie has shot him back in my life.His acting for this movie is amazing just truly amazing which makes me think as over the years he has put some serious weight on so maybe he was able to reflect his own emotions into this.This is the kind of movie that I personally think only pops up every 10 years which at the moment I can't compare it to anything I've ever seen.Must mention Sadie aswell, another wonderful performance.You won't regret this one people ( you might crave a meatball sub with extra a cheese after watching this, I did!)",
  "A good drama film": "The film begins with an English language teacher who has problems communicating with his daughter after nine years. Our main character also has obesity, but our story revolves around Charlie who wants to reconnect with his teenage daughter after learning of his imminent death. This story is brief. I will begin by reviewing the film first. The acting performance in the film was one of the most wonderful things in the film, with the exception of Brendan Fraser, who was the strongest in acting. It brought me the feeling of loss and the feeling of difference in which he lives. Secondly, the drama was written in a beautiful way. I felt the drama between Charlie and his daughter, and how others feel about him that he is different because of his illness and his relationship with his ex-wife, who was very perfect. At the end of the review, the film was complete in all respects, written, acting and dramatic. The film deserves a 10/10 rating.",
  "Film that transmits a mixture of feelings.": "This film, which is a drama, covers topics such as obesity, its complications, obesity in an integral way, which not only has a genetic or nutritional component, but also the entire psychosocial component that influences its development and permanence, religion's influence on people's beliefs, on guilt and unmanaged grief and how this can affect multiple people (since we see how abandonment affected Ellie, and how these unmanaged situations led each character to present feelings of anger-anger-guilt that affects his day to day), he also talks about different types of addictions, eating disorders (which always have their biopsychosocial component), the persistence of prejudices against homosexuality, fatphobia. It is a film that it is impossible not to generate some kind of feeling in the viewer from the moment the film begins, sometimes it is difficult to watch because of all these feelings that they generate or even prejudices, like those seen in Charlie's class in which, out of shame, he never allowed his students to see him (however, you have to see the expressions that many had, as well as the pizza delivery man). Charlie prefers to die in a painful way, since it is his way of punishing himself for his \"mistakes\", especially with his daughter. Excellent performance by Brendan (who develops his entire performance in one room, in a house without leaving it, but generating endless feelings), Hong and a promising Sadie.",
  "Even the writer doesn't know the essay's ending!": "I didn't like this movie, I had higher expectations. It lacks power and drama and the ending is just stupid, even the writer doesn't know the last word of Ellie's essay, what a joke. There are many theories on the internet about this last word, no one will even know what it was, that's ridiculous. The acting is okay, but the plot is completely predictable, the young man in the church story is unnecessary and weak, Ellie's performance is overacted, and the movie is too long for what's happening in it. An hour long movie, this should have been. I saw it yesterday and I won't see it again, thanks for reading this.",
  "It was okay, but Brendan Fraser was incredible.": "I liked this movie, yet it felt unfinished at the end, as if there was more to the story. Obviously,\nthere were issues with the fat suit, but the performance felt genuine, as if it was coming from an actually obese person. I don't understand why this film gets so much hate, it was not that bad. But, to anyone who doesn't know what this film is, it is a sad, emotional tale\nabout Charlie, a 600-pound man with heart failure and potentially days left to live, who abandoned his wife and daughter to be with his gay lover. He then realises that his daughter is flunking out of school, so then tries to help and bond with her, knowing that she won't want to see him, but trying to know he did one thing right with his life.",
  "A window into the soul": "Well...this is a masterpiece in cinema with a leading performance that is moving and emotional.Fraser is completely believable as a morbidly obese man that has one thing he is proud of, but doesn't have in his life, his daughter.With his health declining he wants to reconnect in some way and reaches out, the story evolves over its 1hr 57min runtime at a mild pace, but still keeps the viewer engaged, intrigued and increasingly aware of the fate that awaits.Supporting actors are strong, adding to what feels like a very real story. The aspect ratio is the old 4:3 creating a more intimate feel, a window into the soul of Charlie.It's not perfect, it could squeeze you even harder emotionally, but chooses to ease off the gas a little - you are kind of relieved and grateful for that when the film ends though!Got to be an award winning performance by Fraser.",
  "I knew this movie was going to be incredible...": "But WOW, was I low balling my expectations going in! I honestly don't even have the words yet.. Except to say that Brendan Fraser delivered a performance that literally reached inside of me and changed me for the better. I read somewhere that he received a 6 min standing ovation at the (or one of the) premiers, and that \"the critics\" tore his performance AND HIM down, saying he didn't deserve that response. It should have been a 20 min standing ovation! No movie let alone ANY ONE actor has EVER brought me to tears on SO many diff levels! Esp not just from their performance! All 3 were amazing!",
  "Speechless .. the Brendan Fraser comeback we wanted.": "Literally minutes out of the cinema seeing this absolute masterpiece. I'm familiar with a few A24 movies but this was perfection. Bawled my eyes out at the sheer beauty of the script and acting from both Brendan and Sadie, to say there was a dry eye in the room would be an understatement. Perfect length and really showed the true rawness of Brendan's outstanding acting. The short and abrupt ending was sensational and tied everything together so beautifully. I wasn't too sure how this movie would go but it's bleak and beauty shine through, especially with such an incredible story. Tied together so well.",
  "The most raw and human movie for a long time": "With the seemingly creatively bankrupt content Hollywood and big studios have been spewing out over the years I was incredibly surprised to see a movie that actually made me feel anything.Based on a stage play The Whale is filmed almost entirely in an apartment over the course of a week. It's total cast of characters is 6 people.The plot is literally the most basic thing you can get. A dying man trying to reconnect with his angry 16/17 year old daughter. Interestingly while this is the main plot it doesn't smother the side stories. At it's core it's a story of redemption and there is no antagonist, no protagonist, no good, no bad. Just hurt people trying to feel less hurt.Fraser does an amazing job of Charlie. He manages to make him feel simultaneously repulsive and sympathetic. He goes from gorging on a meatball sub, slobbering and chomping to tearfully telling his daughter she's a wonderful person as she tells him to hurry up and die. It shows his difficulty doing simple things like getting up. His shame is particular apparent he teaches without a webcam, he has Dan the pizza boy leave pizza at the door and leaves cash in the mail box so he doesn't see him. His only friend and link to the outside world is Liz, a nurse who is his late boyfriends sister and his enabler.I wasn't too enthusiastic about Sadie Sink as Ellie, Charlie's estranged daughter but she nailed it. Sadie has the raw anger and hurt of an abandoned and humiliated girl nailed. She's chaotic and acid tongued doing what she can to try and make the person who hurt her feel the pain she felt.A lot of this movie can be translated into our own lives. One particular scene after Dan finally see's Charlie, Charlie suffers a terrible binge eating episode. It sent chills through my blood because I know the place he was in that dark empty void. Replace food with whatever your 'crutch' is: sex, drinking, cutting, gambling, shopping, whatever it is we've all been to that dark place, we've all gorged ourselves to try to stop the pain and we've suffered the consequences afterwards. In Charlie's case vomiting everything up.I've already mentioned that the film is shot almost entirely in one apartment to enthasise Charlie's isolation but it's also shot in almost entire gloom and rain except for the last scene which I have to give props because the contrast is very noticeable and I didn't appreciate by how much.All in all The Whale is a very human movie. It's not escapism as such but a homage to honesty, vulnerability, hurt, love and forgiveness. It gives us the chance to recognise these traits in ourselves and in a world where we seem to get less honest and less vulnerable behind our filters that is something worth remembering: We're all human and we all hurt.",
  "Superb": "I had high hopes and a lot of anticipation going into this film. Just a whiff of the buzz around Brendan Fraser's performance was all I needed to hear to make me want to see this.This film is, and I rarely use this word, beautiful to watch. Everyone in this film is more than pulling their weight in terms of acting.Brendan Fraser is truly incredible to watch, Sadie Sink build on her excellent work in Stranger Things and that's 2 films I've seen recently that Hong Chau has been great in (if you've not seen the menu what have you been doing).This film has got some of that Aronovsky quirkiness but the camera if firmly fixed on the raw performances by these actors and it's a must watch.",
  "Let down.": "A director i have a lot of time for, but this for me was a huge letdown. I stayed clear of reviews as much as possible before seeing this movie, and i guess this film is emotive to some degree and a movie you could watch in one frame of mind and enjoy/appreciate much more than the next?I am not put off by the \"fat suit\" complaints i have read since, but the whole thing just felt contrived and forced! I thought the acting across the board was too dramatic, and yes i understand the pain suffered by the daughter, the wife, the main protagonist, but i just felt like swimming in someone's wallowing self pity!What is the message of this film? Is it our disgurt at this huge, unhealthy, sweaty man -who with more understanding we come to appreciate? Maybe, i am missing something here, but thought this was all a bit crap, cheap and unexpectedly more shallow than it wants to appear.",
  "An Emotional heartfelt story of a man": "Here in this movie very nice and heartfelt acting done by Brendan Fraser and directed by stalwart Darren Aronofsky .It seems to be based on a play, Just from the movie screenplay it seems such a great story where it's bound to touch many people hearts.Without too much spoilers , we see in this movie an obese English teacher named Charlie trying to be a good father, partner, and lovely human being in his own way while dealing with his deteriorating health condition each passing day. He strives and keeps motivating and keeps a cheerful positivity about him about human values which he wishes to pass on his daughter , his students and his wife.It's a nice emotional movie which truly captures real life obese people health issue while also shining light on the brimming positivity that they can teach all of us.",
  "Beautiful": "This is the most heartfelt beautiful movie ! ...\nA perfect piece of cinema !!!!It's claustrophobic...yes its hard at times. .. you will cry ....... this is what makes this movie amazing ...honest/ fun/ heartbreaking It the best thing brendan frazer has ever done ...I cried and laughed so hard at the same time .. a father daughter story that will rip your heart out ... in a beautiful way... original and unpredictablePlease watch this movie ... its incrediblePlease forget reviews that say its a theatre production ! Or any negative reviews .. you need to see this movie !!!!! These people are just horrific movie nerds..",
  "Should be a 10": "This movie is great and will forever remain in my heart. I had doubts, but Brendan came through with flying colors. Acting was A+, a 10 in its own right. My only drawback was the aspect ratio of the film alone! Everybody films in Widescreen. Why was this filmed in 1980's technology? Did it save that much money? I would and will go see this again. I am a 6.5\" tall man at 250llbs and the ending had me in tears.I ratte reviews on my opinion, not what that garbage rotten tomatoes has to say. II want to see movies come back and ben great again and if it takes directors like this and not big cooperate so be it!!Loved it!!!",
  "Eyes glued to the screen": "Everyone said the performance was impeccable and that's exactly what I thought myself. I was absolutely captivated and I teared up more than a few timesEveryone also said that the story was badly written and had many offshoots that weren't fully fleshed out, part of me thinks that was the point. Fraisers characters overwhelming optimism helped him find perfection in the most simple seemingly imperfect things. He wanted honesty from his students in their essays and from his daughter in her writing and what we also got from every character intertwined in his story was their own personal honesty in the end, imperfect and messy as it was. Imperfect and messy is life, in our main characters life especially, but he didn't care as long as he did one very important thing right and that's what mattered to him.",
  "Crushing weight of self-hatred, faith and heart": "I went into this with minimal information - mildly curious about what the buzz was about with this film and with Fraser's performance.And what a tragic, beautiful film 'The Whale' turned out to be.The film itself is not an easy watch. It is depressing, emotionally tense and painful. Watching Charlie struggle with his addiction, being hurled abuse by his estranged daughter (although not without reason), his ailing body slowly trapping him and killing him - and his appearance treated by others with shock and disgust, it's tragic to witness what Charlie goes through in the one week of his life we see on film.The film wasn't perfect - although the cast did an amazing job, there were little moments of overacting that sometimes disrupted the film's pulse.But just for that last scene, I'd watch the film again.The raw emotion of the last scene - the music, the emotional and superb delivery by Fraser and Sink just blasts you into this state of being where you're just overcome by the vulnerabilities spilled out by the two characters in their shared moment of honesty.We can't save ourselves, or the people we love, but we'll always try.",
  "I have never experienced such a long and motionless period of silence after a movie!": "Our emotions were so absorbed throughout the film, that by the time the final scene played, we felt quite stunned and overwhelmed. Everyone in the theatre was literally frozen in their seats. Nobody even made a move to start getting up, until we were well into the ending credits!It is hard not to simultaneously feel both sympathy and empathy for each of the main character's captivating and compelling portrayals of their stories. You will feel disbelief over the intensity of varied feelings you will experience, as well as the depth of self-reflection within which you will engage.I have never experienced such a long and motionless period of silence after a movie!",
  "One Over Bloated Whale!": "Not bad but overrated...And as far as Brendan's performance was concerned it was all one dimensional...All he did was sit on his Butt for two hours and emoting sympathy.... If you're looking for sympathy you should look it up in the dictionary! A one trick pony this movie...And the daughter was a total mess..I hated her character. Some humor could have helped to moderate the tediumAs I was watching this movie I felt it was originally a theatrical piece...As I always stay for the credits I found out that I was right! The hype for the movie comes purely from the publicist doing his job.About enjoyable as having a root canal...",
  "A real take on life": "I saw this movie last night. Contrary to the opinion of some critics, I do not think there was any insult or demeaning of people who have obesity.The movie portrays Charlie's life and problems in a completely realistic and emotional way. Viewers can easily identify with the moments in Charlie's life.I must say that Mr. Fraser's acting was very natural and professional. I personally could not hold back my tears for Charlie in many scenes and I really saw some of the problems in my life in him.This is not a film you can watch many times, but it leaves its impact once you have seen it.In my opinion, the Oscar was deserved, I recommend this film to all who like realistic and emotional films.",
  "Great movie": "I should start by saying I really enjoy Aronofsky's films. He really is great and creating movies that make you think and piece together parts of the story with your imagination much like reading a book. This film was no different. Fraser absolutely crushed it as well as Chau. The performances were very real and emotional. I thought the movie would be about a gluttonous man but it was much more. Although you feel sorry for the main character, you see he doesn't feel sorry for himself and only cares about helping others especially his estranged daughter. As someone that has been disabled for the past 9 months, I definitely understood the struggle of performing even basic daily activities. Just when you think you know where the movie is going, it goes somewhere else. Once you think you know the new route the movie is taking, it again changes course. That in and of itself is it a great movie.",
  "Impactful but for the wrong reasons": "You can see that I gave the movie and 8/10. I actually REALLY enjoyed watching this film but it's for the wrong reasons. The acting (minus Sadie Sink aka the daughter) was absolutely amazing. Not that I don't think she can act but rather her character isn't developed enough to get over her awfulness. I wasn't big on the character in Stranger Things and it's pretty much the same thing here with more foul language. That said, Brendan Frazer was absolutely amazing. Deserves all the accolades he's been getting. I also think the Liz character was so well done as well as Thomas. This all suffers from bad writing unfortunately. With this level of acting and cast they could have hit a home run and possibly made one of the best films of all time but there were little things here and there that just sucked like why the heck is there a pizza guy (Thomas). It's like they wrote him in with all kinds of foreshadowing and then did nothing but look at 'the whale' and then run off. It could have easily been done without the setup like some salesman comes to the door. That said, there are some religious overtones but it doesn't get preachy and it doesn't force it down your throat. I think there's something to be said about that. I'm not religious and hate when people use the generic route of \"welp, it's god\" so it is refreshing to have sort of a weird take on that piece. Again, all of these people deserve any award they get.. From super hero movies to reboots of everything, it's nice to see something original and well acted. Bravo.",
  "Hard beautiful movie": "What a hard beautiful movie, difficult to watch by moment, a trully American movie as only in the USA do we have that type of controversial difficult relationship between religiousness, emotions and food, only in the USA do people eat their emotions to the point of killing themself. A sentence keeps coming up in the movie with the obsession of Cap. Achab and the whale Mooby Dick...and it is very close to what we do when watching this movie. All the actors are good but on!y in the USA would that behaviour would be believable...try to watch this movie if it was set in UK, Australia, NZ, Canada , never mind France ,Germany...maybe Iran, Russia or China yes.",
  "Great film": "Expertly directed, and very well acted, this film felt, however, somewhat restricted. I understand it was based on a play, but that doesn't mean that all possibilities to turn it into a movie with a wider scope should be rejected. It all takes place in one room, and it can be boring at times. Some plot holes, or limited information on characters or situations, but nothing too off-putting.The main character was played with great conviction and the story unfolded slowly but eloquently. I found the ending to be very strong and touching. All-in-all, not the director's stronger film, but a very good film with great moments.",
  "Go if you want to really be touched by a movie": "I left the theatre having been moved by this movie. Although limited to one apartment (except for the opening sequence), it draws you in. Five lives intersect in this apartment-sometimes not in a good way. One of the most prominent ideas that stuck out for me was the \"eating your feelings\" metaphor-it really rang true (being a big person myself). Charlie's character, while not upbeat, at times could see the funny side of life as he knew it; and was able to reminisce in a poignant scene with his ex-wife. The entwined story of Charlie and his friend Liz was enriched by her understanding of his life. Add to that a bitter Ellie, and the in denial Thomas, and it is a truly rich viewing experience.",
  "Bloated and Underwhelming": "Aronofsky is a curious director. The cumulative weight of his films has resulted in critical acclaim, but individually there is always something lacking to his work....maturity, a sense of place, groundedness...The pros? Fraser's performance is amazing, the cinematography is wonderful and the vast array of shots within the confines of the home are masterfully handled.The cons? Everything else. The characters are intensely unlikable because people are often unlikable (\"let's all go and see the realistic film about realistic people\") but their wild swings into comedy and surrealism is poorly handled, jarring and unrealistic. The portrayal of trauma is condescending and simplistic (\"there's a scene of an overweight person crying and eating so the film must be trauma informed amiright?\") and the ending? Wildly uninformed and inconsistent with the trauma porn that the flick had been portraying.All in all, The Whale is not without its merits, overrated, immature and messy as it is.",
  "A must see! Brendan Fraser offers a moving and Oscar-worthy performance!!!": "Like many others, I was curious to see what Darren Aronofsky, director of Black Swan and Requiem for a Dream, was up to, particularly with a revived Brendan Fraser.I'd want to thank every single actor that appeared in this film. Whilst I'm sure some acting experts will find fault with each of them, I feel they all put their hearts and souls into playing these characters, people who are all totally justified in their respective views. Considering the film's origins as a stage play, the film tries everything it can to maintain the tale intact without feeling the need to display everything, which is rare to find in our current culture where everything is seen rather than told. My curiosity was peaked when I learnt that the film was centred on the problems of an obese man and was shot almost entirely in the main character's apartment, with only 5 people. The idea that a film of this calibre could garner so much attention in an era where CGI and high-quality special effects reign supreme should persuade everyone to see it.Brendan Fraser offers a moving and Oscar-worthy performance as a bereaved, chronically sick man nearing the end of his life.",
  "How did Darren Aronofsky do it?": "When I heard that The Whale received stellar reviews and standing ovations once it began to premiere at different film festivals, like many others my attention was quickly drawn into being curious about what Black Swan and Requiem for a Dream creator Darren Aronofsky was doing, especially with a revived Brendan Fraser.My curiosity grew even stronger when I heard the premises of the film, that it was a story surrounding the hardships of a morbidly obese man, almost entirely filmed in the main characters apartment, with only 5 characters. The idea that such a film could absorb so much attention in an age of cinema where CGI and high-quality special effects reign supreme should enthral anybody to consider watching this film.Darren Aronofsky has taken a play by Samuel D. Hunter and turned it into a cinema masterpiece. We see Brendan Fraser in a raw form, portraying a character, unlike anything we have really seen on our cinema screens. From the opening scene, the viewer is hooked. They can't overly enjoy what they are watching, yet they cannot look away. You are engrossed by what many of us deem to be gross, yet we eagerly watch and wonder what is about to happen next for Fraser.Through his own unique engagements with each other character he comes in contact with, who all give us spectacular performances, Brendan Fraser has been given the opportunity to provide us with a performance of a lifetime in this emotionally volatile spectacle.",
  "Brandon Fraser was compelling. The directing was not dignifying": "The performances were phenomenal. No doubt. It made us love the character.But you shouldn't have to make the direction/framing about how difficult it is to live in that body. Those focused shots and conversations were incredibly undignifying. Just like you don't need to love someone for being a good person, despite being black (sarcasm). You shouldn't have to be this compelling perfect character of a person to love a fat person despite making everything else about them in the direction very undignifying.Thankful for the amazing acting. That's why I give it an 8. The fatphobia a could've stayed away. Maybe that's what we focused on during the book/play's era.",
  "A beautiful yet distressing story of a man in pain": "Brendan Fraser knocks out out of the park as Charlie, a depressed, self inflicting hermit, who's only two cares in life are his daughter, and sincere honest writingHong Chau is phenomenal as Liz, Charlie's carer and friend who only wants to help and free Charlie of his demons.Aronofsky does an incredible job of portraying the emotions of Charlie, especially with his use of colours regarding weather and the transparency with light and dark between scenes (trying to avoid spoilers)I haven't felt as emotional while watching a film since UP and would recommend this film to everyone. It's beautiful, yet harrowing, but so real and raw it will leave you thinking about it for days.",
  "Life goes on. Watch to reflect on your life.": "If you are the one who enjoys walking in the park, seeing the sunset, talking to yourself, and thinking about what life goes on, This movie suits you.When death comes, we all have concerns about what to do with the remaining time. We, spectators, are not taken along to discover what the characters will do next in this film. Instead, \"The Whale\" challenges us to examine the reasons in the depths of their souls for why they decided to do that at this time...Really pleased to see Brendan Fraser, from The Mummy trilogy, and Sadie sink, from Stranger Things, show what the real acting look like.",
  "you can't be at charlie's side.": "The movie was good. It's drama. The whole thing to me, it stays at a 5/10. We all make mistakes, and maybe that's what the movie is trying to say but there are mistakes and MISTAKES. Every relationship and every end of it has its karma, we all deserve redemption in life and forgiveness, but there are times that some mistakes knock on the door of karma. I couldn't understand Charlie til the end of the movie. He got what he got coming in his life. I'm sorry. You can't move on to another relationship without getting a closure in the relationship that you were before. I don't care if you have fallen in love, you have to say goodbye to your last lover. If you don't, you can't pretend you're not gonna have karma as soon as your new relationship fails. And if your last relationship came with a daughter, you NEED to put an end to that relationship, if you want to start a new one. Charlie didn't, It's selfish and narcissistic. Typical men behaviour. You can cry and play the victim now when you were seeing another person and being unloyal to your lover with another person... you had a daughter... say goodbye to that lover, then start a new relationship. I am sorry, but Karma is big. Redemption is fine if you keep your head up high, and learn the lesson.",
  "Like an onion: so many layers and brings a tear to your eye": "Apparently, Brendan Fraser talked to morbidly obese people when researching this role. And he does a fantastic job. This movie is about love-hate relationships. Not with each person, with the person and themselves. For example, Charlie hates being fat, but loves food which makes him fat. His friend Liz hates the church for what it did to her brother, but loves Charlie for being the ultimate reason for the church hurting her brother. This is evident in each character and makes for a fascinating study of human emotions. Yea, yea, yea. But the story, though, the story? It moves through the characters and keeps you in the edge of your seat without frustrating you waiting for answers and resolutions. You live in each moment with the characters. Their stories are so intricate that you want to dwell on each one, chew it slowly, and enjoy the feeling. Like eating the best chocolate you've ever hate. (However, Fraser's 100 pound prosthetics suit definitely inspires one to put down the nachos.) The script is from a play and you can see that which is disappointing because a movie should bring more if a cinematic experience. The story has to stay in one physical place in the play, but here they could've included seeing the characters in their own environments. That's minor, though. At the end of the movie, the entire audience just sat there for several minutes. We couldn't move. We didn't know if we should be happy or sad at the ending. But it doesn't matter. If you like analysing the characters, peeling back the layers, looking for the double meanings in every single thing, this should be on your list of things to do, immediately. Fraser definitely deserves an Oscar, even if he doesn't win. 10/10 for entertainment value. 10/10 for the acting. 10/10 for the story.",
  "Best Actor but I need more of Charlie....": "This is an amazing character study all set in Charlie's home, with only a handful of a cast (except for the students seen on the laptop who go uncredited). This works perfectly as Charlie's interactions are only with: his estranged teenage daughter, his carer/friend (who has a major connection that explains her relationship with Charlie) and the delivery guy, who visits the front door so often, without actually meeting Charlie f2f, he becomes concerned and tries to slowly befriend him, through maybe curiosity or concern. The story plays out subtly and slowly with a pace that allows you to feel and empathise with all of the characters who interact with Charlie. They themselves have their moments and issues, but it is Charlie you really feel for as you begin to see inside his life and his mind, his regret and despair, his pain and ultimate despondence whilst also wishing to fulfil his wish to reconnect with Ellie and let her know how important she and the essay written by her 8 year old self is to him and finally him being able to be at peace. I would have really liked some flashbacks or some insight into his life with Ellie and her Mom, and the transition from that life to his life with Alan, and how Alan made the decision to end it. The background to Charlie's life would maybe make a great prequel to this beautiful yet uncomfortable movie which brought tears to me at the end. Wonderful performance from Brendan. But I feel there could be more to Charlie's story that I'd love to see.",
  "Brendan Fraser's best comeback?": "Well,this movie is so emotional, having the impressive performance of a phrase that impacts and touches your soul, seeing charlie's life makes us realize how an overweight person would not be having a good time, it is a simply heartbreaking and wonderful story.And on the other hand, Sadie sink takes her role as the daughter very seriously, wow, it must be said that I don't even think of her character as Max, she catches you with the emotions she presents on screen, I hope this film can offer an Oscar or another award to Brendan Fraser, the return to the cinema in this film is fascinating........",
  "Heartwrenching": "Brendan is perfect in this role! Being an A24 film, it is rather artsy, but quite enjoyable! It is a deeply sad movie, and Fraser gives a remarkable performance. It caused me to tear up a few times. I liked that it wasn't predictable, and I wasn't sure what I was getting into from the start. Fraser really makes you sympathize with the character and feel frustrated on his behalf for the way he is treated and the position he is in. As the plot unfolds, the reasons for his actions begin to make more sense, and it is beautifully sad. It makes you just want to give the character a big bear hug! His pain feels so real, and I'm sure people who have struggled with parenting and/or morbid obesity/health problems can relate. All the actors did a really good job in their roles!The only thing I'm taking off a star for is that I didn't like the way the ending was presented as open, but that's typical artsy/A24 films for you.",
  "Unforgettable viewing experience": "Darren Aronofsky has a brilliant eye for humanity. This is the first time I enjoy being in the theater watching one of his movies, I was too young when Black Swan and Requiem for a Dream came out to see them in the big screen but nevertheless those two movies have been in my favorite since I first saw them.\"Noe\" and \"Mother!\" were the first experiences I had of finally being old enough to see a Darren Aronofsky's film on the big screen but nothing like today, today I went to see \"The Whale\" and it is a beautiful movie.Breaks my heart how real this movie feels, and it inspires me how many people this movie can touch and possibly help them get back on their feet.This movie hits different if we know the actor, Brendan Fraser, struggled with difficulties prior to doing this role, realism is brought to this film in a unique way and my empathy for this human left me with tears. Perfect told story and even better execution, it really shows how much caring was put into making this piece of art.",
  "Decent, but the self-obsession is so deafening it's a turn off.": "TLDR: Fraser and Frost deliver a visceral performance masterfully directed by Aronofsky, but the movie main theme (morbid obesity) is overshadowed by a self-pitying scriptwriter who SHOUTS at the viewer about his struggles as a gay man in an homophobic world of yesteryear.Any release by Aronofsky is something to look forward to. And the hype that accompanied the film gave me dizzying expectations.Instead of a grandiose follow up to \"requiem\", we get a very intimate, adaption of a self-obsessed play by Samuel D Hunter (the play is semi auto-biographical).The scriptwriter doesn't just tell us about his troubles about being accepted as a gay man, he SHOUTS then at us. And it has nothing to do with obesity or the challenges of raising children, with both arcs ending up as 'excuses' to bring up 'the impossible love story' over and over and over and over again.Aronofsky clever use of mathematical references echoing 'Pi', biblical allegories and even the 4:3 format do not allow it to break the confines of a script that's teasing the viewer with great promise but no actual delivery.The 'litterally' arc was promising, a kauffmanesque approach to raw emotion put on paper. But sadly, the main arc is weak at best and the support cast performances with a Sadie Frost at her very best.What a waste of talent and effort.",
  "I left the cinema sobbing like a little child, speechless!!!": "One of the best movies I've ever seen. I'm rooting for Brendan Fraser to win an Oscar Award this year coz he deserved all the credits. I'm always been a Brendan Fraser fan and this movie was his best. Very well acted by all the cast members. Every scene of it is just magnetic and you don't want to blink an eye for the fear that you might miss every important details of the film. I suppose to attend a party after work today but I chose to go to the cinema to watch this film and I'm so happy that I made a great choice. All the people in the cinema are in tears to watch the final scenes. Bravo!!!",
  "Loved": "Very moving..true to life story. Well acted and will leave you in tears. My hope is that people learn not to give up on life and cherish your kids. I found it relatable even though I had nothing in common with the characters except for thier emotional trauma and need to connect. The teenager was portrayed accurately and tge parents devastating in thier missed opportunities. I say watch it for Brandon but learn from the pain and sadness.The only disturbing message was the pressures of Christianity...to me it was the parents fault on how they treated their son not God's fault. Jesus loves us no matter what. Be honest be hopeful and love one another..don't throw your life a way.",
  "Incredible acting": "Brendan Fraser will win Oscar 2023.It was very hard not to cry during several scenes.Branden Fraser is simply amazing. Under direction of Aronofsky it's probably the best dramatic film of the year.Fraser portrays the role to perfection. You feel sorrow for his character. The lady from Stranger Things that plays his daughter he is trying to reconnect with is going to be a huge star.There is nothing unlikable about this film. Fraser tugs at your heart strings with the struggles his character goes through.It's almost hard to watch at certain points in film; I had to take several breaks it's very emotional.",
  "Astonishing performance": "-We can just keep focusing on Charlie's magnificent facial expressions enough to feel the suffering he lives between his social relationships disturbance and more over for disabilities he is having from obesity..\nBrendan Fraser rolled an epic scenes, Every breath, move, cough, look and expressing pain were so real and touching.Actually on personal level I suffer obesity and could feel every detail of Charlie's life.-Also there is a great lesson to learn about parents endless love to their children and their high willing to sacrifice their life for their kids, Even if they were separate and living apart for decades.",
  "Fantastic": "I like many Aranovsky films since the Rekviem. The Whale is an anthem on sensitivity behind wild things, an anthem on forgiveness and an anthem on the roots of fatherhood. To my opinion such films are missing from our global cinema. Millions are spent on rich films that lack on emotions. It is a surprise that this film is not a nominee film for best film. I am happy at least because the protagonist is. It is 9 and not 10 as to my opinion with about 10 minutes less the emotional volume would be higher. I also waiting a link berween obesity and repressed emotions. I am sad as some film critics are strict towards this film. Ok sometimes we imagine some different things would be better but this kind of cinema is often absent from the end of the 90s and after from world cinema. Let's honor it and let it breathe again.",
  "The end is so brutal it left me crying speechless": "So, the film story is not complex and it is portrayed in a nice pace, not to slow not to fast. Characters are well developed ando there are some interesting and mind provoking subjects like trauma and food obsession. But what stands out to me is first Brandon Fraser's AMAZING performance and than some dialogues and scenes where there are 2 people involved. Him with his daughtet, wife and friend. It is so emotional! And the director and sound editing are just amazing. How the climax is build with the music is beautiful! Piece of art! Loved it! And oh my god. The end is so strong! Its a punch on the stomach. I never watched a movie that ends that way! Left me crying and speechless. I had to breath and absorve it all. Just great!",
  "Solid central performance in a play masquerading as a film": "In my book, filming a play and calling it a film doesn't work. Film obeys different rules ro theatre and the successful transitions such as Virginia Woolf, 12 Angry Men and Streetcar all have one thing in common. They were all made for cinema, adding intimacy and closeness that theatre cannot give.The Whale is a play filmed as a play and apart from the central performance is acted out by the cast as a play. Melodramatic lines that may well work on stage are delivered here without any nuance or understanding and the camera emphasises it all as phony as it blows it all up a zillion fold. Reaching out to a crowd from a stage distance is not the same as cinema where every expression is underlined and picked up.There is also very little effort in characterisation from all the players here and though a few things are alluded to, some things don't add up. If Ellie is such a one note hater, I struggle that all of a sudden we have soft moments without warning only to revert to the one behaviour we seem to get. The mother is unbearable and very over the top acting doesn't help. Even the few tears seem fake, rolling silently as is now the fashion of any movie or series. There is a sentiment of fakeness for a film that talks so much about 'honesty' all the time.I also think that Charlie's destruction could have been with anything else (gambling, alcohol, etc) and that we are shown what we already know as part of an obese person perspective far too many times in an effort to add gravitas and/or titillating revulsion.The conclusion, when it finally comes, ain't nothing that was a surprise and in a story that could have been so much better further weakens the movie adding a sort of Hollywood relative 'happy ending' that is simply not ringing true.I did not dislike it and I certainly did not like it either. It did not move me and I was glad when it's 2 hour screen time was finally up. As a piece of cinema it stands pretty worthless to me and I am guessing that in a few years time it will join the rank of those worthwhile movies everyone talked about for a while but no one remembers like Children Of A Lesser God...",
  "This Film Definitely Moved Me": "I got to see The Whale yesterday and I personally thought it was great. I felt like it was much less nihilistic than some of his other films. I love Aronofsky and has appreciated every bleak film he has made, but I felt like this one was much more hopeful. That's just my opinion, I know plenty of other people feel the opposite. I know that this film is meant to be a sappy drama but it worked for me, by the last scene I was drenched in tears lol. I went into the plot of this film pretty much blind and I'm so glad I did. I had seen some of the hype and was excited, but I was not going to go into this film with rose colored glasses. Noah was the last Aronofsky film that I saw in theaters. I have seen all of his feature length films and it was the only one that I just hated. So if it would have missed the mark it would have sucked. But it didn't at all in my opinion. I thought that the black of an advertising campaign was great. I highly recommend the Whale to anyone who wants to watch a slow burning, intense drama that deals with themes such as regret, shame, guilt, bad health, or anything similar to those topics.",
  "Truly heartwarming from Mr Fraser": "This movie will tug at the heartstrings of most people who watch this. I could feel my emotion building up all the way through the movie until the scene when Charlie (Brendan Fraser) let all his emotion flow and the acting in that scene was absolutely top class. Now I remember when brendan sort of burst onto the scene in the movie california man and to say this movie has now shown us how good an actor he actually is. Now the movie is about a man who teaches classes online that left his wife and kid (Sadie sink) for one of his male members of one of his classes which wasn't done online. He fell for his pupil and left his family but his partner commits suicide leaving Charlie behind who Now wants to reconnect with his Now 16 year old daughter as he has grown obese with his loss and is dying. So the story takes through the last week of his life and him trying to connect with his daughter as he knows he was in love with his partner but also feels he had let his family at the time down. I felt so so emotional during the movie as you could see how much of a decent human being Charlie was and the regrets he has in life catch up with him at the end. Potential movie of 2023 and fraser is well deserved for his Oscar nomination for best performance from a male lead in a movie. He will be up there with some of the best performances so far for that nomination.",
  "Love it": "A24 has done it again, it takes our hearts in this amazing journey of emotions and makes us feel the empathy with a man who is going to the beginning of his end so beautifully, the performance is so nicely done that you immerse in this tale as you were there. The story of love in so many ways, as love with your one true love and as with your daughter and a friendship, the exposition is quite a low requirement because all the material is needed in one place, I personally love how everything is developed in a room and all the drama is within, people come and go in this little room, I recommend to take this journey with patience and let it feel you as it will make you feel all the emotions that they provide us.",
  "Good movie, bad character.": "The movie is good but also messed up.It keeps you at the edge of the seat for the whole time even though the whole movie takes place in a single scenario.But I didn't feel any empathy for the main character what prevented me from feeling the whole drama that other people felt. The main character relationships are broken and people around him are brought down by his irresponsibilities.He could have had a new relationship with the guy and still be a good father\nIf his wife didn't want him to see his daughter he should have fought for her in justice/ court.He should pay a fair share for his friend going for groceries all the time.He should have a housekeeper.He shouldn't assume that providing money for his daughter would fix the years he wasn't there for her.He shouldn't have died in front of his daughter traumatizing her for her whole life.The movie is messed up.",
  "Worthy of Arthur Miller": "By the end of the film I had nothing too offer but tears and an utter silence. Its not enough to say this film is a masterpiece. Fraser's performance is nothing less than perfect. The way he poored his heart into this character was evident, and executed with the upmost care and beauty. I only wish that more films today had actors such as him. The theatrical blocking and practical lighting effects made me feel as though I were on a stage with the actors. Truly, this was a movie experience I will never forget.Moreover, it was a film that reminds its audience to seek out truth, and to live in that truth, despite any and all consequences. And the value of connection with one another. Human to human.",
  "Brendan is an amazing person": "From the beginning, my life and his life are the same, however, the problems for me and Charlie are different. Charlie (aka Brendan Fraser) wanted to die so do I. Charlie has eaten many junk food, so Liz, Ellie (his daughter), and Mary (his wife) said that he needs to go to the hospital, but he refuses and he has a lot of money ($120.000).His daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink) is cruel to Charlie because he left when she was 8 years old. Although, Charlie offers to give his money and teach Ellie about the essay.The point is Charlie is a marvelous person. He encourages Ellie. I think he should do exercises, eat healthy foods, and go to the hospital because his mindset is positive for others people except himself.",
  "Just awful": "Melodramatic and boring. Brendan Fraseer is decent but nothing awards worthy. The Plot and writing was horrendous. Nothing redeeming about this film. Sadie Sink was also very bad in her short role. The worst part about this film is that it insists that it has something worth saying which it does not. The films \"message\" is disgustingly simple and naive. If you have a choice of watching this film and a nazi propaganda film I would suggest the latter. Nothing in this film is awards worthy and is possibly the worst film of the year. A depressingly mediocre slob of a film. Fatphobic and awfully acted.",
  "A journey of unhealthy grief. Brenden's tearful comeback.": "The film harshly depicts grief and unhealthy coping mechanisms in authenticity. A more grounded and dramatized version of the original play. A lot of issues regarding religious beliefs, homophobia, estranged family relationships are addressed through the medium of Charlie. So often we get consumed by our grief, we neglect the effect it has on everyone else and often realize it too late. The film depicts this perfectly.Darren Aronofsky's direction is in a stage play format making you feel like you are in the scene with the characters. Very often it can be a hit or miss. But was a hit for me. He is a fearless veteran of film making. I have loved him since Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain.Brendan Fraser delivers brilliance. His heart wrenching performance stands out the most. His depiction of grief and helplessness is deeply relatable and you empathize him the most.Sadie Sink's character would have been easily despised and superficial, had she not delivered on the complexity of her conflicting emotions. An amazing portrayal of a daughter abandoned, yet having love and forgiveness deep within her for her dying father. An upcoming A+ actress of her generation.Hong Chau's subtle performance of a caretaker, her own grief, guilt and how that ties into her relationship with Charlie is beautiful. I have never scene her acting before but would sure watch out from now on.The last scene where Charlie walks towards his daughter, in his eyes finally doing something right, left me in tears.One of my favourites of all time. Brenden deserves his oscar.",
  "An Oscar worthy performance by Brendan Fraser!": "Brendan Fraser's stunning performance made me speechless and I cried too at the end. It is a beautiful film and every person who was a part of this film has done their best. The story is a normal one but the message it gives to the world is promising. I personally loved everything about this movie and I hope that it is up to the expectation of viewers. The director and the entire crew have done a tremendous job and the mixing of religious essence to it is also a plus point as per my knowledge and gave a perfect impact on the storyline and the film. I hope and pray that Brendan Fraser will win the Oscar for his incredible performance!",
  "Heart breaking, left me not okay.": "I can tell this is a movie I will be thinking about for months to come. Everyone is the movie is flawed. So if you're the kind of person who only likes movies where there is a hero and a villain, this isn't for you. Everyone is much more complicated than that. The movie is made in such a way that I believe it is up to you to interpret the characters the way you want. Everyone is the movie does pretty much the exact opposite of what they should be doing because they think it's what's best for everyone.We do have to make some assumptions. Not everything is explained and outright said. You have to make inferences based on the dialogue and use context clues to understand each character's motivations. Charlie due to various life circumstances believed he was alone and that no one cared for so, so long. But when he started getting sick it was clear that his family, friend, heck even the pizza guy and his students cared about him and we're concerned.I think this movie is about so many different things. But mostly it's about how living our lives as authentically and as honestly as possible is the only important and worth while thing we can do. It's also about how human beings cannot help but care about others no matter how hard they might try not to. It's about how loving and caring about other can sometimes make us act in selfish and enabling ways.It's a beautiful movie that left me stunned and speechless. What I love about it is that you can interpret the characters and the ending in multiple ways. I think this is the kind of movie who's meaning changes a bit with each viewing as you pick up of different details here and there. I would recommend this movie to anyone who struggles with depression, anxiety, binge eating or just feeling isolated from the world and alone.",
  "Once a generation there is a movie......": "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf (1966), Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) and now The Whale (2022). This was drama as it is meant to be done. I was an emotional wreck at the end of this movie. Brendan Foster was truly amazing and I am shocked he did not walk away with a Golden Globe. He deserves the Oscar for this acting triumph.The Whale hits all the emotions - laughter, sadness, disgust, anger and, finally, overwhelming grief. Like others who have watched this, at the end I was a blubbering mess (and still am as I write this review).This is a movie that will stay with me for years and I do not know of I will have the emotional fortitude to see it again but it is a 'tour de force' for Brendan Foster. As others have also written, this might well be the best acting I have ever seen.",
  "Symbolism at its finest": "Movies that rely on symbolism have a tendency to become so intellectual that you lose that bare emotional connection with the characters that is needed to make you feel. But not The WhaleChoosing extreme obesity as a manifestation of our demons, you can start immediately connecting with the main character as a person separate from you, one that you might even be inclined to pity, but little by little, you realize that the whale could be any of us, with any of our peculiar self-destructive behaviors and mindsets.On the surface. The Whale might look like a movie about obesity, but the stigma of obesity is just a vehicle to portray the general features of social seclusion in the modern world, to emphasize the clarity of mind and soul that is needed to choose that one thing which is dear to us, and to celebrate the courage that it takes to stand up for it despite and spend our lives for it.",
  "Brilliant, painful and just the one flaw": "We sat and cried in the cinema. Flawless depiction of love, loss, homophobia, poverty, mental illness and religious intolerance. Superb cinema.But then hold on..... The wife forgives the man who left her with a child and ruined her life because he \"fell in love\". He didn't give her the money he squirrelled away. The sister of his partner gives up her life to nurse the man who reacted to loss by eating himself to death. Oh and the young man who stole and lied is saved by the daughter, who benefits nothing and is misunderstood and hates by her mother. So all the women give and suffer and save all the men.Of course that's reductivist and there is complexity and much sensitive layering in this film of human frailty. But it did dawn on me that the women get a raw deal.",
  "Should I have watched this film ?": "The Whale 2022, \"Should I have watched this film?\" the question is something I ask myself on the occasions when I've sat through a film unworthy of my time or money. Sometimes I watch a film because its a genre I like, \"westerns\" or \"war movies\" or an actor who I find interesting because movies that they are in are invariably decent. The same rules apply for directors and even film composers , actually I'd watch a terrible film just for the film score (Ennio Morricone's scored some stinkers).I have even been known to be swayed by some reviews. I know of a film buff who watches religiously films reviewed by Mark Kermode, in turn he does a Kermode and invariably writes a pretentious review in the vain attempt of getting a recognition from his hero Kermode.. any way on reading of the reviews on IMDB I followed the critics advice which I will quote in full to reference my reason for not watching this film.\"I'm by no means unemotional when it comes to watching films. I've cried buckets at loads of films recently, from Mrs Harris goes to Paris (yes, honest), to Till (no surprise there) and back to The Last Bus. But I cry when I'm moved. I cry when I'm angry. I cry when I'm happy. I don't cry when I feel I've been manipulated to cry\"so thanks to Michael Kerrigan who ever he maybe I decided not to watch this film.",
  "Aronofsky, Always amazing": "SO often these days, I feel that people don't know how to give reviews without spoilers.. -_-\nDarren Aronofsky hits on a deeper level. He's intense, without the fastidiousness of Burton. His work reflects growth, openness, but also a persistent and fluid obsession with Meaning that I deeply appreciate....as an aside, I'm not at a great point in life right now, but I will Always connect with intent, with depth, with meaning, in life.I was on the fence for a while about whether or not to watch this film, seeing the poster image crop up online, but not looking into it much more - today, knowing this was Aronofsky and that it would fit my mood and elevate me to a better place (in whatever way), I let the movie and mood take me.If you're not sure you want to connect to an entire film based on 'mood,' fair; go listen to violin, and/or Yann Tiersenn, you may get a taste for a similar sense of yearning. If you're not sure what I mean about Aronofsky's films, watch them. I will say that this one shows a divergence toward and more direct interest in character development/relationships, in a sort of 'slice of life' way, than previous films.",
  "A movie that has a potential to save lives": "I really appreciate movies that has an impact for human's life. That can really push our buttons and remind us what is really important in our very limited time and we shouldn't take granted all the little things.The movie used very clear tools, metaphores, contrasts. It was really hard to watch sometimes.And I felt it after the end. That impact. How important is to be honest with yourself, embrace your flaws and mistakes in the past and forgive yourself while trying to improve.It is not a flawless movie but the intented message is received. I felt Brendan Fraser very authentic for the role and I think he really used his past to make everyone remember this movie.",
  "Brendan Fraser is phenomenal.": "I'm not particularly into slow or talky movies which this definitely is but that's not a bad thing. It was not a bad movie, one of the best I've seen in fact, just not my thing. Brendan Fraser is phenomenal. He blew me away. The supporting cast are just as amazing and there were moments I did really forget they were acting. Like I said, slow or talky movies aren't really my cup of tea so there were moments where I was a little bored as I have a very short attention span. The only reason I didn't give this movie a 9/10 was for that reason. My brother (who I saw this with) absolutely loved it. He didn't stop talking about it all the way home. This sort of movie is his favourite and he thought it was amazing. I would definitely give this movie a watch if it's your thing or even if it's not. I actually did enjoy it but like I said there were moments that felt really prolonged however the movie still really held up and I left the cinema still completely invested in it.",
  "Meticulously Emotional and Hard to Watch in the Best Way Possible": "This film is simply well written, filmed, performed and edited. For those that still don't know, this movie follows a very complicated stage of an obese man's life, in which he shows the viewer how his life is not sustainable as is, and gives you hope that he will change for the better.It is up to the viewer to decide, through the progress of the movie, if the actions of this man are redeemable or not. One thing is certain, if could be hate or love, but you will feel very touched by this movie no matter what you feel for this man.This movie also contains a religious aspect. Although not subtle, this aspect of the movie is controversial and will also allow for your own interpretation as the ending approaches.Highly recommend!",
  "A Sea of Emotions: Aronofsky's \"The Whale\"": "I'm not a professional film critic, but I'm a great enthusiast of the seventh art and would like to share my impressions about the movie \"The Whale\", adapted from the theatrical play by Samuel D. Hunter. Directed by Darren Aronofsky, this film is a visually intense and reflective work that makes us question the meaning of life from the perspective of an enclosed character. Like a good \"chef\", Aronofsky constructs a complex and unusual narrative that offers the viewer the possibility to \"appreciate\" the film rather than simply \"devouring\" it.With the help of a \"heavyweight\" actor, Brendan Fraser, Aronofsky creates a stunning cinematic work that makes us reflect on universal issues of the human condition, such as the excesses and denial that we often commit in our society. Fraser surprises with a warm and expressive performance that manages to convey many emotions without the need for words.Some scenes may be a bit intense and uncomfortable, but that's what makes the film so realistic and exciting. Ultimately, \"The Whale\" is a feast for cinema lovers, a complete menu with different flavors that together form a harmonious and enriching whole, the \"umami\" (as the experts would say). Aronofsky manages to create a cinematographic work of art that deserves a thunderous round of \"flippers\" (applause).",
  "A movie that shows how an easy solution becomes an unbulding problem": "The Whale is a movie that I went in with many expectations, many of which where very high, and that were certainly met. And I think the best way to start is by looking at the narrative and some of the symbolic gestures that you can see in them. So let's start with the good ones:One of course is the aspect of shame. \"The Whale\" portrays shame in a way that is somewhat unique. The protagonist, played by Brendan Frazier, is a character that is ashamed of himself. It is a shame that probably everyone of us knows- the loathing of the self and the own body. But, of course, taken to an extreme. As Charlies character is morbily, borderline disgustingly obese, the point of connection between the viewer and the protagonist shrink. I would say that most of us begin to distance our own sense of shame for what WE are with the shame that Charlie feels. Because most people have problems with their social lives, with their bodies, with their loved ones and their sexual lives probably as well. But not in the sense of being so obese that even the easiest things become a literal obsticle.And oh, there are many obsticles that we as a viewer didn't even think of and that contribute to the shame. Charlie cannot stand up. Not in any way- not for himself, not physically, not even against his own daughter to whom he has a very distanced and unpersonal relationship with. Things that fall on the floor become unreachable to him, because of his obivous problems (first and foremost being the metonymical \"whale\" in the story) getting the best of him.The Whale mixes the emoitons of shame perfectly with the emotion of disgust. Disgust comes in form of looking at a man refusing to get help- an easy answer to a huge problem- being overweight. It's actually the crux of every issue that the character Charlie has- he suffers from strokes, heart attacks etc. These are the obvious causes of his extremely incontrollable livestyle.But- as with the key that fell to the floor- the easy solution becomes unreachable and thus frustrating and disgusting to look at. Disgusting as in that we SEE how Charlie copes with his emotional issues- mainly his family issues with his extremely disgustingly behaving daughter. The coping mechanism (food) is what drives the movie. But there is more to it.The last aspect is, as mentioned, the daughter. Here is what makes the movie so great. Her actions are, truly and whole-heartedly, the ones that ARE disgusting. Not the.binge eating and gorging of Frazier, but the little and/or obvious intollerable acts of the daughter, who abuses the unconditional love of her father, is the thing that we should feel ashamed and disgusted about.So where does the movie leave us? Again: the \"easy\" things in live become unreachable. The easy things for so many, as having a more or less ok relationship with our loved ones, having more or less bodies that we can \"work\" and live with and the relationship with the aspect of mortility become a burden for Charlie.And thus, Charlie deteriorates before our eyes. And we cannot help but see, and feel helpless, ashamed and appalled. Disgust comes in many ways and in many shapes and sizes.",
  "A ComeBack of Fraser": "In Short Good but Predictable ( read full for getting complete idea)T's been almost twelve years since I was Darren Aronofskys Black Swan saw in the cinema - exactly on the 31st. December 2010. Something I should never do again, because the film still occupied me all night into the new year. But this experience had paid off like no other, before that I really had no comparable mood when visiting the cinema ( it was a preliminary premiere in Berlin before Black Swan on the 20th. January 2011 officially launched in German cinemas ). In recent years, this cinematic trip with Natalie Portman's acting performance, which is still unforgettable, has hardly been able to offer any other psychological drama to the water -, not Darren Aronofsky's last two filmsAbout Darren Aronofsky's latest directorial work The Whale was not too well known before today's world premiere in Venice and only two central information got through to me in advance: First, it is a film adaptation of the celebrated, Broadway of the same name - Plays written by Samuel D. Hunter ( of whom I had never heard of ). Secondly, so far there was only a portrait photo of the rather overweight Brendan Fraser (The mummy- Triloge ) penetrated to me. This worried me more, when for almost all other competitive films, significantly more eddies are held in advance, mostly with a first trailer.I am all the more pleased that The Whale the biggest surprise of the festival so far is and not only left me emotionally overwhelmed. Like back then Black Swan, the minimalist, theatrical drama caught me and everyone around me with a flood of feelings that I have had difficulty expressing since last night. The atmosphere in the cinema was extremely impressive, long after the end credits began. The undeniable star of the evening even got a round of special applause to show his name.Darren Aronofsky has taken on a physical topic again. It is about the English teacher Charlie ( Brendan Fraser ), who only offers anonymously online writing courses because he suffers from a pathological overweightness. When his days are numbered, he tries his 17-year-old daughter Ellie (Stranger Things-Star Sadie Sink ), who has not been part of his life for eight years now. When he left his wife ( Samantha Morton ) for his new love, she also completely broke off the contact between father and daughter. ( from here the lag starts, but can be avoided depending up on your mood)Darren Aronofsky himself is said to have said that he was concerned with people who are struggling with obesity and are therefore often condemned and rejected, to give a stage for your outer and inner world. So Hunter's play came just right. And it almost sounds a little too humble, because The Whale is fortunately so much more than just a film about the everyday life of a obese, makes you think so many times and releases your audience with a multifaceted redemption, that moves to tears.",
  "I Want To Talk About The Whale": "It's very rare that a film is able to pierce deep inside of me and bring out emotions I'd forgotten I had. The Whale is simply a work of art. It's not perfect by any means. There are portions that are very slow and mundane, there are many grotesque scenes, and ultimately if you can't handle depression and mental health disorder then this movie is probably not for you. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for one reason and one reason alone.....IT WAS REAL.I didn't feel like I was watching a Hollywood movie with actors pretending to be regular people. I felt like I was just a fly on the wall of man suffering from tremendous guilt, anxiety, and depression. Things like this happen everyday to each of us. We all struggle with issues that we are ashamed of and don't want to the world to know about. We all have things in our life that we have done wrong that has left us full of regret just like Charlie. And if you cannot find one thing in this film that you can relate to then I question your existence as a human on this planet.The life of Charlie is a life that very few would want to live. He was morbidly obese and in consistent pain day in and day out. He had chronic medical conditions and could barely even stand up on his own. He lost his partner to self deletion. And worse of all he had a daughter that he had not seen in 9 years who hated and despised him. But despite all of that Charlie did have one thing that we all have, Charlie had a heart.While his physical heart was on it's final stages his real heart, or rather who he was still shined through. Charlie was authentic because he knew he was wrong and he knew he messed up....big time. He chose to be romantically involved with one of his students over his own family. This makes Charlie unredeemable in the eyes of many, and rightfully so. How dare he leave his wife and 8 year old daughter to be with some young hot fling, who is the same sex as him by the way?The amount of hurt that Charlie cause not only his wife, but most importantly his daughter is immense. His daughter clearly loved him for who he was. She didn't hate him when she was 8 and he was around. She didn't wish for him to die when they spent time together as a family. It's only when he abandoned his responsibilities as a husband and a father that she developed a deep resentment for him. No matter how much money Charlie saved, or sent, no amount of money could replace him actually being there and present in his child's life. Any kid who grew up with one parent, or as an orphan, will tell you that. Money doesn't replace time spent together.And Charlie recognized this. That is what made him special. Charlie was deeply conflicted because he let his flesh pull him away from his family, which he knew was not right. However, he still did not want to completely abdicate his will to ensure that his daughter had what she needed. Once Charlie's partner died Charlie then began to sink slowly into the depths. Yet, before he let go from this world he decided the last thing he would do is try to reach out to his daughter one final time and see if he can reform a bond, or rekindle any kind of love that had been lost between them.Ellie being rude, abrasive, arrogant, and blunt initially wanted nothing to do with Charlie. And could you blame her? She put him away from her mind a long time ago. For nine years she had no father to help her, guide her, and be there for her. Why should she all of a sudden be open to hearing from him now just because his life is coming to an end? Why should she allow him to try and right his wrongs with her now that he is dying when he had years to do that before, yet he chose to be with his partner, Alan, instead?This is where the beauty of the whale comes in to play. In my opinion this movie gracefully incorporates Christianity (which is heavily discussed in the film) into it's entire premise because what is The Whale ultimately about? It's about forgiveness. Charlie realizes that he is a fallen soul and that he has not done right by his ex wife, his friend who cares for him, and most important his daughter, Ellie. He knows this to be true. Yet, all Charlie can do in the span of a week is simply, in his own way, ask Ellie to forgive him. She longed for a father and he was no where to be found. This lead her to turn into the troubled teen that she was, but Ellie was NOT a bad person.Just because she was rude and abrasive does not make her a bad person. Her mother even thought she was evil, but Charlie could see through her. Ellie had a good heart, but she was just heart broken that her father left her and her mom. It made her feel like she wasn't good enough for him. And although it took some unorthodox methods of convincing Ellie to forgive him, despite everything she'd been through she eventually opened up her heart and forgave her father for his iniquities. That's what makes The Whale beautiful. Ellie does not owe this forgiveness to her father. She is well within her right to walk away and never speak to him again. She would not be wrong to let him die in his misery. But she doesn't do this.She realizes that even though her dad made horrid life choices and is a big bag of mistakes he still loves her and cares about her. He did check up on her and got what little information he could about her through his ex-wife. And Ellie realizes this in time. She sees how much Charlie loved her review of Moby Dick and how he cherished what she had written. She saw that he truly thought the world of her and she was more than good enough for him as a daughter. She decided to re-open her heart to him in his final moments and when she called him Daddy it was then in his final stage that he new she had forgiven him and that she does love him. And although his life was over, he was able to be at peace and atone to Ellie for his sins. This is what makes The Whale beautiful.",
  "Truth about live": ".\nThis film is very painful. The main idea is simply to be nice to others: the main character struggles with not accepting his appearance by others. That's why he doesn't accept himself. All he thinks about is how to end his life in the most destructive way. The other side of the film deals with the relationship between father and daughter: because the Whale does not accept himself, he has no relationship with his only child. He doesn't think he deserves her love. He sees how his daughter has become an intelligent, fearless and beautiful young lady. She saw him as a father who always loved her.",
  "A heartbreaking story": "This movie was heartbreaking. It's about love and loss. The pain and angst of all the characters made me cry. Something that is very hard for me to do. Throughout the movie, the characters eventually showed who they really were, behind the mask that everyone wears. It also showed how love really is, beyond the flowers and hearts. The deep gut feelings that are what is truly love.Some would say the ending is a happy ending, while others might believe it to be sad. For me, it was both happy and sad. This is one of the most heart wrenching movies I have seen in a while. I highly recommend watching it, with a box of tissues.",
  "Mesmerising": "I watch hundreds of films each year but I very rarely write a review on IMDB because, by the time I rate something, many people have already given their 'opinion' plus I think I'm a notorious low scorer because ratings of 9 or 10 should only be given to the best of the best.However, occasionally, you watch something so good, so emotional, so heartbreaking and so deserving that silence just doesn't do it justice.There are enough 'opinions' already written about the story and the central character so you don't need me to add a further one, other than to say this is the finest film I have watched for many years with an absolutely powerhouse performance from Brendan Fraser, in a film that will define his career, plus a small but excellent supporting cast.When I get to the end of a film and I can barely see the credits because of the tears then I know I've watched something very special.Quite simply, The Whale is magnificent.",
  "Awsome!!": "These lines are my most sincere thoughts about the movie, maybe many of you don't agree with me but maybe the vast majority do. This is one of the best movies I've seen recently, for the bunch of bad movies that have come out lately, this one stands out by far. Some tears were shed at the end of the film by the audience, including me, and the ending couldn't have been better. I honestly do not understand how this tape is not nominated for best picture and we can see others for instans Avatar, in this Oscar categorie. Go and see this film, it will be the best you can do at last for the last months.",
  "Adding Perspective": "Powerful and emotional film. The acting is superb, particularly from Brandon Frazier who delivers a raw and moving performance. The story is poignant and thought-provoking, exploring themes of redemption and the human condition. The film's pacing is well-done, building tension and emotion in a way that keeps the audience engaged throughout. Overall, \"The Whale\" is a must-watch for fans of indie dramas, it's a film that will leave a lasting impact on viewers long after the credits have rolled. The movie is a powerful reminder of the importance of second chances and the possibility of redemption.",
  "Stranded, beached.": "Everyone keeps stating \"career best\" performance for Brendan Fraser... That's not really a high watermark now is it?It's a good performance, but in the grand scheme of films this year, Cate Blanchett in Tar is far superior - Fraser's \"alright\" by comparison. As someone that's worked with mental illness, (eating disorders not my speciality) I felt the film really glossed over the complexities that the character should have embodied.As someone who was raised on the horror genre (something Aaronofsky's touched upon historically), I felt like I could see the joins in the fat suit and whilst Fraser's more/less convincing, I didn't feel his physicality was. Maybe I would have believed John Goodman?What I felt was maybe, the strongest part of the film, that genuinely surprised me and I'm beating around the bush here, but... I came away from this, kind of despising obese people. Like the christian character - they do it to themselves and others enable them and frankly both Fraser and the christian child in it really filled me with revulsion. I'll generally cry at most \"emotional\" films, but for some reason this really \"triggered\" me and I can't put it down to any personal experience either. Maybe it was \"too hyped\", to much pre-press, but 10 minutes in and I'm annoyed at Fraser, then the enabling nurse/helper/rag on a stick wielder - that's probably what annoyed me the most, seeing a medical or \"caring\" professional taking such a dreadful and destructive part in this man's life - she's more like Ahab than anyone else in the film, both at least fall under the \"gross misconduct\" banner and if that's the best metaphor the film summons from me, I'll call it a failure.Disappointing.",
  "After the movie popcorn was still there.": "I just saw the movie. As I was watching I caught myself stopping from eating. This happened not because I was full but because I had a human in front of me that he was trying to commit suicide.It was incredible. I never thought that kind of a plot. He was trying to commit suicide by eating. As the movie goes I saw him die with a very slow and difficult death trying to redeem himself for the things that he got wrong. He have his odyssey inside his own house that every little thing it become a challenge for him. Lastly even before his death he try to inspire his students and everyone around him. Sorry for my English I wish that you found my review helpful.",
  "You'll Cry. You'll Laugh. You'll Fall in Love with Brandon Fraser Again.": "Saw The Whale yesterday and am still shaken to my CORE over Brandon Fraser's once-in-a-lifetime performance. This movie has a few themes you could probably predict will be unraveled solely based on reading the movie's description or watching its trailer. Humanity. Religion. Grief. All lie, raw, like Charlie and his brood, from start to finish. This one isn't an easy watch, by no means. Definitely bring a box of tissues and get ready to ugly cry with strangers (the magic of the theater!). The coloring, the score, the weather, the apartment, Brendan's character, Charlie, all are deeply depressing with only subtle cracks of light peeking through and those - in my opinion - have the most tear-jerking reactions of all. Try to avoid the deep reviews before you watch as they'll probably force you to experience the movie differently. The only thing I'll let you know ahead of time is that this is remastered from a play of the same name so the whole knock-at-the-door and the \"who's there?!\" trope is a bit overdone and is hard to appreciate offstage but still worth a watch despite that. Final Verdict: Brandon needs an Oscar for this role (Sorry, George of the Jungle). The movie? A little too much sensationalizing of obesity and not enough beefiness in the plot but Aronofsky provides something undoubtedly worth watching.",
  "Hard to watch": "I found this movie hard to watch,not because it was bad because it wasn't in fact it was brilliant, being a person who has always been heavy,(not as big as the main character) it brought up feelings that those of us who are not of a light nature will understand. The taunts,the name calling,being told to look in the mirror and being made to feel like you are less than you are,It helps to portray that weight is not just a case of \"eat less,move more\" a phrase that i have personally heard too many times but in fact that eating is connected to the emotional state of the mind also. Part of the movie shocked me as we don't really think of someone that weighs that much as having thoughts of a sexual nature the same as anyone else but well. Why wouldn't they? It's normal. I was also struck by how much our appearance can be judged, I mean when you are just a voice people tend to listen to you without prejudice but when they get the full picture, your words don't seem to have the same impact. There are not many movies that can keep your attention for the whole movie with only a handful of characters, but the acting from Brendan Fraser and indeed all the characters was so good and so pure,it is hard not to get engrossed in the storyline even though as i said it does at times make you feel uneasy. This movies deserves every award that is coming to it and hopefully it will make some people think about how they treat others.",
  "Brought tears to my eyes": "I am 42, and I have seen so many movies through out my life. But I never came here to IMDB and made a rating before. This is the very first time. The movie is a master piece. Very few characters but their impact is huge and meaningful. Brendan Fraser is amazing, in fact every one is amazing. I have never seen such a performance before. I know him since from The Mummy, always enjoys as an action hero, but this just an another level. Hope he gets the Oscar. Knowing the end and still they manage the plot the story in an excellent way. Darren Aronofsky did it again. Congrats to the whole team. Wish you luck.",
  "This movie came out at the perfect time...": "This was the most incredible movie I have watched in recent memory. I am not usually a crier, especially at the hands of movies, but I was a basket case for the last hour-sobbing uncontrollably during the last 10 minutes. Mental health is such a huge issue in our society, especially after Covid and its impact on social isolation. Add in a tumultuous father-daughter relationship and morbid obesity, this film tugged on every one of my heartstrings, even though I am not obese, a mother, or dealing with severe depression. Aronofsky and Fraser hit the ball out of the park with this. If Fraser doesn't win best actor, I will be shocked.",
  "Amazing film.": "This movie was amazing! It touched me in such a personal way. Everyone's acting was nice but Brendan Fraser was spectacular! Simpkins performance was pretty good too!It's a refreshing point of view, it shows us how deep and beautiful can be the love of a father for his child. He didn't want to continue living in this world, but he wanted to make sure that his daughter was well. Although I would have liked it better if he had fought to improve his health to live with his loved ones, but we have to be realistic. A man who has been in that condition for so many years is deeply depressed and has no desire to go on.I also thought it was an exceptional detail when Charlie tells his daughter that he was in love and that it was not her fault. It show us how parents are human beings too, capable of doing mistakes but giving so much love.The film from beginning to end was impressive and beautiful.",
  "Disgusting": "I was hesitant to watch this movie to begin with but I did and I so regret it. First off, the begging of the movie showed a gay sex scene with two men having sex in the shower and Brandon F. Jacking off to it. That was the first red flag for me. Secondly, some random guy comes in trying to preach to Brandon and honestly I didn't like how the Bible was misinterpreted throughout the movie. As a Christian, I'm not perfect but some of the Bible verses I thought was wrongfully used in the movie-It just didn't sit right with me. Lastly, having to watch a fat person shove food in his mouth was stomach upsetting for me. I mean I literally could not eat after watching this movie, definitely spoiled my appetite. Great actors but terrible nasty film. I would have liked to see Brandon F. Make a comeback in another movie with a more masculine character. In my opinion the movie script was disturbing and awful. I wouldn't recommend this movie or watch it again! Yuck.",
  "Outstanding movie": "Tremendous performance by Brandon Fraser shot in a particularly great format for the type of movie, excellent supporting actors a plot that really touches the heart.The whale delves into the human factor, loneliness, frustration and the desire to amend past events.With this brendan Fraser comeback I think his performance should win this year's Oscar.In a movie that takes place in a room, the plot moves quickly and has an extremely moving ending.The movie The Whale takes us on a roller coaster of emotions ending in a climax that we already know is going to happen but in a great way.Once again director Darren Aronofsky hits a home run.\u00b2",
  "A simply amazing lead performance": "This is simply a spellbinding lead performance from Brendan Fraser - The story takes you on a journey of loss, fear, loathing and hopelessness - On a whirlwind of emotion in 2 hours, which seemed like it was only half an hour long - You sympathise with every emotion of Charlie's character, and experience every inch too, as the story goes on - if Brendan Fraser doesn't win an Oscar for his performance it will be a travesty, simply put - It will drag you in and wish you are never part of this type of story... which quite frankly is what Hollywood wants you to want to be yearning for, in a strange way.... Which is exactly what Charlie wouldn't want..... Overall - Fantastic film - Best Actor MUST be won.",
  "The Whale: An Honest Review": "I heard about the controversy surrounding the film and I have read many of the polarized reactions around it. Before we get into the narrative, it needs to be said: Charlie is not \"fat.\" He is a bariatric patient. This isn't mocking someone for being a few pounds overweight, this is a human being suffering from a serious medical condition. The film portrays this suffering honestly. If someone feels \"disgust\" with this film, it says more of their predisposition than what's on screen.This story is not about being fat. This could just as well of been someone drinking themselves to death or taking hard narcotics.The Whale isn't asking us to be disgusted by it's characters or even to pity them. It is honest. Brutally so. Aronofsky is trying to get you to feel with them, not for them. To try to truly empathize not just sympathize.This a powerfully empathetic study of how someone can devastate and eventually destroy themselves trying to fill the hole inside. The hole left by loss and grief that all of the players in The Whale (Fraser, Chau and Sink especially) portray so beautifully, painfully and honestly.Brandan Fraser's Charlie loses his family and his job. A choice he made, true, but an honest choice done not out of selfishness but out of love. Then he loses him too.Sadie Sink lost her father. She acts out angrily and spitefully at the world trying to get someone, Anyone to acknowledge her. Someone that will acknowledge her pain and her loneliness. She's lost in plain sight and the people in her life don't truly see her until she reconnects with her father.Ty Simpkins and Samantha Morton give understated but strong performances of lonely, suffering characters in their own rights. Simpkins is losing his faith and desperately clinging on to it. He is hoping and praying for a miracle, a purpose, a higher calling; for something, anything to have meaning. Morton has lost her husband and lost connection with her only child. She fills this with the more cinematically traditonal (and critically palatable) flaw of alcoholism. If this was like most films, Charlie wouldn't be a bariatric patient. He would more likely be an alcoholic or a drug addict. Maybe that would be less controversial or polarizing.Hong Chau (in yet another strong performance from her) has lost the only true family she has. As an adopted child she doesn't know her biological parents and she despises her adoptive parents for reasons laid out in the film. Her adoptive brother is gone and she is now losing his lover, her last connection to him, in front of her eyes. How she fills that hole is by caring for others. Disassociating from her own needs so that she doesn't have to feel that pain. I personally empathize with Chau the most. I'm a medic and have dealt with many bariatric patients. It is difficult for me at the moment to think of anything more personally painful than trying to save someone and watch them fade away.Charlie isn't \"fat.\" This is not a fat shaming film. The reviewers who claim that the film \"leeringly treats Charlie as an unsightly object of pity throughout\"\u00b9 and is \"fatphobic\"\u00b9 are speaking of their own discomfort more than the quality of the film itself. The Whale is also not saying that \"the abused should love and forgive their abusers,\"\u00b2 as some other critics have stated. It merely proposes that we see them as human.Aronofsky has never been a terribly empathetic filmmaker before. What he has always been brilliant at is his study with obsession. Obsession with order (Pi 1998) with fame (The Wrestler 2008) with perfection (Black Swan 2010.) This is a welcome emotional shift for him as an artist. While his previous work looked at the choices we make for oursleves out of obsession and (let's be honest) a certain degree of selfishness, The Whale explores the ramifications of those choices. It shows the deep guilt and shame that can come from that for us along with the accompanying pain and hurt inflicted on those our decisions affect, whether intentional or not.I don't believe \"that the film's empathy was only superficial\" or \"reinforced anti-fat stereotypes and preconceptions.\"\u00b3 This film to me, more than anything else, felt honest. The Whale shows all of its characters to be flawed. However none of them are evil or disgusting. They are human.\u00b9Mark Hanson, Slant Magazine\n\u00b2Katie Rife, Polygon\n\u00b3Roxanne Gay, The New York Times.",
  "One of the best movies I have ever seen.": "I just finished this movie and had to write a review. This is my first movie review on this website. This movie has solidified itself as one of the best movies I have ever seen. I was hooked from the first minute and the movie brought me to tears. Everything about this movie was utterly wonderful yet tragic. The movie in my opinion was perfect. Brendan Fraser was outstanding in this role and is one of his best movies yet. He acting was perfect and impeccable. I am a huge fan of the Mummy movies, but nothing will ever pass his role in this. It was a masterpiece and one of the few movies I will recommend to anyone.",
  "The whale drowned in a sea of vanity": "While Charlie's pain is transmitted to the audience proficiently, his daily mishaps are nothing but boring chapters\ndescribing the monochrome life of a whale, to distract the audience from the real problem; the absurd.Charlie made the neurotic decision to \"do one good thing in his life\", that good thing being dedicating the earnings of his lifes work\ntowards the future of his daughter, whatever the cost.But the cost, was made up and ludicrous. Refusing to save himself was superficially and act of shame.Underneath that surface, it was an act of immaturity and denial to regain the responisibility of being a father, for the\nsecond time in his life.Charlie had enough money, support and reasons to escape his dystopian universe, and restore his relationships with the people around him.Instead, he made the rather \"uncoscious\" decision to abadnon everyone, as life did not give him what he wanted.This is not a movie about pain or misery.This is a movie about parenting and the creation of artificial struggle.",
  "Poignant, Thought Provoking & Beautiful": "The movie started by highlighting what a viewer would expect in the life of an overweight lonely guy. And goes on unwrapping the complexities of the main characters' psyche and the reasons behind his size and how his life spiralled. The movie shows a genuinely positive and very kind man in a very dark and depressing life. The people around him are negative while he remains upbeat and being the small positive light in a dim and dreary life. He tries to reconnect with his teenage daughter to save her from herself whilst being on the brink of death himself. He truly sees her for the person she is and tells her she's perfect and beautiful. His final moments he manages to save her before departing from the world and going to heaven where he sees her again as a young child before the credits roll.It hit me so hard having only just lost my own father to heart failure just two months ago and being so close to him. I walked out the movie looking awful after having sat through the entire screening ugly crying.Utterly beautiful, poignant and thought provoking. I would really recommend it. Just maybe not if you have just lost your own father to heart failure recently like me lol.",
  "Point and less.": "Seeing Fraser back on screen was good, but I didn't particularly like the way they brought him back. There was no point to this movie, no awe inspiring ending, it was void of meaning.There where jarring moments for me that brought me back to Austin Powers, or even the end credits of Dodgeball (fu Chuck Norris).By the end of this movie, I only felt dislike for Fraser's character. He was the embodiment of the worst of mankind, the apex of selfishness. How could anyone care for him on any level?The daughter was way over the top, the character was over acted, and nonsensical. The whole plot thread with her and the bible salesman was an ugly add on.I would've liked the movie to end with Fraser's character alone and showing that he was the villian in this story. A very selfish human who only cared about himself, getting exactly what he deserved.Aronofsky's The Fountain was a much better experience.",
  "Most powerful movie I've seen in years!": "There are movies with great acting, and others with great stories, this one has both. A powerful story that will move you. Faith, love, and the pursuit of happiness are all factored in. The viewer will feel the angst of pain, love and sadness from each character. Focused on a new storyline for Hollywood, morbid obesity is not a genetic condition, but a byproduct of heartbreak and tragedy. Fraser's performance is off the charts, as well as those by co-stars. Oscar worthy in multiple categories. Best Actor, Best supporting actress, Best screenplay, Best Director and throw in one for best Costume/makeup.",
  "A complex and compelling film if you'll allow it to be": "I just saw this movie with my Dad and we both loved it. It's a movie whereby you're still trying to puzzle everything out hours after. I've looked at certain reviews whereby they called brendan and his daughter one dimensional and I honestly couldn't think this is further from the case. We see a key aspect of the film is honesty. That's what Brendan seeks from others and what his daughter tries to present to the world through her random posts on her facebook page of others when they least expect (or want it) presented. You could also say at this point it's a skewed honesty, a cynical one, showing her obese father and Thomas' smoking, of course as the angsty daughter who \"hates everyone\" (in her own words) it makes perfect sense. Then for Brendan, who asks honesty of both his daughter and his students, but of course only presents that honesty (by turning on his camera) in his final moments. He remains optimistic throughout the movie and it might seem questinoable, but for him life is still beautiful, just not his. He wishes to wallow in his self-loathing alone, he sees it as an issue unto himself and blames himself for it. Hence why he doesn't resent the world. I don't see this as a movie where it demands you have great sympathy for him through cheapt means, it's a movie that demands you accept him for who he is, the good and the bad. You accept that the eating disorder truly is disgusting and damaging in the worst way possible but you also see that he tries in his little ways to help others. He chooses not to get treatment and pretends the reason is because he wants more money for his daughter, though the reality is really that a \"helpful\" by-product of withholding treatment is that he no longer has to continue suffering in this life. It indicates the selfishness of his actions but simultaneously his desire to give to his daughter. One could make the case that the really caring thing for his daughter would've been to get the treatment he needed and make the changes in his life, much before it got to his point so that he could be in his daughter's life. Because really the money is irrelevant in the grands scheme. What matters is a Father showing love for his daughter. And that's why the final moments shine. Because for once in the last 9 years of his life he got up and \"fought\" in his own way for his daughter. He showed how much he cared and that that gift (showing he cares) will be much more beneficial than the windfall she will receive upon his death. There's so much to unpack in this movie. For example, he feeds the birds. And your initial impression of this is that he is a kind person who still cares for life in his own way. You later ssee, after his daughter notices this, and so does he, that the plate where the birds eat from has been broken. My interpretation is that the daughter broke it. And if you work from the assumption that she isn't really a bad person (she does things that may be an affront though still have a moral or impetus behind them) then you wonder why she did it. I believe the bird feeding is a metaphor, for feeding others unhealthy habits. It iss not good for a bird to rely on food from humans to survive, but of course it appears to be a nice thing to do in many cases upon shallow inspection. You could draw parallels to brendan and the nurse and whether it is a similar relationship, I'm not convinced that that relationship was so damaging however, it is true that in 9 years of the \"help\" his situation only deteriorated. The case could be made either way. And I love that about this movie. I truly don't think any of these characters are shallow at all. I found the Whale so incredibly captivating despite the movie confined physically to a single apartment and indeed that it gave the intentions and meaning behind the movie that much more room to flourish.",
  "A comeback for Brandon.": "One of the most moving films I've ever seen.This film had me sitting in utter silence at the end wondering what an amazing film I had just watched.I was stunned, enthralled, mesmerised and grossed out in equal measure. Absolutely staggering performances from the three main characters.Tight cinematography, color Grading, ambience and screenplay.Definitely Oscar worthy performance from Brendan Fraser. He deserves all the praise and was an enjoyable actor. He knew the difference between being an actor and being a \"Hollywood star\".It is real, raw, heartbreaking and emotional. It makes you think about life from multiple perspectives.It also paints a picture of how humanizing and self-destructing we can be to ourselves.",
  "Heart shattering": "A devastatingly beautiful manifestation of grief. This movie is a depiction of self harm and addiction often forgotten because of our own prejudice and society's notion that being fat is a choice instead of the sickness it can become. Every character was a person you've known; everyone was a person desperate for forgiveness and salvation through their connections with each other. This is grief in every form. Rebellion, attacking others to make them hurt too. Attempting to save others to save yourself from past transgressions or from the painful loss of another person. Yet through all this grief, there is the silver lining of Charlie, who despite his own afflictions, sees the positivity and good in others and wants them to succeed. This a remarkable story of compassion that could only ever be depicted by someone as compassionate as Brendan Fraser. I am excited to see what projects are in store for him next because I know he will definitely have the respect and empathy to step into any roll he chooses.",
  "Beautifully done": "This film was amazing. I have been wanting to watch this since I heard it was being made and was the number 1 movie that I was looking forward to all year. I did not have a dry eye throughout the whole movie. Brendan Fraser knocked it out of the park with an Academy Award-worthy performance as Charlie. He is such a phenomenal actor. His performance was so raw and so moving. The whole cast did an amazing job! I know I related to Charlie and how he was feeling. This is by far one of my favorite films. I cannot wait for this movie to be released on DVD/streaming because I will watch it many times.",
  "Amazing movie": "Arguably the saddest movie of 2022 and Brendan Fraser gave an amazing comeback with his breath taking performance, the build up to that last 10 minutes was amazing and I loved every single moment of it , Hong chau and Sadie sink also gave electrifying performances , the story line, the plot , the writing , everything was perfect , I hope Brendan wins the Oscar for this because he's a really good contender, this movie shows the struggle of resentment and disappointment and the feeling of disapproval even from your own family and the consequences of them , it showed trauma in a way I haven't seen on Tv before , I can't wait to see it again.",
  "Great performances not enough depth": "I feel this movie held great performances from Brendan Fraser and Sadie Sink. Brendan proves himself time and time again to be a great actor especially with the content provided to him. This film provides us with a character that from the start you can tell has so much depth to him but I feel he was not explored enough. I think the movie could have greatly benefited from more use of the medium it was using. By showing us instead of telling us everything this movie could have invoked much more emotion out of me. Instead it presents itself in a stiff manner, which I understand it might be trying to make me feel stuck in one place such as he literally is. I still feel by doing this it hurt the film much more than benefiting it. I think this would work phenomenally as a stage play rather than a film.",
  "A celebration of vulnerability!!": "I never write reviews, but this movie blew me away. Brendan Fraser played Charlie perfectly, like a tribute to vulnerability. Sadie Sink's, Ellie echoed, the power of unexpressed feelings gone haywire with total sincerity. Rounded off by a great cast, I did not want to miss a word of dialogue or look away. Aronofsky found the magic of his best films like Requiem and The Wrestler. A perfect 10!!Apparently you have to share 600 words in order submit your review. Now I understand why most of the reviews trail off or annoyingly re-tell the story. Is it this same sense of urging expression beyond one's ability that causes so many of the newer movies to last so long and say so little. When did our Attention Deficit community decide it needed more. Do they make more money for more words or more time on the screen? Of course the answer's, yes, inappropriately yesss!!This all speaks to what makes The Whale great, if anything, it left me wanting more...more of the... no spoilers here, nothing to worry about. Aronofsky, clearly has a grasp of the damage of holding our secrets, too deep, for too long. He also makes it clear that he knows the masses can relate. While the revealed secrets of his characters always payoff, it's the familiar tension that leads to the kind of pain that connects us all that will have me watching again (with a new box of Kleenex). Thank you for the experience!!",
  "A Whale of a Movie": "I already heard this movie was a tear jerker way before I watched it and deserving of awards. I have to admit I'm a Fraser fan since I first saw George of the Jungle. Then gems like Bedazelled and the Mummy trilogy. I can honestly say the guy is a really likeable hero of the big screen. But this movie... What can I say, they subtracted everything the man was known for? His good looks, incredible physic, and his goofy comedy. What I witnessed is another or perhaps the highest level an actor can ever achieve. I was in awe at how he portrayed the main character and really appreciate how he transformed himself not just physically. This is acting at it's finest and I really feel he should take major awards for this.But it's not just him. The co-stars are all well casted and well directed. I also have to remark on how Sadie Sink carried the role of a rebellious teenager. Her performance is simply stunning and I'm looking forward to her next projects. Of course the other performers were also amazing and I have to mention Hong Chau's remarkable portrayal.The story was compelling and relatable specially to people like myself and it will take a long time for the images from this movie to fade from my memory. This movie is one in a million and will touch you on many levels. I urge you to watch this with a box of tissue.",
  "heart crushing movie": "I was not expecting what I experienced at all. The story and the movie itself might not be that incredible but definitely very emotionally deep and touching and Brendan's performance was splendid. 10/10 of a performance, very visceral, very overwhelming, very real. Some characters, such as Sadie's, are decent; some I think were unnecessary. The movie does not talk about obesity itself but about depression, loss and grief. Might be difficult to watch for some people going through hard times... I don't remember ever being that crushed after watching a movie. Give yourself a chance to watch this.",
  "A Must-See Film: Why \"The Whale\" Deserves a 10/10 Rating": "The acting in \"The Whale\" is exceptional, with Brendan Fraser delivering a powerful and moving performance as Charlie. His portrayal of the character is both vulnerable and authentic, capturing the pain and suffering of a man struggling with his own demons. The chemistry between Fraser and his co-star, Julia Rehwald, who plays Becca, is also remarkable. Their on-screen relationship is heartwarming and inspiring, as they both learn from each other and find a way to heal.The movie's direction and cinematography are also top-notch, with director Darren Aronofsky delivering a visually stunning and emotionally impactful film. The use of close-up shots and slow-motion scenes add depth and nuance to the storytelling, capturing the inner turmoil of the characters and the beauty of the natural surroundings.One of the standout elements of the film is the way it addresses issues of weight and body image. Charlie's struggle with obesity is portrayed with sensitivity and respect, and the movie shows how society's obsession with appearance and weight can have a profound impact on a person's mental and emotional well-being. The film encourages viewers to look beyond surface-level appearances and see the humanity in others, regardless of their physical shape or size.\"The Whale\" also explores themes of forgiveness, redemption, and the power of human connection. It shows how even in the darkest moments of our lives, there is always hope for healing and growth. The movie's message is a powerful reminder that no one is perfect, and we all have the ability to learn, grow, and change.In conclusion, \"The Whale\" is a must-see film that deserves a 10/10 rating. It is a touching and emotional journey that will leave viewers inspired and moved. The movie's exceptional acting, direction, and cinematography, along with its powerful message, make it a standout film that is sure to leave a lasting impression.",
  "A Cinematic Story Perforfed Brilliantly By All Envolved Capturing Emotion": "The Whale brings the viewer on a story one that is very much like a rollercoaster of emotions and struggles. Brendan Fraser performs the role of Charlie with such passion, Grace and emotion that you can't help yourself but hope all the best for Charlie but his acceptance of his lifestyle grasps the viewers with so much power that you don't know if you should feel sad or happy due to him being happy and accepting. Sadie Sink plays her role as Ellie perfectly and shows true character arc and change when she gives in being bratty and means towards Charlie and then helps him relax as he smiles and admires her approach to people as he discovers in the film. The most powerful line in the entire masterpiece is \" People are amazing\" by Charlie as he never lets his struggles surpass his love for people who care and also his love for his family. To end it all off The Whale is a must watch and Brendan is very deserving of the awards he's won and the rest he most likely will receive as A24 studios show that they know how to make meaningful films in all types of genres .",
  "Spellbinding": "I normally do not like films which take place in a single setting but The Whale made me completely forget that notion. I was totally dialed in from the start to the end of the movie with Brendan Fraser's outstanding performance.it was at times painful to watch as you experience the suffering Charlie goes through to just semi function his way through the day. It was though I personally felt every ache and strain he experienced just moving his massive body short distances to the bathroom and beyond. The even truer suffering was the horribly sad and doomed look in Charlie's eyes knowing his life was soon coming to an end and has yet made any progress in trying to repair his relationship with his estranged daughter. I would have rated the movie a 10 but for the weak ending when Charlie finally reconciles with his daughter and then is sublimely lifted up to a heavenly scene from a previous memory of a better time in his life. I think a simple ray of sunshine on his peaceful face would have done the job. As I told my wife when I got home: it was a great movie but so hard to watchDan Rademeyer.",
  "Slow, depressing, pointless": "Honestly, all the reviews and hype about this had me anticipating a great movie. Fraser was always enjoyable in his earlier movies, even The Mummy. I made it up to 1hr 10min and just quit. It was just awful. The daughter was just ridiculous and annoying. Yeah, she had hang ups about her Dads choices, or whatever her mother told her. Who knows?The religious kid \"Thomas\" keeps coming around. Why? Because Charlie needs help! Spiritual help? So he says.Charlie's nurse or Doctor friend \"Liz\" checks on him everyday (I think), watching him eat himself to death. Charlie won't go to the hospital even when his blood pressure is literally as high as a Whales because he knows a visit will undoubtedly cost him 10's of 1000's of dollars, minimum (good ole US health care).Painfully slow and boring and set in Charlies house, because everyone seems to just drop in on him and he can't really leave.All this talk of Oscars is laughable. But we know the Oscars are a joke and always pushing a narrative. With all these gargantuan \"plus size\" models being pushed down our throats of late (some as big as Charlie). I'm probably going to be called \"fat phobic\" for not thinking Fraser deserves an Oscar for stuffing his face, crying and and wearing a fat suit.To be fair, I made it further into The Whale than I did Black Panther. A truly awful movie. 3 stars because I made it past halfway!",
  "MADE ME HUNGRY!": "Na but seriously, it's a good movie..\n.Ok, IMDB says I need more characters. Supposedly this movie had a lot more characters but Brendan Fraser ate them. Kidding of course. He was great. Glad to see him back. He'll probably get an award. Best Supporting Arches. Ok I gotta stop. This movie was seriously good. Never seen anything like it. Darren Aronofsky always delivers. Just like Brendan Fraser's pizza guy. NO NO NO NO. NOAH wasn't the best Aronofsky movie. More like No Ah Thank You. Now I sound Asian. I'm not being bigoted. That's probably the first thing bigots say though. Speaking of Big, you should see the........oh I just hit the limit. Kind of like Brendan Fraser's Blood Lipid Count. I'll see myself out.",
  "The acting!": "Every single actor in this movie was exceptional. Brendan was undoubtedly at his best here. I've seen him in movies from bedazzled, blast from the past, the mummy franchise and many more but I just feel he really let his acting emotion out in this movie.Sadie I know from Stranger Things and from thy series you can see she is a very good but in this she is absolutely world class. It has to be seriously rough to play such a horrendous person, especially in that scenario and no doubt with Brendan being lovely away from set.Hong Chau, Ty Simpkins and Morton were all also amazing and played the parts incredibly well.The movie I believe told it's story, nothing more and nothing less and told it very strongly.",
  "Profoundly Moving": "This is a movie you either get or you don't (sort by lowest rating to see who doesn't :-)). It's obviously adapted from a play, and takes advantage of the mobility of the camera to give us an intimacy that we could never have with the stage. The story is intriguing and reveals itself slowly, with tantalising threads coming together at the end. The only thing that seemed incongruous to me was Ellie asking a question with \"whom\" in it - I asked myself, would an American teenager, who hates writing essays, care to make the right choice between subject and object forms of pronouns? Did the writer do that deliberately, or did they inadvertently reveal themself...?The cast is superb and the performances are completely believable. I cheered Liz's gutsiness and felt Mary's pain. I don't assume I understood Charlie's reasoning, but I never questioned Brendan's portrayal. It's not easy to watch at times, but I came away with a profound sense of having witnessed something rare and wonderful.",
  "The best movie I've seen so far": "This is my first review and also the reason why I created an IMDb account in the first place. I was really impressed by the movie, the message of the movie and the performance of the actors (especially Brendan Fraser). It was incredible.I'm not gonna spoil the plot here, but everybody in the cinema hall was so impressed that they cried. Everybody. And I have never experienced people sitting in a cinema hall for so long after the end of the movie without moving or leaving as I experienced today.Well done with the movie! And thank you for this experience. I would sincerely and highly recommend this movie.",
  "The whale": "I one, loved this movie to death, one of the most realistic and most touching ground to piece movie. Not only has this movie touched me but also made me idk rethink about my choices in life. As this movie send a message\"everyone has a redemption\" you just need to have hope. This movie is far the best movie I've seen that makes me ball my eyes out. I loved it loved loved it. And there's no more words or saying that can describe what I feel about this movie. This movie was just a master piece from the beginning to the ending as not for once did I fall asleep in this flim as the film it self was raw and perfect.",
  "Evaluate the main character's representation": "Having the character portrayed by Brendan Fraser after such a long absence due to illness was great. I hope he gets an Academy Award for this acting that touched me, because I am also overweight. The secondary characters were very good. The weather was hazy in the movie, the music was good enough I think, and Liz was the best of the sub characters, which is why I gave it an 8, not for the story, which might be fine, I don't like men who have sex with men. The output was fine. The director is known for his good directing. Congratulations on the work, Brendan Fraser's next work is eagerly awaited.",
  "Good acting boring movie - The Phonebooth in a room": "Don't get me wrong this is the best you wil see Brendan Frazier. He's acting is on point and rips into your soul. Does that make it a good movie? Well no! The movie basically never moves outside of the living room and it gets old fast.Firstly why does every single movie have to be about non straight people. Straight people are still 95% of the population. I don't have a care in the world with what you do with your own life. But if I'm not into that,then I'm not into that and I lose intreast in a movie the moment I get forced to partake. The fact that the characters is gay adds nothing to the film except that we have to constantly hear about another gay mans struggles.But even with me finiding zero interest in the sexual preference of the lead characters, the movie itself is just boring and kinda predictable.Overhyped because of good acting in my book and that's because films in general have become so bad that when you see a good performance people believed the film is automatically also good.It's like with The Joker great acting horrbley boring movie. I guess if you liked that,you will like this.",
  "Thanks!!!": "On the eve of the Oscars (12 March), I decided to leave a review for \"The Whale\".And so I will say that so far we haven't seen this film as a family and I'm still not ready for it. So, I saw it sneakily, alone, constantly stopping at tears flowing that no one else can see. I've honestly watched thousands of films and I don't remember anything affecting me so much in the last 20 years.How is it that such a handsome man as Fraser plays such an eternally sweaty mountain of fat, living on a mixture of pizza and medication? How is it that Professor Charlie's fat is everyone's barrier against loneliness and pain. By which we seem to shield ourselves from serious challenges, but. Which still only makes us clumsy and helpless.The film in general is small, chamber-like, with a minimum of actors. I don't think everyone will like it either. Some fat professor with everything hurting inside and out is fighting with his evil daughter all the time. What makes you want to cry all the time? The irreversibility of time, our own time. The palpable horror of the irreparable death in front of you in the film - that somewhere in the world at this moment someone wonderful, amazing, wonderful is irreparably dying, and you can do nothing to help him. From the beauty and sincerity of true love. From the desperation of the effort with which it sprouts through anger, pain and death. To be reflected and remain in a child's eyes.Honestly, I don't really care if Brendan Fraser gets an Oscar.He's soaring much higher. Like Jonathan Seagull.Thank you so much for having this film with me.",
  "A must see": "Darren Aronofsky's adaptation of Samuel D. Hunter's heartbreaking play is not only powerful and eye-opening, but also a crushingly honest tale about mental illness, family-bonding and redemption which sum everything up as a breathtaking cinematic experience thanks to a lifetime performance from Brendan Fraser. It was such a touching story and every actor and actress in this movie did such a great job. It's not easy for me to cry in a theater but this one really got me. The Whale is a must see movie and I hope everyone involved (both in front of and behind the camera) gets the praise and awards that they deserve.",
  "criticism of \"religion\", \"divinity\" and \"humanity\"": "Darren once again turned out a good play to explore the psychological subtlety of the characters. With Charlie played by Brandon Fisher as the core, he weaved a solid network of characters between him and his same-sex lover, his sister, ex-wife, daughter, and neighbors. With the help of reflection and even criticism of \"religion\", \"divinity\" and \"humanity\", their interaction sometimes became absurd and ironic, sometimes gripping. Although the story scene almost happens in the room, and the script is also born out of the drama, the precise scene scheduling eliminates the drying up of the excessive stage drama, and the final ending adds a magic color. Brandon Fisher has dedicated the most breakthrough and subversive role since the film. Even if he can only sit on the sofa and perform the whole time, he can also convey the despair of a dying person, the guilt of looking back on his life and the worry of others when they see his true appearance with his eyes and facial expressions. His overweight posture makes his body expression take on a new look. Even the simplest bending action takes a long time and is full of heartache.",
  "I don't see this movie rated below 8": "First of all, I want to thank the one and only Brendan Fraser for the amazing dedication to his role and an amazing performance like none other. You've made my childhood, and you deserve everything going your way.Before I watched the movie, I tried reading the reviews first from the general audience. Some said that the movie lacks in writing and is edited way too much in post-production. Don't worry. I'm not judging or anything. I understand why you said that.But as a writer myself, if you say that this movie lacks in writing, then you'll probably be rating 85% of the movies that exists in the film industry right now, extremely terrible and not even worth your time. I was captivated throughout the entire two hour runtime. I was star-strucked by how pent-up Charlie's emotions are. Not knowing what to believe, and what to do with his anger.I just hope that you can come across this review and try to give the movie a watch. It's definitely not for everyone - these types of movie and I get it. But in my opinion, we should be getting more of these kinds of movies, instead of becoming an ant- Woah there... Straying way too far.Thank you A24, Darren Aronofsky, the casts, and the crew for such a beautiful movie, and thank you for reading. Have a nice day.",
  "Ugh": "The only reason I give the movie even 2 stars is because Brendan Fraser's acting was exceptional. I don't know how he could have performed it any better.Having said all of the above, the movie was awful. It is highly predictable and if you enjoy watching a movie that is full of dysfunctional people with no redeeming value then this is the movie for you. I am so tired of movies with bratty kids that do their best to make their parents look stupid. I get the background and why she is supposed to be this way, but I have grown tired of seeing this in every show.They even went so far as to make the Christian look stupid.",
  "Believe the Hype": "Once in a while a movie comes along that reminds you why you slog through the dross that proliferates our screens daily. The Whale is an extremely honest look at one man's depression and the self destructive behaviour it can drive a person to. What could be a bleak deep dive into a person's slow suicide is transformed into a somehow inspirational tale thanks to Brendan Fraser's remarkable performance. This movie is going to win many well deserved awards and all of the supporting cast are great as well, there's no two dimensional characters here. An easy film to recommend to anyone looking for a substantial exploration of humanity and the feelings that drive us.",
  "A poignant & beautiful whale of a tale": "This movie had me in a trance from the start. Brendan Fraser's portrayal of this character has me in awe from the get-go. I don't recall the last time I actually shed tears over a movie. The cinematography was wonderfully executed. Each character intricately & beautifully introduced & bound together in some way, whether they liked it or not. I was fascinated by the way the trauma played out. His partner unable to eat, while he could not stop. It truly opened my eyes to how much we judge people, never knowing quiet what they're going through. Brendan Fraser is back & I couldn't be happier. PS I'm surprised this movie is not getting 10's all around!!",
  "Just wow.": "This movie was simply amazing. Brendan Frasier, along with his costars, did a spectacular job in their roles in making you feel everything you can feel while watching a movie; happiness, laughter, caring, disgust at some parts, pity, sadness, anger.. name it, you feel it all.Went to see this movie with my family with the intent to have supper after but we were feeling so \"down\" after the movie, some of us in tears, that we ended up just going straight home.If a movie is able to move people to that extent, where you feel its effects long after the credits have finished, it is highly succesful in what it was trying to project. Hands down, one of the most heartfelt, heartbreaking and amazing movies I've seen.",
  "Pretty weak script and performances (apart from Fraser)": "I was going into the movie with high expectations and unfortunatelly was severly dissapointed. I see this movie has a great reviews and great score on IMDB, it also received some awards I believe but I have hard time understanding why. I gave this movie 3 out of 10 and all the stars went to Fraser, who played the part really well and I think he's the only reason to watch this movie at all. I felt like the script was very weak, we don't really know much about the characters, they make very substantial and big statements throughout the movie but they don't really back them up which makes this movie look very preachy at times.All the characters (maybe apart from the mother) are awful and very shallow, for example Liz is this controlling person that creates this appearance of care but in reality she's very self centered and she doesn't do what's best for Charlie, but what will make her feel good. It's very easy to tell Charlie to go hospital, it's much harder not to give him a bucket with chicken wings when he asks. Also she's very bossy and looks down and everyone. She feels like a snake in human form.Ellie is this angsty teenager that hates everyone and we learn it's because she thinks she's worthless because her father left her and while this might be realistic, the way she's portrayed is also awful. And here lies another problem with the movie - sometimes it's hard to say if this immature behavior from Ellie is just her being a teenager and having problems with her emotional self (as we all did, can't fool the hormones) or if what's she's saying and doing is supposed to carry some meaning for us. Really, what she does is awful, we understand in this movie that she didn't have easy life, but objectively she's an awful person. Also, Charlie knows nothing about her, he constantly repeats the mother tells him nothing about her and he's got one essay from four years before to base his whole opinion of her on, and yet he claims she's an amazing person and I believe we are supposed to feel the same way, but his opinion is based on nothing and from what we've heard from the mother and from what we see she's done in the movie, there is really nothing to corroborate this opinion.That missionary guy seems interesting at start, although he comes across very artificial, almost a carricature of a human being. He's pushed around and has no conviction and as soon as he learns his parents won't send him to jail, he forgets everything about his mission and just goes home. It feels like he's just a backdrop for other characters to preach their convictions without giving any argument for their opinions, as this character is not pushing back at any point in the movie. The scene through the closed door with Ellie and the guy (i forgot his name) felt very forced and unnatural and it was basically her stating his belief doesn't make any sense and that's it. No discussion, no arguments, nothing, he's just a backdrop. Very dissapointing.As for the mother character, she was surprisingly interesting - she came across flat at some points, but at others she had some bone in her body, which makes her the most human like character in this movie.Charlie, now let's talk about the elephant in the room, or should I say, whale. Fraser was great, he was very convincing in his role, although the writers seem to be very confused. At the end, I'm not sure if his final intentions were pure or if he was self absorbed to the very end. You would think that all he wanted was this honesty, but it didn't feel that strongly and it was mixed with the other message, that he wanted to feel that his life wasn't for nothing and he did something good and those two thoughts didn't play very well toghether. There were some very strong points to his character, like when he tried to destroy himself by eating but then sometimes it feels like he's doing it to spite himself and sometimes to spite other people (Dan in particular).The direction was decent in general, although I'm not sure about this whole counting of days. I understand it was to show that all the action is taking place day after day, as it's not that obvious from what's happening in the movie (you could very well suspect the action is stretched across few weeks). I think if they maybe stretched the action to seven days, to wrap it up in a full week, it would feel more at the right place, and as for how it is in the movie, it just kind of breaks the fourth wall.I'd say Fraser was great as an actor, the script was bad, the direction was decent. Charlie was a confused 2,5 dimensional character, the mother was also almost 3d, the daughter was 2 dimensional and the rest were one dimensional. The characters were mostly superficial, preachy (again) and closed minded. There were some strong points and interesting developments, but in general it felt preachy, without a real bone in it and a bit confused. I didn't like the movie very much.",
  "Weak plot with a lot of useless elements": "Not much happens throughout the movie. Don't expect any surprise, revelation, suspense, or else. It's a flat movie with angry and sad characters.One of the main characters (the missionary) is absolutely useless to the plot and movie.So many aspects of the plot that made no sense.the best friend rejecting his daughter when she came to visit? Why? When it could have been the only thing giving him hope and desire to live? How does this make sense?the main character repeating his daughters essay before he goes to sleep? Is that supposed to be touching? It's not credible.Also, the main character basically refusing to get help supposedly to give money to his daughter - great way to start a life for her? Living with the guilt of her father having basically killer himself for her. Stupid.There is no beauty in this movie. The only thing the movie does is to build on the viewers disgust (including strongly emphasized chewing noises) and the viewers pity (dramatic music, lots of yelling and crying throughout the movie) to make us shed a tear in the theater. At the end, we don't even learn much about the main character.",
  "Brendan Excells - Mediocre Movie": "I really wanted to like this movie because I love Brendan as an actor. Unfortunatelly, it's nothing special, everything happens in the same room with random people entering an appartment were the main character lives. It does shows some of the problems of modern life and people that stragle with life/weight/problems but everything is thown into your face sometimes in slow pace and sometimes fast. It's a mess. Usually if you like a movie you'll watch it a second time. This is not the case. You watch this movie only to enjoy Brendan Fraser's performance. He is the one holding the movie and making it watchable.",
  "Fraser will get an Oscar but it seemed kinda weird": "The acting was top notch stuff, he brought tears to my eyes. The film itself had very anti religious and pro gay agenda but for me it ruined the arc I was interested in, the story of father and daughter. His acting in the last few scenes were Oscar worthy without a doubt and I'm sure he ll win. The makeup is about as realistic as you can get. I would love it if now and then Christianity would be treated with some respect in Hollywood, it's a bit sad that they put it down as much they do. A lot of the film just didn't seem to make sense though, the missionary seemed shoe horned in at times and people just seemed to keep running into his house like an episode of friends. I was left thinking , weird film, not really that great but unbelievable acting.",
  "Love Fraser, hate this movie": "Seriously, I like. Fraser and wish him the best and success, I hope he comes back strong in Hollywood, but this movie was not it. I didn't enjoy it at all, it was hard to finish, I welcomed breaks when they would come, but I am the type of person that when I start a movie, no matter how bad, I have to see it through. That made getting through this movie all that much worse. I imagine if I go to hell, this will be one of the movies I am tortured with, yes I disliked it that much. Seeing the high amount of ratings it got, I guess I'm just that uncultured, but I accept that. My advise, if dramas aren't your thing, skip this movie.\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb"
