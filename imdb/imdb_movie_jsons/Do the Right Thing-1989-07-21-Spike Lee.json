            "content": "90% of Spike Lee's masterpiece Do the Right Thing is a perfectly developed character study of a wide range of model personalities who all happen to be in Bedford-Stuyvesant on the hottest day of the summer. What the other ten percent consists of you will have to discover for yourself.This ingenious film explores extremes, but never gives itself over to stereotypes as its plot cleverly navigates through the politics of inner city life and the struggles of American racism. As an artful and intelligent examination of the ethics of violence and prejudice, Do the Right Thing is unparalleled. It implies a simple profound question - what is the 'right thing'? But steadfastly refuses to supply even a hint of an answer - appropriately leaving its central point entirely up to its audience. Instead, the film points to a different, perhaps more important question \"Whose version of right is right for you?\" There are a lot of good people, a lot of bad people, and a very realistic majority of people who are usually somewhere in the middle but also somewhat confused throughout this film. African American, Latino, East Asian and Italian American cultures form the dynamics of the relationships that drive the story, and conflict is their medium. Drawing from two incisive but different comments on violence from Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, Lee extrapolates his story and the ideas he wants to explore by showing us characters that are as real as they are exaggerated and somewhat unpredictable events that they create, are swept into or actively or passively participate in. Although the point of the film is not really critique, nobody is left unscathed.I am not going to tell you what the film says - I can't, because it is, more than most films dealing in such a direct manner with the subject of race, open to interpretation. And what you bring to it will influence, but not determine what you take away from it. It is just that powerful.Instead, I will simply give Do the Right Thing my highest recommendation.Superbly written, edited, directed and filmed. Well acted (Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Giancarlo Esposito, Rosie Perez, Spike Lee and Richard Edson really stood out for me) and very nicely soundscaped, Do the Right Thing is the perfect film for a solitary night of reflection or for sharing with an intelligent group of friends. However, be forewarned, the film hits hard, and will disturb some people a great deal - especially those who feel a need for closure and resolution.",

            "content": "In all likelihood Spike Lee's most important achievement - as director, writer and actor (though to my taste Mo' Better Blues is just as good a picture) and one of the strongest films you'll see about race relations, 'Do The Right Thing' looks dated at times, but it lost none of its impact and relevance. The movie takes place in a particularly hot day in a primarily African-American neighborhood in Brooklyn, and follows the various personalities who live there throughout the day; the center of the story is Sal's Famous Pizzeria - its owners, some of the few white people living in the neighborhood: Sal (Oscar nominated performance for Danny Aiello) and his two sons (John Torturro and Richard Edson), and Mookie (Spike Lee himself), the black delivery boy. What starts out as a light, entertaining movie with some amusing characters and light humor, gradually builds up tension to the point of being unbearable, up to the dramatic and tragic climax. Spike doesn't put as much emphasis on the characters themselves as he does on the relationships and the tension between them; and in this image of a very specific and small frame in time and place, makes a strong and important message about racism and race relations in general. The film is populated with many different characters, all of them very memorable and each one a representative of a certain belief, mode of behavior or state of mind - on both sides of the conflict. From the uninhibited anger of Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) and Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) on one side and Pino (John Torturro) on the other side, to Jade (Joie Lee, Spike's sister in the film and in real life) and Vito (Richard Edson), who are trying to connect and live at peace with the other side, to Da Mayor (Ossie Davis), in his isolated but peaceful state of mind, living in complete peace with the world around him, and Smiley (Roger Smith), living in his own isolated existence. Then there's Mookie, who is stuck in the middle, torn between his commitment and responsibilities to both sides. Finally we have Mister Senor Love Daddy - played gorgeously by the one and only Samuel L. Jackson, in one of his finest performances - half active character and half all-knowing narrator - who represents the voice of reason in the conflict, the reason which is bound, ultimately, to collapse. Each and every character plays an important part in the climatic and dramatic conflict to which the movie builds up, and though it's the radical ones - Buggin Out and Radio Raheem - who trigger the events that cause the tragedy, they are not necessarily the ones who finish it. It is Mookie and Sal, in fact, who ultimately play the main part.Do The Right Thing is not an easy watch; it's a mesmerizing, tense, difficult film that breaks many taboos and slaughters many holy cows. But in the end of it - hopefully - you'll be wiser than you were in the beginning, and that's what Lee have always tried to achieve in all his films. Watch it to get a real view on racism that doesn't duck the difficult issues and isn't afraid to tackle the real problem, and to see a master director at work. It's one of the best films of its time.",

            "content": "\"Do the Right Thing\" is a powerful, uplifting, visually stunning masterpiece.  It's a movie that I can watch over and over again, and deservedly takes the Number 7 Spot of My Favorite Movies Of All Time.  This was one of Spike's debut efforts, and until this day--the best one.  Spike gives us an honest, unflinching look at the Bedford-Stuyvestant area of Brooklyn on the hottest day of the summer.  He perfectly displays the racial tensions that go on between everybody from blacks to whites to Koreans.  Yet he never gets preachy, which is one of the brilliant things about this movie.  Some of Spike's best work is demonstrated in his shots of Radio Raheem, played excellently by Bill Nunn.  RR doesn't say much, but he has this violent gaze which sums up his feelings without a word being said. Spike gives us some great angles of his face, demonstrating the pure rage brewing inside of him.  He also has a great scene in which he sums up the meanings of love and hate, in Spike's trademark poetry-in-motion style.  RR constantly carries around a boombox, playing the same song \"Fight the Power\" by Public Enemy.  That song is one of the best musical themes in movie history, perfectly summing up racial tension among inner cities.  This movie doesn't tell its audience that black people are better than others, nor does it say that Hispanics are, or whites, or Asians.  It just gives us a raw look at what happens when we let racial quarrels get out of hand.  We learn how sometimes it's appropriate to preach against racism, and sometimes we're just overreacting.The cast is terrific, and they deliver memorable performances.  I really wish Danny Aiello picked up the Oscar for his role as Sal, because that is definitely the pinnacle performance of his career and one of the best I've ever seen.  Other noteworthy performances are by John Turturro, Ossie Davis and Giancarlo Esposito.  The film is put together with such fast-paced editing that it doesn't once get boring, doesn't have any low points.  This is a gritty, memorable film that I wish can be considered more prominent in the eyes of the average moviegoer, because it really deserves great recognition for its unique, unforgettable style.  Spike definitely knows how to do the right thing.My score:  10 (out of 10)",

            "content": "Spike Lee's celebrated magnum opus, Do the Right Thing, is too interesting and too thought-provoking to be bad. It's also too muddled, confused, and hateful to be worthy of my praise.The story of boiling racial tension on a hot summer day in New York is exceptional in the way it visualizes how a normal day can turn explosive when hidden prejudices bubble to the surface, and a perfect storm of grievances click in at once. The structure, the writing, the deft direction (for most of the runtime) is as expertly done as you've heard. So much so that I can clearly see how this film can be considered one of the very best of the 1980s. A film so provocative and unique (in its visual style and hip-hop rhythm) can't be dismissed entirely. Yet, I can't bring myself to champion Do the Right Thing.It's a movie that forces you to chew on its ideas. However, what to make of the movie when those ideas are kind of stupid? First, let's clear up what Do the Right Thing is trying to say about race relations. The plot goes: several ethnic groups peacefully cohabitate a lower-class New York neighborhood until a small perceived grievance (No black people's pictures hanging on the wall of the Italian Pizzeria) grows and grows into an eventual race riot, perpetrated by the film's protagonist (Spike Lee himself as Mookie). Then, in a final title card, Spike Lee shows quotes from both Martin Luthor King Jr. and Malcom X. Peace vs righteous violence. The last image is meant, I believe, to force us to confront whether Mookie did... the Right Thing. Here is where my problems with Do the Right Thing begin. The way Spike Lee sets up this conflict, he makes it too clear that, no, Mookie did NOT do the right thing by throwing a trash can through the window of an innocent pizza shop owner. His Italian characters, the supposed instigators, are innocent of everything but being fed up with black people in general because they are fed up with the individual black people harassing them at work. But Sal, played by Danny Aiello in the movie's best performance, is actually a friend to the community, a helper, a mentor. And yet, we're supposed the question whether burning his shop down was okay by the end? The black characters, however, are just kind of bums overall; making demands about how Sal decorates his shop, sitting at home ignoring a girlfriend while on the clock at work. and getting violent once their precious boombox is destroyed. There is nothing wrong with these characterizations, but they run contrary to the message we are supposed to get in the final 15 minutes.Once the tensions actually do explode, I find it difficult to believe that anyone, black, white, or other, can be on the side of Mookie and his pals. They are portrayed so unsympathetically that it completely muddles Lee's own message. If not for the sudden deus ex machina death of Radio Raheem at the hands of police, there would not be a single counterpoint to balance the obvious moral high ground of Sal. So, ultimately, the movie doesn't work. Mookie was in the wrong. I don't feel bad for him and I don't feel bad for the other rioters. Spike Lee fails. The message does not register.Because, you see, the whole argument, if you can call a shrugging, \"I guess we're all just hateful and will always be hateful\" an argument, only works if we believe Malcolm X had a point; if we question whether Mookie was justified in starting a riot. If that were the case, we would look at that final title card and question whether we should stand stoically against hatred or fight back. But Mookie is an chump. He's a lazy bum who destroys the livelihood of his community's strongest father figure. Spike, what on earth were you thinking with this character? Those last 15 minutes don't make me question whether Malcolm X was right, they confirmed to me that he was wrong.56/100",

            "content": "If I had to make a list of the top ten things that I find most boring, racism would be right at the summit along with economics and The Blair Witch Project. For that reason, I have avoided Do the Right Thing up until now for fear that it would be a lecture on racism...but actually, I don't know what I was afraid of, as this film is really good. Spike Lee's racial drama is actually more a film about the feebleness of racial divides and how violence only breeds violence, as opposed to a film ABOUT racism. In fact, the film can be best described as a cinematic materialisation of Martin Luther King's famous \"an eye for an eye leaves everybody blind\" speech.For this movie, Spike Lee has put together a terrific cast, that includes many actors that have gone on to become big names in the movie industry, people such as Samuel L. Jackson, John Turturro and Martin Lawrence, not to mention smaller stars such as Ossie Davis. The cast comes together excellently and the neighbourhood that Spike Lee has created for this film feels very real, and through the multiple personalities that inhabit it, it manages to stay interesting and realistic throughout. The atmosphere of the neighbourhood is also of note, and you really do get the feeling that someone could say 'biatch' or 'dogg' at any time. Spike Lee delights in showing us many different people, and at different times - including their reactions to certain events and their interactions with each other, and it all helps to build up both their own characters and the neighbourhood that they live in. This proves to be invaluable to the film as it has no real plot and therefore relies on the characters and the neighbourhood that it has created to build itself, it's scenario and therefore it's message, up.Do the Right Thing is a portrait of how multiple cultures live together in modern day America and it also succeeds in being a stark and potent portrayal of how violence never gets anyone anywhere. Spike Lee has shown his talents as an actor, director and a writer with this film, and even though majority opinion of him seems to be that he's a disagreeable old crone; at least he's one that has talent.",

            "content": "After watching Do the Right Thing (1989), I feel somewhat confused. I feel like the message of anti-racism got lost in the chaotic shuffle that was the end of the film. The majority of the movie, in my opinion, was a comedic and lighthearted portrayal of the race relations in American cities. The characters were constantly arguing, but never in a way where I felt like something violent was going to happen. I found myself disappointed and even a little angry at the way things turned out for everyone in the end. I believe Sal over-reacted by smashing Raheem's boom box, but Raheem never should have barged into the store. The police were obviously out of line in killing Raheem. I just don't see why everyone so easily turned on Sal, someone they had known for a long time and who they knew had no negative feelings about them. Mookie I feel did the most unpredictable thing by throwing the trash can through the window of the pizza shop. He figuratively lit the match that started the angry mob. And he did this after Sal told him he would always have a place at Sal's pizza shop. And Mookie and Sal weren't even enemies at the end of the movie. I guess if Spike Lee was meaning to make the ending chaotic and hard to understand, he did a good job.",

            "content": "This was my first Spike Lee film and I didn't know what to anticipate, half expecting it to be an all black cast picture dealing with family or neighborhood relationships. So seeing Danny Aiello show up early set me up for something perhaps more interesting, that is, Lee's take on racial relations and tensions in a mixed neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. The suggestion that it was one of the hottest days of the year seemed to point toward an eventual outburst in which one or more characters would eventually reach their own boiling point, resulting in some form of violence.Lee directs himself as one of the principal players named Mookie, an employee of Sal's (Aiello) Famous Pizzaria. There's a dichotomy in the portrayal of Sal's two sons - Pino (John Turturro) is inherently racist, but doesn't expose those feelings openly, as he realizes he has to live and work in the neighborhood. Vito (Richard Edson) however, has no trouble showing friendship with Mookie, and as the younger brother, appears to be more tolerant with the diversity around him. In the middle in terms of temperament is Sal, having lived and built a business in the community for twenty five years, and coming to realize that the predominantly black community is basically decent and supportive of his shop.I'm not clear why Spike Lee would have presented so many of his characters as borderline delinquents. A white director using the same prescription would undeniably be viewed as racist. However his intent, if it was to portray a poor black neighborhood plagued by unemployment and lack of opportunity, was an effective way in which to advance the story to it's flash point. At that moment though, I was jarred by the action of both Sal AND Mookie. Granted, we knew Sal could be a hothead, but destroying the boombox was stepping over the line. Mookie's response likewise, by throwing a garbage can through Sal's window seemed totally out of character. I'm sure the unintended consequence of what followed was the main part of the message Lee was attempting to convey, that is, violence for the sake of violence can never be an answer because it produces victims in it's wake. I would have said innocent victims, except Radio (Bill Nunn) had some culpability in what happened to trigger the riot, but he didn't have to die as a result, even if by accident.Interestingly, Lee establishes the neighborhood old timer, Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) as the voice and conscience of Bed-Stuy, someone who's been around the block a few times and realizes he can role model good behavior for the youth of the community. Da Mayor was the picture's 'do the right thing' guy, but it's all the wrong things that happen in the story that force the viewer to examine one's own prejudices and sympathies. \"Do the Right Thing\" is the kind of film that leaves one with more questions than answers, which can be a good thing if those questions lead to an honest examination of why differences among people shouldn't get in the way of standing on common ground.",

            "content": "On the hottest day of the year in Brooklyn, plenty of activity is going on around Sal's Famous Pizzeria, an Italian restaurant in the middle of a black neighborhood. But tension mounts and sooner or later something has got to give. What happens when people stop being nice and start being real? I have some immense issues with this film. Now, the film is interesting and well-made and the characters are cool. Sam Jackson shows up, Danny Aiello and John Turturro are great. Ossie Davis gives a memorable performance, and Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\" remains constantly in the background. (Martin Lawrence and Rosie Perez also make debut performances here.) So, don't get me wrong, the set-up is there. But my issue is with Spike Lee.The film is ambiguous, which is both its strength and its weakness. By contrasting Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, we are unclear if the film endorses violence or not. But Spike Lee's one words seem to suggest violence is justified. At the climax, Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) demands that Sal post photos of black celebrities on his wall. Sal refuses, and further asks Raheem to leave because he blasts his music in the restaurant. Before long, Raheem attacks Sal, the cops are called and Raheem is killed. A riot breaks out and Sal's is burnt to the ground.Lee has said white viewers don't understand the film because they rank \"white property\" over a \"black life\". Well, I'm a white viewer. And I don't think Raheem should have died, but I see no justification for Sal's to be destroyed. Sal was a fine member of the community and he was not responsible for Raheem's death, the police were. Both the property damage and murder were wrong -- I think Lee is off-base to make it an either/or scenario.Now, he leaves himself an out by having Da Mayor express the greatest lesson in life is \"do the right thing\", and the moral of the story could be that practically nobody in this film did the right thing. So it could be shown that the movie is teaching us right by showing us wrong. But Lee's words don't suggest this interpretation, and his lead character, Mookie, clearly favors unnecessary violence (which Malcolm X may have wrongly termed \"self-defense\").The American Film Institute puts this as one of the top 100 films of all time. Even the Library of Congress has had the film preserved as culturally significant. I don't want to say they're wrong, but I'm very unclear about this film. On one hand, it certainly sparks discussion and has had my brain thinking constantly for the past week -- more than any other movie in years. But, also, the message seems like one that may not be something we want to preserve. Am I missing something? Why do I want to watch this movie again?",

            "content": "A scorching summer day brings racial tensions to their boiling point in a Brooklyn neighborhood. Seen through many points of view Spike Lee paints a convincing and critical picture of tensions in the most diverse city in the USA.The film's strength is its ability to ring true to many sets of ears and especially if you frequent or live in a big city. You always here of events - big and small - on the news and there is usually that element of \"racial tensions\" or \"possible racial motive.\" In a city where over 200 different languages are spoken (which can give you an idea of how many distinguishable cultures there are) it is only a natural ingredient for friction between people. Whether you hate the other guy, or are just annoyed that you can't understand him nor he you, when all you want to do is buy some groceries. This film shows many situations of this type and how everyone is, in a sense, innocent and guilty at the same time. If a situation gets out of hand and you have people throwing slurs at each other there is that famous expression: \"he crossed the line.\" Well even with critical hindsight, this \"line\" isn't always visible and when it is, it's faint.Spike Lee manages to show that very well and with a lot of diverse characters, hence the film being able to ring true with an equally diverse audience.The only problem is that in today's America the issue is more about class and not just race, though race and class are intertwined. \"Crash\" presented the issue of class and lifestyle a little bit more thoroughly, but in the end felt preachy and unrealistically sentimental. \"Do the Right Thing\" is much tighter and the film's climax and overall impact is more powerful. Also of the note is the terrific acting from the entire cast. --- 9/10Rated R for profanity and some violence",

It's extraordinarily dated, having been copied in a billion rap videos and even The Cosby Show, and, today, it seems very silly. As the film progresses, you're likely to notice dozens of other instances of severe dating that might make you giggle. Heck, if you didn't know that he was in it already, you're sure to laugh a little when you see that Martin Lawrence is in the film. Why did this dating happen? Well, simply because the film was so influential that other artists co-opted pieces of it all over the place. This would destroy a regular movie. Fortunately, Do the Right Thing is no ordinary movie.This truly is one of the best films ever made. It's a masterpiece by one of the most talented and, unfortunately, most maligned directors alive. Spike Lee does not have the answers to the questions he poses, and sometimes I do object to the way he handles the situation. Sometimes I do ask the questions, when I am watching one of his films, \"why does he have to be so angry about everything? Why doesn't he try to think these things out?\" But I have great empathy for all emotions, and Lee is great at expressing his feelings on film. When I watch his films, I sympathize with what is happening. Do the Right Thing is pitched at a feverish pace, and it's filled with enormous joy and, simultaneously, with enormous anger. This ambiguous mood is expressed most directly by the character Radio Rahim in a scene adapted from the great film Night of the Hunter, where Radio recites Robert Mitchum's \"The Battle Between Love and Hate\" speech. Immediately in the film we see that the races are capable of getting along. One black man is angry that Sal, who owns the local pizzeria, only hangs up pictures of Italian Americans on his wall, but no African Americans. Other African Americans find his objection somewhat ridiculous and respect Sal very much. Some African Americans object to a Korean couple who have successfully opened a grocery store on a certain corner, but others believe they are just savvy businessmen. On the other hand, there is a great amount of tension between the same races. Sal is basically a good man, but he has grown very hard and his temper is short. Radio Rahim walks in and, yes, rudely leaves his radio blasting while he tries to buy some pizza. However, did Sal really have to swear and order him to turn the radio off? Couldn't he, as Radio wonders later on, have at least said please? Lee's feelings about the entire situation are clearly ambiguous. The entire film is felt deeply, and there is never any intellectualizing in the script. It is vitally important that Lee casts himself as Mookie, a young, shiftless man who works as a deliveryman for Sal. It is Mookie who has the choice of whether to do the right thing or not. Perhaps some will be less forgiving about the film's late 1980s trappings. Even if they find it silly or unwatchable, I will guarantee that in 30 years, when the 1980s and even 1990s are far behind us, Do the Right Thing will be considered one of America's greatest films, as it more than deserves to be right now, in 2001. 10/10.",

Mookie is a lazy delivery boy at Sal's who has a girlfriend and a baby that he doesn't support. Samuel L. Jackson plays the local DJ who is ultimately the voice of reason in the film. There are a slew of backup characters, nearly all of whom play important roles. Radio Raheem, Da Mayor, Sal's sons, Jade, and many others are vital to the film.If I had to guess why some people don't like this film, I would say it's due to the fact that there are no good guys. There aren't even any bad guys. There is no one to root for because everyone is guilty. Spike Lee's magnum opus examines the deterioration of characters incredibly. You can feel the characters wearing thin as the hot day drags on and tension mounts. The only flaw of the film is that the subplot of Mookie's relationship with Tina flip-flops, but even that is for a purpose. Don't let the handful of vocal naysayers keep you from watching this indie masterpiece.",

            "content": "I did not like \"Do the Right Thing\" very much at all. For one thing it's boring, with much of the film's screen time wasted on pointless subplots like Mook's relationship with his girlfriend. But mainly I don't like it because it's clearly a message movie, except it's message is super unclear and confusing. For 90% of the film I thought that Mook was supposed to be the moral hero of the story because he works at the Italian restaurant and empathizes with its owners. But then at the end he causes the destruction of the restaurant, his own place of employment and the livelihood of his supposed friends. A lot of people think he did this to help Sal, but then why would he go back and poor salt in the wound the next morning? Admittedly I really didn't get it. I thought it was either a movie about a large group of unintelligent, angry inner-city residents, which was meant to show people the error of their ways (a cause that to me seemed like it would be ineffective and rather self-destructive); or I though it could be a championing bravado meant to invigorate African American audiences (a theory supported by the overplayed \"fight the power\" ). Neither of my theories felt like they could be accurate. I decided I needed to read some analyses of the film to better understand, and from reading them I've learned that.... I still don't get it. Is it supposed to be a little bit of both? The movie is so contradicting. The only two characters in the film which seemed to represent wisdom and understanding were the mayor and mother-sister. However, the mayor was a drunk who everyone hated and mother-sister was screaming \"burn it down\" during the riot. Also, I thought that the radio dude was supposed to be a good guy as well because of his little speech about love conquering hate. But then he chokes out Sal near the end. Is this film about hypocrites? The scene I dislike the most is when the mentally handicapped guy puts the picture on Sal's wall. What is that action supposed to mean exactly..... the retard is a retard? Redundant! Why would any director do that? Sal can do what he pleases with his wall, It's his wall! That's his individual right. The sequence is given heavy emphasis and seems to be stating that the picture belongs there where that handicapped man put it. In my opinion the only logical conclusion one can come to is that the rioters are purposefully portrayed as heroes after all.Mook obviously did what he thought was the right thing; clearly it wasn't. Most people reason that that's the point, that Mook had a twisted view on things. I disagree, I think Spike Lee was saying that in the end the pizzeria needed to be brought down, and that the crowed did what was righteous and justified. My interpretation of the quotes at the end is that the first quote refers to the barbaric actions of the police, and the second (the quote about self defense) to the demolition of Sal's restaurant. A demolition which in my opinion was completely unwarranted.",

            "content": "Do the Right Thing (1989) **** (out of 4) I'll give my opinions on the controversy and some of George's statements in a bit. As for the film, I personally thought it was brilliantly made. Everything from the dialogue to the direction to the acting is all top-notch. The screenplay just comes off so natural that while you're watching the film you actually think all of the stuff was just coming from the actors on the spot and to me that's the sign of a great screenplay. Even the cinematography was top-notch to the point where you could feel that hot summer day burning you.Now for the controversy. I certainly understand why George and various others called the film's racist but IN THE FILM, the characters are racist but I don't think THE FILM was trying to say that everyone in the world is racist. I think the racism is these characters are not really the people watching the film. It's rather strange because all the racism really took off during the riot scene and some of this might have been done for a message but I think it also took away from some of the characters. The final act of the film really turned into a remake of The Birth of a Nation. In TBOAN, blacks attack whites and the Klan shows up to save the day. In this film, blacks attack whites and the \"Klan\", ala cops and firemen, show up to save the day. People say Griffith showed blacks as animals but what shocked me here is that Spike Lee did the exact same thing here. Throughout the film we see blacks who are either drunks, jobless or racists not doing a thing and then in the end they start a riot. The white characters are all \"workers\" who \"put up\" with blacks but deep down they feel that blacks aren't nothing but the \"N\" word. WTF??? This ending, I feel really took away from the Danny Aiello character. The only white person in a black neighborhood stays in business and is well liked for 25 years yet his racist nature only comes out on this day? Wouldn't they have known this guy was a racist from the start? Then there's the Spike Lee character who works for this white people and tries to \"do the right thing\" by working yet he turns into one of the \"animals\" at the drop of a hat? The only non-racist person in the film just happens to be a drunk so is there some sort of message here? For the sake of an argument I'll say that all the non-racists were at work and Lee just didn't want to show them in the movie. If everyone shown in this film were as racist as we see in the last part then I think that pizza store would have been burned down years earlier. I personally don't feel this neighborhood was nothing but racists but Lee certainly wants us to think that. I think the racist angle was just used at the end to get soem sort of message across, which we get to read in the end with the quotes from King and Malcolm X. These two quotes go against one another so perhaps Lee didn't know what he was trying to get across.In the commentary Lee does bring up some of the controversy and adds some rather interesting comments to the film. He asked why white America was so upset with the pizza joint burning down yet didn't feel anything for the black guy that the cops killed. I would answer Spike that the viewer doesn't need to connect with the person being killed. Do we tell Arnold, Willis or Gibson to just arrest someone and not kill them? If they do kill the bad guys do we question why they did it instead of taking a lesser act? I think the reason people overlooked the killing was because the guy killed was a stereotype bad guy. Lee never took the time to show this guy doing anything except harrassing people so why should we feel anything at the end? On the other side of things, it's rather hard to support the pizza store owner because he just HAD to throw out a racist slur after 25 years. Wouldn't it seem more natural for his older son to shout out this slur since we already knew he was a racist? In the commentary Lee said that Aiello didn't want his character to be racist but Lee forced him to do so. If that one word wasn't said then the white characters couldn't have been racist and there wouldn't have been any question regarding the pizza store vs. the black guy. Throughout the film Lee introduces \"bad characters\" and then, in the end, turns the good characters into bad characters so how are we suppose to feel? As with Crash, I think this type of racism only lives in the screenwriters head. I personally don't see how anyone can look at either of these films (or the Griffith movie) and see any sort of truth. All three films contain stereotypes that lead to controversy but I think the jokes on the viewer because there really shouldn't be any sort of controversy. These films have characters acting racist for entertainment only. I don't see any message in any film and if there are suppose to be messages, then I think only the screenwriter would get them. I understand the word racist being thrown at this film but I think by doing so we're giving Lee too much credit. I'm going to look at these racist characters and events as a form of entertainment. I personally don't live in the world these guys put up on screen so a message isn't going to do me any good.",

They are rewarded by having their pizzeria burned by an angry mob after Sal, the owner, is nice enough to open his place after closing time to let some late arrivals come in for a pie. Sorry folks, Sal and his sons are not representative of \"the Power\" oppressing minority communities. No wonder the film critics and Hollywood celebrities loved his film. It satisfied their innate prejudice for the white working class as the true culprits in racial injustice and racial discord in the country as well as their need to glorify a very mediocre Black director in Spike Lee.

Do the Right Thing is a masterpiece in both style and substance, and Im hard pressed to think of a more powerful, earth-shattering film.But first, let's talk about the style. The color palette of the movie is wonderful; while its mostly deep reds, they manage to bring home the feeling that the residents of Bed-Stuy must have been feeling on that day. The cinematography is excellent... it features a lot of weird viewpoints and angles, but they are used to great effect and manage to work within the style of the film. One thing that really managed to impress me about the film is the razor sharp dialogue... each character has their own style of talking, and it really works well. This is a masterfully written film.\nNow the substance... this movie manages to spiral into a truly spectacular ending. Throughout, its easy to see the necessary elements building, and, when it happens, it hardly seems like a surprise, but that doesn't make it any less shattering. The way that each character acts defines this movie throughout, especially at the end! Spike Lee does a brilliant job here. The movie is interesting and well-made throughout; each of the characters are three-dimensional and feel like real human beings - their motivation is understood throughout. Do the Right Thing is a brilliant movie that never lags and never lets up. It manages to be vastly entertaining and vastly powerful at the same time. It's truly an amazing achievement in film, and its a shame it was not recognized more for its obvious brilliance when it was released in 1989.",

I know that Spike Lee is a rather eccentric personality and is not well liked by everyone, but his films are brilliant and this is no exception.  For about the first two thirds of the movie the plot meanders around a section of New York City as the characters awaken and start their days.  For this first two thirds we have a comedy that is funny because of the eccentric and wonderfully developed characters.  The audience is pulled into the story by the rich dialogue and inventive cinematography.  There is just some quality about this film that makes it seem so real.

I understand that Sal sells pizza in a black neighborhood but that is his restaurant and he gets to choose what to do with it. When the inevitable violence breaks out, I once again believe this was portrayed in the wrong way. Radio and Buggin' Out instigated the whole argument which lead to destruction. This is not a racial tension, that is just pure stupidity and lack of character on their part. Sal did no wrong and ended up paying the price. I also was not a fan of Sal paying Mookie at the end of the film. Mookie smashed Sal's window right in front of him and wanted to be paid for it.

            "content": "I live about two hours away from Seattle, where yesterday some big protest was held over WTO meetings that got so out of hand that police had to use tear gas and such to clear the streets from people who were doing things like smashing windows and vandalising and setting fires. Chances are, I will bet that most of those people have seen and were probably influenced by Do the Right Thing, as were people who caused the LA Riots and probably a lot of other violent protests too. Why? Because to me, this movie sort of gives the impression that that sort of thing is okay to do. Sure, it shows the trouble that people can experience from it(some businesses get ruined and there is a fatality), but it also features the central characters as the ring leaders of the trouble and I don't think these characters are SUPPOSED to be people we don't like or feel for(even though that's what I felt about almost all of them), I think they're supposed to be heroes and \"free spirits\" engaging in obnoxious behavior, which is really sick.\nNever has a movie disgusted or angered me more than this piece of worthlessness, which is most certainly high on my list of worst favorite movies. And this is not simply from the protest at the end either, because I was pretty much feeling that way from after about the first five minutes and on, after being introduced to about my least favorite cast of characters ever. Basically, \"Do the Right Thing\" involves a bunch of young punks. One of them is Mookie, played by director Spike Lee, who works at an Italian pizza place with Sal(Danny Aiello) and his sons(John Turturro plays the more promiment one)and hangs out with fellows like Radio Rasheen, a creepy thug who blasts terrible music from a radio he takes with him everywhere, Smiley, a \"nice\" retarded fellow with an annoying stutter, and Buggin' Out(or something like that) a beyond obnoxious and beyond loathsome fellow who does not like Sal's pizzaria because he only hangs up pictures of white people. Anyway, somewhere along the film, Mookie is told by a gent called Da Mayor(Ossie Davis)who old veteren of the slummy neighborhood he lives in that he needs to \"do the right thing,\" which I guess would mean get his life in gear. That would make it seem like it was going to be some character study completely centering around Mookie, but instead the film primarily focusses on about five different subjects: Mookie and his job at Sal's, Mookie's relationship with his girlfriend(the useless subplot), those terrible friends of Mookie and their crusades around the neighborhood(they try to lobby for that stupid protest and act awful to everyone who passes by), some heat wave(don't ask me why) and racial issues. Race is a very important issue in this film. The cast is mostly portrayed by people in \"minority\" races(African American, Italian American, Korean, Hispanic,etc)and while this could have been a great film about all races learning to accept each other, it instead comes off as a very offensive film about races wanting to stay incredibly exclusive and act hateful to anybody who is not a part of them. It is incredibly ironic that this movie won an award for peace, because the \"right thing\" is engaging in violence and they don't even make the violence look bad. The audience was probably supposed to be all sympathetic when the fire hoses were turned on, but I was so disgusted by the rioting and violence that if those police men had been real I probably would have thanked them or something. I also didn't really mind what they did to Radio Rasheen, though I'm sure I was supposed to.And I can go on and on about my dislike for this film, but it would probably go long over the 1000 word limit, but just trust me, this is one to be avoided because even slightly redeeming factors in this movie(like Ossie Davis's character) get old very quickly. Also, anybody who does not care for profanity in movies will be turned off from this one because their are literally hundreds of swear words and I am not exaggerating. A lousy film on all counts.",

            "content": "It's sometimes difficult to separate artists' public statements from the work they're commenting on, or to ignore the politically charged aura a film generates. There's always that nagging feeling that a movie's point must be sussed out, that the real intentions of the filmmaker must be understood. But in retrospect--and despite director Spike Lee's rhetoric--Do the Right Thing may not be as profound as previously thought. While it should be applauded for taking on the subject of race without Hollywood's usual heavy-handedness, simply presenting a topic doesn't automatically mean anything is actually being said about that topic.Whatever problems there are with the content, Do the Right Thing is still great film-making. It's a vibrant, passionate, funny movie, and like a true work of art, it both surprises and provokes. It's technically audacious and features one of the most successful displays of stifling, suffocating heat ever put on film.and it does it without being languid itself. The dialogue is fast paced, the characters energetic, and the camera-work unpredictable, full of clever pans and Twilight Zone angles. And, except for the always excruciating Martin Lawrence, the performances are uniformly good throughout. Lee also manages to out-Altman Altman by presenting a large cast of characters without it ever becoming confusing or disjointed.Taking place over the course of one scorching day in Bedford-Stuyvesant, most of the action occurs in and around a pizzeria run by Sal (Danny Aiello) and his sons Pino and Vito (John Turturro, Richard Edson). But the entire neighborhood is featured as the film intercuts between various exchanges, many of them tinged with racial overtones: while Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) challenges a white tenement owner when he feels slighted, down the street three men debate the right of a Korean to own a variety store in \"their\" neighborhood.There are personal moments as well: Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) continually attempts to soften Mother Sister's (Ruby Dee) opinion of him, while Mookie (Lee) juggles time between his job at Sal's and his increasingly aggravated girlfriend (Rosie Perez). Although Lee doesn't have the time to make all his characters three-dimensional, he avoids sentimentalizing or demonizing any one group; there are both blacks and whites who are sympathetic (Sal, Da Mayor) and troublesome (Pino, Radio Raheem). Only the Korean storeowner played by Steven Parks is a blatant caricature. (Asians seem to get short shrift no matter who is behind the camera.) Presiding over the action is disc jockey Senor Love Daddy (Samuel L. Jackson). Like Wolfman Jack in American Graffiti, he provides ongoing background music, as well as periodic commentary.Eventually, the heat and personal tensions culminate in an explosion of violence centered on Sal's pizzeria. The violence escalates after one of the characters is killed. It's at this point that the film becomes problematic. The murder is supposed to be a tragedy, meant to provoke outrage in the audience. But the killing of a fictional character isn't enough in itself to warrant a reaction. It's not that audiences are jaded, but drama usually elicits judgement based on the narrative alone. If a character is a jerk, his death won't elicit much of a response. Like Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, Do the Right Thing relies too heavily on the personal baggage audiences are supposedly bringing to the film. Drawing on contemporary events and feelings may be provocative, but it dates the film and makes for poor drama. The reactions of Mookie and Mother Sister to the murder may have been understandable to a disenfranchised group, but in the context of the plot they appear unmotivated, almost random.The somewhat ambiguous nature of the movie could easily be trumpeted as a selling point. Lee doesn't want to hold your hand; he wants you to make up your own mind. But there is a fine line between \"bravely ambiguous\" and \"maddeningly directionless.\" While Oliver Stone continually has been pilloried for his blatantly didactic films, there is something to be said for being recklessly personal and taking a stand. Lee made a movie about racism; but we're so starved for challenging works, for thematically mature movies, we've embraced a film that ultimately says nothing more than \"racism is bad\" and \"no one person or group is to blame.\"The simplistic ideals of Do the Right Thing are most evident in four scenes: 1) Love Daddy lists practically every major black musician from the last fifty years; 2) in an overly contrived sequence, Mookie gets Pino to admit that his cultural heroes are all black (Magic Johnson, Eddie Murphy, and Prince); 3) Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson and Louis Farrakhan are all mentioned; 4) the words \"Tawana Told the Truth\" appear spray painted on a wall (a reference to the Tawana Brawley controversy of 1987). No differentiation is made between the listed artists, and no context is given for the black leaders mentioned. These aren't explorations of racially-charged issues, it's just name dropping.Despite its flaws, Do the Right Thing provokes discussion. It's an impossible film to dismiss. Spike Lee's subsequent career has turned out to be a disappointment, but Do the Right Thing, along with Malcolm X, represent Lee at his creative peak.",

If Raheem killed Sal, which is definitely what he was trying by strangling him, the black community in the film wouldn't have been guilty for his death and say he deserved it.

Rosie Perez is a highlight on the feminine front.\"Do the Right Thing\" was Spike Lee's breakthrough film that he made when he was 31. It's a stylish and spirited account of a mostly black community in New York City that's well-rounded with drama, humor, entertainment, honesty and tragedy.On the one hand, this neighborhood seems like a pleasant enough place to live, if you don't mind the big city. The characters are not painted as one-dimensional, generally speaking; they have both attributes and faults. Yet it's a relatively peaceable environment with the various races/ethnicities getting along just fine with only minor (and amusing) altercations. Nevertheless, it's a tinderbox that doesn't take much to set aflame.The last act leaves a bad taste. I can't believe Lee had the gonads to be this honest, but he shows why most people don't want to live or do business in black neighborhoods, including many blacks.While people debate who's right and who's wrong, it's simple to figure out: Buggin Out taking offense about something immaterial at Sal's pizzeria is unjustified. If he thinks it's that big of a deal he doesn't have to dine there, plus he can start his own restaurant and decorate it however he wishes. At the same time, it could be argued that Sal should've reacted in a wiser way that turned away Buggin Out's curious anger, rather than augment it. Meanwhile Radio Raheem makes a foolish decision by allowing Buggin Out to negatively influence him. Why can't they just do the right thing? It's frustrating.This is a well-made classic and worthy of its iconic status, it's just not exactly my cup of tea due to the exasperating last act that's too brutally honest. How about doing the right thing by making art that inspires hope, unity and healing for inner city communities? This piece points to the problem, inspires questions & debates, but offers no solutions except... move away from black neighborhoods.The film runs 2 hours and was shot in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.GRADE: B-",

These characters include Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) the drunk who constantly tries to win the affection of Mother Sister (Ruby Dee) the neighbourhood matron, and Radio Raheem (Sister Act's Bill Nunn) the young black man who takes his boombox blasting nothing but Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\" (number 40 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), and wears \"love\" and \"hate\" four-fingered rings everywhere he goes. There are also Smiley (Roger Guenveur Smith) the mentally disabled black man preaching the words of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X, fast taking young black man Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) who is demanding Sal puts up black stars on his Wall of Fame, which is covered with Italian Americans, and local disc jockey Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy (Samuel L. Jackson) who watches all the action from his studio. Throughout the film we see the relationships between the black and white characters, the tensions in the community, the amusing activities by those watching others on the street corners, and of course the growing racial arguments in the various areas, whether on the street, in the houses, or in the pizza parlour. Of course the big scene comes at night, when Buggin Out and Radio Raheem join forces to get Sal to put up pictures of \"brothers\" for the Wall of Fame, the argument grows, and Sal loses his temper, using a baseball to destroy Raheem's beloved boombox. This is when the argument escalates, and soon enough the whole neighbourhood joins in the explosive fight, and when the police show up to arrest Raheem, one of them ends up holding him back so strongly, that he is strangled to death. This is when the pizzeria is savagely attacked by the many black people who want justice, and Sal can't do anything but sit back, see his business destroyed and burnt down to the ground. The next day after these shocking events, Mookie demands his last pay for work, Sal fires him, blaming him for beginning the riot, Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy assures the community that things will get back to the way they were, and the final words seen on screen are momentous quotations from Martin Luther King and Malcom X. Also starring White Men Can't Jump's Rosie Perez as Tina, Martin Lawrence as Cee, John Savage as Clifton, Paul Benjamin as ML, Frankie Faison as Coconut Sid, Robin Harris as Sweet Dick Willie, Steve White as Ahmad, Leonard L. Thomas as Punchy and Christa Rivers as Ella. The acting talent of this film, including from then little known stars, like introduced Perez and Lawrence, Lee is fantastic acting and a skilled director, Nunn is great as the boombox clutching cool young man, Turturro gives a good harsh performance, Jackson is superb with his cool fast talking DJ character, and Aiello is a worth Oscar nominee as the pizza restaurant owner with his patience and racial opinion tested constantly. The characters, black and white, are all well thought out, the use of bright sometimes even too bright colours makes for a fantastically distinctive look and feel, the soundtrack is brilliant, and the multi-layered story is really engaging, it is a definite fierce, powerful and must see racial drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Lee, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. It was number 100 on The 100 Greatest Films, and it was number 96 on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies. Very good!",

            "content": "Having read and heard about this controversial Spike Lee joint since it opened, I finally decided to watch it on YouTube just now. What can I say except this was quite an upsetting movie to watch from beginning to end though there are also some funny lines to release the tension and thank goodness both Ossie Davis as Da Mayor and his wife Ruby Dee as Mother Sister were cast in such good parts that were more human and likable than pretty much of the rest of the cast of characters. I mean, Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) deserved what he got when he refused to turn off his boom box but then the white police did get a bit too brutal on him too so what does one do in situations like that? And I've read various reasons why Mookie (Spike's character) pushed that trash can through his employer Sal's (Danny Aiello) window though one has to agree he was definitely in the wrong when he did that. Anyway, good use of both Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\" song (though it was played one too many times) and Spike's father Bill Lee's score with accompaniment of saxophonist Brandford Marsalis. Also good use of Spike's sister Joie as Jade and I liked Rosie Perez' dancing during the beginning credits and choreography though her role of Tina, Mookie's baby's mother leaves a lot to be desired. Oh, and having just watched Samuel L. Jackson as a robber in Coming to America and then as the DJ Love Daddy here provided just how charismatic he could be and would become on screen. So on that note, Do the Right Thing gets a high recommendation with some reservations.",

At most because Sal destroyed the radio it was destruction of property. Radio Raheem tried to strangle Sal. Yes it was sad when the police accidentally killed him but he would not calm down and continued to fight them. Mookie had no respect for Sal, the person who employed him and gave him a job. He took forever on deliveries, saw other people and took showers even though he still was on the clock and got paid. He threw the garbage can through the window which inevitably ended in the pizzeria to get destroyed and came back in the end for his money. That shows no respect.Tolerance?

            "content": "Spike Lee's DO THE RIGHT THING is one of the most vibrant, upbeat tragedies of the American cinema. Set in a small neighborhood in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvescant region, it's the story of the various people that inhabit the block as they try to live and work under a palpable air of racial tension, culminating in a tragic and thought-provoking climax that is still widely debated. Mookie (Spike Lee) is ostensibly the main character in a rich ensemble cast. He's a pizza delivery boy for Sal's Famous Pizzeria, a local institution run by the good-hearted Sal (Danny Aiello) and his two sons, the racist Pino (John Turturro) and the quiet and sweet-natured Vito (Richard Edson). Also living on the block is the drunken sage Da Mayor (Ossie Davis), the all-seeing Mother Sister (Ruby Dee), the local DJ Senor Love Daddy (Samuel L. Jackson), Mookie's sister Jade (Joie Lee) and his girlfriend Tina (Rosie Perez). These characters are brought vividly to life by an amazing cast, and the entire film is filled with loud, boisterous dialogue and music, and the neighborhood itself is presented in bright, ostentatious neon colors. All of these work to both offset and accentuate the senseless tragedy that the day's end will bring.It's a record heat wave day, and trouble starts to brew when Mookie's hot-headed friend Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) angrily notices that the Wall of Fame in Sal's is decorated only with pictures of successful Italian Americans, and no black people. Buggin' tries to get the neighborhood to boycott Sal's, but most refuse, because Sal's has been in the neighborhood for 25 years and many of the inhabitants grew up on his pizza. Buggin' finally gets the hulking Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) to join his cause, because Sal treated him rudely earlier when Radio refused to turn down the boombox he blasts twenty-four-seven. Words are exchanged, the boombox is smashed, and a riot ensues. Radio is killed by the police, and Mookie throws a trash can through the window of the pizzeria, which is eventually burned to the ground. The biggest question most viewers will be left with is why. Why would Mookie throw the trashcan, after Sal just said that he considered Mookie to be like a son to him? Was it because of Sal's affection for Jade? Was it the death of Radio Raheem? Was it because he truly believed that Sal was wrong in his actions and that the place needed to be destroyed? Or is it simply because Mookie is drifting through his life, and suddenly sees the opportunity to do something important? Why couldn't Buggin' Out have behaved less antagonistically about the pictures? Why couldn't Sal, whose client\u00e8le is almost completely black, just have put some pictures of black people up? Lee offers no answers to any of these questions, because answering these would be deciphering human nature. The film is about ignorance in every community, and how people are too proud or too stubborn to speak out there differences and come to rational conclusions. The destruction of Sal's didn't bring Radio Raheem back to life. It didn't even make anyone feel better about the loss. But it was done in the heat of anger and it can't be taken back. The biggest tragedy for the viewer is that we all know what could have been done to prevent everything, but we also know that given the same opportunities over again, no one would have behaved differently.",

It all begins on the hottest day of summer in a borough of New York. African-American Mookie (director Spike Lee) works at Sal's (Danny Aiello) pizzeria. As Sal and his sons are proud of their Italian heritage, they decorate the store with pictures of Italian-Americans. But Mookie's friend Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) notes that the pizzeria's only patrons are black, so Sal should put up pictures of African-Americans. When Sal refuses, Buggin Out announces a boycott. From there...well, you have to see the movie to really understand it. John Turturro, Bill Nunn, Ossie Davis, and Ruby Dee all provide great support. All in all, this was probably Spike Lee's second best movie behind \"Malcolm X\", and this appears to be where he began his tradition of portraying Italians negatively (continued in \"Jungle Fever\" and the under-appreciated \"Summmer of Sam\").",

In other words, conflicts arise and gaps begin to build where they would not have to be. But that would be a perfect world wouldn't it?

And it is not an easy or straightforward path as the quotes at the end of the movie suggest. What makes this movie so good, is that you can draw your own conclusions and judgement of what you think makes sense. One thing is for sure: as is evident, the status quo was not helping anyone ... and unfortunately, certain things still occur (a very eerie scene with a police encounter towards the end of the movie is testament to that).Not an easy movie to watch by any standards or definition, but a very well made one, that touches a lot of social issues in the city Spike Lee loves so much (but can be applied to other cities and countries) ...",

Lee describes his characters with either an ounce of irony, either an ounce of tenderness.What makes the main strength of the movie is that the director goes with ease from comedy to drama. Indeed, the beginning of the film leads to expect a normal and trite day. But, gradually, tensions between communities rise and an incident is sufficient to spark off a riot. From this moment, this is a realistic and down-to-earth vision that Spike Lee suggests us and wants to underline the fact that racism, nowadays, ranks among the major problems in the USA and this problem is far from being solved. In this way, you can consider the characters of \"Smiley\" and \"\"Radio Raheem\" as a clumsy attempt to demand more rights and tolerance towards black people.\"Do the right thing\" is probably Spike Lee's most accomplished movie and one of the finest movies devoted to racism.",

Spike Lee has remarked over the years that while the white establishment has been comfortable supporting comedy with a cast of black actors it has been less willing to embrace drama, especially if it might stir anger and undo the carefully spun version of American History. Some of Spike Lee's films have a tragic ending that might seem like last-minute manipulation. Bamboozled comes to mind. School Daze has a blatant \"Wake up!\" message to camera, and Jungle Fever has an unintentionally funny solicitation and reaction of shock. Of the films that Spike Lee has written and directed, Do the Right Thing is the most perfectly woven story combined with aesthetic. He and Ernest Dickerson have made a visually cohesive and involving film that holds up enough that you will forget people are not carrying smart phones. We might be left debating among ourselves as to what right thing must be done, which is just as well. As an over-simplification from \"The Mayor,\" the credo is politely received by Mookie. In the aftermath of the movie's events, there may be people who claim the right thing to do was for the white man, Sal, to include black celebrity photos on the wall of his pizzeria among all the Italians he personally admires being a middle-aged Italian. The place is a little embassy of his own identity in the middle of predominantly black Bed Sty where it has been in business for decades. Despite eating there since childhood, Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) does a double-take one day while having a slice. Only then does he develop sudden and fresh outrage over the lack of black faces on Sal's wall. This is a debate that extends to diversity issues and OscarSoWhite, but we'll take it at face value. Should Sal have caved in to Buggin' Out's demand and eventually let him curate all of the photos on the wall of fame to ensure that there is a higher black to Italian ratio closer to that of the neighbourhood, or was Sal right to see Buggin' Out as a hothead and hang on to his own territory? People on-line have examined the continuity of a scene with white neighbour's/cyclist John Savage being accused of scuffing Buggin' Out's running shoe with his bike tire. The question of which shoe could have been run over doesn't add up, and the implication is that Buggin' Out is unjust and looking for issues to rage over. Buggin' Out ropes in the mild-mannered Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) who just wants to walk around listening to his ghetto blaster. Buggin' Out is trying to boycott Sal's place. He radicalizes Raheem. They show up just after the restaurant closes and beg for Sal to open ostensibly for just one more slice, clearly gaining access only to protest the place and confront Sal. Raheem blasts his music at the counter and refuses Sal's request to turn it down. The young men won't leave and won't turn off the music. Sal finally picks up a baseball bat and smashes the radio. Raheem is then driven mad by the loss of his property and begins to fight the older man. The fight spills into the street. The police see the huge and powerful physicality of Raheem and intervene. They over-compensate for the strength of Raheem by putting him in a notorious choke hold he sadly does not survive. This happening to Raheem then finally radicalizes the calm and reasonable, neutral Mookie who throws a trash can into the restaurant window and starts a riot. In the chaos that follows, Buggin' Out is somewhat part of the background and nobody notices a mentally challenged man wander off to start a fire and burn down the place; we see Italian celebrities on the wall of fame consumed by fire but also a picture the arsonist has left behind in the wreckage to also burn up - that of Martin Luthor King and Malcolm X shaking hands. Whether someone respected Frank Sinatra or MLK, their photos burned the same. The fire doesn't discriminate. Lee had said in commentaries that white viewers came away talking about loss of property (the restaurant, as opposed to the radio), and black viewers tended to focus on loss of life. But considering that police only appear in a couple of scenes and are not central to the spine of the film, it seems clear that whether intended or not Buggin' Out is the one to blame for the death of Radio Raheem. Had he not presumed to be territorial with Sal and attempt to boycott a business his friend Mookie works for, and had he not been single-minded and impatient (the way Twitter and blogger campaigns are today) without regard for Sal's right to self-determination in his own shop, the dominoes of violence would not have fallen. He drew Raheem into a bad position and exploited him as muscle. They knew Sal to be a take-no-crap kind of guy and an adult and obviously tough enough to be a white businessman in Harlem, and yet Buggin' Out coaxed Raheem into intimidating and trespassing. The police were careless in arresting Raheem and should have been more attentive. They were professionals responsible for protecting life, no question. But the events that got them there were mostly if not entirely on the shoulders of Buggin' Out. Not only on race but on various progressive issues, there are many perhaps well-meaning or just high-on-ideals internet activists who are more like Buggin' Out then they realize. Years later, Spike Lee revisited the role of Mookie in his fifties for a film called Red Hook Summer. Mookie was still delivering pizza for Sal. Ultimately, it is not about Sal. We never do see what is on the more current walls of his new place, but it is also none of our business.",

Maybe if this guy had something to do, maybe he wouldn't think like this. But really, who cares about pictures on the wall? Why would anyone want pictures of black people on the wall when he comes into an Italian pizzeria? But that's just for starters, folks. We've got another guy who walks around the neighborhood playing the same song looking mean, having zero respect for anyone who's not black, looking for trouble and finally getting it. Again, give this guy a job. Finally, we've got a poor employee (at best, a fair employee) of the pizzeria who decides to incite a riot against his own place of employment! (Yes, we should hire more black guys like that) Why did he do it, because his friend found the trouble he seemed so desperately in search of. Now, to respond to the person below who thought this was a valid thing to do, I'd say that's nonsense! What did Sal's Pizzeria have to with the guy getting killed? Nothing. He came into the pizzeria looking for trouble, and he got it. Simple. It's his own fault he's dead. With his attitude, this guy had the life-expectancy of about 2 minutes. Besides, why would an employee throw a trash can through his own place of employment? Obviously, this film revolted me, and I have nothing but contempt for it, but I'd have to say the scene when the black people riot, was so disturbing, I found it difficult to watch. How could anyone offer any praise for this film after seeing that? How can anyone watch that?! And then you've got the catalyst, Mookie, the lousy employee returning to the scene of his crime. Why you may ask? For his pay! Yeah Sal, I started a riot, and helped burn down your pizzeria. Now I needs to get paid.I find it very puzzling, to say the least, that a black man would write, and direct a film like this. He made the main black characters look like simple minded idiots!

It's the hottest day of summer, but we know this even without the in-world references and the narration of radio jockey Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy. His palette is awash with 'hot' colours that perfectly capture the heat of the setting; reds, oranges, yellows that boil under the surface and seep through the screen until racial tensions that have been harboured for years explode into focus. There is a montage that bursts with this anger; later used again in Lee's 25th Hour. When Radio Raheem strides into Sal's blasting Fight the Power, he demands a slice of pizza and is shot with a wide lens, which distorts his face and makes it loom large in the frame, towering over the POV recipient. This is relevant to Sal, but also to Pino, who is quite sure of his racist views. This is a canvas full of characters that pop out at you. Their skin shines with sweat and the words that comes out of their mouths resemble authenticity; why else would we be so frustrated with an act of simply buying radio batteries, or how irresponsible Mookie becomes in both his job and his love life? These are flawed characters, and Lee spends much of his time devoted to criticising them, not outright, but by showing who they are and prompting us to understand. Sal is proud that he has raised this street on his pizza, and berates Pino for being outwardly racist, then in a fit of anger smashes a black man's property who has come barging into his pizzeria demanding 'justice'. In another burst of anger, Radio Raheem chokes out the man who has destroyed his one treasured possession, and we understand his rage, but not necessarily how he goes about dishing it out. Anger and the heat drives these people to do these things. Some interpretations have said that Mookie redirects the mob rage to property instead of Sal - the right thing. No, he is angry, angry that love has lost out to hate, that a brother has been killed, and of course that emotion boils over in him too, and he must take action.Later he returns to ask for what he is due - his salary - and we see now that he his hostility is not aimed at Sal at all, or his pizzeria. People have endlessly pondered on what is the right thing to do in this film. There are no easy answers. A community has lost a brother in an act of brutality, perhaps not purposely in the haze of rioting and violence. The riot is not the right thing in the sense that they destroy Sal's beloved pizzeria, and they even nearly veer towards the Korean grocery in their anger. In a different sense, it is an act that cries out loudly from the oppressed. Sal's pizzeria will rise again - he has his insurance, and his mutual relationship with his customers. But Radio Raheem is dead, and will remain dead, and there must be a response. That response is directed towards the window, and oh it's heartbreaking to see his life's work go up in flames, but where is the heartbreak for Raheem's radio, a piece of property in itself? Or more importantly, his life? It would have been very easy for Lee to tilt the scales. But he doesn't; when the white copes arrive in the wake of a prank that leaves a man and his car soaked, they brush it off. Da Mayor is a small voice of reason that perhaps does the only righteous things in saving a little boy and trying in vain to reason with the riot. No one but Raheem and Smiley even agree with Buggin Out's boycott; they've been raised on this pizza after all, and though they prop up Sal with their business, it is a two way street, with it being the only place along with the Korean grocer where food is available. But they riot with him anyway. Why is that? It is a significantly more important question than, why did they riot at all? And then there is love between the lines. Watch how Mookie quietly seduces Tina with a block of ice, as he skips out on his work. See how Sal treats Jade with respect and care, even as both his son and her brother observe with disapproval (maybe even disgust in Pino). They see eye to eye on this particular issue, but unfortunately on opposite sides. Da Mayor seeks romance with Mother Sister, who is wary of his drunkenness, but also wise in recognising his kindness and goodness. But then in climax, she too is shouting for the pizzeria to be burnt down. Tricky. Lee ends with two conflicting perspectives from MLK and Malcolm X, but which seem to fit together. Oh, this form of protest is violent and impractical and immoral, but what are the residents of Bedford-Stuyvesant supposed to do in the wake of a brother's death? And then you can condemn them too, and go on forever arguing. But at least we are arguing about it. We need to be.Film Crit Hulk offers some enlightenment. He ponders that people still ask why Mookie smashed Sal's window, but not why the police killed Radio Raheem. It is something to consider. People say, why couldn't have Raheem just turned off his music, but those same do not say, why could Sal not have referred to it as 'jungle music'? The latter seems to be reasonable (Even I wrestled with it upon my first watch), but again, we filter the events. He eloquently sums up this film better than I could in one sentence: It's impossible to do the right thing when no one seems to care when the wrong things are done to you.",

I'm really glad I did because no matter what your take, you can't help but weigh in on it. And I think that's the point. The issues of racism and poverty are way too complex to begin to present in a film. The director creates a group of interesting characters, appropriate to the setting (an extremely hot day in Bedford-Stuyvesant) and then simply takes a step back and watches what happens. I didn't feel hatred toward anyone (except maybe some of the cops) because most days there is a symbiosis (harsh as it may be) that allows them to get from one day to the next. People complain about the language, but it has to be there to recreate the hopelessness of this place. Excellent acting and a real groundbreaking film.",

So far, Do the Right Thing is his best film.Do the Right Thing takes place on the hottest day of the year in a Brooklyn neighbourhood and shows its residents as tensions being to mount when the day goes on.I've seen this film a few times and it still has the same effect on me. Being his second feature film, Lee accomplishes so much with film in terms of its themes, characters and style. Working with cinematographer Ernest Dickerson, Lee really managed to emphasise the hotness of the day. The colour palette is filled with reds and oranges to convey the high temperature and characters are constantly seen sweating to reinforce that aspect. It works so well as the day gets hotter, the tension and conflict begins to rise leading to one of the most explosive third acts in a movie. The film is impeccably shot. Spike Lee brings a lot of style to the way its shot. The close-ups and dutch angles give us so much insight into the nature of the neighbourhood as well up the intensity and anger present in the characters.Speaking of characters, I love all of them. The film doesn't necessarily have an actual story. It focuses on different characters of different races. All of them are incredibly watchable and interesting. Spike Lee gives each character something that makes them distinct. I don't think I'll forget characters like Radio Raheem, Buggin Out, Sal, Da Mayor and Mookie. All the actors involved do a phenomenal job here. Danny Aiello, Bill Nunn, Spike Lee, Giancarlo Esposito, John Turturro and Ossie Davis are fantastic. I, however, wish the female characters had more to work with.What really makes Do the Right Thing special is its meaning and themes. Lee loves to explore race in his films and Do the Right Thing is no different. I couldn't believe the third act of this film. It completely shocked me at how relevant it is to this day. It's sad to see issues like racial tension and police brutality still be around in 2020 when Lee showed us this over thirty years ago. It's a very disheartening but powerful ending that makes you wonder how this going to be solved and what exactly is the 'right thing' to do.Do the Right Thing is a very important and powerful film. It's expertly crafted with incredibly well written and memorable characters that eventually leads to one of the most impactful and relevant endings to a movie ever. Do the Right Thing is a must watch!",

            "content": "One hot day in Brooklyn turns the racial tension that has been building up in the small neighborhood to a full boil after an incident involving one of the residents, and it culminates in a highly fist-wrenching climax. As you can tell by the afterword of the film, this is a movie that seeks to reconcile the teachings of two of the Civil Rights movement's most prominent voices--Dr. Martin Luther King and Malcom X, the former having taught standing up for your rights via civil disobedience and nonviolence, while Malcom X urged that your rights are something you have to declare yourself and actively defend in that 'By Any Means Necessary' activist manner.This was, for me, one of the best movies of the decade and one of the best Spike Lee movies I have seen yet. The cast, too, is phenomenal, featuring Danny Aiello, Richard Edson and John Tuturo as an Italian family of father and sons who own the neighborhood pizza place. Spike Lee plays the sort of neutral force, the go-between. The cast also features Rosie Perez, Giancarlo Esposito (as a sort of instigator), Samuel L. Jackson, Robin Harris (Bebe's Kids), and most importantly, husband and wife civil rights activist team, Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee as feuding (and courting) neighbors who represent the elders perspective.

            "content": "Let's take a little time on director's ambitions. Not all, but some of the most important directors in the business, are ambitious. They are always seeking beyond the images of their films, with a personal message the viewer don't always gets to appreciate. It happens more with writer/directors. Paul Thomas Anderson has been pursuing, I believe, the sadness of human reality, in all its aspects. In other cases, with directors but not writers, like Martin Scorsese; who puts something about his own life in each piece he directs. Writer/director Spike Lee generated the controversy that he would generate periodically years later when he released \"Do the right thing\". What does Spike Lee pursues? The fairness for his people: African-American, black people. As in many other movies, he proved that right with \"Do the right thing\".Lee invites the audience to a typical day in Brooklyn. Right there, we listen to rap music, saying \"fight the power\"; and when we see Spike Lee in his character Mookie, we know there's something about Lee's life. And we realize the film is his when we meet his realism, his characters and his (I wanted to arrive here) ambitions. We listen to Mister Senor Love Daddy (an over top, outrageously funny Sam Jackson) saying good morning from his radio station: \"And that's the truth, Ruth\". It's a sunny day; Mookie goes to work and bumps into a lot of people: Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) and his friends Cee (Martin Lawrence), Punchy (Leonard Thomas) and other girls, the retarded Smiley (Roger Smith) Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) attempting to conquest Mother Sister's (Ruby Dee) heart, Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) spreading style all over, Tina (Rosie Perez) waiting for his man, three old men sitting in the street talking about life\u0085This is black territory all the way through.But there's also \"Sal's (Danny Aiello) Famous Pizza\", hated by his son Pino (John Turturro), who works there with his other brother Vito (Richard Edson), but loved by the entire neighborhood. The place has been there for over twenty years and the pizza is good; Mookie works there. But are these people black? Oh no, they're white Italians, with pictures of their white heroes in the walls of their place. So, when it seems like a common day, Spike Lee gets quietly to his objections. With his script, in which every character gets a chance to shine, he develops little things that you will find interesting and revealing. Buggin Out, the movie's craziest character, is the guy with the racist problems. This is not a movie where black hate white and vice versa. I mean, it's not like they love each other, but there's respect. The thing is that the characters are so marked by racism that they dislike the situation of being in the same environment the people of other color are. \"I detest this place\", says Pino.Buggin Out has a problem with a white guy, when his new shoes are stepped by the guy. Buggin gets angry and asks what he's doing on \"his\" neighborhood, on \"his\" block on \"his\" side of the street. \"I own this place\", the guy answers. Then Buggin says: \"Why do you wanna live in a black neighborhood?\", Buggin asks angrily, referring to Brooklyn. \"I was born in Brooklyn\", the guy concludes. Buggin and his friends start shouting, and they can't understand that the guy was born there, because they are used to be among blacks and not among whites; but that's not hate. Anyway, that's the same Buggin that tells Mookie: \"Stay black\"; because Mookie works with white people. A white man passes by with his old car, when Cee and company are playing with water. \"Don't throw water into my car\", he says. They do it, and laugh hard. The cops are also white, but they can't do anything to Cee and his friends, they were having fun and there's respect.All of this characters are controlled by Lee, you can tell; even when he's also acting on screen. There's no doubt he knows that world more than anyone and how he wants to present it is very important. Like in \"25th Hour\", he moves his camera all around with his personal style, and puts his characters talking facing the camera directly. They start to say things, about other people and about themselves sometimes. In \"25th Hour\", the speakers where, black, white, Chinese, Korean, Latin American\u0085Anything you could imagine, because it was a whole city. Before, in \"Do the right thing\", it was just a block, and the speakers where the people that lived there. It's amazing how Lee does it; the words he write and the characters stop talking but you know they have much more to say they could go on. You know Spike Lee has so much to say.Going back to the story; Lee puts some clues to the incredibly unexpected conclusion. When Da Mayor tells Mookie: \"Always, always do the right thing\", and Buggin tells Sal that he is planning to boycott his place\u0085You feel something; like the way I felt as I watched \"It's the rage\". Something like a downfall\u0085A collapse. This is a very good movie, and I wasn't trying to interpret its conclusion, because I know how important a director's ambition is. So, when the screen goes black, and you read the words said by those black legends, you can only guess that everyone was just trying to do the right thing.",

It explores the issue of racism in a powerful and brutal way, showing how every character has their own prejudices, and how some characters are far more villainous and hateful than others. Eventually, this hatred explodes into a finale that can only be described as shocking and chaotic.For a large portion of the film, I was smiling and laughing at all of the joyfulness and comedy that is packed into this somewhat depressing story. Although it's about a strong and mature topic, the film itself is entertaining, hilarious, and likable. But, it's still a very heavy film at times as well.Spike Lee portrays racism in a very powerful and meaningful way, and he doesn't just show whites oppressing blacks, which is refreshing to see, since it's a clich\u00e9 in a film about race to show that all of the black characters are saints who don't have prejudices of their own. Pretty much every main character in \"Do the Right Thing\" has their own prejudice, some of them have far more mild prejudices than others, and some of them are far more kind than others. Characters like Radio Raheem and (especially) Buggin' Out are very hateful against the whites, and then characters like Pino are very hateful against the blacks. There's also characters who hold strong prejudices against Asian characters, and elderly characters. Overall, the film shows that hate can be inside of anybody, and can be directed to anybody.Unfortunately, it seems like many people seem to be interrupting the film all wrong. Looking through message boards and reviews, some people may have the idea that \"Do the Right Thing\" supports the actions of Radio Raheem and Buggin' Out, but they're wrong. Based on the film I watched, the Italian pizzeria owner Sal is actually supposed to be somewhat likable. He cares for and likes his customers, unlike his son Pino, a very racist and unsympathetic character, and Pino comes across as the polar opposite as his very likable and friendly brother Vito. Sadly, Sal unleashes all of his hatred at the end of the film, when Buggin' Out and Radio Raheem unleash their own hatred. Mookie, a very likable black character, is also pushed to the limit at the end of the film. So both Sal and Mookie are good people who are pushed to their limit and unleash hatred, while characters like Da Mayor and Vito are never really filled with hate and remain likable for the entirety of the film, and other characters like Buggin' Out and Pino are very racist and unlikable for the entirety of the film.At least, this is how I interpreted the film.",

I knew that to some the catalyst for the events in the film were essentially the swelling heat and the rising racial tensions. But I also know that if you really wanted to, you could make a case for the catalyst for the tragic events in the movie being the fact that there are no pictures of black people on the wall of the local pizzeria in the movie. Knowing that, that is why I avoided the film for as long as I did. Having watched the film finally, I have to agree, that that really is the catalyst for the events in the movie and it really made me wish I avoided the film for possibly even longer than I did because it just makes the entire movie silly. Let me explain...Think about it this way: how silly would it be for me to storm the local Thai restaurant near my house (while I crank a boom-box at full-volume like Raheem does in the movie) while exclaiming, \"What's with all of these pictures of Bhumibol Adulyadej on the wall? And who are these other Thai people? Ain't no Thai people in this neighborhood: we got black and white people here, and I ain't see none of them on your wall! I put 'much money' into this place!\"--It'd be incredibly ludicrous, right? Look, when I've gone into pizzerias, it doesn't matter what the predominate ethnicity might be in that location of said pizzeria, I'm going to expect to see pictures of Italian people on the walls, or cheesy/hokey murals of Rome, and so on. When I eat at a place that serves ethnic food (or at least food with ethnic overtones), I am not going to expect the place to bend and shape to the ethnicity of the neighborhood it's located in or of myself. Why?--Because that would be stupid.But if I nit-picked on all of the \"silliness\" of the content within Do The Right Thing, I could be writing for forever. Most people's reviews focus on the content of the film, not the form/craft, so I'm going to make an effort to focus on the latter as much as possible.Over the film classes I've taken and the books I've read on film, Do The Right Thing has been brought up constantly (and always with high regard). Now actually seeing the movie left me surprised of this, for Do The Right Thing is not a well-made movie. The directing is surprisingly inept, the cinematography is overrated, the acting from the majority of the characters in the film is laughable and unbelievable, the script is flimsy, and the dialogue is utterly groan-worthy.Speaking of groaning, anytime where there is a scene that they decide to use the incidental music composed for the movie (which is probably about five times during the course of the movie, and often if the scene involves either or both ML and Mother Sister) I dare you to try not to groan. Suddenly the film drastically and abruptly changes from a \"slick and hip\" time-capsule of 1989 to a full-on laughable amateur high-school-produced melodrama. When the syrupy incidental music kicks in with Branford Marsalis' saxophone, and ML asks, \"Is the neighborhood still standing?\" To which Mother Sister replies, \"We're still standing,\" with a straight-face--yeah, I think I punched myself in the face.One of the biggest annoyances with Do The Right Thing are the constant Dutch angles. See, one would commonly employ a Dutch angle if one wanted to suggest tension, and sure there is that in the movie, but often a Dutch angle is used within Do The Right Thing when people are talking calmly and about nothing at all rendering the angle meaningless when it is constantly used. If the constant Dutch angles were meant to suggest alienation (as they are used for in The Third Man), really they were not used well to even suggest that effect (if that was indeed the desire of Spike Lee, and I don't believe it was, I am just blindly groping for explanations). Seriously, the Dutch angles were in such high use I might as well have been watching an episode of the campy 1960s Batman television show.A lot of people have praised the cinematography in the film; but seriously, check out almost any David Lean film if you want to see good cinematography (especially his criminally under-watched adaptations of Oliver Twist and Great Expectations). Check out Ford's Grapes of Wrath, or any Kubrick or Renoir, and so on. Oh, and yes, almost every film textbook I ever had praised the originality of how Spike Lee used a color palette primarily consisting of reds, yellows and oranges to help communicate the heat. Really? I am confused as to why people act as though Spike Lee was original in doing such a thing. Since technicolor first came about, directors and cinematographers used the same trick to communicate heat or cold, and even before that during the silent-film era, they used to tint the film of certain scenes different colors to suggest heat or cold (or night or day, as well as other things).I could go on and on, but I have written too much already (IMDB has a 1000 word limit). As I watched the film, my opinion of it steadily declined. But I think when Radio Raheem made his awkward reference to Night of The Hunter--that is when my opinion of the film truly plummeted. I have a rule: Don't remind me of a good movie during your bad movie, because you just make me want to watch that said good movie instead of your piece of steaming crap (example: Kill Bill referencing Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia, Fever Pitch referencing Annie Hall, Cocktail featuring Casablanca, and so on).",

It is an at times psychedelic headf*ck, a mish-mash of random movement and broadly drawn caricatures of various generations, backgrounds and ethnicities.As we are told all too many times the film takes place on an especially hot day in New York as a bright colourful array of broadly drawn characters go about their everyday business. For many that's simply hanging on street corners commenting on passers by, for the homeless man known as the Mayor (Ossie Davis) that means cadging enough cash to buy a beer, for various shop keepers that means running a business where the clientele openly resent them \u2013 or at least their background.Most notably this includes Sal's pizzeria where the aforementioned Sal (Danny Aiello), his two sons Vito (Richard Edson) and Pino (John Turturro), and delivery boy Mookie (Spike Lee). (As something to do with nothing our family dog is named Mookie, though not for this film, for ex-Atlanta Hawks PG Mookie Blaylock.)As the day progresses and the temperature soars the normally barely convivial relationships between neighbours and acquaintances fray, with tempers simmering in the heat. It seems that people of every ethnicity have issues with those of other races and religions, and that on this particular day hiding these resentments and opinions is not high on the priorities list.In the middle of all this is Sal's, a pizzeria in a predominantly black community with a black clientele that proudly hangs numerous pictures of Italian-Americans on its walls. Son Pino openly resents both his situation and customers, Mookie wants to hold onto his job but is constantly having his patience tested by Pino's poking and prodding, and Sal is proud of his business and standing in the community, and seems to genuinely not see things as being defined by colour or race.There are a lot of subplots and peripheral characters in Do the Right Thing who serve little other purpose but to show the extent of the melting pot, to keep the blood pumping and the film moving at 100 mph, eventually though many of these characters converge on Sal's at almost the same time, and the tense interactions and stress of the day all come to a head.I won't betray the ending of the film here, especially given that it is really the only major plot development in a film which up to that point was all build up putting several characters on an inevitable collision course.The film is exceptionally edited to remain in perpetual motion, a blur of vivid colour, profane dialogue and loud conversations and rants peppered with casual (and sometimes inferred) racism.Danny Aiello and John Turturro both have very brave performances, and I say that realising that 'brave' is a descriptor used all too frequently in film, but here it couldn't be more apt.Equally brave and amazing is the writing and directing job done by Knick fan #1, Mr Spike Lee, here still a scrawny chicken legged kid, and realistically one who some twenty years later has still not topped this film.I wonder if two decades on Spike/Mookie would make the same decisions and take the same actions if faced with a similar situation he did in 1989. Actually my main hope is that the casual racism and resentment has somewhat abated from the levels shown in this film, and far more clumsy lesser films such as Crash.And if you have to have one song played about 237 times in a film, I'm just glad it was Public Enemy's 'Fight the Power', and not a million other crappy songs.Final Rating \u2013 8.5 / 10. Do the Right Thing might not be the most subtle film to deal with the topic, unfortunately it might be the most honest.",

            "content": "Okay, time has reduced the music to an embarrassing joke, at least that of Public Enemy, but Do The Right Thing still retains its meaning. Luckily Bob Marley and Spike Lee's father contribute some quality music to the film. Do The Right Thing is a tremendous achievement from Spike Lee that boldly approaches the white-hot subjects of race and class relations and leaves us with an ambiguous but hugely effective ending. The film starts off with the horrifyingly annoying newcomer Rosie Perez on a soundstage with a rotating background of what appears to be Lee's ideal neighborhood, engaging in some sort of nutty activity that must have at one time vaguely resembled dancing.\n(spoilers) The entire movie takes place over the course of one tremendously hot day in Brooklyn, in which the neighborhood's racial tensions build up and build up and ultimately explode in a riot that results in the total destruction of a beloved pizzeria and the death of one of the neighborhood youths. The film contains a surprising array of very colorful (no pun intended) characters, and the narrative structure moves along at a realistic pace but is able to keep your attention throughout the film. The film successfully manages several different storylines that all take place simultaneously and all add to the escalation of racial conflict that explodes at the end of the film. We see Sal, the owner of the town's pizzeria, and his sons as they interact with the residents of the inner city neighborhood in which the pizzeria operates and where they never fully feel that they belong. They are racial outsiders, but the have run a good business for years in the community which seems to be Lee's effort to prove that racially different people can live together happily. John Turturro is excellent as Pino, Sal's older son who is the less tolerant one towards the black people in the neighborhood. One of the more interesting about the movie is the title. After watching it, it seems that the right thing that the title refers to is the single act of Mookie throwing that trash can through the front window of Sal's Pizzeria at the end of the film. It seems like this is an vicious act against Sal's business, but you have to keep in mind the scene up to that point. Sal and his sons were cornered in front of the store by a mob angered by the death of Radio Raheem, one of the town's charming youths, and Mookie knows that the three of them are in danger. When he threw the can through the window, he took the mob's anger and redirected from Sal and his sons and onto the store. He probably saved their lives. There was clearly something right about that initially questionable thing that Mookie did.There is obviously going to be a lot of controversy about a movie like this because it deals with the hotly debated issue of racial relations, but you really have to analyze it before you can make any accusations, because it is a very complex film. Spike Lee manages to create a movie that starts off with almost endlessly entertaining comedy but ultimately winds up as a tremendously powerful and moving film, a technique hardly ever seen, but when it's done right, as is the case here and in other films like Life Is Beautiful, the result is that much more effective.",

But Spike Lee needs to be called on what he's gotten away with so far. Lee \"borrowed\" a device used by Laughton in \"Night of the Hunter\"-the tattoed fingers spelling \"love\" on one hand and \"hate\" on the other for his character Radio Raheem. In \"NOTH\" this was used to signify the duality of the Robert Mitchum character, as well as tip the audience off that he's a raging psychopath. What's Lee doing with it here-he never implies that Raheem is dangerous and unstable. In fact, Raheem remains a cipher-we don't know much about him because the director is using him the same way characters are used in splatter movies-a device to advance the plot. But the really offensive part of the movie is near the end, when Sal (Danny Aiello) is shown brandishing an emormous wad of money, suggesting that he is gouging his customers and helping to justify their antagonism toward him. Unless he's charging about $600 per pizza or running drugs, he could NEVER have amassed that much money in one day. But we are never shown or told of any such occurances-it's a cheap shot, plain and simple. Spike Lee fell into a trap which awaits most zealots-he has become what he hates.

            "content": "Do the Right Thing is Spike Lee's breakout classic film set in Brooklyn. Over his career many of his films are hit and miss, but this is by far his best. Set in Brooklyn on \"the hottest day of the year\", it has an all-star cast including the director himself, John Turturro, Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Rosie Perez, John Savage, and many others. The film takes place in the universe of a Brooklyn neighborhood where the theme of race is played out with some great satire as well as depth. It definitely captured the moment of 1980s New York. Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn who passed away recently), was a great segue between scenes as he carries his 20 battery boom box through town. Fight the Power by Public Enemy was the apropos theme song (don't believe the hype; Elvis, contrary to the lyrics was NOT racist). But there is also some well orchestrated film background music to fill out the soundscape, as well as Samuel L. Jackson as Love Daddy, the local DJ. It's great how everyone in the neighborhood seems to know each other and it all comes together with the segue characters connecting Mookie (Lee) with his pizza delivery scenes. Ossie Davis plays the \"Mayor\" and is the town drunk, but also the wise elder who ominously and understatedly tells Mookie to \"always do the right thing\" (reminds one of how George Kennedy whispers \"cool hand Luke\" in that great film). Radio Raheem has a classic \"love and hate\" scene which revamps the Robert Mitchum Night of the Hunter concept (in this case he has gold knuckles). John Savage has a cameo (I thought it was Tim Robbins at first) who is the European American being unwelcomed into the neighborhood, even though he was born there. The opening has Rosie Perez who plays Mookie's girlfriend dancing to the theme song. The film centers around Sal's Famous Pizzeria owned by Sal (Aiello) and his sons' the racist Pino (Turturro) and Vito (Richard Edson from Stranger than Paradise). Another segue character is the stutterer who goes through town selling the photo of Malcolm X and MLK together (Spike would later go on to direct the great biopic Malcolm X with Denzel Washington). The racial tension builds throughout the day until it culminates in a confrontation with Radio Raheem and Sal. It ends up in a riot with the inevitable overreacting police (the more things change the more they stay the same). Spike Lee created a classic work of art here, but didn't rise to the challenge of becoming an \"auteur\", since none of his other films comes close to this (possible exception of \"Malcolm X\", but that was a much different genre).I saw this in the theater in 1989 and it only grows on you with more viewings.",

            "content": "Do the Right Thing is Spike Lee's best movie, by a long shot, and the best film to address race in America. This is the movie that Crash wanted to be; it could not have missed the mark more completely. On every level--visual aesthetic, acting, direction, pacing, etc.--this film succeeds. That it's also an immensely intelligent dissection of race in America (not just simply race in Bed-Stuy) elevates it above other well-made pictures about ethnic strife (I'm looking at you Grand Canyon). Why is this movie more intelligent than Crash? I would argue that, because it works on a smaller scale, it allows the characters to grow and seem more organic. Mookie, Radio Raheem, Buggin' Out, Da Mayor, and Mother Sister, among others, all seem like real, viable characters. We spend enough time with them over the course of the film's two hours to understand them and their motivations. When Ryan Phillippe shoots Larenz Tate at the end of Crash, it feels remarkably like a plot machination put there to make a point rather than a direction that the film should logically make. However, Mookie's choice to throw a garbage can through the window of Sal's restaurant makes complete and total sense given the events that have been occurring that day. It's an event caused by exhaustion and frustration; we understand why Mookie would do it even if we don't agree with him. We might understand Phillippe's actions in Crash (he thought Tate had a gun), but they seem a bit more unrealistic. That's the other wonderful thing about Do the Right Thing--its balancing of realistic characters with a color saturated and unreal Brooklyn neighborhood. Lee's direction and Ernest Dickerson's magnificent cinematography remind me for no tangible reason of Marvel Comics from the 1960s and 1970s. The world in which these characters operates seems a little unreal and that only heightens their naturalism. It's an amazing touch and one of which I am in awe. Then there's the acting. I cannot think of a single weak performance in this film; it's a wonderful ensemble. I've always been a particular fan of Danny Aiello's and Spike's performances and that makes sense--they carry the film. The supporting roles are filled with the likes of John Turturro and Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee and Richard Edson. It's also got a nice turn from Samuel L. Jackson as the Greek chorus/DJ. Do the Right Thing, though, would fail in spite of its realistic characters, performances, cinematography, and direction if it were not for a thematically ambiguous story. What is the right thing referred to in the title? To me the answer has always been no thing. Nobody in the film, really, does the right thing except, maybe Vito, Mother Sister, or Da Mayor, but that's questionable, as those characters don't actually do anything. Their inaction is just as much an indictment of their character as Mookie's throwing the garbage can, Buggin' Out's silly campaign, Radio Raheem's anger, the policeman's murdering Raheem, Sal's latent (and Vito's obvious) racism, etc. Or maybe those actions are the right thing? I don't think so, but I'm sure someone could make a convincing argument in support of Buggin' Out's boycott or Mookie's can-throwing. That's why this movie works---it's complicated and muddy. It's morally relativistic just like the world. Spike Lee has been often labeled as polemical, but he's anything but in this film. It's a film that's angry about the state of race in America but that's nevertheless willing to point the finger in all directions at once. That's a rare thing to see in cinema, and it's the rare thing Crash aspired to achieve only to fail.",

Lee's neighbourhood is strangely devoid of gangs and gang members (surely the salient features of any tough US urban neighbourhood) and he focuses on (and himself acts) the role of a struggling individual trying to hold down a job in a small business run by an Italian-origin family.As if he has internalised the US majority's anti-black prejudice, Lee depicts working-class black society as infantilized, leaderless and incoherent, and it is hardly surprising when a ridiculous confrontation over a trivial issue blows up into an ugly, mindless riot. There seem to be no proper adults among the gabbling, show-off blacks, and the action largely concerns the incoherent ramblings of directionless characters who only coalesce when they rise up in insensate fury.Viewing the picture 20 years late, my strong reaction to the riot was for everyone on the street to be locked up forthwith and get their heads well knocked together. That's certainly what would happen in Africa, but the USA has its own peculiar baggage: a racial melting pot in which most blacks stay permanently at the bottom of the mix, and new waves of immigrants regularly sail past them into prosperity.Lee was clearly trying to address this issue, but the necessity of making an entertaining film about amusing people to sell seats and pay off the Studio's investment tended to trivialise his efforts: when the riot does occur it is all the more shockingly senseless because the people involved have been caricatured throughout the action. Although Lee cites gifted leaders, M.L. King and Malcolm X, and brandishes their portraits, at the end of this film it is hard to believe that these grandiloquent public men arose from the same confused, purposeless people that Lee depicts.",

In the 2020s, there might be more people on cell phones, fashions may be different, and perhaps filmmakers use different techniques and equipment, but otherwise this movie could have been filmed in 2021. The setting, characters, and themes remain very relevant.This is a story about racial tensions in a black neighborhood and it tries to cover diverse viewpoints broadly. The story centers around Sal's Pizzeria, an Italian shop in this neighborhood manned by one of the \"white\" holdouts who is providing services to the locals and his two sons. While he mostly stays on good terms with his customers and tries to see each of them as individuals. He displays warm feelings toward Mookie as well as many of his customers, but he also has a short fuse.The main black character is Mookie, who works as a delivery boy in the pizzeria. He tries to work as a mediator between the crew of Sal's Pizzeria and the black residents, knowing he needs the money Sal pays him to survive but also seeming to feel some sort of affinity to him and his family.Cultural misunderstandings, stubbornness, and tiny grievances add up, however, and even level-headed Mookie and Sal, which are the most culturally well-adjusted characters, lose their cool on this hot summer day. In the end, we are reminded of the Bismack quote about World War I, viz, that it would be kicked off by some \"silly little thing in the Balkans.\"The wounds between the communities run so deep and so old that even something as silly as not having pictures of any black people in a pizzeria, being a little too friendly with a woman, or being asked to turn one's music down becomes a spark that lights this conflagration and leads to the explosive conclusion.This is a masterpiece of ethnic relations where a pizza shop on a nondescript corner in a nameless black neighborhood becomes a representation of human tribalism that has existed from the beginning of human history and shows no signs of abating. When two different groups are forced to stay in contact and they don't respect each other's boundaries, the tinder of rage will just go on piling up until it gets to a point where any small flame becomes an existential danger to it.Can it be fixed? Can it be avoided? Probably, but the film offers no solutions. It's not about that.Honourable Mentions: The Kite Runner (2007). Another pretty effective movie about racial tensions in Afqanestaan. In this case it's more about the drama of the story than about exploring the theme, but a good movie nonetheless!",

But you would never guess it to watch this movie. The residents are all merely misunderstood, mistreated and put upon.

            "content": "***SPOILERS***Spike Lee's 1989 film \"Do the Right Thing\" is a very controversial and misunderstood film.  Add to that, the movie's anthem \"Fight The Power\" by political rap group, Public Enemy, whose \"black power\"-themed music bangs throughout the film.  Spike Lee has been called by some, to be a racist and a hate monger.  The fact that he has a group like Public Enemy, whose frontman Carlton \"Chuck D\" Ridenhour is considered a racist too, doesn't make things much easier.  Like Lee's later film, \"Clockers,\" \"Do the Right Thing\" doesn't offer us answers, but pretty much leaves that up to the viewer to decide.As Roger Ebert stated in his review of the film, a lot of Lee's themes are very elusive in this movie, and are done that way because it's very hard to understand the race issue in this country.  The movie doesn't just look at blacks, it looks at all races; black is the central group I guess because Lee is black too.  As an African-American, I find Spike Lee's films to be real eye-openers to the problems associated with race in America.  He doesn't blame the white power structure, like a lot of young black filmmakers often tended to do, but shows that we ourselves may be partially to blame also.A lot of people question whether or not the events in the movie convincingly led to the conclusion, where Mookie (played by Spike Lee himself) throws a trash can through the window of Sal's Pizzeria.  Then a riot breaks out. People say that Mookie caused the riot.  Absolutely not true.  The riot was started by the murder of Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn), who was killed only moments earlier by the police.We know that Spike Lee is a fond admirer of our two greatest leaders: Martin Luther King, Jr. and Malcolm X, whose quotes on violence are featured just before the ending credits roll.  Smiley (Roger Guenveur Smith) is a follower of these two, as we see him selling their photos to people.  Both Martin and Malcolm had opposing views of race in America, but they didn't hate each other, and they shared a common goal of achieving civil rights.  This applies in the film to the question of whether or not there is a solution to racism in America.Some say that this movie is racist against whites, especially in regards to white cops and Italian-Americans.  I don't think so.  In my opinion, Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) is the one who is solely responsible for the events that occur later in the film.  Because Buggin' himself is a racist, he is the one that started the chain reaction by trying to organize a boycott of Sal's Famous for not having pictures of African-Americans on the \"Wall of Fame,\" which is populated by Italian-Americans.  It doesn't paint a view of racist white cops; it paints a view of cops who are white, whose attitudes towards the blacks are perhaps simple observations made by Spike Lee. Maybe it is a little biased, but it's simply how Lee views them.In regards to Italian-Americans, Lee paints a view of a well-liked and honest businessman - Sal (Danny Aiello) and his two sons Pino (John Turturro) and Vito (Richard Edson).  Sal loves his neighborhood and his pizzeria is the only white business left, after all of the other white businesses moved out.  Pino is a racist who hates the blacks, while Vito has opened himself up a little bit to the neighborhood.  It is Sal who smashes Radio Raheem's music, who shouts \"ni**er!\" in his face and afterwards, is nearly killed by Radio.  Sal didn't deserve what happened to his restaurant, that's clear.  But I believe he should have used better judgment when trying to deal with the situation and Radio, Buggin', and Smiley should have left before something bad did happen.Some say that Public Enemy, are racists.  Their song, \"Fight the Power\" is played throughout this movie, and has been called by some to be an angry, black hate song.  Yes, Chuck D like Spike Lee, has a lot to be angry about, but it doesn't show itself in his music.  Yes in \"Fight the Power,\" there are racial insults directed towards such \"American\" icons like Elvis Presley and John Wayne.  I do not believe that Public Enemy are racists because they have sought to educate their listeners on the issues of racism in this country, and have gone to great lengths of doing so.True, \"Do the Right Thing\" is a very infuriating movie to watch, but it really makes you think about what race has come to stand for in America.",

Not even Atticus Finch from To Kill A Mockingbird would have anything to say about this and even his character is among the top heroes for thinking racism is bad.Our hero is no other than Mookie (played by Spike Lee), a young man who's working at a dead end job delivering pizzas so that way he could support his wife (Rosie Perez) and child. Sal's Pizza is where he works at and it's runned by Sal (Danny Aiello) along with his two grown sons played by John Turturro and Michael Edson. Sal has been in the joint since forever and is very kind to all the people no matter what color or background they have. His sons Pino and Vito are very different however. Vito (Edson) is the only son who shows generosity to those around him like his father, where Pino (Turturro) has the hatred for black people and even Mookie gives him a lesson by asking him all the questions from favorite entertainers and all of his answers are African American entertainers (Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan).There are different characters in this film from Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn of Spider-Man) who carries his boom box everywhere as his heart and soul. There's Da Mayor (Ozzie Davis) who knows everybody's business in Brooklyn. Giancarlo Esposito plays Buggin Out, a black militant who loathes Sal and his restaurant so much that he wants to boycott after seeing that there aren't any African Americans on the wall. Samuel L. Jackson, in a small and good role, plays Mister Senor Love Daddy, Brooklyn's voice where not only does he start his music at six in the morning but is the voice of reason for everybody to chill out.While there are some moments were you will laugh, there are scenes that make you think about what goes on including a montage where Spike directs scenes of different actors saying about how they feel about the races around them. While it'll make you laugh, it'll make you think about how the human race works.The last part of the film is an important act where all I have to say is tragedy; even it's final frame doesn't have the answer about the right thing.\"Do the Right Thing\" is not only an important piece of cinema, but an important piece that'll make you think of how we act with one another and hopefully we'll learn to accept those around us despite our differences.",

I was expecting to be simply blown away by this movie. Instead, and much to my chagrin, I was forced to watch this half-hearted high school play. Poor acting, patronizing script, uneventful, boring action that never leaves one and a half block of a boring neighborhood. How's this a good movie?OK, I understand that the topic is a hot button -- racial unrest in one of the most racist countries in the world (or at least, in the country with one of the most overt racist history). But so what? It's not the premise that counts, it's the delivery. And this delivery sucks!The characters in this movie were all poorly drawn out to look like cardboard cutouts. Too much stereotyping, no real character development. The movie is desperately trying to tug in on the cheap sentiment that is prevalent in today's general public.This movie is a disgrace. It's about time someone finally makes a real, honest and serious movie about the racial unrest in the States. Something like \"Crash\", only a bit less disjointed.Oh yeah, a piece of advice for Spike Lee -- it's not a good idea to cast all your buddies in the film. Next time, try auditioning for the roles, before you begin shooting the movie. The acting in this movie was just terrible.1 out of 10",

            "content": "How often do we see a film as powerful & engrossing as 'Do the Right Thing'? I mean this was way back in 1989, when Producer/Writer/Director Spike Lee blew up the big-screen with a hard-hitting, gut wrenchingly honest story on racism, that, sadly, remains timely to this day. And despite choosing a subject as grim as this one, Lee, the genius, presents it like an entertainer, that never comes across as a lecture or a depressing experience. It roars without ever screaming at your face!'Do the Right Thing' Synopsis: On the hottest day of the year on a street in the Bedford- Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, everyone's hate and bigotry smolders and builds until it explodes into violence.'Do the Right Thing' is about people engulfed with hate & pressure, despite having the ability to 'love'. Spike Lee delivers an important, smart & unforgettable tale on racism & its pointlessness, with interestingly diverse characters, right from White, Black, Italian & Asian. Lee has Written each character with a distinctive personality, thus, making them all interesting, a few even being memorable. The climax here is a reflective & provocative one, one that truly asks you the question - Why is this happening & if there is a problem, is the solution always this ruthless? I won't give away spoilers, as there might be some readers out who are yet to see this film. But, Lee's question in the finale will throw you in a tightrope & you'll have to figure yourself who actually you stood for & why. Its truly thought-provoking! Lee's Writing is masterful. His Screenplay is among the most important ones Cinema has Produced. Its intense, intelligent, volatile & entirely engrossing, all at the same time. Lee's Direction is Fantastic. He has handled this terrific film, with a touch of realism, that's so rare in movies nowadays. Special Mentions for Ernest Dickerson's Cinematography, Barry Alexander Brown's Editing & The Excellent Art & Costume Design. Now coming to the Performances: Lee shines an an actor as well. He embodies the central part with unmistakable honesty. But the show- stealer here is undoubtedly Danny Aiello. In his portrayal of Sal the pizzeria owner, Aiello is simply astonishing. Right from his body-language to his powerful dialogue delivery, Aiello offers a true acting masterclass! Its among the finest performances of all-time & there is no exaggeration here! Of the rest of the cast, John Turturro is remarkable as Aiello's conflicted son Pino, while The Late/Great Ruby Dee is haunting as Mother Sister. The Late/Great Ossie Davis as Da Mayor, is wonderfully restrained. The Late/Great Bill Nunn is excellent & Rosie Perez as Tina, in her breakout role, is feisty. Rest lend great support.On the whole, 'Do the Right Thing' is a powerful piece of modern cinema. Its a film that demands your attention, asks you questions & never forgets to keep you engrossed. This one's a MASTERPIECE!",

            "content": "I have to say this is Spike Lee's first truly classic film because School Daze really does nothing unless your a certain person. That person being someone who went to an all black college. I feel that film had a lot to say for that type of person and it would have been meaningful for them but having not been from that type of background it does almost nothing for me. I also have yet to see She Gotta Have It. I went to really bad and I do hope it is classic but I have not scene it so I will not judge it tell the time that I view it comes along, hopefully soon. Do the Right Thing, has a lot to say for everyone about race relations. If you think the movement is over this film shows you that there is still some things that need to be accomplished, especially in the hood. It shows that some white people will go down there make a buck and never care what kinda of job opportunities they are taking away from the black community that lives there. I feel though that it also shows that some people of color have not progressed either. Lee may have not meant for it to be there but that is what I take from. If they had maintained cooler heads at the end of the film than Radio Rahem would have lived, but because they felt the need to throw a fit over there being no black players on Sal's Pizzas's walls then they caused his death. I can see where if your black and wanted to take it from the perspective that Sal caused it by being racist that you too would be right. I feel that both sides had done wrong and that maybe the film is saying that we should come together and grow as a society.I love this film's stellar cast. It has up comers, Martin Lawerance, John Turrtoro, Spike Lee, Joie Lee, Samuel L. Jackson, Bill Nunn, and Ginocarlo Espisito. It also has a couple of old pros, Ruby Dee, doing some of her best work, and her long time husband and great actor Ossie Davis. It also has an actor who would sadly not be given much time to grow, the late great Robin Harris, I hate that he is deceased and feel that he had a triumphant career ahead of him. Spike Lee's direction is good in this and I love who he tries to show his love for his home town area. I also like Ernest Dickerson's surreal lighting and set ups through the film. The whole movie looks as if it's backgrounds could have been drawn in that is how beautiful Dickerson makes reality.

It wants to explore the complexities of racism and make some kind of statement about people needing to show some respect to each other, even if they are from different environments and backgrounds and cultures. But in the end, I didn't really connect with the story or the characters or the plot. I agree with other posters here who stated that in many scenes the characters seem to be just shouting back and forth and not really acting out roles. In the end this has got to be one of the most overrated movies that was loved by critics everywhere. Spike may be da man, but this was a swing and a miss IMHO.",

            "content": "Spike Lee's film \"Do the Right Thing\" is a daring, risky piece that looks at the serious social issues of race relations and violence.  Unfortunately, Lee chose to tackle these issues in only his fourth ever film...his first for a major studio.  Lee's inexperience shows.  While the film is visually stunning, it lacks a cohesive story or a coherent plot.\"Do the Right Thing\" is set in the Bedford-Stuyvesant (Bed-Stuy) neighborhood of Brooklyn on the hottest day of the summer.  Production designer Wynn Thomas and Cinematographer Ernest R. Dickerson evoke the heat of the day visually with the use of various hues of red in costuming, lighting and scene painting.  Particularly stunning is the bright red wall in front of which three neighborhood men sit all day and complain.  The perceived temperature is driven up at least five degrees just through that use of color.  It also provides a visual connection to the dissatisfaction and hate these men continually vent.It would have been nice to see the amount of red on the screen change as time passes.  By constantly bombarding the viewer with bright red, Thomas keeps the heat level constant.  The only shot in the movie that increases the perceived temperature after the first five minutes is a shot of random people on the street with heat waves rising in front of the camera.  Had the use of red been tempered early in the film and then allowed to grow as the day gets hotter, the audience would more clearly see the heat increasing and have a more visually fulfilling experience.The film also has trouble establishing a coherent theme.  The film's climax is particularly rich in contradictions.  As the riot ensues Lee uses canted angles; fast, hard cuts; and alternates long shot and tight medium shot to make the viewer feel uncomfortable watching the violent acts that are taking place.  The viewer can find no frame of reference from which to observe the action.  This causes the viewer to be unsettled.  Ordinarily this technique is employed to convey the idea that the action on the screen is wrong.(minor spoiler)\nAs the riot comes to a close, however, the character Smiley walks into the pizzeria and hangs a picture of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. on the wall.  As he does so, he is shot at eye-level in a medium close-up. Behind him, flames billow up creating a halo around his head, ennobling him. Smiley was one of the people who started the riot.  By ennobling him, Lee ennobles the violence Smiley advocates.  Is the viewer supposed to approve of the violence or disapprove?  The film's conclusion is no help there. Conflicting quotes from Dr. King and Malcolm X provide the same contradiction.  Is violence an acceptable means of dealing with racism? What is the viewer supposed to believe as a result of seeing the film?A film that strongly conveys a viewpoint must be consistent.  It is permissible for films to be ambiguous thematically, but when they are, they must be truly ambiguous to succeed.  By conveying anti-violent and pro-violence ideas both effectively, Lee only causes the audience to be confused.  Perhaps if he had more experience as a storyteller, his effort would have been more successful.",

            "content": "\"Do the Right Thing\" was the third directing project for Spike Lee who also wrote the starred in the film as well. This movie was the first of his to cause a bit of a controversy outside the black community. This popular character-study drama has conjured two Oscar nominations which Lee was nodded for best script writing and star Danny Aiello was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The controversy was over the in-your-face depiction regarding the racial intentions that has manifested in America over the years and even back in 1989 and even as I speak, it's still hasn't been fully settled. Situated in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn during one of the hottest days of the summer, \"Do the Right Thing\" tells the events of immense racial friction that materializes in a mostly black- populated community and the enforcing rage behind it which ends in an uproarious riot.In spite of the story being very unsettling with stress and racial conflicts manifesting throughout this movie, it's actually a rich character study with amazing and very interesting and well developed characters. Lee himself stars in this movie as Mookie, sporting a Brooklyn Dodgers jersey with the number 42 Jackie Robinson as he's working as a low-paid pizza delivery boy at Famous Sal's Pizzeria. He's a well-meaning young man who has a steady relationship with his Latino girlfriend Tina (Rosie Perez) and his young infant son, Hector. Lee succeeds in making Mookie not entirely a positive role model, but still in spite of his numerous flaws, can be described as likable with a steady brain above his shoulders. He is the typical young man next door we can relate to and easy to sympathize with in all the hard times he's faced with in everyday life. Sal Fragione (Danny Aiello) is the owner of the Pizzeria and one of the last remaining Italian-Americans in this part of the community. He's a hard-working, dedicated businessman who for the past 25 years has taken pride that he's paid all his bills due to the loyal patrons who have consumed his food. To say he is a pleasant man is a bit of a stretch. He's tough, a bit mouthy and has a very short temper to the point of being a bit unethical at times. His elder son Pino (John Turturro) is a chip off the old block and he may express more volatile rage than his Pappy. Pino hates where he's working and is not afraid to express his bigotry. He hates his job, his life and does zero to change it almost as if he likes to be angry just for the sake of it. He loves to ostracize his more laid- back younger brother Vito (Richard Edson) who he think's is a pussy. Vito is close friends with Mookie and accepts the ethnic diversity in the area and wants to be close friends with the African and Latino Americans who live in the area. Rounding out the residents in the area we have someone called Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) who's an inebriated old codger who does small menial jobs just to pay the rent and get drunk. In spite of himself, everyone looks up to him like father figure as he gives friendly advice to the kids on the street. He is smitten by the very ethical landlady called the Mother Sister (real-life wife of Davis Ruby Dee) as she's always perched by her window looking on at the passersby in her neighborhood. A pre-famed Samuel L. Jackson plays a more cooler collected role than usual as the local radio personality here as Mister Senor Love Daddy who serves as a narrator behind the city heat and chaotic turn of events erupting in the area. Roger Guenveur Smith was excellent in his performance as Smiley, a simpleton who lobbies around the streets selling portraits of iconic African-American heroes like Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. A well-meaning buffoon, even though he gets on passersby's nerves. Then there's ML, Coconut Sid and Slick Willie (Paul Benjamin, Frankie Faison and Robin Harris) are three jobless gentlemen who pass their time of days just sitting there chatting away about nothing. But the real scene stealing performances come from the characters of Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) and Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn). Buggin Out is an extremely hot-tempered radical who refuses to dine at Sal's Pizzeria not because of the food, but because on his Wall of Fame, Sal has only Italian-American icons posted on his wall much to the chagrin of Buggin Out. After an intense verbal conflict with Sal after he threatens him with a baseball bat, Buggin Out goes out on a crusade and gathers other community members to boycott Sal's unless Sal adds some 'brothers\" to his wall. Radio Raheem constantly prances around town blasting to Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\" on his boom box while sporting Love and Hate knuckle-rings on his fingers as he memorizes Robert Mitchum's speech repeatedly. There's a funny scene where he enters a convenience store and ask for batteries from a Korean clerk. He plays a very important part in this movie. With the juxtapose of humor and drama in the script, Lee compliments the film with his yellows and browns to bring the mood and intense atmosphere into a very frightening film that ends in an emotional, heartbreaking final climax, that ends in utter chaos. The racial tensions are quite in-your-face like one scene where various characters spew off racial hatred towards a certain ethnic group which is shocking and quite disturbing at times. It's a human test to see how far people will go through to get what they want. \"Do the Right Thing\" has aged gracefully and even after 27 years, racial tensions have not settled down as equality is still in demand (look at the Oscars of 2016 for example).",

When watching it today, I feel anger in my compassion because I sincerely believe that had everyone spoke with a little more respect to one another, the tension would have been slighted resulting in an alternate ending. Overall, my emotions don't affect my opinion of this being an outstanding film.Spike Lee is an amazing writer and director that puts the hard truth on the big screen for the world to take notice. This film is the epitome of not only what was happening then, but what is still happening today. The acting was mostly spot on for the era and location, but the exception is Spike Lee himself. He appeared very stiff and out of place through most of the film, but it didn't detract from the message.

We watch with dread as all the setup finally unfolds, without restraint, with tragic aftermath.The main characters and the dialogue shared between them rings true, almost relateable in the sense that we share the same weaknesses, and we all have our lot of negative criticism to our surroundings. Spike Lee understands his characters, and creates three-dimensional personalities through his obvious experience with racial intolerance.Lee's perfect structure and visual enticement is one trademark he uncannily includes in all of his films. His structure never descends into an episodic, forced stream of events, he never adds random, implausible plot elements to boost interest. His films usually hold a wide range of ideas and satirical merit, but with restrained, authentic execution. Only during his climaxes does he take his films to another dimension of realism, but even those usually hold sardonic entity.Overall, Do The Right Thing is a visceral, unique experience, one that doesn't preach that racism is bad, but shows you how cultural and ethical differences can tear apart an entire community.",

Apparently we are all the same as Italians) and there is no clear line about whether he advocates Ghandi-like non violent approaches, or if he suggests more outright protests against the establishment.There is really just nothing to special about this movie. It's a view of life in the black ghettos of Brooklyn, and how all the different sects of race and people view each other. It even featured five minutes of them all talking smack about each other's flaws as a race. Even stranger, the older generations of the African Americans are being outright disrespected by the younger ones.It also seems to me that Sal has done nothing wrong to the community, most everybody buys pizza there. He owns the shop, he should be able to put whoever he wants on the walls, if that tweaky guy wanted to see more black people, why doesn't he just open his own pizza place and dedicate a wall to his heroes? And, If I was the owner of a business, black or white Radio had no right to come in and blast his music (no matter what genre) I consider that disrespectful to anybody. Of course there was only one racist white guy in the whole movie, Sal's son, who at least sucked it up and did his job and didn't go around fighting with them or anything. Anyway, the portrayals of races in this movie were extremely stereotypical, and offensive to me.In all, I would never watch this movie again, nor I will be taking the time to watch other Spike Lee works because he has effectively wasted my time and insulted me.

The end really upset me because I feel as if the riot was aimed at the wrong character. It was not Sal or anything that Sal did that led to Radio Raheem's death, yet a riot broke out that left his business ruined.

I felt as if no one did the right thing, and there was no lesson to be learned really, and I just don't get it.

After watching it I have to admit those people were right. The movie showed a Brooklyn street during a heat wave in the summer. This block was mostly African Americans however there was a pizzeria owned by Italians as well as a grocery store owned by Koreans. The movie showed how different minority groups view each other. I found it extremely interesting during the montage of racial slurs to see that even groups who are harassed because of their ethnicity still do it to other groups. The end of the movie really surprised me. I figured there would be some sort of clash of the groups however I didn't think that it would explode the way it did. Another part of the movie which really surprised me was how the police were portrayed, as murderers and bigots. One scene in the movie which really stuck with me was when the fire fighters were trying to put out the fire and they used the hose on the African American rioters. This scene to me really showed how not much has changed in some sense since the 1960s. Overall I found this movie to be extremely well done and very powerful and definitely one of Spike Lee's best movies.",

The cinematography is extremely surreal, the characters are very over the top, and there isn't much of a story. But who says that's a bad thing? First of all, I love the cinematography in this movie. It's very unique, and really puts you in the madness of this film's world. A lot of the time, it feels like a music video, and it keeps you on edge throughout the whole thing. Second of all, I love that the characters are over the top. Like I just said, it really puts you into this mad world. Most of the characters are obnoxious, a lot of the characters are racist, and a lot of the characters aren't really likable; but then again, so are most of the people on Earth. Third, there isn't much of a story, but then again, why should there be? This is another one of those movies where it's all about the experience. This movie doesn't have a three-act structure. We're not rooting for anyone, we're not taking sides; we're just sitting back and letting the message sink in. What I love about this movie is how it doesn't tell the audience how to feel. It doesn't force people to take sides. It just presents you with racism, and lets you decide how to feel about it for yourself. I've heard people say they hate this film because the characters are unlikable and mostly racist\u0085Hi, welcome to planet Earth. Can I take your coat? Um, hello, these are real issues people. Racism is real. Police brutality is real. Riots are real. You can't hate this movie just because you don't like being shown what the world is really like. I'm not saying you have to like this movie; but I can't stand when people completely miss the point of a movie. Of course there's racism in the movie. It's a Spike Lee movie. I'm not really big into Spike Lee movies, but I appreciate what he puts into his movies. He's not forcing us to identify with or like these characters. He's not saying, \"Whites on this side, blacks on this side; let the games begin\". He's just letting us know that stuff like this happens everyday, and it could happen at anytime and anywhere. It's a very hard film to watch, but that's what makes it so memorable. I can't even think of another movie about racism like this. Oh well, bottom line; I think this is a good movie, and addresses the issue of race in a very interesting way. I would say this movie is for everyone, so you can hate this movie if you want; just don't hate it for stupid reasons.",

Furthermore, an interesting contradiction is put forth: The African American community resents being segregated but applauds their own efforts in removing the Italian family from the neighborhood.If the movie's message is that the white police are brutal and kill innocent black men, then the message is completely off base. The police were really just doing their job and trying to restrain a murderous lunatic. Nevertheless, the movie incites passion on both sides of the aisle; and therefore, it is a highly affective film.Was Mookie justified in inciting violence? In my opinion: No. The call to violence justified by Malcolm X (and this film) is disturbing and needs to be questioned. 'Do the Right Thing' presents a bulky theme and is a lot to digest.",

            "content": "It's the warmest day of the year in Brooklyn, New York but it's not just the temperature that's boiling tempers are too within a small area of Brooklyn where a small multicultural community are living within a Brooklyn neighbourhood. It seems that not everyone is prepared to co-exist within this kind of environment causing far-reaching consequences...It's fairly obvious from the plot summary what kind of film Do The Right Thing is going to be and what kind of message it is going to paint. Although the film does deliver its inevitable message I still can't say I was all that pleased with what I was actually presented with here.The film begins by showing us some of the different communities within the community and the people that inhabit said community. The trouble is that Spike Lee (as director) just blitzes round the whole neighbourhood like the Tasmanian devil barely pausing for breath. The majority of the African-American community are either loud or obnoxious (or both in many cases) and it's fair to say that they are quite trying on one's patience over a 2 hour running time. I presume they were purposefully playing clich\u00e9s, but I have to admit that all the yelling and squabbling was more irritating than insightful. Then you have other characters like the guy with the stutter and the 3 African-American blokes sat in chairs who only seem to be there to just pad out the running time - can't recall them having any real involvement in the story. Then you have the Korean family who again are given no dimension whatsoever (they are once again 'clich\u00e9s' where the only thing that is ever said about them is that they 'can't speak proper English). In fact their appearance and contribution is so slight that had they been omitted from the film altogether then it would have made no difference at all. The American-Italian family headed up by Sal are of some interest and I did like the idea of Sal embracing the idea of racial integration and wanting to remain where he'd been for the last 25 years (despite one of his son's objections). Sal also employs an African American within his pizza parlour further confirming that he's trying to embrace the culture as opposed to fighting against it. I would have preferred it if the focus had been shifted more on to Sal and his family and their inner conflicts rather than a lot of the nonsense that was happening in the ghetto.Arguably, the biggest problem with this film actually lies with Spike Lee and his entire approach to the material; as an African-American himself he isn't exactly the most objective of people and really lays everything on thick here. About 80% of the film and dialogue belongs to the African-Americans; the Koreans are in the film for all of 5 minutes and aren't painted in a particularly good light. The American-Italian family are made to look like the villains at the end even though Sal tried to do everything he could to keep the peace. Radio Raheem's death at the hands of the police is never reflected upon (even when Sal tells Mookie that it was they that killed Raheem rather than him). It's clear that Spike Lee is passionate about this sort of thing after all he did direct Malcom X (which I haven't seen, but know what it's about) and I do admire his enthusiasm with this project. However, I feel that his passion has clouded his judgment and a more even-handed approach was needed to this material. He was right to act in the film, but probably should have left the directing to someone else.Overall I did like the message about the futility of racism and the notion that nobody wins in the end (although lifting quotes from Malcom X and Martin Luther King at the end seemed to be another case of Lee battering his message over our heads), but truthfully it's far too heavy-handed, one-sided, preachy, indulgent and self-important for my liking.",

Some might think \"Do the right thing\" was an anti - white polemic designed to do precisely what it did in many fractured communities;stir up African-American passions and polarise the races even further. As this was obviously not Mr Lee's intention the only conclusion I can come to is that he badly miscalculated the affect it would have on its audiences. Was Rodney King a martyr to LAPD racism or a career criminal drugged out of his mind subject to a bit of \"street justice\" from a handful of fired-up cops?Was O.J.

But their energy really brings the movie to light. The film is packed with great actors. I enjoyed the set and costume design. The film was real color-full. Buggin outs name really fits him well. I liked how the named of some of the character describes them I thought that was real creative. Such as Radio Raheem and MotherSiste. The film deals primarily with issues of race. Racism against black, whites, Chinese, and Puerto Ricans. You can tell that different characters are struggling with this issue. I believe the films not only deals with race issues but a lot of miscommunication. Buggin out thought brother should be on the wall because that is Sal primary customer base. Buggin out doesn't get that Sal wont put brothers on the wall because this is not his place. Sal's wall of fame consists of heroes in his heritage. He even tells Buggin out that if it was his place he could do what he wants. Buggin out takes it as Sal is ungrateful for the community that makes his pizza place run. Also in the scene towards the end sees Radio Raheem radio as a material object. But to Raheem it is a part of his identify. When Sal smashes the radio, because of the noise, Raheem takes it a Sal smashing a piece of him. This causes the situation to esulates into a riot.",

The entertainment level here is high, between the dialogue and the who's who of future '90s stars (seriously, *everyone's* in this movie). That sweltering heat is the ideal backdrop for festering racial tensions, but what's refreshing is in the way Lee goes about it. Empathy exists on both sides of the battle line. Good and evil aren't so easily defined, and there are those in the wrong, but no one's really a bad guy. Except for the police, which is what makes this uncomfortable even today.

            "content": "Racial relations in films leave much room for sugarcoating and biased views of one or more people on the cast and crew, but thankfully, Spike Lee is too smart to take sides or choose whose battle to support. In Do the Right Thing, he shows how racial relations have hurt one specific street block in Brooklyn. The result soars past any expectations one has going into it.The film plays like an anthology, featuring people that resemble real people, and who pack in realistic flaws. It takes place on a brutally hot day in the neighborhood, with the temperature in the late nineties to early hundreds. The film's center is a pizzeria on the street, called Sal's Famous, which is run by an Italian father and his two sons. The father is Sal Frangione (Aiello) who has been on the block for over twenty years, and his sons Pino (Turturro) who refers to coming to work like \"Planet of the Apes,\" and Vito (Edson) who is accepting of the blacks.They're the only white people we see throughout the whole film and yet, despite some of their comments, we can sympathize with them in a way. All they want to do is run a business, but odd complications plague their day. The only black character employed at the pizzeria is slacker Mookie (played by Spike Lee himself). Mookie is a gentle and sweet kid, but seems to develop a distracting fondness for anything but his work.Other people around down are simple, frequently drunk \"Da Mayor\" (Davis), Mother Sister (Dee), who observes the neighborhood through her window, Radio Raheem (Nunn), who blasts his music at deafening level on his boombox, which annoys many, Buggin' Out (Esposito), a geeky man who wants to see some black people on the wall of Sal's Famous, and Sonny (Park), a Korean grocery store owner across the street from Sal.Not a lot of films can perfect the idea of \"all characters, no plot,\" but Do the Right Thing is effortlessly convincing. The film also excels in being extremely original and stylistic in the sense that the heat from the day itself seems to be creeping out on screen. All the characters are soaked in sweat and the cinematography is so bright and loaded with primary colors that it comes off as infectious and unique. Even the air looks to be seamy and murky. Every detail is included, and nothing is overlooked.Finally, there's the climax, one of the best, most involved I have yet to see. It's unexpected, well-choreographed, and never misses a beat. It doesn't seem cartoony, as much as it seems realistic and well done. I wish I could go into greater detail, but it needs to be seen to be believed. Also, one of the characters does an act you wouldn't think that insights one of the major plot points. I think it's safe to say, he didn't do the right thing.Do the Right Thing isn't only provocative, but it avoids clich\u00e9s and doesn't give us the same \"racism is bad\" lecture. It's too original and intelligent for that. Lee has introduced us to likable characters that we continue to adore as the film goes on, and despite the heavy climax, we still at least respect. You're left contemplating what the right thing is/was and how would you go about doing it.Starring: Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Spike Lee, Giancarlo Esposito, John Turturro, Ruby Dee, Steve Park, Bill Nunn, Richard Edson, Rosie Perez, Martin Lawrence, and Samuel L.

Call it 'the system', call it 'the power', call it even 'America', there's obviously one enemy that ought to be fought. Who? What? \"Do the Right Thing\" is precisely essential because it doesn't try to provide definite answers about guilt but to raise right questions about responsibility. For this \u2013I guess-, the film was fittingly voted #96 in AFI's Top 100 Greatest Movies and although I don't believe it redeems some shameful Oscar snubs, I know the film is getting more and more respected.\"Always do the right thing?\" says Da Mayor, \"That's it?\" retorts Mookie, \"That's it!\" Da Mayor is the local old-timer spending the day drinking, meditating, giving advice and occasionally flirting with Mother Sister, a woman of the same generation played by Ruby Dee, Davis' real-life wife, observing the neighborhood's life through the window. The two veterans incarnate the attitude of \"those who know but don't tell\", the wounds from the past exist but they'd rather be turned into a dignified silence if the advice wouldn't keep youth's minds in peace. It's not about fighting the other, but one's own inner demons.That's why reducing the antagonism to a conflict between Blacks and Whites is like imitating the fool who stares at the wise man's finger when he's pointing it to the moon. And speaking of pointing fingers, the most emblematic scene of the film consists of different protagonists facing a camera and delivering a racist rant until the local DJ, Mister Senor Love Daddy tells them to chill out. The iconic racial slur montage illustrates the sad reality that each one has and is an enemy. And in that hateful cacophony, only Samuel L. Jackson sounds like the true voice of reason. And his catchphrase \"\u0085that's the truth, Ruth\" resonates as if he was the one who knew life's secret: embracing the very love he made his nickname out of. And that's one of the most overlooked aspects of the film: \"Do the Right Thing\" speaks as much powerful statements about love than it does about hate.The most significant example is given by Radio Raheem, Bill Nunn as the colossal figure who kept walking by blasting Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\" on his boom box like a non-violent defiance to authority. His LOVE and HATE speech, echoing a famous scene from \"The Night of the Hunter\", establishes the ironic correlation between love and hate as one is only possible from a heart capable of the other, and each one is a double-edged sword leading to potential self-destruction. Both Sal, the owner of the pizzeria (Danny Aiello nominated for Best Supporting Actor) and Radio Raheem, revealed their tender side during the film, but ... we all know that the road to hell can be paved by good intentions.\"Do the Right Thing\" is like a modern Greek tragedy, where no choice would avoid a disaster. And the Oscar-nominated script is a triumph in intelligence in the way it doesn't beg for cheap feelings of sympathy. You don't have to ask yourself if Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) was right or wrong about the pictures in the wall, but why this lead to the climactic riot despite the fact that everyone disagreed with him. I guess that's humanity's tragedy, the most violent people can be the most capable of love and vice-versa, and this highlight Spike Lee's undeniable writing talent when it comes to create real characters, truly three-dimensional.Take the most blatantly racist character: Sal's older son, Pino, one of Turturro's greatest performances. At first sight, he's just a hateful bigot, but when you get to know him, you can see he's a guy who just hates his job, and the same bitterness can be read in Mookie's droopy eyes and laconic talking. The central character played by Spike Lee, a bitter delivery man who wishes to make a more valuable job to take care of his new born son and be a man in the eyes of his Puerto Rican girlfriend, Tina (Rosie Perez) One can even see both Pino and Mookie contemptuously staring at Sal when he smoothly talks to Mookie's sister Jade (Spike Lee's sister in real life), for once they are in the same wavelength, which is ironic since they're both wrong.The film is full of these insightful ironies where no reaction is expectable, Da Mayor tries to prevent Sal and his sons to be lynched by the angry mob, while Mother Sister cries and ask people to burn the fire down. People who suffered the most from racism can't stand the sight of their own people inflicting the same treatment they experienced from the depths of their souls. The climactic mayhem let the most repressed impulses finally explode, in right or wrong. Even the Korean storekeeper shouts that he's black to be spared, and ultimately Smiley, the stuttering militant puts in the burning wall two pictures of the great African American leader : Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X.And the film ends with two quotes from the two men, one insisting that violence is never the solution, and the other that violence is intelligence when it's self-defense, a key to understand the film's intelligence: two people can be in the same wavelength and still be wrong, two others can disagree and be both right \u0085 and that's the simple truth, Ruth.",

            "content": "When the character Buggin' Out asked why there were no pictures of \"brothers\" on the pizzeria walls, would it have killed Sal the owner to put up a picture of Malcolm X or Martin Luther King or Eldridge Cleaver on the wall?  When Mookie doesn't like the fact that maybe Sal might be attracted to his sister Jade, would it have killed him to be firm but polite with his boss? What bothers me about the people in \"Do The Right Thing\" is that the potential peacemakers in the story are overshadowed or out-shouted by the ones who use violence to make their points.  Do you see any strong effort to tolerate one another's differences?  Do you see any one trying to get over their feelings of disgust and despair and anger and hurt?  They are always in each other's faces, even the meekest characters, and so is Ernest Dickerson's obtrusive camera. It's shoved up so close to the actors and the ground that everyone begins to take on iconographic qualities, and everything in the movie seems blown way out of proportion.  You feel like you're witnessing the incessant bickering of the gods on Mount Olympus.I don't think Martin Scorsese's influence on Spike Lee is good.  It's as if \"Do The Right Thing\" is intent on ending in violence, but the end isn't tragic.  When Radio Raheem assaults Sal after his boom box has been destroyed and ends up dead at the hands of the police, do we really feel like the man had no other choice but to take the law into his own hands?  Not really.  Radio Raheem's insistence on blasting Public Enemy's \"Fight The Power\" suggests he was itching for the situation to turn ugly.  And Mookie did the neighborhood a favor by inciting his friends to total Sal's establishment.  Sal is disgusted with his sons and his patrons anyway; he's better off picking up his insurance check and doing something else with his life.  His elder son Pino doesn't want the business, and his younger son Vito doesn't seem smart enough to take it over.Where in \"Do The Right Thing\" are the elements that make men act rationally in heated moments--like family, children, obligations, education, opportunity, hope?  Some of the gripes the black men make in this movie are right on target; and some of them are nothing but incendiary whining.  Does Lee hold up any hope for the men he presents to us? No, he doesn't.  He's content with finishing them off in fire and disdain.  In \"Taxi Driver,\" Travis Bickle was at least trying to make things right.  He goes mad doing it; and, if I'm reading Paul Schrader right, therein lies the shame of it.  There isn't anything after this movie to ponder.  No shame; no sense of loss; no echoes of regret.  Only that the sorry people in this movie get on with their lives.",

            "content": "Covering a hot summer day in a small American neighbourhood composed primarily of African-Americans, Do the Right Thing packs as much style as it is brimming with substance and is a vexing & vibrant portrait of race relations in modern America that comments on everyday racism, hate, bigotry, disparity & hostility through the lens of both despair & agony.Written, produced & directed by Spike Lee, the story takes ample time to give us an authentic sense of the community residing in the depicted streets, and acquaints us with several colourful characters before it all converges towards the explosive finale that always felt inevitable. Lee directs the film with tact & restraint, keeping a cap on its volatile premise for as long as possible.Lee's approach exhibits no shortage of style as evident in the versatile camerawork & character interactions, and his input in front of the camera is just as neat. The film steadily builds towards its third act with an undercurrent of simmering tension until it all boils over the rim & spills on the surface. Strong performances from the cast add more credibility to the plot with Danny Aiello being a clear standout.Overall, Do the Right Thing is jam-packed with situations that could escalate into an all-out brawl at any given moment but by letting the racially charged unease to stack up till it nears its boiling point, Lee heightens our anticipation to a degree that makes the climax all the more powerful & hard-hitting. There's hardly anything controversial about it. It doesn't take any sides. It provides each character their own space. And it makes an essential plea for mutual understanding. In short, this Spike Lee joint is a definite recommend.",

I always thought it felt more 90s, but it was probably just ahead of its time or I was a few years late. Anyway enough of that, it's too hot for picky details. It's a scorcher y'see in Brooklyn. Sal (Danny Aiello) and his son Pino (John Turturro) own an Italian American pizza shop, have done for years (the ethnicity is important). The neighbourhood around them has changed though, now predominantly Black. It doesn't bother Sal, well not much. He's a proud man, hard working, happy with his place in the world. Pino though, like a lot of the cast is younger and more volatile. It might be a hot day, but this film is cool. Packed with a cast of cool characters. Realistic characters, serious, but fun, full of life. It feels like play, one carefully crafted set piece after another and it's bright! Loud and colourful, it really is a visual treat. Anyway back to Sal's. An unrecognisable Giancarlo Esposito, playing the brilliantly named Buggin' Out asks \"Why aren't there any brothers on the wall\" referencing Sal's photo collection 'Wall of Fame' featuring Italian Americans only. Mookie (Spike Lee), who works there smoothes things over after the inevitable argument, but it sets the tone. The whole thing is brilliantly soundtracked by a combination of DJ Samuel L Jackson broadcasting from the block and Radio Raheem a imposing lad who stalks the streets with the biggest boombox you've ever seen. Everything though has a sense of potential unrest. A fire hydrant fountain cooling kids off in the street, turns into an altercation with a very young looking Frank Vincent after getting his convertible soaked. There's jealousy over the successful Korean business on the corner and the volume of Kareem blasting out Public Enemy winding up those that aren't fans. They're undercurrents, signposting exactly where this is headed. This has to be one of the sweatiest films I can think of, the heat is rising and do the tensions. Everything works in harmony for a time, as long as everyone stays right where they are. It's a powder keg through, the smallest inconsequential events threatening to ignite the the fuse. That fuse is lit by the last person you'd expect, but the result is all too familiar. Riots and police brutality we've all sadly become so accustomed to. Friendships are abandoned in the heat of the moment and lives are destroyed. Lee paints a vivid picture, this put him on the map and although his subsequent films haven't always been great, when he hits the mark it's always worth a watch and over 3 decades on Do The Right Thing is more relevant than ever.",

The style of shooting, with a lot of low angles and wide close-ups, gave the film a nicely unique and extreme look, often echoing the moods of characters.

            "content": "Is DO THE RIGHT THING one of the few real masterpieces of American cinema to be made during the last few decades? Yep. Do the characters in the film represent heroes or role models? Nope.I've always been amused at some of the reactions this film has provoked, most of all the offense, which ignores a psychological component of DO THE RIGHT THING that remains ever present, though far off in the background: how pain and rage can obliterate logic and righteousness, propelling individuals with untapped intellect and creativity into fits of destructive, or self-destructive nihilism. It's rather silly to acknowledge what was inflicted upon African-Americans from the 16th century to (at least) the 1960s, then expect the same people to not carry collective rage and psychological scars after the passage of a few pieces of civil rights legislation. Expecting instant forgiveness (towards white legislative saviors) after 400+ years of every kind of degradation possible is laughable. This is not to justify wanton violence - but without understanding how history can affect psychology at both individual and collective levels, you're going to be utterly lost in this film.Seeing this process in action is where the real tension and greatness in DO THE RIGHT THING is to be found - I can't think of another film in existence that articulates this unconscious rage - a depressingly ubiquitous undercurrent in the American psyche that unfortunately seems permanent. I don't think anything shown in this film is justified or worthy of emulation, but that isn't the point. There is an underclass in urban America (not exclusively African-American either) that was written off by many in the wake of the rioting of the late 60s, and abandoned by the exodus to suburbia that also began in the 60s. This same underclass is told with increasing vehemence to shape up, prosper and restore communities that have had role models, money and intellect drained out of them in recent decades (and beaten out of them before). In such a setting, the intelligence and energy of whoever is still around will come into conflict with their own anger, resentment and confusion, and within this setting nihilism, frontier justice of a variety and self-destruction almost start to seem sensible.As an anti-heroic film, DO THE RIGHT THING fits comfortably into the tradition of THE WILD BUNCH, BONNIE & CLYDE or A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. As with those films, the viewer has to acknowledge the humanity and disoriented intelligence of the characters, especially when confronted with their lack of nobility. Stark and raw, viewers could easily be put off by the location of this antiheroic drama in an inner city, but this is far closer to truth - for better or worse - than any bleeding-heart Hollywood credit-to-one's-race fluff. A brilliant, complex and very subtle film if you bother to look below the surface.",

In one hot day in Brooklyn, New York, The lives of several diverse characters will be changed forever when prejudice, ignorance and violence rear their ugly heads once again.One of the best things about the movie is the characters. It's incredible how Lee was able to balance so many characters, some more important then others, and make them all interesting. I cared about every person in this neighborhood and where life would lead them. That is good writing. Despite the serious subject matter of racism and police brutality, the film is shockingly funny.

As if it is also a player in this story. I adore the cinematography here. I love the funky angles and dramatic close ups scattered throughout. The editing is quick and sleek. The screenplay has to be one of the best ever written.The only truly bad thing about Do the Right Thing is how relevant it still is. I can't believe what happened to Radio Raheem still happens now.

            "content": "Do The Right Thing is a controversial movie dealing with the issue of racism in the course of living in America. It is amazing as to how Lee managed to deal with this issue while remaining extremely fair. This is a movie that demands to be heard. It does not tell the audience what they should think. It just shows the audience what is happening.The entire film was shot on location in Bedford-Stuyevesant because Lee felt that was the only way he could capture the entire atmosphere. However, unlike most movies, that portray this place the optimum for guns, drugs and violence, Lee brings depth to this place. People live here. It is a 'neighborhood' just like any other. We see the whole neighborhood filled with character that live here and go about their daily lives. There is Mookie, who works as Sal's pizza delivery boy. There is Radio Raheem, who wanders about the neighborhood. There is life in this place. There is a sense of community here where people know one another and accept one another. Though it all, we do get to see raising tensions of disturbance. However, when it explodes by the burning of Sal's livelihood, we just cannot accept it. After all, is this not a close knitted neighborhood, where everyone lives in harmony with each other not counting their skin color? This in turn brings realism and we are compelled to note that in the midst of the slums, there is life \u0096in or out of the film. Lee practically throws the ball at us. At the end of the day, yes this might be a movie but this is what is really happening in Bedford.All the characters are to be empathized and Lee does not take sides, but simply looked with sadness as how the events cut the heart of the community with the burning of Sal's pizzeria. What is interesting to note is that there is no 'bad' guy in this movie. Everyone has good and bad qualities and we come to understand what motivates them, even though we do not always agree with them. This I feel is what makes Lee's movie brilliant as he manages to make us sympathize with every character when the build up of racism finally explodes. For some reason, this movie reminds me of another Lee \u0096 Harper Lee, the author of To Kill a Mockingbird, as to me, this movie has the same feel of it. Lee brings the all the main characters together by their strengths and weaknesses and we cannot judge them \u0096 they are shades of gray. We cannot directly point at any of them as the root cause of the burning of Sal's place as one event leads to a reaction. When the police kill Raheem, Mookie reacts by throwing the trashcan into Sal's window. Everyone is to be blamed but what makes this a compelling watch is we can understand why they reacted in a particular manner and come to feel their anguish.At the opening credits, we are greeted by the tune of \"Fight the Power\" by Public Enemy. This becomes the film's signature tune and is but a hint of the future that is in store. We see Radio Raheem walking with his boom box to this tune most of the time. We see his steel knuckles that spells out \"love\" and \"hate\" and he stages a mock play for Mookie. However, this is really ironical as when his boom box is smashed by Sal, all Raheem sees is hate. He just wants to lash out at Sal. However, we cannot blame him entirely, as we can clearly see, he have been provoked. Lee shows us that love does not win over hate. After all, love and hate are but a paper thin line and we the audience can only wash in dismay as everyone seems so filled with hate burning down Sal's place. As the saying goes, it only takes one to start the fire. Regret, comes later.Do The Right Thing, shows people doing the wrong thing. At the end of the movie are no answers. None of the people we meet are perfect. However, what makes this a gripping watch is the way Lee makes us emphasize with them. We see racism as it is \u0096 an ugly act done by normal people who are not perfect. What Lee does here is not to judge them but to show why it happens.During the closing credits, we see are given a glimpse of Martin Luther's dream \u0096 for all man to be equal. And that is what Lee is trying to tell the audience. Racism happens, but we are the ones responsible for it. This is one movie that leaves the audience with something to think about as we cannot fully fault anyone in this movie for the finale explosion of racism which is depicted in the burning down of Sal's place as everything is but a chain of reactions.",

After first watching Do The Right Thing, I felt obliged to see it more. The premise is very weak and there's no real plot. But Lee wanted it that way and uses it to his advantage. It appears to be about nothing, but as time progresses, you may be caught off guard and blown away.Do The Right Thing takes place one boiling afternoon in a mostly black Brooklyn neighbourhood. There's a few connecting stories that all deal with racism in some form or another. Funny thing is, all of the stories with the characters are so meaningless and shallow. I knew Lee wanted to be real, but real is often boring. But nonetheless, the characters themselves are quite quirky. Lee plays Mookie who works in an Italian pizzeria where he must deal with his pushy boss (Aiello), his boss's son, and his own girlfriend and kid; Da Mayor is an old drunk who just wants peace. He is the one I like the most and the only one who \"does the right thing\" in a part of the film without any analyzing; Buggin' Out is a weird looking thug who want's the pizzeria to have African-Americans on the wall instead of famous Italian Americans like John Travolta and Frank Sinatra; a trio of middle-aged men complain about what the neighbourhood has come to; Smiley is mentally challenged and tries to sell photos of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. The dude that plays Smiley does and terrible job of acting and I just want to punch my TV every time he comes on.Each of these little stories have been going on for quite some time and they are pretty low-key when we are introduced to them. In fact, they are so low that they are almost uninteresting. The stories are dull, but the characters aren't. That doesn't last long. Simple tensions in these groups just keep growing and growing into an ending that will leave you completely breathless. It wasn't until about halfway through where I was becoming more compelled with what was happening. But I could not deny how awesome the dialogue was and how great the general filming was. Even when I wasn't very interested, Lee's talent as a filmmaker did not go unrecognized.Lee wanted to show how such small things could have such huge and tragic results. The movie is a statement about racism, violence, misleadings, and loyalty. Everything in this movie is pure art from the creation of the look to the messages. My first watch was an experience I'll never forget. I have seen Do The Right Thing a few times, and I am glad that I now know its idea of little things boiling.I mentioned one character that \"does the right thing.\" But the viewer is left to decide if anybody else in this movie \"does the right thing.\"4/4",

Italian Sal (Danny Aiello, who received an Oscar nomination for this role) together with his sons: racist Pino (John Turturro) and well-meaning naive Vito (Richard Edson) open up their pizzeria, the dining epicentre of the district. Mookie (Spike Lee), working as a delivery guy, has little regard for time or responsibilities, including taking care of his fianc\u00e9e Tina (Rosie Perez) or their child. Amongst other inhabitants of the colourful and vibrant area are boombox and Public Enemy fanatic Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn), machine-gun wisecracking radio entertainer Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy (Samuel L. Jackson), the benign Mother Sister (Ruby Dee) and hobo mentor living in inner-peace Da Mayor (Ossie Davis). This day however will be no ordinary day, as lives entertwine and cause an ultimate culmination of ideas and conflicts.\"Do the Right Thing\" Spike Lee's pivotal movie, which torpedoed him to from being 'just another Afroamerican director' to one of the most awaited voices of American cinema. Internally contradictory, as summarised by Lee himself just before the end credits, where both Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr are quoted from opposing spectrums of the debate. Although both respected each other one advocated a Gandhi-like revolution, while the other spoke on behalf of aggressive self-defence. These two ideas chaotically collide, collage, cooperate and deviate throughout the movie, as Spike Lee seems to ask the essential question, but offers not didactic response: What is the right thing? The character of Mookie is the bystander, who takes in the varying points of view to ultimately deliver a non-committal response by saving Sal from a mob through initiating an attack on his pizzeria. In this moment voices of reason collapse and ideals take a back seat for pure mob mentality. This action is compulsive and non-directed, much due to the fact that the community is not united behind a common idea, but split between opposing concepts (each character basically has his own set of beliefs). At the same time this action triggers a more profound social commentary - why is so much attention placed on the burning down of the white-owned pizzeria, but so little to the death of Radio Raheem which initiated these events?The movie itself is also severely based on the mood. Unlike the majority of filmmakers Brooklyn here is zesty, colourful, full of ideas, music and thoughts, showing that the community has the ingredients for success. However the relentless scorn of the sun leaves the population devoid of action, without strength to react or initiate, so the characters mostly talk about revolution and change, but fail to follow through on their own words. The fact that heat is an outside force does seem to suggest that this state of affairs is caused by outside influence, but Spike Lee also points out (mostly through a conversation between three wise bums) that although the situation did come into place through external forces, it can not be used as a permanent excuse for inaction. Ripe with contradictions each character also deserves a separate analysis as to his meaning, mindset and purpose, such as the jobless slacker who attacks Mayor for not working (sic!).A multilayered, but also witty comedy, which is the mantelpiece of Spike Lee's illustrious career, remains a powerful and unflinchingly relevant piece on race relations, despite occasionely being dated.",

I may agree some scenes are quite entertaining and you can identify yourself with one character or another, but hey that's basically what all movies need to work. One thing I didn't enjoy was the characters talking bad words to each other all the time, I can't believe there's a neighborhood like that. People don't seem to have any respect for each other-- and that's a sad thing. Spike Lee's character is the only one well developed, even thought it's hard to sympathize with him.

            "content": "Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing\" is considered a modern classic by many. Set on the hottest day of the year in the Bed-Stuy neighbourhood of Brooklyn, the film follows several individuals throughout the day as racial tensions become increasingly strained. The story that unfolds ends up being both explosive and thought-provoking.I'll begin by saying that the cast is nothing short of spectacular. Danny Aiello's strong performance was recognized with one of the film's two Oscar nominations but a load of other fine performances were overlooked. For starters, you've got John Turturro, Spike Lee, Giancarlo Esposito, Rosie Perez, Ossie Davis & Ruby Dee. When you consider some of the smaller roles you've got people like Samuel L. Jackson, John Savage, Frank Vincent & Bill Nunn. An enviable cast, to say the least.Spike Lee's script resulted in the film's other Oscar nomination and, while that recognition was well deserved, I'm surprised that his direction didn't receive the same distinction. Even more shocking is the fact that Ernest Dickinson's vibrant cinematography wasn't nominated either. Musically, I didn't care much for Bill Lee's score but the soundtrack selections fared better, especially Public Enemy's classic \"Fight the Power\", which was used extensively.Overall, \"Do the Right Thing\" delivers in all areas. The acting is first-rate, the visuals are attractive and the story packs a punch. I know that some might balk at watching a movie with a message (ambiguous though it may be) but this one is well worth the effort.",

            "content": "Leave it to Spike Lee to voice what many had been thinking, but few had the courage to say. In response to media reports of racially motivated violence, the up and coming filmmaker penned Do the Right Thing, a heated commentary on the racism inherent in our society, and the 'fight or flight' response triggered as consequence (and in the eyes of Lee, the former seems the much more likely option). And there can be little doubt that while Lee's narrative may function as a story, (a political microcosm of the state of society; albeit a very dark outlook) it was primarily intended as a sort of rallying cry - for oppressed racial minorities to stand up and take back their dignity, by force if necessary (Lee's underhanded advocating of violence as retribution is one of the film's more disconcerting traits). The film consistently carries such a fervent tone throughout, as if meant to double as a speech at a political rally. Lee writes with a fierce passion, seemingly tailored to create controversy and raise an uproar - which of course the film did, when released in the heat of such hate crimes in the late 1980s (Lee raised a few eyebrows when he encouraged African American high school students to skip school to go see his film, claiming it was more important).Visually, Do the Right Thing also boasts a style all of its own, with such a collection of bright colours, primarily red, smeared across nearly all the sets and character's costumes. Combined with the distinctly crafted appearances of the characters (flat top haircuts, bug- eyed glasses, colourful t-shirts and those infamous brass knuckles) and cinematographer Ernest Dickenson's edgy, off center camera angles, the film resembles a moving comic book, which fits the film's motif of being not quite reality, but near enough to serve as a precautionary message. The larger than life characters strut through a larger than life society, tensions high as a powder keg due to the immense heat, all accompanied by the pounding strains of Public Enemy's 'Fight the Power', and Lee's own father Bill's jazzy riffs. And Lee's powder keg doesn't just go off - the film gives the impression of actually exploding in a blast of erupting testimonies, vivid colours and crashing music. One might describe it as the cinematic equivalent of being tear gassed at a rally - the comparison hardly seems far off.However politically motivated his story may be, Lee proves an expert at crafting vivid and memorable characters, both visually and by their words and actions. However larger than life the characters may be, they carry an essence of truth, making some of the more incredulous plot points all the more poignant. Lee's cast rises to the occasion, and while few performances prove award worthy, the cast should be unanimously applauded for their collective intensity and for proving so memorable. Danny Aiello is a strong presence in the role of Sal, the pizzeria owner, and it sounds like off camera Aiello did an even greater service to his character, convincing Lee to rewrite Sal from simply being a racist bigot to a conflicted but ultimately caring man with demons of his own. (it would have been interesting to see what Robert De Niro, Lee's first choice, would have done with the role) Character actor Ossie Davis is superb as the gentle and compassionate town drunk, self billed as \"Da Mayor\", one of the film's few morally sound characters. Spike Lee himself does a good job as Mookie, the film's central character, though one can't help but wonder if there might have been a more established actor who might have been stronger in the part. Giancarlo Eposito is a high point as the volatile \"Buggin' Out\", and John Turturro stands out as Sal's abrasive older son. The perfectly cast Bill Nunn is unforgettable as the rage filled Radio Raheem, obsessed with blaring Public Enemy on his boom box at full volume at all times to show his defiance for society. Nunn incites such frustration and anger in the audience that it isn't until after the film finishes it becomes clear how effective he was in the role. Watch also for a brilliant early Samuel L. Jackson, one of the film's highlights, as the 'voice of reason' figure - DJ \"Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy\". Do the Right Thing is one of those films that, no matter how hard you might try to leave it behind, remains pounding around the skull for quite a while afterwards. While the film's political stance can hardly be considered even handed, Lee's fiercely heated vision and vivid, highly memorable array of characters feel nearly enough to make audiences jump up and shout. Lee ends his film with two quotes: one from Martin Luther King, advising peace as the only solution to racial discrimination; and one from Malcolm X, supporting violence as justified and the only way of evoking change. Which, Lee needles, is the right thing? And it's a question that stands, to this day. -8/10",

A modern masterpiece that gets better every time that you watch it. This film gets people thinking and it's guaranteed that once you are finished watching it (for the first time or for the 100th time), you will talk about it and form your own opinion on \"WHO DID THE RIGHT THING?\". Not many movies can have such an effect on people's thoughts of morality and the social issues of our modern society as this movie. Every performance was excellent. The direction was good (the movie knew where it was going and how it was going to get there). The viewer gets to know the characters very well. There's the italians who run the pizza shop: Sal and his 2 sons Pino, the racist one, and Vito, the non-racist one. The koreans across the street in the market who are irritated with the black clientelle and vise versa. The hispanics. The 3 black men under the umbrella down on the corner. Buggin' Out, the troublemaker who starts it all. Radio Raheem carrying his boom box all around the neighborhood playing the same song...\"Fight The Power\". Smily, the retarded man, carrying around pictures of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. Da Mayor, the nighborhood drunk, Mr. Senor Love Daddy, the DJ at the neighborhood radio station \"WELOVE 108.FM\", and Mookie (played to perfection by Spike Lee), the pizza delivery boy who work's at \"Sal's Famous Pizzeria\" and is caught up in all of the daily events but is finally forced to choose sides due to racial tensions. Everyone hates everyone. I liked how Spike Lee showed racism from all sides instead of stereotyping the racism in favor of whites or blacks. The racism is spread out equally and you can clearly see and understand every character's point of view and the reasons for doing what they do. The question is....\"Who Did The Right Thing\"? The climax is amazingly realistic and utterly brilliant. Decide for yourself who did the right thing. The film's theme is both anti-racist and anti-violent. Spike Lee's greatest work! Another film that gets the anti-racist point across is \"American History X\", but is not as effective because it shows racism from only one side (the whites) and \"Do The Right Thing\" shows racism from all sides, even hatred towards the same race. Spike Lee made another film about the lives of people in a particular neighborhood in New York City....That film was called \"Summer Of Sam\" but it's stereotypical and boring... Nothing like this. \"Summer Of Sam\" gets a 1 out of 10 but \"Do The Right thing\" gets a 10 out of 10! Excellent! See it!",

And in Spike Lee's seminal 1989 slice of life drama \"Do the Right Thing,\" Lee forces us to ask ourselves what exactly that right thing is.Lee plays the main character, Mookie, as he struggles through inner-city life working for a somewhat racist Italian pizza shoppe owner. When an altercation at the pizza place leads to a death of Mookie's friend, and racial tensions rise, Mookie is left with no choice but to start destroying the pizza place, lest the angry mob turns their hatred towards the actual owners.In that space, Lee challenges us to wonder if what Mookie does is right. The film itself portrays the in-your-face nature of an entropic urban project, complete with homages to 80's rap videos of the day and graffiti of the town's one and only hero, Mike Tyson. That in it of itself should explain what's wrong with the town, but Lee challenges us to look further than surface level.And that's what this film does so well, is make you believe that this is almost a documentary, not a stylized film.

It's an age old question that is as relevant today as in any other time period. It's the question Spike Lee's masterpiece, Do the Right Thing, tackles boldly, albeit harshly. Do the Right Thing takes place on a swelter summer day in a primarily black neighborhood in Brooklyn. The day begins peaceful enough, but tensions flare and tempers rise as the day gets hotter and more uncomfortable. The film presents a colorful clash of characters that move through a series of seemingly trivial matters throughout the day, all building towards the violent boiling point where the racial tension shatters and chaos erupts. It's a visually electric film with a story so ingeniously woven, full of characters so beautifully crafted. This film has changed the face of racial tension in film by being overtly powerful and shockingly compelling.This isn't a film that demonizes one particular side of the race war. It doesn't take a side and it tells its story from multiple perspectives. It digs down deep into the tension and examines a close group of characters to the fullest extent. It may seem like the white people in this film are the villains, those who cause all the problems and all the trouble, but when compared to the black people in the film we learn that we're all cut from the same flawed and troubled cloth. Nobody is all good, but nobody is all bad either. Do the Right Thing levels the playing field and aims to give the world a reality check. It's not all black and white out there, and the film throws this in our face, even in the way the film is designed with its bright neon colors that contrast with one another and make everything in this backwards Brooklyn neighborhood pop out. Here's a film that displays multi leveled storytelling at its finest, never faltering and getting its point across very well.The great thing about this film is that it doesn't preach to us even thought it has such a strong message. It has action, it has excitement, it has an eloquently human side to it that makes it all the more compelling. Do the Right Thing is an illustrious film with lots of bells and whistles in the form of quirky characters and wild situations. The incredible thing about this film, however, is how it pulls all of these quirks and nuances together to paint its bigger picture. There is all kinds of symbolism here that Lee employs through his stylistic camera work and his moody and powerful script. Do the Right Thing is a film that works on so many levels, and I plan on seeing it multiple times so as to collect all of the brilliance it has to offer. This is an incredibly well made, incredibly important film that is an absolute must see.",

And Spike Lee did a good job of capturing what its like to be a black man, especially living in the streets of NYC. I thought it was a powerful message to have at the very beginning of the movie the video of Rodney King being beaten by cops, which cop brutality is an issue we are still dealing with. I noticed that the colors of the film were mostly yellow and red, maybe as a symbol of the power that the white man has. In the movie the cops kill Mookie's friend in the middle of a brawl, and as the one cop is restraining Mookies friend, he is choking him to death with his club. The other cop even kept yelling at the cop to stop because he could see the kid was about to die, but the cop didn't care and continued. So they just throw him the back of the car. This of course made Mookie and the rest of the crowd very angry at the police Mookie decided to pick up a trash can and throw it threw Sal's window which caused the rest of the crowd to start breaking everything and set the place on fire. I don't think Mookie should have done this because violence just creates more violence and nothing gets solved but things get damaged and people get hurt. I don't think the two boys in the film should have gone up to Sal in the first place, they have no right to demand anything when it is his store. They knew they were trying to start something and did. Watching this movie and watching movies like this, the only reaction I seem to get is anger.

Spike Lee and Oliver Stone get the biggest flack from a lot of critics, I can see why real easy...Lee is focused on one dominant topic in his work: race.  Stone is more varied.  They both suffer from frequent dryspells and insufficient work, but Stone doesn't try consistently hammering a similar point over and over. Therefore, if I had to say \"watch one Spike Lee joint\", this would be it.Do the Right Thing transports the social problems of Salem into urban America on the low-level community scene where they previously dominated. Between race war, class war, pride war, heritage war, authority war, domestic war, the movie is a molotov cocktail ready to blow sky-high.Yet there's something more unsettling about it and that's how Lee tries infusing humor, thus contradicting his efforts.  Waiting until the end to make his point is not effective filmmaking.  The acting itself ranges from animated caricatures to the \"real thing\".

Except for Ossie Davis, who goes by \"Da Mayor\" and is a very thoughtful, reasonable character, all the others are caricatures. They are always angry, they shout at each other, normal conversation is almost completely absent. The language is filthy, it seems Spike Lee's main vocabulary is \"Muther-F this\" and \"Muther-F that\", or just filling dialog with the \"F-word.\" To the point that it just becomes noise and all meaning shuts down.The concept is good, on a very hot day in Brooklyn, an area where whites, black, Asians, and police all must interact, bigotry and prejudice eventually gets the best of everybody and violence is the result.

From the moment Rosie Perez dances to Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\" during one of the greatest opening credits role ever, all the way to the incendiary scenes at the end, this is a film loaded with indelible images and meaning.The film shows us racial tension in everything from countless microagressions to loud and very blunt comments, each of which you might think would lead to violence, but which is all just a part of this community (though eventually the lid boils over). It's packed with references, e.g. The 'Tawana told the truth!' graffiti and the long list of musical artists the DJ rattles off, and then of course the scene of excessive lethal force used by the police, which was decades ahead of its time in terms of calling attention to a systemic (and horrifying) problem.Spike Lee's writing and direction in this is excellent. He evokes the atmosphere of the Bed-Stuy neighborhood of Brooklyn in the sweltering heat. He uses tilted camera angles and close-ups to amplify emotion. He lets actors communicate with their eyes, such as the scene where the white cops drive by the three middle-aged black guys talking on the sidewalk and they eye each other, or the scene where Spike Lee and John Turturro's characters watch the latter's father (Danny Aiello) flirt with his sister (Joie Lee, Spike's real-life sister) - both of which are fantastic.There are lots of other great moments, such as Turturro's character struggling to explain why the black athletes and celebrities he admires are somehow 'not black' or different from the African-Americans he sees around the neighborhood, and later the conversation he has with his more tolerant father. It's a great set of characters, most of which have a lot of nuance to them, and an excellent cast. And bless Ossie Davis in this movie, his character is so fantastic (\"If we don't stop this and stop it now, we're going to do something we regret for the rest of our lives!\"), and I loved seeing his moments with Ruby Dee, who has a great scene herself when she laments the destruction.The film toes the line of advocating violence, but ultimately I don't think it does so. I think Lee was simply trying to explain why it happens, and giving us a little education to go along with the entertainment. I think he's saying the titular \"Right Thing\" (or the ideal thing anyway) is always peace, but it becomes next to impossible to do that when your neck is being stomped on. The quotes from Martin Luther King and Malcolm X at the end were a brilliant way of showing this, and to me reflect two sides of the same coin. This is a great film, and one I think which will rise even more in appreciation for what it stands for as the years pass.",

            "content": "This movie takes place in Brooklyn, New York and Director Spike Lee did a great job of showing racial tensions and stereotypes in this movie. Spike Lee is cast in this movie as a delivery employee (Mookie), who works at Sal's Famous Pizzeria. Sal and his two sons run the pizzeria in a neighborhood that Is made up of mostly African American and Hispanic residents. Lee does a great job of showing how racial tensions can explode into violence when an African American character (Buggin out\"), who appears to be socially conscious of the neighborhood and its makeup questions Sal about all the photographs of Italian Americans on the wall of his pizzeria.The point is made by \"Buggin\" that most of Sal's customers who provide Sal with income, are African American and that Sal should display photos of prominent African Americans on the wall of his pizzeria. Sal, not surprisingly voices his position that he will display whatever photos he chooses because it is his establishment. From that point, the movie shows stereotypes of the various racial makeups of the neighbor and New York City generally. There is a scene in the movie where racial slurs are spoken by various characters right into the camera that is both funny and highlight the biases that each race has and how they see other ethnic cultures. I thought this movie did an excellent job of showing how racial biases can escalate into a riot and a tragedy because the people in the neighborhood did not approach the situation in a calm and reasonable way and instead, let their biases and anger control their thinking and conduct.",

It just makes you think what an amazing film maker/storyteller he is and 'Do the right thing' is a perfect example of that. This is such a powerful movie and is probably the best when it comes to the subject of racial tension between whites and blacks living in the same neighbourhood, the acting is also amazing even when it was the roles of newcomers such as Martin Lawrence,Rosie Perez and even Sam Jackson.But my favourite is still Bill Nunn who plays the ultra cool 'Radio Raheem'.Amazing.10 out 10.",

            "content": "Realizing I had never seen any of Spike Lee's movies, we put this on last night and were mesmerized. I had no idea. This is a masterpiece of a movie on so many levels and viewpoints that it was kind of overwhelming. Incredible actors and acting, cinematography, directing, editing, sound...it haunted my dreams last night, and continues to haunt me today. By \"haunt\", let me be clear that I mean the lingering presence of a life experience that was so rich and complex that your overwhelmed subconscious mind continues to process it long after the experience, seeking deeper comprehension, meaning, and answers. Not only was watching this film such an experience, but it was a technical masterpiece as well.In the interest of no-spoilers, I will try to summarize what I think is important to say with care. Having read a bunch of online reactions of others to the movie already, I must say that like any good work of art, what you see in this film is what you want to see, biased by your preconceptions and life experiences. That is, in my opinion, the genius of this film. My ongoing subconscious yearnings for a bottom line, a moral lesson or meaning from this film, are doomed to end up unsatisfied in the end, because I don't think it exists. I don't think Spike Lee actually has an angle, a bias, or a lesson, other than \"do the right thing\", a simple reflection of the reality that consequences derive only from choices made, and that in choice alone lies morality, truth, and the power to affect a future outcome. Every individual choice--good or evil--writes the story of the future.In this film, Spike Lee creates a vibrantly colored cinematic tapestry of life in a single 24 hour period on a single street. Within this tapestry he weaves a set of interlocking worlds containing stories of many detailed characters, each with their own backgrounds and troubles, each with their own hopes and aspirations, and each with their own struggles to survive in this microcosm that is their view of the world. Yet, these worlds all coexist on the same street, and as they overlap and collide there is both harmony and friction, there must be give and take.Many say this film is about racism, but that is a colossal oversimplification. It's about human beings, who can be classified through genetics or culture in a multitude of ways: ethnicity and race, gender, parent or child, husband or wife, rich and poor, store owner and customer, spoken language, musical taste, mental health, disabilities, vices, or authority and power. In this movie, on a single day in a single place, we see through the lens of Spike Lee every single one of these facets of humanity play out in a struggle between harmony and conflict--between love and hate.As my brain continues to struggle to find a clear punchline, a clear meaning, even a clear sense of what was right and what was wrong in this vivid story, I can only come to one conclusion: Spike Lee doesn't have a punchline, he only paints a picture to illustrate the human problem. In this picture lies the problem posed by the human condition, that we must always live amongst each other amid differences and conflicts and competition, and that even when we think we are doing a great job at this 99.9% of the time, life eventually presents us with a moment of split decision where our choices can have enormous consequences. Good versus Evil. The choice will never look as clear as those words imply, all we can attempt is to do the right thing.Thank you Spike Lee, this film should have won multiple Oscars, and I can't wait to catch up on all your work which I embarrassingly have missed until now.",

            "content": "Film-making is a tough & competitive business with directors following Hollywood movie-making protocols in order to stay busy. One director/writer dares to defy Hollywood standards of film-making like none other, and that man is Spike Lee. Lee's prior films such as \"Mo' Better Blues\" & \"School Daze\" have transcended the usual methods of movie-making by using unorthodox camera angles, derogatory racial slang, & elusive story lines/topics/messages as well as race relations in America. No other director has tackled the issue of race relations in America & the Black consciousness better, more accurate, or with more conviction than Lee. \"Do the Right Thing\" challenges the notion that no matter where you live or who you are, we all have preconceived notions about each other in terms of race & ethnicity. And at any given moment under certain circumstances, racial tension can erupt with only dire consequences to follow. The film centers around the Bedford-Styvesant section of Brooklyn on the hottest day of the summer. On a corner in the middle of the neighborhood stands Sal's Famous pizzeria, owned & operated by Italian-American Sal(Danny Aiello) & sons Pito(john Turturro) & Vito(Richard Edson). For more than 20 years, Sal has made his delicious Italian-American food for many of the neighborhood's residents to his satisfaction. Sal is content with where he does business & wants no troubles. Unlike his father, Pino hates the pizzeria & is prejudiced towards Blacks & Hispanics. Pino's ire is further bolstered because of pizzeria deliveryman & deadbeat father Mookie(Lee). Mookie, well known in the 'hood, goes about his day always looking to \"get paid\". Mookie isn't so popular with girlfriend Tina(Rosie Perez) who cares for their young son Hector, who Mookie rarely sees or supplies support to. On top of that, Mookie lives with responsible & socially conscience younger sister Jade(Joie Lee) who constantly reminds Mookie to \"take care of his responsibilities\" & be a man. As the film marches on & the mercury rises to very uncomfortable levels, racial tensions begin to bubble. Incidents upon incidents begin to occur. In the midst of the burgeoning tensions, a lonely & drunken old man called Da' Mayor(the late Ozzie Davis) tries to win over stern & cynical matriarch Mother Sista(real life spouse Ruby Dee) in a quirky kind of love between the two. Neighborhood lackeys ML(Paul Benjamin), Coconut Sid(Frankie Faison), & \"Sweet Dick\" Willie(the late comic Robin Harris) complain about new immigrants to the area have better opportunities to succeed while Blacks like themselves continue to struggle to make ends meet. Local youth cause mischief, city police make reluctant rounds, & Sal endures run-ins with neighborhood tough \"Radio\" Raheem(Bill Nunn) & loud mouth Buggin Out(Giancarlo Esposito). Enraged by the failure of Sal to put Blacks as well as Italian-Americans on his pizzeria's \"Wall of Fame\", Buggin' Out calls for a boycott of Sal's Famous. With \"Radio Raheem at his side, Buggin' Out storms into Sal's Famous. When Sal destroys \"Radio\" Raheem's boom box, a major fistfight ensues & starts an all out riot that spills into the streets. City police & fire arrive on the scene to quell the madness. In the process of apprehending \"Radio\" Raheem, police apply a choke hold too tight & strangle the neighborhood tough. Realizing \"Radio\" Raheem has been murdered, the resident youth converge on Sal's Famous to loot, destroy, & set it ablaze. The carnage affects everyone present, especially Mookie. The following day Mookie returns to Sal's Famous to collect his final pay. Angrily, Sal pays Mookie & inquires what his former employee plans to do. Mookie states that he is on his way to visit with his son & find a new way to \"get paid\".Check out a young Martin Lawrence who plays a minor role along with a supporting cast of relatively unknowns. Call this film what you will. Judge it on it's merits or lack thereof. One thing cannot be denied; this movie makes you take a long, hard look at race relations in America & its ever presence in our society, no matter how shallow or how deep you believe racial prejudice to exist in our everyday lives. Lee's methods are \"in your face\" & controversial to say the least but nonetheless effective, if you take the time to pay attention. Check it out, even if just to satisfy your curiosity. I give it a 7 out of 10 with one thumb up!!!",

Giancarlo Esposito as the flaky Buggin Out was utterly uproarious and Danny Aiello was the very endearing Italian pizza chef Sal who scrabbled not to give in to his eldest son, played by a young and talented John Turturro.

            "content": "Do The Right Thing is an excellent,powerful and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema and one of the greatest films ever made that mixes amazing direction,a great cast,a fantastic script,an outstanding score and soundtrack and beautiful cinematography and is filmmaking and Spike Lee at their best.Set in the neighborhood section of Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn,New York,Do The Right Thing tells the story of a local neighborhood and people that have to deal with racial tensions and hate on the hottest day of the Summer that explodes in violence and leads to tragedy,mayhem and chaos.Released in the Summer of 1989,Do The Right Thing is the brilliant and powerful Masterpiece that introduced the world to director Spike Lee. Although Lee had made a splash with his first two great films the Romantic Comedy-Drama She's Gotta Have It and the funny College Comedy-Drama-Musical School Daze,Do The Right Thing in my opinion was his first real breakthrough and even though Spike Lee has made many great and truly wonderful films since none of his other films(with the exception of Lee's other Masterpiece Malcolm X) have left an amazing and powerful impression on viewers like Do The Right Thing had. Right from the opening credits Do The Right Thing pulls you into an amazing unforgettable cinematic experience that keeps you glued to the screen with great intensity and fiery. It's a movie that is very realistic and stylish,funny and tragic,thoughtful and observant,raw and in your face as well as movie that grabs you by the throat and never lets go until the very end. Also Do The Right Thing maybe one of the best and greatest if not the best and greatest film about race and racism in America and with DTRT Spike Lee gives viewers and examination of Racism why most human beings are Racist and Lee doesn't sugarcoat anything and just approaches the Racism with realism and no race or ethnicity in the film Blacks,Whites,Hispanics and Asians goes unscathed. Lee has talked about race in most of his other films and in his other films they were very thought-provoking but DTRT is his most powerful film about race. The talks of Race and Racism is powerful and frank and will leave an great impression on viewers because the themes of racism is timeless. Each of the main characters in the film are real and are very complex and multidimensional and aren't stereotypes but the kind characters that we see in real life and just like in real life there are flesh and true life characters in the film that are likable and unlikable but stay with you after the film is over. What I also love about the film is the fact that DTRT takes place over the course of one day and hot weather and temperature. I love films that take place in one day or in 24 hours and DTRT gives viewers a day in the life in a Brooklyn,New York section neighborhood showing the characters doing regular everyday things but it is slightly distorted with tension in the air and the Hot weather adds to the tension. The 100 plus degree Weather is an accurate representation of not only Heat but the tension among the film's main characters that is boiling and ready to explode like a bomb and it is not the sweat or the heat but with violence and harsh language and Spike Lee puts the high level tension to the forefront and brings it out and never lets up. The beautiful cinematography by Ernest Dickerson is amazing and stylish with Ernest Dickerson making the hot sunlight and heat look great to look at with close ups and weird,tilted angles with amazing visuals making the different colors and styles come off the screen. The screenplay by Spike Lee is very masterful and well-written with Lee giving the characters memorable dialog that is harsh and true to life and each of the main characters come to life thanks to Lee's great uncompromising script. The ending or final 30 minutes of the film is one of the greatest and most unforgettable endings in film history and is an ending that greatly doesn't answer any questions and will cause for a lot of debates with no clear or easy conclusions with Lee letting the viewers make up their own minds. An amazing and powerful ending.The whole cast is amazing. Danny Aiello is excellent as Sal,the local pizzeria owner. Ossie Davis is brilliant as Da Mayor,a drunk with words of wisdom. Ruby Dee is fantastic as Mother Sister,an old woman who watches the entire neighborhood and has great scenes with Davis. John Turturro and Richard Edsen are amazing as Sal's sons Pino,Sal's oldest son who's racist against Blacks and Vito,Sal's youngest who likes Blacks. Giancarlo Esposito is outstanding and over the top as Buggin' Out,a guy protesting Sal's. Spike Lee is great as Mookie,Sal's Pizza delivery guy Bill Nunn is wonderful and iconic as Radio Raheem,a young man who loves his Radio. Paul Benjamin(ML),Franie Faison(Coconut Sid),Robin Harris(Sweet Dick Willie),Rosie Perez(Tina),Joie Lee(Jade),Samuel L. Jackson(Mr. Senor Love Daddy),Miguel Sandoval(Officer Ponte),Rick Aiello(Officer Long),Roger Guenveur Smith(Smiley),Steve White(Ahmad),Martin Lawerence(Cee)Leonard Thomas(Punchy)Christa Rivers(Ella),Steve Park(Sonny),Lois Ramos(Stevie),Frank Vincent(Charlie)and John Savage(Clifton)give good performances as well.The direction by Spike Lee is brilliant and stylish,with Lee always moving the camera and giving the film a beautiful visual style with tilted angles and close-ups. Great direction,Lee.The score by Bill Lee is excellent,powerful,sad and memorable and adds to the film's tone. A wonderful score by Bill Lee. The film has a great soundtrack with songs by Public Enemy(the classic Do The Right Thing Theme Song Fight The Power),Al Jarreau(Never Explain Love),Perri(Feel So Good),Ruben Blades(Tu y Yo),Steel Pulse(Can't Stand It),Teddy Riley Featuring Guy(My Fantasy)and more. Great soundtrack.In final word,if you love Spike Lee,Dramas,or films in general,I highly suggest you see Do The Right Thing,an excellent,brilliant,flawless and unforgettable masterpiece of cinema that will stay with you after you watch it and belongs in every film lovers collection. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",

            "content": "Leni Riefenstahi's biographer once complained about his inability to disconnect himself from the subject of his analysis, complaining that Riefenstahi \"did to my slumber what her fuehrer did to Poland\". Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing cannot be said to have such a powerful impact that it disturbs the dreams of its viewers but there is a rare power in the film that disturbs the mind. Therefore the film needs to be understood by emphasizing the viewer's role in the creation of meaning and the director's responsibility in guiding the audience in that process.The magnificence of the film is in the manner that Lee fashioned a realistic urban world populated with memorable characters and then allowed it to explode due to the irrationality of racial tension. This world is not an Eden but the viewer sees it in a healthy and functional condition that adds to the sadness at the end when everything falls apart. Lee, however, also managed to capture (through his artful direction) the beauty of decay and devastation in this human tragedy. The problem with the film is how Spike directs the audience in terms of drawing meaning of these events.The film has been described as a sort of litmus test; capturing in the opinions of viewers their unobstructed racial sympathies and allegiances. There is trickery in this interpretation however because the film had been made in such a matter that it is not fair in its depictions; the viewer is made to feel for certain characters more so than others. The grandest illustration of this can be seen during the final scenes of the film when Mookie goes to demand his weekly pay from Sal. The audience, like Sal, has an understanding that Mookie is a slothful, undeserving worker and that he betrayed Sal's affectionate feelings towards him. Race has nothing to do with how the audience should respond to this moment; all the viewer needs do is to reflect about the positive and negative aspects of the characters.The problem the film has however is that the African-Americans in the film are not presented in a fair light in their relationships with non-African-Americans characters. The white man with the bike that dirtied Buggin' Out's shoe, the Korean store-owners, Sal and his family are all treated disrespectfully in some form during the course of the film by African-American characters. There is a sense that within this neighborhood composed of predominantly African-Americans, that other races are not welcomed. The film does have sympathetic African-American characters, but during the riotous violence near the end the viewer can see that nearly everyone is involved. It is humanity at its worst, made up of entirely people of African-American descent and the audience understands that these people of color are responsibility for the crimes. Within the context of the film, the viewers are made to feel a lack of respect for an entire race of people.In a powerful scene just prior to the riot, Radio Raheem dies at the hands of two Anglo police officers. The police are depicted as employing excessive physical force of the victim; they undervalue the rights of the residents because of their simplistic understandings of the neighborhood and its people. Specifically, the police are attempting to suppress an oppositional criminal element that they have connected with the entire African-American community as a whole; to them, to be black is to be in the wrong. It is racism, pure and simple. However the character of Radio Raheem is less significant to the overall story of the film than Sal and therefore when his pizzeria is destroyed the audience cannot help but feel more affected. Spike Lee would argue that this is because the viewer values white-owned property more than black life. Lee, who wrote the film, needs to remember how a narrative directs the sympathies of the viewer. He made the viewer care for Sal; the viewer is not racism for following Spike's narrative.Spike Lee has publicly stated that white viewers are those most likely to seriously question whether his Mookie was justified in breaking the window of Sal's pizzeria and thereby inciting the riot that would ultimately destroy the Italian-American owned eatery. His reasoning was that the murder of Radio Raheem had made the riot defensible, or at least comprehensible, and the fierceness of their aggression served as a misdirected channel for their uncontrollable resentment against the injustice. The argument that human life is infinitely more precious than that of a brick and mortar structure is not simply understandable but it is an obvious reality that all sensible persons would freely admit. Lee's observation that African-American audiences would find this truism easier to grasp suggested the nature of the film, explicitly, that the film was tuned to frequency meant for an African-American audience. Such an interpretation on the part of Lee, while legitimate, is too limiting for a film that has much more to express than differences in the racial perspectives of the audience.",

I challenged myself to answer the following questions: Do any of the main characters in the film \"do the right thing\"? Why does Mookie act the way he does during the riot? What would have happened if he had not acted the way he did? How do the quotes at the end of the film relate to what happened? It's the kind of movie that really sticks with you and will have you thinking about it days after you've finished seeing it. It may start off slow, but the conclusion is well worth the wait.

            "content": "The reputation 'Do the Right Thing' gained upon its release as a racially incendiary picture has defined both the film itself and the reputation of its director and star, Spike Lee. Its rather pessimistic depiction of urban race relations had many people fearing it would incite the African-American community to riot. Their main qualm was that a piece of 'white property' was destroyed because of a riot that the film's main character incites. The same people, however, mostly forgot that a black man lost his life to police brutality first. Lee took, and still takes, offense against those mainstream critics who almost seemed to both suggest that black people could so easily be persuaded to destroy public property and that white property took precedence over black life. That critics also complained about the way the film portrayed a black, 'ghetto' community in a reasonably positive light only served to aggravate Lee further.And now in the era of increased accusations from conservatives towards liberals for 'race baiting' - educating or highlighting instances of institutional racism -, the tensions 'Do the Right Thing' created at the end of the 80's have become thematically relevant and rich to the contemporary viewer as they were during that earlier, quite neo-conservative decade. But despite Lee's reputation for creating pictures that flirt with Black militancy and supremacy (I personally find this not so common among his films as in his personality), DTRT's framing as 'a black picture' does a disservice to the universality of its perspectives, from the rough but benevolent white pizzeria owner Sal (Danny Aielo) to the lazy and rather selfish but lovable protagonist Mookie (Lee). The relationship between these two is fundamentally the key focus of the film, with the giant and seemingly threatening Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) the lighting rod that tests their already fragile friendship. By the end, we have seen both men's point-of-view and are hurt not only by the death and destruction that has snowballed from what was originally a minor complaint from the belligerent Buggin' Out (an unrecognisable Giancarlo Esposito), but also by how the conflict has divided them for reasons that to both men seem so unfair.Lee has been clear that he sides with his own protagonist by the film's end, and the film itself supports this by how Mookie ultimately loses little compared to Sal (though unlike the friend Mookie loses, the pizzeria Sal loses is recoverable). However, Lee rather optimistically has the two cautiously reconcile, and with that a hope for tranquility and even equality between the two, and by extension Blacks and Whites of the US, can be inferred.The film remains one of the best examinations of American racial politics. Its dialectical style, especially its subversion of political melodrama archetypes (the sympathetic minority victim, the brutal racist, etc.), demonstrate an intent not to manipulate audiences into feeling pity for black people but to get them to think about why these humans of both races, with all their flaws and prejudices, are the way they are.As the film ends with two juxtaposed quotations from MLK and Malcolm X on the ethics of violent residence to oppressive regimes, we are left to wonder, with all that we have seen and heard, how we can respect each other as human beings without compromising our autonomy. Such a query should be so simple, but the world keeps making it so complicated.",

It really seemed like one of the hottest and longest days of the summer. The actual depth of racism and how every race had something to say about the others is just sadly how things are. At times one feels like we've come a long way with acceptance, but there are still crimes happening due to this sort of thing. As long as more and more people come to appreciate one another less things such as what went on in this movie will happen.

            "content": "Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing\" is a picture of a moment in time. A moment in time in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, with all its casual beauty of teeming life, well, as teeming as life can be when the relentless sun makes the blood boil... This particular moment in eternity lasts a day and we follow the lives of the black community and an Italian pizzeria owner and his sons, who have established themselves in the 'hood. This is a flic made by black people about racial tensions, shot entirely on location and basically portrays the real thing with some dramatic artistic license. The cast of black actors works right down to the bit parts, providing the necessary authenticity for the milieu the movie tries to depict. Spike Lee himself is outstanding, but so is Ossie Davis, Samuel L. Jackson, John Turturro and others, but the Oscar nominated Danny Aiello gives the performance of his lifetime as the owner of the local pizza parlor caught in the center of the emerging trouble.Spike Lee shows two sides of the same coin with death and destruction written on it. Flip it as you will. The director doesn't judge the two sides. He happens to play a character in his film, and all of them have flaws, Lee's Mookie included. Only \"Da Mayor\", the old man, raises the voice of conscience and reminds everyone: Do the right thing! But is someone listening to the voice of reason when the hottest day of the year brings the harsh urban reality to the forefront? The mayhem that ensues follows the simple rule of consequence where one thing leads to another to inevitably snowball into a catastrophe. It leaves lives in shambles. The only thing that becomes apparent is that the fight isn't over, it's just not the fight against each other that can make any difference. There are no easy answers, but there's not much choice left, and it is dictated by a simple truth: We got to fight the power that be - and that's the triple truth, Ruth!",

            "content": "Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing\" is one of my most favorite films.  It is one of my favorites because it has an amazing lesson for us as a society and as a culture of diverse people.  One of the great musical artists, Marvin Gaye, wrote one of the most beautiful songs ever written!  His song \"What's Going On\", brought up the same message Spike Lee's film does.  Violence is not the answer!  We are all created equal!  And we should talk to people so we can find out more about ourselves.  We are wonderful creations of God, and we have so much to share with other people.  Love is the answer to these problems.  Every scene in the film portrays these everyday people as amazing, interesting, wonderful people who have something to say to us! And the sadness of the film is how the tragic ending shows us how much we as a society refuse to listen and let our anger get the better of us!  This is not only an anti-violence film, it is an anti-racism film.  We as a society often blow people off as a nigger, white trash, and so on.  \"Do the Right Thing\" lets us look deeper into these people's hearts and souls, and lets us realize not only how foolish we have been behaving, but how much wonder and beauty you can find in another human being.  \"Do the Right Thing\" is not even about racism or violence.  It's about humanity!  And it shows us how precious we are as humans by forcing the horror and stupidity of racism and violence on us.  This film shouldn't be recommended as entertainment or something good.  This should be required viewing!  It should be required because people have to know how stupid they have been behaving, and how easily they can change this world into a better place!",

            "content": "After having seen and really liking SHE'S GOTTA HAVE IT (1986), I can recall eagerly anticipating DO THE RIGHT THING and seeing it the week it opened. I can also recall leaving the theater and feeling blown away (a similar feeling after seeing such gems as PULP FICTION, BLUE VELVET, and SOMETHING WILD). From the wonderful opening shots of Rosie Perez dancing to Public Enemy's raucous \"Fight the Power,\" I was instantly hooked. In fact, like his friend Martin Scorsese, Spike Lee is one of the best filmakers around in terms of music selection (something I realized again seeing SUMMER OF SAM).Among the other highlights of DO THE RIGHT THING, which help to make it great:1. Deeply moving performances by Rubie Dee as Mother Sister and and Ossie Davis as Da Mayor. 2. comical moments which are quite hysterical - Robin Harris's comedic riffs and friendly put-downs are extremely funny; Spike Lee also brilliantly deflates racial/ethnic stereotyping by showing how ludicrous and absurd is sounds as its being spouted, and gets us to laugh at it in the process. Seeing the rude sports car owner get his car drenched with hydrant water was a funny, satisfying moment. 3. Great direction and camera work, giving this the feel of an epic - despite the fact that it was set on a single city block. 4. Absolutely fine acting by the principles - Danny Aiello, John Turturro, Richard Edson, and Giancarlo Esposito were all superb. 5. Elements of great realism and topicality; e.g., the argument between Rosie Perez's Tina and her mom looked and felt like a real fight, \"Sal's Famous\" looked and felt like a real place, the mutual facial expressions of hostility between cops and neighborhood residents, etc. 6. An ending which continues to provoke debate. 7. The story line unfolding over the course of a singular day. 8. Nearly all the characters, including the minor ones, are well fleshed out and thus quite memorable.Overall a great film. My rating = 10 (out of a possible 10)",

            "review_title": "Waltzing with Watts",
            "content": "This has all the ups and downs of a young filmmaker committing to a personal vision. He wants that vision to be a bit like jazz or hip-hop, so it has energy and raw, street-wise instrumentation, it has the despair of your world being too small for dreams and the kind of sweltering intimacy that you don't need a reason for and just springs at you. That's all fine.But, watching it now all the contrivance about it being real shows. The camera is jazzy but the world it riffs against feels curiously artificial and stagebound, like it's been adapted from a play instead from real streets. The people feel like tokens of eccentricity. The situations feel a lot of them set-up.The contrivance is that all of this is somehow impartial. A more obvious view is that Lee making the film is taking a side.The white man is the obnoxious guy in the fancy car that demands they turn off the fire hydrant. The white man is the cop who does. The white man runs business. Hell, even the Korean man runs business.That's probably life somewhere in New York, or was then. Lee probably thought he was being evenhanded. He was just making Watts into a film. So the frustrations are very probably real, but cinematically that is conveyed in a less than satisfying manner. Killer of Sheep of 10 years back worked its way around issues of cinematic formality by having at the helm a filmmaker who simply didn't know or didn't care a whole lot about other movies, so had no other aspiration than to capture life he knows. Truth felt unmediated. The problem here is an ambitious young guy who thinks he can translate that same life as Burnett's in terms of a few good movies he has seen, probably French (and Altman).Think I'm waxing? The Nouvelle Vague ideal was that life is a movie, no deeper than just a set of images that you contrive to happen.At the root of the film, is an angry young guy who wants images up on a wall that reflect him and reflect the world he knows and feels to be marginalized. It's an unreasonable demand, the way it's framed, that we simply can't wave off because we go on to spend time in this world where unreason is a systemic issue. This is much more provocatively framed in the finale as murder at the hands of a 'pig' cop and ensuing riots.It's an early Dogville, a film of similarly inspired theatric artifice, in that case Brecht and laid out in the open, except this is an angry young guy's film so, yes, the people are violent, injustice is a given, but we can point the accusatory finger to the inhuman representative of a faceless, evil 'system'.But it's simple-minded to rest there for film that wants to get at the bottom of things. Watts did not happen because of an arrest. It was the social heat that aggravated and this heat has systemic cause. Weather in this case does not arbitrarily fall from the sky.On the end that illustrates this, we have the 'pig' cop who enforces the system and Da Mayor's soliloquy about starving children. Slim pickings. Clumsy storytelling. Here's the problem; we have Radio Raheem's love/hate bit, a really cool scene in Lee's head, but really nothing about this person. Where does the money for blimps and a boombox come from? What does he do? What does Buggin Out do when he's not fussing over his Air Jordans or pictures on a wall? It's a reasonable accusation, anyway, but pop-superficial and reactionary in the way it's framed as much as political Godard of the 60's. There is merit in the sentiment but lost in angry phrasing.And this is what happens with partisan mentality in general and sloganeering. The effect of the film is that it got people talking, which is a good start, but has provided only enough thread to split opinion. Because the systemic cause is simple-minded in the film, so not convincingly illustrated that the thing is broken on the level where it's being administered from, viewers feel compelled to pick sides on the street; it was Sal's or Buggin Out's fault. See, the angry young guy's brash temperament splits a broader community of bystanders/viewers. We don't leave this with one vision.(It's a Marxist point that is muddled here and alienates; private business should operate on the same principles as a state, ergo the collective must be free to have a say on images that describe it.)Doing a bit of research, I stumbled across this nice tidbit that is perhaps its own insight: Buggin Out was cast in AMC's Breaking Bad as the perfectly respectable/socially-conscious owner of a food chain who gives to charity (does the right thing), but on the side uses business as a cover for a lucrative drug-dealing network. Apparently, he went into business in 1989 as an immigrant (an outsider) and his life before that is shrouded in mystery.Something to mull over in light of this film and social structures.",

            "content": "Spike Lee's `Do the Right Thing' is a vastly overrated film and a deeply unfortunate exercise of self-denial and a promotion of violence without reason.Consider this:  This film supposedly is about how a black community in Brooklyn is being oppressed by the `power'.   And their `oppression' is made unbearable by a summer heat wave.    Spike Lee totally ignores the fact that these characters can simply move somewhere else or heaven-forbid, actually work and do something meaningful with their lives.Mookie as played by Spike Lee is ingrate and a poor excuse for a father. His girlfriend is a foul-mouth character played by Rosie Perez.  As this charming couple uses one curse word after another in the presence of their child you really have to wonder why we should even begin to care about them. These characters are without any class or sense of responsibility.\nThe death of Radio Raheem (who spends his days walking around listening to his boombox and nothing else) sparks a riot against the only people (besides the Korean grocers) who actually work and provide a service to the community.  And on top of that, Raheem only dies because he resists arrest by the police officers trying to stop a riot.  This is no hero worth weeping over.And what sparks this riot?  Sal the Pizzeria owner (Danny Aiello) who runs and owns his own business has the audacity as a free citizen in a free country to display photos of his personal heroes who happened fellow Italian-Americans.   Late one night as he is closing up shop, he nicely lets in some customers (when he has every right not to) to serve them pizza. With gratitude, these customers start verbally and physically attacking Sal. Mookie (whose only source is income is Sal) throws a garbage can through Sal's window.Perhaps it's proper since this film is complete garbage.",

            "content": "Do the Right Thing is set on a single block in Bedford-Stuyvesant, a Brooklyn ghetto neighborhood, on a summer day so hot that the sun blisters your soul and the heat has a way of magnifying your irritability, of searing your heart \u2013 as we follow the on-goings of an multi-ethnic vicinity from a morning when interracial civility is already strained to a night when all hell breaks loose.Lee establishes the neighborhood dynamic right at the outset. The focal point of the activity is Sal's Famous Pizzeria, operated by the Italian-American Sal and his two sons \u2013 Pino, an unrepentant bigot, and Vito, a kindhearted kid, in tow. Our central protagonist Mookie has a pure dead-end job - making deliveries for Sal's pizzeria. Sal enjoys his business, respects his black patrons as long as they play by the rules and treats Mookie with the same combination of amused tolerance and restrained sarcasm that Mookie uses with him. However, Sal keeps a baseball bat handy if anyone wants to argue. No one has yet. Today someone will. Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) is fed up with the photos of celebrated Italians, from Sinatra to Stallone that decorate Sal's 'Wall of Fame'. He and his pals wants to see some black celebrities or 'brothers' as he puts it on that wall. Sal refuses to give into their demand and soon tempers flare as Buggin Out attempts to start a boycott of Sal's. When Radio Raheem (played by the superb Bill Nunn) enters Sal's with his boom box blaring Public Enemy's rap anthem \"Fight the Power\", tempers are way past the flare point. Sal's bat smashes the radio that is Raheem's pride. A fight ensues and the police are called - white police! Raheem, choked by a cop's stick, falls. Raheem's senseless killing releases all of Mookie's pent-up frustration and he sends a garbage can crashing through Sal's window during a galvanizing moment, as all howling hell breaks loose!Do the Right Thing is complex, bravura movie making, but is also hugely entertaining, since fortunately for us, Spike Lee's seditious method is to use humor to carry his biting message. The film's enormous amount of humor is satiric, physical, sometimes inside, sometimes throw-away, but pervasive. As temperature and tempers explode, Lee shoots his various characters through wide-angle lenses, their faces distorted to express how racism truly distorts the way you see others. While the characters are certainly etched in bold strokes, there are no heroes or villains here - there are fully fleshed characters with the complement of admirable and deplorable qualities. The exceptional work by all the actors helps keep the archetypes of ingrained bigotry from slipping into stereotypes.All of this leads up to an exceptionally honest climax to an exceptional film, a movie that wisely deprives you of the cozy resolutions and epiphanies so often manufactured by Hollywood. Spike Lee offers no reassurance, no uplift, no call for all races to join hands and spout liberal platitudes. What he does offer is a devastating portrait of urban American life \u2013 the most vigorous shake-up you have had in years!",

Visually and symbolically stunning, this film tackles some difficult social/political subjects that most directors of any race wouldn't touch. That's what makes Lee fearless. He just don't give a damn. This man went through such crap to get this movie made, it was unreal. Of course, the big guns didn't want to have anything to do with this \"controversial\" movie, but it's what the public needed. America has issues with being told what's wrong with it. Instead, they want lies fed to them daily or however often they watch movies instead of realizing the crap that they perpetuate. Movies support stereotypes, ideologies, and the majority. Lee's film shot all of those in the foot with his directing and acting. Apparently, people just want to be fed fantasy and not truth and reality beyond some filtered news medium. \"Movies are about escape\", such utter crap! What the hell are we doing in life that's so dreary that we need to be lied to in order to escape? We'd rather be lazy and not do anything about racism, sexism, the whole gamut. Instead, we say that's depressing. We aren't doing enough in real life to know what's going on there. What you think you know is also a bunch of lies, so I think it's time movies show truth. There aren't that many out there getting props, so let them live movie studios. It's not always about money! You won't shut down if one movie goes bad. It's scary to think that 10 companies own all the tv stations and movie companies in Hollywood...10. We need people who think outside the box. This film supports that. You can feel the heat and tension throughout the neighborhood. The racial slur montage was amazing. It brought to light the hatred, misunderstandings, and hurts of the day.

I just could not understand why Mookie would ever think it was OK to ask for his pay after he smashed out the pizzeria restaurant.Many of the issues involving race, such as Mookie and Pino over Pino's racist tendencies, are well thought out arguments.

So at times it is not as clear as you would want it to what Spike Lee is trying to address here. Also, I'm not sold on the opening, and although people may say it's art, it just feels unnecessary to me.Overall, Do the Right Thing is a very powerful movie and, although it may get lost in the way, the message it conveys is important and one should look very closely when watching the movie, or you may miss it.",

Some choose to disregard it, but after years of segregation, discrimination, and outright racism along with the laws passed to address them, separate communities still rein supreme in more urban and diverse locations. This film features all the stereotypes you've been familiarized with long ago, and it's certainly not ashamed to paint the picture and dwell on heated rivalries stirred about between two distinguished cultures. Now, this is where the audience is likely to encounter confusion as to what side the film favors and its definitive message. Frankly, I couldn't spot its message as the protagonist, contrary to the very title of the movie, finds himself commencing chaos and destroying a well- established pizzeria towards the very end when you'd expect him to be the peacemaker in that intensifying situation. And as the omniscient theme of the feature emerges once again (\"fight the powers that be!\"), you wonder if this movie could somehow be acting as a catharsis against the supremacists and potent races. Spike Lee's film doesn't promote a friendly mindset in overly sentimental fashion where the main character realizes that kindness and tolerance is a truer value as he proceeds to unite the multiple communities and assist them in coexisting with one another. No, instead, this story remains brutally honest throughout, and it simply exclaims, \"Enough of this malarkey! We're not going to deal with it because it is what it is!\" It doesn't favor any side of the spectrum whatsoever, depicting horribly racist African-Americans, Italians, and Latinos all around. Upon entering this experience, a moviegoer might expect it to sympathize with the African-American community or perhaps with the Caucasians. Don't be mistaken as it never does even when it might appear so. As a result of such a genuine premise though, there are actually some good laughs to be had through its use of dark (black would be too much of a pun) humor. Of course, most viewers might be hesitant, as was apparent, to laughter because of its utter political incorrectness. Some bits of the dialogue and basic gestures brought upon some decent comedy while uncompromising its otherwise serious and weighty subject matter. I have to also lend applause to the mostly compelling script and plot since it had my eyes mostly hooked to the screen the entire time, and I rarely felt like the pacing relaxed for a few minutes. An abundance of conflict maintained the film's entertaining nature. Moving on from the story alone, I found the color scheme rather clever as we lay witness to quite vibrant colors on walls, streets, and whatnot. It might be as focused due to its presentation of the diversity and colorfulness (as in numerous different races and nationalities), for lack of a better term, of the population in New York specifically. It also complements the flamboyance of many characters. The cinematography might be simple at first glance, but it often takes upon the feel of an MTV music video or rawness in that of the impoverished and troubled neighborhood. With all that being said, I definitely enjoyed Do the Right Thing; it's an exceptional film that once again reminds us just how relevant and dominant racism and prejudice remain in this country especially.",

I'm still not sure if I like Lee's style, but it's definitely one that has its merits.Do the Right Thing is the story of one summer's day day in a New York ghetto on which numerous racial minorities converge in explosive ways. At its best, the movie manages to invoke a sense of community and capture a broad amount of people in a short amount of time. It also perfectly captures that lazy summer-day feeling, or at least it does for the mostly plot less first three-quarters, making it oddly work as a chilling-out movie.

Unlike Driving Miss Daisy, released the same year, it views race relations as a problem without much of a solution. Lee's interest is on \"telling it how it is\" and like most of his filmography he tries to put a message across but ends up only partially succeeding.Set over the course of one day, Do the Right Thing tells an intertwined story of a predominantly black neighborhood in Brooklyn. Set in just one block it most prominently features Italian-American pizzeria owner Sal (an Oscar-nominated Danny Ailleo), his two racist sons, Mookie (Lee himself), and a host of other characters like Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) and Da Mayor (Ossie Davis). Although the clash may seem to simply be the African Americans vs. the Italian Americans, Lee tries to show deeper schisms within each community. Each character serves as a microcosm of sorts. Da Mayor represents the elder African American, intent on establishing trust and friendship between everyone. Sal tries hard to not be a racist and genuinely cares for the customers he serves. But Buggin' Out and Sal's son Pino (John Turturro) are the most vicious characters in the film. They constantly spew racism to anyone and everyone who will listen and are convinced that they are authority matters on their subjects. They do not wish to create harmony but would rather get their own way. Although the older generations embodied in Sal and Da Mayor seem more level headed, the younger generations are seen as less forgiving and more prone to violence.Lee's point by showing these troubled relations is not so much to propose a solution to the problem but show the problem. Most characters in the film are unlikable by the conclusion. They, for the most part, fail to \"do the right thing\" and instead let anger take over. Sal shows his racist insides by using the n-word and then smashes Radio Raheem's boom box. Mookie, mostly ambivalent throughout the film, initiates the film's concluding riot. Everyone, according to Lee, has the propensity for violence and racism. This is a stark contrast to other films dealing with similar issues. In the Heat of the Night, Driving Miss Daisy, and the later film Crash all show that mutual peace and respect can be achieved despite racial differences. Lee does not really seem to believe that message, offering a glimmer of optimism in the film's last scene but ultimately focusing on the destruction in the community.This decision to not propose a solution and to remain pessimistic is both Do the Right Thing's strength and weakness. Although the writing, acting, editing, cinematography are all frenzied and energetic enough to demonstrate Lee's message the film still feels fractured and sometimes dramatically stunted. Although Mookie seems to be the main character or anchor for the film there does not seem to be a clear focus. There is an omnipresent narrative perspective, sometimes one that breaks the fourth wall, but one that never suggests a more developed understanding of film. Lee's earlier She's Gotta Have It used some narrative experimentation to explore the inner subjectivity of its protagonist and also was mostly seen from her perspective. With a sprawl of characters Lee is unable to really find a cohesive enough way to tell the story. Although the splintered narrative may seem appropriate for the film's storyline, it ends up distracting. Individual relationship stories are shown that do not seem to really advance the film. Character development sometimes feels labored. The film only runs for 2 hours but it seems that Lee wants to develop his characters as much as humanly possible-although some seem much more complex than others. The message given at the end of the film seems to be that everyone is in this mess together, embodied by the setting of one block. He does not really suggest what people must do to overcome the racist urges in them but suggest that they all have them. He is unable to dramatically remedy this and the film feels more like a dramatic exposition.All said and done Do the Right Thing is still a partially successful film. It entertains and elicits a powerful emotional response from the viewer. After seeing the film it is difficult not to feel something about what was just experienced. Some people take Sal's side, others Buggin' Out's. The \"side\" taken is not really important, it just reflects how each individual reacts differently to the same presentation. The editing, cinematography, and performances are given 100% by the respective filmmakers. Every character feels real and full blooded, not a clich\u00e9 found in Paul Haggis' Crash. They are often frustrating but never untrue. This is remembered as Lee's best film... personally, I would argue that She's Gotta Have It is. But nonetheless it should be respected and praised for it's representation of a complex and fractured society at this time and place.",

That happens as he writes and directs a mind-blowing drama called, \"Do The Right Thing.\" This is the best film of 1989. Itis also one of the important movies of our time that shows the raw emotion of racism. The story takes in New York City on a hot day in the summer, which is perfect for the film's intensity level. Racism is flowing through the neighborhood as everybody is telling their own opinion on race, sometimes offensive. Lee also keep us focused as we these people in the neighbor hood talking about the problem as is spread. As the day comes to a end, the racism soon explodes into violence. This movie is very good as for a movie about racism. Spike Lee keeps us on the edge of our feet as the growing rage turns into hard-hitting violence. What we have to learn is that we're the same people, but with different color skin. It's a wake-up to the society. Why use violence and hate? That's what Do The Right Thing does best.

            "content": "Do the Right Thing, directed by the somewhat controversial Spike Lee, is a somewhat controversial movie dealing with hard topics like racism, prejudice and violence. Interestingly enough, it's also the movie that Barack Obama and Michelle Obama saw on their first date. The movie is set during an extremely hot day in Brooklyn, New York. It revolves around a group of characters leaving there. Some of the most prominent characters in the movie are Mookie (Spike Lee) who works at Sal's pizzeria, Sal himself (Danny Aiello), Sal's sons Vito (Richard Edson) and Pino (John Turturro), and an old drunk bump called Da Mayor (Ossie Davis). It's hard to find the main narrative focus since the majority of the movie consists of characters just interacting. But the central topic of Do the Right Thing is prejudice and violence.It's hard to stay neutral when you try to discuss what is the role of violence when trying to achieve racial equality. However, Spike Lee manages to stay neutral \u2013 during the whole movie he never says whether he considers violence to be justified or not. He just presents his characters like they really are, he presents them as real people. No matter if his characters are black or white, he presents them all as grey. This lack of definitive answer might annoy some people, but I had no problem with it. I liked how Spike Lee left the interpretation to the audience.Apart from being a movie that could easily find its place in some philosophical/sociological/psychological debate, Do the Right Thing is also masterful on the technical level. Spike Lee amazingly uses awkward close-ups and camera angles to further portray the tension between the characters. Furthermore, the song 'Fight the Power' by Public Enemy is effectively used throughout the whole movie as a fitting soundtrack to the Brooklyn setting. The actors also do a pretty good job. John Turturro is great as the racist Italian Pino, Spike Lee is plausible and believable as the easy-going Mookie and Ossie Davis does a memorable portrayal of the drunk Mayor. Samuel L. Jackson's role as the local radio DJ is almost a cameo but greatly done. Do the Right Thing is truly good on every level, and its thematics are strong, shocking and important even today. I strongly suggest watching this Spike Lee joint.Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",

I had, but at 15 I didn't realize that the revolution went beyond the (at the time) radically different cinematography that helped tell the story, along with the explosive dialogue.  Do the Right Thing was the beginning of a wave of important African American cinema that defined its culture beyond blaxploitation.  Watching it again 15 years later, its personal importance as a film that inspired me to want to study or possibly make films has not diminished, but perhaps the fire that it lights under the subject of race relations is just a bit less hot.  Perhaps it is because, like with violence, we as the viewers have become desensitized in a politically correct era and therefore consider this film to be preachy because it doesn't give us the answers in a candy-coated manner.  Regardless, Do the Right Thing remains a relevant film that is important to film history. \n--Shelly",

Maybe Spike Lee intended to shoot it from the perspective of a white american, I'm not sure, but the plot takes us though the micro climate of the projects and the struggles of american racism on one of the hottest days of the year.Right out the bat, we get a powerful intro with \"Fight the Power\" by Public Enemy and a lot of hip hop influenced dance moves. It's a really good song but it kind of got worn out through out the movie since it's played multiple times. We also get introduced to a wast majority of the characters that we'll get to follow through out the movie. At first it's kind of hard to follow all the plotlines but it gets better once you get familiar with all of them. Some you'll love immediately, some you'll grow to love, some you'll hate but at the end there wasn't really anyone I was cheering for.What probably irritated me the most was probably that the whole chaos by the end was caused mostly because one nincompoop got angry because no people of color were hanging on the hall of fame at the local restaurant in the neighborhood. When it eventually leads to inevitable violence, all hell breaks lose and police brutality claims another victim and, consumed by rage, Sal's pizzeria is destroyed.Overall, I really loved the acting of the whole cast. The plot was above average with some minor flaws and what hurt this movie misdirected anger through out the movie. Nobody did the right thing here and I'm not sure what Spike Lee intended to say with this film.",

Radio Raheem (Nunn) is walking around Bed Stuy blasting Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\". Until, Buggin' Out (so brilliantly played by Giancarlo Esposito) goes into Sal's (Aiello) Pizzeria for a slice of pizza and notices no African Americans on his Wall of Fame.

From the choice of music (Public Enemy and the score by his father Bill Lee and Branford Marsalis) to the setting (Brooklyn USA, cant get any better than that). The realism of the film is incredible, you could be watching this in the middle of Winter and still be sweating looking at the hot weather surrounding the characters. \"Do The Right Thing\" has some of the most memorable scenes in movie history (i.e. the scene where Buggin' Out's Air Jordan gets stepped on by a white man). \"Do The Right Thing\" is a masterpiece that went unnoticed by the Academy Awards or the AFI for the Top 100.

I honestly think the entire thing is an overly glorified, class i s t piece of excrement that attempts to make a racial issue out of the fact that humanity is just disgusting.

That would be too simple, and this is not a simplistic film. It covers a day in the life of a Brooklyn street, so that we get to know the neighbors, and see by what small steps the tragedy is approached.There are really no heroes or villains in the film. There is even a responsible cop, who screams \"that's enough!\" as another cop chokes Radio with his nightstick. And perhaps the other cop is terrified because he is surrounded by a mob and the pizzeria is on fire. On and on, around and around, black and white, fear and suspicion breed and grow. Because we know all of the people and have spent all day on the street, we feel as much grief as anger. The thing is, there are no answers. There may be heroes and villains, but on this ordinary street in Brooklyn they don't conveniently turn up wearing labels. Racism is so deeply ingrained in our society that the disease itself creates mischief, while most blacks and whites alike are only onlookers.None of these people is perfect.

All people, being predisposed towards judgment and classification, struggle to imagine a world that is colorless either in equality or inequality, but in equality making sure to preserve color. Whitewash everything so you get every color put together but none stands out, or whitewash everything so that no color remains at all.Spike Lee focuses most of his energies as a filmmaker into problems of racial tension, and in this, one of his truly breakout films, he analyzes the duality of violence and civic disobedience (and other dualities such as love/hate) and tries to show how they can or cannot be used. In the best of \"objective\" ways, the actually solution is open-ended and unclear: we are left with only the picture of Martin Luther King Jr shaking hands and grinning with Malcolm X, in the famous photo which is the only known one of the two activists together.So what do we have to explore this theme with? Well, we have a radio DJ connecting everyone through media self-consciously, as most movies dealing with racial dilemmas tend to include; we have various stereotypes ranging from the old drunk to the ho to the AYE-tahl-lee-ins; and we have a main character named Mookie, played by Spike Lee himself, who is the only self-actualized person in the film and, as a result, is a pompous jerk.Thus, while the heat rises (signifying increasing tension), we have all the fun and revelatory speculation of watching a bunch of stereotypes yell at each other, only occasionally taking a moment to let Mookie give in a word otherwise while he basically abuses them passive aggressively and always gets what he wants, which what he wants is unclear, all until it culminates in the most materialistic of the characters getting together and doing something really, really stupid.Of course it's all very revealing of the state of social tension and the difficulties imposed by multivarious ethnic identities all conglomerated into a whole and attempting to find identity while cutting in to each other to \"fight the power\" on their way to self-destruction, and if you don't get that the first ten times the movie says it, it's all summed up in quotes at the end. Or it's just banal. I'm pretty sure most people think of this movie in terms of the former, so I'll just leave it at that. Have a nice day.--PolarisDiB",

Sal, Vito, Da Mayer, and Jade are the good people in this one.Buggin Out was probably the worst out of all of them and the most racist with Pino coming in 2nd. It's blatantly obvious Buggin Out doesn't like White people, he had an attitude towards Sal before even griping about Sal's Wall of Fame (and throwing trash on his floor.) He questioned Mookie why he was hanging out with Vito, and then gets in the face of the guy who accidentally bumped into him and questioning why a white man wanted to live in a black neighborhood.With Buggin Out going all over town trying to get people to join his boycott of Sal's (because he got kicked out for causing problems, ) only Radio Raheem joins him because he's mad Sal yelled at him (over his stereo blasting in his restaurant to turn it off.) These 2 storm into Sal's restaurant at the end with attitudes blasting music again and spitting on his floor, and screaming, demanding pictures of black people be put on his wall of fame (because blacks frequent the place the most.) Sal was sick of it. He had warned both of them earlier in the movie, (AT THE EXACT SAME LEVEL THEY WERE ADDRESSING AND ACTING TOWARDS HIM,) and he finally snaps dropping the N-word and destroying the stereo. You know good and well he didn't mean it and had been good to so many others throughout the movie. This leads to them and others in the restaurant fighting which leads to the cops coming to break it up and the two that started every bit of it refused to calm down and the cops inadvertently kill Radio Raheem not realizing he was being choked to death. Now everyone in town in claiming murder, they're not safe, etc. And then the destruction starts, destroying and setting fire to the restaurant. They even want to move to the convenience store across the street that's run by Asians who have done nothing but luckily one person convinces the mob not to.This is the type of behavior that was wrong then and it's wrong now. Sal and Mookie are pretty much the majority of all of us, we make do with the few who are what's wrong with this country and when one bad apple like Buggin Out or Pino go too far and keep on, we snap.

            "content": "Do The Right Thing is a 1989 film written and directed by Spike Lee. Let me just cut into it, the film depicts race relations like no other film, it isn't over the top racism, or the white savior complex, it's real. This film is a low budget independent film, as Spike Lee made the most out of it. The film is directed in a very unqiue way, with odd angles, close zoom in, an quick jumps of dialogue. The set is stylish and so are the costumes. The performances while some are one dimensional, still hold up, like the performances by Ossie Davis, Danny Aileo, and Spike Lee himself. This film is written with powerful dialogue and a great soundtrack as well. Essentially, this film is about the constant battle of love vs. hate. This film is about the clashing perspectives of that battle, and how it is impossible to \"Do The Right Thing\" in a system that's broken. This film has no resolution of an ending. Just angry, bitter, and ignorant people. Except for da mayor. This film is about how bigotry and hate is alive very much, and how little things can set it off, turning into bigger things that shouldnt happend. This film is about the reactions of the oppressed and the poweful in a flawed system. This film is about whether or not violence is the answer. All peace is an impossible virtue, yet violence and hate is a never ending wheel of recycled unresoltion. This film couldn't be more relevant to the current climate of the world today. Do The Right Thing is a cinematic landmark.",

And unfortunately, everything I liked about \"Clockers\" was absent in this movie.Of course I had a bad feeling about this movie as it started off with 4 1/2 minutes of a slutty looking woman having a seizure accompanied by bad music. Then 4 minutes of an inane morning dj spouting a string of unconnected meaningless words.Direction:  He had his moments, but it was pretty much a 2-hour music video. Cinematography: After 10 minutes my eyes hurt from orange.  After a half hour my head hurt from orange.  The next day I'm still not seeing colors correctly after 2 hours of nothing but orange.  Characters:  What characters?  There were a lot of bodies, but no real people.  Everybody was very one-dimensional.  Acting:  Might have been OK had there been anything for the actors to work with.  Story:  Could have been taken care of in 20 minutes.  Music:  Very disappointing after the excellent original music in \"Clockers\".  The music was as shallow as everything else.On the other hand, the riot scene was pretty good and would have made a good short.",

            "content": "It's easy to see how it was assumed that the film would incite certain audiences to riot when it first came out in 1989. Spike Lee's feature is certainly a balls-to-the-wall, no holds barred sort of affair that sheds a lot of light on the community complexities in the urban environment, particularly in a cultural stew as diverse as Brooklyn.Most interesting is how Lee uses a variety of cinema techniques to enhance the viewing experience in terms of exploring this neighborhood through the point of view of the characters and audience. The use of a hand held camera style is implemented periodically to break the fourth wall and demonstrate the variety of differences and prejudices that simmer behind the cultural and ethnic interactions of the neighborhood residents. It is through these devices that the film is able to weave an analysis of the relationship, that frequently conflicts, between love and hate.It is here where the motivations of the characters come into play, and the true artistry of 'Do the Right Thing' shines. All of the characters are well rounded human beings, each with their respective strengths, and failings as individuals, representatives of their ethnic backgrounds. Their personal prejudices and pride (of which they all share a part of) resulting from their working class struggles often lead them into amusingly horrific conflict between the characters, and much of the tension is derived from these moments. Above all this, some characters are able to offer introspective analysis into the reasons for their destitution, whether it is because of their social standing or simply a lack of personal endeavor. It is up for the viewer to draw their own conclusions from the humanity that resides there, and the mistakes that are made.But it is not just the multitude of colourful characters that bring this film to life, but the production design and cinematography as well. Colours are imbued with reds, oranges, yellows, and loud hues to portray the intense heat of this particular Brooklyn day. The racial tensions that hover over them only add to the weight on everyone's shoulders, and before we know it the film is spiraling into its riveting climax.This is a film that will certainly leave you thinking, and while the unnecessary exposition at the end may leave one feeling as though Spike Lee may have undone much of the complexities explored upon earlier, \"Do the Right Thing\" is still a marvelously affecting experience that is truly a portrait of the cultural experience in an ever more closely connected world.",

Mookie did not throw the can because of pictures; during the film, he couldn't care LESS about the pictures.  Mookie tosses the trash can because he just watched one of his friends get murdered in cold blood by New York's finest.Suppose you're at a 7-11, and one of YOUR best friends is involved in an altercation with the manager.  You're there watching, yelling at them to break it up.  The cops arrive.  They drag your friend to his feet, then proceed to strangle him to death, right there in front of you.  They dump your best friend's body in a squad car and take off down the street.  You're standing there in front of this 7-11 with the manager.  There's a brick by the front window of the store.  What would you do?  Would it be the right thing?  Tell me with a straight face that you would so something different. Make me believe you.On the Criterion DVD of this film, Spike Lee states that he has been asked many times whether or not Mookie did the right thing.  He also states that NOT ONE PERSON OF COLOR has EVER asked that question, because from where they stand, there IS no question.  A pizzeria is not worth a human life.",

Now that I have seen it, the movie has been haunting me.I think there is a huge misunderstanding about the film. Many assume this is pro-Black politics/world view; however, the movie seems to be squarely against Black ideology. This is a much more complex film than the silly movie Crash, and people should look at what this movie is actually showing. It does not clearly indict any ideology, and there is a strong question mark at the end.First, many of the Black characters are silly and misguided. Sure, the \"son\" of the Italian restaurant owner is racist, but the father and other son clearly appreciate being a part of the community. In fact, prior to the riot, the owner is very pleased with his situation. The riot starters have a ridiculous request--to put Black pictures up in an Italian restaurant. It is clear that we are supposed to think they are not serious, and they do not really understand Black history. Even the older Black residents see them as silly.The riot actually destroys one of the few places in the neighborhood that is welcoming. It creates distance. We do not fully understand why Spike Lee's character throws the trash can because he is even seen as a son. He seems to \"bite the hand that feeds him.\" Nothing is resolved by the misdirected anger other than someone is dead. There is a picture placed on the wall, but the place is dead by that point. The fact that violence happens over a picture on a wall shows how superficial some race politics tend to be.I know many think that Spike Lee is a \"race\" baiter--that he supports Black politics, but even Malcolm X tends to suggest that extreme Black politics can be misdirected. I suppose people can see what they want to see in the film, but the movie is much more complex than simple Black/White issues. This is a film that raises more questions than solves problems.",

In \"Do the Right Thing\", he does exactly that in a story set in a racially charged Brooklyn neighborhood.Lee plays a slacker pizza delivery kid named Mookie who works for Danny Aiello's \"Sal's Place\". The movie follows his life over the course of one exceptionally hot day, when the heat seems to fuel all of the simmering racial tensions past the boiling point.There are a lot of great moments in the movie, with bits of humor, anger, and sadness mixing to create a intimate portrayal of life in \"Da Hood\" (or so I would assume). We develop an intimate understanding of all the different factions that contribute to racial outbursts, and come to respect them in turn. Most of the characters are highly sympathetic, and thus Lee's trademark ambiguity comes into play. The done-to-death phrase \"Can't we all just get along?\" comes to mind.At the heart of this movie is the question of what is the best way to change the system. \"Do the Right Thing\" presents us with two options--the Martin Luther King method of dialogue and concilation vs. the Malcolm X endorsed method of civil disobedience/violence. The movie raises the questions without necessarily offering the answers, and that was perhaps what I enjoyed the most.I'm rating the joint a 7.5, because I personally don't like my movies too \"rough\", and this one definitely has many of those fuzzy edges. As a morality play though, and as a look into inner-city life with its colorful character, this one is definitely worth a look.",

I've always wanted to see a film that perfectly shows how people's deep feelings and cruel intentions can be expressed through great amounts of pressure. And this is the concept of the very complex, yet very beautiful film: Do the Right Thing. It shows real people under pressure, and how they interact with one another, as the evils of their souls fidgets out of them, like fire ants running out of an ant hill as it is slowly destroyed by a little boy. \"Do the Right Thing\" is a day in the life of the residents of a city block in Brooklyn, on the hottest day of the year. They consist of a kaleidoscope of different characters and different nationalities. And as the day progresses, and the temperature rises, the racial tension grows between them, and by the end of the day, the inevitable culture clash happens. The \"hero\" of the film is Mookie (played by director Spike Lee), a delivery boy who works at the local pizzeria run by Sal (Danny Aiello in an Oscar nominated performance) and his two sons. The great thing about this film is that all the characters are flawed, which can only add to the immense realism of the film. \"Do the Right Thing\" has many admirable qualities as well. The cast is top notch. Spike Lee and Danny Aiello really carry the film, and they get great support from the two old pros Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, as well as many now-famous celebrities that owe a lot of their success to this film. The film helps to introduce such now well known stars as Samuel L. Jackson, Martin Lawrence, and John Turturro. It contains many odd camera angles and scenes where characters talk directly to the camera, all of which are elements that Spike Lee is now famous for. The film's odd mix of a jazzy score, to a soundtrack by 'Public Enemy', is striking. The sad thing about this film is that it is often misunderstood, and sometimes considered anti-white. This is not the case. Nearly every nationality is depicted, and all have their flaws. Another element of the film that is also misunderstood and controversial, is the riot scene near the end of the picture. It is hard to explain it without spoiling it, but I will say that in the end, Mookie did the right thing.\"Do the Right Thing\" is a groundbreaking cinematic experience that should not be missed. Unfortunately, this is easily the most under-appreciated films of all time, and easily the best film of the 80's. For such a bad decade of films, this one closed it with a bang.-30-",

They start to garner attention from the black folks in the community because they want to see some African Americans up on the wall. This movies central message was that violence isn't the answer. I think the director illustrates his message by relating it back to the speech's made by Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X that there is a peaceful solution to racism. Although this movie is funny at times I think it was overshadowed by the serious message about racism that it was trying to convey.

Spike Lee shows us in a brilliant way how blind hatred can destroy everyone's life.  The tragic fate of Radio-Rahim and the fear in the eyes of the Korean grocer when he tries to explain to the angry crowd that he's not white are two of the strongest moments in any film I have seen. Two of the most memorable performances come from two veteran actors Danny Aielo (the italian-american pizzeria owner and Spike Lee's employer) and Ossie Davis (as da Mayor, a drunkard who tries to keep things in order in a neighboorhood where hatred is growing everyday). Spike Lee has matured a lot as his latest films have shown us, but \"Do the right thing\" is probably the most powerful work of this very emotional film-maker who manages to put a lot of his emotions and his energy in his films.",

            "content": "The ensemble cast of Do the Right Thing, which includes Spike Lee playing the main character, Mookie, is one of the best you'll see in any movie, and yet the star of the show is Lee as writer and director. The strength of the script is not in the plot, which is fairly straightforward: it is the hottest day of the Summer in the predominantly African-American neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, and Mookie's friends Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) and a boom-box-toting philosopher named Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) stage a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria, which is run by an Italian-American family (Danny Aiello, John Turturro, and Richard Edson) for which Mookie delivers pizzas. Racial tensions rise with the temperature, culminating in a tragic and destructive street riot. This story spine serves as the backbone from which hangs the real meat of the film: mood, characterization, and social commentary. Mookie's job as delivery man allows Lee to follow himself through the neighborhood, and allows us to help ourselves to a daily slice of the lives of its inhabitants. That slice of life has several delicious toppings: humor, romance, and an undeniable street vibe, aided in large part by raps from Public Enemy and a misdirecting jazz score featuring Branford Marsalis on tenor sax playing original music by Bill Lee. Especially entertaining is the love-hate-love relationship between Da Mayor, beautifully played by Ossie Davis, and Mother Sister, just as beautifully played by Ruby Dee. The \"chorus\" of this modern-day Greek tragedy\u2014a trio of beer guzzling men perched across the street from a successful Korean-owned shop\u2014is the source of poignant observations, as well as huge belly laughs. Also like a Greek tragedy, fear and sadness invade the proceedings, as we witness the inevitable acts of destruction unfold. Except, in this case, the destruction results from a tragic flaw collectively held by the neighborhood, rather than a single protagonist. There is also catharsis, starting with a montage in the middle of the film, in which several of the characters spew racial slurs directly at the camera, as if Lenny Bruce was right when he suggested that maybe we could say these words enough that they would eventually lose their meaning. Of course, the effect is ephemeral, and the true catharsis is yet to come, following a sequence of actions in which each actor does the wrong thing, from the 20/20 perspective of an outsider's view of the outcome, but the right thing from the narrow perspective of an individual's situation and personal experience of the world. The argument that spurs Buggin Out's futile boycott\u2014which culminates in an after-hours confrontation with Radio Raheem by his side, blasting his music in Sal's face\u2014has merit. Since all of Sal's customers are African American, and they spend \"much money\" at his pizzeria, in a sense they are part owners and should have some say in the decor. At the same time, Sal's earlier refusal to comply with Buggin Out's insistence that Sal post pictures of famous African Americans alongside the Italian Americans on his Wall of Fame seems justified. Sal is the boss; it's his establishment, and he reserves the right to decorate his place to his liking. In a sense, they are both right. Sal's attack on Radio Raheem's radio can be justified with a similar rationale: Sal is the owner, and Radio and Buggin Out are misbehaving. On the surface, Radio's reaction to Sal's destruction of his radio seems difficult to justify, but we know that Radio's boom box is much more than an inanimate object; an attack on his music is like an attack on his soul. Mookie's precipitation of the riotous devastation of Sal's pizzeria is righteous retaliation for his friend's wrongful death, especially since retaliation against the cops is not viable. The only indictment Lee seems to make is against the cops\u2014but they, too, are given the benefit of the doubt; Radio's death from excessive force seems accidental, at the hands of a police force that has lost control of the neighborhood. In the companion volume to the film (a book that includes the script, as well as Lee's production journal), there is a still of Radio Raheem's lifeless body, with a caption beneath the photograph that reads, \"Murdered by hate.\" In the world of the movie, this hatred emanates in both directions\u2014in all directions. It's as if the gods have randomly pulled disenfranchised people from all four corners of the globe, crammed them into a single inner-city block, and left them there with neither the social tools nor the understanding to deal with their differences. This is the melting pot melting down, where it is as difficult to choose between integration and segregation as it is to determine the right thing to do.",

            "content": "I've heard many critics complain that 'Do the Right Thing' is a completely biased film that demonizes white people and incites racial bigotry. After viewing it for the first time, I'm led to believe that such people have seen a completely different film. Much rather than pursuing some sort of ethnic agenda, 'Do the Right Thing' depicts the biases and prejudices that people of all races bear. The film takes place in a predominantly African-American neighborhood in Brooklyn, in the middle of an intense heatwave. The neighborhood is also home to groups of Puerto Ricans, Koreans and Italian-Americans. Throughout the day, racial tensions become more and more erratic until they eventually erupt into a violent, much-discussed climax. At first glance, it is easy to come to the conclusion that the owners of Sal's Pizzeria, particularly Pino (John Turturro), are the racist villains of the film. But then again, so is Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) with his personal attacks on the neighborhood's white residents. So is Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn), with his conflict with the Korean shop-owners. So are the police officers with their barbaric displays of brutality. The point of the film is that there are no definitive heroes or villains. Everyone is just as good, and just as bad as each other. Everyone, despite initially appearing otherwise, has their own racial biases and frustrations. The film's climax has sparked much controversy due to the motives and actions of the characters involved. Much like the personalities and perspectives of many of the film's characters, there is a deliberate layer of ambiguity and confusion in terms of the conflict. Not one single person can be held responsible for the fire that destroys Sal's Pizzeria, or more importantly the death of Radio Raheem. Rather, the collective actions, misunderstandings and prejudices of the suburb's inhabitants culminate in this final tragedy, one that could have been avoided if everyone had just 'done the right thing'. The acting, cinematography, screenplay (all mostly thanks to Spike Lee) are all superb. More importantly,however, is the message that Lee conveys through the final product, one that objectively points out the universality and ludicrousness of racial and ethnic hatred and discrimination. Must-see viewing.",

            "content": "Warning don't read unless seen film.This is one of my favorite films of all time as well as drama films, also summertime films if you can believe that as the film takes place in summer. It's kind of rare for me to have films in the drama category being one of my favorites, mainly it sort of depends on the subject matter and how much the story truly grabs and resonates with me, and this thankfully is one of those films. I remember seeing this film when I was a junior in high school as I was expanding my horizons on film watching.The film really resonated with me because I myself have been victimized by prejudice, with bullying in schools I've gone to even within my own neighborhood; and this film I felt perfectly conveyed the ugly nature of Racism and Prejudice.The film you can say is almost like a Robert Altman film (not a fan of the director) as his films have been known for conveying parts of the human condition. This film shows a piece of it which is a neighborhood somewhere in \"New York\", taking place in the summer time and in a matter of days; despite only a short span of time and in only a section of a big city a lot can happen and you truly can learn a lot. Really like the setting which is this inner city neighborhood, I never have lived in these kinds of neighborhoods but despite a different setting the sense of familiarity is there from how close each of the homes are, shops and other businesses and even how people know everyone else. Which makes this film all the more hard hitting because what happens in the film could possibly happen in your own neighborhood.Really like the music score, the film has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. One song that is my favorite of all is in the end credits by one of my favorite singers the late great Al Jarreau called \"Never Explain Love\". It's just a beautiful song, it could of easily of been in a romance film, but it fits hear perfectly as it really tells about the beautiful nature of love and its importance.The film also has a good mixture of feeling where at first you can say part of the first half of the film is almost a dramady. As there are some funny scenes like with three old guys that are sitting in front of a red brick wall just enjoying the day, one of them talks about the polar ice caps melting and wanting to buy a boat once the city floods. I just thought that was funny and relatable because even though that conversation is almost random and actually not far off considering what's currently happening to our environment; we all have conversations like that, like with my friends we just like talking about all different kinds of things were interested in that's just what happens. But of course, as the film gets further you then start to feel uneasy, even though everything might be sunny it doesn't hide the darkness of hate that is rising.There are some interesting scenes like one scene which shows this montage of characters in the film facing the camera and their all making derogatory racist insults and comments, until Radio D. J. Love Daddy (Samuel L Jackson) puts an end to it which I'll admit was just sweet relief for me and everyone that saw this scene. This scene really shows a couple of things, for one the relatability factor each of the character were delivering racism to someone off camera but it really felt like it was to us; this is relatable because we've all probably had that unpleasant experience of being talked negatively to our face not just racist comments but also prejudicial ones from bullies.I remember one time there was one guy in my high school that talked smack to me, despite at the time just simply talking with my friends before my next class and not even knowing this guy; I remember after he left I thought \"what the hell was his problem?\" Seriously, to this day I still don't know what his problem was as I really had nothing to do with whatever troubled him. And that's the point as something is clearly eating at each of the characters but they're not dealing with it, instead are just taking it out on anyone that's an easy target.Another think about that montage is these negative comments are from different people of different races, which shows that racism is a disease. As it's become a pandemic that has hit the neighborhood hard and as the summer heat gets hotter so does the hate and the spread gets wider.The film has a colorful assortment of characters that don't feel like caricatures, or characters you would see on your typical 80's sitcom but people that you feel could exist, that you could easily pass by every day. As each have strengths and weaknesses and are entirely classified in one side good or evil but are just people that are getting though the day. Let alone I really like the casting in this film which has one of the best ensembles I've ever seen, some of cast consists of people before they even became big names and stars, which makes this film even more special.There are some characters I'll admit I just didn't like (which is part of the point of them) and not because of race mind you but because some of them were just blowholes for no reason.From Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) whom despite not talking much in the film, is just an obnoxious blowhole and the constant blaring of his music sort of reflect that. The guy is the walking definition of a Narcissist or could be one, I do think it's possible as he does exhibit a few of the signs. From his constantly blaring music he walks around with, he does this obviously to just get attention.But also, one scene where he goes to the Korean mini grocery store to buy batteries for his boom box, but he is just being rude to the clerk and his wife because they're not doing service fast enough in his mind. I get the guy is young, but he's a grown adult, so it honestly wouldn't kill him to exercise good manners and patience, let alone it's not like he's in a rush to go anywhere as throughout the film he has really gone much of anywhere. That little scene just shows one part of narcissism which is when they don't always get their way, they would treat other people badly until they do. And sadly, like with all narcissists this road Radio is walking will lead to some very bad things in the end.Buggin (Giancarlo Esposito) whom is just a total jerk from beginning to end. He's true to his name as he just buggin out most of the time, just raises the biggest and stupidest stinks over nothing of any real importance. I remember half the time thinking \"seriously doesn't this guy have anything better to do or a job to go to?\" He's obviously an attention getter to and is doing this not for a good cause but just to booster his ego, make himself big.Buggin and Radio Raheem have one thing in common, neither of them throughout the film has done anything productive throughout the day as both don't have a job or not one, I know about, let along jack squat with their days and maybe even lives. Both look like their people that have just way too much time on their hands. From this there it's probably created a sense of powerlessness and from starting a hate campaign, they use it give themselves a sense of empowerment. But it doesn't empower it only makes them weaker, it gives the person the illusion of power and as soon as the hate runs its course, the illusion shatters and they become exactly who they were before powerless.The film never quite finds the cause of hate as the characters themselves probably don't know why. But really part of how it can easily germinate and easy it is to succumb to it mainly from the sense of powerlessness and the need to feel powerful.But also from hypocrisy, there is a lot of it going on in the film, despite the title of the film no one we see really does the right thing but really the wrong thing. There is this song that constantly plays called \"Fight the Power\" but no one does, instead they fight people that are actually in the same position as them with no power which is part of what makes the film sad.Though there are some characters that I like that I feel seem like good natured people despite not perfect. One particular interesting one and my favorite is the Mayor played well by the late Ozzie Davis. He's character is obviously down on his luck and he's aware of it but he doesn't let it get him down. I like there is some humor to him as in part of the film, he is search of the right alcohol to drink as he hates lite beer, I could empathize a little as I'm not a big fan of decaf but even all of us every day are always in search of that one good thing that makes life worth living and better in a sense.His character is true to his name as he really is a voice of reason in the film. I really love how truthful he is as he knows he's made mistakes but he admits to them and never rubs his nose in others. But also his great amount of wisdom, like what he says near the end of the film to the community on regret which is deep as he's someone that knows all about regret.The ending is haunting as it really leaves you with a feeling of uncertainty and unease because despite life going on in the midst of tragedy and disaster, nothing is the same anymore. In only one season and a short span of time everything can change forever. Hopefully just like the season of nature, when change comes, we'll make sure their positive.Even like both different monologues at the end credits which were by Dr. Martin Luther King and Malcom X which have stayed with me forever. I always carry them with me to never forget my continuing struggle against prejudice and injustice.We must let love win against hate, or we will have nothing left to live for.Rating: 4 stars.",

Spike Lee shows all of the characters and how they react with one another and how most of them deal with racism. The main character is Mookie and we see how he deals with racism from one of his fellow employees and how racism is hidden within most of the people he knows. We see in one scene where two police men drive by three black men and the camera moves in on a close-up and shows the expressions on all of their faces and you see the hate in all of their faces which says a lot. You find out in the end why the three black men show so much anger towards the police men, just by the expressions on their faces. The main idea of the movie is do the right thing in the toughest of situations because what you do can end up affecting people around you, especially when it involves racism. This is a movie that everyone should see because we don't put enough thought into judging other people of different color and this movie shows the hate that we all have inside of us. Sometimes we don't even see our own racism until we get into a situation that truly tests our judgment towards people just by the color of their skin.",

Some will argue that the climax of the film played out as a way to protect Sal, but any keen observer will note that despite Mookie's calculated decision, there was absolutely zero indication that anybody other than Radio Raheem was on his mind.Taking a step back into observing the film as a whole, I must be forthright in saying that these films do not speak to me on a personal level in the way it may to many others. I'm not black. I didn't grow up in an urban environment, and I'm not oppressed in any substantial way. It's with this context that I was unable to appreciate the content of the film fully.There is much I disliked about the film. The acting worked the extremes. Lee's acting was wooden and tedious while the other bit characters were so overblown that I had a hard time taking them serious. Buggin' Out instigates the entire plot with a grievance that forces even the most progressive mind to question the logic. Here is an Italian pizzeria with pictures of Italian-Americans on the wall, what sense would it make to arbitrarily put anybody else up there? Conceding to the fact that there are indeed individuals out there who would want a representative of their community based on principle, why escalate the issue to such a degree? My content issues are surely subjective and considering my lack of social empathy I'm open to accepting the fact I just can't relate.Despite the number of little things I didn't like about the film, the thing I liked most about the film and the thing that allows me to like the film overall is the dialog. This film was incredibly well written. No matter how poorly many of the lines were delivered, the fact remains that the social consciousness of this film and the impact it has had on society is incredible. Whether it's the in your face cultural clash of Italian-Americans and African-Americans, or the police ineptness, there is plenty of conversation material still relevant today.",

This movie was so artistically done from the extremely fascinating cinematography to the dramatic disturbances of racism and story. This movie is really interesting to try and analyze, primarily because were not sure exactly what message Spike Lee is trying to Convey. The movie being in a black neighborhood during the late 80's early 90's you'd think the movie would be all about black racism. However I found Spike Lee to be psychologically reversing it. Instead I as the audience, a white male, felt for the movie. I felt that Lee was conveying an over powering black world that is unwelcoming to any opposite races. Instead of blacks being discriminated against, whites and other ethnicities were. It was a total reverse effect. They wanted \"brothers\" on the wall in Sal's pizza joint, but didn't really approve of Sal and his Italian son's, because they weren't black. The emotion and anger I felt during the denouement of the movie was as if I was suffering from living in a racist community. This to me was so interesting to feel, the simple fact that black people were sort of the discriminators is such an interesting approach for a movie I thought it was great.

I do think that Radio Raheem should of turned his radio down instead of making the owner mad. But Sal had no right to smash the radio. This then led to a fight in the pizza shop.

The question arises did he do the right thing by starting the riot that led to a mob be hosed down by the fire department.

At times he seems to be sending a mixed message, as indicated by the contradictory epigrams quoting Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, and underneath all the distracting, Scorsese influenced visual camouflage his characters are likewise (believably) confusing and unpredictable. Lee dwells more on the consequences than the causes of the climactic riot, suggesting it was triggered in part by local businessman Danny Aiello's insensitivity to the changing face (from Italian to Black) of his Brooklyn neighborhood, without ever explaining how a corner pizzeria could pose such a threat to Black American culture.

I thought it would just be extremely gritty, with a lot of violence but no substence, like many similar movies. Well that is definitely half of the theme, but the other half is what hooked me. The other half is not pointed at Whites, but at the Blacks themselves.

It feels as if he's approaching the same topics he always addresses (racial tensions) but with far more subtlety; he does it almost perfectly- almost.I loved this film, far more so than anything else I've ever seen from Lee, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to almost anyone... but again, Lee's own heavy handedness keeps me from giving this a perfect score. In the last ten minutes I felt as if Lee sabotages a ton of the work he does by undermining the themes he's worked so hard to develop and leaving us with two diametrically opposed views. I can tell Lee was angry about the state of affairs when he made this film (and he's still angry), but it seems to me that he's not one-hundred-percent certain where to channel that anger. This film cemented in my mind the voice Lee truly does have. I think if he could learn to tone things back, even a little bit, he could make a masterpiece, but unfortunately, as thirty years of films following this movie have shown us, Lee doesn't seem to want to tone it back.",

The overall tone of the film is tension, tension between all the different races in this specific neighborhood in Brooklyn. The time elapsed in the film is one day, one very very hot day and Spike Lee does a great job of fitting the entire day into the film. In certain ways it seems as if this is a normal day in each actors' life but from the beginning the audience to sense that something is going to happen eventually. The suspense built up so slowly during the entire film. This is done by showing every characters' part in that process, Buggin' Out, played by Giancarlo Esposito, has an argument with Sal the shop owner and proceeds to incite other members of the neighborhood throughout the film. Mookie's strained relationship with Pino also hints at the films' ending action. Samuel L. Jackson was the film's part narrator and part moral voice during the film and that was very apparent during the riot and the hours following. The sets used in the film were very colorful and drew the audience in. The use of music was also a key component honing in on scenes that were especially tense. Radio Raheem carried his radio around the whole film playing, \"Fight the Power\" and during times of tension like the scene leading up to the riot and scenes in which two group of people were arguing he would walk through. The film was very contemporary and did a great job of showing the attitudes of the time in a very honest way.",

            "content": "This is one of those films that has something to say, but never quite says it.  It's a strange mix of very complex ideas with incredibly simplistic execution.  Unfortunately, racial politics seem to to effect attitudes toward the film as much as they are addressed within it--there seems to be a great need to say good things when there really isn't that much that's good about it. The first thing I noticed about the movie was the use of stereotypes--they're all here: An Italian-American pizza parlor owner, who evidently harbors secret racist feelings while at the same time lusting after a young African-American woman.  A lazy black delivery man (Mookie) who likes money but is more interested in having sex with his girlfriend than being a good worker.  A hard working Korean who owns a convenience store in the bad neighborhood who is distrustful of his patrons.  Add in a thuggish black who blasts Rap everywhere, a yuppie gentrifier,  a racist Italian, brutal cops, Ossie Davis as a drunk, ne'er do wells who seem to roam around the neighborhood with no jobs but lots of time to riot, and a few old guys sitting on the corner doing nothing but complaining.\nPerhaps the presence of all these stereotypes is supposed to get us to think about them, but unfortunately it tends to undermine the really quality acting by Aiello, Davis, Turturo and a number of others: Really top notch performances for characters who don't quite match the talents.  There are sparks of really, really good writing--for instance the scene where Mookie talks to Turturo about the latter's racial attitudes, hilarious and substantive at the same time.  But ultimately, the simplistic stereo types on the one hand -- which, had they come from another director, might be considered racist -- and the appropriate ambiguities of the plot on the other combine to make a sloppy mess of a movie without much direction.  Had Spike Lee waited a little to become more seasoned as a director, such an ambitious project might have been brought off.  He aimed high and so had a long way to fall. Still, the two positive things mentioned: Great performances all around with a few really well written scenes are more than you get in some movies.",

Italian American Sal (Danny Aiello) has run a popular pizza parlor for 25 years in the neighborhood. His sons, Pino (John Turturro) and Vito (Richard Edson), work with him. Their local delivery guy is Mookie (Spike Lee).Mookie has a sister, Jade (Joie Lee), and a Puerto Rican girlfriend, Tina (Rosie Perez), with whom he has a young son, Hector. Local characters include Mookie's friend, Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito), who resents that the pizzeria's \"Wall of Fame\" has only Italian Americans and no African Americans.

Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) is an older street presence with a generous spirit and alcohol problems. Mother Sister (Ruby Dee) is an older woman who watches all from her window.

Even if they had a small role, they were still significant. However, the most important and greatest part of the film was the message. It's evident, even today, that people are still intolerant towards other people's beliefs and cultures.

            "content": "I was shaken by the ending of Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. It took me so long to finally watch the movie which is shameful given today's climate and recent events. My first Lee film was 1988's School Daze. While I could see the talent, I was not impressed quite frankly. His next film did the trick. Lee was in complete control of the story. He knew how he wanted his story to progress but held his cards close to the chest. The first half, while you can sense some simmering tensions, was about getting to know a group of people and their sense of community. It was about people living their everyday lives. A slow-build with some fine comedy moments sprinkled in Lee's script. Then, he laid down the hammer as racial violence comes into play. It is hard to believe the movie came out in 1989. Some sequences are eerily reminiscent of what is happening in today's world. It goes to show how far (or not) we came as a society.I find it hilarious how Lee came up with the film's idea. Alfred Hitchcock Presents claimed that hot weather increases violent behavior. I can see that idea because I personally become more agitated if the weather is extremely hot. That combined with the 1986 Howard Beach racial incident and a police shooting allowed Lee to formulate his script. The film, when debuted at Cannes Festival, instantly became a controversial picture. Columnists stupidly claimed that the film will incite black people to riot. You can see why Lee was very frustrated by those comments. Despite being highly though of upon release, that stigma stayed with the film till present day. The final act is shocking, but it is just part of the power that came with the film.Mostly, Lee's film is about a bunch of people living their lives in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant. On this particular Sunday, it is the hottest day of the summer. Sal Fragione (Danny Aiello) is the owner of a pizzeria and has worked at the store every day for 25 years. The neighborhood used to be Italian-Americans but became home to African Americans and Hispanics over the years. His son, Pino (John Turturro) is openly racist and wants to move the pizzeria out of the neighborhood. Sal does not want to leave as he feels his pizzeria is part of the community. Then there was the complaint. Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) inquires why there are no pictures of black people on the restaurant's wall...just white Italian Americans. Now frustration and anger lead to violence that will ultimately change lives. In addition, we meet people like Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) who is the community's everyman, Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) whose \"Fight the Power\" on the boombox defines his life, the disc jockey (Samuel L. Jackson) that provides the running commentary, and Mookie (Spike Lee) who delivers pizzas.The ensemble cast is nothing short of excellent. Danny Aiello is the one with the most difficult role, and he plays it so well. The ending scene between his character and Mookie is a scene of acting brilliance...one that requires open-ended responses. This was not even Aiello's part to begin with. Lee lobbied hard for Robert De Niro, which would have been an excellent choice. Instead, Aiello delivered and received an Academy Award nomination in the process (one of the very few nominations and many people perceived as unfair). Everyone is great. Giancarlo Esposito as the local militant, Bill Nunn as a victim of injustice, and Rosie Perez makes her debut here (she did have a difficult time filming).Given everything going on in the world, it is important that Do the Right Thing is seen. Thirty years later, this is even more relevant and topical than ever. Lee has always been known to show anger in his movies. You see that here, but there is also some love and hope. Lee created a community with different types of people which means different solutions to the problem whether its militant violence or peaceful pieties. Different people use different methods to react to one situation which escalated the powerful ending. As a New Yorker, I understand what the characters are going through. Gentrification has become a problem for the city. That is only scratching the surface, but that's an argument for another place and time. The movie itself is important, but it is well-made. It is beautifully shot by Ernest R. Dickerson who did a great job making the city look hotter than any desert. Lee created a movie that is confident and not afraid of any controversy. That is why people watch the film all these years later.My Grade: A-",

After watching it again last night I realize it was still just OK, even though everybody else in the world thinks it is some kind of super movie here to bring the struggles and views of the poor black into the homes of the average American. But after some offhanded remarks and resultant discussion with the(Japanese) wife  I realized that Mr. Lee may still be the giant egotist we all know and love but I don't believe this was directed so much towards the mainstream, as it was towards the poor black youth who blames all his troubles on everybody else and consequently acts with questionable wisdom. (not unlike the racial reversal Travolta film 'White Mans Burden')Of course you can go on forever talking about how racism is bad, and stereotype this and negativity that, but as Mookie shows us what he doesn't learn, it all comes down to (money?) doing the right thing. This chronically late worker, not in school, absent father gets mad at the perceived wrong committed by his employer and incites a riot. While certainly being an easy thing to do, I can find no circumstance within the movie that justifies this as being the right thing to do. For the black youth looking for the right thing to do, the messages are pretty clear:1. Get a job2. Dont beat up the dorky white guy for accidently scuffing your devastatingly important Nikes3. Be a little considerate and turn down the radio.4. Sal and Co. aren't out to get you, and if you dont like em,5. Save your money, open your own pizza shop, put whoever you want on the wall.Lee expands on this further with 'Clockers', where the kid escapes from his block at the end. But for the majority of contemporary viewers I feel this movie just follows standard Hollywood formulas of:  excessive foul language, (thankfully few) immature sexual references , and constant and unabated conflict that leaves you quite tired by the end of the film.While this movie rates as only OK with me I gave it a '7' for the excellent acting and honest representation of peoples feelings towards situations that exists in Brooklyn today.

I was also pleasantly surprised by Spike Lee's acting ability, I had no idea that he could act along with everything else that he can do. I was very sucked into the film and definitely the Character of Mookie, although I had a love/hate view of him.

This is a film you can watch 10 different times and think something new about it each time. Spike Lee knows this and that is what makes it so good. The question is, did Mookie do the right thing?",

            "content": "I was hooked from the very beginning. Rosie Perez dancing to Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\" is probably one of my favorite opening credits of all-time now. I love it. It sets up the style of the rest of the film with all the tacky bright colored clothes popular in the late 80's early 90's, laid over a warm backdrop of colors that you can feel sizzling until the very end.So this is Spike Lee's magnum opus, if you will -- his presentation and powerful commentary on race relations and riots. In the sweltering heat, tensions rise between a black neighborhood and the Italian-American owners of Sal's Famous in the Bed-Stuy area of Brooklyn. (a third \"race\"/party also exists, Koreans that own a convenient store in the neighborhood, although they are less prominent in the story). Come the end, we question who is right, who is wrong, did Mookie do the right thing? When you watch it, don't deny that you try to come up with answers -- it's just natural to attempt to decide which party is in the wrong. But wait, Spike Lee remains unbiased as he unfolds the story, letting us see that both sides cause extensive and unfixable damages. The fact that we, a people, attempt to even analyze events to decipher who is more wrong enforces his message that he conveys in this film.Paul Haggis should've seen this before making Crash and he should've taken very careful notes. Spike Lee fleshes out his characters, giving them depth and dimension; they have reason to their emotions and actions. Concerning the screenplay, the conflict is a steady build-up of minor/major events that just blow up in your face -- no melodrama, no \"clever\" plot twists and manipulations. Lastly, he doesn't forcibly shove his message in your face. Remember, Spike Lee didn't make this movie to incite urban riots. He made it to promote tolerance... and I believe it works VERY well if you look at it in the right light.",

Spike Lee really came off as an auteur director for this film, and that really comes out with the unique editing and bold cinematography/lighting choices. The movie itself provides a slow build of tension that constantly made me question when and how things would go wrong. The various characters are extremely tangible and easy to sympathize with.

            "content": "I wrote this review in 1989, before IMDb existed. That's why I'm submitting it now, with updates to reflect recent news story that this film addressed.Nearly two months after its release, and after reading numerous articles about it, I finally saw Do the Right Thing. It's a remarkably entertaining, enlightening, controversial, and well balanced view of race relations in an inner city neighborhood (Bed-Stuy). The story in brief: Sal (Danny Aiello) and his two sons (including John Turturro) operate a pizzeria in Bed-Stuy that caters to blacks and other ethnic minorities. Mookie, who delivers pizzas and is played by Spike Lee, is the only black employee in the store. There are numerous interesting side stories: \u0095 Mookie's relationship with his sister, his Hispanic girlfriend and their son. \u0095 The relationship between Da Mayor (Ossie Davis) and his attempt to win the affection of a neighborhood woman (Ruby Dee) \u0095 The interaction between Sal and his two sons. The characters are developed fully, and we see them at regular intervals throughout the film as the director builds our empathy for all of them, warts and all. These include the slick D.J., Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn), who is never seen without his ghetto-blaster (A large, portable, radio cassette player, measuring about 1.5 m wide & 1.0 m high. It's played especially outdoors, in public places at loud volume; & carried on one shoulder with loudspeakers facing the head; since replaced by today's mobile devices), and Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito), an outspoken person in the community. The movie's strength comes from its acting, realism, and how it challenges us to re-examine our attitudes on race relations. This movie could serve as an excellent vehicle for schools and community groups to discuss race relations and defuse violence. Here are some discussion questions: \u0095 Was it reasonable for Buggin' Out, one of the more activist blacks in the film, to insist that Sal put the pictures of some \"brothers\" on the walls of his pizzeria? \u0095 Were the police accurately portrayed as all-white, bigoted and insensitive to the needs of the community? Or were they stereotyped? (This film predated the \"stop & frisk\" and \"police brutality\" charges that would emerge decades later.) \u0095 Were African-Americans shown to be unusually belligerent to the only two whites we meet outside the pizzeria, the Yuppie owner of brownstone, and 50-ish owner of an antique car?Concerning the series of events that led to the riot at the end, \u0095 Was the riot caused by Radio Raheem's defiance in Sal's pizzeria, first by entering a closed shop, and then by blasting his radio inside, knowing how offensive Sal would find it? \u0095 Was Sal's destruction of the radio justified on the grounds that he was provoked beyond the breaking point? \u0095 When the fight between Raheem and Sal broke out, should Mookie, who was close to both of them, have interceded? \u0095 Should the group of local blacks have stopped the fight, since both Sal and Raheem were liked by both? \u0095 During the fight, was it realistic that no weapons were produced? \u0095 When the police arrived, did they use unreasonable force to restrain Raheem, or were they misled by his size and strength from realizing that they were choking him to death? (This film was decades before the Eric Garner case that presented very similar circumstances.) \u0095 After Raheem's death, which was not Sal's fault, was Mookie justified in breaking Sal's window? Was the looting of Sal's pizzeria understandable, if not forgivable? \u0095 Was the ending regarding Mookie and Sal believable? \u0095 Should there have been coverage of black prejudice against other groups to parallel the bias shown by Sal's sons toward blacks? Considering all possible biases that could have been shown, the movie is reasonably well-balanced to show them all. There are some especially meaningful dialogues about racial attitudes: Between Sal and his bigoted son, between Sal and Mookie, between Mookie and the son, and between the white police officers and Sal. Each tests our deepest beliefs about race relations, and there is a fair balance between moderate and extreme views. Movies exploring this important topic have become scarce in recent years. One notable exception was Crash, which won the Best Picture Oscar in 2005.Do the Right Thing has excellent camera work, direction, pacing, characterization, music and authenticity. Not quite a masterpiece, but it is so rich, daring and unusual, that it's a must-see for those interested in the inner city of today. See it, enjoy it, and most importantly, discuss it with friends and those on both sides of the issues!",

            "content": "This film is probably Spike Lee's most definitive piece of work in cinema. It is arguably his best as well. This film helped revolutionize black cinema for the modern era of film, but what was really cool about Spike Lee, was he came in at a time, that still utilized classic filmmaking techniques. A bridge from old film directing theories to modern Hollywood story-telling. He is a true auteur and definitely can make an artistic movie. He makes this modern-day (1980s), film about life in a section of Brooklyn, where race tensions are a little high, the summer heat is at 100 and they need to coexist together, but Lee's style captures the color, shapes and composition, as if it was, West Side Story (1961).As Samuel L. Jackson (Mr. Senor Love Daddy), does his radio show transmission from the center of town, the rest of the area goes about its daily business. Many brilliantly crafted characters are established along the way. Spike Lee takes the main role as Mookie, a pizza delivery guy, working at Sal's (Danny Aiello), Pizza, at the center of town. From here various other plot arcs unfold involving a wide-range of ethnic characters that live among the few blocks around the pizza place. While some are trying to keep the basic flow of life going, like love, family, responsibility and money, they also have to fight against the dark side of this urban city life. A side containing racial tensions, money woes, sobriety, territorial dominance and anger. Plus, the temperature is 100 degrees, which just drives up the irritable mood felt throughout the movie.This symphony of cinema, about urban city life, is beautifully crafted, not only visually, but the song choices are perfect and the film flows nicely. This is totally the case with Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn), as he carries around his boom box, totally picking the perfect songs for the situation involved. Without giving anything away, this symphony rolls through a small summer boil into an inferno of anger, confusion and tragedy. Spike Lee captures a world full of color, his characters situated in artful compositions and clever situations made up for the talented cast.Veteran actor Ossie Davis, plays Da Mayor, the old local drunk, who wanders the streets looking for redemption. Bill Nunn's Raheem, who is the boom box carrying, street intimidator, who's fighting the power. Rosie Perez as Mookie's girlfriend. John Turturro gives a convincingly, irritating performance as Pino, the agitating, thickheaded, racist son of Sal's. That just names a few of the great talents, that help make this film one of the best from the 1980s. It is a true representation of late 20th century filmmaking at its best.9.0 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",

Most of the movie is following a mundane day in the life of a bunch of very flawed characters, and centers around all of the people on a street in Brooklyn's Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood on the hottest day of the year. The characters are generally rude, lazy, and ignorant, and very real in a way. Lee didn't sugarcoat anything in this movie, and the effect was real and powerful. The last sequence of the movie shifts from an aimless day to a race, and police brutality fueled riot that rocks the neighborhood. It was an odd turn for a movie to take so rapidly, and the violence, hate, and destruction that resulted leaves you full of sorrow, and questions. How things went so bad so fast is unsettling, and Lee does a great job of provoking the questions, and not giving you any answers. He showed you who the characters were, and what they did, but he won't hold your hand on why it happened. Even the title begs the question of what the right thing was and who could've or should've done it. This film was exceptional because Lee lulls the audience to sleep with normalcy, then shocks you with events that are very real and difficult to watch. That combination will leave you thinking about this film and searching for answers long after it ends, which I believe was Lee's plan all along.",

While I could sympathize with Sal and the fact that he was a proud Italian, I also know that given his customers were black, he could have reaches a compromise. This film is incredibly well made and packs a huge punch. Honestly I HOPE white audiences were made uncomfortable. What they see in this film is not a stretch from how the black community is treated, despite the milestones we've reached as a whole, racism is still at thing, and it is still ugly and cancerous. This film shows just how racism affects a community as a whole, even when 90% of that community is a known oppressed race.",

            "content": "Spike Lee is one of the most beloved albeit controversial filmmakers of our time, with plenty of films under his belt that have either won over or divided audiences. His best work is known for analyzing racial tensions, contemporary media, urban crime and political dilemmas, all by peeling away the layers of life to reveal the brutal hypocrisies it offers. Arguably the film that really punched critics and audiences in the gut with such raw themes was Do the Right Thing, as it became one of if not the most critically acclaimed film of 1989, and for good reason.Set on a hot summer day, the story focuses on the simmering racial tension in a Brooklyn neighborhood amongst the African Americans and Italian Americans, which soon turns to tragedy and rampage. With this in mind, the major cultural differences are prevalent throughout, but at no point does the film scrutinize one side only. While there are multiple characters around, each one shares their own perspective on life and race, thus rendering a connection to the viewers. The iconic words \"love\" and \"hate\" really do summarize the film well, as it's not good to use violence to solve your problems, yet it's also not immoral to use it in self defense. Admittedly, some of the archs do drag on, but it's no more to add in to the climax of the film, which to this day still has us debating on whether or not the main character Mookie did the right thing.In addition to how full of personality the characters are, the dialogue is also packed to the brim with distinct street talk. Whether it'd be Mookie's interactions with his \"brothers\" or Sal and his boys, or the daily residents just talking to one another, the verbal language practically invents how the characters think, making them very relatable as well. From a visual standpoint, the style adds in to the film's vibrant nature. The decision to shoot with mostly deep reds really makes one feel the heat that the Brooklyn residents were experiencing. The usage of viewpoints and angles are done to great effect, as they add in to the tumultuous and unpredictable tone displayed throughout the feature. For one of his first features, Lee really knew how to be playful with the equipment needed.So needless to say, while it may be hard to stomach at times, Do the Right Thing succeeds in displaying the honest nature of urban culture in Lee's hometown of Brooklyn. You can say the film is really just an incitement, but dig a little deeper and you'll realize that it does not condone violence as much as it speaks on the circumstances of what could lead to violence. Alongside having hilarious character banter and an exuberant film-making stance, the film manages to be powerful without inducing a moral ground. The people in this film are not perfect at all, but their feelings and emotions are what make them resonate with us as individuals. Remember, if you simply can't understand the way someone feels, what makes your outlook any better?",

Our hero Mookie has a young child with possibly the loudest female in the world, so must take a job at the local pizzeria to make ends meet (and to preserve his hearing). The restaurant is run by a white Italian American family, which stands in stark contrast to the racial make-up of it's surroundings. Tensions start to stir when one of the customers notices there's no black faces in the eatery's American Hall Of Fame photo section, and when the owner refuses to redress the situation, the spark is lit on a simmering explosive. It all kicks off at closing time... And Mookie finds himself slap bang in the middle. At one point, he has a crucial decision to make. What will he do? We home in directly into the lives of this diverse cast of people, young and old alike, during a sweltering 24 hour period in their small urban project. Most are just going about their business, and their everyday conversations and routines are surprisingly interesting to behold There is a rich vein of humour here, and a real sense of life in motion. All are dragged into the central conflict as the film goes on, whether they like it or not. Things will never be the same again... but could things have been handled differently? Of course, but when things escalate to this extent, all common sense goes out of the window.

This leads to the delivery boy Mookie, an African American stuck between doing what is right for his neighborhood, or what is right for his job.The ending of this film is powerful. The scene where all the locals destroy the pizza shop is so emotional. It all starts when Mookie breaks the pizza shop window. The effects were very realistic such as the fires, and garbage everywhere, the riots, and the firemen hosing down the men responsible. It is very sad to see the aftermath of the riot as well. All the characters played their roles perfectly, with all the emotion necessary.Overall I feel as though Mookie did NOT do the right thing. He should have tried to break up the riot, and explain to his neighbors why there were only Italians on the wall, and explain how much love Sal really did have for all the people.

Throughout much of the film I was unsure of whether or not I liked it, but the last 30minutes of the film brought it all together. The end was bone-chilling and captivating. Do the Right Thing was deliberately provocative, and told from the point of view of the African American director. The story easily evokes emotion from a spectrum of ethnicity's. The film was well made, and created to seem realistic, but there is a sort of stylized quality to it. There are a few moments where things feel quite unrealistic, but for the most part, the camera makes you feel like you are involved in their conversations. The camera even broke the 4th wall a lot. So the big question is, did Mooky do the right thing? Depends on who you agree with, Malcolm X or Martin Luther King. He thought he was doing the right thing by throwing the trash can in the window, since the police had killed Raheem. Mooky stood up for his \"family\". But what's heartbreaking about the end, is that just before everything escalated, Sal said Mooky was just like a son to him. Do the Right Thing is a great representation of how different cultures clash and come together. It's heartfelt, humorous, and mind-opening.",

In his masterpiece, if you choose to call it that, he showcases all the colorful and different personalities that can be found in one block of the bed-stuy section of Brooklyn. The film itself is technically and visually arresting, but the inherent message leaves something to be desired in my opinion. The tools that Lee uses: breaking the fourth wall in an effort to appeal directly to the audience, the contrasted social scenes with varying people of different backgrounds all apparently co-existing until this fateful day, as well as the use of both diegetic and non-diegetic sound to guide the film are all excellent. Radio Raheem and his boom-box set the stage for the showdown, but my problem is how blatantly obvious the outcome was. What further vexes me is that Lee admittedly changed the film's script to include the inter-race drama, as the first working version of the script did not contain the same animosity towards Sal and his sons. I like the camera-work of the film, steady most of the time, with a few variations thrown in here and there. The misc-en-sene of the film is all around you, you feel the heat, start to slowly bob to the music and feel for the characters plight, and then Spike Lee throws racism into the mix. This is where the film lost me. The whole incident itself (Raheem's death) could have been completely avoidable, but obviously what happened happened. That for me personally was the worst part of the film. Furthermore, the fact that Mookie is the one who seemingly incites the second m\u00eal\u00e9e by breaking out the window makes even less sense. Obviously Spike Lee's character is supposed to be the omniscient one, the one who is above it all and can look at the bigger picture. But I did not get that feeling from the performance itself, I only felt that it was implied. This film is great in its own way, and when asked the question of whether or not the people in the crowd did \"right thing,\" I said yes because once the die had been cast, there was no other possible course of action. That being said, I believe that the world that existed in that film would find itself with very little in common with today, over 20 years later. The world, while certainly still full of hate and bigotry, is changing for the better, and maybe it takes a screwed up racist film like this to do it. That is kind of sad. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone and everyone.",

It it moving because throughout the film, certain situations are touched upon that were very blown up years ago. But, throughout, one realizes that how these situations are handled aren't the best way to go about solving the problems. It is also very upsetting at the end to see the Riot scene and know that the racism and in some ways, hatred of other races really existed. Also, how people were treated when they would stand up for what they believed in and how they felt. It was upsetting but also moving to me that we have mostly come a long way in accepting freedom of speech and we are a multicultural country, and that we are more open eyed when it comes to new situations. Such as voting an African American man to be our President. This movie's meaning is stated in the title, \" Do the Right Thing,\" and the older man in the movie definitely helps the other characters realize that we need to accept people for who they are.",

But it sends a good message and makes some good points. The actors were excellent and the plot and storyline were great.Spike Lee did a great job filming the movie on one block in the city and creating the feel of a boiling hot summer day. Using orange paint to create the mise-en-scene of the stifling hot day work. The actors looked sweaty and uncomfortable in the heat and the whole set made the feeling of stifling and hot. The film was fast paced and had good editing. It ran smoothly and didn't really have a slow moment. Lee didn't go into too much detail nor did he give too much detail to give a bias. The temporal relationship was good and covered one day which was really cool how he covered one day in the movie. The music was great, especially Radio Rahim's boom box. Every time Rahim was on screen his boom box played Fight the Power which was perfect for the whole message of the movie. Another notable piece of camera-work was the closeup Lee used on his characters, especially with Radio Rahim and Sal in the end before the big riot.This movie was excellent, great camera-work with a great controversial message that really put Lee under the microscope and scrutiny.",

A lot of others say it was about the radio. I don't know who to agree with more, but I know for a fact that I can't disagree with any of them! The film was genius in the way that there was no moral to the story-line. Another great aspect of the film was the camera-work. I honestly haven't seen a film like that, where the characters are talking INTO the camera, as if the viewers are part of the movie. Or as if the camera was telling the story. The low angles on the taller people to show how tall and big and empowering they can be; the high angles on the shorter people to show how short and small they can appear made it very clear and an easy way to understand the things that the director, producer, AND editor wanted the audience to see.

The characters would sometimes be abrasive, but ultimately it would be resolved and all was well. But then the ending completely took me by surprise. It was not at all what I had expected, I almost couldn't believe it. The character that I originally thought would cause a huge problem, did not. Instead an entirely different scenario occurred. This film was just amazing and powerful. It had great messages about racism and violence. I think more people would benefit from watching this today.

Now, try to compare this film to any other films out there, even his own.  I cannot think of one single other film out there that really gets into the issue of racism and presents an intelligent analysis of it quite so well as this one.  Do the Right Thing takes on this issue of racism and shows us all the complications and complexities of it. What is the right thing?  For each culture it is something completely different.  And the right thing can simultaneously be the wrong thing.  No character is without flaw, no character is without redeeming qualities. Someday I hope this film will be recognized for the brilliant work it is. Do the Right Thing needs to be placed up there with other similar groundbreaking or landmark films like Midnight Cowboy, Cool Hand Luke, or The Best Years of Our Lives.

It is an intolerable crime from a director - to make You think!One step at a time: the story You know, if You don't - watch the movie, do the right thing! Memorable performance by Ossie Davies - he is there between decent, hopeful and slightly schizophrenic, true leader, albeit an out of touch, stepped-over one - masterful! Aiello is doing wonderful job, getting just the right mixture of pride, weariness, pain and tenderness (oh yes! just think \"All I see is kids growing\") into part of Sal. Turturro is brilliant as his son - the \"angry\" one, full of hate which comes out of his self-shame. Edson, on the other hand, is not so much a good-at-heart sissy as the part suggests, but just plain weak, playing stereotype of a high-pitched crybaby.One could argue that Perez' acting is standard\\stereotyped, but I'd say she sets the standard here more then reprises it. Benjamin, Faison and Harris are the right spice for the hood, improvising their chat as the everlasting \"3 men at the corner\". Esposito's \"Banging out\" makes a cheap hissy fit out of his life - and is precise,satirical and convincing at this. \"RadioRaheem\", who sees his life as statement, though I think he really forgets sometimes what is the statement supposed to be about, is not so much played convincingly by Bill Nunn, as filmed brilliantly by Spike. And talking about the master - here is Spike in the middle of things as Mookie, watching, surveying, judging and (very subtly) pitying. He is making Mookie the \"author\" who creates a situation with a hint then leans back and writes it down for the future to learn the past's misdeeds. He stays relatively cool through the movie, his anger is controlled and sad. Even in the (in)famous scene where he throws the trash can into pizzeria window, I've got a feeling he does that to provoke the crowd and watch their reaction. Finally, Mr. S.L.Jackson comments not so much on the happening on screen as on the thoughts in YOUR head induced by the said happening. What You want to whisper in the ear of the one watching the film beside You - oops, he is again ahead of You. So - how does it work for us(at least for me)? I quote from the Biography for Spike Lee on IMDb: \"DtRT sparked a debate on racial relations, and exactly where Lee was taking the film.\" This cursed question - where IS he taking it, and us alongside? Well, first I'd say the questions are more important then answers, he just asks - and we figure it for ourselves, each in our own unique way (see my post-answer \"Questions instead of Answers\" on the \"Jungle Fever\" board). He does it in broad, almost exaggerated, pop-art-like propaganda style, reminding (only in some of its aspects) of early Almodovar without the surreal. Camera-work is dry and intense, the dialog, while seemingly relaxed, reeks of tension, which is built up so masterfully, that we hardly see it coming. Now my version of the answer is: all of us at some point lack the courage, the intelligence, the plain decency to choose \"doing the right thing\". Now, Bugging Out at some point in his life had this choice (just an example): 1. do I take the hard way of opening my business where the walls will be covered by the Afro-American heroes; 2. do I make the hard decision to accept that I can't make the business due to circumstances, whatever they may be, as well as accepting the fact that Italian pizzeria has the Italians smiling from the walls, which does not mean they disrespect Afro-Americans; 3. do I take the easy way out - hating all those who show their admiration for THEIR heroes just because I have no special place to show admiration I have for mine. The list goes on. Are Afro-Americans guilty of the mockery Pino has to endure from his friends - or does the problem lie elsewhere, in the fact that his only criteria for the right and wrong comes from cheap, drunk tongues and empty heads of his posse? Does Sal have to let his frustration run ahead of him, or can he keep civil tongue, being aware as a businessman of experience, that a civil word may sometimes put out a fire? Are Korean shop-owners guilty of the fact that the three at the corner have no money for the beer (said beverage being the actual reason)? Is Radio Raheem the reason for the cop's unendurable hated work in a hated neighborhood, or is he just the outlet for the scorn and anger the cop feels towards himself for being a failure (at least in his own eyes). Oh, and, incidentally, whom DOES Raheem love\\hate, does he remember at all?They all had\\have their choices. None of them met it quite right. Now how long are we gonna stay weak and indulge ourselves in the easy decisions with fatal results? How long are we gonna excuse ourselves in the idiotic \"They started it first\", \"Everyone around me expects it from me\", \"I'm not a sissy - I won't give in, hell, I won't budge!\" sort of behavior!? Mr. Spike Lee does not give an answer to that - he knows not himself. However, his outlook is gloomy, and as much as I want to be hopeful, I cannot bring a convincing argument against his hopelessness. Except for this: maybe - just maybe - some of us, after watching this incredibly powerful, bitter and truthful movie, will be disturbed enough to restrain at least for a short time from unthinkingly doing the wrong thing just because it's easier or\\and in accord with what the close environment expects from us. So, for this hope I say THANK YOU MR.LEE - SERIOUSLY GOOD JOINT!!!",

Everyone gives a strong performance and causes the viewer to feel engaged in the film's concentrated plot. Every person in the film seems real. I loved the beginning sequence of the film. The girls' dancing was entertaining and a great way illustrate the time period of the film. Do the Right Thing is extremely emotional. The concept and plot is a touchy subject, and Lee clearly casts himself as Mookie to reveal his views on the issues at hand. This is a wise decision, for Lee effectively plays the confused, yet passionate character. Mookie is a very complex character whom one must thoroughly analyze in order to somewhat understand. In addition, the coloring of the film was intense, which added to what was going on on screen.Although the racial tension was extremely disturbing and strong, it was accurately depicted. It was heartbreaking to watch the cops strangle Radio Raheem. It was if the cop subconsciously knew he was killing the boy, but just could not stop himself. The riot was especially upsetting, for everything went out of control because different ethnic groups could not get along. Spike Lee does a great job of recuperating after the film's wild climax. The viewer feels a huge sense of relief after the horrible and severe fight scene is over, and Lee shows that the community has calmed down as well.

Because, instead of having this film being an ideal or a \"portrayal\", his film I can feel is the real deal. Many portrayals nowadays take artistic liberties or clean something up to make it more appropriate for viewing audiences, or more intense to shock them. Even though this film was made over 20 years ago, with the recent spike of public interest in the \"Black lives matter\" movement, we can all connect to this film in someway. Whether we are taking direction or passive action, standing up and observing, or simply just having a stereotype or certain ways of thinking and feeling expected of you due to the color of your skin. In this film, we have Mookie. He's African American, and everyone at his job, is Caucasian. The owner as well as the owner's sons/employees. There's a Korean mart across the street. And the neighborhood is predominantly occupied by African Americans. So in Lee's film, he explores the tension and day-to-day interactions by this close proximity of mixed skin colors and races in his 1989 film, Do The Right Thing.",

The film was a love note to Brooklyn. You literally felt the sweltering heat throughout the entire film, a number of times I felt like I ought to wipe my forehead. I think it was admirably honest about race-relations, and I liked how it didn't just concentrate on the racism and ignorance of certain white people but also the sad anger and senselessness of some black people and interestingly enough I think we can identify with all of that, there aren't any clear explanations or messages in the film, in fact the ending feels hopeless but it begs our attention and asks us to look around.",

That doesnt take away that this is by far Spike Lee's best movie with a landslide. The boiling point for a humans mind is about 50 celcius, which is what we got here. Just about everyone is screaming to eachother in a movie were the cinematopgrapher makes everything seem boiling hot. The center of this universe is Italian; Sal's Famous Pizzeria, were Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) comes by daily to rant about \"no brothers on the wall\". Eventually everything will go to hell by the end of the very hot day, excallating in a police officer chocking ghettoblaster local Radio Raheem to death. The message in the mayhem is clear; violence and hate creates more of the same, although the quote on the end screen from Malcolm X could easily be confused that Spike Lee actually have nothing against violence under the \"right circumstanses\". Maybe not the best quote after seeing a man killed and a restaurant destroyed? Anyway, in spite of the horrendous outcome, Do The Right Thing is a work of art, a beautiful movie filled with excellent actors. Years later, many scenes would probably have been deleted or cut down, but here, we get the full story of a Hood on boiling point. Not just the tragedy, but fleshed out relationships. The best scene stealers are Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee as Da Mayor and Mother Sister. And that's the truth! Fight the power.",

I think the intention was to get people talking about it in the first place. From there, I don't think any actual conclusions were made, it was left mostly ambiguous. There is no 'correct' answer. This leaves the audience accountable for their interpretations. Spike Lee presents an evocative piece, but it doesn't necessarily lean one way or the other. He tells the story and any leaves the audience to their own thoughts. You could probably tell a lot about a person, just based on their interpretation. Aside from all this, I really enjoyed the cinematography. It was incredibly effective in conveying the heat, and the painted on color was just crazy! But great all the same.

Some of them are good, some bad, but no matter what, you feel that they are real. As the story unveils you get to know more and more of each of them: what drives them, why bothers them about their place in life and other people around them. Some say that Spike Lee shots nothing but racial movies, but I don't think he takes any sides. Look at each side in this story, each of them has their own skeletons in their closet and each was ultimately responsible for the events the movie led up to. Well, as I mentioned at the start of this little review, I really can't describe this movie good enough. The story, the casting, the direction and even colouring, are all brilliant.

During a time when people of different ethnicities were at constant odds with one another and the law only served as another source of racist oppression it seemed there was no answer to the uproar that was ensuing around different races. The film illustrates the white attitude toward blacks in inner city ghettos and how black attempts at retaliation erupted more violence and racist attitudes. Director Spike Lee depicts how local Italian Americans were discriminate against blacks that they felt were infiltrating their neighbors, the local cops abusing their power to carry out race bias actions, and there was no way maintaining order or peace. It was significance because this issue was extremely controversial and uninvolved citizens often turned a blind eye to what was going on. In the years that followed the film the type of mayhem that occurred in reality with events such as the L.A. Riots.

            "content": "Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing\" does not follow a conventual 3 act narrative structure. All the events in the movie happen in order but the focus of the movie is on characters just living their lives. The story takes place during a hot week in a Brooklyn Neighborhood. As temperatures run high, patience wears thin. The movie doesn't focus on a central conflict or have any real villain. It just focuses on neighborhood people having conversations. They talk about sports, music and other people in the neighborhood.What the film does well is how it presents its theme. There is a running motif throughout the movie about the philosophy of violence. There are two quotes highlighting the differing doctrines of Malcom X and Martin Luther King Jr. The movie presents this question to the audience of when is violence the answer? And the movie does not give an answer to that question, they leave that up to the audience to interpret for themselves. The movie doesn't paint one side as the villain, there is fault to be had on all sides. Because of this, the movie never feels preachy. It just feels like it is telling us how it is, and then poses the question to the audience of: how do we make it better?I think what the movie says and how it says it is very well done. I just don't care for the characters and story all that much. The characters are always yelling at each other and complaining. There is a romance story that I feel could have been cut out and I wouldn't have missed a thing. And there is one big element of the ending conflict that seems to come up out of nowhere and kind of derails the whole story.So, I respect the movie for what it is. I like the way they handled their theme. But the story is a bit unfocused, the characters aren't compelling, and the ending make this fall short of this being great for me. Take that for what its worth and see if this is the \"Right Thing\" for you.",

            "content": "Do The Right Thing is a movie that I had heard great acclaim for. For example, Siskel and Ebert both called it the best movie of 1989, and one of the best movies of the 1980s.It's also one of critic James Berardinelli's Top 100 movies. I expected to love it that much myself (I've shared S and E's enthusiasm for movies like Hoop Dreams and Fargo), but it didn't quite hit the mark for me.Don't me wrong, Do The Right Thing is a very good movie, and I'd be happy to see it again. In fact, I think I need to in order to fully embrace it. I just don't feel the full hype- at least upon first viewing.The plot takes place in a 24 hour period, in which it's the hottest day of the year in Brooklyn, in a thug part of town. Much of the film revolves around a pizzeria- the workers and the customers, and a conflict that leads to a violent riot.There is much talent in the film, especially from Spike Lee. Not only does Lee play the main character, but he produced, wrote, and directed the film as well.There are other great performances as well- such as Danny Aiello as Sal, John Turturo as one of his sons, Samuel L. Jackson as a radio DJ (I wish he was in the movie more), and Martin Lawrence as a lisping minor character.There are many moments throughout the movie that explode with greatness. One particular moment is a scene that references one of my top 10 favorite movies- The Night of the Hunter, particularly the words ''love\" and \"hate\" on one's knuckles. In another scene, an old man saves a kid who runs in front of a car while playing.Then there are moments where a customer complains that Sal has a Wall of Fame full of Italians but no black people- when most of his customers are black. Protests start out as playing loud music while demanding 2 slices of pizza and escalate to the final 20 minutes- which is both shocking and powerful.While most of the film is great, there were moments that seemed to just be there. For example, the man who saves the child seems to (beforehand) talk in the film to expand the runtime, and I wasn't sure how this advanced the plot.Mookie, Lee's character, spends much of his work day doing other things than work- and I couldn't help but wonder why Sal, knowing of his diddy-dallying, let him keep working.Finally, while this doesn't always bother me, the profanity was a little bit too much. For example, dialogue sometimes went like this:Mookie: Pino, (beep) you, (beep) your (beeping) pizza, and (beep) Frank Sinatra.Pino: Yeah? Well, (beep) you, and (beep) Michael Jackson.6 F-bombs in 2 sentences seemed like overkill. (Wikipedia reports that there were 240 Fs in 2 hours, averaging to 1 every 30 seconds. It was NOT that frequent though.)I enjoyed movies like Eddie Murphy Raw, Goodfellas, and Casino, and even then I was like \"this is ridiculous.\" Sometimes they said it so much that I had a hard time making out anything but the cursing. Again, I enjoyed the movie, but that was bothersome.Despite some slow moments and the overdone cursing, Do The Right Thing is a powerful and shaking portrayal of racist tension. While I don't completely share the critic's lauding, or most audience members, Do The Right Thing is still a very good movie that I would see again. If you can handle the swearing and tension, seeing this movie is definitely the right thing to do.",

The camera had kind of a red tint to it throughout the movie that I noticed, probably to show how hot it was I'm guessing. The movie takes place in Brooklyn and is about a young African American man named Mookie who works delivering pizzas at the local pizzeria owned by an Italian named Sal. Sal built the pizza shop himself and has been delivering and working in Mookie's neighborhood for a long time, a lot of the residents talk about how they grew up on Sal's food. One day while at the pizzeria, a young African American man confronts Sal about the wall of fame he has in the shop. It was full of white people and he wanted him to put some black people on the wall but Sal responded with \"when you get your own store you can do whatever you want\" and refused to put up anyone else on his wall of fame. The young man tried to get the neighborhood to boycott Sal's pizza but no one agrees to do it at first. Sal's son hates the neighborhood and wants them to movie their business but Sal refused, Sal's son and Mookie argue constantly about race and things like that. One man in the neighborhood, Radio Raheem, carries a radio around with him no matter where he goes and blasts rap music. However, when he went into sals with it blasting he screamed at him to turn it off or he wouldn't serve him. That night radio Raheem returns blasting his radio in the store and refuses to turn it off until Sal changes his wall of fame, so Sal smashed it with a baseball bat. This lead to total chaos, the neighborhood guys started fighting sal and his sons. When the police came, they grabbed radio Raheem off of sal and put him in a chokehold and ending up killing him. This just got the crowd even more fired up. Mookie even throws a trash can through Sal's window and they destroy Sal's pizzeria and set it on fire. The movie ends with Sal paying Mookie for his weeks work and the two having a talk. I felt really bad for Sal and his business being destroyed. I don't think Mookie did the right thing by throwing the trashcan through the window which ultimately lead to the complete destruction of the pizzeria.

            "content": "Spike Lee's vision and extrordinary brilliance for catching the imagination of whatever he was directing is why he is such a great director. The movie who also stars Spike Lee is a tale of a single street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn area of New York City. The movie is about the fight between African-Americans and a all-white own pizza shop that has serviced the community for 25 years. Spike Lee does this to show you the injustices between whites and blacks and how the smallest issues can turn into a riot from simple ignorance and hatred for the color of ones skin. This is shown in the final quotes of the movie which reflects the difference between MLK's Non-violence movement and Malcolm X's Violence is intelligent when in self defense. The Song \"Fight the power\" signifies the fight of the black man in the bedford stuyvesant community while Radio Raheem who is slain by a police officer who chokes him out so much it kills him. Radio Raheem wore a Love and Hate ring on each hand to signify the fight the African-Americans dealt with in a time when people still fought over racial issues. This is all signified in a dramatic scene of events when John Turturro, Spike Lee and others command a large number of racist terms that relate to whites and blacks and even italians which can also be seen in other Spike Lee Joint's like the 25th hour when Ed Norton spits out all the names and reasons he hates the city of new york and everyone around him. There are two things in this movie that really make me think, Would it have killed Sal to put up a black athlete in the store to please his customers and did Mookie save Sal and his son's life by igniting the riot and throwing the garbage can through the store leading the mob to go after the store instead of its owners. The question of What if crosses my mind and will forever live like that in my mind. It makes you wonder if the character Love Daddy played by Samuel Jackson was right in the beginning when he said and pleaded to the audience, \"WAKE UP\" and maybe thats what the neighborhood needed.",

What I was most surprised by with this film is Spike Lee's work on screen. I've known of him as a director but I felt like he really did a great job as Mookie and Samuel L. Jackson adds a little bit of humor to an otherwise very serious movie as the local DJ.

Mooki's character seemed to teeter in the middle of everybody because he was black and everyone feels that he should be supporting his black \"brothers\" but he works for Sal's pizza place who everyone seems to antagonize because he refuses to put any black people on his wall of fame. In the end Mooki sided with everyone else and started the sabotage of Sal's business however everything could have been prevented if there was proper communication and understanding. Everyone thought Sal was being harsh because he claimed that it was his restaurant and he could put whoever he wanted on his wall of fame; which is true because they all so happened to be Italian Americans however everyone took it harshly and offensively. It just goes to show that proper communication is key amongst everyone. I also liked Spike Lee's use of the reddish yellowish lighting that was used throughout the whole film, it was meant to portray the heat and it id very well because throughout the whole movie everyone was complaining about the heat. I also enjoyed the use of different camera angles and the close up shots of the characters.",

This movie was very powerful and gave a look at the racism and tension that was going on in Brooklyn, Ny. It had tension between the piazza shop, the African Americans, and the Whites. It also fit perfectly with what is going on today with the police killing unarmed people. It really made me mad at the end because of all the rioting and destruction that the people did to the piazza place. The cops choked the man to death so they took it out on the piazza shop. It made no sense to me. I also didn't get why Mookie started the riot by throwing the trash can through the glass. I just didn't get it because he seemed like a really good guy. The movie technicality wise was great. The color they used was like a red orange type and it was great. They also did it perfectly showing how hot it was and what the people were going through.

Spike Lee wanted to show in this movie, that race relationships in America are still a problem. Even to this day, this movie still applies and could be made today and it would affect me the same way.In terms of actual technical skill, the movie feels different. Spike lee films in unusual ways, he keeps the camera moving. He keeps it upbeat, he keeps it fresh and he keeps it interesting.The performances are great and if there was one stand-out it would have to be Sal.Overall, a very thought-provoking movie that makes you pondering race relations.

Do the Right Thing is unlike any movie I've seen before but it is extremely powerful and touches on serious topics like racism and the unfair justice system. The fist half of the movie could be considered a comedy and surround a neighborhood during a hot day following around crazy and fun characters. But the second half is more serious and the tensions that we see build up through out the movie burst. It relates back to the heat, the day gets so hot and by the end it starts to boil. One, of many, things that Lee does in his film that really makes it different and catches the attention of its viewers is the racial slur montage. This scene show different characters breaking the fourth wall and looking straight at the camera while rambling off some slurs as if they were insulting a person of a certain race. Mookie starts of with insulting the Italians, then it cuts to one of the pizza brothers insulting black, and so on. This scene really catches the audience of guard not only are they characters listing of slurs but they are breaking the fourth wall and addressing us, as if they are insulting us. Do the Right Thing has a power message and is a strong movie that I believe is a bit underrated, it does some great things that are different with editing that really should get some credit.",

I also found several of Lee's filming techniques to stand out. Throughout the course of the film, the camera is always tinted with a color. While this does not hinder the viewing experience, it allows the viewer to remember that they are watching a film since it somewhat draws you away from the experience. Another aspect of the film which create this distancing effect are flat characters such as the disk jockey and Mother Sister, who are always found in the same location when filmed and add comical value.

The climax especially, with the unfortunate murder of Radio Raheem, goes to show how the racism can intensify to such extreme levels. When this happens, nothing good will ever happen. The soundtrack to this film, highlighted by Fight the Power by Public Enemy, accentuates the racial divide in the neighborhood, especially in a radio showdown between Hispanic men and Radio Raheem.

Spike Lee had a great character study film going until the very end when frankly his racist views bled through and made the apparent heroes of the film unrelatable for me... *********HERE BE SPOILERS*********the guy they painted a the villain Sal was more in the right than the martyr character raheem or the angry mob that burned down the pizzeria... i haver to call bullshit on Raheems death he would have been unconscious at that point not dead... you don't immediately die being strangled you pass out and then you die... they dropped him as soon as he went limp... he would have survived or at least been resuscitated... mookie i still don't understand why he threw the trashcan through the window... if that mob should have been angry at anyone it should have been the cops...

The cinematography (by Lee mainstay Ernest Dickerson) is vivid and mesmerizing, and set a standard for many films that would follow.

Other shots would just be crooked which I thought was a cool thing to do it was almost like it was so hot the cameraman couldn't hold the camera straight.There was also a reddish-orange tint to the movie to have to look like it as really hot.The most important thing is at the end of the film was whether Mookie did the right thing when he threw the garbage can through the window, that started the riot that destroys pizza shop. I believe Mookie did it to saves Sal's life, because it redirecting the crowd's anger away from Sal's person to Sal's property.The question is never answered at the end of the film but only has you thinking more about it by the contradictory quotes: one from Martin Martin Luther King, Jr. advocating non-violence, and the other by Malcolm X advocating violence is self-defense.",

But Spike Lee's undoubted talent gave me the feeling, after remembering the whole film, that he could have given us an even better one: he had the concept, the style, the skills, the crew. It's very good, yes, but there are aspects that I personally didn't find worked that well.The film from the beginning puts you in the atmosphere of a Brooklyn street on a day of unbearable heat. Blacks, Asians, Italians coexist in the neighborhood, and the treatment is that of a light and endearing comedy. People argue a lot, yell, get angry, but it all seems like some kind of game, where nothing is taken too seriously...apparently.The first problem is that obviously that street is a fantasy...because almost no one works there, almost no one wants to work... and almost no one needs to work, because it seems that they have enough money to live peacefully eating pizza, drinking beer and chatting while enjoying the sun, which seem to be the only concerns of its inhabitants. Was that the situation in Brooklyn?Naturally, not all black residents spend the day on the street, or enjoy loitering forever, but the presence of this group, with a single exception, is not even inferred by omission: it simply seems that they do not exist. What we see is that only one Italian family and one Asian family work hard in the neighborhood.The atmosphere of the film is therefore that of a laughing comedy, where the sense of humor is based on a burlesque look that shows characters that are mostly picaresque or infantilized.Spike Lee's greatest ability seemed to me to be how he avoids two great temptations: trying to give importance to the film through the irruption of melodramatism (the scene of the boy about to be run over by the car pointed that way), or to gradually create a gradual increase in clearly evident tension through the introduction of dark or murky elements treated in a dramatic way.But no, everything seems to remain stuck in a status quo of silly tensions, where there is a white police officer who is obviously racist but who nevertheless knows the neighborhood and knows how to deal perfectly with the environment (his behavior in front of the character in the luxury car is closer to the offenders than to the victim); where the Asian family lives happily secluded in their store, avoiding any communication that is not strictly commercial with the people of the neighborhood and concerned only with saving some money; where an Italian is fond of his pizza restaurant that has fed the neighborhood for decades; where arguments between Hispanics and blacks are based on who plays the music louder, where a somewhat stupid black guy tries to boycott the Italian restaurant but all his friends laugh at him; where the pizza delivery man is clever and obviously spends more work time than he should messing around... This comedy atmosphere is not broken even when the white policeman looks with obvious contempt at the lazy trio who spends the day drinking beer... Even the eldest son of the Italian family, the character of John Turturro, the most disagreeable of the movie, is idiotic enough not to be shown as a real threat, much more an object of ridicule than anything else.So the genre is clearly comedy: on the hottest day of the year, if tensions rise, they do so in a comedy atmosphere, as if everything were going to end in a meringue pie battle in the purest slapstick style. .Spike Lee simply injects brief intermissions in which he shows that deep down this is a time bomb: at a certain moment all the characters vent on camera insulting the neighbor.Spike Lee's ability seems to be to me, as I say, in that we didn't quite realize that it was a pressure cooker, and suddenly barbarism is unleashed. A black boy is not allowed to enter the Italian restaurant with the music blaring, and another black boy is irritated with the owner of the Italian restaurant because he does not have pictures of black personalities on the wall, and the two together decide to pay a visit to the restaurant to confront the owner of the pizzeria. It's when they come in...that we're not so sure we're in that comedy mood, and that effect is masterfully created by Spike Lee. And a couple of minutes later there comes the tragically too well known moment.What I didn't like?: Spike Lee sometimes tries to treat certain scenes in a more original way and ends up looking like a crappy parody of the nouvelle vague, some transitions between scenes seem a bit clumsy, and the characters of Mother Sister and Da Mayor are cloying stereotyped...In fact, all black characters have a nickname, and the director does not intend to give them more humanity and complexity than what nicknames give them.Overall, a brilliant film, very important, but one that leaves us with the feeling that it could have been even better, that it had everything to be much better.",

Everybody has someone they hate, and that is what is destroying us.

Spike Lee did a brilliant job showing us the different mentalities in each character, changed by their family life or age or any other factor. The ending isn't satisfying for anyone, because there is still a war to be waged one way or the other. The symbolism of putting up the images of MLK and Malcolm X at the end tell us that we don't know what the answer is, and neither does Spike Lee.

On one of the hottest days of summer temperatures rise on the both in the air and between the different ethnicities shared by the neighborhood. The story revolves around Sal's pizza place, somewhere the entire neighborhood grew up and eating from.Throughout the entire film we are shown every character and a slice of there perspective on the community and the people within it. The audience is able to see different views and perspectives of each race and gender and a small portion of each persons life in the neighborhood. Sal and his two sons run the pizzeria; one son close to the main character Mookie (African American) and open minded to the others in the neighborhood, and the other son who hates the pizzeria and everyone surrounding it.

The film deals with the racial tensions between the different races inside of the city. Our main character Mookie seems to be in the cross hairs of the tension amongst the community members of his block, being cool with whomever he comes in contact with, only really caring about how much money he has in his pocket. Working at Sal's pizza shop he mixes with everyone from the block because everyone has grown up on his pizza. it isn't until the hottest day during a brooklyn summer where the tension between some of the locals and Sal turns violent due to the lack of black history memorabilia on Sal's wall amongst many other things. Is Sal the power that Radio's boom box has been talking bout? This film brings to the surface many stereotypes that've been embedded into our culture not to make a point for any certain person place or thing but as a reminder that these things happen.",

It is a story about racism and different races living closely together in the same neighbourhood. What I love about it though, is it is not force-fed onto you. That and it meshes so well with the comedy that is quite alive in this picture.It is wonderfully filmed and the colours almost seem to bleed out of the screen.

For example, many of the characters are portrayed as both the \"good guys\" and the \"bad guys\" simultaneously; Mookie is the \"babies daddy\" to a girl he hardly sees or genuinely cares for but has times of insight and deep thought, Radio Rahim seems to go about his own business just carrying his boom box yet instigates the fight at the end, Sal seems fair and genuine until we see his affection/intentions for Mookie's sister and then explodes at the end shouting all sorts of profanities, and even the police who sort of brush off the playful incident with the fire hydrant then turn excessively violent during the end scene. There is so much empathy confusion in this film I really couldn't decide who to dislike and who I endeared. There are few \"neutral\" characters who do not stir any feelings of anger and I suppose we identify with them more.In any event, I am still unsure of what to think of this film. I understand Spike Lee's message that senseless, racially charged violence is the product of previous senseless bigotry and closed-mindedness, I am just not sure what to think of how this all played out because, as mentioned before, I tended to both accept and hate many of the characters at different points in the movie. This was the first Spike Lee film I've ever seen, so maybe I'm just not acquainted with his style. Either way the movie was very intriguing because it leaves so much up for discussion in the realm of personal opinion, and that, I think, is the beauty of it. See it!",

The right thing is to grow up and take responsibility for your life. Which Mookie does not do. He doesn't throw the can through the store because he thinks Sal and sons are racist. He throws the can through the window because he realizes that Sal and his sons are in trouble, and instead of being a man and trying to calm down the crowd like da mayor does the easiest way to save them is to turn the violence towards the store.

It's culturally important and cinematically interesting, but when it comes to how one feels after watching it, it's a toss-up with no right answer. Most of the film is funny, but slightly obscure, odd but entertaining, with indications of the underlying meaning. But once that meaning comes out, the entire film changes. This film is about prejudice and unresolved hostility, and by the end speaks loudly and distressingly of the widespread consequences of racial prejudice. Spike Lee takes a risky shot with creating a film featuring conflicting themes of content and choices of cinematography, the prior being unfortunate realism and the latter lacking verisimilitude. And it ends up about as confusing as it sounds. I think intentionally displaying the violence racism caused and is still causing is honorable, but how unrealistic the actual film comes off as is disconcerting and takes away from the overall point, making the truth of it seem exaggerated instead of realistic.I wish I could say \"watch it\" or \"don't watch it\" because I think its reception is different for every viewer, and it's impossible to tell if you'll like it until you see it.

There are many instances of racial tension throughout the movies involving these groups.

We are introduced to one character after another, and after a while watching them sweat and squint in the sun, we begin to feel the heat too. As the film progresses, the people become more and more agitated. Who wouldn't be furious in this kind of heat?Therein lies the genius of Lee's screenplay. The heat wave is racial tension physically manifested. Then the film takes its time building and building until its inevitable climax. By the time this happens, we are too invested to care about who is right and who is wrong. After a second feeling, I understand that only the characters know that. The film isn't about whose behavior is justified, but rather about dealing with racism in a mature and reasonable way.

That scene in the film left my jaw open because I was in shock. Sal and his two sons defiantly played the roles and attitudes of Italian men, but Sal loved working at the pizzeria and he loved feeding the block. At the end when M.

There are neighborhoods like Bed-Stuy all over the country and I grew up in one similar to the one in the movie. Usually a neighborhood will have stores that represent the demographics of the population. What Spike Lee is saying in certain neighborhoods are about money and gentrification. An Italian and Korean store in a black and Latino neighborhood was a crucial plot point in the film because the attitudes combined with the humidity led to the movie's climax. I saw this when i was 13 years old and got the message instantly. I've never questioned Mookie's action of whether he \"did the right thing,\" because I understood the monologue Radio Raheem gave earlier in the movie. The love/hate war Radio Raheem talked about was to me at 13, very clear, because just when you think hate wins, love subsides and overcomes. Right before Mookie threw the trash can threw Sal's window he yells \"hate!\" SPOILER-when he goes to Sal about getting paid finally at the end, they both cautiously become friends again (love). Radio Raheem wasn't a thug, he was just a normal guy in the neighborhood who had the respect for being older and yes, even more mature than the other people on the block. Spike Lee wasn't condemning anyone in this movie but examining norms affecting society in neighborhoods like Bed-Stuy, when combined with heat and the attitudes of a few trouble makers explode. When Sal's burned down, Spike left a hidden message there, do you think Sal rebuilt his place back to Bed-Stuy?? Of course not, but now the property is vacant and open to someone else at a low price for redevelopment (gentrification).

I usually don't like when a director goes a little above his head and experiments with the camera movements and placements, but I liked the way they shot this film.I really had to struggle for a moment in the end to not be mad with Spike for giving the police officers the perfect excuse for what they did, he really is a sneaky, frustrated guy for the way he wrote the mess that happened.Overall, it is a great movie. I haven't seen much of Spike's work because he tends to make films that are politically heavy and I am not a fan of that particular sub-genre, anyway, now I can't wait for Da 5 Bloods.",

Sal is the owner of the pizzeria shop in a Brooklyn neighborhood and Mookie an African American boy works for him. Across the street from the pizzeria a couple from Korea that owns a convenience store. The major characters' name are Mookie, Da Mayor, Radio Raheem, Sal, Pino, Vito, Buggin out, Jade, Mother- Sister, Samuel, and Mister Senior Love Daddy.The theme of the movie is going the right thing. The Mayor stopped Mookie while he was on his way to deliver a pizza and told him to do the right thing. The Mayor saw a boy crossing the street and was going to get hit by a car so Mayor pushed him, so that he didn't get hit by a car.Sal son Pino hated working for his dad in an African American neighborhood. Pino said maybe we should sell this place why we are still ahead in life. Pino also said maybe we should open a pizzeria in our own neighborhood. Sal said that there is a lot of pizzeria already; he has been here 25 years where is he going. Pino says he is sick of \"niggers\"; it's like when he comes to work its like plant of the apes and he don't like being around them animals. Pino also told Vito not to trust Mookie because he will back stab you. This shows the prejudice among the minority themselves.One of Mookie friends name Buggin Out, went to the pizzeria and notice on the wall that there were no pictures of any African Americans on his wall. Buggin Out was trying to get a group of people together to boycott the pizzeria. Radio Raheem agreed to boycott the pizzeria with Buggin Out. Radio Raheem and Buggin Out went to the pizzeria with Radio Rhaeem's radio blaring. Sal didn't like it, so Sal got out his baseball bat and smashed the radio into pieces. Radio Raheem got very mad, so they all started fighting. The NYPD came out to break it up, so they pulled Radio Raheem off of Sal. The NYPD killed Radio Raheem. This started a riot against Sal and the Korean. Mookie then picked up a trash can and threw it at the window of the pizzeria shop. Then the whole neighborhood damaged the place and lights the place on fire. Buggin Out was the one that started the whole thing and I feel is responsible for Radio Raheems dead. Once they did that they turned to the Korean and the Korean said I am the same as you. They left them alone.When Jade went to the pizzeria to eat and Sal was being overly nice to her, Mookie did not like it. So Mookie grab her hand and took her to the side of building and was talking to her. I think that part didn't look natural. It looked reddish and brown, the building even looked fake.This just shows that doing the right thing is appropriate. Make sure you think before you do something. Violence is not the key to everything. I also think that Mookie betrayed the Sal, because he threw the trash can and broke the window. If it wasn't for that, I don't think they would of damage the place.",

The DP Ernest Dickenson makes the heat of the summer sun come to life, and you can almost feel the rays beating down on you watch.In a nut shell, DTRT tells the story of the hottest day of the year in downtown Brooklyn. As we meet the characters, the story unfolds and temperatures rise. Like most of Lee's movies, DTRT is socially concious, takling issues of racism, loyalty and responsibility. Lee also puts together a visual feast, incorporating some brilliant sequences and shots. Lee is definetley the most important director to emerge from the late eighties and early nineties, and continues to be one of the most consistently entertaining auteurs today.

Lee uses humour for a greater effect in order to keep the audience intrigued with this compelling piece of work.The film follows a usual, yet extraordinary day of Mookie the pizza delivery man, living in a predominantly black neighbourhood of Brooklyn New York. The story's core focuses on Sal's famous Pizzeria. A pizza joint wherein Sal's sons face trouble and conflict, mainly due to one of the brother's racism.Spike Lee creates an immaculate vibe which i've seen in very few other movies by immersing the films viewers in and taking them for a ride. From the dazzling dutch camera shots, to the vibrant and vivid cinematography used to bring it's viewers in for a unique experience, each and every actor delivers top notch performances.In a way, the film has something in it for everyone, whether it be the vibe or the issues discussed at hand, it reminded me of a simpler time in my teenage years, hanging around with friends on a hot day, looking for a bite to eat, characters which stand out etc:\nThe title itself 'Do the Right Thing' serves as a motif for the movie itself. It's easy to say it right? But when conflicts arise within groups of different people, emotions can cause turmoil in many different ways, as we can see through Mookie's perspective as the story progresses.Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing is one of the most captivating films i've ever seen, as well as serving as a landmark for it's genre (representation, social class etc:)\nIt still holds up exceptionally well today and presents scenarios as lightheartedly as possible, until when us viewers feel we have had enough, which is demonstrated through Mookie's perspective. Lee has masterfully crafted this movie in a way everyone can enjoy it. A movie you must see before you die.",

I think one of the main reasons I did not like this movie was because it was all about people over reacting where I felt that most people would not act the way the characters in the movie did (but thats why it is a movie I suppose). I was confused at the end, as there was no real solution or portrayal of what the \"right thing\" to do was in the situation and I was glad when the movie ended.

The acting is phenomenal and the eccentric dialogue features colorful language that adds to the tone and mood of the film.

And the scene with Buggin' Out getting his Air Jordan's ran over by a bike rider really stuck with me because I am a huge sneakerhead and felt his pain immediately when I saw that.

            "content": "Spike Lee has shown his ability to produce and important film. The recent Blakkklansman (Rating EIGHT) is an important film and warrants watching.\nThis movie could be unfavourably be compared with the superior Boyz n the Hood (1991) but it predates that movie by two years and it was broader in that it showed the race relations more starkly than any other movie was attempting at the time rather than (just) exploring Black culture in a specific location.\nI would happily say the Spike Lee was still finding his feet in directing this movie. Perhaps leaning on his music video work the opening credits passage is excellent. Rosie Perez is dancing ferociously to \"Fight The Power\" and is powerful and absolutely representative of the times.\nThereafter and particularly in the first half the movie feels like a play that is being filmed. It feels very staged and uses a lot of young talent that is early on its learning curve resulting in some inconsistent acting.\nI'd argue there was a change of camera policy too. The colour palettes are strange and the shots confined so some of the scenes look like they're being performed on a set rather than an actual location in Brooklyn. You'll be convinced of this until an hour in there's a fabulous tracking shot of Spike Lee's character passing by all these places we have visited in the first half. Very odd.\nThe characters are too stereotyped and there's masses of gesticulation. To be fair(?) no community escapes this. The Asian, Latin, African-American and Italian-American are all a sea of what appears (twenty years on) to be ignorance.\nStrangely if we're going to look at things with hindsight the female characters are the ones that are the best written and most credible.\nThe film seems to lack focus and though it has idea about its end goal, it doesn't have much of an idea how to get there. In this respect it mirrors Spike Lee's character (Mookie) who incidentally is totally unbelievable.\nTo conclude, Do the Right Thing is almost twenty years older than Blackkklanman and absolutely remains an important film. It's is flawed but it is humorous at times and though a touch monotonous, the soundtrack is welcome and energetic. The movie ends with a Martin Luther King quote which sheds more light on Spike Lee's motivation. How well he managed to realise this is up for debate. SIX",

He even tries to settle the heat between vito and his brother but at the end of the day he was human, and reacted as a result if hurt and anger towards the death of his much loved friend.

The film is based on a block in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn NY. Within this block there are many different races, each with a different way of life. This particular block is primarily run with African Americans, but the two main businesses weren't. The one a pizza shop run by Italians, the other a corner store run by Koreans. It shows a time in the world when the color of a person mattered more than the actual person. A street block in a city is only so big, so when racial groups mix and tensions grow major tribulations can unfold quickly. One may think that by the 1980's everybody was equal, but racism was still strong. Black pride had become a key part in the growth of our nation, but the struggles during this time were frightening; Violence always seemed to be the answer. As shown, even something as seemingly innocent as music could create such a tension that violence was threatened. Everybody on the block had to make decisions every day. The decisions such as what time you were going to go home. These may not seem like a major dilemma, but sometimes what time you came home may change the rest of your life. Every character on the block, regardless of their age, race, or purpose in life had to make decisions each day. When situations erupted and authorities needed to be called in, it didn't always make things better because the Police officers were forced to make tough decisions too. Police officers were known to the resistance to equality was vast. You walk away from this film analyzing and deciding for yourself whether the characters made the right decisions.

First, though, there were certain elements of the film that I thought were good: 1. I thought that Danny Aiello's performance stood out as extremely good. Of all the characters, he was the one with the most depth, I thought. 2.  Spike Lee has a very strong aesthetic sense.  Visually, the film was very interesting a lot of the time.  I do think that he could have done more with the motif of extreme heat throughout the middle third of the movie.3.  Lee represents ambiguity well in places--for instance, he shows that despite certain racist elements ingrained in him, Sal/Aiello is not a bad person.  Of course, I think he romanticizes the character of Sal in parts.4.  The scenes that did not have any dialogue (I'm especially referring to the riot scene) were very powerful.  Lee builds suspense and interest extremely effectively.Which brings me to my list of complaints.... 1.  I thought Spike Lee's performance was atrocious, often comically bad. I think he should have skipped trying to be a complete auteur for the film and let someone more qualified play his role.  The final scene with Danny Aiello is one of the best-written scenes in the movie, but Lee nearly ruins it with a wooden reading of his lines. 2.  Much of the dialogue was extremely awkwardly constructed.  Reading his journals, I had extremely high hopes for intelligent screenwriting, but I was really disappointed.  I understand that Lee was trying to make many points about violence and about race, but I thought that he resorted to \"speechifying\" rather than assuming very much intelligence from his audience. By tacking on speeches about race relations, he missed a good opportunity to incorporate them more effectively into conversations.3.  Having Spike Lee's character of Mookie throw the trash can through the window of the pizzeria (by the way, did anyone else find it odd that they spelled it \"pizzaria\"?) was a mistake, I think.  It would have been far more plausible and more satisfying if someone else had commenced the riot. Spike Lee could have gotten his point across much more effectively had his character simply not done anything. 4.  The film seems extremely dated, to the point where something that may have been comical in 1988 is simply not funny, whereas other elements that were not intended to be humorous have become amusing.  This isn't something that I can necessarily fault Lee for, but it was rather distracting as I was watching it. 5.  I just don't think that the writing is intelligent enough to do justice to Spike Lee's very important ideas about the topics addressed in Do the Right Thing.What worries me, however, is that my problems with this film stem from the fact that I, as a white male, might never fully understand Spike Lee's perspective on racial issues.  I want to be as objective as possible in my assessment of the film, but can I escape my own cultural and racial pigeonhole?",

And the great thing is that it did exactly what that presentation I saw in the gym didn't do, it had you look within yourself and ask those questions: \"Do I contribute or do I try and stop it? Or do I just let it slide and keep on living my seemingly undisturbed life?\" I live in a part of New England where these issues don't really affect me, so I really could not say. But then I realized that that was a cop-out, kind of like how one of the three black men on the street corner in Lee's film says how he's tired of the excuse that they don't own a store because they're black. Well I got tired of doing the same thing when it came to racism: it doesn't affect me. Very few films can change one's ways of living, but this one does. Spike Lee's film will always be an extraordinary work of art.

Probably one of his best films, which doesn't get nearly the amount of recognition it deserves, \"Do the Right Thing\" explores a major issue still prevalent in America, and around the world, today. The film also emphasizes the underlying question:\"if you were in this type of situation which road would you choose to take; that of violence or that of explanation?\" In terms of both form and content, \"Do the Right Thing\" is definitely brilliantly made. In terms of style, the physical coloring of the movie is really quite interesting. Using a range of deep reds and oranges, the color of the film really helps cement the idea that 1. it's an extremely hot day, and 2. that there's a brewing anger inside all of the characters. The cinematography as well, is pretty cool. There are a lot of interesting angles and perspectives and overall it is just pretty interesting to watch. Content wise, the story line is just as important as the physical format of the film. The acting is realistic, and the characters are portrayed in a way that is both believable and emotional. Focusing on a single neighborhood in New York City, Spike Lee takes a variety of different races and shows how they act with one another in terms of bigotry, racism, and the possibility of acceptance. This film is important because it not only points out the sad reality of racial injustice in America but it also provides a realistic representation of how people deal with such injustice. The ability to deal with injustice in a nonviolent way is important, but knowing when that isn't enough and knowing when the right time to use violence as a means of retaliation is just as, if not more, important than the pacifist perspective.",

My favourite scene? Easy: \"Hey, don't be f***in with the water - this car's an antique\".....When the car and driver get soaked he responds to the NYPD's invitation to file a compliant with \"Yeah, I wanna file a complaint, I want them buried UNDER the jail\".I particularly liked the character \"Sweet Dick Willie\".

The dancing and music were very interesting, but I didn't understand the significance of it in regards to the film. The characters did a very good job with their parts and I thought that the music was also good. It was also different, but not in a negative way, how the film was based on only one day. Spike Lee was able to make a 120 minute movie out of one day's activities. The ending of the movie was saddening and left me with a bad feeling.

The Boom box guy's speech about Love vs. Hate was somewhat motivational, but also rather odd, in some ways at least.

But that's what makes it a classic. I saw this movie on the FX and Bravo channel. Mookie, a black guy, is a guy who works at Sal's Pizzeria, an Italian store. Mookie has a go-nowhere job as a pizza delivery boy. Pino and Vito are his sons. Pino is the older, racist son. He seems pretty decent at first----pretty-------but then his racism develops as the time goes on, but then on the other hand,all his favorite persons are black. I believe Mookie when he says he wishes he was black. Mookie: \"Who's your favorite athlete?\" Pino: \"Magic Johnson.\" Mookie: \"Favorite actor?\" Pino: \"Eddie Murphy.\" Mookie: \"Your hair is kinkier than mine. And you know what they say about dark Italians. You wish you were black.\" Coincidence. I think not. I think people who love/hate blacks wish they were black themselves. Especially if everyone they admire is black, and set their hair to look black themselves. Vito is the decent, younger son. His face is hideous but he's a pretty nice guy. He's friends with Mookie and everything. Sal---he's very mysterious. I mean, it appears that he's decent since he considers Mookie his son, but then the way he talks to Buggin' Out (Mookie's friend) is inacceptable. Buggin' Out: \"Why don't you put some brothas up on that wall!\" Says he when he sees there are only Italians up on Sal's \"Wall of Fame\" Sal: \"Hey, when you have your own store, you can put up all the brothers, sisters, neices, and nephews you want. But this is my store.\"As the movie goes on, people become less tolerant. Sal seems to get more bitter towards black men by the day, but when Mookie sister Jade, a black woman, comes in the store. He goes blank as if he's been flashed by a ray. He falls for her like a sack of bricks, and Mookie dosen't like it one bit. \"Stay away from my sister,\" he says. Story lines good: Actings good: Except for Spike Lee, for he, like in Jungle Fever, says words out of his mouth but he has no expression. Everyone else did great. Especially John Turturo and Danny Aielo. Go see it. Buy it at a store or look for in in the Bravo or FX channel. That's what I did. And I can't wait to see it again!",

Having watched the film again, I cant understand why anyone would recommend this movie to a child\u0085but I will get into that later. The film is very representative of the time in my opinion, the dancing, the music, the clothes. The music really added to the film i must point that out, songs with lyrics telling to fight the power. I like how throughout almost the entire movie its got this hand-held camera kind of feel, the way the movie is shot makes you really feel as if you are right there on the street with the movies characters. There are also some very interesting camera shots in this movie. For example the scene where Radio Raheem goes into Sal's. We as the viewer see a point of view shot from Sal of Raheem, but this shot also painted Raheem in a more intimidating light,at least to me. I didn't care for the ending of the movie, I found it somewhat unrealistic. To think that someone starts the destruction of your business, and the next day you can friendly with them, just doesn't seem to realistic to me. I normally don't like movies that take place over a course of a day such a short time period, but in this particular movie it helped to hold my attention. Obviously the social message of the film is to do the right thing, but what is the right thing? I liked how it seems like the decision of what the right thing was, was left up to the viewer. I think that open interpretation is what Spike Lee was going for. I also find it very neat that Spike Lee wrote, directed and starred in it. It was also fun to see a younger Martin Lawrence and Samuel L Jackson. Overall I think it's a classic cultural movie that everyone should see, but its nothing special if that makes any sense.",

The film uses a variety of characters and plot points that can be seen as devices or metaphors for unquestionably wrong aspects of society. The heat wave that the neighborhood experiences is means of describing the building tensions between the minority and underpowered members of the society and those who are in power or are not of a minority. Radio Raheem is character that is often seen carrying a radio that loudly blasts Public Enemy performing their music about \"Fighting the Power\" which enhances the idea of the common people of the neighborhood fighting against Sal's Pizza. Radio Raheem also tells the story of love and hate which is comparable to racial acceptance and equality to some extent. Much of the movie consists of relatable struggles and ultimately the characters appear very human. The variety of characters act as representations of different members of a society ranging from those who work, those in power, and those who fight for change but essentially do nothing for a community itself. The movie makes use of social commentary touching upon things such as police brutality, \"deadbeat\" parents, and family owned businesses. The tensions that eventually explode into a riot in a horrible, but comedic manner, show the harsher and destructive aspects of a society that is prone to hate and misunderstanding. \"Do the Right Thing\" is a film with many notable lessons and themes that make the movie a quality viewing experience.

I was surprised by some of the other actors (I hadn't recognized who they were by their names in the opening credits), but I thought that it wasn't too shabby. And then, there was the ending. Or, in reality, the scene before the actual ending scenes. I knew that Spike Lee made important movies, and that he was into topics that were prevalent with African-Americans at the time, but, it was very rough to watch. I've never liked violence, I've never liked fights, I've never liked confrontations, and I've never liked extremely loud music and noise; all of which this movie contained. The worst two parts of all though, that actually scared me (the second actually sending a shiver down my spine) was the police brutality right after they broke up the main fist fight, and the part where \"Smiley\" was walking and sort of humming along to \"Fight The Power\" in the midst of the fire and destruction of the pizza place, and calmly attaches the picture of MLKJ and Malcolm X on the wall, next to all of the other pictures, of which caused one of the main conflicts in the first place.

But I do believe Spike Lee used this movie to show a white man acting nice to black people but resorting to attacking them in the end. I myself grew up in a black neighborhood in the early 90's and I was picked on all the time for being the little white girl, I was even jumped a few times just for being a little lighter in skin tone. This movie irritated me because some of the characters tried to play the victim for no reason at all, which is the reasoning for the major conflict at the end, and of course I don't agree with what the jerk cop did. I believe Spike Lee had a lot of power as a black director and many black people probably looked up to him. Although someone might have been ignorant enough to believe that what the black kids did at the end was justifiable and it's okay to act like a complete savage. It's not okay for the cop to kill the kid, but it's also not okay for some kids to go into a store acting like baboons just because there weren't certain pictures on the wall.

            "content": "I don't feel like I have the right to comment on whether or not DTRT is racially fair and balanced or whether or not presents a realistic portrait of the black experience in Bed Stuy like a lot of reviewers do. I'm white and don't live there. The best thing about this movie for me is the strikingly original visual stylization. It seems like it uses colored lights or color filters in outdoor scenes, which is something I've never seen in a movie, or at least never seen done to this extreme, with no regard for replicating realistic outdoor light. As for the film's social/political point of view, it certainly seems from the script he's written that Spike Lee is arrogant, racially biased, even anti-white, but so what? I wish moviegoers these days would realize that movies don't have to be a blueprint for living one's life properly and decently, with characters that treat each other fairly and considerately and are an inspiration to the younger generation. Movies are entertainment, and, whether you like it or not, bad behavior is, generally, at least as entertaining as good behavior. All the characters in a movie can be complete *ssholes and it can still be a great movie. Even the so-called heroes of this film are seriously flawed. Mookie (Spike Lee) is a negligent father and boyfriend who only cares about working and getting paid. Even Spike himself has said that the character of Buggin Out (Giancarlo Esposito) was wrong in believing that Sal (Danny Aiello) has an obligation to have photos of black people on the pizzeria wall just because the customers are nearly all black. I agree that if Buggin had his own business, he could put up who he wants. The real racial injustice is the trouble he'd have starting the business in the first place, things like not being able to get a loan because he's poor and black. People have said that in the scene in which everyone is yelling racial slurs into the camera is anti-Semitic because after the Korean has shouted anti-Jewish slurs the scene ends and the Jews don't get to retaliate. To that, let me offer this point of view: THE SCENE HAS TO END SOMEWHERE! The way the scene is structured, with each character on screen disparaging a new ethnic group. it either has to go on forever or somebody has to be left out. True, Spike wouldn't have ended the scene with Pino (John Turturro) saying the anti-black slurs, but that doesn't mean the scene is necessarily anti-Semitic. i think the plot of getting photographs of black people on the pizzeria wall is weak, unimaginative and too literal. And Spike is a terrible actor, but probably does his best acting in this film. The retarded character Smiley (Roger Guenveur Smith) is too expensively and stylishly dressed. Being so-called disabled and selling photographs for a buck or two on the street, he probably couldn't afford those clothes. Tina's (Rosie Perez's) incessant nagging of Mookie seems like a movie clich\u00e9: the unsupportive, overbearing, haranguing girlfriend/wife. Da Mayor's (Ossie Davis's) unreciprocated romantic pursuit of a hostile and unmoved Mother Sister (Ruby Dee) is also a familiar movie clich\u00e9, largely unmotivated and too cutesy for this semi-realistic movie. The scene in which Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) buys the batteries from the Koreans (\"D, motherf*cker, D!\") is a masterpiece of character-driven comedy. I like the way the store-owner (Steve Park) is on the edge of exploding verbally, even goading him, pretending he thought he asked for C batteries instead of D. I think Bill Nunn is the best actor in the DTRT, with a natural and seemingly effortless characterization of an overbearing and obnoxious but also deep-thinking and intelligent young man. The riot in front of the pizzeria with the cops choking Raheem to death is intense, violent, well-done and believable. The theme of this film will never get out-of-date, since police brutallty, racially-motivated and otherwise, will never stop. The scene in which the voice of DJ Senor Love Daddy (Samuel L. Jackson) is just listing famous black musicians is superficial and insubstantial, as if just dropping their names is going to infuse the film with the impact listening their music gives. I've seen that trend in a lot of movies lately: just mentioning the names of actors the writer likes or the names of songs, TV shows or movies the writer thinks are cool. It's lazy writing. This film is actually, to me, less about racial hatred than how extreme physical discomfort (in this case, from extreme hot weather) can either bring out feelings we represses or turns us into something we're not. Sal, I think, is too up-front with his intolerance and prejudice. His character would probably try to mask his feelings with humor and condescending false attempts to ingratiate himself with the black customers. This is a very biased, unbalanced, but entertaining and powerful film. Of course I don't know this for a fact, but I think Spike possibly has a lot of hostility toward whites that's possibly well-founded and that is definitely a great deal of the impetus of this script, but no one in this film does exactly \"the right thing\". There are no role models, but that's often how life is. Like most controversies, the issue of black and white isn't all black and white.",

I love how Spike Lee is the director and also uses himself as the main character. I think Lee is hilarious and made the movie 10x better by being the main character. The music was awesome, and the camera angles were amazing. I loved the dutch angle shot when the music man with his boom box goes into the pizzeria. I also liked watching this film because we have a lot of riots and racism going on in the world today, so it brought up various points to me about \"doing the right thing\".",

It holds up very well, although I now consider it a very good rather than a great movie, as I did the first time.\nSpike Lee's movies are always political/issue-oriented in their tone, but in most of his films after this one, the characters tend to speechify and debate as if they were panelists on \"Nightline.\" This remains the film in which Lee most artfully blends issues into the narrative mix. And boy do we get a cornucopia of inner-city issues: racism (of course),police brutality, absentee fathers, gentrification, and even a taste of that \"jungle fever\" to which Lee would eventually devote an entire film. All of this comes to light on a summer day of blazing temperatures and tempers on a racially diverse street in Brooklyn. The film climaxes in a series of questionable split-second actions and reactions to the mounting tensions of the day. The ultimate point of the movie is to challenge the viewer to evaluate these actions not only from the viewer's own perspective, but from the perspective of the characters involved. Mission accomplished. Lee succeeds in portraying the values, priorities, and prejudices of a whole community through glimpses at their lives in a single day.\nThe controversy that met the film upon its release focused on what happens in the movie, as if by portraying certain actions, Lee was advocating the same. This is a very short-sighted view that ignores the first 9/10 of the movie in which we see the flaws of everyone concerned, and thus should realize that anything they ultimately do must be weighed in light of what we know about them. What was really revolutionary about this film is that for the first time, racism and other serious issues that blacks face were not addressed in the past with blacks mostly quiet and obedient in the background with whites as their champions/saviors like \"Glory,\" or \"Mississippi Burning\" or in the present with white protagonists like \"Colors.\" This time, the time and setting was here and now and black people were upfront and spoke for themselves. It's no wonder some feathers were ruffled. But many years later, most viewers should be able to see through the fog of these concerns and appreciate a very well-constructed, tense, and entertaining drama.",

From the opening music by Public Enemy, to the call for us all to `Do  the right thing'.When one looks at a film like this, with so many characters, you feel just as with Tennessee Williams play the main character is the heat. It controls everyone's actions. Like a thermometer when the heat is to much, something is going to blow and when it dose you know someone will die. The cast is just a joy to watch. It's good to see old timers (I mean that with the most respect) like real life husband and wife Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee, up against the wonderful John Turturro. Danny Aiello has never been better and Rosie Perez has never been more sexier.This is a film for every race, and like Spike Lee's Malcolm X, we all have to say I am black, I am white and I will `Do the right thing'",

Spike Lee does such a good job presenting this theme that everyone no matter of race, sex, or creed can fully empathize and connect with the characters in this movie. Everyone can feel the tension and understand the problems. Everyone can almost feel the heat acting as a catalyst.

            "content": "\"Do the Right Thing\", produced by and starring Spike Lee, is a movie that questions the viewers notion of what the right thing really is. In the film we meet Mookie (Lee) a young pizza delivery man who lives with his sister Jade (Joie Lee). Mookie lives in a predominantly African-American neighborhood with two exceptions - A market owned by a Korean-American family and the pizza shop he works for, Sal's, owned by an Italian-American family.\nThe movie pits all races against each other. Sal (who owns the pizza shop) has a wall inside his store dedicated to famous Italian-Americans. This angers one of the residents of the neighborhood (Buggin' Out) who asks that Sal put up some famous African-American, to which Sal refuses, which upsets Buggin' Out. Other residents choose to look down on the Korean market owners for not selling the preferred beers of the area or just treat the owners poorly for being different. Sal's son Pino dislikes African-Americans and the whole neighborhood and is less than thrilled to be working at a store serving them. It seems that each race has it's own reasons to dislike the other and that no one gets along.\nDespite it all, friendships form. Mookie befriends Vito, Sal's other son, who is not racist like his brother. Sal is close to Jade, Mookie's brother. And yet, with all the tension between everyone else and the record-breaking heat, tensions reach an all time high. Lee brings the hatred closeup, literally, using close-up shots of actors insulting different races. This closeup style shot is used throughout the movie, occasionally at angles to emphasize characters and the powers they do (or do not) posses (such as depicting them from a low angle to make them tower or a high angle to make them small).\nEventually the movie comes to it's peak. Buggin' Out enters the pizza shop with friends who demand Sal add African-Americans to his wall. Buggin' Out's friend Radio, aptly called so for his love of his boombox (which is constantly blasting Public Enemy) is part of the gang protesting and Sal asks Radio to turn his radio down, to which Radio refuses. Sal smashes the radio, Radio begins choking Sal, and the police are called which ultimately results in police brutality as the police kill Radio. As the police disperse, Mookie takes a trashcan to Sal's shop's window, resulting in most of the neighborhood rioting and destroying the pizzeria. The neighborhood then focuses on destroying the Korean mart but ultimately changes their mind at the last minute.\nThe next day we are left viewing the aftermath of the now destroyed pizza shop. Mookie asks Sal for the rest of his check which Sal initially denies but then caves and pays and both come to some sort of apology. The film closes with two powerful statements from two prominent African-American figures, Martin Luther King Jr and Malcom X. King's statement speaks strongly of resisting the urge to be violent and rise above it while Malcom X expresses the need for violence to get things done, then closes with a picture of the two men together.\nSignificant to the time it's produced, what this movie ultimately explores is police brutality and the unfair treatment of minorities by the police. This is referenced in the films credit as the dedications are made to black people who experienced death at the hands of police in the years right before the release of the film. What is the right thing, the movie asks. Should Sal have put pictures up in his shop? Should Buggin' Out have let it go? Should Mookie not have thrown a trashcan? Is violence always wrong, or is it sometimes a necessity? This is a film that will stay with you for a long time, leaving you to figure out the answer to the question. 10/10",

I've seen other movies by Spike Lee and very much liked them........Jungle Fever, Malcolm X and School Daze. For some reason I never saw \"Do the Right Thing\" even though it was his most famous. Well, we went to see it this week at our local city art museum, which we are members of. A lady first gave her beliefs about the themes of the film, listing a series of attacks against Black people...the fact that one of them was the proved racist fraud of the Tawana Glenda Brawley fake rape case and the lady belonged to \"Black Lives Matter\" was a warning that this might be about race baiting. The movie is two extremes; on the one hand, it's an incredible masterpiece of directing, screen writing and acting, a nearly perfectly made film as far as filmmaking itself was concerned. On the other hand, it was a film that could be quite hypocritical film with some enabling of racist viewpoints and one or two approvals of violent solutions. The climatic scene, a violent and terrible race riot, gave an eerie version of the Michael Brown event many years before it happened. A anti-violence quote by MLK came at the end, immediately followed by a pro-violence quote from Malcolm X, from when he was young and had views he later denounced. This was a truly controversial movie, with parts I loved and hated, but of highest quality. I have recently edited my original review, which had very negative comments, after reconsidering. I didn't like my review so redid it. One can only criticize so much to a masterpiece of film making.",

            "content": "***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Spike Lee presents an excellent character study of the racial tensions which constantly simmer and explode into the New York City headlines on an all too regular basis. He presents us with a cast of characters which represent all of the most common stereotypes. It is up to us to look beneath that facade and see the characters as more than just two-dimensional. Each has flaws, but we need to look at how they interact with each other to get the full measure of each. The Mayor (Ossie Davis) could be dismissed as a useless drunk. We see in his actions he has a heroic nature, and speaks with respect to those who respect him. Radio Raheem, seemingly overflowing with anger, has a friendly demeanor with his friends, Bugging Out and Mookie. Even Mookie, who some describe as lazy, takes time out of his workday for a shower, not a beer.The real message of Do The Right Thing is delivered by Radio Raheem himself, explaining the rings on his fingers to Mookie (Right Hand= LOVE, Left Hand> HATE). He describes Hate as gaining a temporary lead, only to be conquered in the end by Love. This message is underscored by the final quotes delivered by Martin Luther King Jr and Malcolm X. MLK describes that Hate does not solve the problem but only leads to further escalation of violence and hatred. Malcolm X tells us we cannot stand by when others are destroying us....self-defense is not violence, just common sense.Leading up to the climactic explosion of riotous violence, Bugging Out and Radio Raheem are at Sal's Pizzeria looking for some measure of respect. Radio carries his respect with him, in the form of a thunderous boom box, which Sal beats down when Radio refuses to lower the volume. Radio grabs Sal in pure rage, and ends up in a fatal choke hold when he refuses to submit to the will of the police who restrain him. As Radio's body is hustled away from a dangerous scene, it is then that Mookie smashes Sal's Pizzeria with the trigger word: \"Hate!\" Here we see another meaning to Do The Right Thing....that the correct response was now Hate, expressed not against people, but against property.In the final scene, Mookie approaches Sal demanding his money. Although they exchange heated words, Mookie parts with Sal as if nothing has happened. In his ending, Spike tells us that Love again triumphs, and the Hate of the prior day is vanquished. We are soothed by Dr. Love, broadcasting the theme whenever the violence and hatred threaten to consume the community. And life goes on, without any neat endings and quick fixes, just the sense that we all should Do The Right Thing, based on the circumstances of the day.",

            "content": "Spike Lee's film \"Do The Right Thing\" evokes many emotions from the audience viewing it. However, audiences who have different backgrounds may perceive the movie in a different fashion. Spike Lee accomplishes this by using different film techniques to get across a message. This message, however, will be received differently depending on the audience because of racial and cultural footholds that have been nailed into American society. The two primary races this movie was geared for was African Americans and Caucasians. These two races may see the movie differently due to the way Spike Lee produced the movie. White's may see the movie differently because most of them come from alternate backgrounds than the one depicted in the film. The characters behavior may seem odd to Caucasians. This is because Spike Lee is good at creating characters. They are created in a way that makes them almost over the top. The black characters especially are depicted in this way. Radio Raheem, the Martin Lawrence character, and Buggin Out are all examples of these bigger than life characters. The characters become very recognizable throughout the film. \"Do the Right Thing\" had almost 20 characters with large roles and the audience was able to recognize all of them within a 2-hour runtime. Creating the characters in this way makes the interactions between them very interesting because of this clash of different personalities. The final scene right before the radio is smashed in the pizza shop is a great example of this battle of personalities. Because of the way the characters are constructed the white audience may root for the white characters in the film. Perhaps they can recognize better with the white characters, which seemed to be less toned than the black characters. The white characters were written in a way that almost makes them sympathetic. The younger brother, who is always getting bossed around, definitely reinforces this belief. The pizza owner sees the black characters as his children in a metaphorical sense because he watched them grow up. He is a likable character, even though he has some racial issues of his own which are revealed in his encounter with Radio Raheem. Even the older brother is sympathetic despite the fact that he is probably the most racist character in the movie. Although, the audience does get a sense that he is just confused. This becomes apparent in the scene with him and Mookie when they are discussing his favorite people, who are all African American.This isn't to say that all the sympathetic characters are white. Da Mayor may be a drunken bum but he is depicted in a way that shows he is good at heart and throughout the film he becomes the most sympathetic character. The interaction he has with the punks, when they are making fun of him makes you identify with him. He risks his life twice saving a young boy and during the violent climax he pushes the pizza shop workers to the side so they won't get attacked.The other side of the coin is the way the black audience perceives the film. They may see the movie differently from the white audience because they can identify and affiliate themselves with the lifestyle of the characters in the film. The film raises racial issues that African American audience will easily recognize. Issues such as police brutality, which was depicted in the violent climax where the police murdered Radio Raheem. Another racial issue that the movie touched upon is the failure of white people to recognize the change in the culture. The Sal character refusing to put pictures of famous black people on his store wall and the condescending white male in his car are both good examples of this issue.Spike Lee seemed to employ different creative techniques to make sure different audiences saw a different film. He requires the audience to think for themselves and decide what to take from the movie. Lee doesn't take any sides. The characters juxtapose each other very well. None of them seem to be 100 percent in the right. He raises tension with his characters over the top personalities and other techniques. He colors the film with a certain yellowish hue. Obviously one of the reasons for this was to make the day seem hot, as it is one of the hottest days of the year. However, the coloring doesn't change at all throughout the day to show that time is progressing. Perhaps this is alluding to the constant state of racial tension between the races until night finally falls on the neighborhood and violence breaks out. During this scene the Mookie character, who seems neither over the top or sympathetic seems to take a side and breaks the pizza shops window. It is unclear why he does this. Was he upset over the death of his friend, Radio Raheem? Perhaps he was trying to save Sal and his family by averting the mob to destroy the store instead of the family. Perhaps the two audiences see different endings, which was probably Spike Lee's intention when creating the film.",

That said, on to the rest of the picture.Set on the warmest day of the summer in New York City, the heat comes alive on the screen. The colours are penetrating, vibrant and extremely diverse. The story however unfolds itself quite slow; you meet everyone in the neighbourhood and their seemingly meaningless daily activities. Main character Mookie, portrayed by the director Spike Lee himself is an ordinary guy, delivers pizza's and is very likeable, like every black person you meet. Even the white owner of the pizza parlour, played by Danny Ailello, has his place in the black community. He has been there selling pizza slices for a long time seen many of the kids grow up on his pizza, and has a friendly relation with most of his customers. His sons however, hate the place and would rather be somewhere else. Especially John Turturro who plays Pino \"detests this place like a sickness\". As the day progresses and we learn more about all these people, we see that everyone isn't as good as we thought they were. Mookie is a bad father, the old guys in the street seem to do nothing then bicker over complete nonsense and a group of black kids hassle a white guy over a pair of sneakers which are apparently smeared. Lee becomes completely self referential and shows that black people sometimes do the things that make them stereotyped by white people. However, all the characters remain very human, real and sympathetic. And as we wait for the explanation for why Lee chooses to show \"his\" people in this fashion, it comes with a bang. The night falls, tensions rise. Inside the pizza parlour a fight starts over the music played by Radio Raheem on his radio. Aiello, who protected black people for the length of the film now snaps under the pressure of the growing mob in his restaurant and smashes the radio. And all comes down to a racial fight. Hate for some one else colour killed a black man. The Korean store owner on the other side of the road fences of the raging mob by stating he is black as well. This whole sequence rained down on me like a big bag of bricks. It's a portrail of underlying hate, ever-growing tension and an incompetence to really get along with each other. It doesn't provide any answers to racial matters, nor does it try to explain them. It's an honest story about the real way many people think about each other. And I believe was just an eye opener for many people, and remains as such. There is more to come.",

If you do, you will get something bad in your life. Furthermore, if we consider the sound of the movie, this movie is dominant because there are many sounds in the movie. In the dancing scene in the beginning, the sound of music is off-screen sound(nondiagetic) because the dancing has the same pattern with the song. In addition, there are many off-screen sounds that are from the radio in many scenes. Besides, for nondiagetic sound, there are two types; first, the director uses instrument to make the sound background such as Jazz; second, the director uses music that has the singing to be the sound background. In the scene of the argument, the quantity of sound are high pitch, high frequency, and very high loudness. Finally, in the scene that two men has own radios has the mixing sound between the sound of the radios and the sound of Jazz instrument.",

Spike Lee certainly does not overestimate the power of film saying \"no films going to change things overnight\" however he uses various film techniques, (mise en scene) clever cinematography, and amazingly convincing performances of the American under class as a vehicle to bring into focus very serious racial and economic issues.The Hollywood film delivers a disturbing political message, and is an Obvious \"wake up call\" to society.

The visuals are very pleasing, certain scenes that are filmed on the street and in the pizza shop give you a true feeling of actually being there. Also the sound in the movie does well to create a deeper sense of reality. The screeching tires, early hip hop music, and noises of the city all are masterfully edited into the film to enhance the verisimilitude. I think that social message being portrayed is very eye opening and does well to create a sense of awareness. The acting is also very good. You get to tag along side of the different characters and witness on a first hand experience what problems they face on a daily basis as far as racism goes. You get to see the hatred between the African American community and the Italians,which awakens you to social issues that currently plague our society. The movie also does a good job in pulling you into the storyline. You can easily be immersed in the storyline and follow the struggles of the different characters.",

It appeared to have low lighting, it always has this very interesting warm tone to it almost like a yellow or an orange tone. The camera angles and perspectives, switched often to show everything that was going on. For example the water hydrant scene where it starts off above, then goes below and then there is also a shot where it is through the water. They have a great use of color in this movie, especially the scene where the men are talking by the red/ orange brick wall. They have one scene where it starts off as a close shot of the lips, but slowly gets larger showing the background, I like that different perspective that they used.",

Another film that touches this topic is Mathieu Kassovitz's 'La Haine', which is essential viewing in a political, but also a visually stunning sense. The storyline of Do The Right Thing is quite simple and straight forward; it follows the life of one particular individual named Mookie (Spike Lee) as he drifts through the day like any other before. He works as a delivery boy at the local Pizzeria under Sal and his fierce disdain of one of Sal's sons Pino, who is played superbly by John Turturro, creates an emphasis on the racial tension. In a sense this film does not truly take off until its demise due to all of the racial hatred being contained - in order to gather momentum - and when it finally does arrive it is an explosion of guilt and bitter anger that escalates racism to the peak of its deadly potential. The film works to great effect with the vivid surroundings of a true New York City neighbourhood; the nostalgic feeling to it allows us to venture onto the streets so we can breathe, smell and taste the tension through the scorching heat. With the film opening to the line 'Wake up' (quoted by Samuel L Jackson) we are already shown implications of Spike Lee's intentions. This film is seriously persuasive in its aim to make us think more about the problems in society in America and globally, and the fine script, direction and much of the acting is courtesy of Spike Lee, whom is in his finest hour. Please see this film to appreciate its unique qualities that are all so simplistic and obvious, yet still stand unchanged.",

            "content": "\"Do the Right Thing\" is a film from 1989 directed and written by Spike Lee who also stars in the movie. The rest of the cast includes Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Richard Edson, Giancarlo Esposito, Bill Nunn, and John Turturro.The story takes place in the city of New York City, New York in the area of Brooklyn within the neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant. It is on one of the hottest days in the summer. The story follows the adventures of a young African-American man named Mookie who lives with his sister and works as a delivery man for a middle-aged American-Italian man named Sal who owns the local pizza parlor, \"Sal's Famous Pizzeria.\" Mookie's heart is not into his job at all, and doesn't take it very seriously and often slacks off from it much to Sal's dislike. Mookie also has a three-year old son with his girlfriend Tina, but is too scared to marry her, move in together, and settle down.\"Sal's Famous Pizzeria\" has been standing proudly in the neighborhood for twenty-five years. Sal, and his two sons Pino and Vito are few of the only white men who work in the area which is predominantly African-American. The neighborhood was originally a largely Italian-American neighborhood until the 1960's during the civil rights movement when black people moved into the neighborhood, which caused many of the local Italians to move out.Sal's oldest son Pino, is a huge racist and hates having to work in a black neighborhood. Pino makes it very clear that he doesn't enjoy his job and that he hates black people. Sal's other son, Vito is more open toward blacks and just the opposite of Pino, and has a good friendship with Mookie.One of Sal's regular customers, \"Buggin' Out\" notices that Sal's wall of fame in the restaurant only has pictures of Italians. He asks Sal why there are no black people on the wall, and Sal tells them that this is his place, and Italian people are to be all the wall only. Buggin' Out argues that because mostly black people spend their money in there that they do have some say over the creative control of the business. This idea does not go over too well with Sal, and he kicks Buggin' Out to the streets. Buggin' Out then plans to organize a boycott of Sal's pizzeria and goes on a quest to find those who will join him. There are other little story lines and characters within the film, but the one I described above is the main plot of the story.It's an interesting, thought provoking film that I think everyone should see. It's a little disturbing and not a feel good movie. It's also just a tiny bit dated (but the 80's theme is all apart of the appeal in my view) the film is kinda cheesy in some parts too, but again, it is apart of the appeal of the movie. There's also some reverse racism that goes on that is intended to be comical to black audiences, but I found it to be offensive and mean.On that note, in many of Spike Lee's movies he often has his Italian characters as either being racist bullies that the audience are suppose to hate, or unintelligent people who the audience is suppose to laugh at, and we see both of that in the characters of Pino and Vito.There are honestly no classic cinema good guys in this film. (which is not exactly a bad thing since it makes the film more realistic.) Not even the main character Mookie is someone I would call a hero. He doesn't set a very good example for the audience. He's a complete slacker when it comes to his job, and only cares about getting paid, and yet he doesn't do much to earn the money.Spike Lee presents a very realistic and honest look at culture clashes that sadly exist in the United States of America. Now while it's true that I personally haven't been involved with too many race conflicts, thank goodness...all one has to do is observe history, read a newspaper or watch the news to see the realism in \"Do the Right Thing\" that is just as alive now that it was in 1989.The thing about this film is that almost no one is nice. Almost everyone is a very rude jerk with no manners. Some might think this movie stereotypes New Yorkers, but there were mostly New York actors in it. I can see why NYC has the rep that it does (at least among some of the people I know) for it's rudeness, and this movie does not deny it. In most cases, anytime a person is rude to another person, that person will often react by also being ruder, and that happens often in this film, and so much violence and drama could have been avoided in this picture if one person could have turned the other cheek, swallowed their pride, been polite and unselfish. I think the movie is very realistically because in real life, the exact same thing I said above applies to everyday violent human events.The title \"Do the Right Thing\" is interesting...because no one does the right thing.",

Many of those groups under-went protests over the films heated racial over-tones.And yet, if the film were to be released in the summer of 1999, those same feelings would be at the forefront of most topical discussions.  The world has changed very little from 1989.So goes the underlying point to Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing\".  A film that, if you ask me, is meant to show that there is no way that different races and cultures can ever be one without realizing the differences between them.  This isn't the bad thing.  The evil thing is saying half-heartedly that we're 'all one big happy family'.  We are not.  Not yet.The performances in this film, though sometimes over the top, often are right down to earth, and the real truth that permeates everyday inner thoughts.  Though here, they're displayed in brilliant dialogue by Lee.The look of the picture is key, highly inspired by the great cinematographers like Haskell Wexler (who's 1969 film \"Medium Cool\" bears alot of the same tones that Lee's film brings to the screen).  Ernest Dickerson's shots of vivid color as the hot day in New York wears on, put you right on the block and make you see the raging truth underneath this tightly rapped package.\"Do the Right Thing\" is one of the best films of the 1980's.",

Mookie(along with Pino of course), is the most racist person in the film. Sal, his boss tolerates all of his jerking off at work(let's face it, he would have been fired in a second anywhere else) and he rewards him by inciting the riot that eventually ruins Sal...seeing this, one would have to ask this question: did Mookie throw the garbage through that window because he felt discriminated against, or because he simply did not feel like getting up to work the morning after??",

The heat really changes people and make people angry, irritated, and because of this people are much more likely to snap. In my opinion Mookie did not do the right thing by throwing the garbage can at the pizza shop. The lesson in this movie was that violence is not the answer. The ended showed touching quotes from Malcolm X and Martin Luther King stating that violence will not achieve anything.

Being forced to write an essay on it for a class, i've done a lot of research on it, and the more i read about it the more i appreciate and respect the movie. While the basis of the movie is racism, i find the it's not so much ABOUT blatant racism, but about the small cracks in the community can spread apart and shatter it. There is no real 'good' or 'bad' characters here, each side from an issue is meant to be shown. The confrontation between Sal, Radio and Buggin-out, is filled with 'he shoulda' and 'what-ifs'. Radio shoulda turned his music down. Sal shoulda asked him nicely to do it. and what if Buggin-out had asked nicely and gotten a photo of a black man on Sal's wall of fame? Sal was mildly racist towards certain black people, but Buggin-Out was no less so in throwing Italian slurs at Sal. Then there's the Latino gang, the Asian couple running the supermarket, the cops, the Greek chorus-esquire trio of old guy sitting on the sidewalk..... Numerous different points of view are shown, each with their own racist ideas, either small or large. The issue in this movie is not what character is right or wrong. they all have faults, as they are acting out of their own bigotry. Tension from small situations builds up until Radio and Buggin-out burst into the pizzaria, and continues with Sal and Radio in a brawl. Radio ends up being killed by the police, and the crowd is ready to blame Sal, but for what? He was in the brawl with Radio but did not kill him. When the crowd is ready to turn on Sal, Mookie steps in and throws a trashcan through Sal's window, inviting the pizzaria to be trashed. When Mookie throws that trashcan, he has good reason to. It gives a distraction from Sal and his sons. Instead of physically harming them, Mookie invites them to take out their anger on something other than flesh and blood. You cannot argue that a building is more important than a person. As well, Mookie states the next day that the building is covered by insurance, so Sal will get reimbursed for his loss. He knew that when he threw the trashcan, as he was not completely destroying Sal's life, but saving it. throughout the movie there is also an underlying theme of Malcom X and Martin Luthor King Jr, two men with conflicting ideas. Smiley, the mentally handicapped guy, runs around with the only picture of Malcom X and Martin Luthor King together. At the end, there is also two contradicting quotes from the two men about violence. in the end, the movie is less about racism, and more about how 'an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind.'",

I think what Lee is telling us is that none of the people here is really BAD, some of them are annoying, or stupid, or even racist, but nobody is really insufferable. Even the policemen that killed Radio Raheem are not shown as evil tools of the power; they are people in a long and tiring workday, just at the end of their shift a lousy problem is dumped on them, and they screw up awfully.\nYou see tension mounting and people becoming more nervous as the day goes on, so the incidents at the end are the more logical way things could go, they are more sad than enraging, but my impression is that these people didn't act out of hate; they are living a hard life, so they are ready to act out at the mildest excuse, maybe the hellish heat is the main immediate reason of their irritation, but they could live together if they could just stay cool, and think none of their neighbors is the reason of their problems.A final note for my Italian fellows: this film makes me think about the Genoa riots at the G8 meeting last year; they happened at the end of July, in a heat very similar to the one of DTRT.

            "content": "Do the Right Thing is a really good movie. \u00a0Spike Lee, the director of this film; as well as the lead actor, \u00a0displays a rich filmmaking style in his depiction of a racial riot occurring in an Italian pizzeria in a black neighborhood in New York City. \u00a0The riot starts when Mookie throws the trash can out the window and causes pandemonium which alerts the neighbors. \u00a0On reflection of Mookie throwing the trash can out in the street, Spike Lee introduced us this clich\u00e9 so he could provide a good introduction to the plot of the film.Where did this slippery slope on racial hatred begin? \u00a0Well, we can totally blame the clich\u00e9 that started it all... The trash can being thrown out in the streets.. And as I mentioned before, it caused so much pandemonium for the residents in the neighborhood. \u00a0As suspicion was growing among the residents, the blacks came to a realization about racial hatred and the residents take back all the devastating things they've previously done.The message Lee conveys to the audience in this film is that this film is wise about racial hatred and how the characters help each other out and fix each other's problems to avoid repeating their previous mistakes. \u00a0This film also has a fresh way of structuring a narrative by bringing in elements that make this film an actual film. \u00a0Pizza, ice cubes being rubbed on, music being blasted out loud on a boombox, and pictures on a wall all pertain to the plot of the film and what the characters are experiencing in New York City on a hot summer day. \u00a0Buggin' Out eats at Sal's Pizzeria frequently; and Sal gets annoyed while he sees him constantly. \u00a0Buggin' Out also questions Sal about why there are no Italian people on the wall, despite it being an Italian restaurant. \u00a0This leads to the two of them having an argument and Sal threatening Buggin' Out with a baseball bat; kicking him out of the restaurant. \u00a0Sal is also annoyed by the fact that Radio Raheem pretty much does nothing but walk around, blasting out Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power\". \u00a0Mookie throwing the garbage can out the window, Radio Raheem blasting out music on his boom box and Buggin' Out constantly eating at Sal's, as well as his problem with the pictures being displayed in Sal's restaurant; prove that nobody in the film does the right thing that lead to an explosion at the end. \u00a0Why do they do it? \u00a0Because they can't stand the heat on a hot summer day and are exhibiting their reactions. \u00a0They have also felt hatred and Spike Lee is conveying to us how blacks and whites had different rights. \u00a0So yes, the film can sorta be a political satire if you analyze deeply enough. \u00a0This movie is supposed to be about unity; and how blacks deserve to be treated with respect.",

            "review_title": "What is the Right Thing?",
            "content": "My initial response to this film was somewhat mixed as I was perplexed with Spike Lee's intentions in the film. I was somewhat confused as to whether Spike Lee was trying to portray \"the right thing\" as anarchy, rebellion, frustration and disrespect due to the film's catastrophic finale as well as the many conflicts before. Throughout the film, there is also many questionable motives for characters that, as a viewer, I couldn't help but disagree with, from petty yet aggressive arguments in ethnic-owned convenient stores to buy batteries, to a scene where middle aged African Americans have racist discussions on the street corner. Morals and ethics in the film are somewhat blurry and ambiguous. But that's clearly the intention. On repeated viewings, I found the film to be asking the rhetorical questions of \"what is the right thing to do?\" and \"what would you do in these situations?\" This perspective for the film made it much more accessible and effective with its multi-layered narrative. There are many scenes where the viewer may disagree with the intentions of the characters, or may simply not. The film's protagonist - and for the majority of the film, its middle-man - Mookie (played naturally by the film's director, Spike Lee), tries to bridge the gap between tension in many of the scenes, from the local pizzeria's owner's eldest son's abusive relationship with his younger brother to the volatile relationship between the pizzeria owner, Sal (a fantastic performance from Danny Aiello, ranging from endearing to aggressive) and a customer who requests for more photographs of black people on the walls of the business.The film is based on the hottest day on Brooklyn streets as many of the locals take the time to enjoy themselves on such a scorching Summer's day, with the main focus on Mookie, an intelligent yet somewhat slack pizza deliverer for the local pizzeria. Many scenarios in the film portray conflicting perspectives of the locals in the area and in the middle of much of it is Mookie or acquaintances of his. These characters are written as independent thinkers as each one is doing \"the right thing,\" or at least their definition of it, which may conflict with another's definition of it. The film therefore encapsulates the subjectivity of morals - what is right and what is wrong, exactly?It's a fascinatingly told narrative that's full of late 80s/early 90s quirks, boom-bap hip-hop and funky editing and acting. The cinematography is ambitious, somewhat extravagant at times for its use of crane shots to tilted framing, but it works to deliver a somewhat hectic portrayal of a somewhat hectic day. Spike Lee shows his effortless ability to direct and write such an exciting yet complex story in this late 80s black-cinema classic. I would recommend it highly and I would also recommend re-watching it frequently. Watching this with others would also invite debate over the film's representation of morality. It's definitely a powerful piece of cinema and will leave you contemplating what exactly you watched and whether it was \"the right thing.\"",

            "review_title": "Do The Right Thing- 9/10",
            "content": "A completely compelling study of racism in culture diversity in the modern world, Do the Right Thing is a fantastic film, one that delivers universal messages about acceptance, pride, and culture. This is the first movie I've ever seen by Spike Lee, though I've heard this one is his best. I wouldn't be surprised; very few films are this high in quality. The story is relatively simple; it chronicles the course of an entire day in a Brooklyn neighborhood and the growing tensions between the various cultures within. Racist tensions from Sal, the owner of a pizzeria, and many of the various black locals gradually increase before erupting in a shocking riot towards the end that involves great tragedy. Despite the basic story, it's the little things that make the story so powerful. The remarkable thing accomplished by Lee is his examination of the various locals in the city. Throughout the story, we meet several various characters, including Mookie the pizza boy (played by Lee himself), Smiley the mentally disabled man with a passion for what he does, and Da Mayor, the local drunkard with a heart of gold. Every one of these unique characters gets their chance to shine. Most memorable, however, is Radio Raheem, a young black man who displays his happiness by carrying a boom box around with him, cranked up at full volume and blasting \"Fight the Power\" by Public Enemy. He truly embodies much of the movie in a nutshell; he is unable to get along with those different towards him as they wish him to abandon his cultural identity. He takes great pride in his reputation, so much so that he's willing to fight for it, and he ultimately ends up a tragic victim of circumstance. Even more remarkable is the ambiguity Lee takes when making his final points. The film ends extremely powerfully with two quotes. One, by Martin Luther King Jr., condemns all forms of violence, while the other, written by Malcolm X, claims that violence can be justified if it is self- defense. Lee wisely leaves these contrasting statements up for debate; the audience is clearly intended to determine their perception of \"the right thing\". This is an extremely powerful movie, one that I suspect will stick with me for a long time to come. It feels real, and like all the best movies, this sense of realism helps to provoke great thought and interpretation about the culture clash. Overall Rating: 9/10- \"Seriously Guys, Watch This Movie.\"",

I definitaly think Mookie saved Sal by throwing the trash can into the pizzaria. If he didnt, violence would have been brought to Sal and even Da Mayor for protecting him. But it still makes me crazy about the rioting at the end...i know Radio died and people were p***ed, but, all that rioting and freaking out? I mean Sal fed those people, he was a nice guy, people grew up on his pizza, he wasnt a stranger. Radio was going to kill Sal.

This is one of those rare movies that can change someones outlook on life.",

            "review_title": "My review of Spike Lee's, \"Do The Right Thing\", after viewing for the first time",
            "content": "Films directed by Spike Lee consistently include the black community experiencing racial tension, political issues, and poverty in an urban environment. Spike Lee's 1989 work, Do The Right Thing, rightly follows this pattern. The movie utilizes the time frame of one complete day in order to illustrate the constant, repetitive struggle for balance that minorities experience between fighting for equality and harmonizing with society. The opening scene of Rosie Perez dancing in an alley and dressed in boxing gear to the song \"Fight The Power\" by Public Enemy indicates that the movie has a particular focus upon the oppression of people of color via authority. Local radio DJ, Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy, announces that morning that the color of the day is black because it absorbs so much heat. This statement is indicative of the intense fire that blacks are subject to from American society, as well as revealing that blacks would be the focus of the film. In the first scene including Sal's pizzeria, Pino refers to Mookie as an \"azupep\", translated from Italian as meaning \"eggplant\". This word was used as a racial slur in Italy towards Sicilians because they had a darker, deeper skin complexion. Ironically, Vito himself is a dark-skinned Italian. This scene illustrates the sheer stupidity of exhibiting racism in America. Even when two people's ancestries differ from the country they reside in, it is common for one to demean and ridicule the other's heritage. There are many instances of this phenomena throughout the movie when Rosie (Latino), Da Mayar (black), and Sonny (Korean) all fire racial slurs towards one another. However, the Korean store owner, Sonny, recognizes this just in time for his store to be spared from the mob. He exclaims to the crowd, \"I no white! I black! You, me, same!\". This line illustrates that in actuality, minorities in America share the same struggles and have more similarities than differences. In the film, characters Mookie and Vito are written similarly. They both try to avoid confrontation in general, Mookie with his outspoken girlfriend and Vito with his aggressive brother, Pino. In addition, both men avoid the pressure of only having same-race relations, Mookie by having a Latino girlfriend and Vito by having a strong friendship with Mookie. Both men also show their self-control by initially refusing to participate in a riot with such personal aspects, Vito's connection being his father's building and Mookie's connection being fellow people of color in an uprising. Though nearly every character exhibits racism at one point, they also have loving relationships outside of that aspect. Though the police officers unjustly kill Radio Raheem, they still do, in fact, make a sacrifice every day by committing to their dangerous profession. Sal passionately elaborates that he built the family pizzeria with his bare hands and hopes to give it to his sons one day. It's also implied that Sal has romantic feelings for Mookie's black sister. Even prejudice and bitter Sonny is seen running the store with his wife, who he presumably loves very much. Piecing these elements together illustrates that though the characters are racist, racism is a complex element that does not encompass and define a person's entire being. There are many elements in the film that directly clash the principles of violence and non-violence. It is first seen towards the beginning of the film, when Smiley is selling pictures of Martin Luther King Junior and Malcom X, one Civil Rights leader opposed to violence and one unopposed to violence. The principles clash again in personalities as Mookie consistently tries to keep the peace and Buggin' Out is outwardly confrontational, as his name suggests. The opposition is blatantly seen as the brass \"LOVE\" and \"HATE\" rings Radio Raheem wears on his right and left knuckles, respectively. Radio Raheem falls dead with his left hand down and his right hand being captured in the shot, illustrating Raheem's previously spoken concept that hate has the ability to die, while love is forever. Following Raheem's death, Buggin' Out proceeds to tell the police officers, \"I'm a black man! You can't kill us all!\". This line reveals a focal point of the film: People of color, together as a unit, are unbreakable.",

            "content": "Do the Right Thing is a drama film written, produced and directed by Spike Lee. This film takes place in a rural neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York in 1989. Do the Right Thing also takes place is the racial era when there was still tension between African Americans and Caucasians. Mookie, the main character, is a young popular neighborhood boy that works as a delivery boy at Sal's Pizzeria. His dream is to make money but working hard isn't his strong point. He is constantly late for work and when he is making deliveries he decides to make extra errands along the way. In Sal's Pizzeria, where Mookie works, there is constantly conflict and arguing about who does what and other little skirmishes. In the long run, Sal's eventually get burned down during a riot due to racial tension. After Sal's is gone, conflict seems to die down and the streets of Brooklyn are calm. A phrase that you constantly here throughout the movie is \"fight the power\". This phrase comes from the popular rap group at the time, Public Enemy. This phrase is rebellious and sends a message to the African American community to fight the injustice thrown at them by the government. A movement that is also frequently present in this film is a fist in the air. This gesture was used by African Americans as a symbol of unity and that unity would mean that together they would be more powerful as a race. In this film a boom box was used to project the phrase throughout the movie. This boom box represents freedom of speech because you can play whatever you want at any time. Playing the music of your choice can't be silenced.This film would meet my standards of good writing because it has a good plot that can be followed. The flow of the movie is smooth and there aren't any parts that seem to be missing or hard to understand. The writing is has emotion to it and it fits all the scenes at the appropriate times. The writing of the movie builds up with this emotion to the point where towards the ending; all of it comes out in during the riot.During the film, the viewer can notice several groups of people that are always together in a scene. One group of people is Sal and his son's Vito and Pino. Usually these three are all together in a scene that takes place in the pizza restaurant. Another group is Radio Raheem and his boom box. They are usually found walking through the streets of Brooklyn sharing music to everyone that is willing to listen- or unwilling. The next group that the viewer is likely to see is Da Mayor and Mother Sister. Both are elderly young and are icons of the neighborhood. Da Mayor is constantly trying to get the affection and approval of Mother Sister but she is constantly playing hard to get. The last group of people frequently seen throughout the film is three men named ML, Coconut Sid and Sweet Dick Willie. These three spend their day sitting on the corner criticizing one another and the world around them.Seeing this small Brooklyn neighborhood struggle with racism exemplifies how bad the rest of the United States was able to handle it also. (Induction) All films are eye openers. Do the Right Thing is my MLK film, therefore it is an eye opener. (Deduction) From this film I learned back then if you looked any different from what you were then you were automatically an enemy.This film was made to emphasize how racism tremendously affected everyone as human. It also shows how it tears us apart as Americans. In addition this film shows the result which is violence.",

From the abusive cops to the pizza's down the street. It focuses on the idea that even in such a small tight community were everyone knows one another there is still racism.I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good comedy with a point. This movie was not only funny it really got its points of view on race and the way of life in the city really is. It helps people like me view what they go through day in and day out.

            "content": "Bright colours, tilted camera angles, and unbridled racism are things that come to mind when thinking of \"Do the Right Thing\". On an incredibly hot day in Brooklyn, racial tension runs high and reaches boiling point. Mookie (Spike Lee) is a pizza delivery-boy for Sal's Famous Pizza. Sal (Danny Aiello) is reasonable and wants to coexist with his African American customers. He has two sons, the racist Pino (John Turturro) and the respectful by weak-willed Vito (Richard Edson). The pizzeria is a gathering place. Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) calls for a boycott of Sal's after noting that there were no pictures of African Americans on the wall among the Italian American icons. Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) carries a boom box that plays the same Public Enemy song over and over. Both men get kicked out of Sal's due to anger caused by the heat. This along with impatient racism toward Korean fruit-stand owners and rich White people passing through cause a riot at Sal's that results in Radio Raheem's death from a very blunt depiction of police brutality on- screen. A brief stand off occurs in front of Sals's. Many young African Americans blame Sal for Raheem's death. Mookie, a young African American who works for Sal, makes the decision to do the right thing and throw a garbage can through the window of Sal's. People go through the window, destroy the restaurant, and burn it to the ground. Many white viewers wonder if Mookie did the right thing. I say he did. He did it to protect Sal and his sons from being killed. This is a great film of the '80's. It's an important film to watch, but it's not for the faint hearted. The surprising racism is important to see. The police brutality is something every viewer should see. You hear about it happening in America today. But, it's not until this film that you see how casually it is carried out. Essential viewing (15 and up).",

This was looked at a no-no from radio-raheem when he told a white guy that stepped on his fresh jays,saying ( while would you buy a brownstone in the hood).Implying that the hood is sort of a place reserved for minorities, like black people and Spanish, and not for the whites who moved in, he was also mad about the guy stepping on his fresh pair of jays which he was trying to stretch that argument to a fight , that never happened.",

Mookie was my favorite character, he honestly reminds me of me, a huge procrastinator and easily distracted. I didn't like that radio Raheem died in the in when he didn't have to, but this emphasized the racial tension and caused a separated community to come together. It made Mookie realize how bad things were and stand up to his boss. Though I love Rosie Perez, her screeching in this movie is nauseating. Overall it's a great movie with a lesson. Sonny states this, \"We are the same\". He's right, we are all the same and nothing is different.We have to come together and not fight each other. I think this is powerful. A beautiful movie.",

The film is about the struggle to find work, keep work, and do work. Da Mayor and Mother Sister are my favorite characters in the film as they add some sturdiness and gravity to the situation. They are well developed characters who I both wish had had more screen time. The three losers, ML, Coconut Sid, and Sweet Willie were the black man version of Greek chorus and added some humor to the film. The material was very deep and much darker than it was portrayed.

No one is completely right. No one is completely wrong, and they are all full of contradictions. Each action ultimately has a consequence.Too many people criticize the movie for being ambiguous: that was the point. The movie is full of ethical questions about race and violence that don't have right answers. It's the Malcolm vs. Martin debate all over again.

Do the Right Thing seems ambiguous at best to the casual critic, and at worst, a seemingly authoritative and friendly nod towards violence. Yet, after brushing the soot and dust from the surface, and sorting through the rubble, it is apparent that Spike Lee has masterfully composed a poetic prose of pertinent queries and obligingly challenges the audience to ask, \"What is the right thing?\" At the end of the film, when the credits are rolling, the race between love and hate is at a dead heat and it is then that each viewer will decide.The whole story unfolds on the hottest day of the year. The rising thermometers are only eclipsed by the rising tensions that ensue after Buggin' Out, a black youth, questions Sal, the white owner of Sal's Famous Pizzeria, why there are no pictures of black celebrities on Sal's \"Wall of Fame.\" Together with Radio Raheem, the two stage a boycott of Sal's, enraging the longtime businessman. Tensions are fueled even further by Sal's son, Pino, who is openly racist and admits that he \"detests the place like a sickness.\" Throw into the mix police brutality, domestic and financial difficulties, and a boom box set to a seemingly endless loop of Public Enemy's \"Fight the Power,\" and you have a five star recipe for disaster. Themes of love and hate continue to collide as temperatures and tensions continue to rise. Finally, the two bursting emotions meld together and erupt amidst a chaotic backlash of destruction that leaves Radio Raheem dead, Sal's Pizzeria destroyed, and an entire neighborhood altered indefinitely.So, what were Spike Lee's intentions? If he was trying to say something, why didn't he just come out and say it? In a 1989 article by Jay Carr, Lee confronts the criticisms that he was unwilling to feed audiences the answers as to what the right thing is. \"I think anyone expecting Spike Lee to give answers to that is gong to be disappointed. My job is to put the spotlight on race relations in this country. Hopefully, it will provoke thought and discussion. Hopefully, we can move in the direction of ending all this madness.\" Lee's intentionally open ended conclusion engages the audiences infinitely more than if they had merely been force-fed all the answers. It forces each and every viewer to look deep within his or her consciousness and take a stand for one side or the other. Some say that this method is a provocation of violence because it ends on such a violent and hate filled note. Those that say that fail to realize that violence is almost completely negated in the environs of thought and contemplation, and that is the end that justifies the means.The themes of love and hate, while obvious throughout the entire film, are most notably under the spotlight in a unique dialog between Radio Raheem and Mookie, the film's protagonist, played by Spike Lee. During this sequence, Raheem is wearing a pair of brass knuckles on each hand, one spelling out the word \"love,\" the other spelling out \"hate.\" Raheem seems to address the audience, while speaking philosophically about the difference between love and hate. \"One hand is always fighting the other,\" he says. Such is the case in \"Do the Right Thing\".Love and hate are deeply enrooted in the sinews of each and every character's actions. As Radio Raheem put it, \"\u0085 they lead straight to the soul of man.\" Essentially, Radio Raheem is stating that the love/hate dichotomy is the driving force of all human beings. They influence decisions and shape the outcomes. After Radio Raheem is brutally murdered by the police, Mookie's soul erupts in hate and pilots his choice to throw the garbage can through the window of Sal's Famous Pizzeria. Mookie even exclaims \"hate\" in a verbal acknowledgment to the philosophies Radio Raheem divulged. What did Mookie's choice lead to? All is apparent in the neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant the next morning. The streets are littered with debris and voided of many of the familiar characters that would once roam. Socially though, it can be inferred that nothing has changed. All is as it once was, for all that is left is the echoing broadcast of Se\u00f1or Love Daddy and his words of love. It echoes because his words bring us back to scene one. Dead heat.\"Do the Right Thing\" is a relentless roller coaster ride that provokes society to seek out evolutionary progression in the way one human treats another. Emotions ride up and down and race toward what looks like a victory for hate. Quite conversely, however, Spike Lee offers up a dead heat as a means to a conclusion, thus sparking the neurons that lay dormant in so many people. Lee sought to awaken awareness as opposed to providing an audience with answers. The avid and watchful critic will see, undoubtedly, a film that has changed the views of a nation. On the other hand, those that see otherwise are actually those that this film should be most poignant to, as they are gazing into a shattered mirror. Wake up!",

The movie point is to show how other groups look at other groups differently. The movie really show's you how it was to live back in 80's and a lot has changed since then.

            "content": "I decided to watch this movie after an English teacher of mine touted it as the greatest film ever made. I was somewhat skeptical upon hearing this, but that night I rented and watched it. Do the Right Thing is set in a primarily African-American area of New York City during the hottest day of the year, and is centered around an Italian-owned pizzeria. The first thing I noticed about the film was that it was absolutely brimming with the essence of the late '80s. The colors were bright, the music was relatively corny, and the costumes were strangely elaborate. I'm not a huge fan of the late '80s culture, but somehow the film was able to combine these features into a very watchable form. I was able to watch the entire movie without interruption (which is a pretty remarkable feat for me). As the story unfolded, I found myself becoming more and more frustrated. I believe that this frustration may have been intended by Spike Lee, but it somewhat diminished my enjoyment overall. Everyone in the film was so angry all the time, with the exception of Danny Aiello's character for the most part. I found myself repeatedly at my boiling point of rage when I saw how much ignorance was portrayed in the film. It seemed that much of the movie was sympathetic towards racism, as many of the situations that would rouse sympathy for African Americans were caused by their own ignorant actions. Most notably, the actions of Giancarlo Esposito's character struck me as extremely inflammatory. This film taught me one important lesson, however: Ignorance leads only to more ignorance. I was glad when, at the end, the text shown alluded to that idea. Before then, I was somewhat disappointed with the film, really. I felt like it was a movie that merely hated the white man, which wouldn't really appeal to a middle-class white kid like myself. Overall, though, I thought that this movie was pretty great, and for all my gripes, the story came together very well and exceeded the sum of its parts. 8/10",

Race is not something Lee is afraid to confront. As a leading black film maker perhaps he feels obligated to make the film that so many others dare not to touch. The story really makes you think and question some of the ideals of the world. Like what is right and what is wrong and what makes something right even if it seems wrong.

            "content": "The 1989 film Do the Right Thing directed by Spike Lee, is by far one of the first films that showed both spectrums of the racist card that is still played in America today. The main characters in this film are; \"Mookie\", who is played by Spike Lee himself,\" Da Mayor\", who is played by Ossie Davis, \"Mother Sister, who is played by Ruby Dee, \"Radio Raheem\", who us played by Bill Dunn, \"Jade\" (Mookie's sister) who is played by Joie Lee, \"\" Smiley\", who is played by Roger Guenveur Smith ,\"Buggin Out\" who is played by Giancarlo Esposito, and \"Sal\", who is played by Danny Aiello. In summary the film is about how a very hot day turned bad in one Brooklyn neighborhood. The neighborhood which is usually mild mannered, is turned all the way up in a matter of hours because of the heat. Little things that would usually get a pass, have no bars on this hot and hazy day and tempers are flaring! In this film the theme was about how one moment, one decision could change your life in a matter of seconds. I believe that the heat played a major role in the theme because I know from experience that hot weather tends to get people more rowed up when it comes to dealing with other people and different situations at hand. This film uncovers and depicts racial problems that others dare to touch. In the 2004 movie Crash race and prejudices are also showed all across the boards of different ethnicities. The one thing that I admire about both films is that either one of them is one tracked minded. They share all standpoints and are not biased. The film Crash does seem to have a little more grip on the necks of the African American actors and actresses, but it is all for the sake of film and sad, but true reality of the life that some African American's live.A lot of motif's and up close angles were used in this film such as the picture that \"Smiley\" kept carrying around throughout the film. The now famous picture was that of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. in company of each other shaking hands. The whole reason why the neighborhood went out of whack is because \"Bugged Out\" was upset that\" Sal\" didn't have any pictures of African American's in his store, although he served an all black community. In the last scene of the film, Smiley the mentally disabled man walks into the store while it is ignited in fire and puts the picture of the two civil rights activists on to Sal's wall of fame filled with Italian American's. Another motif in this film was \"Radio Raheems\" radio. It was loud and it always played the same song! That song is the same song that started the fight in the restaurant and ended up being the reason why Radio Raheem was brutally murdered by the police. The camera angles that Spike Lee used were a lot of personal and close up shots. It enabled the viewer to familiarize themselves with the characters. It made you feel as if you were there in the film! This film was one of a kind and very much appropriate for its time. Race has always been an issue in the United States and I believe that it takes a bold director to unmask it. The thing that gets me is that all races involved in this film are minorities! Every ethnicity depicted in this film is frowned or looked down upon by someone else! Every believes that their struggle was and still is the greatest and instead of coming together to fight prejudices they fuel the flame to keep it going just to prove their point. This film is amazing and vibrant in laughs, but also shows us the seriousness of things and how our thoughts leads to decisions and our decisions lead to our actions and our actions sometimes lead to our fate or destiny.",

            "content": "\"Do the Right Thing\" is an intense, eye-opening experience that delivers a strong message about race relations in a vividly powerful way. While the movie definitely has a dated look at times, its message is still relevant today. Spike Lee, who wrote, directed and acted in the movie, did an outstanding job of depicting a movie of this nature. I've seen several films with racial themes such as A Time to Kill, but this is by far one of the best, if not the best. For me, the conclusion with the Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X quotes solidifies this movie as a masterpiece. The movie is set in in a predominately African-American neighborhood in Brooklyn during a scorching hot summer. There are different races of people represented, and they know their place within the community. The only two businesses in the neighborhood are a Korean grocery store and Sal's Famous Pizzeria which is owned by Italians. Mookie, played by Spike Lee, works as the pizza delivery guy for Sal and seems to be generally unaffected by the racial tension that some of the other characters create. His primary motivation is simply to make money. One character, Buggin' Out, takes issue with the fact that Sal's Famous Pizzeria doesn't have pictures of \"brothas\" on the wall along with all the white celebrities because blacks are the main patrons. For this reason he decides he wants to boycott the pizzeria. Sal, who's Italian, appears to know and be content with where his business is located and doesn't mind his surroundings. Of his two sons, Pino is the one who hates where the business is located and despises the people in the community. Another character, Radio Raheem, is very conscious of the racial injustices in the community, and uses his radio to send a message through one particular song, \"Fight the Power.\" On one hand you have people like Sal, Da Mayor and others who stand for peace and civility, and on the other you have people like Buggin' Out and Radio Raheem who want to take justice and equality by force. There is an underlying racial tension that escalates to a fever pitch when the latter two decide to bombard Sal's pizzeria, triggering a riot that ends in deadly violence. The motifs used in the movie really brought home the point of how divided the community really was. For example, there was a sequence of characters in the movie spouting off racially charged jargon about each other's race. I dare not repeat any of it. The lighting in the movie was bright, which created very vivid colors and helped to portray the scorching hot summer. This was useful in intensifying the tension in the movie. Ultimately, Do the Right Thing's theme speaks to acknowledging racial injustices and inequalities, but reacting in a civilized manner to create an understanding on both sides that will bring about peace.",

I feel that the theme of \"Do the Right Thing\" is that everyone has a valid point of view of how they view life, but there are not many who are willing to compromise to do the right thing, as Da Mayor(Ossie Davis) was trying to teach Mookie. I feel that the movie has a theme song as well \"Fight the Power\" (Public Enemy), due to the song being played several times throughout the movie.The cinematography had extreme angles and vivid color scheme perfectly contribute to the feeling of heat. At the start of the movie the angles, sound effects, and music gave me the feel that I was there hot on set.

The movie is centered around Sal's Famous Pizzeria, which is the only white owned business in the neighborhood, and one of three business that dominate the block in the movie. The other two are a store front radio station, where narratives from disc jockey Mister Senor Love Daddy(Samuel L. Jackson), and a convenience store owned by a Korean Couple. There Pizzeria owners Sal(Danny Arello) his two sons Vito(Richard Edson), and Pino(John Turturro), and Mookie(Spike Lee) the black delivery guy. The movie began with everyone in the neighborhood going about their usual daily routines, but as the day went on the temperature was not the only thing that began to rise.Tensions began to rise when Buggin Out(Giancarlo Esposito) made issue with the fact that Sal's Famous Pizzeria doesn't have pictures of \"brothas\" on the wall along with all the white celebrities, because he feels that blacks are the main patrons for Sal's. Buggin Out decided to boycott Sal's Pizzeria.

The film is told through the use of multiple characters that inhabit a one-block section in New York's Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood. This is a case study of people who are forced to live together and the ways that they interact with each other. This \"hood\" is made up primarily of such un-stereotypical African American characters that in any other setting might not be believable. There is \"The Mayor\", the local drunk and unofficial eyes and ears of the neighborhood. He interacts with \"Sister Mama\", a crotchety old busy body of a woman that judges her world from her kitchen window. Also found on the block is \"the three men on the corner\" who think they know all and are more then willing to share their views with everyone who passes. The stuttering \"Smiley\" who spends his time selling post cards. \"Radio Raheme, a local tough who spends his time wandering the hood with his boom box and playing the same song over and over. There are numerous others that add to the mix of personalities on this street. The star of the film, Mookie (which is played by the director Spike Lee), a young, directionless man who works in the local pizzeria, which is owned by a white Italian man and his two sons. It is this white owned business in a predominantly black neighborhood that is at the center of this story.I liked this film in spite of the ending that I felt was designed to do nothing more then evoke controversy. This film, despite the ending, is just a slice of life tail about a neighborhood and the people who inhabit it. Spike Lee tries to make a statement about race relations and prejudice by inserting a riot in the end. Not only does this seem terribly out of place, but also unnecessary to the story. I felt that referencing Dr. Marten Luther King and Malcolm X in the end of the film was only a shallow justification to the addition of the riot scene. Maybe Spike Lee felt that he would not be taken seriously by making a nice, lighthearted comedy on his second time out directing. By adding this violent end he transformed a pleasant, fun film into a controversial \"statement\". This may not be the \"politically correct\" way of seeing the film but that's how I saw it.",

Also, at some points music answers some questions that are related to the movie and music carries the coming messages of the movie. Moreover,the hip hop style music that is used in the film involves many talking and words 'when music merge with lyrics music acquires more concrete content because words, of course, have specific references'. These conversations in the music has a reason since hip hop music is emerged to tell the problems and rebellions of African American citizens. If we remember that Spike Lee is an African American it is not so surprising that he used hip hop music to give his message since he was grown in this tradition and get used to it.As we observed generally the music in the opening credits of this movie give us many clues about in what kind of an atmosphere the movie will be on. Also, without knowing about the director of the movie, one can understand from the music and the dancing lady the movie will be in a ghetto,like Harlem, where African American citizens inhabited. The structure of the movie become visible since the beginning of it. Spike Lee continued to use this effect of the music in the following of the movie, too, in reflecting the collectively lived feelings. For example, when these black people opening the plug and trying to be warm they seem to be very happy and during this scene we hear the rage music that reflects the same emotions of joy. This scene with the effect of music it can be concluded that these people wants to be relaxed. Also, the lyrics of this music- you can't stand the heat- reflects the atmosphere as being hot with giving the feeling of beyond endurance of this hot. Also as we understand from the song and the subtexts, those people have the idea that white people do not care for them and they thought that they abondened them to this life. These thoughts push them to fight with the Sal that reflects whites who bothered from this high volume music.Another important effect of the music can be witnessed in the building of characters of people with the help of specific songs that are repeated with relation to a character. As an example of this, we can give the Radio Raheem's song of Fight to Power and the disco music that the kids on the stairs listen. This two example give us their background and this songs and music are the only clues that helps us to categorize these people. The music or the music listened matches people with their ethnicity and way of thought, like salsa for latins and Sinatra for Sal and Italians.",

Although the film seemed to be structured more like a play than a traditional movie, it nevertheless managed to balance many characters and make several points about race without seeming preachy. The best part of about Do the Right Thing is that it manages to point out the problems about racism without making the issue seem simplistic.\nOne of the best choices Spike Lee made was to give Do the Right Thing comedic elements, a style subsequently used by a more recent film about racial tensions in America, Dear White People. The comedic scenes are born out of serious societal discussions, and they both bring the issues to attention while at the same time highlighting how ridiculous racial divisions really are. \nCharacters form the backbone of Do the Right Thing. There are many of them in the space of a single block (hence the \"play-like\" feel), and they each get enough screen time to make the vibe of the neighborhood believable. Some are more memorable than others, and they all are connected in one way or another to the main character Mookie (Spike Lee) and his boss, Sal (Danny Aiello). Although the other performances are strong, it is these two characters who elevate the movie. Mookie and Sal are written and played so that they are completely believable as human beings. Too many movies promoting discussion on race, sexism, and/or homophobia tend to present their characters as either the \"oppressed\" or \"oppressor,\" or they are halfhearted in their attempt to create grey area. Spike Lee does neither of these things, instead showing how ordinary people are affected by racism in this country through small incidents in the movie.\nThe main thing the film accomplishes is that it explains how major incidents over race are rarely as spontaneous as the may seem, and that they are often the culmination of thousands of little tensions that reach a boiling point. Given the current political climate, Do the Right Thing is just as relevant today as it was in 1989.",

The film stars Spike Lee, Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Rosie Perez, John Turturro, and Bill Nunn (Samuel L. Jackson also shines in the role of Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy). Do the Right Thing received an Academy Award nomination for best screenplay, and Danny Aiello was nominated for best actor in a supporting role. The film is widely considered to be a seminal work in examining race relations and racial tensions within the United States, and the consequences of police brutality.The plot of Do the Right Thing takes place over the course of the hottest day of the summer in a predominantly black Brooklyn neighborhood, centering around an Italian-American owned pizza parlor. The audience watches the racial dynamics amongst the neighborhood's various groups - African Americans, Italian-Americans, Koreans, and Caucasians -- build over the course of the film. These tensions eventually reach a boiling point, and the ensuing chaos (which will not be discussed due to massive spoilers), serves as a powerful social and political commentary. Over thirty years after its release, watching Do the Right Thing is frighteningly similar to the horrific violence enacted against unarmed black individuals practically every single day in the United States. Despite the graphic brutality of Do the Right Thing, the reality of this violence is even worse than what is able to be shown on screen. When compared to the other films in the module, Napoleon Dynamite and The Great Dictator, Do the Right Thing is by far the most striking in terms of its current relevance, as the violence shown mirrors many current news stories. Spike Lee also dedicated the film to the families of six black individuals, five of whom were killed by the police.There are many cinematic devices that cause Do the Right Thing to stand out from other dark comedy-dramas, especially in terms of the film's use of intense camera angles (a hallmark of Lee's filmmaking). Throughout the film, Lee uses different types of high and low camera angles in order to explore the various power imbalances amongst the characters. Additionally, he also utilizes cinematic Dutch angle shots, which have the effect of being disorienting for the viewer. These shots become more pronounced as the film progresses, which emphasizes the spiraling chaos of the storyline.This film is incredibly important viewing, especially considering the racial reckoning that has been taking place in the U. S. within the last few years. I would recommend Do the Right Thing, with the caveat that it is unbelievably difficult to watch at points due to the realistic depiction of racial violence, especially if police brutality is emotionally triggering for the individual viewer. However, if one is looking for a more lighthearted comedy, I would suggest another film in this module - Napoleon Dynamite.",

This movie is what happens when a group of talented actors buy into the rantings of a 7th grade talent of a writer director such as he. The only redeeming value of this movie is the fact that the actors did a good job with a bad thing. Still, this is one of his better attempts at making a movie.

            "content": "In 1989, Spike Lee decided to release a joint that was a controversy causin', argument startin', extended fourth wall breakin' rant havin', public violence incitin', social commentary makin', moral question philosophizin', poetically stylized cultural snapshot of a story about a hot as hell day in a Brooklyn neighbourhood.\nDo the Right Thing follows a day in the life of pizza delivery man Mookie, played by writer, director, producer, and star Spike Lee, and all the neighbourhood regulars as the summer heat adds pressure to their already tense dynamics. Each of the characters are somewhat odd and unique, while still seeming familiar and relatable. Ossie Davis plays the loveable drunk, Da Mayor, who maintains a wholesome attitude and has several endearing moments of virtue throughout the film, serving as the strong, if not weathered, heart of the community. His attempts at winning the affection of Mother Sister (Ruby Dee) are persistent, but never cross the line of being inappropriate. His selfless and admittedly foolish reflex to do the right thing, such as when he saves a boy from being hit by a vehicle, gains him respect from Mother Sister and most of the community, with the exception of a young man who berates him as the cause of his own problems even as Da Mayor pleas that the man doesn't know what he's been through. Although certainly cruel, even this random angry young man believes that he is doing the right thing by explaining his views of homelessness and its causes.\nWhether morally commendable or not, all of the characters in Do the Right Thing are trying to do exactly that, even in acts of violence. Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) blasts Public Enemy wherever he goes, aggressively standing his ground against the power, while Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito) more vocally fights for the black man's place on the wall of fame in his community. Is pizza shop-owner Sal (Danny Aiello) not also entitled to stand behind his own decisions about his business? When everyone feels compelled to take action against injustice, friction is inevitable, violence and destruction are often the result.\nThere is a surreal moment halfway through the film when the characters directly address the camera with rants filled with racial slurs. This is one of the ways Spike Lee uses artistic techniques to tell the truth. It is in these moments of poetic realism that the film is able to evoke the climate of the culture at that time and highlight societal sentiment in an honest way.\nThe two quotes at the end of the film from leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcom X, who Smiley (Roger Guenveur Smith) has been parading photos of throughout the movie, articulate the paradox of violence and the struggle to do the right thing in the face of oppression. And as Samuel L. Jackson's Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy would say, \"That's the double truth, Ruth.\"",

I remember when I first heard of \"Do The Right Thing\". I was a freshman in college. I had wondering into a local used bookstore and found Lee's \"Do The Right Thing Companion Book\". Flipping through it I was it had his film journal about trying to get the movie made, and the script. I bought it and read the whole thing in one night. I instantly had to see the movie.\nI stopped by our local video store and got the tape, DVDs were semi-new at this time. Watching the movie, I was transfixed by what I was seeing on screen. It felt so alive and this was at least 10 years after it had already come out. Then came the ending...Now for full disclosure I am a white male, my reaction at the end of the movie was one of confusion. In my mind, Mookie had NOT in fact done the right thing. Danny Aiello played Sal as a super likeable guy who loved his business and loved the neighborhood. To see Mookie, who Sal had in fact kept employed even though he was a terrible worker, throw a trash can through his window and help destroy Sal's was a mind-boggling decision, but like I said I am a white.Its my opinion that Spike created a sort of Rorschach Test for the audience. Was I feeling this way because as a white person I had never had to face much oppression? That's why I think it was so genius. It makes you think about your place in this world and in the end he gives you an unanswerable question, What is the best way to deal with hate?",

            "content": "Do The Right Thing was directed by Spike Lee and released in 1989. The story chronicles a diverse set of characters on one hot, summer day in a Brooklyn, NY neighborhood as tensions rise. Spike Lee also plays the central character, Mookie, who lives in the neighborhood and delivers pizzas on foot for Sal (played by Danny Aiello). Sal's pizzeria has been a neighborhood fixture for years. It is clear that this area has changed and become more diverse since Sal first opened. The ensemble cast includes John Turturro as Pino, Sal's oldest son who holds anger and racist views towards the neighborhood. Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee give superb performances as Da Mayor and Mother Sister, respectively, two older members of the community who try to watch over the residents in their own way.Similar to Jon Hess's 2004 film, Napoleon Dynamite, Do The Right Thing is an engaging examination of the intersection of cultures and class in America. Both films use intriguing and often over-the-top characters (eg, Kip and Radio Raheem) against a realistic backdrop of communities that the directors know well. Like Hess, Lee sets his story and shoots the film in his hometown. This leads to an authenticity and a unique sensibility for the complexities of the community that strongly resonates in the film.It is exactly these racial and class complexities that makes Do The Right Thing such a timeless film. The movie was released almost two years before the infamous \"Rodney King video\" was shown to the world and presaged the subsequent Los Angeles riots. The King video was recorded by an onlooker of a group of policemen beating a black man, Rodney King, after a traffic stop. It is this undercurrent of racial tension and heavy-handed policing that made Do The Right Thing a controversial examination of race relations and interactions. Unfortunately, its themes remain equally relevant today.Lee uses the technique of actors speaking directly into the camera, or breaking the fourth wall, to great effect. He sometimes does this when he wants to place the viewer in the position of one of the characters. For example, when a group of young kids taunt and demean Da Mayor, Lee focuses the camera on the group of kids. The viewer sees this from Da Mayor's position, looking up from a stoop where he's sitting. Da Mayor is being verbally abused by kids who understand nothing of his struggles in life. They only see him as a drunk old man. Lee also uses this technique during a powerful scene where multiple characters hurtle racial epithets. This forces the audience to be on the receiving end of this onslaught.With an incredible cast, a script with realistic dialogue, and multifaceted characters, Do The Right Thing forces the audience to contemplate race relations in America from multiple viewpoints. Our society is still grappling with the questions raised by the film thirty years ago.",

            "content": "Review for ART 1145 American Cinema - Do the Right Thing\nDo the Right Thing is a film directed, written, produced, and starring Spike Lee. This 1989 comedy-drama is a powerful and politically relevant story about racial tensions and police brutality in the black community. Throughout the movie, we see follow multiple people about in Bedford-Stuyvesant on one of the hottest days of the year. While the film starts off seemingly light-hearted and harmless, rising racial tensions and resentments seem to flare which leads to an explosive climax filled with violence, rioting, and hate. Spike Lee mentioned that he got his inspirations from two racially motivated attacks such as the killing of Howard Beach that happened in 1986, and the police shooting of Eleanor Bumper that happened in 1984. He also got inspiration from the Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode \"Shopping for Death,\" where the main premise and discussion was that hot weather increases violent tendencies.This movie was masterfully produced and cast, each scene of this film filled with popping and vibrant colors, and the actors popping with intense emotions. As we watch the film, we see a variety of bright reds, greens, blues, and yellow, and as the day goes on it getting deeper and darker, matching the tone and mood of the situation. The actors also portray their roles well, whether it's comedic or serious, the dialogue is natural and raw, making watching the movie very real and personal.This 32-year-old film is still extremely relevant, considering that racial tensions between communities and police brutality against African Americans are still prevalent. As an African American woman, this film hit really close to home, considering this is what goes on within my community all the time. Especially with the huge case of George Floyd that happened in 2020, and the anger the community felt that lead to the protests and riots in Minneapolis-Saint Paul and quickly made global. Whether it was the right thing or not, the point that this was brutal and unnecessary murder was made, and now justice is served, and the community is healing. Like my headline said, this is the unapologetic and repeated truth, a very real and vicious cycle in the community that will only be healed once police reform, cultural unity and understanding are met. But only time will tell when that comes full circle.",

            "content": "Released in 1989, \"Do the Right Thing\", was written, produced and Directed by Spike Lee. He put together a terrific cast with big names such as Samuel L. Jackson, Martin Lawrence, and John Turturro. This film focuses on Racism in America. The story is centered around the complexity of relations between nations and the tension built between them that turned into extreme violence, and eventually death. It shows how some people choose to react to discrimination. It accurately portrays society in America in the 80s, even now, and demonstrates how one argument can destroy a community. The central themes in the movie are the violence caused by racial intolerance and uncontrolled police brutality.The movie takes place in a predominately African American and Hispanic Neighborhood in Brooklyn, NY, where the majority of the residents get along. One of the characters, Buggin out (played by Giancarlo Esposito), has an unfriendly history with one of the few White residents in the neighborhood, Sal, who owns an Italian pizzeria. Sal has a wall of fame of only famous Italian Americans. Buggin out is offended by the lack of African American representation on the wall as the majority of the residents in the neighborhood are Black. As Sal refused to hang up pictures of African Americans, Buggin out teams up with Radio Raheem (played by Samuel L. Jackson) and marched into his restaurant with blaring music to force him to do it. Sal gets angry and broke Radio Raheem's music player. Furious, Radio Raheem attacked Sal and the police were called. When they arrived at the scene and tried to arrest Radio Raheem, he fought back and that lead to him getting choked to death by an officer. The community was enraged and burned down Sal's place. Sal is a serious business owner and is known and liked by everyone, and it is crazy how one confrontation can take a tragic turn.Do The Right Thing is one of the most controversial and talked about movies of the 80s. It contains strong and vile language that makes it more realistic. Spike Lee used Dutch angles when he tilts the camera, high and low angle shots and also zoomed on the characters. It is concerning to see that more than 30 years later so little has changed as African Americans are still dealing with racial tension, discrimination, and police brutality. I really like this movie and recommend it. Although it focuses on a much bigger issue which is sad, there are some funny scenes that makes you laugh.Unlike the comedy film Napoleon Dynamite directed by Jared Hess, Do the Right Thing uses a beautiful mix of comedy while focusing on racial injustice.",

            "content": "The movie do the right thing was directed by Spike Lee and produced in 1989. The film takes place in the BedStuy neighborhood in New York. The message was about poverty, race, and culture. The Bedstuy neighborhood had parallels to the Jewish Ghetto except the Bedstuy neighborhood was more diverse. The movie starts with introducing what life is like in the neighborhood. The main characters are Sal (Danny Aiello), \"Da Mayor\" (Ossie Davis), \"Buggin Out\" (Giancarlo Esposito), \"Mookie\" (Spike Lee), Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn), and Pino (John Turturro). Sal owns the neighborhood pizza shop called Sal's famous pizza. Mookie works as the delivery person. Pino is Sal's son who also works at the pizza shop. The cast is racially diverse and highlights interactions built on race. Racial slurs are thrown around, some which I hadn't heard before. A theme in the film is the heat because it was the hottest day of the year. The movie gets its name from a point in the middle when Da Mayor tells a passerby to always do the right thing. The inciting incident to the climax was a strike on Sal's Famous Pizza and the climax was a violent outburst between Sal and folks in the neighborhood. This resulted in the death of Radio Raheem. The social justice issue here is police brutality. Police brutality is actually a multi-racial issue and it's important to note not all perpetrators are white. However, the majority of victims of police brutality are black and it is a tragedy. Compared to The Great Dictator movie this one shared a theme of social justice.

His anger comes from him thinking that Sal is racist but how can you sit and eat in the same pizzeria for 10 or more years and only get mad about something when you, for the first time, stop and look at your surroundings.

This comment rings with truth, considering every major character ultimately resorts to violence.  Mookie sometimes tries to rationalize with his friends, and also tells `Buggin Out' to stop yelling at Sal, but it didn't seem like he wanted to.  He was torn between being black, and respecting his employer.  The movie would have been much better if it focused on Mookie's personal debate over staying true to his roots, and siding with `Buggin Out,' or trying to keep order, not advocating violence. While the film sometimes delves into this subject, it seems the movie's main attraction was the destruction at the end.  Death, fire, rage are all powerful human emotions, but they have become so clich\u00e9, that an abstract look at Mookie's dilemma would have accentuated the `peace' message. But the movie, instead, decides to concentrate on dealing out racial stereotypes by the dozen.  Most of the Africans are rude, all the Orientals run convenience stores, often quoting the notorious `You buy, or you go!,' the Italians are racist, and the cops are lazy. What escapes me, however, is Lee's logic in thinking that race riots, vulgarities, and one constant song would display the disgusting nature of racism, and racially motivated violence, coupled with the fact that none of the characters involved exhibit any form of respect, dignity, or moral aptitude.  They are always at each other's throats, always bickering, never thinking about or even rationalizing their actions.  The one thing on their mind is violence. The next day only emphasizes this by the way Lee displays the town. Nothing has changed.  Nobody presents any negative effects (excluding Sal).  Mookie, the one character who had a conscience, only goes to Sal for money.  There is no remorse, no call for change.  The people involved in destroying life and property don't give a second thought to the effects of their actions. This movie annoyed me.  Not by the message, but by the dialogue.

Second thing I liked was where the main character wanted his money from the Italian guy and he gave him the money but the main character gave some money back because of what he owed him. And instead of taking everything he was honest about it. Third thing I liked was where the old man was trying to impress the lady who sat by the\nwindow. He did all these gentlemen things just to make her smile. That was cute. One aspect that annoyed me was where Pino was acting like a fool and that dude just had anger issues. Always yelling at somebody or always starting problems. Like he needs to relax. One way it was realistic was when the cops were carrying someone's body out of the situation as if nothing happened. In real life that's what happens with cops. One family dynamic I thought the director emphasized was violence between the community because within the community there are some people you may not like or maybe a race. In this movie it shows the dislike we have towards one another. But once problems start we try to come together and fix it.",

            "content": "I thought that the window part was done in his own self defense. When the riot somewhat settled down there was a distinct space between the black people and the white people. Mookie was on the side with the whites. As enraged as the blacks were, I felt that if he didnt do anything, then he would be somewhat of a traitor to his black community and their rage would unleash onto all four of them. Since his life was crappy anyways, his accidental child, poor work ethics, and lack of education, while living with his sister, the only thing he really had was the respect from his friends, which he wanted to keep. By throwing the trash can he made a statement saying that he is with his own kind on this riot.",

One: Mookie (Spike Lee) did not portrayed any emotions throughout the movie. Also lack of facial expression. Two:The girlfriend of Mookie was not seen much through the movie.The reasons why I do like this movie. One:Radio raheem: The part when he was explaining love vs hate. It had really touched my heart it made me look at it a different way. Two:Spike Lee had really caught the racial tension in Brooklyn, New York.Overall I think all HS students should see this movie to understand life in NYC.",

            "content": "Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing is the most impactful and easily controversial films I have ever watched while also being an amazing movie. I believe it is a necessary film for the public to watch due to the similarities to our time now. The way Spike Lee used his characters like Mookie, Buggin Out, Pino, Sal, Vito, and Radio Raheem to show the spectrum of the people involved at the time is intelligent. We have the strong personalities of both sides like Buggin Out and Pino while also having the more tolerant ones like Vito and Mookie. Throughout the movie, Vito is the more tolerant of the two Italian brothers and even sees Mookie as a friend. At the same time, Pino is brutally racist to anyone of a different race and is not afraid to express it while they stand in front of him. Due to these choices by Spike Lee, the characters might come off too exaggerated and stereotypical to some viewers which defeats the purpose of what Spike Lee was trying to do. I listed Radio Raheem because he is an incredibly important character. Raheem is quiet throughout the film, but the way he walked around blasting Fight the Power. He is silently expressing his anger over the oppression his people experience every day which many characters seem to support. To me this symbolism proves to be true due to the outrage that happens directly after his death. Like I said before, Mookie is one of our neutral characters, but once Raheem is killed, he is the first to react. Spike Lee made this film to show that everyone reaches a breaking point with so much aggression or oppression. That is why I feel that this is an important film to watch due similar occurrences being reflected today. Those of us who do not regularly experience oppression or racism can watch this film and feel this due to the way Spike Lee filmed it. It might make some uncomfortable or have some not like the film, but it still stands as something different that will grab attention. It is almost unreal to watch a film made to show racism in the 80s and being so similar to racism that we see or could possibly experience in 2019. That is my biggest reason as to why people should watch this film. The times have changed yet our attitudes and tolerance of others still reflect the same.",

            "content": "SPOILER ALERT: Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing is a marvelous film that provides the viewer with a rather fascinating but unusual experience, and inevitably provokes discussion between viewers through various controversial issues. The way Lee constructed the film almost gives the feeling that no plot exists at all. While most films tend to follow a single character, Lee crafted his film to jump from character to character. For example, the film goes from following the workers in the pizzeria, to three men sitting on a bench, and then back to the pizzeria with somewhat sudden transitions. This is a hinderance to the experience of viewing the film because it can be easy to feel lost and difficult to recall the order that certain events occur during various scenes. At the same time, this is also beneficial because it makes you feel like you are in the neighborhood with the characters in every scene. The scenes with the three men chatting on the bench give the feeling that you could join in on the conversation and the scenes with the unruly mobs give the feeling that you are trapped in the middle of the crowd. The jumpy transitions from character to character also allow for many different angles and opinions on the controversial issues that arise. Lee utilizes these controversial issues to leave his viewers deep in thought over questions that don't necessarily have simple answers. Some of the controversial issues Lee introduces are whether colored people should be displayed on the wall of the pizzeria, whether Radio Raheem's death was in vain, and whether Mookie did the right thing by throwing the trash can through the window of the pizzeria. Lee does a fantastic job of using these issues to serve as a medium for debate over the racial tensions that the film presents. Do the Right Thing is not your typical movie experience, but the feeling that the film gives of being alive combined with the thought-provoking aspect makes it a must-see.",

            "content": "Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing provided excellent examples of racial prejudice and discrimination on a daily basis. The entirety of the film is set in Brooklyn, New York in an area that was predominately colored during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The use of the setting provides insight into what life was like during this time period. Lee's use of New York as the setting shows the several different areas of Brooklyn with different cultures and ethnicities and how they all coexisted. For example, the film showcases several different races and cultures with characters like Sal (who owns the pizzeria,) the Korean Market owners, the Hispanic group that gathers outside of their apartment and the many African American characters such as Mookie and Buggin' Out. Another detail Lee used to enhance the film was the use of music. The song choice throughout the film provided a story of different cultures within itself. This can be seen in scenes where the character Radio Raheem brings his boom box, which is always playing rap, up to the groups of Hispanic people, who are playing their own Latin music. With the simple use of music, opposing cultures can be seen.\nIf you're not into violence in film, this probably isn't a film for you. The film becomes increasingly difficult to watch as scenes of police brutality are shown. There is a particular scene with the character Radio Raheem which starts off quite intense and ultimately leads to his brutal death by white police officers. The movie also ends after a violent riot scene leaves Sal's pizzeria in shambles and several others injured. While the film uses topics like police brutality and violence to enlighten the viewers, it is quite hard to stomach. The violence factor became a real turn off and made the remainder of the film is difficult to watch. The overall film uses comedy and drama as a way to educate viewers on the importance of ending racism and prejudice, and its negative effects on other cultures and society as a whole. This film is an excellent film to show young adults, perhaps college students, to enlighten them on the importance of being tolerant towards all people.",
