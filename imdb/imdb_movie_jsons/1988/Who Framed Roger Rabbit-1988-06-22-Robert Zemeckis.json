            "content": "I was a little surprised that \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" wasn't on the top 250. Almost everyone loves this film. It was a major breakthrough for movies. The cartoon world meets reality.Bob Haskins is to die for in this film, he plays such a great American detective and he didn't have much to work with. After all when he was talking to Roger, he wasn't really talking to anybody since it was a cartoon character. I love the way he develops his role so much, how he goes from this stick-to-the-book and all cartoons are bad to this lovable goofy guy due to Roger's insatiable love for life and cartoons. It's silly because it's a cartoon, but Roger and Bob clicked so well and are unforgettable.Christopher Lloyd... shudder! This guy gave me so many nightmares as a kid from his character as the judge. The ending where he reveals his true form, he is just terrifying and effective. Jessica Rabbit is so cool and sexy for a cartoon. She's just too much fun for this movie and is wonderful as a cartoon. \"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way\". My favorite scene is without a doubt when Eddie(played by Bob) is looking for Jessica and meets the crazy look-a-like in Toon Town. Just great and hilarious. Come on, fans! This is a terrific movie and deserves to be on the top 250 films of all time! It's a break through for cinema history and movies in general. It's a great one! I'd highly recommend this for the family and friends or just a Saturday with nothing to do.10/10",

Think about how their respective owners had to put aside decades of competing against each other for gags that would last a few seconds of screen time.  Realise that, before this movie, the idea of combining fully rendered animated characters with live action footage was considered impossible.  And how the hell do you market a movie that includes both murder plots and fuzzy little cartoons?This movie is a miracle.I absolutely loved it as a kid, and although parts of it flew over my head I really did not care.  I did know that this is what animation can do when all the \"rules\" are totally ignored.  And why shouldn't they be?Now, as an adult, I appreciate \"Roger Rabbit\" for its gutsyness.  There is absolutely *nothing* like this anywhere.  It gets a solid Ten.",

The live action with the animation was perfectly blended, and I was howling with laughter at the beginning. The story is perfect, about a rabbit framed for a murder, when he suspects his wife of cheating on him. Bob Hoskins was brilliant as the melancholy drunk private eye, while Christopher Lloyd has great fun as the very scary villain. I would never have guessed the ending in a million years, totally unpredictable, and quite scary too. The real stars were the toons. Some of the funniest scenes were with them, like Eddie in ToonTown, and the weasels were a blast. reminded me of the Untouchables, actually. I didn't know for ages, that Kathaleen Turner voiced Jessica Rabbit, wow that woman is beautiful. Turner voiced Jessica brilliantly. in conclusion, a hugely satisfying part animated comedy, that both kids and adults will love. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It pitches it's animated rabbit to the kids, and for the teens and adults, they can look for humor in other things.  The plot is a complicated one (like most detective mysteries) that brings a drunken detective back to the detective game of cartoons.  Sometimes funny, sometimes compassionate, always entertaining.

The animated title character has been framed and now he is out to clear his name with the help of a human detective (Bob Hoskins).  Robert Zemeckis cemented his ability to make a film with this winner.  The special effects, which are remarkable, never detract from the story and in the end they add a great dimension to this fine motion picture.

Anyways this was my childhood favorite and perhaps an all time, and will always be a favorite to me. Every time I watch there is a magic moment, that the cartoons we all loved as kids are still the best today, even though we are into computer animation, Batman, X-Men, or anime, we can never say we hate those old Looney Toons or Disney shows. And the antics and jokes and gags and gimmicks they did will always remain the funniest, even though we dig jokes from Saturday Night Live or sex jokes these days. This is also the first time I've seen Disney and Warner cartoons for the first time! And not to mention Betty Boop and Droopy! Overall, this is the best animated and live movie the whole family can enjoy, and fans of the old cartoons will love. Recommended to all fans of cartoons of the golden years of Disney and Warner. Thank you Disney, thank you Warner. And if liked this, I recommend you play the video game Kingdom Hearts, this time it's Final Fantasy/Squaresoft and Disney together! >>>> 10/10",

The movie is great fun for the whole family..there is a little innuendo but like Jessica says..\"I'm not bad..I'm just drawn that way\"A real treat!

            "content": "That WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT was made at all is a marvel to me-- I'm sure getting all the studios that owned these characters to agree to let them all on the screen was a real feat-- but I have no doubt it was made at just the right time in movie history. The 80s saw an upswing in interest in the classic Hollywood animations of the 30s and 40s, and the 70s nostalgia for classic noir was still lingering, leading to classics like BODY HEAT. Somehow, this led to a perfect combination of ideas. The special effects technology of the 1980s also allowed the fusion of live action and animation to be done in a manner far more sophisticated than past decades.So yeah, I consider ROGER RABBIT a great film. The story is both a spoof of noir conventions and a dramatic story you can take just seriously enough, populated by memorable and endearing characters. Everyone does great work, but you have to give it to Bob Hoskins, who toes the line between comedy and hardboiled drama well. It's often described as a kid's movie, though with the sheer amount of sexual jokes and extreme cartoon violence, I am shocked some moral watchdog has yet to complain (at least, I've never heard of anyone complaining about this movie's content, not even from those who think things like HAPPY FEET and HARRY POTTER were directed by Satan himself).The idea of a sequel was in talks for a few years, but to be real, I am glad they never came to be. In our age of rehashes and reboots and sequels twenty to thirty years after the fact, it's been proven repeatedly that you just can't re-catch lightning in a bottle.",

            "review_title": "A unique movie experience",
            "content": "\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is a wonder in the art of making films. Because it mixes live-action and cartoons, it was a challenge to be made. But that's exactly what makes it so distinguish and unique, especially considering that the idea works out so well. It's a different and original movie experience, a real winner.Yet, the film is more than a combination of live-action and cartoons. It has a dark atmosphere with lots of suspense, almost like a thriller. Classic humor isn't forgotten either, with numerous funny lines and hysterical gags, as well as humorous characters. The joke about \u00abuncle Thumper\u00bb is one of the funniest, but there are many others. There's also a hilarious piano acting with Donald Duck and Daffy Duck, which they play the same piano song as in Tom & Jerry's short \"The Cat Concerto\" and have their hilariously silly battle. In fact, the soundtrack of the movie is excellent, including Jessica Rabbit's song \"Why don't you do right?\" and a suspense music very similar to one from the original \"Back to the Future\".Other movies that successfully mix live-action and cartoons are \"Mary Poppins\", \"Pete's Dragon\" and \"Bedknobs and Broomsticks\". Like \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", those three movies combine this \"marriage\" very well. On the other hand, other movies such as \"Space Jam\" tried this idea but without the same success.I believe that this movie was made in a unique moment of inspiration. The sceneries are great, the designs, the cartoons, the backgrounds, the details, the animation, the special effects, the artwork... everything was carefully made and I much welcome that. This is one of the greatest Disney films.Great actors make the difference too. Bob Hoskins is English but speaks with an excellent American accent, not to mention that he does the amazing thing of acting against the air. Joanna Cassidy, Charles Fleischer, Alan Tilvern, Stubby Kaye, Cristopher Lloyd and Kathleen Turner are awesome too. Kathleen Turner is the voice of Jessica Rabbit, with that sexy and sensual voice. And... guess what! Even the singer Frank Sinatra has a minor role in this film as the hilarious but useless Singing Sword. Even without looking at the credits, who wouldn't recognize that great voice? Frank Sinatra's voice is just as recognizable as Nat King Cole's or Sterling Holloway's.As for the characters, the weasels are a perfect example of chronical stupidity. They're humorous because they're always laughing, even though they know what happens to someone who can't stop laughing.Marvin Acme is \u00abthe king of the jokes\u00bb, always humorous and cheerful and at his funniest with his mythical hand-buzzer. Angelo is an idiot, drunk and greedy guy, but funny at the same time. Dolores is a great character. R. K. Maroon is an interesting character with half a dark side and half a good side. Judge Doom is a great villain, humorous, mysterious and somewhat sinister. Roger Rabbit is hilarious and very jolly - that's his only purpose as a cartoon, like he says himself. Jessica Rabbit is a very sexy cartoon, one of the most beautiful and sexiest ever - she's not bad, she's just drawn that way. Benny the Cab is funny. Baby Herman is a bit annoying - he might look innocent at first, but he is extremely rude and he loves to woo women. Eddie Valiant is another great character - grumpy, serious and funny sometimes. And he looks very much like my godfather in appearance.The movie takes place in Hollywood, 1947. It does recreate the 40's very well. That influence is notorious in many ways, including the cars used.Before finishing, let me say that I like rabbits very much. They're adorable and very cute animals, although in the cartoons they aren't as cute - but they're usually funny in cartoons.This should definitely be on Top 250.",

This was a landmark movie, cementing skills from all areas of Hollywood, from the budding special effects industry, to the acting skills of Bob Hoskins, to the SUPERB directing skills of Robert Zemeckis, to create one of the most impressive movies in Hollywood.While this movie was not the first of it's kind, it was definitely the first to have cartoons and real actors interact so seamlessly, and it is impressive that it was made over 15 years ago. Another impressive part of this movie is the soundtrack, using the classic 20's jazz song \"Why Don't You Do Right?\" to bring back the old jazz club scene, to make for a truly authentic feel from a cartoon character, as well as the detective music used all originally composed. All around, this movie is one that I Grew up with, and children and adults will be enjoying for decades to come, because Who Framed Roger Rabbit will be a classic in the movie world for a long long time.",

            "review_title": "A real \"Breeze!\" to watch over and over!",
            "content": "This is for the kid in all of us, those who grew up with cartoons as part of our movie going in the 1930's, 40's and 50's, and in my case, grew up watching the Saturday morning line-up that automatically featured two hours of \"The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner\" show. It will take more than one viewing to catch all of the famous cartoon characters who appear in this film, mostly ones from the early sound era (in the public domain most likely) and those from Warner Brothers and Disney. This is a mixture of animation and film noir, with the human characters and cartoon characters mixing together as if they were part of the same world, although the presence of an area of the Hollywood Hills known as \"Toon Town\" makes the cartoon character's world seem \"segregated'. The film stars Bob Hoskins as a cynical private detective down to the last threads of an agency, desperate for a case, practically any case, but not one preferably concerning \"toons\", as his brother was killed by a \"toon\", which has stereotyped most toons in his book (with the exception of Betty Boop perhaps) as bad.The film opens with a hysterical spoof of the Warner Brothers cartoons with Roger Rabbit the baby sitter for a cookie craving toddler who endangers Roger's life simply by crawling out of his high chair while Roger isn't looking. After this, we learn the truth about \"toon actors\" (he's a 50 year old toon with a 3 month old \"dinkie\", the actor playing the baby garbles), and then get to meet Roger's wife, Jessica, an animated film noir vixen who sings like Amy Irving but talks like Kathleen Turner. Is Jessica a murderous femme fatale who killed off toon town owner Stubby Kaye? Or is she an innocent patty caker who is just content to stay at home and make Roger a carrot cake? As we learn from Betty Boop, work has been hard for some toons ever since cartoons went to color, and the fact that Jessica is the lucky one because Roger Rabbit is a huge star. The dueling Daffy and Donald Duck piano playing sequence proves that not all ducks come from the same pot and that not all of them cackle or squawk in a practically un-hearable manner.Then, there's the evil darkly dressed judge (Christopher Lloyd) who seems to somehow be a distant relative of Disney's evil queens, sorceresses and stepmothers, obsessed with destroying toon town because of his creation of some obscure traveling idea called \"a freeway\". \"Billboards as far as the eye can see!\", Lloyd proclaims, and in order to get this through the valley, he needs to destroy toon town, and that means stopping anybody who can get ahold of Kaye's will. His crew of evil howling hyena henchmen will do anything for either a laugh or a quick buck, and as the audience learns, they literally have the ability to laugh themselves to death.Where there's a femme fatale in film noir, there's also the tired, big hearted waitress, and here, it's Hoskins' long suffering girlfriend, Joanna Cassidy. While Jessica is an animated Rita Hayworth style character, Cassidy is a modern day compilation of Joan Blondell, Ann Sheridan or Alice Faye who essayed that archetype throughout the 1930's and 40's. The details here are fabulous with references to many aspects of the entertainment world of the 1940's, even a reference to the invisible rabbit Harvey. The most popular animated rabbit of all time, Bugs Bunny, does appear, paired with the single most popular mouse in animation history, Mickey. To see these two legendary characters together is ingenious, right after Hoskins encounters a \"piggy picking\" Tweety Bird. Of course, with energy lacking dog Droopy as the elevator pooch, Hoskins already has his hands full when he enters this toon town apartment building.This film created a huge buzz in 1988, having long runs in its premiere and filling up the massive Cinerama Dome on Sunset Blvd. for weeks. Several cartoon short sequels followed, but unfortunately, there was never a sequel, with director Robert Zemickis realizing perhaps there was no way he could top this, so why try? Thirty years after its premiere, it holds up as a classic in every way, with the mixture of animation and live action superb and the 1940's atmosphere brilliant. Even a haunting musical score by Alan Silvestri makes you feel like you've driven into a time tunnel. There are few films that are absolutely perfect, and this would certainly be in most people's top 10 listing of films that are. Whether you are a return viewer to this film for the umpeenth time (and get teary-eyed over the nostalgia that it brings back) or a first time young viewer out to find out why this is so brilliant, it is guaranteed to bring on a smile, many a laugh, and certainly for first time viewers, become a film you will want to revisit again and again...and again.",

            "content": "Watching this for the umpteenth time, I am struck by how much this movie resembles Brazil (1985). What, you will say, that was a grim and serious story set in a horrible dystopia. Ah, yes, but one of its main satirical weapons was its over-the-top humour.Well, Roger Rabbit inverts the formula. We seem to have a zany cartoon comedy. but underlying this is a story about racism and genocide. The cartoon characters, who coexist with humans, are shown as a tolerated subordinated race, good for \"singing and dancing and running and jumping\". They are called \"Toons\", which resembles another epithet that used to be a nasty name for black people. And the \"solution\" is exactly that - a solution of benzene and acetone that will exterminate the Toons by dissolving them.Both movies are set in something that resembles the 1940's, which gives lots of opportunity for spoofing films noir of the sort that Bogart et al. used to make.How could something so serious be funny? The best comedy is just a hare's breadth (sorry, couldn't resist) removed from tragedy, which is why Hogan's Heroes is so funny while Disney comedies fall flat from gooey sentiment. Kids love Roger Rabbit, and that should be the ultimate test of whether it's comic or not.It still amazes me how many grown-ups fail to perceive the underlying message of tolerance and understanding.

For me, one of the most interesting aspects of the movie was seeing Disney and Warner Bros cartoon characters in the same scenes - for the first time in film history, I believe. Who could forget the piano duel of Donald and Daffy? The live actors were a bit theatrical and over-dramatic at times, but not to an extent that would have made the film unbearable or bad.

            "content": "Hard drinking 1940's private eye Eddie Valiant finds himself caught up in another 'toon' case.What we have is a double tribute to Hollywood's golden era of animation and film making. It has a comic take on the hard-boiled, film noir detective story and is populated by both live-action human and cartoon characters.The story works superbly as a compelling mystery and hilarious comedy with both sharp dialogue and sight gags. There is more than a big nod to Roman Polansky's 'Chinatown' as Bob Hoskins' lead character laments over the tragic circumstances of his previous involvement in 'Toontown'.Hoskins is the perfect foil for the outrageously silly title character and the fantastic Christopher Lloyd steals most of the scenes he's in with an almost Alan Rickman-like deadpan performance as the primary antagonist. The inclusion of many Warner and Disney cartoon character cameos is wonderful and serves the main concept of Toontown perfectly.From a technical perspective it is a one off. You only have to google how it was made using layers and layers of hand-drawn, animation cells within the optical compositing process to just imagine how labour intensive it must have been.The reaction this had from an audience at the time I remember vividly as a child of the 80s. When I first saw the scene where Kathleen Turner's Jessica Rabbit sings and struts about the stage interacting with live action characters I thought I was watching actual magic being performed.Movie making has evolved so far now that visual spectacle is simply expected as part of the cinematic experience. The industry is built on the foundation of technology and expertise that can deliver it without too much difficulty. What puts 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' up there with the likes of 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'Star Wars' is that it gave us something we hadn't seen before. What makes it particularly special is that we have never really seen anything like it since.Modern day audiences may not sense the magic the way I did as a child, but I still enjoy it at forty and so does my four year-old daughter watching with me.",

            "content": "Down on his luck Eddie Valiant is hired by cartoon studio producer RK Maroon to help get his main star, Roger Rabbit, to focus on the job rather than his wife.  To do this Valiant is told to get photographs of Jessica Rabbit with another man.  He does this but it only serves to send Roger into a rage and he storms off the lot.  When the man that was photographed with Jessica turns up dead the next day, Roger is wanted by the police and the toon hating Judge Doom.  Roger goes to Valiant to help him, but is there more to the story than meets the eye?I saw this film years ago in the cinema as a child and loved it then just as much as I do now.  The plot is a classic bit of noir - complete with drunken, bitter private dick, a beautiful but untrustworthy femme fatale, plot twists and a patsy.  The twist here is that this is a kids film (more or less) and that it features cartoon characters!  This works well - making it accessible for kids but still clever enough for adults.That's not to say that the adults won't like the cartoons too.  With so many famous characters making cameos there is plenty of cartoons for adults to enjoy.  The humour of the film is quite violent and may not be appropriate for younger children - especially the steamroller scene near the end which I found a little upsetting when I saw this as a preteen.  Regardless of that the film is still pretty funny and can be enjoyed by most, even if kids won't get the plot or references to other movies.Hoskins is good - he fits the rundown noir mould well but can also clown when he has to.  Lloyd is a great bad guy - scary enough to bother kids but not comic to the point that he is a clown character to adults.  Jessica Rabbit sticks in the mind, likely one of the best femme fatales if she were real, she is voiced really well by Turner and the animation fits her voice well.  Fleischer's Roger is good for a cartoon character but it is often the other cartoon characters that are more enjoyable; not only the various cameos but also the weasels and the taxicab.Overall this is a good movie but maybe not for young kids due to the dark edge and some scary scenes.  However for older children and adults this is real good fun - a good plot, a noir atmosphere and a clever twist on the creation of cartoons in the real world.",

With zany classic characters such as Roger, the Weasles, and Benny the Cab. They are original crazy and fun. Also it is a mystery. It plays perfectly as one of those Old 50's detective stories. It is a milestone in film making. The scenes of the \"toons\" and humans sharing a world is great. I think the best scene as special effects go, is the one where Eddie and Roger are handcuffed together in his office. It looks so real!!!!! This movie is fun and creative and will go down in movie history. I don't know what else to say it is simply the best.Also do your self a favor and steer clear of the bad rip off Cool World.",

The only problem is that future live-action animation never lived up to the imagination and shear audacity of this work. The genre becomes mostly kids movies. This is great for kids and for adults who see the influence of classic noirs like Chinatown in this. Bob Hoskins is a great unconventional lead and Jessica Rabbit is the breakout cartoon character.",

Bob Hoskins & Chris Lloyd deserved Oscar nods IMO.WFRR is what most of today's CGI films \"pretend\" to be! A mature, family film that people of many generations can enjoy!Anyone who hasn't seen this film I definitely recommend it! If you like quirky comedies,fantasies, suspenseful films, or are a cartoon geek watch WFRR!...As a huge fan of all things comedic, I love the film's message about laughter! When the film opens, detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is this disenchanted, cynical alkie who hasn't gotten over the murder of his brother who was killed by a toon...Because of this Eddie[ who was once known for his penchant for solving toon-related cases, getting the colorful playful creatures out of trouble] resents ALL toons now and refuses to work for or with them. Too bad Roger Rabbit doesn't know this. He is a toon who is wanted for a murder he didn't commit and hounded by the creepy & corrupt judge/jury/executioner : Judge Doom. Thus he seeks Valiant's help. During their search for the true killer and their evasion of Judge Doom & his weasel cohorts, Eddie wonders how Roger can have such an exuberant clownlike spirit in the face of possible death. Roger tells Eddie \"a laugh can be a very powerful thing, why sometimes in life it's the only weapon we have.\"The tone of the film is a mixture of dark noir frenetic tooniness a sultry yet strong damsel (the one and only Jessica Rabbit) and social racial allegory.The film's theme of minorities (the toons) vs. genocide & \"the man\" (Judge Doom)....And of Eddie's prejudices against toons (due to his brother's murder) disappearing at the end, thus he overcomes his alcoholism and grief or Roger's very motto of \"Laughter is a powerful weapon\" and how that helps Eddie in the final showdown (by killing the weasels with laughter and thwarting Judge Doom with a toon prop that malfunctions his diabolical machine). American Pop-culture & escapism ARE powerful weapons against misery, hatred & life's hardships in general. And they help unite all different walks of life.WFRR takes place in the WWII era towards the 50s...While the 40's were a time of American unity, escapism & pop-culture (what the \"toons\" represent) The 50's were more about cold hard, capitalism technology & being superior..I feel that the megalomaniac villain represents THAT as well as the racial/cultural insensitivity that came with the 50's.But no matter how you interpret WFRR it's an American masterpiece! There seems to be some controversy on what age it is appropriate for....Be warned this film IS violent loud climatic and more likely than not, will scare a young child. But if you are a parent you have to know your kid and realize what will give him or her nightmares. Having said that, even if you won't let junior watch it, that doesn't mean you, yourself can't enjoy it, the next time it comes on Encore Mystery. There are a lot of \"Judge Dooms\" these days...People who are perpetually serious & full of themselves & really have NO sense of humor at all...Don't be a Judge Doom...Watch this movie!",

In the process, Eddie discovers that this all relates to his past. \"The studios\" were Maroon Studios, the \"soup\" was Dip, and the characters popping up and singing was the scene where Eddie drives into Toontown.\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is a most impressive movie. There had been mixtures of live action and animation before, but this brought it to a new level. One of my favorite scenes was when Daffy Duck and Donald Duck were playing \"Hungarian Rhapsody\" on the pianos and undermining each other's performances.Anyway, this is a most formidable accomplishment, fun for everyone in every way.

Who'd win in a fight, King Kong or Mighty Joe Young? Did Adam and Eve have Belly Buttons? Kids don't realize that different characters belong to different companies and couldn't and wouldn't appear together, or would they?Director Zemeckis, Author Gary K. Wolf and the immense crew, all try to ask and answer a similarly \"impossible\" situational occurrence. Just what if all of Hollywood's animated Cartoon characters were really live creatures called \"Toons\", and what would happen if they had scandals like their human counterparts?Our old suspension of disbelief is supposed to bring us to a Post World War II Hollywood, where we find that the animated cartoon characters that we know from the local movie house, are really living, breathing creatures! Well, after e see the opening, Director Robert Zemeckis has us won over to his side.Private Investigator, Eddie Valiant, is summoned by Movie Mogul R.K. Maroon to his Studio to take a job. Because the subject of the case is their Star Cartoon Character, Roger Rabbit, the Detective balks at accepting the assignment because, \"I don't work for Toons!\"(A Toon being one of these \"living\" cartoon characters.)The economic situation at The Valiant Detective Agency dictates otherwise and Eddie is off. The Game's afoot!As the story unfolds we learn of previous happenings in Valiant's life. We find out that his brother and partner in the Private I business was killed by a Toon in Toon Town, apparently the name for their section of Hollywood/L.A.The story unfolds like an artichoke, revealing a secretive world of crime, illicit sex and political corruption that would be the envy of Dashiel Hammett's Sam Spade, Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe or the Robert Towne/Roman Polanski collaboration on CHINATOWN(1974).Like the meandering of a great river, the plot twists and turns wherein we finally have the answer to the Roger Rabbit's accused whodunnit, but also to the killing of Eddie Valiant's brother, who was_______________! No, that would definitely be a spoiler!The film succeeds on several levels. Obviously it is a great animated feature, and one surely unlike any that have gone before. Chances are there will be other efforts (like the very enjoyable Warner Brother/Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies production of SPACE JAM(1996)starring Michael Jordan, Wayne Knight, Bill Murray, Charles Barkley, Bugs Bunny, Elmer Fudd, Sylvester, Tweety, Taz Devil, Foghorn Leghorn, et al......)It is also a very good spoof of the Hard Boiled Detective story or even the Film Noir genre that had gotten so popular during and (especially) after World War II. The sets, the costuming, hair styles,the fashions and the vintage autos made it very much of a period piece.So, no matter what, this WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT? was nothing special, I mean there's no deep meaning, no symbolism, no message-right? Well, I'm not so sure. Please, indulge me and check out what follows.Well, to begin with Eddie Valiant expresses a deep dislike for this certain group, these TOONS. His brother was killed by a TOON. The two brothers had been cops in TOON TOWN. And when the mention was made of that INK AND PAINT Club, followed by the caveat,\"Humans Only!\"Now, can you think of any real life situation that would put you to thinking about this situation? Where did we have sections of a city that were occupied by one group but had entertainment establishments that catered to those from outsider their local community? Was there or is there still sections of a city referred to as being (Blank!)Town? Maybe it's just my overactive imagination!But, I don't think so.",

I saw it countless times, never found a flaw, and I could count the qualities until the day after tomorrow. The story is simple but well-written, the combination of the noir atmosphere and the atmosphere of short cartoons is captivating, and one-liners are hilarious. This is the only film in which Disney and Warner characters appear together on the screen, and there are also several characters from other studios. The film has several parallels to \"Chinatown\" and \"Back to the Future\", and it parodies or pays homage to many more iconic movies and characters. It is full of awesome details that you have no chance to notice all during just one viewing, and for some it is necessary to watch the movie in slow motion because they are put in single frames.What fascinates me most about this movie is that computer animation wasn't used at all. Everything was done old-school and 326 animators hand-drawn over a million drawings, of which nearly one hundred thousand frames were used in the movie. With 70 million dollars invested, this is the most expensive film of the 80's. It had six Academy Awards nominations, out of which it won three. I must also mention the excellent music by Alan Silvestri (Fandango, Cat's Eye, Back to the Future franchise, Predator, Young Guns II, The Bodyguard, Judgment Night, Forrest Gump, Judge Dredd, Identity, Van Helsing, Night at the Museum, Captain America, The Avengers).I recommend this movie to everyone, and if you end up amazed like me, you can find tons of interesting trivia online.

Roger Rabbit himself was a VERY annoying character--I could care less what happened to him. The storyline was vague and more than a little confusing--it kept coming to a screeching halt countless times when a \"toon\" made a cameo.

This could've easily been a by-the-numbers children's plot, but to make it a murder mystery instead was bold. Incredibly bold, yet it works so well. It's just genius. The whole concept of toons interacting with humans and how their worlds are linked is nothing short of brilliance. The technology used at the time was groundbreaking. Green screen aplenty, stunt work with wires and perfect sound effects editing, this is a technical masterpiece. The compelling plot with memorable characters is the icing on the cake. The whole \"being forced to work together to save the day\" concept has been done many times and is a rather tired formula, that is literally my only complaint. Oh, and certain scenes where animation and reality didn't blend particularly well (very very very minor gripe). But my God this film is amazing. I think what's more impressive is the idea that these rivalling animation studios (Disney, Hanna Barbera etc.) actually agreed to have their properties in one film. Together. Which really creates the perfect \"ToonTown\" so to speak. It harks back to my childhood. Having Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse on screen together, I would never have thought it. The nostalgia just took over the film and made it a much more personal viewing for me. The cartoonish antics of objects falling on them, running into walls or inanimate objects being able to speak.

Roger, the fun-loving Toon star of Maroon Cartoons, is married to a beautiful Toon woman, Jessica Rabbit, and Roger had become distraught that she may have been having an affair with his boss Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye), and Acme himself later turns up dead, with Roger as the #1 suspect. As Eddie digs deeper and deeper into his investigation, he soon finds himself on the run and having to journey to Toontown (the home of all the Toons in Hollywood), one of the last places on Earth he wants to be for reasons I'll explain later. This was one of my favorite movies from my childhood (I was three when it was originally released), and it still is after happening upon a recent viewing of the picture, and I only recently discovered that it was not an original piece as I once believed, but it's adapted from the novel \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit?\" by Gary K. Wolf. Does that mean I love it any less? Of course not. It just gives me more room to appreciate what director Robert Zemeckis and screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were able to do with the story. This movie is fantastic, especially with its mix of comedy, detective-noir, and good old-fashioned murder-mystery whodunit. It's also brilliant for its Oscar-winning special effects, which combine live-action with animation. That's been done before, but I've never seen it done with the care and precision as it's done in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\" The whole movie is like a dream, a dream where people can happily coexist with their favorite cartoon characters, rather than go to the theater for the on-screen antics. Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd from Zemeckis's earlier \"Back to the Future\") is a classic movie villain, with his all-black fatigues, snarl, and typical bad-guy demeanor; there's also a unique twist with his character that you have to see to believe. Bob Hoskins is great as Eddie Valiant, in what is arguably his best-known American film role; growing up, I of course had no idea that he was actually British, but he pulls off his American accent perfectly. One of the things I really like about his character is the resentment he has toward Toons, since one killed his brother several years before this film's story takes place, and his attempts to clear Roger Rabbit of murder charges provides a foundation for him to overcome his hatred. (Am I the only one who spots the obvious parallels to racism here?) \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is a classic comedy/fantasy, and undoubtedly one of my favorite movies. As I stated earlier, a recent viewing allowed me to really see this movie's greatness all over again. I'm glad I'm still in love with it after all these years.10/10",

The plot for the film also borrows many elements from the film noirs of the 1940s, as well as some of the more recent neo-noirs, particularly Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown (1974).' The setting is Hollywood, 1947. For years, humans and cartoon characters (\"Toons\") have co-existed together, though relations have often been a bit frictional. The Toons, when they're not working for the major animation studios, reside in Toon-town, an entirely-animated city that is owned by childlike, gag-gifts supplier Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye). After Acme is found dead, a hefty vault having been dumped on his head, zany and disaster-prone Toon Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) is suspected of the murder, having recently discovered that his beautiful wife Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Kathleen Turner and Amy Irving) had been cheating on him with the deceased. Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is a depressed, drunken and hard-boiled private investigator with a militant dislike of Toons, due to the horrible death of his brother five years earlier, at the hands of an unknown, red-eyed cartoon lunatic. After Roger is accused of murder, Valiant is pressed \u0096 against his wishes \u0096 to uncover the conspiracy and clear the rabbit's name.I genuinely believe that 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' can rank with the very best animated films that Hollywood has produced. Just a quite scroll down its credits page reveals the hundreds upon hundreds of crew members whose tireless efforts painstakingly brought the animated characters to life; every single piece of animation was hand-drawn without the use of computers, and analogue optical effects were also used for adding shadows and lighting to the Toons. The way that the live-actors interact with their animated counterparts is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and no minute detail is left imperfect. These Toons cast shadows, break windows, smash plates on their head, slam doors and grab hold of humans, and all this is achieved convincingly. The main actors, especially Bob Hoskins, keep their performances astonishingly natural, despite presumably communicating with empty space a lot of the time. Even if you don't take the time to consider what a remarkable technical achievement the film is, you are still very likely to fall in love with it; 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' is the most fun I've had watching a movie in quite a few months. At first it seems like a film that only children would enjoy, despite the occasionally dark theme (several murders take place, including the surprisingly shocking \"dipping\" of an animated shoe). However, Robert Zemeckis has succeeded in creating that rare thing \u0096 a picture that is equally entertaining for adults and children alike.",

            "content": "I love this movie so very much, I think it's a sublimely-crafted one-of-a-kind amazing experience of a film to watch on various levels, and I don't believe that there's ever been another one that combined the use of animation and live action that has even come close to the kind of pure magic that was achieved so perfectly with this wondrous little picture back in '88. With every scene you can feel the downright astronomical effort that must have been put into every moment of the movie to make you fall in love with the fantastical world that it presents. They really pulled out all the stops to make you believe that cartoon characters were walking and talking with real world regular people, and nothing is lazy whatsoever about the production of the animation and live-action combinations, they gave the animated characters animated shadows, they had the physical environment reacting to the frequently calamitous movements of the toons as well as the actors reacting to them, such as when Jessica pinches R.K. Maroon's cheeks, and the ultimate hybridisation of the physical and animation stuff is the rather terrifying toon form of Judge Doom! I find it such a joyous marvel to sit through and it was always a big favourite of mine and I love it just as much now as when I was a kid, it gives me a warm feeling just to think of some of the scenes, like the entire sequence at the Pink and Paint Club, and the sweet Betty Boop cameo that saw the voice actress resuming her iconic voice role after fifty years and the way that she seems to be the only toon at that point in the story that Eddie Valiant has nostalgic admiration for. I'm always blown away by the whole opening sequence where Eddie walks down the 40s street to that terrific classy music score while the toons chaotically go about their business everywhere and the film in general seems to come with a sense of nostalgia that's built into its very fabric and atmosphere. I mean you'd have to be totally heartless for there not to be some little thing that you love or appeals to your inner child about it, because if the rich tone, fantastic visuals and great sight gags don't grab you, the characters will! The sadly late but forever great Bob Hoskins was solid in his role and was really the grounding force of the movie as his good old-fashioned down on his luck hard-boiled detective completely contrasts with and reacts to all the weird and wacky characters around him, and undergoes a real arc as he delves deeper into what's going on and uncovers the dark secret that threatens all of the toons and regains his humour, pride, and respect for them along the way. He and Roger made a great unlikely team, and as hyper and loud as he is, Charles Fleischer delivered a voice performance as Roger that was very lovable and endearing, which I think is because he occasionally reigned in his energy a little and gave the manic clownish rabbit moments that help to make him more well-rounded and relateable. And of course he is enormously backed up by his significant other Jessica Rabbit, who arguably stole the show! What a sassy legend the movie made in her, she's so brazenly sexual and it's so hilariously blatant the the way the buxom babe sensuously sashays around in her scenes! She's the most human-like of all the toons and does feel more like a human than one of them, with the exception of her reaction when she's faced with the dreaded Dip! Kathleen Turner gave her the ideal voice that perfectly captured the traits of a classic sultry femme-fatale... And Christopher Lloyd was just phenomenal as the ice cold and utterly ruthless terror of Toon Town, Judge Doom! He's a villain who by his commanding presence alone brings the fear to a generally happily-toned picture - due in no small part I'm sure to the frightening threat that he poses to the seemingly indestructible toons with his Dip, as clearly demonstrated for the audience in the famously chilling moment where a poor helpless shoe gets it! On subsequent viewings the little signs of his true nature are cool to spot, not just the constantly billowing cloak, but how he always avoids the Dip, how he can smell Roger on the record, how he moves kind of stiffly and has odd skin that's almost rubbery and teeth that are too big and white! I love the mystery of Doom, how could a toon who's purpose is supposed to be to bring joy and laughter yet who disguises himself as a stern humourless man, be so completely evil and twisted that he'd concoct an elaborate scheme to ultimately give him the power to eliminate his own kind? When the truth is finally revealed and the mask comes off(sort of), he's finally free to let loose and really goes creepily crazy with it!! I think what would have made a perfectly great happy ending even better, would have been if they'd have made a kind of callback to the poignant early scene in Eddie's office, by showing new pictures of Eddie and Delores on their planned vacation, joined by Jessica and Roger this time, and maybe some showing that Eddie and Roger had teed up as a new detective duo: Valiant and Rabbit! I think Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a solid gold classic because not only is it a fantasy come to life and a loving homage to the beloved animated characters of yesteryear, but also because it creates such an amazing alternate reality within the world of the movie that feels so rich and alive and fun to watch and that you'd love to be a part of and is so memorable and precious, it's a glorious celebration of childhood joy, animation, ingenuity, and the imagination.

            "content": "Eddie Valiant, an LA private-eye in the forties, is hired to take incriminating photos of Jessica Rabbit, the wife of cartoon star Roger Rabbit, whom it seems is two-timing her husband with wealthy businessman Marvin Acme. When Acme turns up dead, Roger is the chief suspect and is ruthlessly pursued by the sinister Judge Doom and his weasel henchmen. Roger, protesting his innocence, hides out with Eddie, who discovers that he is just a pawn in a far larger plot to develop real-estate by destroying Toontown. Eddie sets out to clear Roger and save Toontown.Who Framed Roger Rabbit, based on a book by Gary K. Wolf, is a great movie on three levels; as a dramatic rites-of-passage story about a grief-stricken alcoholic throwing away the booze and avenging his brother's death, as a supercool private-eye movie in the classical style with a fabulously villainous plot, and as a gleefully hysterical cartoon comedy stuffed with great gags. From the brilliant opening cartoon featuring Roger and Baby Herman to the fantastic final battle in the Acme warehouse, the film is just brimming with visual invention. Made just prior to the advent of CG effects, it is a milestone of achievement in combining live action and animation, supervised by Richard Williams (who also does the voice of Droopy). The photography by Dean Cundey and music by Alan Silvestri are both superb. Hoskins is one of those rare gems of seems-totally-wrong-but-turns-out-perfect casting - he is phenomenal, completely undaunted by the huge scope of the movie, giving a completely straight dramatic performance the film anchors itself upon, and somehow adding real depth to a character who is mostly clich\u00e9 and fantasy. Equally terrific is Fleischer, who imbues Roger (and three other characters) with a fantastic voice, ably supported by Questel, Blanc and Foray, all of whom were cartoon-voice stars from the golden age of animation. Jessica Rabbit is the sexiest cartoon character this side of Ralph Bakshi, and Turner's vocal is gloriously husky (Irving also voices her for a great torchsong). Equally memorable is Lloyd as the truly terrifying, no-redeeming-features Judge Doom, with his toon-killing Dip and his horrific get rich quick scheme to shut down public transport and sell land bordering the new freeway (\"You lack vision. But I see a place where people get on and off the freeway. On and off, off and on, all day and all night. Soon, where Toontown once stood will be a string of gas stations, inexpensive motels, restaurants that serve rapidly-prepared food, tyre salons, automobile dealerships and wonderful wonderful billboards reaching as far as the eye can see. My God, it'll be beautiful !!\"). God forbid that kind of society should ever arrive. Cassidy is a terrific game gal, old-timer Kaye does a great turn as the unfortunate Marvin Acme, and bigshot producer Silver has a funny bit as a cartoon director. Everyone in this movie is great !! This is a fabulous homage to the classic cartoons of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery, a stunning piece of film-making and a fantastic movie in a field all of its own.",

Making Roger Rabbit sound like he did, it had the annoying factor of Jar Jar Binks, but Roger was in the movie a lot more than even that annoyance. Bob Hoskins whom I usually say is not really starring role material actually turns in a fairly good performance, but he is overshadowed by Christopher Lloyd who is fantastic in his role as Judge Doom. The voice of Jessica Rabbit is also very well done. The plot has Roger framed of course and the only person that can help prove his innocence is a guy named Eddie, who quite frankly does not like cartoon characters all that much. What is behind the murder, and what crazy stuff will happen in Toon Town? All of this would have been so much better if Roger Rabbit was not apparently on crack. Still, it has a lot to offer, I am sure most kids can overlook how annoying Roger is, and they may even find him very funny, heck most kids laughed at Jar Jar. For me though, if they would replace his voice I would probably have given this movie a seven or eight.",

Although I don't consider it a family film, most of the stuff that likely might concern parents would probably go over the heads of the little children watching it.The film, though, is full of animators' in-jokes. Only someone with an historical perspective of cartoons is likely to get some of the throwaways sneaked into the film. For instance, at one point, Valiant is falling from a height in Toontown, and He's saved by being caught by a Toon woman. We first see her from the back, and we think that possibly she might be Jessica Rabbit. But then we see her face, which is Coyote ugly.Spoilers follow: That's a funny enough sight gag, but the capper is that her face was the winning entry in a contest run by the newspaper comic strip, Li'l Abner. In that strip, there was supposed to be a woman so ugly that her face was never shown. She was Lena the Hyena. Finally, the strip ran a contest to see who could come up with the best face for her, and the result, which I seem to recall, may have been drawn by Basil Wolverton, was what you saw on the screen.Another: near the close of the film, after the brick wall of the warehouse broke open, the first glimpse of the Toontown area we see shows trees and flowers swaying in the breeze. That view was from the first Disney color cartoon, Trees and Flowers. There are other cartoon tidbits scattered throughout the film, and they're fun to spot.A really good film for animation historians, as well as being entertaining.",

            "content": "Robert Zemeckis's Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a groundbreaking film reminiscent of those hard-boiled 40 film-noirs....except animation is used. The whole concept of the movie is combining animation and live action and the results were astounding from a visual perspective. As of publication of this review, this remains the only film where Disney and Warner Brother characters appear with one another. That explains the piano duet with the famous ducks, Daffy and Donald, am I right? From a story perspective, we follow a noir story beat-to-beat. Sometimes the story can fall into \"only for kids\" zone and Roger Rabbit himself is a bit annoying at times, but it is really a blast watching all of our toons come together in live action and look...real!Bless the hearts of director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future), producer Steven Spielberg, animator director Richard Williams, and the hundreds of animators that worked long, long hours to create a film that broke boundaries. The film was released before CGI, so all animation was hand-drawn! Considering Zemeckis and cinematographer Dean Cundey's rapid camera movement, just imagine the difficult work it was for these animators. Even today, everything looked so realistic, so stylish. The movements of the toons were in sync with their live action counterparts. How did this process happen? The live action scenes were shot first with the animation carefully added afterwards. To deliver the best voice performance, the man who voiced Roger Rabbit, Charles Fleischer, decided to dress up as his character on set. I am sure it helped the live actors too.Zemeckis originally wanted to make the film in the early 80's but Disney passed because the director was not a known commodity yet. After the back-to-back box office successes of Romancing the Stone and Back to the Future, Disney felt comfortable enough with him onboard. The movie had the highest budget for any animated film at time and Zemeckis made sure each dollar counted, but he allowed for more risqu\u00e9 (yeah....you know.... Jessica Rabbit) scenes to be added. Because of more mature content, Disney opted to release the film under its Touchstone label. The screenplay, based off the novel from Gary K. Wolf, was written by Jeffrey Price and Peter Seamen. They studied the works of the Golden Age of American animation, and we see their influences. The Looney Tunes. Mickey/Minnie Mouse, all can be found! While filling their script with nostalgia, thankfully enough room was left for an original story involving the toons and humans.The story takes place in Los Angeles in the 1940's. Humans and toons live in a world where they co-exist with one another. Roger Rabbit (voiced by Fleischer) lives an easy life with his wife, Jessica Rabbit (uncredited voice acted by Kathleen Turner). She also happens to be fooling around with the head of Maroon Cartoons. If that was not bad enough, he happened to be found dead and Roger is accused of murder. Enter Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins). He has a personal vendetta against toons, but the down-and-out detective is forced with helping Roger clear his name and escape from the relentless Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd). They must trek all over LA...and even into Toon Town to complete their mission.I can imagine how weird it must have been for the live actors to perform opposite a green screen with no one there (aka the toons). It is a blink of an eye easy for actors now, but not in 1988. That said, everyone delivered admirable performances. Sure, some can occasionally venture into over-the-top territory, but we are talking about toons. Bob Hoskins is reliably great and delivers a deep performance. I think Christopher Lloyd is honored with the best performance. His villain is so memorable. Everything from his black clothes/hat to the fact he does not blink is unnerving. Even Disney officials were concerned he would be too scary for kids. Of course, it was great seeing the toons...which is why the movie exists in the first place. I grew up loving these characters with this movie playing a big part in that. I was not alive when this originally premiered, so I can imagine the awe people had seeing these groundbreaking visuals for the first time.Overall, Who Framed Roger Rabbit should be seen just to see where animation and live action combined for the very first time. In addition to that, we have a story with memorable characters and one straight from the noir era of the 1940's. It mostly works. It holds up very well...even if I find Roger Rabbit himself a bit annoying at times. This film is officially the beginning of the 'Disney Renaissance.\" There would be no The Little Mermaid or The Lion King without this effort from Robert Zemeckis. Backed by a jazzy score from Alan Silvestri, excellent direction from Zemeckis, and beautiful animation from Richard Williams, this film stills holds up very well in the modern world.My Grade: B+",

The jokes and sight gags are non-stop and the actors interact so perfectly with the cartoons that Toon Town seems to be a real place. Bob Hoskins is wonderful as the down-on-his-luck private eye who ends up protecting Roger Rabbit and Christopher Lloyd is equally great (and terrifying) as the evil Judge Doom.

The premise of the movie (an interesting one, I concede) is that cartoon characters (\"toons\") are real beings of some sort with their own existence beyond the pen of the cartoonist, and who even have their own neighbourhood to live in (\"Toon Town\"). More than that, they can even interact with we humans. The live action and animation blend together quite nicely, and Bob Hoskins does a good job of playing Eddie Valiant - even managing to keep a straight face through most of it. (I really enjoyed the scenes in which Eddie Valiant drives an animated car.) So, why do I only rate it a 3?There's a lot of very predictable slapstick humour packed all the way through. It's funny at first but degenerates to boring after a while. There are long scenes which aren't very interesting but are apparently used to allow the \"toons\" to be shown off, which is, I admit, necessary to allow the viewer to get to know some of them. But that leads in to another problem. It's hard to get truly involved with this when the movie for the most part uses cartoon characters who are completely unknown to the viewer; created, apparently, only for this movie. Setting aside the plethora of minor \"toons,\" who is Roger Rabbit anyway? Jessica Rabbit? Baby Herman? The Weasels? We don't know any of these toons! Who framed Roger Rabbit? You want to know the truth? Who cares! I don't even know the guy! Now, if it were \"Who Framed Bugs Bunny\" then I'd be inclined to be rooting for this unjustly accused toon. And why wasn't it? A lot of familiar cartoon characters appeared in the movie - including beloved Bugs - so the producers obviously had permission to use them. Why not focus the movie around characters we know? To me, that would have made far more sense.My last concern is about the conflict (in my view) between the content and the target audience. I'm assuming this is meant as a family movie. (I watched it on Canada's Family Channel.) Given that, I was rather surprised when the disclaimer at the beginning of the movie said that it wasn't appropriate for younger children, and was rated PG. And - fair enough. The content is too mature for the average 7 or 8 year old. But the cartoon nature of the movie makes it rather dull viewing for anyone older than that. It would be OK if you were going to watch it with your kids, but apparently given the rating you're not really supposed to. So - who's supposed to watch this anyway?It's worth a look-see if only for the special effects and for Bob Hoskins good performance, but that's about all.",

            "content": "Based on the 1981 novel Who Censored Roger Rabbit? By Gary K. Wolf, this movie is from a time before crossovers and meta-based films like the latest Space Jam and Ready: Player One. It was incredibly mindblowing as a teen to watch this movie on the big screen and see Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse actually having a conversation.What's even better is that it has a film noir mystery at its center with Bob Hoskins as Eddie Valiant*, a down on his luck private investigator dealing with his hate of animated characters known as Toons which actually exist in this alternate universe.At the time, this was the most expensive animated film ever made, but Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg believed that live-action and animation together would save the cartoon department at Disney.Plus, the studio brought in executive producer Steven Spielberg and his production company, Amblin Entertainment, who would get creative control and most of the box office, leaving Disney to keep merchandising rights.Spielberg went to work getting other studios to lend their characters to the film, getting most of the Warner Brothers characters to appear but sadly failing to get Popeye, Tom and Jerry, Casper the Friendly Ghost or any of the Terrytoons.With live action directed by Robert Zemeckis and animation by Richard Williams - along with the skills of Dean Cundy as cinematographer, Arthur Schmidt as editor and hundreds of artists making all the animation** - this film stands out as nearly the final chapter on traditional animation***.Eisner and Roy E. Disney, vice chairman of The Walt Disney Company, felt the film was too sexual, but Zemeckis had final cut privileges (and Williams disliked Disney so much that he based his animation studio in England so they could not interfere). That's why this was a Touchstone Pictures release instead of Disney.Even today, Zemeckis claims that Disney will never make any of the proposed sequels, telling Den of Geek, \"The current corporate Disney culture has no interest in Roger, and they certainly don't like Jessica at all.\" He also claimed that a sequel**** wouldn't be on Disney+ as there are no princesses in it. There were, however, some animated shorts that came out after the film: Tummy Trouble proceeded Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Roller Coaster Rabbit played before Dick Tracy and Trail Mix-Up was in front of A Far Off Place.Instead of a detailed summary of the plot of this film, I suggest you view it for yourself. However, I will share that I absolutely love Joanna Cassidy as Eddie's strong and capable love Dolores and Christopher Lloyd is beyond outstanding as Judge Doom. And I think it's amazing that early versions of the script had The Toon Patrol weasels as Stupid, Smart Ass, Greasy, Wheezy and Psycho, created to be inversions of Snow White's Seven Dwarves Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey).Charles Fleischer was so dedicated to his role as Roger that he dressed up on set and did his lines. And man, has any voice ever been better for a cartoon noir girl than Kathleen Turner (and Amy Irving for the singing voice)? And any movie where a cartoon baby gruffly says, \"I got a thirty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinky...\"One last fact: When Eddie takes Roger Rabbit into the back room at the bar and Dolores is sawing their handcuffs, the lamp on the ceiling bumps and swings. That's all animation that was added to give the scene something extra. All of those shadows were drawn. That's why the phrase \"bump the lamp\" is used at Disney even today when people say they need to go the extra mile to make something special, even if no one notices it.*Test footage has Peter Renaday as Eddie Valiant, Paul Reubens as Roger Rabbit and Russi Taylor as Jessica Rabbit. Other actors who were almost Eddie include Harrison Ford, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams, Ed Harris, Charles Grodin, Robert Redford, Jack Nicholson, Sylvester Stallone, Wallace Shawn and Don Lane.**Post-production lasted 14 months and all of the animation was made with cel art and optical tricks instead of CGI.***It's also the last time Mel Blanc would voice Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Tweety Bird, and Sylvester the Cat.****You have no idea how badly I want to see Roger Rabbit: The Toon Platoon, a movie where Roger would have entered World War II and met his real father, Bugs Bunny.",

            "content": "Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is hired to take some naughty pictures of Jessica Rabbit and Marvin Acme. Soon, Jessica's husband Roger is framed for murder and Eddie -- the same man who just worked against him -- must help Roger prove his innocence and save Toon Town from being bought up by devious capitalist interests.This film combines cartoons with live-action actors, which is both the appeal and the strength of the film. While some moments are less than perfect, for the most part the creators did a fine job of showing how two-dimensional characters would operate in a three-dimensional world. Terry Gilliam has likened the film to \"Howard the Duck\" and of course many today could compare the movie favorably with \"Cool World\".The acting is fine all around. Bob Hoskins is great, and all the supporting cast are believable as people in a 1947 film noir world. Many other actors were rumored to be wanted for the role of Valiant, but I have a hard time seeing anyone pull it off like Hoskins did (which, in turn, is now the role he is remembered for). The cartoons are also okay for the most part, though some are annoying. Unfortunately, the most annoying is Roger. If they had to make a new character for this story, why did he have to be so incredibly irritating? The subplot of the \"freeway\" is nice. While I would like to think that there was a message in there about how globalization or rampant consumerism is bad, I am thinking that was not really the point and this was perhaps more of a throw away joke. And I do not deny I appreciate gas stations, rapidly-prepared food and billboards as far as the eye can see.I also take issue with Valiant's drinking problem. We never really see the problem (he passes out once, but is probably just tired). Yet, comments about his alcoholism must happen ten or twelve times. Show us, do not tell us. And the \"toon killed my brother\" line is great, but it is used like four or five times and we do not need to be reminded. If this were actually a children's movie, maybe they need the help, but I do not think even they are that dumb or forgetful.If you do not see this one, you might be missing out. If nothing else, it is a landmark in animation and set a new standard for how cartoons should look. But if you are from the 1980s or 1990s generation, this is probably already a part of your childhood and you are going to want to see it again for the first time. Maybe it is not \"The Land Before Time\" or \"Titanic\", but it is one of the more memorable films you are going to see... Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse together on one screen.",

            "content": "The hints at Bogart and the winks towards classic film noirs are routinely expected - but \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" rises above this all, and becomes something more than just another \"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid\" (a funny paraody but not exactly memorable), by employing something never seen before in film noirs: What appear to be living, breathing cartoons. That's right, cartoons. Seamlessly inserted frame-by-frame into the film are actual cartoon characters who interact with humans like nothing you have ever seen before - the quality of animation and interaction far surpasses such role models as \"Mary Poppins\" or \"Songs of the South\" - this is some of the best quality in both cartoon, film noir, and family entertainment in years - and maybe even decades.Though modern CGI presents wonderous images on-screen, it can also prevent quality from reaching through the celluloid - the feeling that what you are seeing has not just been splashed together messily, but has been shown unmistakable, painstakingly tiresome attention, detail and respect. Something like \"The Matrix,\" though visually dazzling, could never be done as well in cartoon format (can you just imagine Keanu Reeves soaring through the air fully animated?), and something like the animation in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" though visually dazzling, could never be used in a film like \"The Matrix.\"Sometimes CGI can make one feel as if the process of getting what you are witnessing on the screen onto the screen was too easy for the filmmakers. How often did you step back from something like \"Bulletproof Monk\" and admire its beauty and magnificence? Something like the animation in \"Roger Rabbit\" has quality, you can feel it, it almost invigorates you. Every single frame of this film had to be edited, and cartoonists had to draw in cartoon characters by hand. 82,000 frames of video in \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" were shown adamant attention - can you say the same thing about \"The Lord of the Rings\"?\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" went through about forty different script drafts, its villain once had a pet parrot named Vultar, and the five weasels seen at various points in the film used to be seven, named Greasy, Sleazy, Weazy, Smartguy (originally Smarta$$), Slimy, and so on. But it doesn't really show - there don't seem to be many flaws. Technically there are little, and plotwise there are little. It is a well-rounded film.The plot may be pointless to indulge in, but here we go. After an amusing setup involving a cartoon, the audience is suddenly thrown into a new reality so suddenly you almost have to do a double take. We are left aghast, shown an alternate Hollywood in 1947 - one alive with cartoons, or \"toons,\" as everyone in the film calls them. (After all, don't we make nicknames for races? Whites, blacks? Wouldn't the same be appropriate for cartoon characters if you had to repeat their species or race over and over as part of a daily routine?)In this alternate Hollywood, the cartoons have their own little place to live appropriately titled Toontown. It is the type of place where Walt Disney would have felt at home, as this alternate world leaps off the screen with comic liveliness and joy. But some of these toon inhabitants of Toontown have broadened out, leaving and going to work for Hollywood (one character in the film says, \"That Goofy is a genius!\").\nMaroon Cartoons is a big business in this alternate Hollywood, producing Baby Herman cartoons that co-star the jittery Roger Rabbit, perfectly and comically voiced by Charles Fleischer. Roger is a 100% toon. After being handcuffed to a gruff detective named Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) and after Roger is then dragged to an area where Valiant can remove the cuffs with a saw, Valiant tells Roger to sit still, and so Roger squeezes out of the coughs. \"You mean you could have done that all along?\" asks Eddie. \"No!\" says Roger. \"Only when it's funny!\"Parts of what make \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" tick so in-tune, with perfect harmony, is that it is never obnoxious - Roger is not a stupid comic sidekick. He's a lovable cartoon character that could - and almost did - spin off an entire franchise based upon him. British Bob Hoskins fakes a great American accent. Director Robert Zemeckis (\"Back to the Future\") gives a great film noir approach to the film. The animation is perfectly seamless. And the movie is funny.One of the things that struck me with wonder upon watching \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (along with the splendid animation and acting and direction and film noir), was that various competing cartoon characters were used in the film. In a shadowy bar Daffy Duck and Donald Duck perform a violent piano duel; soaring through the air with parashoots are Disney and Warner Bros.' most famous characters, Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny. And get this - not only are they in the same film, or even in the same frame together, but they talk to each other. How amazing is that? We will probably never witness competing cartoon characters, from a broad range of years, in the same film with each other ever again. I've never quite seen anything like \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" and we probably never will again.5/5 stars -John Ulmer",

            "content": "Roger Rabbit is a marvel, especially considering when it was made. Since 1988, there have been other films combining animation and live action (think: Cool World, Space Jam, and similar crap) but none of them have matched the quality of Roger Rabbit despite the fact that it preceded them by years and was made without the benefit of computer graphics. I'm not just referring to its almost seamless blend of Toon Town and The Real World, either--though certainly, the artistry of Roger Rabbit still manages to outshine its various clones by far. The plot, characters, and screen writing are perfect, hilarious, and a lot of fun.Bob Hoskins is amazing--I love the husky voice and accent he's adopted--and Joanna Cassidy, who plays Dolores, is rarely praised as she should be, it seems. Charles Fleischer, as the voice of Roger Rabbit (and a few other characters!) is perfect, too. He's an incredibly talented voice actor and this fact is more than obvious here.I also want to mention how much I like the lovely, melancholy soundtrack of this film.I loved this movie when it came out--I was just out of kindergarten--and I love it now. One of the many things that are so wonderful about Who Framed Roger Rabbit is its accessibility. It's full of innuendo and adult humor, but the characters are so much fun that viewers of any age should enjoy watching.",

However, not long after the incriminating photos are shown to Roger, Stubby just happens to die a violent death-and everybody suspects it was Roger who did it. Everyone that is, except Jessica who tells Eddie that the entire affair was a setup and that she isn't a bad person but that she was simply \"drawn that way\". Although not totally convinced that Jessica is as innocent as she claims, something doesn't seem quite right to Eddie and as a result he decides investigate a little deeper. But what he doesn't realize is just how dangerous his quest for the truth will eventually become. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very imaginative picture which made excellent use of portraying real actors next to a host of cartoon characters. Very imaginative indeed. Likewise, there is also a certain amount of mystery mixed in with the cartoonish atmosphere as well.

            "content": "Robert Zemeckis' fifth feature movie at the heel of the phenomenal BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985), WHO FRAMED RABBIT ROGER is an enormously entertaining amalgamation of live-action and traditional 2D animation, unprecedentedly assembles a plethora of cartoon characters from both Disney and Warner Bros. stocks. A none-too-mind-boggling whodunit in 1940s Hollywood where human society co-exists with a toon world. Rabbit Roger (voiced by Fleischer) is a name toon star who is framed for the murder of Marvin Acme (Kaye, in his silver-screen swan song), the mogul of Acme Corporation, and a human private eye Eddie Valiant (Hoskins), whose past tragic brush with the toon world still rankles, is dragged into the scramble to shake thing up, scupper a deleterious scheme of the evil Judge Doom's (Lloyd), settle the old score and finally he and Rabbit Roger establish a mutually respected bond between humans and toons. Decades later, the picture still looks pristinely stunning, a seamless coalescence of the 3- dimensional real world with the 2-D fantasy inspires great immediacy and fun, in both scenarios where Eddie is thrown into the toon-land or the other way around, toons wandering in the Hollywood lot or engaging a car-chasing in the street of L.A.. A petulant Hoskins is quite gung-ho in acting in front of a green-screen, and Lloyd is a palatable villain with cardboard identity and a cunning plan which is too prescient to be sardonic. A shrewd revelation of the villain is the victims' very own kind, would spawn different reactions from various projects, on the negative side, Frank Oz's god-awful THE STEPFORD WIFE (2004) brings to mind, but here, it can easily bypass any unwarranted hard feelings as who gives a fig about what a fruitcake toon thinks. The main cartoon characters are tailor-made to defer to the lowest common denominator - a kid's talkie, Rabbit Roger comes off as irritably garrulous, and his pleading of \"toons are made to bring laughter\" rings hollow since it fails to connect with today's reality, as we have been constantly assured and re-assured that animated works can do a whole lot more than cheap pratfalls and belabored jokes; the overtly risqu\u00e9 image of his wife Jessica (voiced by an uncredited Kathleen Turner) shows the industry really doesn't mind pigeonholing female characters into wishful- thinking love interests with inherent crassness, which is also confirmed by the one-note girlfriend role from Joanna Cassidy. On a larger scale, the movie's overwhelming success has at least partially sparkled a rekindled mass appreciation of the studio animation, which in the decades to come, has been prevailing over the global market henceforth, a throwaway question mark arises, nevertheless, how come a sure- fire sequel has yet to be green-lit regarding that the innovation in the animation department has already gone through a sea change, certainly, its appeal would exceed those live action performance-capturing ventures Zemeckis has consistently but unfruitfully experimented thrice in THE POLAR EXPRESS (2004), BEOWULF (2007) and A Christmas CAROL (2009).",

            "content": "Robert Zemeckis' \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is an enchanting masterpiece celebrating the triumph of film-making, with a level of quality in the same vein of groundbreaking cinematic treasures such as \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" or \"Toy Story\", combining animation and live action with a perfect and delightful realism.I can't decently talk about the film without paying tribute to the men and women who accomplished this. Consider that each frame implies the use of 24 images per second, and multiply this by the film's length, then think about all the parameters, like the perspectives that influence the size of the animated characters, the light and shadows for the choice of colors, the way the actors must pretend to physically interact with non-existent characters, grabbing them, shaking their heads or having their cheeks pinched by them \u0085 and all that stuff without the providential assistance of CGI, totally hand drawn from A to Z, in a total respect toward the same kind of dedication that conducted the hands of the ancient cartoon film-makers, the result is the ultimate proof that perfectionism always pays. There are \"Mary Poppins\" and \"Space Jam\", but \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is a class on its own and 'special' is too weak a word to define the effects, they are simply magical.I'm so glad I was a kid when I discovered it, I still remember how mesmerized I was by the introducing cartoon, something that resurrected the spirit of the Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry, Walt Disney or Tex Avery's cartoons, this universe that vibrates a sensitive chord in everyone's hearts. If you're a kid you love it, if you're an adult, it awakens the inner kid who saw these cartoons on TV, and if you're even older, it will get you back to the good old days when you saw them on the movie theater. Roger Rabbit, even as an original goofy, bubbling, creation, is the living allegory of this Golden Age combining many characteristics from Bugs Bunny, Screwy Squirrel, Tom the car with a certain Disney-like innocence, and after having been burnt, electrocuted, blown, and hit by a fridge, the film introduces, through an unforgettable plot twist, the co-existence between toons and humans in the real world. And the transition to this universe seems so natural that the surprise ceases immediately when we start following the hero of the film, Bob Hoskins as Eddie Valiant.And the choice of Bob Hoskins to play the sourpuss, no-nonsense, private eye, is a stroke of genius, as he perfectly conveys the everyday feel of the noir genre hero with a hard-to-conceal wound in his heart. In that zany and crazy world when you can encounter a clumsy mail-pelican riding a bike, a baby with a 50-year old man lust, giggling weasels or a crazy octopus serving drinks in a bar, Eddie evolves with an unshakable seriousness, highlighting its ordinary aspect, which is a great gag by itself. We would all love to go to Toontown but Eddie doesn't and this reluctance leads to a rewarding sequence when he finally gets into the town for an extraordinary moment, where a serious man suddenly lives under the cartoon's Law of Physicals. If Bob Hoskins played his part in a cartoonish way, this part wouldn't have been as exhilarating. Eddie Valiant is the perfect straight man of the comedic duo formed with Roger Rabbit, two opposite characters who'd go as far as getting handcuffed together.The handcuff even contributes to the most hilarious moment, when Roger easily gets his hand off after the danger is over and justifies that he couldn't have done it earlier unless it was funny. And the timing he chose was perfect! Roger Rabbit's philosophy of life, defines the whole purpose of cartoons, it's all about laughing and smiling. No wonder that the Cartoons' Golden Age coincided with the Great Depression era and World War II, when people needed to laugh, and when laughs were the perfect weapon to handle the harshness of life. And if Roger Rabbit could get a wife like Jessica because he made her laugh, well, it says everything about humor's value. And Jessica Rabbit as the sensual and voluptuous creature, proves that there are no limits for seduction, and I wonder how many men would rather have a creature 'drawn that way' than a real woman in flesh and blood. And if not the best character, she certainly makes the most spectacular entrance when she emerges from that curtain.And the beauty of \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is that the special effects always serve the purpose of the story. The film didn't forget to have a plot with its share of thrills, laughs, and even some dramatic moments you wouldn't expect. Honourable mention to Christopher Lloyd who proves again his unique talent to portray bizarre characters with an extreme convincingness, his portrayal of the sinister Judge Doom, makes him the perfect villain for such a creative film, hell, can you make a crueler villain than one who found a way to kill toons? and one of the most sadistic acts ever that would make my heart squeak of sadness.And the soul of the story is Eddie Valiant's reconquest of his lost sense of humor, a quest incarnated by one of the most immortal shots of the film, the last kiss between Eddie and Roger. And if I had to find an extra meaning to this kiss, it would be the expression of this profound love we have for these cartoons that enriched our childhood, and stood the test time, never losing their unique charm and universal appeal. And if only for having featured the two icons, Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse in the same frame, and the two greatest ducks in an unforgettable piano duet, the movie deserves the title of Best Picture of 1988.That's all, Folks!",

The craftsmanship in blending live action with animated characters is superb, but the movie has little else to offer.  Of course, I was a little kid at the time of the movie's release, and I think what impressed my easily-amused mind the most was the atmosphere of real-life fantasy the filmmakers had created--not the story.  Upon a recent viewing of WFRR, I found myself generally unimpressed with it, and often just bored with what was happening on-screen.  Meticulous attention to technical detail can only drive a movie so far before the viewer gets suspicious of its other attributes.  The humor is often loud and forced, and some scenes are so melodramatic and sappy you could pour them on your pancakes.  The plot plays out like \"Chinatown Lite\" and finds a good (if exaggerated) villain in Christopher Lloyd's Judge Doom. But \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" will always be remembered for its attention to technical detail, not its plot.  And I can't complain about its craftsmanship--living in an era where digital computer graphics have rendered film animation a simple, even lazy task, it's refreshing to see something that obviously took a lot of effort to put together.  \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" is more a pop-culture artifact that a seamless cinematic masterpiece, which is a shame considering its potential.4/10",

            "content": "For anyone who grew up watching cartoons (I can't imagine anyone who didn't!), this movie is perfect for you!  If anything, it is just amazing to see the unprecedented collaboration between Disney, Warner Brothers, and Tex Avery.  Like the geek I am, I squealed with delight when Donald and Daffy duked it out in a piano duel and when I saw the memorable skydiving scene with Mickey and Bugs.  It was also fantastic to see other animation legends, like Droopy and Betty Boop.I enjoyed this movie a lot when I was a kid (even though the villain, Judge Doom, scared me a little).  As for the adult jokes and innuendoes, they just flew over my head at that time.  I just laughed at the baby because he smoked and talked like an adult.  Only until I watch it now that I'm delightfully shocked at the adult humor involved.  It is a movie that appeals to the older set with its classic characters and modern humor, but kids can still enjoy it by seeing some of their favorite characters.As for the work that went into this movie, I just find it amazing.  Bob Hoskins, in particular, deserved an Oscar just for the degree of difficulty he took in the role of Eddie Valiant.  Not only did he have to disguise his thick British accent, but also he had to act with invisible characters and make it all look realistic.  And what a job he did!  As a viewer, you are immersed in this world where people and toons come together.  You get so caught up in the storyline and the characters that you don't really take a step back and think that this is just impossible.The actors, the puppeteers, the animators, the directors, and countless other staff members just did a phenomenal job with this movie.  It is truly one-of-a-kind, and I don't think we'll see anything quite like this again. Sure, there's been \"Space Jam\" and \"Looney Tunes: Back in Action,\" but I don't think those movies come close to the innovation and memorable storytelling that \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" achieved.  Kudos to everyone involved in this picture.  Hopefully someday they can all get together again.  I think I speak for many people when I say that we're eager to go back to Toontown!My IMDb Rating: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A+ (Oscar-Worthy)",

            "content": "Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a live action animated movie directed by Robert Zemeckis. The film takes place in 1947 during the golden age of Hollywood. The film centers on alcoholic detective named Eddie Valiant, who is tasked to take pictures of Roger Rabbit's wife Jessica Rabbit, but soon becomes involved in a conspiracy. And what we have here is Maltese Falcon meets Looney Tunes. I know that the filmmakers were inspired by other neo-noir films, but as I noticed some similarities between the two. And it also doesn't feel like they were trying too hard to make it the next Maltese Falcon either, but instead borrow themes from the Maltese Falcon, and other neo-noir detective films and transform it into a family friendly film. If someone were to ask me what the definition of a live action animated film is, I will tell them to go watch this. This movie does a perfect job of blending live action with animation, without making it feel awkward or creepy at the same time. Robert Zemeckis chose to do hand drawn animation rather than computer animated because he wanted to make this feel more natural. Also at the time this was one of the most expensive films to make, but it shows that with hard work you can create a beautiful film. And this proves that not all animated movies have to be computer animated, which I feel is what animation is all about now. I wish that they were more animated films like this because there are so many animated styles out there that haven't had their turn to shine. I will say that my one little flaw would be the ending. Even though this is a terrific film, the ending to me felt a little rushed like they almost ran out of time. So in the end, I would say take a break from the current animated films, and instead enjoy a different animated film for everyone.",

            "content": "In this film, the iconic Roger Rabbit is charged with murder and will have to resort to a human detective who hates cartoons to prove his innocence. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Jeffrey Price, the film features performances by Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd, as well as the voices of Charles Fleischer and Lou Hirsch.This film did something that, until then, was extremely rare: put human actors interacting with animated characters. And this was done with quality and a welcome realism. I excused to say, I believe, that the cartoons are the strong dish of the film, as well as the countless comic situations they star in. Bob Haskins shone in his role, skillfully balancing a comic character who maintains, throughout most of the film, a serious and even grumpy attitude. Of course, his most angry phrases eventually turn him into something even funnier. Christopher Lloyd comes late but in excellent performance, as villain. Cold as ice, insensitive to no end, he gave life to a memorable character with personality traits worthy of a Nazi executioner. Among the cartoons, Roger Rabbit and his sculptural wife, Jessica, deserve all the highlight.This is a family film that will easily appeal to all ages. The bright colors of the cartoons are appealing, contrasting with the more serious environment of the \"real world\" and flesh and blood actors. The special, visual and sound effects are excellent. The costumes are good and help the public to locate the story around the forties. The soundtrack is good and the music sung by Jessica, a jazz classic \"Why don't You Do Right\", is memorable.",

            "content": "\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (1988), there are many movies out there where live action and animated characters interact with each other. But this movie hits it out of the park! Not only is it the best live action/animated movie, but it's one of my top 10 favorite family films of all-time. Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects and a perfect soundtrack. The story sounds simple when you first hear the concept, and as you know most movies are just recycled plot lines. That being said, the story was conceived and executed flawlessly. It took a typical every day detective story, and turned it up to 11. Take a brilliant concept, add unique characters along with a brilliant story, and you have a fantastic movie. The acting is stellar, every live action actor and voice actor perform their respectable characters perfectly. But the shining stars are Bob Hoskins as the main protagonist, Eddie Valiant and Christopher Lloyd as the main antagonist, Judge Doom. Bob Hoskins may be a British man, but he was able to do a perfect American accent. When I first saw this movie, I had no idea that he was British until I saw an interview video of him. That really blew my mind! He also had the mammoth task of pretending that he was interacting with various cartoon characters. Sometimes you see a movie like this one where live action actors and cartoons interact, but you can tell that they're not looking at them at all. But in this movie, the film makers, especially the actors went through the pain-staking process to really pretend the character(s) were actually there. Had some other actor besides Bob Hoskins played Eddie Valiant, it may not have worked. Christopher Lloyd is brilliant, as usual, playing the main villain. He also does a perfect job pretending that the cartoon characters were there. Judge Doom stands out as one of the greatest movie villains of all-time. Only Christopher Lloyd can portray such a villain with such a funny, cunning, yet sinister villain with ease. You can tell he, along with the rest of the actors is having the time of his life. The voice actors are phenomenal, Charles Fleischer is brilliant as the voice of Roger Rabbit. To really seal the deal with his performance, he actually wore a rabbit suit on set to add to the character personality! Kathleen Turner does great as Jessica Rabbit's speaking voice and Amy Irving does a great job as Jessica's singing voice. Mel Blanc, the voice acting king, is brilliant as usual as the Looney Tunes characters. Every live action actor and voice actor does a flawless job with their parts! The sets/locations are outstanding, it's like you took a trip back in time to the late 1940s, 1947 to be exact, in the setting of the film. As for the special effects, they are perfect and still hold up to this day. Before the production of this movie, the film makers thought bringing the concept to the screen would be impossible. But, with a lot of hard work and dedication, it turned out to be a outstanding and memorable piece of cinema. Finally, Alan Silvestri wrote and composed a phenomenal soundtrack to really tie this movie together. The \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" soundtrack is one of the most memorable in all of cinema, and Alan Silvestri is certainly another one of my top 10 favorite music composers. Just like fine wine, even though I don't drink, I'm just trying to make a reference here. This movie just gets better and better with age, and is without a shadow of a doubt, one of my favorite family films of all-time. It is truly a timeless film for any generation. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you have not seen \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" yet, what are you waiting for? Go see it, or the Toon Patrol will come and get you! Now let's end this review with a moment of silence for the late, but great, Bob Hoskins, Mae Questel, Stubby Kaye, and the one and only Mel Blanc. Thank you all for providing great entertainment and making the world of cinema that much better. May you all rest in peace. If you're looking for a perfect live action/animated movie, then this is the movie for you. Words cannot describe how much I adore this film, go watch it today if you haven't before. You won't regret it, I promise.",

The mystery and film noir aspects of the film are achieved very nicely, and Bob Hoskins is a wonderful choice of lead actor, nicely supported by a typically kooky Christopher Lloyd ranged against him.

As the film started, I thought I was seeing a ROGER RABBIT short as a warm-up to the main event. I don't remember ever seeing a Roger Rabbit cartoon when I was growing up, but I thought \"What the heck? Even if it's new, it should be pretty good.\" Well, about five minutes into this little short, a director yells, \"CUT!\" and this little cartoon character in diapers yells, \"WHAT THE HELL WAS WRONG WITH THAT TAKE!\" On first viewing, this was a little jarring, seeing this cartoon in diapers using rather racy language. On subsequent viewings, it was something innovative and a little cutting edge. This was the first cartoon I ever saw that was geared more toward adults.Animation with live action was nothing new, even in 1988, (SONG OF THE SOUTH, MARY POPPINS, AND PETE'S DRAGON anyone?) but the interaction between the cartoon characters and their live counterparts never looked so natural. Even in the more physical parts like when Baby Herman whacked his secretary on the fanny and Eddie grabbed Roger by the ears, dunked him in the sink, and slapped the handcuffs on him was pure genius. My hat's off to the actors and the film editors for this. It was very impressive. (Also the part where the gorilla bouncers threw Eddie out of the night club was very well done as well.) This movie told a good story as well and didn't just rely on gimmicks like a lot of films of this nature do. It was a standard noir detective story, very much like the time period it was set in. But I think this is the first time a toon was ever accused of murder. And Jessica was very sexy looking for a cartoon. How about Betty Boop being out of work because cartoons went to color? There are some really wonderful things in this movie.The video I got less than a year later was always a favorite whenever we had adult parties or sleepovers for kids. People of all ages loved this movie. And Bos Hoskins (hope I got that name right) did a wonderful job with his California accent. I would never have known he was British if I hadn't researched him on this site. And it's hard for me to think of Christopher Lloyd as anyone but eccentric but likable Doc Brown in BACK TO THE FUTURE. He did a great job playing mean old Judge Doom. A noir detective story mixed in with some wacky cartoon fun. A great little ride. 9.5 out of 10.",

Do you mind?It was set in 1941, yet you'll notice the appearance of one or two characters (notably Droopy) who were unknown at that time.  (Of course, \"unknown\" doesn't mean \"non-existent\".)  The Goofy cartoon we see in the cinema wasn't made until 1949.  (I looked it up: but I didn't have to look it up to know it was later than 1941.)  Jessica Rabbit was a good femme fatale caricature, but somehow just wasn't sexy.  And Roger Rabbit is (as subsequent shorts have shown) a terrible cartoon character - how he could possibly have sustained a career even without a scandal looming over his head is beyond me.Ah, well.  The film was MADE for nit-pickers, or at least for those people who eagerly watch for glimpses of the elusive toon life of 1941.  And creating a short cartoon leading character on demand, as many have said, just can't be done - especially when the art is dead.  Roger Rabbit somehow manages to transcend his limitations and become a good foil for this particular film.Look, it was great. The implications of the living toons were for the most part thought through clearly (contradictions neatly and brazenly ignored). The special effects were fantastic - among the best of all time, up there with \"2001\", \"Star Wars\", \"Jurassic Park\".  And who could turn down the duet between Daffy Duck and Donald Duck?  It clearly ought to have been longer. If need be they could have made time by cutting out the dutiful homage to Mickey Mouse (who had little more to live for in 1941) and Bugs Bunny (who was never very good).

Mixing cartoons never seen before together (the duel between Donald and Daffy remains an absolute classic to be rewound and seen again forever and ever), the movie must have made a handful of animators of both Disney and Warner Brothers jerk a few tears, as the biggest stars of american animation of the forty's appear on screen and receive a human treatment. This really fantastic point of view is the reason I scored it a 9: the film dreams out loud, and allows us to picture a situation: what if the toons were actors, who have feelings, emotions and problems just like regular people? In the centre of this question is the show-stealer Roger Rabbit, who emerges as one of the most engaging animation characters created. But the real treat is seeing Bob Hoskins, who, accomplishing something never before seen, shares most of his screen time with a character which doesn't exist except on post-production.

            "content": "This movie is a joy. It's a technical achievement, a wonderful callback to a lost era in Hollywood, and a great example of a genre that had fallen out of favor all while being thoroughly entertaining with enough broad appeal to be a big box office hit. This is Robert Zemeckis using his accumulated craft and knowledge of the medium and applying it to someone else's work with energy and intelligence without ever losing a sense of fun. A movie about humans and cartoons feels like it should be fluff, but the sheer entertainment value makes it something truly special.In a world where cartoons walk amongst us, it is post-war Los Angeles and private detective Eddie Valiant has been called into R.K. Maroon's office in Hollywood to take a job. Their star, Roger Rabbit, is having trouble with his performance, and the problem may be his wife, Jessica, cheating on him. Eddie is sent to take whatever pictures he can to prove the charge. As with most of Zemeckis' early work, one of the joys is the little details that get peppered throughout the beginning of the film that end up paying off later. Eddie's brother and their shared background as clowns and circus performers, conveyed through a single tracking shot that evokes not only Zemeckis' own Back to the Future but also Hitchcock's Rear Window and contains an imperceptible time jump, all comes back later, especially in the final moments of the movie. As Eddie takes the job, finds a camera to use, and goes to the exclusive nightclub, we get all of these little details, and they provide depth to the world and to Eddie's character at the same time.Well, Eddie finds Jessica in a compromising situation (literally playing patty-cake with Mr. Acme, the owner of the gag company just this side of Toon Town), and Roger goes missing. Acme ends up dead, and the mystery begins to unfold. Another great thing about this film is how the mystery evokes some of the great noir mysteries, especially Chinatown. It's a plot to eventually tear down Toon Town and replace it with a freeway. The clues are dropped throughout (pulled from real life in a certain way), and it ends up working as a noir mystery on its own. Replace Toon Town with the slums of LA or a section of town for a minority, and you could move the story wholesale into a more realistic setting without cartoon characters.The thing about the cartoon characters is that they work really well both as characters and as feeling like they exist in the same physical space as the human actors. They are largely defined by easily identifiable traits, like Roger being zany with little thought and Jessica being sexy but devoted to her husband, but they are not really the center of the film. That's Bob Hoskin's Eddie Valiant. Broken after the death of his brother at the hands of a toon as they chased down a lead on a bank robbery, he refuses to work for toons and has grown into a fair bit of a bigot against them. He has an arc that keeps him a hard-boiled detective but allows him the ability to empathize with these cartoon characters. Up against him is Judge Doom, played wonderfully by Christopher Lloyd, who is all menace and turns into quite the unique monster by the end.The success of the physicalness of the cartoon characters is mainly due to two people. The first is Zemeckis himself who brought all the technical innovations together in front of the camera to begin with. The second is Richard Williams, the director of the animation. Williams was an animator based in England who had mainly worked on commercials, but he got the job on Roger Rabbit because of his unfinished feature film The Thief and the Cobbler.Now, a quick second to talk about The Thief and the Cobbler. It has one of the longest production schedules in film history. Williams tried for literally decades to get it done, eventually getting $25 million to make it in the early 90s based on his work on Roger Rabbit. It was never completed by him, the bond company eventually taking away from him and finishing it with the title Arabian Knights. A fan put together the Re-Cobbled edition a few years ago, and while unfinished it's the work of a master who is in complete love of his art. The visuals are so beautiful that its simplistic story can get overlooked. His is a sad story because he never really recovered from the collapse of his production of his masterwork.Anyway, what Williams brought to Roger Rabbit was amazing ability from him and his team, but also an incredible ability to adapt to a new way of making animation. You see, Zemeckis didn't leave his camera stationary all that much. He loved to pan around in a space, and he wasn't going to stop just because it was going to be easier for the animators. So, using motion controlled cameras, he was able to film everything he wanted and Williams was able to find a way to keep the animated characters seemed fixed in a stationary location while the camera moved. On top of that, characters interact with the environment around them through animatronics that the animations hid, and it all looks so incredibly seamless.There's such multi-faceted fun to be had with Who Framed Roger Rabbit. From the technical performances to the narrative, this film is a joy to watch. Zemeckis took on a difficult job and made it seem almost effortless. Terry Gilliam actually turned down the offer to direct this simply because if felt like too much work. I'd be curious to see what Gilliam would have made of it, but what Zemeckis made was wonderful.",

Roger Rabbit becomes a suspect when he learns of his wife Jessica's affair with Acme. But who actually framed Roger Rabbit? Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a classic blend of live action animation combined with a real world motion picture and it's these aspects combined that make it so memorable (it was also very unique back in 1988). The audience are treated to a wonderful 5 minute cartoon at the start which was great for me as it harked back to my youth - it reminded of the wonderful cartoons from my youth. The story in itself plays as a murder mystery and this aspect alone is strong enough to make the film worth watching (even if it is a little bit predictable). Hoskins initially seems like an unsympathetic character, but my impression of him changed as the story unfolds - we do at least get an understanding of why he is the way that he is.The real stars of the show here are the animated characters and whenever Roger Rabbit is on the screen you're almost guaranteed a laugh. Fans of the 'cartoons of old' are guaranteed some fun here with various cartoon character cameos from the likes of Daffy Duck, Donald Duck, Yosemite Sam & Porky Pig just to name a few. The zany antics of the cartoon characters really do make this a fun and joyous experience. The scene in the lift with Droopy and Hoskins was simply genius. In this film we also get to see Jessica Rabbit who is arguably the sexiest cartoon creation in existence (even though it feels a bit weird saying this).The only minor criticism that I have with this film is that it does sag a bit in the middle, but it's never a major problem as those crazy Tooney characters are never far away and it is definitely they that give us the most laughs.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an excellent film that was quite a unique experience when it was released and it's a film that still holds up well today. The showdown between Lloyd and Hoskins at the end was also incredibly funny and was also quite imaginative as well. A great little film that is well worth checking out.FINAL NOTE; this film has a PG rating, but it's probably best not to let really young children watch this as it does have quite a dark plot and can be quite violent at times.",

Naturally Rog is the prime suspect but Valiant digs deeper and finds there is a lot more to the equation than a simple homicide.Melding animation with reality fluidly Rabbit takes off from the get go with high comic moments from end to end as both Looney, Disney and assorted other cartoon greats make appearances that will permanently imprint a smile on your face from beginning to end. In addition there are some wonderfully appropriate references to Chinatown mimicking not only scenes but also bureaucratic skulduggery with a basis in truth that plagued LA in the first half of the century.Bob Hoskins as the rumpled alcoholic gumshoe is fire plug sized perfect to ride around in talking taxi's and punch out cartoon characters with a frustrated cynicism.

On the animation side Roger is annoyingly and hilariously unable to put a cork in it. The buxom Jessica is a combination Lauren Bacall, Mae West who claims she's not bad, \"just drawn that way\". Then there are the dozens of cameo performances of animated greats populating the film that never allow you to catch your breath along with all sorts of cartoon gadgets that make you realize the kid in you never left. Who Framed Roger Rabbit deserves to be called a unique classic.",

But the eye-popping interaction between humans and toons has something for everybody: enough ingenuity to entertain adults, and plenty of color and noise to distract even those children unable to follow the serpentine, gum-shoe plot (a comic strip echo, believe or not, of Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown'). Hardboiled private eye Bob Hoskins has a tough time answering the title question because the toons obey their own peculiar physical laws, setting up a topsy-turvy conflict between reality and fantasy. Thankfully, the live actors play it straight, all except Christopher Lloyd as the obvious villain, revealed in the end to be (not surprisingly) a toon in disguise.When first released in June of 1988 (I saw it at a press screening, even earlier) the film was a timely reminder of what summer movies are supposed to be all about, offering brisk, clever pop entertainment, with a homeopathic (but worthwhile) moral: a laugh is better than a frown.",

I didn't like the new toons - the character and voice of Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleischer) was unappealing, and the giant boobs on Jessica Rabbit (Kathleen Turner) were too much. Something about it lacked the charm of the old cartoons, as if it was working too hard to get all the references and slapstick in.

By film critics, film buffs, the other user posters on IMDb and every other person who saw this one? But you know what? I'm not here to really promote this movie, or analyze it... I'm here to write my love letter for it. We're all here to share our movie-going experiences, aren't we? Well, f*ck it, here's mine.I still remember being a little prepubescent boy sitting in the theater watching this movie, totally amazed and astounded by what I saw. Seeing this wacky cartoons going through a routine Tom-and-Jerry-type episode... and then... it was amazing how these movie actually tricked you, convinced you to believe that human and cartoons can exist in the same universe and dimension of reality. There are many a great pleasures and moments in this movie, one of them is the duet at a \"toon\" night club called \"The Ink & Paint Club\" where Eddie goes to get information about Roger's wife, and the opening act is a dueling duet on the piano featuring two great legends, Daffy Duck and Donald Duck (I doubt there's any biological relation there) together at last. Why did it take so long for these two to get together? Well, they are rival entertainers for rival studios, so... But of course, the dueling duet ends in an all-out war. Come on, we both know the hatchet wasn't going to stay buried very long.The whole movie is worth renting just to see the two great legends, Daffy and Donald, put their differences aside for one memorable dueling piano duet ALONE. \"Roger Rabbit\" pioneered not only animation and film-making style, but acting, writing, directing and a meshing together of different genres. Imagination, luck, brilliance, skill... it's all been blended so perfectly here... just like the animation and live-action.Funny, sharp, satirical, smart, thrilling, skillful, bright, bold, hard-boiled, colorful... at even at times, a little scary.It one three Oscars, not to mention an Honorary Award for it's Technical Advancements. Hell, it deserved every single Oscar it got! And a few it didn't. It should've won every single Oscar that year. Maybe some from others...God, you know, I still remember finding my little Rescue Ranger toy in my pocket and running in back-and-forth through my fingers... I remember being very careful not to loose it as I watched this. And it was hard, damn it, all of what was going up there on the screen.There's the best of the everything here. Everyone should see it, pure and simple. It's a movie... for pretty much everybody. A masterpiece in more ways than one.So help me God, I cannot think of a better actor for the role of the classic, hard-boiled, rock-bottom, not-too-smooth P.I. than Bob Hoskins. I don't think he's ever played a better role in his whole life. He seems to be a strange collision of Sam Spade and W.C. Fields, in some strange way.Christopher Lloyd proves yet again (as he does in all his roles) that he's one of the most underrated actors in the business. He's known for playing the bizarre, the crazy, the wired. But his ability to play villains, particularly more sedate and low-key ones, is overlooked so much, it's grounds for a discrimination lawsuit.Kathleen Turner is damn perfect as Roger's Mrs; especially considering that all she does here is a voice.Roger Rabbit\" pioneered not only animation and film-making style, but acting, writing, directing and a meshing together of different genres. Literature purists and scholars (yes, I mean geeks) will note that this movie is adapted from a novel by Gary K. Wolf, who specializes in science-fiction. For those of you who are enamored with this movie and just learning this, are actively considering dropping this review right this instant and running to your nearest library and bookstore to pick up a copy to read as an addition to the movie or just out of curiosity, I should warn you that the movie is completely unfaithful to the novel. Oh, both are clever and well-written spoofs of the whole \"hard-boiled private-detective mystery noir genre,\" but the two are so completely different, in writing-style, character dialouge, plot, theme, even ending, you wonder why they even bothered to get Wolf's permission and pay him a royalty. Gee, usually these Hollywood types are a little more snaky and know how to exploit all these loopholes.You've no doubt heard the old saying, \"You can't please everyone, so don't even bother.\" Because when you try, you wind up ultimately pleasing no one. Least of all, yourself. It's strange, this movie seems like an exception to that one little rule. I mean, I know there's an exception to every rule, but this is one you're sure is completely iron-clad. This is a movie for everyone. This is a movie that will please everyone. And you know what else? It never got the credit for that. Think about what a big train-wreck this movie could have been. How many things could have gone wrong. How many years Disney and Warner have been at war, all this time, money for a experiment that could have gone worse than than the killer bees and the atomic bomb. And yet, glory be, it didn't. We all live for days like this, filmmakers, film critics... and film lovers. The best part? After it was all over... Roger and Baby Herman went on to star in several of their own cartoon shorts before the movie for real (\"Dick Tracy\" and \"Honey, I Shrunk The Kids\"). Good for them.--In Honor of Roger And His Pals, Dane Youssef",

            "content": "It is a little known bit of trivia that, in the early 20th century, General Motors, Standard Oil and Firestone Tires allegedly formed the National City Lines holding company in order to purchase and then dismantle streetcar systems, replacing them with buses and increase the publics reliance on automobiles. Somehow, this tid-bit became the genesis of a movie which was a run away success at the box office, is still widely regarded as the best of its kind and created a renaissance in the way cartoons were made. It's all a little loony.Who Framed Roger Rabit follows the story of Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), a washed up P.I, and Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleischer), a cartoon rabbit. Obviously. Roger, framed for the murder of Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye) goes to Eddie for help because, as the Rabbit says, \"Everyone knows that when a toon's in trouble, there's only one place to go: Valiant & Valiant.\" Unfortunately there is one Valiant too many in that sentence, Eddie's brother having been killed by a toon a few years ago. So Eddie, once a happy chap, can no longer stand toons. But like so many heroes in the past his sense of morality will not let him watch an innocent rabbit take the fall, and so he and Roger set out to find out who killed Acme, as well as locate his missing will. Along the way they meet a foul-mouthed, cigar-smoking baby (Lou Hirsch), a smart-talking taxi-cab (also voiced by Fleischer) and Rogers femme fatale wife, Jessica (voiced by an uncredited Kathleen Turner). They also manage to bump into almost every animated star from the first half of the 20th century. The finale sees Eddie taking on Roger's hunters; Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) and his goons. We learn that Doom is actually the toon responsible for the death of Eddie's brother, but it's OK, because he dies in a particularly gruesome way in the end.It boggles the mind just how much love and attention must have gone into the making of this movie. It has constant references to other cartoons (a Tex Avery style opening, citizens of Toontown singing 'Smile, Darn You, Smile'), references to classic movies (an invisible rabbit called 'Harvey', a Maltese Falcon hatstand) as well as a brain-melting number of cameos throughout the movie. This coupled with a huge number of in jokes - my favourite being a sign saying \"Porkys: All Beef Sausages\" - and you have a movie that has so many hidden gems that you could watch it a hundred times and still not have seen everything. Yet just because it is a cartoon fan-boy's dream that does not mean it is actually any good.Luckily the quality of the animation, acting, script and direction DO mean it is good. This is the movie that finally took the crown of best combination of live action and animation from the head of Mary Poppins.. The effects are superb, each shot is one of pure quality. Lakfjsoasjfoasj doesn't cheat either, the camera constantly moves, changing the perspective of the animated characters, yet they still hold up perfectly. The live action characters are also a joy. Hoskins plays the part of the gumshoe perfectly, and his cartoonish movements and actions at the end of the film are superb. Lloyd has a field day. An actor who very few would ever accuse of being unafraid to go over the top, here he gets to actually play a live action cartoon, and every moment he is on screen is wonderful. Joanna Cassidy, as Hoskins' love interest Doloris is also fantastic, getting to play the kind of smart talking character made so famous by Mae West all those years ago.Yet the real stars all all of the characters we love from our childhood. Here on screen are creations from Disney, Warner Brothers and MGM. Highlights for me include the fantastic Donald and Daffy duelling pianos scene, Droopy Dog, whom I adore, and Mae Questel actually voicing Betty Boop. Even as a child in the cinema I was so happy to see both the Warner Brothers ending (Tha-tha-tha-tha that's all folks!) and the Disney Ending (Tinker Bell the fairy) together on screen.A movie that can appeal to all members of the family, except possiably late teens who take themselves FAR too seriously (an original screen test of 18-19 year olds saw most of the audience walk out) this is a truly masterful film, and one that is yet to be bettered despite todays far superior technology.",

This film plays with the film noir genre to the best possible and self-aware degree whilst taking its morality of truth prevailing in the end VERY seriously.

This very fact made it hard for me to enjoy this well-crafted film-noir. But even if the film had received an appropriate rating, nothing would excuse its divergence from the supposed nature of cartoons in the film. The 'toons' are supposed to exist to make people laugh, but character Jessica Rabbit has grotesque features very much aimed toward her sexual parts, like she was conceived from some beyond help geekoid. Sure I remember the hilarious \"Little Red Riding Hood\" shorts that involved a very frisky wolf, but Rabbit's character was emphasized so disturbingly beyond her importance as the femme fatale in this mock film-noir. I wasn't laughing. Still, there are very clever homages to the nature of 'toons' (and underlying tones that allude to racism and genocide) that make the film work. The toons are blended so realistically into the story, technically and thematically, that I will praise it for such. Loopy cartoons and 1940's film noir should be wholly analogous to each other, but here they work to a level that makes it feel like this genre has always existed. This idea does much favor to the film's aesthetic appeal, and the animation appears to be computer animated with its use of shadow, despite the dark tone coloring. It was certainly a technical achievement. I'm sure the film inspired future efforts of the odd mixing of defined groups of entertainment, \"Happy Feet\", \"Space Jam\" and \"Shrek\" all come to mind, the latter being one of the better films in my opinion.

            "content": "Over the span of 30 years, Who Framed Roger Rabbit has been lauded for its technical innovations, admirable tongue-in-cheek tribute to cartoons from the Golden Age of American Animation and classic film noir, and just being a fantastic film in every regard. What was originally a book by the name of Who Censored Roger Rabbit went through roughly seven years of development before finally reaching the big screen in the summer of 1988. Since then, the movie would become arguably one of the most influential films of all time, and would also help launch the animation renaissance of the 1990s next to The Little Mermaid and Ren & Stimpy. As for me, considering that this is my all time favorite movie, you can bet I have much to say about it.Set in Hollywood around 1947, where cartoon characters exist in the real world, cartoon star Roger Rabbit is accused of murdering owner of Toontown, Marvin Acme. This was the result of alcoholic private eye Eddie Valiant getting hired by cartoon producer R.K. Maroon to investigate adultery involving Roger's wife Jessica and Acme. Now Roger tries to get Eddie to clear his name from the villainous Judge Doom who vows to destroy him and all other toons. While that plot does sound wacky in concept, it nonetheless adds in to the film's tone, as the whole film is a passionate love letter to the style and humor of cartoons from the 1940s. The very first scene is a Roger Rabbit/Baby Herman cartoon entitled Somethin's Cookin', which is a rapidly paced homage to the zany cartoons of Tex Avery and Hanna-Barbera. Of course the other pairing of toons themselves are memorably hilarious, especially that famous Daffy Duck and Donald Duck piano duel, but the film always keeps on its toes to make sure the main story doesn't get out of focus.In terms of the film noir aspect, the general story is executed as one big crime case that has much more hidden underneath it as Eddie unravels more clues. Admittedly, the plot can be a little complicated to follow at times, mainly due to the immense amount of details once everything is revealed, although it does make much more sense upon repeat viewings. Nonetheless, the buildup further creates the necessary suspense and thrills to figure out who exactly is behind the cartoon murder case. It's with all of these elements that help recreate the original book's mystery angle while condensing it a bit to play around with the cartoony antics and fast paced comedy. It's debatable whether or not the filmmakers studied any particular film noir classics, but the film's point of view as a thriller is so well put together that it's hard to believe that wasn't the case.As for the characters, Eddie Valiant may start off grouchy, but it's through his backstory that explains his inner struggles with toons, and Bob Hoskins portrays his down-to-earth persona up to the point where one could also relate to something they love ruining their life. Charles Fleischer pulls off Roger's voice, and while some could find it annoying, he manages to carry Roger's emotions in context to the human actors astonishingly while making him delightfully amusing. Jessica Rabbit could pretty much be called the spiritual successor to Tex Avery's Red Hot Riding Hood, mainly from her bombshell design and scarlet attire, but she's also a very devoted wife to Roger, showing how sometimes a human and a rabbit being married ain't so bad after all. Lastly, Judge Doom may seem like a subdued psychopath at first, but his plan to wipe out all toons is so diabolical that his reveal sums up his whole character. While there are other fun characters like the weasels, Dolores, Benny the cab and Baby Herman, they're not quite as developed as the rest, but they do their jobs well as supporting characters. What's interesting to mention is a subtle social commentary on how the toons are depicted. Similar to the book, the toons are depicted as minorities, since real people don't really interact much with them outside of working in Hollywood, unlike that of Eddie and friends or Judge Doom and his weasels. Not to mention, the scene where Roger tells Eddie how laughter can be a very powerful thing while standing on a soap box is rather symbolic of African Americans standing up for their own rights. In fact, ToonTown is essentially a ghetto since only toons live there far off from the people of the real world. Hell, Roger stated in the film, \"there's no justice for toons anymore,\" as if that statement was similar to how little justice there were for people of different races back then. It's when Judge Doom reveals his plans to turn ToonTown into a freeway where viewers may see the lovable toons in a completely different light. While these metaphors are more subtly played out, this really makes that legendary happy ending with all our favorite animated characters celebrating Marvin Acme's will surfacing their free rights a blessing in a way.I think Richard Williams was the perfect choice to direct the film's animation, as he and his crew managed to set up distinct rules in combining the toons with the real world. For example, when Roger crashes through R. K. Maroon's office, the hole he leaves behind looks just like him, and one scene shows Roger spitting out realistic water, not water drawn on paper. This is not only thanks to the highly talented animators, but also ILM who helped create a wonderful method of compositing the traditional animated characters into the same environments as the live actors without using advanced computers. The processes ranged from prop manipulation, to superimposing the frames on photostatic blowups, to multiple matte layers, and especially constant camera motion, showing just how painstaking the process must have been for the crew. In addition, Williams designed Roger based on features of characters born out of Warner Bros, MGM, and Disney. Considering how hard it is to make real people interacting with characters of another realm look convincing, the techniques worked so well that one could imagine the film's world being real.Of all the films that have combined live-action and animation, as well as being tributes to classic cartoons and crime thrillers, there may never be one that will even come close to topping this one. Who Framed Roger Rabbit still stands the test of time for its fantastic technical achievements, intriguing story with some hidden albeit smart depth and satire, lovable characters and charming imagination. At this point, there's no reason not to see this film again, as anybody who loves cartoons, film noir, or even highly creative movies in general will get a kick out of this now as much as the audiences of back then. And now, to end this off, time to quote the movie itself: \"Things are never black as they are painted, time for you and joy to get acquainted. So make life worthwhile; come on and smile, darn ya, smile.\"",

            "content": "On the Special Edition DVD of \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", one of the animators says he was talking to another animator in 1986, who told him, \"This movie is two years away and I'm scared right now.\" The guy confessed he was too. And frankly, I don't blame them one bit, considering this was the first film to combine live action with animation, and in the eighties of all decades. One false move, this could have been worse than Plan Nine From Outer Space. Thankfully, they got Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg behind this, who know how to make good, quality (and hit) films, and I don't think they could have made a better movie.Set in 1947 Hollywood, it deals with down-on-his-luck, hard-boiled private detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins, who does a great job, despite the fact that his British accent comes through once in a while) who is assigned by cartoon studio executive R.K. Maroon, to investigate Jessica Rabbit, the wife of one of his stars, Roger Rabbit, who is allegedly having an affair with the owner of Toontown, where all the cartoon characters (brand new and classic Disney ones) live, Marvin Acme. Valiant reluctantly accepts it because when he was younger, he and his brother Teddy, who lived to work in Toontown and help toons out, were on a case there and a toon dropped a safe on Teddy's head, killing him and leaving Eddie with a hopeless lack of sense of humor. Later, Roger is accused of murdering Marvin Acme over jealousy, and is sought by the eccentric Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd, who follows one eccentric Zemeckis role, Doc Brown, with this one), who wants to put him in his special dip which kills toons. Convinced Maroon made a patsy out of him, Eddie helps Roger prove his innocence, and in the process, it turns out that it is Judge Doom who not only killed Acme, but is also the Toon who killed his brother.Now, Roger Rabbit is none too bright, and anybody who's seen the movie can vouch for this, but he proclaims when he asks Eddie Valiant to help him that he could never hurt anybody, and that too, should be obvious to anybody who's ever seen the movie. I can remember seeing the movie when I was seven or eight in the theaters and saying, \"I never saw a cartoon talk to a person before.\" Which I'm sure everybody else thought too. But I can't recommend it enough for kids or adults because kids will love the enduring, lovable Roger and adults will appreciate the marvels of the movie, which were impossible before it, as well as appreciate how much hard work went into it.There was a book before this, Who Censored Roger Rabbit, in which they were comic strips not actors, it was set in present day and Roger and Jessica's marriage was fake like Bennifer. I also hear Roger wasn't as goofy in the book, so I prefer not to read it. Plus, he dies. Now, as lovable as Roger was in the film, if they'd killed him off in that, do you know how many angry parents would have written letters to the studio that they made their children cry? I love the movie, and that might ruin it for me.",

            "content": "if you don't know the password, i ain't gonna tell ya.for those of you who luv roger and know the password, you know what i'm talking bout.'Roger Rabbit' is one of Disney's best accomplishments and a true cinema classic that actually does make a certain amount of contribution to cinema technique and style.the combination of live action and hand drawn animation is hardly ever explored or done. there are endless experiments in CGI but very few utilizing this classic cinema technique. there are very few projects outside of Disney that do this. even Disney, who pioneered the technique, rarely used it outside of his television show and for theatrical features. aside from the amazing 'Three Caballeros', there are really only a handful of Disney classics using the process. 'Song of the South', 'Mary Poppins', 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks', and 'Pete's Dragon' are the only Disney films that use this process which is strange that there are so few because Disney pioneered it. Disney pretty much invented it with the early 'Alice' comedies which were earlier than the Fleischer 'KoKo' cartoons. and aside from 'Space Jam' and 'Bullwinkle', it's almost never done by anyone else.that's why 'Roger Rabbit' is such a interesting, and in my opinion, a truly pioneering Hollywood classic and a film that makes more contributions to cinema then it's usually given credit for.not to mention the brilliant performances which actually rival the astonishing technical aspect of the film. Bob Hoskins is incredible in this and should have been nominated for a Oscar. he probably should have won. Christopher Lloyd is terrifying and brilliantly villainous. in fact Lloyd's Judge is probably one of cinema's weirdest and scariest villains ever conceived. not much to say about Joanna Cassidy here except that she is one of those truly rare actresses who can absolutely do no wrong. like Hoskins and Lloyd, she is outstanding and wonderfully inspired in this and actually has one of the film's best lines, \"is he always this funny? or only on days when he's wanted for murder?\". let's also not forget the sheer hilarity of Charles Fleischer's Roger. not only is Fleischer's Roger one of the best voices in cartoon history, it is also one of the very best performances of our recent times. Fleischer's Roger is both deftly comical and endearingly lovable. Roger's neurosis and insecure behavior are very human and very relatable.this film is also very Disney. sure it was produced by Disney's Touchstone division and it featured many Warner Bros. character's as well as just about every nostalgic cartoon character from the golden age of cartoons. but it was animated mostly by Disney animators, and any film that has an appearance by Mickey Mouse and Tinkerbell, is pretty much a Disney experience since those character's never appear outside of Disney films and shows.this film also has Mickey Mouse and Bugsy Bunny appearing together for the first and only time. Mick and B.Bunny's screen time together is very brief probably because they were basically rivals. Mickey was always rather amiable and pleasant toward the Bunny, but Bugs was always rather critical and scornful of the congenial modest mouse. i always felt that the Bunny was secretly jealous of the mouse's sense of compassion and social abilities. i admire the Bunny very much as a comedian, but let's be realistic and honest, the Bunny is really a asocial personality type.'Roger rabbit' is one of my very favorite cinema fantasies. truly magical and inspired and a great technical achievement. for those people that don't really get Disney classics or 'Roger Rabbit', and still don't know the \"password\", maybe you should watch the film again, learn the password, think about it, and maybe then you might just understand and change your mind. this is a classic for true devotees.",

I watched it again even though I have a longstanding dislike of Robert Zemeckis' movies just because I enjoy Bob Hoskins and I like the idea behind the movie of mixing animation and live action in a period story. I thought maybe it would have aged well and that I might enjoy it more this time. So anyway rather than belabor the point let me just list a few of the things I liked and disliked and leave it at that. Start with the bad news, eh? I disliked Christopher Lloyd as the villain\u0085 in fact I always dislike Lloyd when he plays a villain. Who keeps casting him this way? He's not scary and it robs him of the chance to be funny. Probably Zemeckis just wanted him in the movie because he was so popular in \"Back 2 the Future.\" Sorry to Charles Fleischer because I've heard he's a great guy, but I have never cared for his voice work as Roger in this movie and basically the animation doesn't blow me away either. I never understood why they had a rabbit in this movie instead of making up a more original animation because it always felt like a retread of Bugs Bunny to me.There's not much of a plot or a mystery here either, considering how much screen time was devoted to it.OK, I do like some of the cameos by classic animated stars from \"Bugs\" to Betty Boop. I liked when Hoskins first rode into Toontown, or maybe it was the second time, and was greeted by all the smiling animals and the smiling sun. Very strange. Bob Hoskins was fine in the role. Joanna Cassidy is a favorite of mine, with some of the most gorgeous shoulders ever seen on the silver screen and a great personality to match. Sad to report though in this film she doesn't really get to do anything memorable.It's probably more to fun to watch for people who are more into classic animation than I am. Basically I've just always felt that it's a gimmicky film and that it really doesn't have much heart and soul.",

It was a scream. Bu then the rest of the film takes over, an d after the first few minutes of being amazed at the technical slight of hand...it begins to go downhill. By two-thirds of the way through, I was barely paying attention any more. The only thing that kept me awake was trying to see how many different cartoon characters I could recognize and remember where they came from originally.So all in all, I couldn't find myself capable of giving it more than a 5... if I were voting on the first 5 minutes I would have given it a 9; if I were voting just on technical merit i would give it a 10... but as a whole?

I appreciate the creativity and imagination involved, but there are several things about the film that have always bugged me.Firstly, and most importantly, Roger himself: I really dislike his voice and mannerisms - he should have been loveable, but instead he's thoroughly irritating. When much of the film revolves around such an obnoxious character, we're not off to a good start.Secondly, the animation: it's clever the way it is integrated into real-life (although not as ground-breaking as it is claimed to be - remember Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks?), but I hate the soft shading used to give a supposedly realistic 3D effect; I'd much prefer simpler cel shading or none at all.Bob Hoskins always seemed to me like a strange choice: he doesn't suit the role of a tough, hard-drinking noir-style detective. He's too short and pudgy.The plot is kinda dull: some tommyrot about a missing will, real estate deals and a plan to build a freeway. Yawn.And the run-time of 104 minutes is unnecessarily long.On the plus side, Christopher Lloyd is great as villain Judge Doom (scary enough to give young kids bad dreams), Joanna Cassidy as Eddie's love interest is yummy, there are some fun cameos from classic cartoon characters, and the final fight that makes use of lots of Acme products is inventive.On the whole, I find the film to be passable entertainment, but it's not one that I like to revisit all that often.",

For the first time, human characters and cartoon characters were able to share the screen together and look real. Compared to today, the visuals may not seem impressive. But back then, this was unheard of and a risky move that paid off. As for the story, this film has a heart, is funny, full of one-liners, and is one the entire family can enjoy.Robert Zemeckis film is about how a toon-hating detective was hired to investigate an affair that Roger Rabbit's wife, Jessica was having with Marvin Acme. But after Acme was found dead, Roger was accused of murdering him. But after Roger pleas to the detective, he uncovers scandal after scandal.The acting is pretty good for the most part and I'm sure it was challenging to play these roles. Bob Hoskins does a wonderful job as the detective. But even better as the Judge was the menacing Christopher Lloyd. I think he managed to give every kid who saw this film nightmares for weeks.Overall, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a break-through movie of the 80's and a family film that has a big heart. It was nice seeing some great cameos from the likes of Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck. If there is a film to bring back some childhood memories, this is the film to watch.

There is still one problem, Eddy isn't that found of toons.Blending the darker aspects of film noir with the humor of cartoons isn't an easy task, but this movie succeeds very well. Bob Hoskins does a great job as Eddy Valiant, especially since most of his costars aren't real. And Christopher Lloyd plays one of the most scary villains yet seen in cinema.For old cartoon fans like myself there are a lot to be happy for. A lot of our old favorites shows up. The most hilarious, and in my opinion funniest, part is the piano duel between Donald and Daffy Duck. But other characters will show up their well known faces, too.

That is the magical world of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, a remarkable movie, not only in the visual achievement of the film, but also it stars both Disney and Looney Toon characters. Produced by Steven Spielberg, rights owned by Buena Vista (part of the Disney empire), and directed by Robert Zemeckis, there is a lot of talent involved with this melding of live action and cartoon characters. This, of course, is not the first melding of people and cartoon, one just has to look back at Mary Poppins, but this is the most advanced convergence of real life and cartoon life. The story involves a cartoon rabbit actor, Roger, who is accused of murder. Before Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) took over Toontown (where all of the cartoon characters live, a town that looks like it came out of a child's nightmare), there was no way to kill a cartoon character. But Doom found a way to administer capital punishment for his citizens (by using paint thinner, or course) and Roger is on the lam. He finds aid in a drunk detective (Ed Hoskins) who spiraled down from the heights of the business after a cartoon killed his partner, his brother. The movie features the sexiest cartoon character since Betty Boop, who is also in the movie, in Jessica Rabbit, married to Roger. Why would she marry Roger Rabbit? Easy, he makes her laugh. The story is a pretty standard \"whodunnit\" movie, but the movie itself is much much more than that. Such a creative merge of hardboiled detective story and cartoons of the 1940s is a joy to watch. And the end of the movie discusses the zany ideas of \"strip malls\" and \"free ways\" in such a way to bring out some of the biggest laughs of the movie.

The whole movie seems like one of those extended cartoons, though to its credit, it works out so much better than movies like the Hotel Transylvania films, Inspector Gadget, or Son of the Mask. The story offers a combination of Disney magic and Amblin exhilaration, providing a mystery that seems so familiar yet is executed in a way that it feels quite unique. The animation and cinematography are edited together in a style, with techniques like puppetry, that they seem to coexist in one setting; the live-action characters feel to the audience like they're in an animated environment (and animated characters in live-action) and they can interact with said environments either realistically (like Los Angeles) or not (like Toontown). The characters are absolutely memorable along with their acting, providing the action, comedy, and drama of a masterpiece. The songs aren't as memorable, but the sheer silliness or enjoyment of them rounds this movie out. No matter whether its ideas seem obsolete today, this is a movie that no one, including you, should miss.",

            "content": "\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" (hereafter WFRR) is an exhilarating example of a \"Hamlet Syndrome\" movie. I define a \"Hamlet Syndrome\" work as one that is so important, revolutionary, and/or complex that it has been endlessly analyzed from multiple perspectives, and therefore impossible to make an original comment upon. In other words, what can I say about this movie that hasn't been said before? For example, I'm sure I'm not the only poster who has seen this movie multiple times in the theater (5 times in my case). Also, many posters must own the VHS or DVD version; in fact, WFRR was my first VHS movie purchase and someday I will purchase the DVD. Like many posters, I adore the masterful, seamless, phantasmagoric merger of live action and animation. Sigh! I think I'll comment upon the main factor that, in my opinion, made WFRR such a success - its matter-of-fact, focused intelligence.It seems strange to call the anarchic, partly animated WFRR world focused and intelligent, but it is. The dialogue is whip-smart, sizzling, and meaningful at every moment, even when a toon is speaking it. The development of the murder mystery involving the death of Acme Products's practical joker king Marvin Acme is appropriately convoluted, twisty, and elusive. The detective Eddie Valiant is still street-smart, shrewd, and clever despite his descent into alcoholism and despair over the murder of his brother (poignantly summarized by a photo montage). Likewise, his transition from enjoying to hating toons because his brother was killed by one. The implication of the goofy Roger Rabbit in Acme's murder because of his supposed dalliance with his stunning human toon wife Jessica Rabbit. The stubbornly growing relationship between Roger and his reluctant protector Eddie. The sinister machinations of the cadaverous Judge Doom. Even the toons' fantastic feats which as Roger explains can occur only if they are funny. Every aspect of the film impresses you with its intelligence, because it is smarter than its audience.WFRR is indeed intelligent, and its intelligence extends to pleasing both kids and adults without being condescending or boring to either. Almost inevitably, this means the movie presents risqu\u00e9 dialogue and situations (e.g. Baby Herman's lament about his 40-year-old lust and his 3-year-old dinky, or Eddie's sometime girlfriend and speakeasy owner Delores commenting on the rabbit extending from his pocket). But the movie is agile and lighthearted enough to avoid offending anyone (unlike, say, Rango). The action, jokes, one-liners, and asides are all sharp and really require you to think.The entire tone of WFRR is smart, too, as well as underplayed and low-key. Even when someone acts crazy, as for example in the climax when Eddie attempts to save Roger and Jessica from being immersed in the \"dip\" by...I'm not telling, it has a serious objective. Humans interact with cartoons and sometimes even enter Toontown, the toons's abode, but they never BECOME cartoons. The tone bolsters the underlying serious themes of the movie, which are not only will Roger be acquitted, but also whether Eddie will redeem himself professionally and socially. WFRR will also teach you something about '40s film noir and detective movies, if you are observant.WFRR does something more. Its overall craft and brilliance affirms how great human beings can be, when they set their minds to something. Who would expect a collision of flesh-and-blood humans, irreverent Looney Tunes characters, and boisterous Disney characters to do that?",

They actually come into our world to act in cartoons, and do all the dangerous things we see in cartoons without getting injured. Roger Rabbit is married to shapely Jessica (Kathleen Turner voiced) and is set up, 'framed', by Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd of BTTF 'Doc Brown' fame) who in the end turns out to be a 'Toon' also.

            "content": "This movie means so much to me.WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT was an extremely important event in my personal lifetime.I was one of those who had seen in-development clips of the original ROGER RABBIT movie on The Disney Channel back in 1984 (which looked totally different in many ways), and I had thought for the longest time that it had been left for dead until it was rescued by Robert \"Back The The Future\" Zemeckis (I deliberately write his name that way because that is exactly how the press printed his name every time they mentioned him during this movie's run, so much so that I was making jokes with friends about how Zemeckis must have recently made \"Back To The Future\" his legal middle names. But I digress).This movie came out just before I was ready to turn twenty years old that September. And as I watch it now, I still love it every bit as much as I did back then, only now it also brings tears to my eyes due to its representation to me at the time.1988. We cartoonists growing up were all being mocked and told we had no futures ahead of us. I was being called by my peers an \"animation hippie\". I had grown up studying to enter the animation industry and had dreams of joining Disney to use the power of the animated cartoon to spread positive vibes and happiness around the world just as Walt used to do, and maybe even save lives. And I had spent all my youth and later my teen years feverishly studying animation and teaching myself technique, preparing myself for the big moment. I had been talking my entire life about how one day there would be a revolution in the animation industry; Hollywood's marketing eggheads would finally be overthrown, animation would one day once again belong to the people. We in the animation industry would finally have the freedom and respect as everyone else did throughout the world in our same field; we would overcome and make animation ours again, unshackling it from the hands of the greedy bosses and worms of Hollywood.I genuinely and honestly believed that.And for me, ROGER RABBIT made 1988 my 1968 animation-wise. I sat there with my long-haired, tye-dyed idealism clutching my projects and beloved cartoon icons of the past to my heart as I had cheered ROGER RABBIT on and watched it steamroll Hollywood into being forced to take animation seriously as all-ages entertainment. I saw it countless times in the theatres. Again and again and again. This was it, I had been telling friends. This was the beginning of The Revolution! WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT was my Woodstock, the huge party promising the turning point of historical culture forever and the official beginning of hoped-for dreams for change and happiness.I was so naive and innocent back then.Well, as we all know and as I discovered when I finally made my first sojourn to Hollywood, ROGER RABBIT did make it officially cool to love animation again in this country with all ages, but Hollywood... characteristically... refused to relinquish control to the animators as I had predicted. Instead, they allowed a \"carefully marketed\" version of \"hip\" new cartoons to merely cash in on the new craze. And they ran it into the ground. Now they are doing the same thing with computer animation, stupidly believing that it's the technology making hit films and not the scripts. Same old, same old. And I ended up learning a hard lesson about how Hollywood leeches art for profit, how only individuals like Walt can truly cause revolutions. And to add insult to injury, we would later get our own knock-to-reality disaster as another attempt at a \"Roger Rabbit\" move hideously trashed and ended up accidentally mocking that hope in the way that The Rolling Stones' Altamont attempt had with Woodstock, in the form of Ralph Bakshi's COOL WORLD.But even so, despite its being a disappointment as a now-shattered idealism in my life and it's now representing what *could* have been (and now just to me either, I must add!), I still love this film to pieces. The technology is beautiful and it's so enjoyable that it actually breaks my heart even further to admit what I'm about to say. And that is that while it's such a wonderful film to me both personally and artistically, it is technically also a very lousy one.Even since I saw it for the first time, several things nagged at me right from the beginning. Fortunately, the movie was still so fun that I was able to overlook them. But here are the things which bothered me:First of all, I'm afraid that Richard Williams just isn't one of my favourite directors and I honestly wish they had gotten someone else to do it. His draftsmanship is simply too elastic and too undisciplined for the animation to read properly or have genuine physical appeal on screen. As a result the characters all have an unlikeable \"rubbery\" look that I find unattractive.Second, I'm still irked at the decision to try to design the characters \"painstakingly\" to appear the way they did draft-wise back during the era where this film takes place (especially when they aren't consistent about it with all the characters, or sometimes even the same character in different scenes!). I personally would have picked a more modern-era like the 60s or 70s (the book itself took place in modern times) so as to assure better character design appeal, but the marketers were so desperate to make the film timeless that they didn't want to take chances.Third, the draftsmanship of many of the classic characters is simply awful. As a review of a \"Roger Rabbit\" catalogue book once sold at that time put it, Williams couldn't draw a lot of these characters \"to save his soul\". How true. Many look passable enough, but they are ultimately undone by the director's own personal drawing style.And fourth--and this is probably my biggest complaint--the story. It shows lots of interaction with cartoon  characters physically, but there is barely *ANY* emotional or personal interaction with them! The true ideas of humans encountering cartoon characters are blunted as a result as Zemeckis simply waters it all down to a simple piece of \"laughter is so important to us all!\" tripe, and I have yet to see anyone make a serious attempt to have genuinely deep, personal emotional interaction between toons and people (something I've worked at with all my own stories and ideas throughout my life... am I the only artist out there who sees possibilities in this concept? I used to think everyone else did too, but now I seriously wonder). I keep hoping that someday someone besides myself will be able to make the attempt on the big screen and do it convincingly.But those four things aside, I still love this movie. How can I not? It's not just a spectacular piece of work, it also meant something huge to me personally. And now these days it will forever after serve as a huge touchstone in my own personal life regarding a specific moment in time which... interestingly enough, just like the original Woodstock festival itself... was lost two years or so after \"the big victorious hurrah\"and sold out. And in the end, again like Woodstock, nothing was changed except for the worse. And it literally brings tears to my eyes to watch it today on a ***BEAUTIFULLY***-restored DVD double set in widescreen and re-feel that one special time in my life when animation in this country had finally reached the summit of victory... and we who were just on the brink of taking the nosedive into the animation industry were all celebrating while walking home after watching ROGER RABBIT for the first time with our hearts high in the sunset... and the future belonged to us...",

That mix of a beautifully-realized 1947 Los Angeles and manic toon world is well handled and makes this a great place to spend 100 minutes in. The animation is first-rate; luminous and mingles believably with the human world (and vice versa). It's a technical marvel, but really, the key to all of this actually working is Bob Hoskins.

I find Roger Rabbit a bit to wacky - as if the character is overly exaggerated trying to hard to be funny. Jessica was a bit \"over the top\" but sexy looking.

That is something I wanted to see when I was a kid - some sort of duel between the two hot-headed famous ducks. My childhood wish came true with Roger Rabbit's film - so I will not knock this movie all that hard.If you liked Roger Rabbit then you might like similar films \"Space Jam\" or \"Song of the South\". 7.5/10",

The original characters of this film, along with the established characters makes for a great time.As for Bob Hoskins, Eddie Valiant was one of his best and most famous roles.

It literally saved an entire genre -- the full length animation motion picture. Sure, it combined animation with live production, but in doing so, it was also the grandfather of CGI, where decades later, entire segments of a film were spliced with computer graphics for both special effects and extended thematic elements.For it's time in 1988, it was a technological breakthrough, setting the bar for the time so high, that it stands well over 30 years later,, more than matching up with anything made using the latest in digital technology.The production, sound, and score are off the charts outstanding, more than enough to earn multiple Academy Award nominations and a few wins. It highlighted what was a deliberately boilerplate script and turned it into a magnificent 90 minutes of pure fun.In what ends up one of the all time scene stealing moments, the tour de force song sequence for Jessica Rabbit was a masterpiece of animation and live action integration, forming a truly iconic moment in film history.It's hard to say this film is great family fare, which may ultimately have been its only downfall. But, for anyone with a better than \"three year old dinky,\" it was filled with great laughs and original moments.It's an all time film classic, that paved the path for generations of animation films that followed it.

Although if I saw this movie as a kid, I would have enjoyed every second of it, but it's a movie that leans slightly bit more for the adult audiences in my opinion. Because of the dark tone of it all, even if it involves cartoon characters. What this movie is, is a mix of the real world with noir style and the cartoon world going for it. Basically in this story real people and cartoons interact with each other and the cartoons job is basically the entertain the people which they seem to enjoy doing. When it comes to the plot it isn't anything great. But what really stands out about this movie is how the humans and cartoons interact with each other and the environment. The noir style and the acting is a bit childish but it fits most of the scenarios which also includes a place called toon town. Also Roger Rabbit can be annoying sometimes since most scenes takes place in the human world, but some of his morals saves him from being a entirely annoying and dislikable character. The grumpy detective starts out not likable as well but as the movie progresses that somewhat changes. The mix of human world and cartoon land is what made this movie work since it did a good job of it. It might seem slightly dated now but I would have been blown away if I saw it in 1988. Still a good movie, that lacks in the plot but makes up for it with other elements.6.8/10",

            "content": "First off, allow me to correct a common mistake that was made by more than one reviewer here: This is most certainly not the first film ever made where animated characters interact with live actors. Pete's Dragon (1977), Mary Poppins (1964) and Song of the South (1946) all predate it, and if you want a lesson in cartoon history, so does Gertie the Dinosaur (1914). But that doesn't mean Who Framed Roger Rabbit is not a landmark film. It was revolutionary for its degree of interaction between the toons and the human characters, done so perfectly that they seem completely natural at first glance, but then amaze when you take a closer look - little things like Jessica Rabbit pinching Eddie Valiant's cheek, or Roger Rabbit hiding under the water in Valiant's sink, or beneath his coat, little details that took very creative special effects to be made convincing. It's also unique and original in the fact that some of it takes place in the real world, featuring animated characters, and some in an animated world, featuring live actors; and in that manner, it predates Cool World, Space Jam and anything following.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is wonderfully funny, directed more at an adult audience than children. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd make a terrific impression in the lead roles, and manage to stay remarkably serious and convincing while conversing and interacting with entirely imaginary characters. Charles Fleischer is beyond brilliant in the voice of Roger Rabbit (as well as that of Benny the Cab) and Kathleen Turner as Jessica Rabbit is also terrific, a femme fatale so classic that it's ridiculous. The entire film excels with intelligent humor that would appeal to both children and adults, and it's a treat for animation buffs, with references to historical toons from the Foxy cartoons of the 20s, through Betty Boop, Dumbo and Bambi to Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the defining films of my childhood; I think that's true for almost anyone born in the 80s. I still have a warm place in my heart for Roger and Eddie Valiant, and a cold one for Judge Doom, who gave me nightmares for weeks after I saw it upon its initial release when I was four (he still gives me chills, by the way, when he first starts talking in his squeaky voice). If you somehow manages to avoid it, do watch it, and if you're willing, it's well worth the purchase, too.",

I saw this in the theater when it came out, I imagine based on reviews by Siskel and Ebert. They raved about the wonderful blending of cartoon characters and real people and how the script created this world where \"Toons\" live and interact with people, with the Toons behaving like their film characters-you can drop a piano on them and they are unharmed, etc.The idea sounded neat but the film had some huge problems. It started with an actual cartoon to introduce the star, Roger Rabbit, who incredibly was left to babysit for an actual baby, despite him having no skills at this whatsoever. Before you know it, the baby is destroying the house like a one-man Three Stooges, and doing several things to Roger, by accident, as the baby is trying to get to some out-of-reach cookies, that if done to a real person would have killed him three or four different ways.One example: Roger gets flung into an oven that the baby accidentally dials past the highest temperature to a setting called \"Volcano.\" And he is depicted as being left in there long enough that when he is finally sent flying out of the oven, he looks like a big lump of charcoal. Too extreme to be funny.Throughout the film Roger is nothing but annoying. He wasn't likeable or funny and although I didn't want to see him killed by the many evil characters trying to, he just wasn't a character we wanted to care about.There is excessive foul language in here, and a great many sexually suggestive scenes and dialogue. I believe I would have been embarrassed to have taken my kids to see this, had I such a chance. It's not mildly suggestive, but quite blatant, and there are enough to make this more than annoying to a parent.Roger is married to a cartoon woman named Jessica. She is drawn in such a way as to suggest her \"measurements\" are 42\"-7\"-32.\" Virtually the whole movie, she is wearing a shoulder-less dress that barely has her breasts halfway covered, and it is rather creepy to see the real-life actors seemingly staring at her breasts and getting aroused. I'm not kidding-this happens. They even have some male figure reaching into the top of her dress and pulling out some object, with the quip being that it was a \"booby trap.\"Oh they do have short clips of many famous old cartoon characters from their old films so I guess that was a plus. But most of them are on screen for about 8 seconds and don't have time to say or do anything funny.This mingling of real and cartoon is the only real reason to watch this film. Sort of like folks before my time in the 1950s went to see films in 3-D for a while, before realizing that the movies made in 3-D were so lame they weren't worth seeing. Top film producers felt this effect would distract people from a good film, so they didn't film any of their expected big hits that way.To anyone reading this who liked this Roger Rabbit movie, I put it to you this way: Had they made this just the way they did except with ALL the characters animated, would you still think it's a good movie? Good enough to rate higher than the 4 I give it?",

Maroon - the head of Maroon Cartoon Studios - to investigate rumours of adultery. Jessica, the wife of one of his stars, Roger Rabbit, is supposedly having an affair with Marvin Acme, the owner of Acme Corporation and Toontown.Eddie is a grumpy man who likes his Scotch, but in need of money, so he takes the job. When Roger Rabbit learns of his wife's affair, he is devastated, and when Marvin Acme is found murdered the next day, Roger becomes the prime suspect.The animation - movement, shadows, interaction - blends fantastic with real actors; incredibly well considered the film was made over three decades ago. When Roger takes refuge with Eddie, Eddie must do everything in his power to uncover the truth. However, there are much more than meets the eye, as secrets and cover-ups are revealed.Christopher Lloyd stars as the film's antagonist, Judge Doom, who found a way to destroy toons, hence they are petrified of him.

Annoying voice, annoying personality, NEVER a funny line, movement, or gesture. Well, if he was not funny, then he was likable? No. Not funny plus annoying is not a good start in a title character. And, Jessica Rabbit, how did Roger ever marry her. Why would he want to, no personality, flirt, just a sleazy trouble magnet. Further, why would she want to marry him?. A nerdy, screw-up. And, why was she drawn with such dripping sexuality? I was torn between hoping her gown would slip off, and wondering why I was thinking such thoughts about a cartoon. Weird. Sick. Yuck. Hoskins did a yeoman's job, but most of his accomplishment was acting to the animated characters. As a character in a drama, I thought he came off a little flat.

One of the movie's greatest achievements is its meticulous and loving creation of an alternate world, a dream-L.A. that never existed but in some ways is better than the real thing, an homage to the imagination of old popular culture.  It also slips in some criticism of domination by big corporations (an odd thing for a movie coming out of the studio system), by contrasting, in the viewer's mind, the L.A. of the movie world with that of today, which is precisely what Cloverleaf Industries wants to create.  Indeed, the corruption associated with the building of the freeways was a real event in the 1940's, so the fantastical elements gain immediacy by not utterly straying from reality, just as the toons seem solid by interacting with humans.",

But when a few photos starts a bigger investigation into murder the case soon hots up.This film was a complete break through in movies. There has been a few movies where live action was mixed with animation, but this was so far ahead of all of the others that the others were not in the same league.The whole film is so well done. The way the actors mix with the cartoons is amazing and most of the time you can't really tell they are not looking at anything. The whole cast did a fantastic job.The film stars Bob Hoskins. Bob is a legend and it is a shame that he has retired. For me this is his best film. Other cast members were Christopher Lloyd. Christopher played Judge Doom. A judge that has found a way to kill \"toons\". He actually plays quite a scary character. I remember watching this as a kid and thinking he was freaky. Especially at the end of the movie. Joanna Cassidy was also one of the main characters. The voice work was awesome too. Charles Fleischer is the voice of Roger as well as a lot of other characters.

It is one of my childhood favourites and will stay with me my whole life. I will watching this film again and again. I will never get bored of it... I can't wait until my baby girl is old enough to watch it with me. I want it to be a part of her childhood too.The main thing I love about this movie is the characters that were put together...

Betty Boop, Tweetie Pie, Daffy Duck, Goofy... the list just goes on and on.I honestly love this film and have nothing bad to say about it.

I didn't like watching the opening cartoon film since Roger Rabbit was irresponsible with being a babysitter. Seriously he's the worst babysitter ever. I also didn't like it that Herman the baby caused kitchenware to spill and the rolling pin tripping Roger and getting him baked in the oven or getting electrocuted or having pots and pans falling on his head and getting hit with a refrigerator.I also didn't like Herman the baby who was a rude baby. I didn't like how extremely annoying Roger was to Eddie and I didn't like the hot sauce scene as it scared me I didn't like Roger vandalizing dishes or being a showoff and later on with the acid gun threating to hit Roger and Jessica.I actually liked Eddie the grumpy detective much better and I've felt sorry for him that his brother was murdered. I liked Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom up until it depicted him as a creepy cartoon after being run over by a steamroller and then burning in acid at the factory. I didn't like the weasel cartoon mafia gang that they would go around hurting people or trying to kill Roger Rabbit.I was shocked at the PG-13 profanity used in Roger Rabbit just like in Back to the Future. I also didn't like the sexy scenes with Jessica Rabbit showing her big breasts or her leg thighs or when Mavin cheated on Roger Rabbits wife and committed adultery which made me very uncomfortable, it was very awkward to for me to watch. I was shocked at the graphic violence with the acid dip eraser killing the cartoon shoe and even killing one of the weasel gang members.The car chase and car crash scene involving hitting police officers on their motorcycles was scary for me to watch. I didn't like it that Judge Doom caused Benny the cab to crash into a light pole. I didn't like that annoying cartoon woman chasing after Eddie.The only parts I liked in the film it that we got to meet Disney characters like Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Dumbo, Fantasia characters, Three Little Pigs, Pinocchio at Toontown. I also liked the Warner Bros characters Yosemite Sam, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Sylvester. Meeting Droopy, Woody Woodpecker, Betty Boop.I think that the live action actors like Bob Hoskin and Christopher Lloyd did a better job in the movie than most of the main cartoon characters.Richard Williams involved with this live action animated film later on tried to finish funding The Thief and the Cobbler before it was wrongfully taken away from him.I'm Surprised the Disney company would be allowed to show this PG-13 rated semi adult animated cartoon this film on Disney Plus which should've been on Hulu. I'm also surprised they would actually have Roger Rabbit at Disneyland since he's from a PG-13 rated film.I would not recommend this PG-13 semi adult animated film to kids and families since this is one of those mature themed cartoons with sexy scenes and graphic violence. I would watch Space Jam or The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle instead since they were more enjoyable to watch, you're also better off watching An American Tail, also I'd rather watch Back to the Future instead of Roger Rabbit since it was more fun to watch.Suggested MPAA rating: Rated PG-13 for partial nudity, suggestive content, graphic cartoon violence, some scary scenes, smoking, alcohol use, crude humor, language.",

            "content": "Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a 1988 film released by Disney affiliate Touchstone Pictures combining the use of animation and live-action. The film stars Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd (\"Back to the Future Trilogy\"), and Joanna Cassidy as the human actors and the films cartoon characters are Saturday morning favorites that are some of the most popular cartoon characters of all-time like Looney Toons favorites Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Yosemite Sam; Disney favorites Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pinocchio, and Dumbo; Tex Avery classics like Augie Doggie and Woody Woodpecker; and the black-and-white favorite Betty Boop. The plot is very well executed as it is set in 1947 Hollywood during the time that is regarded as the \"Golden Age of Animation.\" When Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer), the main character of the story, is shown pictures of his wife Jessica Rabbit playing \"patty-cake\" with Marvin Acme, owner of Acme cartoons, Acme is murdered and Roger becomes the prime suspect, thus bringing in reluctant private-eye Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) to investigate the mysterious murder. While investigating the murder, he runs into the evil Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) and his wisecracking laughing weasel henchman, who are most likely to be the culprits behind the murder. Then, Valiant soon interrogates R.K. Maroon, owner of rival company Maroon Cartoons and he confesses that he blackmailed Jessica into doing what she did with Acme because Maroon wanted to sell his studio to Cloverleaf but then soon after telling the truth, he is mysteriously murdered as well, leading Valiant into Toontown, where he comes under the impression that Jessica is the suspect when he thinks she is trying to shoot him, but she was trying to shoot Judge Doom instead, who is the real mastermind behind the mysterious murders of Acme and Maroon because he wants to take over Toontown. This movie, at the time of its release, was regarded as a film that regained interest in the art of animation and sparked the beginning of the Disney Renaissance. While Disney oversaw much of the film, this film was released under the Touchstone banner mainly because of the numerous innuendos in the film and the amount of language there is in here thus giving it a PG rating (although nowadays there's things in this movie that were considered PG then in 1988 that are considered PG-13 in 2012). All that aside, I grew up enjoying this movie and it is the definition of a classic in every way: amazing plot, great characters, and a great music score by Alan Silvestri that fits the film perfectly. If you have not seen this classic piece of American film yet; what are you waiting for? Watch it when it comes on TV again (it usually airs on Cartoon Network) or rent the movie! It's coming out on DVD/Blu-Ray to honor the 25th Anniversary of the movie next year so if you like it enough, buy it!!! Be sure to watch with your kids though as this is not your normal \"family movie\" like \"The Lion King\" or \"Aladdin.\" Jessica Rabbit is quite the revealing cartoon character in dress style and Baby Herman looks like a two-year old, but acts like a fifty-year old and has the mouth and characteristics of one as he smoke cigarettes and swears. Still one of the more enjoyable films to watch with the family compared to some films being released today. Rating: 10/10!!!",

I also think that Who Framed Roger Rabbit has a better story line. In Space Jam they just base a basketball game on saving the day.

To be honest though I had hoped I would enjoy it a lot more than I ultimately did. I hoped for two things going in, I hoped to be invested in the mystery, and I hoped to find it funny. The movie failed on both of those fronts for me. The mystery the title presents isn't like a whodunnit, it's just something that we assume will eventually be revealed by the end of the film. And the comedy was strange. I had hoped it would be aimed at adults (which it kind of is) but the humour is stuff only children would ever find funny. There's a very strange tone in this film.I'm sure that back in 1988 the animation achieved here was a real milestone and the filmmakers deserve credit for that. And even though they seemed to want an adult tone at times, they would've been pretty limited by how far they could push it. I would be interested though how much children actually enjoy this film. It feels like the a film that kids could hate, and adults could as well. It didn't work for me anyway. 5/10.",

            "content": "Who Framed Roger Rabbit plays like a high scoring Masters thesis on the various aspects of the film noir genre via an edition of a Beano comic; a placing together of two wildly differing texts inside of a concentrated experiment tank beside lit ACME dynamite, the resultant explosion's remnants being what it is that splatters all over our film screens forming what is a dizzy array of colours and wonder which grabs us from the beginning and never lets up. American director Robert Zemeckis' 1988 film is a deliriously enjoyable noir in its most extremest of forms; a hardened example of cross pollination, further still feeding off of decades of inspiration and homage, just cascading together into something else totally out of the ordinary al\u00e1 Sin City or Blade Runner, as decidedly postmodern generic fabrications thrust together. Despite the hallmarks of creativity, the film is never preoccupied with its hook; going on to formulate an impressive and really quite affecting character study in amidst a narrative that is challenging; never overbearing and never thinks of its audience as idiots.The film follows a lowly, dishevelled private investigator named Eddie Valiant (Hoskins); a man living off of the reputation he has in solving mysteries that he did so effectively in the days during which his now deceased brother was still alive and working with him. The film wastes little time in constructing Valiant as the embittered lead he is, the hitching of unpaid rides on the rear carts of trams to get around town and the swigging of hard alcohol straight out of the bottle at whatever chance he gets when alone the norm; whereas down at a local bar, a one-time relationship with a waitress that might have gone somewhere, but has now mutated into that of quick acquaintances, the closest he has to a friend. By night, we see him attend an upmarket club that is putting on a comedy double act \u2013 where everyone else sees the funny side, Valiant is too indebted to his cynicism to even break a smile.Valiant is a living embodiment of a generic convention if ever there was one, but played with the sorts of creativity and wonder operating around him so much so that we enjoy seeing this familiarised core archetype at the centre of such a premise. He despises those with whom he exists; despises them for that one of them was involved in the death of that aforementioned brother, and the grudge has stuck. Those of whom he exists with are \"toons\"; cartoon characters literally walking, talking and existing with the humans within this world of 1947 Los Angeles - a breaking of a reality so shocking, that the film distills how we react through that of its lead when Valiant himself exclaims upon the first instance of that 'wall' being broken.'Toons seem bound to serving that of the humans to some degree, be it in the form of waiting on tables; acting as doormen; barmen or even, in the case of Disney's famous elephant lead Dumbo, an acting talent for a major film studio - one wonders what role it might be possible for Dumbo to play besides that of Dumbo. Director Zemeckis gets all the fun of the fair out of these ideas, accommodating various 'toons to professions that suit their characteristics, in that an exceptionally large gorilla is a doorman; an octopus is able to work several orders at once behind the bar and animated penguins make for waddling waiters serving customers.In the grandest of noir traditions, corruption where there really ought not be any, is afoot; Christopher Lloyd's local judicial chief, aptly named Doom, and his team of 'toon weasel assistants form the film's source of conflict. Doom's arrival, clad all in black and with a walking stick plus-limp creating a false sense of harmlessness, is via a canted angle as Valiant peers upwards at him; an apparent oneupmanship already underway as Doom incorrectly entrusts to have caught Valiant in an act. Doom and his team are scouring the city for the titular Roger Rabbit following the belief he murdered a film producer. His 'toon wife Jessica, uniquely sporting human-like characteristics away from those of an anthropomorphic nature, was involved with this producer but it is a crime Roger maintains he did not commit. In crying out to Valiant for help, in turn offering him the chance to put to bed his 'toon-hating ways and going back on a case he'd only previously had taken with his brother whose death still resonates, the fun that is Who Framed Roger Rabbit kicks off.Where a lot of noir's tone is born out of post-war disillusionment, the two very different inflections of Valiant and Roger clash head-on in a physical sense when the lead finds himself working with him, a raucous 'toon whom cannot help but exclaim loudly and proudly at whatever chance he gets, making for great humour when in danger, and yet stands in stark binary opposition to that of Valiant's more downcast stature eventually making for excellent comedy and drama. Zemeckis deals with everything wonderfully well, using such a concept to act as a backdrop to intelligent film-making and utilising such a notion to formulate wondrous comedy in what is a thoroughly enjoyable and surprisingly smart comedy; a film that rocks along without letting up for a second. From its audacious opening to its familiar finale of good vs. evil fighting one on one, only with a total overhaul of creativity and mirth via the dizzy array of ideas the screenwriters are permitted to work with given the setting, the film is at once wholly rich in detail between animation and live-action; funny for people of most ages; arrives with a real sense of threat and danger maintaining drama and generally instills a good feeling.",

            "content": "\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" is not an exercise in exciting murder mystery. The plot is generally unexciting and unoriginal. But all it needs to be is enough to give this ground- breaking mixture of animation and live action room to reach it's potential -- enough to make sure all the cartoon/human jokes could be made and all the muscles of the technology flexed. That's what makes \"Roger Rabbit\" fascinating the whole way through. You're almost left intrigued only to see if they're going to be able to pull it off the whole movie.Roger Rabbit is a Bugs Bunny rip-off who in this world is a working actor that has a trouble- making reputation. When a toon-film mogul named R.K Maroon wants to send a message to Roger to get his act together, he hires a P.I named Eddie Valiant, the film's whiskey-swilling film noir-esquire protagonist, to follow Roger's red-headed bombshell (and animated) wife, Jessica, who might be having an affair with the head of ACME, the man who owns Toon- Town -- where everything animated lives. When Roger learns of Jessica's \"affair,\" it's not long before he's framed for ACME's murder. Valiant reluctantly befriends the rabbit and takes his case.One of the impressive things about the film is it obtained rights to both Warner Bros. and Disney characters. There are countless appearances and part of the fun is picking out which characters are from what. It's a tribute to the world of cartoons by projecting how cartoon characters would act if they were real. That's much of the humor right there of this inventive film. There's a unique cartoon-induced style to all the jokes, fusing the world of live action and 2D brilliantly together. It's in this spirit that a film like \"Roger Rabbit\" works and that a film just putting the two together for visual effect falls short.It's also a film for adults. A child would get some of the hijinx, but it's definitely not an appropriate kids film. It comes from the adult perspective on cartoons and plays off the maturity of an audience that grew up loving cartoons.The only thing the movie lacks other than a bit more of a creative plot structure is good acting. Christopher Lloyd is always a fan favorite (he skyrocketed director Robert Zemeckis' previous film \"Back to the Future\"), but Bob Hoskins is not leading man material. He's great at interacting with nobody (after all, most of his scenes take place with actors that were drawn in later), but there's the charm of star power missing from the film other than cameos by Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny.\"Roger Rabbit\" is a classic in the sense that nothing else is like it and anything that's tried hasn't been as clever. Robert Zemeckis has made a career reinventing the way we see movies and this late 80s film marked just the beginning.",

Seamless incorporation of live-action and animation, astonishing technical innovations, a cavalcade and gathering of beloved animation characters unlike anything they audiences had seen before. It was a revolution and largely helped launch Disney's Renaissance, their greatest golden age to date.And it has endured the test of time remarkably well. This film is older than I am, but its message of acceptance, endurance and the ability to face the world with a laugh is still as relevant as it was back then. It's a timeless movie, and even though it is known for its technical achievements, its story has enough depth to stand on par with them.The characters and actors are also delightfully varied and played by topnotch actors. We have the no-nonsense, deadbeat, humourless private detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), who still manages to deliver some of the best punchlines through his deadpan delivery. We have Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleischer) and his wife Jessica Rabbit (Kathleen Turner), who manage to be an effective and heartwarming couple despite their differences, or perhaps because of them. And then we have Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd), who could not be more perfect for his role, especially keeping in mind the ending. All these characters have great chemistry together, they all have great lines and together they're a riot of laughs, action and humour.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is definitely worth a watch for the whole family.

The Toons have there own home, Toontown, but there star in live-action films and can do almost anything. A high-boiled, heavy drinking Private Detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), whom brother was murdered by a Toon, is assigned a case by a movie studio to take incriminating photos of Jessica Rabbit (voiced Kathleen Turner) and Acme Corporation owner Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye) to get Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) to focus on his latest movie. But when Marvin Acme is found dead Roger Rabbit is the prime suspect, with the sadistic Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) is determined to destroy the Toon. But upon further investigation by Valiant he discovers a wider conspiracy over the ownership of Toontown.With a budget of $70 Million Who Framed Roger Rabbit was a very expensive film for its time. Director Robert Zemeckis is known for using the most state of the art technology available to him. He uses it to great effect, blending live-action and animation together. For children they will enjoy seeing cartoon characters and live-action actors working together on screen and the over-the-top slapstick comedy that animation can offer. The animation is very much of the style of a Looney Toons cartoons that I used to watch when I was younger, with similarities to Tom and Jerry shorts. There is also pretty of verbal comedy and it does play on its crossover, like the rivalry between Donald Duck and Daffy Duck. But there is pretty for adults, with elements of film noir in direction, character and plot, strong in jokes of classic cartoons and filmmaking and excellent writing with it's plot and characterisation. There is of course also a nostalgia factor.Who Framed Roger Rabbit was Hoskins' first major Hollywood film and he does an excellent job as the serious Private Detective who harbours bitter feelings towards Toons. He plays the role very much like a detective with the usual backstory and problems: but ends up forming a partnership with some very zany characters. He also had a tough job because for the most part Hoskins had to act alone. He shows his comic side as well and with Zemeckis' skilled direction show a compelling backstory to the character. Lloyd was brilliant as the sinister, scary and sadistic villain: he truly captures evil and is more scary then most horror villains. His sadism is shown by ruthlessly killing an animated shoe which is enough to give people nightmares for weeks.A great family film.",

This was the first film in which I saw Hoskins. But not the last. Since then, were ZULU DAWN, and HOOK, to name a few. When seeing Eddie Valiant, I had no trouble accepting Hoskins as an American. But when I saw ZULU, I found, as in other films, that he actually has a strong British accent, and fit the role of a Color Sergeant Major in the British Army very well. He's a truly gifted, and in my opinion, the epitome of a versatile actor. He can do anything and I've never ceased to be amazed by his range of characters. Not many serious dramatic actors would have taken on the WFRR role and done as well or seemingly had so much fun with it, but I'd bet that Hoskins took the job of acting with a whole range of totally nonexistent characters, the Toons, and making it work sa a personal challenge. Also, kudos to Charles Fleischer for the great Roger Rabbit voice.",

            "content": "This was such an amazing piece of work when it came out. I just saw it again, and it was just a bit dated. But while the physical part of mixing cartoon and live action was excellent, the best part was the writing, the envisioning of a world where interactions between \"toons\" and humans were commonplace. Fantastic work by Bob Hoskins, particularly in losing his English accent and sounding completely like a bitter, hard-boiled, mid-40's, SoCal, PI. Most of the time, when an actor fakes an accent, it will bleed through a bit in some scenes. One could blame the director for this, not being willing to take enough takes to make sure that he never has to use one that doesn't sound right. But Hoskins was utterly Streepian here.\nInteresting that some felt there were themes of racism and genocide in this movie. OK, I guess the genocide angle is fairly explicit, except that it never really occurred to me because the \"toons\" weren't seen as human. (Although now that I think about it, the weasels were depicted as having souls) But it's just too much of a stretch to see \"toons\" as being analogous to \"coons\". I cannot imagine Disney or Zemeckis going there at all. \"Toons\" were, in this film, gently treated as subhuman, simply because they WERE subhuman, and nobody was interested in denying that reality out of some sort of cartoon political correctness. Anyway, this film is a masterpiece, even if a silly one, and it comes highly recommended by me. Grade: A",

At the tender age of 8 I remember going to the theatre to watch it with the family and everybody loved it! Directed by Robert Zemeckis who is also a director who when thinking of his movies I am not sure there was one of his I didn't like.R.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern) thinks Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Kathleen Turner) is nothing but bad news for his big act Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer). So he hires Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) to get some photos of Roger's wife to maybe get Roger's head back in the game. Thing is Valiant has got a history with toons and hates them. Once Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye) is found dead guess who they think did it? You guessed it. Poor old Roger though he turns to Valiant for help.I think Hoskins is awesome in his role as Valiant along with the voice work of Fleischer and Turner is top notch. Also in the cast is Christopher Lloyd and Joanna Cassidy. So, if you are like I was a big fan of Bugs Bunny this is a must-see and you shouldn't be dissatisfied with the entertainment you receive.",

Honestly, it might drive a few people insane, but I believe the majority of us would be totally fine with it. Well unfortunately, that kind of fantasy isn't around so in place of that, we have this movie that honestly would make every single cartoon lover fall over with happiness. Just like The Avengers (2012) where that contained all the favorite characters, so does this - all one's favorite cartoon characters are all in one movie.What's interesting is that this movie plays like a regular detective movie but with cartoons. This is a unique step because any film after that to incorporate cartoons into their story would be just to stop an evil mastermind with a supporting human character that just didn't give the audience the believability they needed to have the best connection with. So this story does take place in the 1940's, but, that's when times and the technology used was simpler and crimes were solved with just a few clues. The plot revolves around a cartoon star named Roger Rabbit who ends up getting framed for homicide.Leading this investigation is a troubled detective named Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) who has a tragic history. Together, when these two are paired up, it makes an interesting watch due to how well this whole movie was made. And it's not just this duo that makes the film an interesting watch. Along with the set of famous cartoons that have their own cameos in this picture, comes a bunch of new characters that also display their own charm. The Weasels, Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd), Baby Herman and several others are an interesting bunch of cartoons.The most astounding element to this film is the animation and puppetry used to make the cartoons look as lifelike and three-dimensional as possible. It is by far, the most convincing live-action special effects ever done for a live-action cartoon film. It may have been done for the other films to come after, but it just doesn't match the quality here. The effects just look so much more real. Also the musical score provided by Alan Silvestri may have not been special in a sense that it provided a main theme for Roger Rabbit, but he have one for Eddie Valiant and much of it were jazzy tunes involving bass lines. This helped support the period that the story takes place. However, the music was a little short on running time. But either way, it must be seen; it has Warner Brother and Disney cartoons sharing the same frame!If one wants to experience a cartoon ensemble movie, this is the one to see. The acting is superb, the characters are lovable and it has a great story.",

It was just the best movie to do so and still remains the best.Who Framed Roger Rabbit helped popularize the double usage. Yogi Bear, Smurfs, Casper, and Alvin & The Chipmunks are some of the best known movies like Roger Rabbit of recent times. The first reason Roger Rabbit surpasses those is because of the kind of animation that is used. The pure CGI stuff used in Yogi Bear and Smurfs is easy as hell in comparison with this. The 80s was when people needed to draw out cartoons by hand. I highly doubt there were 50 frames drawn by hand per-second used for the cartoons, but whatever. I saw a special feature that looked through how the actors would be communicating with the cartoons, and that was enough. Roger Rabbit provides constant asking \"How do they do that?\" I don't want to know anymore behind-the-scenes tricks because the magic would be lost.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is not specifically for children. Kids under the age of 9 should be accompanied by adults. There's sexual innuendo, drinking, smoking, and profanity out of youngsters' reach. Besides, adults would appreciate the work that went into it and understand the story better. This is a neo-noir, so the story is guaranteed to be complex. Bob Hoskins plays a down-on-his-luck detective named Eddie Valiant who is sent to spy on Roger Rabbit's wife Jessica who is suspected of cheating on him with the owner of Toontown. It is true and Roger is heartbroken. The next day, the man is murdered and Roger is the prime suspect. Baby Herman explains Roger is innocent and mentions the man's plans of Toontown. Soon, Valiant uncovers a deadly conspiracy of betrayal, lies, deceit and murder in which Roger and his wife are just a small piece of the puzzle.This is a truly funny movie and all characters are lovable. This uses every film noir trick in the book but adds warmth and hilarity with wonderful cartoons.4/4",

Maroon wants to wise up her husand, Roger, after he is flubbing his lines, and the studio head heard Jessica is cheating on him, however, Roger is soon framed for the murder of Marvin Acme, the man Jessica is cheating with, and the will to Toontown goes missing as well. Eddie has to protect Roger, as he is hunted down a gang of weasels led by Toontown's sinister court judge, Judge Doom (played by Christopher Lloyd).This film is one of the best of the 1980's, and it's proven. A murder mystery involving cartoon characters, the film achieves a technical feat allowing the toons to be in a live-action setting, a great technical feat, as while past movies did this, this was for a scene or two, this one does it for the whole movie, using methods that would allow the special effects crew to edit in the toons. While this is more for older kids and adults, as it does have some language and content parents may not want to expose their kids to, it is a legendary movie, with a good story, acting, and most of all, it has cameos from cartoon classics like Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny.",

            "content": "Honestly, it was a GIF of Christopher Lloyd from the finale of this film that made me want to finally give this movie a thorough chance, but even that part didn't vibe as much for me as it did when I saw it in the GIF form with no audio. It came off as very surrealist, and pretty frightening - it made me think, \"Whoa, maybe Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a much darker movie that I realized\". Upon conversing with people, that seemed to be the consensus. However, after watching, I can't say that I agree.What's actually dark about this movie? Almost nothing, other than the fact that one person dies (though he was a bad person), and so does one living, breathing, cartoon shoe. Outside of that, it's mostly your standard Looney Tunes vibes crossed with your standard detective movie vibes - though it never goes as dark or complex as the best of that film genre - it always floats on a very surface level with it, focusing more on tongue-in-cheek references to cartoons and redundant themes rather than spending time creating any truly heady plot twists or surprises, as all great noir films do.For the first 20-30 minutes, I was really having a pretty good time. Of course, the way the animation is crossed with the live action is impressive, and has never quite been done the way it's done here. That is, by far, the strongest suit of the movie. Bob Hoskins hatred towards \"toons\" was quite comical at first, until they add in the dramatic \"a toon killed my brother\" element, which immediately removes all humor from this otherwise hilarious part of his character's personality. What's left once you take the humor away from that? Literally nothing else. Bob Hoskin's character is 1-dimensional as a mug, and once that's tainted he is ruined. He's irritable, he hates toons - and there's NOTHING else to him. Half way through the film, he becomes completely redundant, and stops being likable. And then, there's Roger Rabbit himself, who is just much, much, much worse. I guess they purposely found the MOST annoying voice actor possible? His voice is like nails on a chalkboard, and so is...his personality. There is nothing enjoyable about Roger Rabbit, ever, throughout the entire film. Through the main body of the film, when he has the most screen time, I honestly really wanted something to happen to him so he would just go away.Outside of Roger Rabbit himself being barely tolerable, the strangely unappealing casting, and the abrasive sound editing which has all obnoxious cartoon sound effects mixed at about 175% volume over all other dialogue, music, and FX, Who Framed Roger Rabbit does still manage to be a rather entertaining movie from start to finish. It's just that once it's over, I look back and it's the things I disliked that stuck with me most. Jessica Rabbit is an icon for a reason. Christopher Lloyd and his \"dip\" were quite memorable, but aside from those two - I didn't really find any other characters in this film likable at all, nor were there any sequences that I feel I'd ever want to see again.Maybe COOL WORLD really is better than this?!",

Bob Hoskins is the alcoholic detective who must solve the case of....who framed roger rabbit. He does a wonderful job in the role and acts opposite an imaginary character with ease. Roger Rabbit himself is a zany character that is in love with Jessica Rabbit, a busty bombshell of a character with flowing red hair. She is of course the femme fatale.

As I see it, this film ranks up there with GHOST BUSTERS, BACK TO THE FUTURE, and the INDIANA JONES (original) trilogy as one of the most memorable films of the '80s. It's entertaining for both kids and adults, equal parts loony and suspenseful. Based on a mystery novel by Gary K. Wolf (which I'm now reminded I really want to read), the film is set in a world where cartoons and real life coexists side-by-side, also known as every kid's dream. Cartoon characters inhabit a colorful world known as Toontown that somehow exists next to Los Angeles (awfully convenient, really). The movie is a wacky adventure mixed with film noir set in the late 1940s. Private detective Eddie Valiant is hired to trail the wife of famed cartoon star Roger Rabbit and prove that she's having an affair with cartoon gadget mogul Marvin Acme. Roger doesn't respond to the news well and, when Marvin Acme turns up dead, Roger's the number one suspect. Roger pleads with Valiant, a toon-hater since the day one dropped a piano on his brother's head, to help clear his name and protect him from the brooding Judge Doom. Doom has developed a chemical mixture known as \"dip\" and it's the only real means of killing a toon, which he appears to do with great pleasure. Valiant is the one man who can clear Roger's name, find Acme's true killer, and unravel a conspiracy that may result in the end of Toontown.If you've somehow gone this long without seeing this movie, there's something wrong with you and you need to remedy it as soon as possible. It doesn't matter how old a person is, there's something here for everyone. For example, it's the only time we've been able to see the world's most beloved cartoon characters from all major studios come together in the same film: Mickey Mouse skydiving with Bugs Bunny, Donald and Daffy Duck in a piano battle, etc. It's enough to blow a kid's mind and nostalgic enough that anyone who grew up on these cartoons will get a kick out of it. That's not to say the movie is all cartoon zaniness. I'll be honest and I'm sure I'm not the only one who can say that Judge Doom scared the ever-loving crap out of me when I was younger. Christopher Lloyd is down-right creepy as the film's antagonist, dressed all in black with an evil deliberate feel to every move he makes. The scene in the Acme Warehouse where he demonstrates the effectiveness of his dip on a cartoon shoe is pretty messed up when you think about it. He dips the shoe into the toxic mixture and when he pulls his gloved hand out of the barrel, it's covered in goopy red ink/paint to really drive home the point that he just killed the toon. And don't get me started on the final act where Valiant confronts the villain. I'll spare excessive details for the uninitiated, but I was four-years-old when the movie came and I still remember how terrified I was. I'm just saying.The characters in this movie have become iconic: Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman, and especially Jessica Rabbit (who's been widely recognized as the hottest cartoon creation ever, no doubt due in part to Kathleen Turner's vocal performance). They may never be as widely beloved as the classic characters (Mickey, Bugs, etc.) but they left their mark on my childhood just the same. Judge Doom is a crazy S.O.B. and ranks as one of my all-time favorite movie villains, and Bob Hoskins is a great sport for all the craziness as Eddie Valiant. The story is complex enough for an adult audience with some older humor sprinkled in for the \"grown-ups\" to get a laugh and the kids get a zany ride in a world where cartoons are real. No offense to BACK TO THE FUTURE and it's massive fan base (of which I'm a part), but I think this film is Robert Zemeckis' best.",

            "content": "In Robert Zemeckis' \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" the titular rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) goes on the run from the law after being framed for a crime he didn't commit. With the help of private dick Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) he sets out to clear his name and get to the bottom of the murderous plot.The acting is better than you would normally expect for what is ostensibly a kids' movie. Bob Hoskins, despite his British origins, fits seamlessly into the role of a seedy private eye. Christopher Lloyd deserves special mention as the menacing Judge Doom. The voice talent for the animated characters is top-notch, with Charles Fleischer imbuing Roger with plenty of personality and Kathleen Turner lending her unmistakable voice to the femme fatale Jessica. Of course, there's also the legendary Mel Blanc and others voicing the established characters who appear in cameo roles.The story is an interesting one though I'm doubtful of how many children will be able to follow a story that has stylistic similarities to \"Chinatown\". The script also has plenty of double entendres that I'm sure flew well over my head when I saw this as a kid close to twenty years ago. These elements make the story appeal to adults while kids will no doubt enjoy the shenanigans of the animated characters.Zemeckis' direction is well handled as usual though I can't help but wish that the film had been helmed by executive producer Steven Spielberg instead. Nevertheless, Zemeckis and the Richard Williams-led animators do a fine job of blending the live and animated action, all without the benefit of CGI. The film is still impressive today and deserved all of the accolades that it garnered on the basis of its technical merit.This is a film that should appeal to both the young and the young at heart, especially those who grew up watching the likes of Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse and others. It is nothing short of a celebration of animation, produced by talented professionals with passion and reverence.",

Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the first films from a specific genre of animated feature films. For the late 80s, not everyone could shoot this, and Robert Zemeckis, who was at the peak of popularity, also directed. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is both comedy and detective and even partly noir. In this film, everyone will find something they are interested in. The plot of this children's film, everything is banal and simple, there is no intrigue that is inherent in neo-noir films. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is definitely worth watching for children, the film can be an excellent example for acquaintance with adult cinema, I advise everyone to watch.",

            "content": "\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is one of those movies that gets better and better with each viewing. It amazed me the first time I saw it; it amazed me even more the second and wait eagerly for my third encounter with this dazzling little wonder of a movie. Apart from being wonderful entertainment, it is also a first-class example of Hollywood's greatest special effects done with purposeful and pleasing imagination. It's also a movie that you will find yourself going back to many times not merely because it is so endlessly entertaining, but to try and answer a question you find yourself asking over and over again as you watch it: how did they do it?The movie is (very) loosely based on a book by Gary Wolf called \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit.\" For the film version, directed by Robert Zemeckis, the setting is changed to Hollywood, 1947, in an imaginary alternative where humans and animated cartoon characters exist together in the movie business. Bob Hoskins stars as an alcoholic gumshoe with a grudge against toons who is hired to investigate the activities of a cartoon star named Roger Rabbit. When the owner of the town where the toons live is found murdered and Roger Rabbit is framed, the gumshoe finds himself reluctantly teeming up with him to try and solve the case, which becomes much more complex than one might expect from a movie blending live action with animation.The first impression I got was that this movie would be directed at kids, but it is actually more fun for adults. Partially because of some dark undertones, but mostly because adults can really appreciate the craftsmanship and will wonder the most on how the filmmakers could have done it. Of course, this was not the first time animation was combined with live action, but this was the first time it had been done so effectively. For example, when a cartoon character steps on a floorboard, the (live-action) floorboard squeaks. When a toon touches a coat, the (live-action) coat moves. When they pick up a gun, the (live-action) gun moves. The camera is constantly in motion; the shadows are ever-present. And no matter how hard you look, you can't spot any wires or strings or operators and you find yourself wondering if that was even how it was done.That's the magic of \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\" Not merely because the special effects are good, but because they are done with the intent of amazing and befuddling the audience. You can guess how about half of the special effects were done. You'll probably be right about half the time there. And as for the other half, you can't even guess. And at the same time, you don't want to know because it's more fun to wonder.However, there is much more here to give people reason to see the movie. Mr. Zemeckis was reportedly given more than 40 scripts to choose from and chose one that is complex, whimsical, funny, imaginative, and nostalgic. The plot is much darker and more complex that you'd expect, the jokes are not the typical below-the-belt humor we usually get, the writing is witty and sharp, and every gag delivers a laugh. Furthermore, the casting choice as far as the humans go is solid. The great Bob Hoskins plays his role like a straight man and not a comical figure trying to upstage his animated costars. There are many other great choices as well, but most entertaining is that the movie has one of the most fun villains in cinema history. Christopher Lloyd gives one of his performances as a sardonic, gargoyle-like judge who is both fearsome and yet strangely entertaining at the same time.Some of the animated characters are new, but many come from our childhood memories. Different characters from different studios make their way into the film. Some of which haven't been seen on the screen in years, such as Betty Boop, who was last seen in 1939. A personal favorite scene of mine is where Donald and Daffy Duck have a little piano square-off. Not only is the combination of animated characters and live-action pianos seamless, but it is handly exremely well and the nostalgia that was bubbling through my conscience was intoxicating.Perfectly matched to Director Zemeckis and produced by passionate souls such as Steven Spielberg, \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is a first-class example of entertainment. Hollywood rarely even finds the nerve to try and attempt a movie like this anymore, but we are so appreciative of them when they do.",

            "content": "This innovative live action/traditional animation crossover was a massive success, released back when I was just under two years old, but I don't recall ever even hearing of it until 2005, around the time I first saw 2003's \"Looney Tunes: Back in Action\", another live action/cartoon crossover, which I really hated! I watched that film's predecessor, \"Space Jam\", for the first time last year and found it to be hit-and-miss, and then watched the 2003 Looney Tunes film again, which I didn't think was as bad the second time, but still below average. I had high expectations for \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" when I rented it this year, still having never seen it before, and it didn't turn out to be as good as I thought it would be, but still better than both Looney Tunes movies.In 1947, in a world where cartoon characters are real beings, interacting with live humans, acting out cartoons in front of the camera, and living in a place near Hollywood called Toontown, Roger Rabbit is a popular cartoon character who hasn't been doing so well on set lately. This is because it is believed that his human cartoon wife, Jessica, might be cheating on him. A bitter detective named Eddie Valiant is hired to investigate. He sees Jessica playing patty-cake with Toontown owner Marvin Acme and takes pictures. Roger is very upset when he learns about this. Soon after he finds out, Marvin is found murdered, and Roger is the prime suspect! At the scene of the crime, Eddie meets Judge Doom, who is with his Toon Patrol of cartoon weasels, and has created a substance which can kill cartoon characters! The detective soon finds the cartoon rabbit hiding in his office/apartment. Roger claims he is innocent, and Eddie finds himself reluctantly helping him, trying to clear his name and find the real culprit! The beginning of this film shows Roger Rabbit shooting a cartoon with fellow cartoon character Baby Herman. With this intro, it's off to a promising start, but soon after this cartoon sequence ends, the film goes downhill for a while. I'm not exactly sure why, but there were parts I found pretty dull, mostly early in the film. There were times when I laughed at this point, but maybe not enough. I also wasn't sure what I thought of Judge Doom, played by Christopher Lloyd. However, I later found that the 1988 blockbuster improves again, maybe starting with the part where Eddie finds Roger hiding in his bed. This leads to a lot of funny chaos in the room, including Roger and Eddie handcuffed together, and Eddie having to hide Roger under the sink water when the Toon Patrol come in! Many big laughs follow, with the title character's antics and such, and in addition to the humour, there's also a lot of suspense in the story. Being a live action/cartoon crossover, the film's cast features both live actors and voice actors, and both of these are generally good here. The blend of live action and animation was also done very well for this film. \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is a little overlong, which I really found during the climax, but this is not enough to ruin the movie.Before watching this, I knew that even though it was considered a family movie, it certainly wasn't squeaky clean. There is some sexuality, much of it involving Jessica Rabbit, with her cleavage and risqu\u00e9 moves, and there's also some mild language and some scenes which little kids could find too scary. It's one of those films that people might debate over whether it's REALLY a family film or not. Unlike some people, I never saw it as a kid, so I don't know what that would have been like. People can keep debating over whether kids should watch \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" or not, but it seems to have entertained many of them (maybe mostly older ones) in the past 22 years. Many adults clearly like it as well, perhaps largely for different reasons than kids. After watching it, I don't think it's the amazing piece of entertainment that so many other people claim it is, but it still gets my recommendation.",

The charming story of a mistreated young boy discovering his true purpose in life has demonstrated how media influence and positive good will can charm audiences of any ages and much must be said for this film.Having viewed this for the first time yesterday I sat and enjoyed a story regarding cartoons living in a world dominated by miserable humans. Like Potter, it takes a fantasy ideology and implements them into the real world, making it somewhat believable. We could all be Muggles or we could all see cartoons walking down the street. What brought this film to my attention was many reviews proclaiming this as one of the best family films ever created. Certainly the idea of this film puts it with the best, but if like me you have seen countless films of family entertainment over the years its not too difficult to see where this film is heading.Bob Hoskins, in a pretty conventional role, spends the whole film frowning and drinking, Christopher Lloyd (almost distinguishable) portrays a hard nosed negative villain and the obvious love interest is decoded through a fairly blank portrayal by Joanna Cassidy.Whilst there may be a formula to all this negative energy in way of the story, there is some light hearted revelations in way of the cartoons.The geeky and absurd Roger Rabbit acts completely bonkers that will generate laughs with viewers of a young age whilst older viewers, particularly guys, will enjoy the Jessica Rabbit encoding. Kathleen Turner's seductive voice has won many fans over but the animation of Jessica, the slim figure, long hair and positive and suggestive movements are hardly forgettable.The story revolves around Bob attempting to earn cash but when he gets Roger in trouble he must attempt to resolve the case of his framing. Whilst the plot moves along at a respectable pace using humour and familiar crime detective movements, it gives off a positive enjoyable ride.Zemeckis has created an astonishing ideology by juxtaposing humans with cartoons that have been worked through a tough process to generate a real world feeling. There are no awkward dialogue timings or cinematic mistakes of deception, everything fits together to create a foundation of realism.This is an enjoyable picture that uses this concept to generate the most laughs between humans and animations and whilst the conclusion is inevitable and the performances are fairly ordinary it is a good family entertainment picture.",

He is asked by animation film maker RK Maroon to trail cartoon owner Marvin Acme, who owns \"Toon Town\" and take incriminating pictures of him to show to a popular yet hapless cartoon rabbit by name of Roger (RK is Roger's boss and lately Roger can't seem to concentrate). The subject of the pictures: Roger's ravishing red haired wife Jessica (voice of an unbilled Kathleen Turner) with Marvin Acme! This understandably rattles Roger, who thinks his wife is \"Betty Crocker\", even though she happens to be a sultry singer at the Ink & Paint Club. But when Marvin turns up dead, Bob is forced to help Roger find the real culprit when Roger is believed to be the killer, which clashes with his image as the hapless straight man/rabbit to the crude, cigar chomping yet adorable cartoon character Baby Herman. But who IS the real culprit and why did they do it? And can Bob solve the case and save Roger before he is destroyed by the inhuman Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) and his cartoon Weesles?\nLoaded with gags, in joke references to both 1940s cartoons and the film noir private eye detective films that starred Humphrey Bogart, and making an almost seamless blend between live action actors and animated figures, this is one of the most entertaining pieces to come along in the history of cinema. Bob Hoskins holds his own admirably while playing 2nd fiddle to the hapless Roger and his cartoon pals.",

In 'Death' it was a Burton/Hitchcock idea.  With 'Gump', American history/sentimentality.  Here he tries a cartoon/noir/comedy and goofs it up.Perhaps he became too good so he went on to the weaker efforts 'Contact', 'What Lies...', and 'Cast Away'.  Why does it fail?  Maybe the first problem lies with the script, after all 'The Grinch' and 'Wild Wild West' weren't the brightest of efforts.  Arthur Schmidt knows Zemeckis, and his editing isn't bad because it knows the pace. Charles Campbell's sounds and Dean Cundey's photography are right, so what's wrong?I'd say it's the environment.  We never accept the noirish settings of Beverly Hills and toon town, so it doesn't fit our expectations.

Until one night in toon town when a mysterious character killed his brother by dropping a piano on his head, after that moment he decided to never work for toons again. That is until cartoon film maker R.K. Maroon hires him for a dirty job; to snap some compromising pictures of Jessica Rabbit to prove to Roger Rabbit they shouldn't be together. It's a simple start to the story, but it soon evolves into a plot of twists and corruption.The film is a great blend of genres, principally it's a film noir meets animation. Detective Valiant is the archetypal detective embroiled in a case much deeper than he first thought, Jessica Rabbit is the seductive temptress (Hey, she isn't bad, she was just drawn that way), and of course there is a murder to solve. It's all there, and more. There is a blend of zany cartoon comedy and adult humour, much of it is derived from gags on the animated characters themselves, you know Betty Boop not doing too well since they started drawing in colour! The opening scene could force most adults to turn the movie off within seconds if you wasn't aware of what was to follow, but give it a few minutes and you're introduced to a unique version of seedy 1947 Hollywood. On a technical level it's impressive. For a movie made in 1988 the cartoons blend in well enough, they aren't perfect but they aren't bad. When Valiant actually enters Toon Town it's a bit rough around edges, but you can forgive this given the age it was made in. What the film really excels in is the interactions the characters have with the toons, a lot of praise has to go to the actors for this. I can imagine how difficult it must be to carry a conversation with thin air, but Bob Hoskins manages to react to Roger Rabbit convincingly throughout the whole film. Christopher Lloyds Judge Doom deserves a mention to, he is possibly one of the creepiest villains I've seen, and at the climax of the film when the little twist to his character is revealed he becomes a genuinely scary sight. For some reason, the films ambitious concept and merging of genres just seems to work. Its fun and tongue in cheek nature mixed with its darker side make for a unique experience. 7/10",

When Eddie discovers a motive that no toon would kill Acme for, he teams up with Roger to hopefully bring the real murderer to justice.Robert Zemeckis, who brought us the amazing Back to the Future Trilogy, does another amazing job directing. The writers did a remarkable job working in jokes and zany anecdotes that somehow make total sense in a cartoon/real world crossover. The actors are very convincing; it's as if they are really interacting with toons. Considering that this movie was released in 1988, the animation/live action crossover is excellent; you really believe that the toons are manipulating the \"real\" environment. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a joy to watch \u2013 I can't think of how it could be any better. I don't know of another movie like it that actually reaches the standards of this film, it is simply superb.If you ever get a chance to watch this movie (again, or for the first time) don't turn it down. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

            "content": "Who Framed Roger Rabbit doesn't have a question mark at the end, because it's supposed to be bad luck. And that's what you'll have if you don't see this film.Private dick Eddie Valient (Bob Hoskins) works in a Hollywood-esqe place, nex to \"Toon Town\", where cartoons live. His brother was killed by a toon, and Eddie never found out who did it. So he hasn't gone near Toon Town since. But when he takes pictures for R.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern), owner of Maroon Cartoons, where Roger Rabbit works, of Roger's wife Jessica (an uncredited Kathleen Turner) playing patty-cake with rival cartoon maker Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye). Soon Acme is dead, and everyone thinks Roger did it. But only Eddie knows the truth.Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a landmark film, put simply. The combination of live-action and animation is perfect; sometimes you don't even know that the toons aren't real! When sparks fly, you see the punches hit the animated guys; it's a perfect set. Most of the time, animated films don't get nominated for any Oscars. Who Framed Roge Rabbit got three and an honorary one.But be warned, this is not really a kid's film. Sure, it's got Roger Rabbit, Daffy Duck, Mickey Mouse, and everyone else from the WB and Disney shows, but its plot is so intricate, the kiddos will just be waiting for the next character. Keep in mind, a lot of the time there is a cartoon character in screen, and there is a visit to Toon Town, but they won't be able to follow the plot (I'm still not sure if I get it!).The characters are well-developed, even if they are intoduced only for this movie and are \"unknowns\". Hoskins is very good as drunk Valient, his ability to interact with \"other actors\" is pretty good (or scary, take your pick). Christopher Lloyd, one of my favorite actors, is great as Judge Doom. Try comparing him to himself in 1985 in Back to the Future. See a giant difference? I do, at least.To sum it all up, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a marvelous achievement of animation blended with reality with terrific performances with lots of humor spreaded into it to make a fine, healthy picture that gets better every time you see it.My rating: 8/10Rated PG for some language, cartoon violence, and hard-to-follow plot",

But the adult themes within, especially like how Jessica is portrayed and the alcoholism are something you don't expect to see these days anymore. That said, I'm not watching it as a kid so I can appreciate the humor in it.Technically, this is a STUNNING movie, every scene with the toons will have you questioning how they did it. The animation is top notch, it is exceptionally smooth. We get the whole scala of toons to see, Mickey mouse, Bugs Bunny, you name it. Mostly consist of very short segments, with Roger and Jessica taking the main show. There's also a bunch of mentions and shots taken at the current state of the industry back then, and the world (Judge Doom's monologue).Music is pretty good overall but not as memorable as I'd hoped except for the last song which is great. There were very little sentimental segments, stuff to pull at the heart strings, which kept the movie lighthearted but imo it could've used more drama.Pacing wise it starts somewhat slow, picks up nicely, but the final warehouse showdown overstays it's welcome a bit too much and felt somewhat slow at times to me. Plot is very simple, murder mystery but it's yelling in your face who the killer is. Though the final twist I didn't see coming, though it didn't change much.Absolutely filled with slapstick humor, like the cartoons, done really well. Though to me, not something that makes me laugh anymore. Just a couple dialog lines made me laugh a bit.Generally though, just for the combination of animation and real world interaction / action it's a must watch. By this point it's a classic.",

Let me put it this way, I have worn the tape out so much that I had to get it on Laser Disc.  This movie is set in 1947 in L.A. and Toontown (the home of all beloved cartoon characters).  I'm sure that you have read the previous ones and know what this little gem is about, but I'll go ahead and give you a little bit of the story...  Eddie Valiant (private detective) hasn't had a case in YEARS...  Until R.K. Maroon (Roger's boss) gives him the task of taking pictures of his star's wife playing patty cake (literally) with Marvin Acme (owner of the company that gives Wile E. Coyote headaches). Eddie shows Roger the pictures, Roger gets fumed and leaves the office. The next day, Marvin Acme has been found murdered in his factory and the evidence points to Roger...  That's all I'm going to tell.  I'll let you find out for yourselves.  Jessica Rabbit, (Roger's Rabbit's wife) is a human toon WOMAN.  Maybe an odd couple, but they seriously love and adore each other.  I REALLY love this film and it will always be #1 in my heart.  I'm really saddened that there will be no more cartoons and movies of this beloved couple :( (that's why I went to see Honey, I Shrunk The Kids; Dick Tracy; and A Far Off Place!)  I was looking forward to new cartoons of Roger, Jessica and Baby Herman (and hopefully more appearances of Benny the Cab), but I guess I'll have to settle for what's already done.  It's a shame such a fresh idea has to be omitted slowly by time.  I think that the actors did a FANTASTIC JOB.  Who else can pull this off besides imaginative children?  GREAT IMAGINATIVE ACTORS!!  I have both books- Who Censored Roger Rabbit (loved it) and Who P-P-P-Plugged Roger Rabbit(some questions, but entertaining.)  I loved these characters so much that I am in the process of writing about them.  I won't share details!  Thanks Gary Wolf for bringing these 'Toons into my life!  I rate this movie ten golden carrots out of ten!!!  If you love this film, read the books!  Look for a new book from Gary Wolf (not Roger related) near Christmas of 2003 (hopefully).  The movie is 104 minutes and some content may not be very appropriate for the little ones.

This is a truly original movie which combines live action with animation, and the result looks incredible. Bob Hoskins gives what has got to be the funniest performance of his career as a private detective who gets involved with cartoon character Roger Rabbit when the hyperactive toon is framed for murder. Director Robert Zemeckis has repeatedly said that \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" was the most difficult movie he's ever made, and by the looks of it, I can easily see why. He did an excellent job with the live action part of the movie (like when a toon is holding a real gun; in reality it's a real gun hanging on a wire). He was unfairly overlooked by Oscar voters; he should have gotten an Oscar nomination for Best Director (six years later Zemeckis got revenge; he made \"Forrest Gump\" which he got nominated for and won the Oscar as Best Director). The special effects (which did win the Best Visual Effects Oscar) are remarkable. The cartoon animation (by Richard Williams, who won a special Oscar for his work here) is spectacular. Everything about \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is perfect. It's a dazzling motion picture that will never be topped in the department of putting live action with animation together. A great movie.**** (out of four)",

            "content": "I'll never forget the first time I saw Who Framed Roger Rabbit. I was 6 years old. And so excited when I put the tape in the video-recorder. I knew about the way cartoons and flesh and blood people interacted with each other in this film, but I was completely unprepared for the experience I was to have.In one of the most ingenious openings for a film, it begins with a cartoon starring Roger Rabbit and Baby Herman. I actually believed it was a genuine cartoon. I had no idea the film had already begun. This cartoon in of itself is a treat. A classic scenario with Baby Herman trying to get to a jar of cookies, throughout the obstacle course of an ordinary kitchen. Roger meanwhile has to save him from the various kitchen knives, rolling pins and live electrical sockets. It's almost vintage Chuck Jones.But the cartoon comes to a halt when Roger has a fridge dropped on his head. And is seeing birds. Then a director yells CUT. A flesh and blood director. He barges onto the set and criticises Roger for blowing his lines again. He should be seeing stars. Not birds. Baby Herman drops his cute, innocent child routine and talks like a grizzled, veteran actor demanding to know what the hell was wrong with that take.I'd never seen anything like it. I felt like I'd been transported into a parallel world. And that's exactly what the filmmakers have tried to create. WFRR was directed by Robert Zemeckis. He already had two hits under his belt, Romancing the Stone and Back to the Future. And it was with BTTF he established his trademark as a director who could work in cutting edge special effects while at the same time telling a good story.With WFRR, Zemeckis accomplished the seemingly impossible task (at the time) of merging the cartoon logic of the animated world with the rules and conventions of the human world. Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins doing a credible American accent), a down on his luck private eye has been hired by Roger's boss, R. K. Maroon to spy on Roger's Toon wife, Jessica (voiced perfectly by an unbilled Kathleen Turner). Rumours are flying around she's fooling about with Marvin Acme, the man who provides the gadgets and gimmicks for the studios cartoons. This is what's causing Roger to slip up in his routine.Valiant has had it in for Toons ever since his brother was killed by one in Toon Town, a sort of minority suburb for all the Toons. He has no wish to get involved, but for the right price he does. He trails Jessica to the Ink & Paint club where she is a singer. Valiant gets some pictures of her with Acme, and Roger goes berserk. The next day, Acme is found murdered, Roger is the prime suspect, and Judge Doom (a seriously creepy Christopher Lloyd) plans to execute him with the Dip, a substance that can actually kill Toons. With Roger running to Valiant for help, the two team up to find out who framed Roger Rabbit, and why.That description sounds like a typical film-noir plot, filled with deceit, corruption and femme fatales. But Who Framed Roger Rabbit is much more than that. This is an inspired masterpiece, filled with visual lunacy, smart in-jokes, a tightly plotted story and a lot of laughs. Bob Hoskins is perfect as the seedy gumshoe with a drink problem. He has the unenviable task of sharing most of the screen time with thin air, but he is not put off. In fact Hoskins was a real trooper with some of the things he was asked to do. His interactions with Roger are perfectly integrated, and there is even an odd sort of chemistry between the two.The film is not always about the next sight gag (even though they're always clever and welcome). There are subtle moments too, such as the scene when Valiant is telling Roger about his brother's death, or Roger trying to get Valiant to lighten up. The characterisation exists for both human and Toon. There are numerous references to every type of Warner Bros and Disney cartoon imaginable. That must have been quite a deal they struck, with characters like Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse sharing screen time, or Donald Duck and Daffy Duck sharing a marvellous piano duet that turns into a duel. Some of the references are quite subtle too, such as the penguin waiters from Mary Poppins and the crows from Dumbo appearing in the foreground. One of the joys of Roger Rabbit is just looking out for the next Toon, such as a black and white Betty Boop struggling to find work now that cartoons have gone to colour. That's the first time I've ever felt true poignancy for a cartoon character. Which extends to Roger's plight as well.But the film never loses sight of it's plot. I won't reveal it for those who still haven't had the pleasure of experiencing this truly remarkable film. Another joy is watching the tortuous plot gradually unfold, such as the scene where Valiant visits Toon Town, a neat reversal on the rest of the film. It all ends brilliantly in a gripping climax at the Acme Factory, that combines action, suspense and a lot of slapstick.This is one of the great comedies of our time. A true classic that will be remembered for years to come. And absolutely perfect for those who have never experienced the delirious joys of cars driving cars, or swords who sing like Sinatra.That's all folks!",

It combines live action and animation in a blend that made it match up to the fit of Disney's Mary Poppins which till date is Disney's most Oscar nominated film and it went home with 5 wins. Like Mary Poppins live action and animation combination that came out grand, so did this, although unlike Mary Poppins, where the animation and the characters hardly interact, in this movie they seem to be always around each other.This interaction was so well done that you have to give kudos to the animators and animation directors.The movie plot is about a cartoon star Roger Rabbit whose wife was caught on camera by a P.I. Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) playing pattycake with another man. That man soon ends up dead and Roger is being accused for the murder. Now Roger has no hope but to run to the toon hating P.I. Eddie who took the pictures in the first place, now both are stuck together as they try to figure out why someone will be trying to frame Roger Rabbit.The screenplay is written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (who also worked together on Dr' Seuss screenplay adaptation of How The Grinch Stole Christmas (2000)) and is based on Gary K. Wolf's 1981 novel named Who Censored Roger Rabbit? Both book and movie depict a world in which cartoon characters interact directly with human beings.Who Framed Roger Rabbit won 4 Oscars and it was a critical acclaim, many enjoyed the comic and the fun story the movie carries and at the time of its production it was one of the most expensive animations ever made. Its production cost was 70 million dollars and it was a box office success making over 320 million in its time of release.In conclusion, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a classic animation from the 80s that all should get the chance to see even if it is just once. Talks are going about that Disney is in talks with Amblin (Steven Spielberg) and even director Robert Zemeckis to make a sequel to this fine film, although Bob Hoskins has retired from acting, I feel that the writers can still come up with something we all want to see.www.lagsreviews.com",

            "content": "Whenever I watch Who Framed Roger Rabbit? I always remember the words of R. Fiore, reviewing the film for The Comics Journal: \"When you see a man walk on water, you don't complain that he gets his pants cuffs wet.\" I also remember going to see the film for the first time, with my girlfriend and her son (the same team that went to watch The Princess Bride) one Sunday morning at the old Odeon in Manchester, one of the last few films I saw on a properly big screen.There's a case to say that this is one of those films that is at its best on first viewing, despite the immense level of detail that's only observable on repeated viewings (for instance: I don't remember catching a background shot of the Seven Dwarves, pickaxes on shoulders, emerging from a subway station, before today). That's because the film starts with something that, no matter how pre-warned you have been, you cannot visually comprehend until you see it.The opening of the film is a cartoon, straightforward, line-drawn cartooning in the classic style. It's presented as an R. K. Maroon Studio cartoon (nod to Bugs Bunny there), with an introduction loudly echoes the Warner Brothers shorts and a 'storyline' firmly built on a Tom and Jerry-esque sequence of domestic disasters. It's supposed to be the latest in a series pairing Baby Herman and Roger Rabbit, one a baby innocently getting himself into dangerous situations, the other his babysitter, getting serious slapstick punishment saving the baby from danger.It's highly reminiscent of the classic style, though it lacks something of the tightness of the works of Chuck Jones or Tex Avery, and the underlying premise (a rabbit for a babysitter?) lacks the logic of the best cartoons (Tom and Jerry, Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd, Roadrunner and Coyote).But this is wet cuffs stuff, because after three minutes of this, a fridge drops on Roger's head, producing little bluebirds, flying around whistling, and an angry Director yells cut, the scene unfolds into three dimensional live action, Roger gets yelled out because the script called for stars, and if you were any kind of average, everyday person in 1988, your jaw is currently somewhere about the floor and the film has you in the palm of its hand and can do anything with you. Because you knew the film was about human beings and cartoons interacting with each other, and you might remember Uncle Remus singing \"Zip-a-dee-doo-dah\" or Gene Kelly dancing with Jerry Mouse, but never before had you seen it done so completely, so comprehensively, so unbelievably real.After that, you don't really need a story. Just watching the impossible will do to keep you in your seats for the rest of the film, especially as the film offers several moments that are a vintage cartoon fan's wet dream, the stuff of which private fantasies are made, because for a golden moment, rights have been acquired that put Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny on scree together in the same scene and, more glorious than that and, thrown in early on to blow away any residual resistance, a scene with Daffy Duck and Donald Duck competing in playing pianos (though apparently the original sequence was storyboarded by none other than Chuck Jones himself, who savagely criticised Film Director Robert Zemeckis for ruining it by insisting on directing it himself instead of leaving it to Animation Director Robert Williams).The story is pretty simple. Embittered and alcoholic Private Eye Eddie Valiant (played to near perfection by Bob Hoskins, whose only failing is that on a couple of occasions his American accent slips) is hired to investigate claims that Jessica Rabbit (voiced by an uncredited Kathleen Turner: boy, that woman could vamp!) is stepping out on Roger with Marvin Acme, the gag king and owner of Toontown, the (un)real estate where the Toons come from. Eddie gets the evidence and Marvin gets a safe dropped on his head. Roger is the prime suspect and turns to Eddie to save him from the frame. Eddie swore off representing Toons after one killed his brother Teddy five years ago but won't take being played for a patsy. The whole thing is a get rich plot by the soon-to-retire Judge Doom, whose jurisdiction covers Toontown. Freeways are coming and the Judge foresees getting very rich off service industries serving motorists: he plans to wipe Toontown off the map, and the Toons with it, to build the first.As plots go, it's simple. It's an affectionate spoof of a classic film form, without being any deeper than it need be to let us wallow in the idea of a world in which Toons exist side-by-side with us. There are enough references and cameos here to keep a cartoon buff happy for years, whilst providing an equal amount of fun to the less committed audience, who only want to be reminded of the fun they had as kids.Basically, it's Disney and Warner Brothers and outside of that there's not much more. Betty Boop, originated by Fleisher Studios and owned by Harvey Films since 1958, has a scene with Eddie, Tex Avery's Droopy, created for MGM plays a lift attendant, but Screwy Squirrel (also Avery) only gets a mention and Woody Woodpecker gets an unportrayed and unnamed laugh. And to be honest, the original characters created for the film aren't up to the level of the 'performers' who fill in the spaces: I have to say that, a dozen viewings along, I am finding the hypercrazy Roger and his \"p-p-p-p-p-please\" a tad irritating. But we're back at the trouser cuffs again.Christopher Lloyd as the forbidding Judge is also superb, with his air of cartoon menace overlaid onto genuine human greed and malice. Like Hoskins, he was far from the first choice, and Tim Curry was considered very seriously until Disnet decided he was just too scary (you can certainly see that). They're the only two principal human roles, with Turner bringing Jessica to admirably subtle OTT life, and Charles Fleisher (sadly, no relation of Max Fleisher) as Roger.I'm going to take one last trip to the cuffs and echo one aspect of the film that not so much jarred as mildly irritated even when I first watched the film and which everybody attributed to the involvement of Steven Spielberg as Executive Producer, and that's the portrayal of the Toons as creatures that exist to make people laugh, which is not a problem in itself until it's tied to the quasi-deification of laughter as a cure-all for the world.But Who Framed Roger Rabbit? simply has too much in it and going for it for these to be anything but quibbles, easily ignorable. From that moment when 2D cartooning becomes 3D like you and me, we are walking on water, and if film special effects are even better yet thirty years later, who cares? And it preserves some of the very last work of Mel Blanc, and is all the more special for that.",

All the while I was wondering why Roger couldn't at least get a trial, but I guess L.A. doesn't bother with such trivialities in this universe. Doom has a squad of thugs at his disposal, several gum shoe-accented weasels wearing double-breasted suits and fedoras.I understand that combining live action with animation was groundbreaking when this came out, and in fact the movie won a special achievement Oscar for it, but it's hard to be impressed in the era of Pixar. Today it all comes off as a little dated, but I suppose it doesn't hurt for nostalgia's sake.",

            "content": "\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is one of those rare films (\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" and \"Cannibal! The Musical\" come to mind) that create their own genres for the simple reason it's impossible to fit them into anything existing.Raymond Chandler meets Tex Avery?  \"Chinatown\" with a twist of \"Red Hot Riding Hood\"?  Or even hidden commentary on racism in mid 20th Century America? (What the cartoon characters are called, \"toon,\" rhymes with a racist term.)  Arguments could be made regarding all these things, but I'd just rather sit back and enjoy the damned film!I don't think animation ever looked so full and rich, even in the days of classic \"full\" animation.  The cartoon characters interaction with humans seems credible because the toons cast shadows and are drawn to have depth. The beauty of the animation is another factor making this so wonderful a movie.The range of voices doing those characters is also remarkable: David L. Lander, June Foray, Mel Blanc, Pat Buttram, and Frank Sinatra, not to mention the three main ones, Charles Fleischer (Roger and Benny the Cab), Lou Hirsch (Baby Herman) and Kathleen Turner as Jessica.  And, lest we forget, perhaps the most memorable turn, Mae Questyl in the last time she'd ever voice Betty Boop (and the first time she'd done so in over 50 years).Of course, the human actors are no slouches, either.  Despite the light nature of this film, Bob Hoskins's performance as Eddie Valiant ranks with his best work.  Christopher Lloyd is also the very embodiment of evil as the appropriately named Judge Doom.  And Joanna Cassidy voices the most \"un-family film-like\" line in the movie (\"Tell me, Eddie, is that a rabbit in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?\") with all the world-weary non-chalance it deserves.Speaking of Judge Doom, I'd like to voice my own opinion about a mystery of the movie. At the end of the film it's revealed that Judge Doom is the toon who killed Eddie's brother in disguise, but which toon he is isn't ever revealed. \nI think Judge Doom was supposed to be Popeye.Why?  When the steam-rollered Judge Doom re-inflates himself with compressed air, his fake eyes \"pop\" out.  He also has the ability to morph his fist into dangerous things like anvils and buzz saws, much like Popeye does after eating spinach.  Popeye is also one of the few classic cartoon characters absent from the film, making him a prime candidate to be Doom.  Of course, Doom's toon has a high-sqeaky voice and _two_ red eyes, but I think these are miscues to get one off the trail.Why would they make Judge Doom be Popeye?  My understanding is in the original script of \"Roger Rabbit,\" Popeye was supposed to appear along with Bluto as one of Marvin Acme's pallbearers.  But Kings Features Syndicate, who owned the rights to the character, wanted too much money to let Popeye to be added to the film, so the script was changed.  Did Zemeckis want to sneak Popeye back in, especially as a villain, to show his displeasure with Kings Features' uncooperativeness?Just a theory, and one that doesn't have to be accepted to enjoy this unique, masterful, and endlessly lovable film.",

Perhaps the most intriguing thing about Roger Rabbit is that the film is surprisingly dark for a children's film, and it has loads of humor and the plot is magnificent. The acting is all but perfect and the animation is spectacular. The villain is cartoonish and evil and surprisingly poses a huge threat to all of the toons. You really get a spooky feeling of dread throughout the film, while it still manages to be fresh, light-hearted, and filled to the brim with humor.It was copied many, many times in such films as Looney Tunes: Back in Action, but nothing ever came close to the genius that is Who Framed Roger Rabbit?",

Ostensibly directed by Robert Zemeckis, his presence is barely felt, overwhelmed by both the special effects and the overload of famous cartoon characters interacting with humans in this noir-ish fantasy of a forties Hollywood bordered by a ghetto populated with the animated characters of the period, used by the studios as a work force and treated as second-class citizens. Zemeckis' anonymity isn't much of a problem as the sheer ambition and comprehensiveness of the project makes it all giddily worthwhile; you can't stop loving the seamless mix of live and animated action. That said, the film is a bit too fast-paced and needlessly confusing and lead Bob Hoskins, as the private detective hired to investigate the murder of a human by `toon' Roger Rabbit, doesn't always acquit himself well, trying too hard to hide his British accent and embarrassingly made to act the buffoon towards the end. It's easy to see why the film can be considered a classic while Roger Rabbit himself remains far from legendary: as voiced by Charles Fleischer (who also voices several other characters as well), he's annoying, unfunny and instantly forgettable. Much more memorable are the characters of his sexy wife, Jessica (voiced by Kathleen Turner) and Christopher Lloyd as the villainous Judge Doom--they're delightfully tacky, carefully crafted and have a complexity that Roger fails to deliver. Many of the cartoon cameos are voiced by their original actors, including Mae Questel (as Betty Boop) and Mel Blanc (as most of the Warner Brothers representatives).",

We find out when the filming for the cartoon ends that Roger just can't get his lines right and is kicked off of the set, Much to the onlooking eyes of private detective Eddie Valiant played by Bob Hoskins.Eddie later gets a case that will pay for his very large bar tab by his boss R.K. Maroon played by Alan Tilvirn head owner of Maroon Cartoons to find out if Marvin Acme played by Stubby Kaye is having relations with Jessica Rabbit voiced by Kathleen Turner Roger Rabbits Wife.Eddie takes pictures of Marvin and Jessica literally playing Pattycake and shows the photos to Roger. After a sip of Scotch Roger runs away into the night and Eddie passes out in his office.The next morning Eddie is told that Marvin Acme has been Murdered by Roger and go to the scene of the crime to see what happened. Marvin had a safe dropped on his head and the paint from Rogers glove is on the rope. After meeting with Judge Doom played by Christopher Lloyd who can actually kill toons by dropping them in \"Dip\", Eddie goes back to his apartment to find Baby Herman There. Bbay Herman tells Eddie that Marvin Acme had a will entitling ToonTown to the toons, but nobody can find it.The next day Roger appears in Eddies office because he is a wanted man. The Toon patrol which is a group of 5 weasels come to Eddies house looking for the Rabbit.After causing a mishap at a bar Roger and Eddie go to a movie theater and Eddie reveals that his brother Teddy was killed by a toon dropping a piano on hi head. They then see a newsreel saying that R.K. Maroon wanted to kill Marvin Acme by blackmailing him. Marron is then shot twice and Eddie leaves and heads into ToonTown.After it is revealed that Doom killed Maroon Eddie and Jessica Set out to find him but get captured. Roger, being worried, goes on his search for them.At the Acme Factory Judge Doom says that He wants to not only own ToonTown but get rid of it so he can build a freeway.

After Judge Doom gets run over by a steam roller, He reveals himself to be the one that killed Acme and Eddies Brother. Ediie decides to kill him with his own creation, Judge Doom Gets Dipped, The Toons find Acmes will, And Eddie gets his sense of humor back.This is a fantastic film. It does so well with combining live action with animation, it has great Humor, the story while dark is great, and it is the only time you will see Donald Duck and Daffy Duck together on screen, and the only time you will see Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny on screen together. However this should have gotten a PG-13 Rating because of the Sexual Content and the violence. I mean how does getting shot and getting run over by a steam roller, even though there is not any blood, considered PG material? Still this remains a gem in my mind.Rated PG For Lnaguage, Violence, Sensuality And Frightening Images.1hr 44min/104 min.****/****",

It feels very close to the idea of Space Jam in both the good and bad aspects. Now this actually was surprising to me that it was based off a actual book by Gary K. Wolf named \"Who Censored Roger Rabbit.\" In the book though, Roger is the one killed instead. It is unclear why they changed the story line a bit but I actually like this new idea better, making it have a little more suspense.When we get into the story line, it's a little odd because of how the main character was actually created as a mixture of many different cartoons in and of themselves. Roger has the nut shaped head like Tex Avery, red swatch of hair like Droopy, Overalls like Goofy, a bow tie like Porky Pig, gloves like Mickey Mouse, and cheeks and ears like Bugs Bunny. Even his personality is like Goofy and Daffy Duck in how he always seems to mess up.On the other hand, Eddie Valiant was a serious character, a private investigator who became a alcoholic when a toon killed his brother. There were many people who the producer wanted but I actually think that Bob Hoskins was the perfect choice in how he looks and acts. It makes him feel a bit more filled out as being the somewhat overweight and once in a while dopey looking private investigator.The animation is alright for the time it came out, the characters still look rather plastic and its like they tried to hard to make them look 3D. The only really good part of the animation in this is that when they get into toon town, at least they didn't op for the animated toon world rather then the flat panel that Cool World used.The voices are pretty good, though some of the normal cartoons sound pretty off when they get on stage. I don't think they had the right voice actors for the toons so got as close as they could.",

ANCHOR'S AWEIGH (1945), remember when Gene Kelly danced with Jerry the Mouse from Tom and Jerry. MARY POPPINS (1964) where Dick Van Dyke danced with animated Penguins. Not to mention BEDKNOBS and BROOMSTICKS (1971), where Angela Lansbury turns an animated lion into a rabbit. This movie perfected the technique and the art. Give it up to the great Richard Williams. Aw man this guy is awesome. His book, THE ANIMATOR'S SURVIAL KIT is a great book and he frequently references this movie he was involved in. Richard Williams nails the who's who of cartoons characters from various companies (such as Disney, Warner Brothers, Universal, MGM and Paramount not to mention lesser known ones), it's a shame that Popeye, Tom and Jerry, Little Lulu and Casper the Friendly Ghost didn't make it. Mr. Williams nailed not only Roger and Jessica Rabbit, but all the other characters given their proper 1947 look/style. It is fascinating and is worth it for the aspiring animator/animation student. Now going back, I say that this movie is funny and sugar-coated at first, and later it turns dark, dramatic and grim. No wonder this movie won an Oscar for Best Special Effects. To me, this was the KING KONG or STAR WARS of my childhood. All in all, it is a pretty good (family appropriate) movie. Kids will love it, adults will love it. There was planning for a sequel, but it didn't get made. Plus, this movie, akin to JAWS, KING KONG and STAR WARS, was imitated. In other words, studios made cash-in attempts, that looked nearly close to it. COOL WORLD (1992) starring Brad Pitt and Kim Basinger, with animation by Ralph Bakshi. EVIL TOONS (1992) starring David Carridine, is a Fred Olen Ray film that is the love child to EVIL DEAD and ROGER RABBIT. Sadly, the cartoon-animated beast gets a small amount of screen time and there is too much hot-girly action. I am glad that my parents didn't let me see THAT movie. Avoid it. Italy made VOLERE VOLARE (1991) by Guido Manuli and Maurizio Nichetti looks like what one critic said, \"ROGER RABBIT adult style\". However, there were no other movies that exploited the combination between live-action and animation (cartoon animation not CGI). Still, SPACE JAM (1996) and LOONEY TUNES BACK IN ACTION were the last films to do it. Please read my reviews of LOONEY TUNES BACK IN ACTION. With a movie like that (WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT or LOONEY TUNES BACK IN ACTION), it makes me wonder and think, \"Don't you wish they would make more movies like that?\" I highly recommend it. Rated PG for violence (normal and cartoony), mild language, and some sexual innuendo. This has been another \"Matthew Praises\". After you read it, don't you wish for more \"Praises\" instead of \"Rants?\"",

I found many of those parts pretty funny (like Baby Herman for instance. Some of the things that he did were pretty twisted :) ). Another thing that I loved about the movie was how they blended the real world with the cartoon world. They did an amazing job at that (and it was only the 80's before all that other advanced crap came in).It was a well done movie. This movie has been a part of my life for so long, it's unforgettable. And though I'm almost an adult, Roger's still my absolute favorite (and I still have the doll that I got more than ten years ago!). I would say that this movie is for BOTH adults and kids. The adults get the mystery and humor of it and the kids get the cartoons out of it (I would say Roger especially; he's more wackier and irrevolent than the other cartoons).

Elsewhere commentators have waxed about the technical brilliance of this movie, so I shall instead rave about the attention to details (the shadow of the Maltese Falcon in Valiant's office, the dead partner as in Spade & Archer of MF, the weasel's gangster movie patter) & the wonderful period feel (the tram cars, the bar, the studio lots).

            "content": "Who Framed Roger Rabbit, is a movie that took two different forms of media and entertainment and combined them together to create a seemingly new form of visual enjoyment. Roger, a suspicious cartoon rabbit is looking to find out the truth about his wife; when he employs Eddie Valiant, a detective, to get the skinny on what his wife is doing, and he finds himself in more trouble than ever expected. Before the investigation into his wife can take place, Roger becomes the prime suspect in the murder of Mr. Acme. The movie shows the trials and obstacles that Roger and Valiant have to overcome while trying to prove Roger's innocence. The theme of the movie is proving innocence. Roger may not like Mr. Acme for his involvement with his wife, but he is not the murdering type. The movie shows the theme throughout with the ongoing quest to prove Roger's innocence. The lighting adds to the mystery and secretive atmosphere of the film. There are many scenes that use low lighting and spotlighting under street lamps to give a very mysterious feel. This is one aspect that helps to tie the film together with the typical/classic detective movie. The angles in the film also help to show the importance of finding innocence for Roger. There are tight angles that help depict the secretive aspect of the film, while there are wide angles, especially during transitions into new scenes of the film. The title of this film does a great job of giving a first time viewer a snap shot of the theme and what to expect. The film title asks the question Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and the whole movie is the hunt for who framed him and finding his innocence. Even though Valiant starts the movie hating tunes, he is able to avenge his brother's death; by the end of the movie he has a turnaround about his hatred for tunes and there is a warm and fuzzy feeling that all is well with the world. This is a great movie that combines two classic movie genres and gives the viewer/audience the ability to experience something brand new. A movie that is similar to Who Framed Roger Rabbit is Gnomeo and Juliette. They share the theme of proving innocence; both of the main characters are trying to show they have not done anything wrong.",

I was first introduced to WFRR when I was very young. (Probably 5 or 6 years old.) And I don't remember much from it, but what I can recall for sure is that I did enjoy it. But now that I'm grown up, I actually enjoy it even more.It's a phrase we hear all the time and more often than not, it gives us false hope that the film will be exactly as it promises: \"Fun for the whole family!\" they tell us. But most of the time, movies that try to sell by using this title are false advertising and end up as unmemorable failures for both young and old audiences. But you can rest easy because this is not the case with WFRR.For starters, the tone of the story itself is a masterful combination of family friendly humour and dark euphemisms that are so complex they will go right over a child's head. So adults can appreciate them without fear of their kids becoming tainted by suggestive themes. It is perfectly equated in the light as well as the dark side of humanity. And that is something that is not easily achieved by an ordinary film, much less one that is partially geared towards children.There's a whole multitude of things that I could give this film praise for. To name the best ones: there's the skillful animation, the seamless interaction of the human characters with their toon counterparts, the clever themes of a classic 1940's film noir that blend absolutely beautifully with the cartoonist nature of the story, the top-notch acting from Bob Hoskins, Christopher Lloyd and others; and last but not least, the pain-staking amount of detail made to every single interaction between man and toon. Over all, the techniques used worked to excellence and don't fail to astound even by today's standards. You can almost feel the animator's blood, sweat and tears through every great effort to convince us that these toons are real and are just as human as their living, breathing co-stars.Because I consider the film to be so nearly perfect, there is very little that I could complain about (and I don't think I could even if I tried!). Sure, there are some scenes that might come off as a tad out-landish or zany but hey...that's the nature of cartoons. And when used in combination of brilliant acting that's so faultless to the point that you constantly forget that the actors on set are interacting with things that never actually existed; it gives you a better appreciation for cartoons and 2D animation in general but also for the extremely talented cast who gave it their all to make these gimmicks a success.As a whole, the film is staggering in both technical achievement and story. It has a lot of heart to it, great humour and a wonderfully crafted script. If you're looking for a film that both fully grown adults and small children will like, this is the real deal. There's no false advertisement to be found here; you don't get any more genuine than this. Everyone should give Who Framed Roger Rabbit a watch because you won't find more fun anywhere else!",

Well directed, a great cast of people animated and real, a good overall look/attitude that doesn't feel much like a childish \"cartoon\", and an in-depth and complex story for a film about a rabbit from Toon Town. Disney and Looney Toon fans rejoice, as this is what I would consider a one hit wonder that happens to also include Spielberg in the making. The drawn out characters in real life settings were expertly done especially with the lighting and the shadowing. When it comes to putting animated characters in a real life world and vise versa in an interesting and engaging story, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a gold mine of that type of genre such that it exists. I'm actually quite surprised that there isn't really any other movie like this one aside from Space Jam. This flick shall remain a rather large classic for 2D animation fans and for the people who just love animation in general in just about any time zone (like myself). There's nothing non-eye-catching about it for the most part.",

I always like to see Christopher Lloyd as a villain, and here he's at his over-the-top maniacal best. Of course, how could I not mention the effects? The toons fit seamlessly into the \"real world\", and Hoskins fits just as perfectly in Toon Town. Speaking of Toon Town, that is easily one of the best parts of the movie, filled with classic cameos, great effects, and hilarious gags.

So many animation/live-action hybrids have happened before this movie and many tried to capture the success of this movie, but none of them will live up to the masterpiece that is Who Framed Roger Rabbit. The techniques to how they've combined live action footage and animation under the brilliant direction of Robert Zemeckis and Richard Williams is astounding, especially how they did not use the computer technology we have today. Not only that, but the fact that you see all your favorite cartoon characters that have stood the test of time all in this one film. Right down to having Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny together at the same time, the likes of this kind of crossover will never be seen again. Even without those gimmicks, the movie is still an incredibly funny, heartwarming story about a man learning to stop taking out his depression in unhealthy ways and how to laugh again. The characters are lovable and unforgettable, the story is engaging and tightly-woven together, the music is great, and of course, the animation is groundbreaking. If you are fan of animation, this is mandatory viewing. Even if you're just a casual film fan, this is still worth a watch just to see what it's all about.

Now I can realize just how great this film is. First off I love classic cartoons. I mean who doesn't. They are entertaining to kids, and adults can't deny that they love them too. Now imagine every and I mean every cartoon character you can think of from the golden age of animation in one film. Don't think it's possible? Think again. This film has everyone, and they even have WB and Disney characters in the same scenes together. It feels like a segregation of cartoon characters stopped and now we see everybody together. There is a hilarious scene with Daffy and Donald, and the two big guys from Disney and WB are in a scene together. It is simply amazing and it is a great feeling that will never truly be recaptured. As for the plot it is much more than just a near 2 hour cartoon short. It is a mystery, a thriller, a romance, as well as a great comedy. You really do get attached to the characters, and you get wrapped up in the mystery. It is a very well written story. Then there is the groundbreaking effects. When I was small I never thought about all the stuff the filmmakers had to do to do some of the stuff that happens in this movie. There is an ocean's worth of creativity involved. If you haven't seen these kinds of things done before you will have your jaw drop. \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is a work of genius. It revolutionized cinema and it is still inspiring to this day.4 stars out of 4",

But this is a modernized form of it in which they probably used computers.  But enough about the animation!  I thought Bob Hoskins was wonderful as the boozehound Eddie Valient who was hired by cartoon producer R.K. Maroon to solve a mystery.  The title character, Roger was hilarious. And let's not forget Baby Herman (he's a baby, but has a grown man's voice). We also have the different cartoon stars like Yosemite Sam, Mickey Mouse, and Betty Boop (who was jeleous of Roger's wife Jessica because she was in color).  I liked the scene with Donald and Daffy Duck playing the pianos. It was so funny.

Of course today we may detects some minor errors, but still it's a movie far ahead of it's time.Ofrcourse I have to point out, it's not exactly a movie for small children, this is for the adults, and teenager for that sake. The movie has it's obvious PG rating because of it's obvious references to sex, some very mild violence. And let's face it,the movie is about a Toon being framed for murder. Let's just say I wouldn't advice you to show to anyone younger than 10 or 9.The movie takes place in 1947, and is based on the idea, what if Toons were actors rather than just drawings. The Toons work for the film studios in L.A. but live in ToonTown, sort of like a mixture of a ghetto and a magical dimension. Let's just say, Toons don't have the same right as humans, since they're technically just drawings. The story basically is about he Toon Roger Rabbit who is framed for murder, and the private detective Eddie Valiant played by Bob Hoskins, who resent Toons for having killed his brother a few years back, is forced the clear his name. I won't spoil more so I'll just say that.Bob Hoskins interacting with characters that we all know isn't really there is just amazing. And how the Toons interact with the environment is even more stunning. Of course today, when we are used to CGI and such, finding some few mistakes now and then isn't hard. But believe this, after 10 minutes of this film, you'll stop looking, and who cares if there's a few mistakes the film is from 1988, it was way ahead of it's time.So if you're a fan of classic cartoons, or just want laughs and excitement and haven't seen this film; what are you waiting for, buy it, rent it whatever, just see it now. i give this movie a 10/10.",

It's just I've never had a chance to review it so don't wonder that I've never seen this or the classic Jaws just now! Especially not Jaws that I have seen countless times. Now this is a wonderful most original film yet it could have been extended. Anyone knows that yet it is still the enchanted, original, ultra loud, excellent film brought to you by the people that brought to you Back to the Future: Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg among others! So, where do the filmmakers get the title? Well, Roger Rabbit (Charles Fleischer) was framed for killing the famous Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye). But since he was \"framed\", who really did the killing? Well there's one person so sinister, so dark, and so evil, it's not even funny. Who, WHO could possibly be that person? Well, you'll find out the answers even though it's pretty obvious. Who's the most evil character that tries to kill the valiant Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins)? Who's the evil immoral jerk that killed Eddie's brother (\"D-dropped a piano on his head!\")? Who tried to kill Eddie himself by trying to kill him with a razor sharp yellow cartoon wheel that spins round and round to slice him in half? Who's the \"inhuman\" toon that has bulging eyes? All those answers are revealed in the movie for you. Because the movie is so great but too short, it has bunches and bunches of things you need to follow that are actually surprisingly \"fun\" to follow! The movie opens with a scene from a cartoon starring Roger Rabbit himself. Roger has to save the baby that's stuck on the counter who could careless about Roger. He just wants to get to the jar of cookies at the top of the refrigerator and then Roger gets injured a lot in that. So at the end of the cartoon, Roger gets smashed in the head carelessly, and sees tweedy birds around his head instead of stars that he was supposed to see. So the director starts yelling at him. Surprisingly the innocent baby in the cartoon even started yelling at him in an annoying raspy middle-aged fat man's voice. So Roger starts hitting his head trying to prove to the director that he can see stars instead of chirping tweedy birds around his head. Then it focuses in on Eddie who then says in a typical-annoyed-basically-stating-that-all-toons-are-that-way voice, \"Toons\". Anywaaazz, how would Roger try to keep secret and hide by neither keeping secret nor hiding? By hiding in a bar owned by Valiant's \"friend\" Dolores (Joanna Cassidy). He would have to make sure not to cause too much attraction unless he wants to be submerged face down into Judge Doom's (Christopher Lloyd's) THE DIP! So Valiant keeps him with Dolores in a bar that shakes every time a trolley goes by causing the lights to shake and almost hit someone in the head. Yet Roger is a TOON and can't keep secret at all. He \"has to make people laugh!\" So he sings to them and uses a record as background music. When the record gets stuck in one spot and does the same note over and over and over again, Roger will also do the same thing over and over and over again using plates to crash on his head (do-do, CRASH, do-do, CRASH, do-do, CRASH, do-do, CRASH)! So Eddie picks him up from the bar knocking over the remaining plates and lets them shatter and throws him in to a dark room to shut him up. That's where he needs to hide but not for long\u0085\u0085\u0085 In the movie there's the will of Marvin Acme involved in the external conflict and the body and soul of R.K. Maroon (Alan Tilvern), owner of Maroon Cartoons. But then Cloverleaf butts in and la-di-da and if you haven't seen the film, I suggest you do since it's a classic and will remain one. Toon Town, Maroon Cartoons, Acme Cartoons, the whole story of Judge Doom and the freeway needing to be built, THE DIP, the characters themselves and the names of them are rather clever, the whole deal/package! What a wonderful, excellent film! Movie directed by Robert Zemeckis.",

            "content": "Before the CGI phenomenon and Dreamworks's digital animation kicked off in the late 90s- early 00s, animated films were still hand drawn and well animated. Bob Zemeckis- who had hit the big time with the first Back to the Future film, turned his attention to making a movie by combining both live action and quality animation. The collaboration of all the Disney, Warner Bros and Tex Avery cartoon characters is just amazing to see- although it would've been just as great had Hanna Barbera and its creations, Yogi Bear and Boo Boo, Fred Flintstone, Top Cat, Huckleberry Hound, Scooby Doo to name made an appearance or two as well.'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' is one of the finest animated movies of all- time and so enjoyable to sit through as well. British actor Bob Hoskins plays an American detective, Eddie Valiant- a guy who hates toons well in fact anything to do with them, whose partner in crime dies after being killed by one of the toons in Toon Land. Roger meanwhile is being framed for a crime he didn't commit after a businessman, who has a sexual encounter with Jessica Rabbit, is found murdered and he finds himself a prime suspect to the case. So Roger goes on the run from the mob and seeks refuge in Eddie's hideout. It is up to Eddie to help clear Roger's name and for Roger to further convince Eddie that he wasn't responsible for the victim's death. Christopher Lloyd who played Doc Brown in BTTF again makes his mark on another Zemeckis effort; this time as an evil villain trying to thwart Eddie and Roger's plans.These days with many computer generated animated films, whilst they look impressive on screen, the makers often sacrificed the quality of the narrative and story lines in favour of fancy graphics. With 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?', what we have is a terrific film, where both the juxtaposing of live action sequences and animation are of a high standard. The animation looks fluid and smooth and to this day, it hasn't diminished the film one bit. The special effects are brilliant and the performances- both vocally from the voice actors and live actors, are one of a kind. The film is well written and the concept is well implemented and devised. Kathleen Turner does exceptionally well as the voice of Jessica, capturing her sexual presence and oozing a vixen-like persona. Charles Fleischer does a sterling job as the often maniacal Roger; he was able to switch from being insane and plain crazy to unfortunate and sad, often this would occur in one particular scene.Not even Space Jam or the okay-ish Looney Toons: Back in Action could rival this 80's effort. But the success of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' goes to show that one doesn't always have to rely on CGI to produce a really great animated feature film with live action sequences thrown in. Likewise, the characters are well drawn and colourful without the need of being pixel lated. Although Space Jam and Looney Toons both looked impressive, the narrative in those movies weren't as strong, effective, nor as appealing as 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?'.Entertaining, light-hearted and well executed, this is a must for all those who love watching classic cartoons and their favourite characters come together for the first time on the big screen.Rating: 9 and a half out of 10",

Robert Zemeckis proved to be a master filmmaker with this complex and masterfully edited cinematic gem about a 1930's down and out Hollywood detective (the brilliant Bob Hoskins) who is hired to prove a cartoon rabbit named Roger is innocent of a murder he did not commit. With the aid of crack technical people (the film won four Oscars for its technical mastery), Zemeckis has crafted a completely believable melding of real people and animated characters that is hard to resist. I love when Hoskins is walking through a movie studio and you see all these famous animated characters from the past walking around (he even bumps into one of the hippos from FANATASIA). There's a scene in a nightclub where all the waiters look like the penguins from MARY POPPINS and Betty Boop is the cigarette girl. Charles Fleischer provides the voice of the title character and his wife Jessica, who is human but animated (\"Im not bad...I'm just drawn that way.\")has the speaking voice of Kathleen Turner and the singing voice of Amy Irving. But other than the technical wizardry that is apparent in every frame of this film, the thing that makes it all click is the amazing performance by Hoskins, who plays the character totally straight as if her were in a real detective story from the 30's. It is his straight acting approach to these comical situations (aided by Zemeckis I'm sure) that makes this whole bizarre roller coaster ride come together.

I did, however, run and hide from certain scenes later in the movie that I do not want to spoil for those lucky souls who still have yet to see this.

It only takes a viewing of the DVD's special features to see that making this film was a painstaking process.

Every film noir story needs an hard-boiled detective and this one is no exception with Eddie Valiant, perfectly played by Bob Hoskins.Valiant doesn't like the \"Toons\" which live in Toontown, an isolated borough somewhere in L.A., but he accepts an offer which gives him the mandate to spy on nightclub owner Marvin Acme and Roger's wife, the hypnotizing femme fatale Jessica Rabbit.What Eddie doesn't suspect is that he just got embarked into a palpitating adventure, filled with murder, lies and big-money business. Then you add the terrifying Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) and a conspiracy inspired from a real-life urban legend.\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is at the same time an homage and a parody of classic noirs from the 40s and the 50s and contains classic elements and others intended to provoke laughs and frenzy for the viewers who could only leave the theater with an open smile on their faces.Directing a film noir is already complicated enough, so imagine if you have to add animated characters inside. Fortunately, Robert Zemeckis clearly shows that he's the man for such a feature. Zemeckis shows that he has an overflowing imagination and he visibly has fun in making this movie.What more, Zemeckis et Williams use a technique and a philosophy both borrowed to Walt Disney himself : what's difficult isn't avoidable and even desirable. Both directors never try to simplify their task and the actors react with an immaculate professionalism, especially those who directly interact with Toons.The very complicated plot, the nihilistic environment and the lighting methods are worth the greatest noirs, but some characteristics (such as Valiant's shadow saying \"Bless you\" after the detective sneezes) attenuate this sinister landscape and make the film more attracting to people of all ages.But the main problem with the movie is precisely about the targeted audience. There is no doubt that \"Roger Rabbit\" is an adult film. But I have no doubt that some mature movie buffs will believe that it's a kiddie flick, just because of the Toons' presence. And this is definitely not a children's movie. The story is way too complicated, there's enough sex and violence to unleash an outcry and Judge Doom can become so disturbing that he could worry youngsters.However, I encourage adults to see this movie because they would bitterly regret it if they miss their chance. Adding to the already-mentioned elements are the brilliantly orchestrated action sequences by Zemeckis and his crew. The wild chase with Benny the Cab is stirring and the final battle in the warehouse gave me fun like I've rarely had before.Anyway, the entire movie gave me fun like I've rarely had before. It would take an entire dictionary in order to find all the appropriate terms to describe \"Roger Rabbit\". But words aren't necessary. You just need to watch it to experience a goofy orgasm which is the apotheosis of the live-action/animation mix.",

An incredible achievement in special effects and film editing, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, even 25 years after its original release in 1988, has stood the test of time and become a film near and dear to my heart. I grew up with this movie, and the cartoons peppered within, and seeing this movie again just makes me yearn for the good old days of fantastically violent cartoon comedy. It's filled with lighthearted laughs but isn't afraid to be darkly comical, and Zemeckis walks this tight rope act perfectly. It features an original and surprisingly great film noir story, phenomenal animation and strong performances to boot. There isn't a moment of live/animated action that looks fake; it all feels tangible and real, which is the real achievement (and amazing that 25 years later it still looks fantastic). It's also incredibly sad that we will never, ever get another movie quite like Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Cartoons have changed, and so has Hollywood. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the finest examples of \"movie magic\" if I ever saw it, and I will defend that to the day I die. I may be wearing my nostalgia on my sleeve a little, but I can truly say that this movie has aged phenomenally well and is truly a masterful film.",

            "content": "A trendsetter when originally released, Who Framed Roger Rabbit? contains a mixture of live action/animation which holds a legacy of starting the renaissance of feature length animations. For those of a certain age who may associate Who Framed Roger Rabbit? with their childhoods it must have been one of wonder and originality, but that's only speculation on my part. Not being born until the early 90s I was widely exposed the surge of Pixar and Disney animations through out my childhood. This is one way of explaining why my spectatorship of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? was at times indifferent.A reason regarding my indifference is reflected in the storyline. Detective Eddie Valiant is hired by Cartoon Studio owner R.K. Maroon on a routine investigation on behalf of Roger Rabbit, yet true to form the case is not so cut and dried as Valiant is forced into a scenario of murder and corruption. It's a plot which is been recycled dozens of times before and since creating no suspense to the Noir/Crime influenced narrative.Even the characterisations rely on stale stereotypes with Valiant being the alcohol \u2013 addicted and emotionally conflicted private eye and in a lesser role, his suffering on/off girlfriend Dolores who desperately longs for reclaiming Valiant's affection. Considering the personalities of the characters and the storyline can be compared to a range of films, it becomes difficult to appreciate its worth specifically in terms of the overall story. Part of this also relies on the acting, which only Christopher Lloyd gave a standout performance as Judge Doom with deadly determination and evil demeanour conveying himself as a horrific antagonist.Who Framed Roger Rabbit? seemed overly relevant on its animated characters to steer towards a fresh direction when no significance was being applied to the live action. Though it is very harsh to criticise its crippling reliance on animation since it was intended to be a large part in the film's character, it did give Who Framed Roger Rabbit? an enhanced quality, which is an advantage. In a car chase sequence where Valiant and Roger Rabbit use an animated talking car to escape, zig zagging through traffic and pulling off impressive stunts, most notably extending in height to finally evade the villainous Toon police. Having the animation did give an extra dynamic to the action and helped create the surreal atmosphere where humans and cartoons co \u2013 existed. Also in brief the inclusion of Jennifer Rabbit as a sultry woman whose animated presence I saw as a cherished tribute to the notable females of film noir.On the flip side of what was stated earlier regarding the typical plot devices and stereotypes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, it was clever in attracting an older audience in building up certain expectations only to be humorously surprised. The pinnacle of this subversive humour was watching Valiant from a distance taking pictures of his suspects as part of an investigation with distant mutters of \"pattycake\" and enthusiastic shouts of enjoyment hinting at a sexual encounter, only for older spectators to have this idea turned on its head when it's revealed the children's game of pattycake was being played. The magnitude of sexual innuendo within Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is both great humour and shockingly risqu\u00e9 for children's film by today's standards.In spite of its lacking originality in plot and characters, the ambitious scale of animation and its various uses to distorting perceived reality to create a surreal universe amongst an unoriginal narrative can still be appreciated to an extent.",

Not only that, but it was filmed primarily at Pinewood studios, just as Batman was being made.It is normally extremely difficult to render live action with cartoon animation, especially for the actors. From what I've heard, Charles Flescher actually did rehearse with Bob Hoskins in a big rabbit costume.Next to the cartoons, Christopher Lloyd as Judge Doom is another big part of the movie. As a theater trained actor, he is extremely good at what he does and gives that creepy vibe. Not only that, but he had to work with the animation for his big scene near the end of the movie.Great piece of work. It's something that I could watch again and again and again.

Ever since I first watched it, I fell in love with the film, and since then, it has continued to entertain me and has aged well like fine wine.This movie takes place in Hollywood in 1947, and cartoon characters (known as \"Toons\") coexist with humans. A toon known as Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) finds out that his wife Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Kathleen Turner) was playing patty cake with Marvin Acme (Stubby Kaye), and this puts Roger in a heartbreaking state. The next day, Marvin Acme is dead and Roger has gotten framed for his murder. A detective named Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), hates toons because a toon killed his brother, but he reluctantly helps Roger clear his name before the evil Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) finds Roger and puts him in a toon-killing acid known as the Dip.This movie is simply classic. It was very revolutionary for its time as it was a great way to have animation in the real world, and was essentially an epic crossover. You get moments such as Donald and Daffy Duck having a piano battle, and Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny interacting with each other in the sky. Stuff like this wouldn't happen again in a long time, making this film absolutely awesome. The acting from everyone was great, Bob Hoskins was a great hero, and Christopher Llyod was an amazing villain to where I'd say this is my favorite role of his (yes, better than Doc Brown in my opinion). The story had a great mystery vibe to it and stayed very consistent. The comedy also worked great as it was your typical slapstick kind of comedy. This film honestly had a mixture of different genres, but for the most part, this was a fantasy film and I loved it so much that it is the greatest fantasy film I've ever seen.With a terrific mystery story, stunning animation, great acting, nice comedy, and being an overall astounding fantasy film, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is easily one of the greatest films of all time.",

            "content": "In what may be defined as one of the most innovative and creative approaches to film, Robert Zemeckis holds no boundaries and brings us an amazing tale that holds a place in Hollywood's Finest. The story itself shows us a life in that we all dreamed about as children: a place where cartoons and humans live side by side. That's when the dream world becomes a nightmare and the cartoons find themselves on thin ice. One of the most respectable cartoon characters from ToonTown, Roger Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) is wanted for the murder of Marvin Acme (played in a short but comical role by Stubby Kaye), the very owner of ToonTown and Acme cartoon products; yes, you can now own dynamite, portable holes, and super Toon glue in your very own home. Without justice for toons, Roger finds himself at the end of the drawing table and only one step away from the wrath of Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd), who's only dream is to destroy ToonTown and everything in it. Out of desperation, Roger seeks help from human detective Eddie Valiant (played by Bob Hoskins in a landmark role). There's just two small problems: Valiant was hired only a few days ago to spy on Roger's wife Jessica, and things didn't look very good once it was discovered that she was playing 'pattycake' with Marvin Acme himself; also, Valliant refuses to work for toons, as his brother/partner was killed by a toon not too long ago (dropped a piano on his head). However, Valiant cannot turn Roger away (especially because now Roger's handcuffed himself to Valiant's arm), and agrees to take the case. Along the way, both Roger and Valiant discover a web of conspiracy linking Acme, Jessica, R.K. Maroon (head of Roger's cartoon studio), and the missing will of Marvin Acme that will ultimately decide who gets to run ToonTown. and whether or not it will end up just like its former owner.Who Framed Roger Rabbit brings to life the essence of murder mystery that became so popular in the 1940s, bringing out conspiracy, sex, lies, and murder in a dark tale that we watch with open eyes and find ourselves laughing the next minute. Unlike many other dark comedies, Zemeckis brings out the humor in decent proportion and reminding us that laughter can still be appreciated, even in a serious mystery. The movie also brings out a bright list of cartoon characters recognized by audiences of young and old, ranging from Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Woody Woodpecker, and introducing hilarious new characters such as Baby Herman, Roger's cigar-smoking partner in the cartoon business; Benny the Cab, a tough-talking taxi; Jessica Rabbit, showing us once and for all that just because you're a cartoon doesn't mean that you can't have serious sex appeal; and the Weasels, Judge Doom's gang of cartoon gangsters who do all of their boss's dirty work.Even with the superb list of characters, Who Framed Roger Rabbit showcases amazing special effects never before witnessed in film. While watching scenes where Roger and Valiant are side by side in the human world, the average viewer can almost believe that there really is a talking rabbit standing next to Hoskins (in the imagination, anyway). The interaction between the real actors and the cartoons is simply eye-popping and leads the way for an entire new branch of filming and animation. All in all, Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a legend of its own time and a simple reminder that children are not the only ones who can appreciate good animation.",

The whole idea of Toontown was brilliant-like a cinematic mythology-and the story worked well.  I dont think of it as a comedy however---the jokes were rather few and far between. I found it to be more of a dark fantasy--as exhibited by the disturbing scene where the peaceful toon shoe gets \"dipped.\" I realize that last line must sound ludicrous to those who havent seen it--if you havent, you should!  By today's fx standards the film's special effects seem flat(in most scenes)--but unlike say, Jurassic Park, it has a decent story to fall back on.Joe Dante is said to have been among the candidates to direct it. Although Zemeckis did a fine job, i think Dante would have brought more humour to it(and Terry Gilliam, more depth).A couple of points of interest: one--the novel has a VASTLY different storyline and conclusion. Second--although Felix the cat could not be enlisted for the movie(he wanted too much money), if you look closely above the entrance to the Toontown tunnel--you can see a face marking it that looks  very familiar.Overall i think WFRR created a cartoon mythology that was quite inspired--if only some more non-Disney and Warners toon stars could have been included!",

            "content": "This movie introduced and was focused on a new animated character Roger Rabbit. However, the selling point of this movie was the inclusion of tons of characters from previously competing cartoon franchises. The movie was much more a display of the Disney Company flexing its muscles in regards to it's business-level victory over its competition and to show its current financial dominance over the various animation companies from animation's Golden Age. So we have Daffy Duck in piano playing competition on the same screen with Donald Duck! What makes this extremely annoying is taking characters such as Daffy with such an established rich history of character development. Here in Roger Rabbit, Daffy is just a \"daffy duck\" playing a piano. My expectations were to see DAFFY DUCK playing a piano along with all that that implies. WFRR's daffy duck was similar to the early black and white Daffy Duck during the Leon Schlesinger time of Looney Tunes. I certainly enjoy the Looney Tunes of Schlesinger's era but it certainly does not represent the rich character that Daffy developed into. And even then Daffy still had more personality then just being 'daffy' as presented here. We also have my all-time favorite cartoon character Droopy being poorly drawn not at all faithful to Tex Avery's character just appearing for a second in a stupid cameo to give a line that was presented in a way also unfaithful to Droopy's established personality. We have a slew of these cameos from Betty Boop, Woody Woodpecker, Mighty Mouse, etc. None of which showed any respect to these characters but were obviously Disney showing its financial might in having the rights to use these characters. Not that WFRR didn't do the same with Disney characters. Not being a big fan of Disney animation, I didn't mind as much. I guess I can consider the possibility that WFRR did not mean to purposefully sell the borrowed characters short. It shows a difference in the focus of the different cartoon franchises. Disney animation focuses much more on story and technical artistry of the features. In contrast to Disney was Warner Brothers and MGM. While the artistry was superior to Disney it was in a less intricate and focused on style instead of technically grand design of Disney. However, the most dividing difference in Disney and WB/MGM animation was Disney showed little interest in establishing characters. WB/MGM were almost entirely focused on making characters. In other words, Disney character's personalities were designed to serve the story. WB/MGM's stories were designed to serve the characters. That is where WFRR offends, we have all these great characters just appearing randomly at best but usually contrary to character. This movie really should have had only the Roger Rabbit story in it. It really wasn't that bad. In fact, it was good. The animation was fine. The story was funny and enhanced by the gags (only the ones by WFRR original characters). As for Roger Rabbit himself, he's made for this movie which is fine. But he's not a character that is interesting in himself outside of his place in this movie. Nothing wrong with that. It would have been an enjoyable movie if left at that. The poor treatment of classic characters really caused me to dislike this film.",

It takes the live action/ animation combination to a new level, and does so with genuine hard work, rather than clever trickery.In the first place, the animation was done by cartoonists who drew each frame by hand, just like in the old days.  Furthermore, they worked without the benefit of the artificial restraints that are customarily placed on live-action footage to make the combination easier (for example, no camera movement of any kind in any shot that's going to include animated figures).And there was hard work on the part of the actors too, all of whom were trained in mime, so that they could create a convincing illusion of picking up and throwing around cartoon object and animals that had some weight to them.  The actors also took great pains with such matters as maintaining convincing eye contact with the animated characters, and being sure never to forget they were in the scene.Furthermore, the movie had a fully-developed plot and three-dimensional characters. (Well, you know what I mean.)  It would have been very easy to get caught up in technique and forget all the other elements that make a movie complete.Alas, however, speaking from a purely subjective viewpoint, I didn't like this movie.  Why?  Because cartoons were a happy part of my childhood, and I hated to see these cartoon characters stripped of their innocence.Let me qualify this, however, by saying that it wouldn't have bothered me in a movie that was supposed to be disturbing. For example, I found the twisted cartoon images in the `It's a Good Life' sequence from THE TWILIGHT ZONE MOVIE quite effective.  But when this corruption is used as a vehicle for comedy, it leaves me feeling like somebody dumped mud all over something I hold dear.",

Since I was young, I never really got the name of the rabbit until I saw this masterpiece of a film and was blown all the way to the moon. Who Framed Roger Rabbit is not only a comical action packed suspense thriller, but a film which brings all our childhood fantasies to reality. Who didn't want to see Mickey Mouse interact with Bugs Bunny? Who didn't want to see Donald Duck throw Daffy Duck into a piano? Who didn't want to see Mary Poppins' penguins serving drinks in a nightclub? It's all stuff we imagined as youngsters, and this film brought it all together in a well paced, well put together, exciting, innovative, and most of all entertaining epic. It's undeniably one of my all time favorite animated films and one of my all time favorite films in general.I think what I love most about this movie is the way the human characters interact with the cartoon characters. The way Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) picks up Roger and tosses him in the sink, pretending to do his laundry, it's hilarious and impressive at the same time, and I still question how they were able to pull off such an effect. The way Jessica Rabbit dances around Marvin Acme, tugging on his cheeks and taking the hat off his head, it makes you think the cartoon characters are actually there and not inked animated creations superimposed over the film. I also like the scenes where the cartoons interact with human appliances. The scene where Roger is drinking, he's drinking from a real glass and he picks it up just like a flesh and blood human would. The scene where Roger is smashing plates over his head, he's smashing real plates and not animated cartoon ones. The scene where the Toon Patrol tracks down Eddie, they are wielding real guns and not cartoon ones. What's ironic is that the human Eddie would wield a cartoon gun later on in the film. This film has the perfect blend of slapstick, humor, drama, terror and straight forward fun, which makes sense for a film involving cartoon entities. I love some of the jokes seen throughout the motion picture and the puns spewed from the mouths of some of the characters really add a bit of comic relief, even in the film's most horrifying of scenes. I really love Charles Fleischer's voice work as Roger Rabbit, but would you believe Paul \"Pee-Wee Herman\" Reubens originally auditioned for the voice. Although Reubens would have done a great job, I really dig Fleischer's voicing of the character, especially his PWWWWLLLEEEAASSSEEE! You gotta love that, for it's the character's most distinctive trademark and makes him stick out among other rabbit characters in the world of the Toons. Bob Hoskins is also phenomenal as Eddie Valiant and to this day, it's considered one of his best roles, although I'll always remember him for playing Mario Mario.But the actor who steals the show in my eyes is Christopher Lloyd as the slinky yet intimidating Judge Doom. Straight out of Back to the Future, Lloyd delivers a menacing performance that has you laughing and screaming in fright all at once. You really feel frightened by this dude, and although he is defeated in the end, he sticks out in your mind and has his cartoonish red eyes watching you in your dreams. He's just that chilling. Although the human/cartoon interaction and Lloyd are some of my favorite aspects of the film, my favorite moment of the film is the scene at the very end where the wall to Toon Town is broken and all our favorites come running out to get the spotlight. Literally, ALL our favorites are there. Mickey, Bugs, Betty Boop, Woody Woodpecker, Donald, Daffy, Goofy, Yosemite Sam, Pinocchio, Droopy Dog, even Peter from Disney's adaptation of Peter and the Wolf somehow squeezes in a cameo. My only gripe is that my all time favorite cat and mouse duo Tom and Jerry don't make an appearance, but that's just a miner nitpick.Overall, this is a perfect movie. This film clearly displays what films are made of or can be made of if a lot of hard work and ingenuity are put into them. This film clearly displays what fantasies and images of imagination are all about, and takes all the things we love about the Toons and blends them all together into one solid concoction. It also combines genres. One time it can be an action thriller, the other time it can be a romantic comedy, the other time it can be a horror film with Judge Doom drowning a Toon shoe in the horrid \"Dip\". It puts together a lot of stuff we love about the movies and when you set your eyes upon this film, no matter how many times you set your eyes upon it, your inner child is released and in no time, you feel like your in another dimension filled with flying elephants and reluctant dragons. AND DON'T FORGET THE FLOWERS AND TREES. This is a solid picture that I've seen so many times, and I still can't believe how magnificent it is.",

            "content": "\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is a truly unique film. It is part film noir, part animation, part comedy, and part drama. That is something that Hollywood doesn't make each day.The movie takes place in Los Angeles in 1947. Roger Rabbit, a Toon, as all the cartoon characters are called, is filming a cartoon and has trouble with a scene. Detective Eddie Valiant watches from behind the scenes and afterward goes to see studio head R.K. Maroon, who informs Valiant that Roger cannot concentrate because his wife Jessica Rabbit, another Toon, has reportedly been seen with a man recently. Maroon wants Valiant to find out who the man is. This does not sit well with Valiant because a Toon murdered his brother some years earlier. However, he ultimately agrees to take the case.It does not take long for Valiant to find out who the man is: Marvin Acme, the owner of Toontown and the Gag Factory. Valiant reports his findings to Maroon and Roger, and Roger goes crazy and takes off.The next morning, Valiant gets word that Acme has been killed. Once he arrives at the Acme Factory, Valiant meets Judge Doom, who has fingered Roger as the guilty party in Acme's murder. His goal is to find Roger and bring him to justice, which includes putting Roger into a barrel of \"dip,\" which is the one way a Toon can be destroyed. Doom and his Toon Patrol, a quintet of weasels, are on the lookout for Roger.After leaving the Acme Factory, Valiant returns to his office, and Roger is there waiting for him. He tells Valiant he did not kill Acme, and pleads with Valiant to help him clear his name. Valiant at first wants no part of this, but eventually he decides to help Roger.While this is going on, Acme's will is missing, and Valiant is also keeping an eye out for that. The finding of the will is important because it involves Toontown's future.There is not one bad thing about this movie. The casting is terrific, with Bob Hoskins giving an excellent performance as Valiant, and Cristopher Lloyd is a convincing Judge Doom, who is a very eerie individual. The animation is first rate, and fans of the animation genre will love that the major cartoon characters from Disney, Warner Bros., and other studios, are in this film. What is truly amazing is how the Toons and the humans actually interact. It really looks as if the Toons are real. There are also very funny and clever sight gags, many of them a tribute to the cartoon shorts of yesteryear. The script also pays tribute to the history of animation at times, and has some funny lines as well. Not only that, it is also successful in making the characters interesting and memorable, and that applies to the humans and the Toons. The sets deserve mentioning also. It looks completely like Los Angeles in 1947.\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is a movie that everyone can enjoy. The kids will obviously love the cartoons, as will admirers of animation. Adults can find the story interesting with it being part mystery. Of course, the film works as a comedy, too, and everyone will certainly laugh at some point. This is a great movie. Don't miss it.",

            "content": "\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is definitely a classic. It was the first movie to be a complete mix of live-action and animation, and it did it perfectly. Anyway, the story of the movie is: Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) takes pictures of Roger Rabbit's wife Jessica playing patty-cake with another man. Roger is very sad to find this out, and the very next day, Marvin Acme, the man Jessica played patty-cake with, is murdered, and the cartoon rabbit is framed for the crime. Everyone is after Roger, including the evil, 'toon-hating Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd).This movie was not only one of the most original movies at the time, it was also one of the best. It perfectly blends live-action with animation, the plot is very good and original, the voice acting and the live acting is great, and the movie is very funny. When I was little I loved this movie, and now that I'm older, I probably love it even more than I did. Partly because I now understand all of the adult humor in the movie, and because I can now truly appreciate how this movie was so revolutionary, and original for 1988.Another great thing about this movie is how many different cartoon characters from different studios are all seen on the same screen. Like on the scene where Daffy Duck and Donald Duck are seeing dueling pianos, or when Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny are actually seen together talking when Eddie is falling, or on the ending when we see many different cartoon characters together including Bambi, Pinocchio, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Woody Woodpecker, Bugs Bunny, Donald Duck, Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, and many others.Well, I'd say \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is one of the top 5 greatest animated movies ever, and I'd say it is the best movie of the '80s, and it's easily the best live-action / animation hybrid of all time. I love everything about this movie. It truly is a masterpiece. It's funny, original, clever, and just plain awesome. Not only is it great to see so many classic cartoon characters in one movie, but even this movie's own characters like Roger, Jessica, and Baby Herman are great. I love this movie.Rating: 10/10 \"Amazing\"",

            "content": "It's been 20 years since Who Framed Roger Rabbit opened back in 1988. 20 years later the film is not just the granddaddy of modern animation, but it is also in my opinion, the essential family film of all family films in the current era. Who Framed Roger Rabbit truly set the standard for the personality that all other family films that followed after it, would have. The personality of Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a balance of the outrageous humor you see in comedies of the current era, and classic physical slapstick comedy performed by the classic comedians of the Golden Age of Hollywood.Roger Rabbit really kept that balance, it was not a film that only adults should see, and it was not a film just for parents with kids who want to take their children to a movie they want to see. Roger Rabbit was truly a movie for everyone in the family which includes parents with kids, and adults who do not have a family of their own but are interested in seeing this family movie with adult themes they can identify with or understand. That is how family movies today should still be like, not too child-oriented and not very adult-oriented, they should be a combination of a movie for the family and a movie for adults.Family movies should be presented in the middle between both types of film and they must never be just for kids or little kids. They have got to be for everyone to enjoy, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit set the bar for how modern family films should be marketed and who they should appeal to. Roger Rabbit truly defines what it means to be a classic family film.",

            "content": "\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\"A review by Craig Barron.In \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\", a 1988 film by Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Castaway, the Back to the Future trilogy) Zemeckis masterfully combines animation and live action in one ofthe most technically challenging and innovative films ever made. It the not the first film to mixlive action and animation together but it is hands down the the one that does it best. It succeeds,however because the filmmakers don't show off their technical expertise we also get a very witty and sharp satire that affectionately parodies the film noir genre as well as the detective dramas of the 1940s.Bob Hoskins as the detective, Eddie Valiant, gives a flawless performance one of his best.And Christopher LLoyd creates one of the most memorable screen villains of all time as the menacing Judge Doom. The big reveal about his true identity (which I won't spoil here) isdelightful and given the identity of the actor playing the role a natural one as well.My main complaint about the film, ironically enough is the actor who provides the voice of Roger comedian Charles Fleischer. I found the voice the be somewhat annoying and grating.This however is a minor quibble as this is one Zemeckis's best films and one of Disney's best Zemeckis has always been an innovator in the use of special effects in his films and this one is different. A superb family entertainment for both adults and kids alike it it highly recommended.",

            "content": "\"Smile, Darn Ya, Smile,\" sings every cartoon creature in Toon Town, in the over-the-top second act production number as Eddie drives into town. It is a song from a 1931 Friz Freleng cartoon. The whole countryside is singing, including the trees, the sun, the flowers and the birds. It is so ridiculously happy, so infectious and outrageous, you can see how a sourpuss like Eddie would be annoyed. But it makes me incredibly happy each time I see it. It's exactly what cartoons represent in this movie -- pure joy.It is a wonder that such unbounded silliness can suddenly bring tears to your eyes. I speak of the scene when Eddie Valiant is flipping through some newly developed photos, to find pictures of his dead brother and partner, taken before he died.The movie does not play this scene for cheap sobs, but tenderly and humanly. Eddie shows little emotion on his face, and the music is sweet and simple. Suddenly we know what everyone was talking about when they said, \"A toon killed his brother.\" The photos show he was more than a brother. The slow pan across his brother's desk show his whole life, just as Hitchcock did for Jimmy Stewart's character in the first scene of Rear Window. The story? Here was a business partner who had shared Eddie's successes (successes now lost in dust and drink), and a best friend who could hang out at the beach with Eddie and his girlfriend, sing, drink and have some laughs. He was someone Eddie probably didn't know how much he loved until he lost him. Now he was alone, his business gone, and his life over. He couldn't return to his old work -- Toons -- because that was the world of joy he had lost. He thought that joy had betrayed him.The extravagance in details, especially the small ones, are what sells this movie. The sets and costumes are sumptuous. And the humor is in every line and gag. It's pretty funny to see Eddie snag a free ride on the back of a trolley car with a bunch of school boys. It's more funny when Eddie hops off and thanks the boys for the cigarettes.The melding of the real world and the cartoon world is brilliant. Cartoons have a natural effect on their surroundings. Cartoon logic makes complete sense in this picture; when Judge Doom tries to trick Roger out of hiding with his \"shave and a haircut\" routine, it's hilarious because it's true, and it's suspenseful because it's true. It's perfect.It is an homage to every cartoon ever made. The saxophone player and the dancing brooms giving a bow to Fantasia... And a swell, multi-level gag that most people miss: When Eddie takes pictures of Jessica \"playing patty-cake\" with Marvin, the two *really are* just playing patty-cake. What a gag. But when Roger flips through the photos, they move so quickly that the actions in the still photos become animated. What you are looking at, in fact, is the very first kind of cartoon -- the animated flip-books that once sold for a few pennies, long before the first movie was ever made. It hearkens back to the earliest days of cinema and animation. It's simply sublime.This movie does have its flaws; it drags during the warehouse scenes, for some reason. But watch for the many sub-references to the world of cartoons, and the rich sets, the beautiful color, the flawless editing, the physical humor. The movie revels in the rich history of cartoons, bringing together characters never before seen on the same screen. Such a movie will never be made again. It is old-time cartoons' last bow. It's a marvel.",

            "content": "POSSIBLE SPOILERS. If I watch future Sylvester & Tweety cartoons, I'll be very tempted to root for Sylvester after the way little Tweety disregarded poor Eddie Valient's life for the sake of a \"Dis wido piddy went to market\" game! LOL. Doing it to Sylvester the cat would be one thing. At least he was trying to harm him, so it would be easier to justify the actions. Eddie was just trying to save himself after walking through the wrong door. I think a good poetic justice on Tweety would be the \"Adult Swim\" treatment. Tweety is put so at the mercy of Sylvester that only Eddie Valient save his butt.Though I am largely being tongue & cheek & I thought the whole feature was funnier than all get-out, I think there is still some food for thought. Namely that Tweety Bird was a character we grew up believing we should be sympathetic towards when he's being stalked by Sly. One of the things that made the violence & misfortunes in the W/B cartoons easy to laugh at is that they were usually just desserts visited upon the trouble makers. Unlike some of the Walter Lance(Woody Woodpecker ect.)features, which I think I remember as being a little more malicious.All the Sigmund Froid aside, I think I can pretty well mirror what the reviewers before me said. This brought mixed animation & comedy to a new level. Like Back to the Future before it-to use an old cliche- it was a laugh a minute.In a very real way, it was a coming full circle of the classic cartoons. It wasn't just for kids, it was for adults who remembering these toons from childhood. It capitalised on many of the gags in a way that's easily funny to adults. OBTW, my understanding of many of the W/B cartoons were intended to be as adult-funny as permissible for a child-friendly cartoon for the standard of the time.",

No, not movie -- film. This is a film. There were no shortcuts taken; thank heavens this was made in 1988 and Roger had to be animated by hand, because I imagine how artificial a 3D Roger Rabbit would look, move, and possibly even act.This is not to say 3D can't be done right (see Coco), but an eccentric character like Roger works better when he is given the freedom to move in a way computers do not yet allow. Computer animation, even now in 2022, is restrictive.Bob Hoskins essentially acts alone half the time, but it's hard to tell. I have always had a fondness for character actors over \"stars\" who show up in a movie looking, sounding, and moving like themselves 90% of the time. Hoskins disappears into Eddie Valient. Even \"method acting\" darlings like Christian Bale lack the range of a Bob Hoskins. Had Mr. Hoskins delivered a subpar performance, this film would've failed.The story is filled with \"Chekov's guns\"; the plot seamlessly introduces elements that play a larger role in the final act. We, the audience, understand so much about toontown in a natural way. The expositional dialogue is antithetical to a movie like Inception.But what is most memorable are scenes where Looney Tunes and Disney characters share the screen. I can't imagine the reaction people must've had seeing this movie in theaters 1988.A word of warning to parents: don't let the PG rating fool you. This is a 1980's PG, so think of the film as a soft PG-13.82.63/100.",

The setting is centered in an animated world in which Roger Rabbit exaggerates the whole cartoon treatment to a high degree in my opinion and his stunts impress us and heighten the effect very well. As when he is taking a beating from his partner and counterpart Baby Herman. His girlfriend Jessica Rabbit reflects on us as a truly sexy lover had she only been real. One gets the idea that this movie is trying to reach a much broader audience by combining the two kinds of genres and this is proven by its large popularity. But the film doesn't get carried away with the hype, as there is not a lot of Roger Rabbit and his friends merchandise out there to be found.

Marron was murdered and someone wanted to frame Roger Rabbit and also Eddie Valiant IMO is Roger's confidante. The baby, who actually smokes and has quite an attitude helps Eddie in nabbing the person responsible for murdering R.K. Marroon. Now Roger's wife Jessica Rabbit stops by Toontown and sees what type of conspiracy.

            "content": "\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is such a fun movie that It could be viewed several times and never get boring. The story is GREAT and obviously, so are the special effects. One of the great joys in this movie is seeing a lot of our favorite cartoon characters together for the first time. Like when Daffy Duck and Donald Duck have a warm up act together on stage, or when Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse go skydiving together.One of the most effective things in this movie is it's vilain. Judge Doom is one of the creepiest bad guys I've ever seen. I love it at the end when you learn what his evil plan actually is; All through the movie you think that Doom is an evil mastermind, and at the end, it turns out that his evil plan is completely idiotic. Doom is played wonderfully by Chris Lloyd, who is one of the greatest actors ever.The plot is AWESOME. It took me years to fully understand it. It is a great mystery and the surprises never stop. The whole idea of \"The Dip\" is pure genius.\"Roger Rabbit\" has everything, and more, that a movie needs to be great. A great plot, lovable heroes (Eddie, Roger, Bennie the Cab and Jessica), great villains (Doom and his weasels) and wonderful special effects. This movie is truly one of the best accomplishments in film.",

            "content": "I morally hated how Judge Doom subjected a cute little toon shoe to that liquid! If it made an ugly noise, fine. Eddie was sure a tough, but decent hero who saved Roger from this fate and Toontown from Armageddon. I can't stand to see Woody Woodpecker, Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny, Daffy and Donald Duck, Betty Bo, Goofy, Pinnochio, Tinker Bell, Yosemite Sam, Elmer, Porky Pig, Pluto, Pooh, Baby Herman, Jessica or especially Roger get destroyed by the dip. I am sure glad Doom was destroyed by that dip. He was the worst villain to conceal his identity as a toon. If toons in our world came to life and attacked everyone for no reason, I'd unleash my secret weapon: iron, a special armor that toons can use to protect themselves against the dip!",

I'm still not entirely sure how the producers got all the various studios with their much loved characters to all appear in the film, but they did. And it makes for one of the best cinematic experiences of the past 50 years. And yes, I really do stand by that. It's a wonderful wonderful film.",

An interspecies murder. One reluctant detective, one dumb Roger Rabbit and his hot wife. Jessica Rabbit....Lord have mercy.But I digress. Who Framed Roger Rabbit fused film noir, hardboiled detectives and homages to old school cartoons. I want to see the contracts that the lawyers made up in order to have all those cartoon characters in there. Cameos galore. I bought the VHS copy for a dollar at my library. They told me that the DVD's had edits on it, and I didn't want that. Censorship for the sake of censorship is not good. You knew the stuff was risky 20 years ago, and now you want to try to rectify the (supposed) mistakes? Get real. It won 4 Oscars and deserved every one of them. I wish they had created a sequel. But this one stands the test of time.",

I can say that it was a very original and incredible way of telling a story, blending the world of cartoons into the world of humans (from what I remember of it. I was very young). Robert Zemeckis is now one of my favourite directors. I have since then become a movie buff, as you can tell, and this was probably what started my obsession with telling stories. I already liked cartoons, but the fact that this consisted of both cartoon and real-life worlds put my faith back in the real world. If I get the opportunity to see this one again, I wouldn't just watch it, I would keep it!",

            "review_title": "Brilliant horror",
            "content": "The eighties' classic and technical marvel Who Framed Roger Rabbit, for all its singing, dancing animals and deliberately toonish direction, is above all a horror movie. A chilling, twisted, bizarre and surreal experience which is unlike anything released before or after it (that I've laid my eyes on, anyway). The interaction between man and toon is enough to make you uneasy, as it in my opinion just looks plain wrong. Animated characters should stay within their animated environments; in the real world, their slightly unreal presence is like something out of a bad dream or hallucination. But it is in the film's final scenes, in a genuinely shocking twist, that the true nature of Roger becomes clear. Take my word for it, this is in no way a film for children. (On a completely different note, Betty Boop definitely should've had more screen time.) Acting and voice acting is solid. Christopher Lloyd is superb as always, an underrated actor, seemingly born for this type of role. I don't think it would be hyperbole to call Lloyd's Doom one of the best on-screen villains. The Doom character is one of absolute inspiration and originality, and a part that could only have been done justice by someone with Lloyd's understanding of the material. With only a handful of scenes, he leaves the strongest impact on the viewer. Especially his final scenes are nothing short of unforgettable. If you haven't seen the film yet, you're probably skeptic. I know I'd find it hard to believe that a film about a goofy rabbit with a speech impediment could be unsettling. But it is, and if you watch with an open mind, I guarantee that you will be as weirded out as I was. Now please, don't get me wrong; Roger Rabbit is both a functional murder-mystery and a chuckle-worthy comedy, and both elements are competently handled by Zemeckis (at the peak of his creativity here). But to me, who was in the presumed target audience by the time I first laid eyes on the film, Roger Rabbit will always be a spine-chilling creation. It is horrifying, and it is a must-see, for those who are ready to tumble down Zemeckis' warped rabbit's hole.",

Everyday, I would put the video into my VCR, and just be entertained at all the wacky slapstick humor that went on, in this movie.As I got older, I thought I wouldn't like the movie like I had use to, when in fact I had appreciated the movie even more. It was then I knew this movie was the one movie that anyone can watch and still love it, even after childhood.Allow me to explain: When your a kid, all you see is real-life people and cartoon characters coming together in a silly who-dun-it, movie. That's it! However, once you get older, you begin to realize more than that. You see as to WHY Roger Rabbit was the one being framed. Who the killer is, and why s/he did it. Plus, the purpose to Eddie Valiant's brother being talked about throughout the movie. That, and the plot itself.I have seen other childhood movies, only to look at them and see it as a movie only meant for children, such as \"Wizard of Oz\", \"Willie Wonka\", \"Cinderrella\", and many others. But this movie stands out. This one doesn't always have those child-like humors, like the others do. I'm not saying that it's a bad thing to have that kind of humor, I'm only saying this movie is more down-to-earth, than the others.I don't know many movies have this kind of charisma that \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" does, so believe me when I say a movie like this is something one can watch again, and again, even after childhood.",

The Toons in this movie are the same as the jews, the blacks, or any group that has been persecuted at some point.  They have their own little ghetto in Toon Town.  The villians of this movie are the humans who want to do some ethnic cleansing. There's some ironic twists in the story that notably reflect the Nazi movement in Germany, but could be applied to any form of racism.  Really a great and funny film that gets less credit than it deserves.",

            "content": "Steven Spielberg was on a roll in the 80s... first \"Jaws\", then \"Poltergeist\", then \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\" Which ones best? That would be the most recent one. This one. It's a cartoon about a busty broad who's married to a rabbit (reference to f-ing like a rabbit, rabbits have lots of sex), and she wants to get off one and the subway system is taking over the whole country as a metaphor for the federal government/Illuminati/Anton La Vey's Church of Satan. There's a lot of crude jokes at the expense of the bunny in this movie.The main selling point of this movie is the special effects, which have actually been trumped by more recent and similar fair such as \"Ted\" and \"Ted 2\", which are better movies because they are more recent... but still, I've heard it said in the school of film criticism that it is important to pay tribute to the past, and give the old movies perfect scores for trying. With that said, I think this film tries very hard but a lot of it looks terrible. Similar to how movies like \"Toy Story\" look terrible now even though it sold as a gimmick in the old times because it was a movie made with computer technology. They didn't have computers in the 80s, but this movie has other kinds of special effects like putting fake puppets into the movie.Bob Hoskins from \"Super Mario Bros.\" makes a cameo in this movie as an old-fashioned detective, and he gets his fair sure with the TITular broad. The main character is actually played by a rabbit, and it's a Pee Wee Herman type show when he's involved, and he actually smells a lot. The movie made a lot of money back in the day, and it was kind of a big deal because you could buy a lot of merchandise. A little known fact is that the movie is actually based on a book, and in the book Roger Rabbit was a comic book character instead of a cartoon character. He's a metaphor for a black minstrel which is why he is portrayed as sub-human.",
