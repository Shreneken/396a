            "content": "A visually beautiful film, which boasts one of the most poetic and literary scripts ever- the dreamlike poetry of the dialogue fits seamlessly in with the overpowering visuals. The acting is of very high callibre too, with Peter Falk adding a very welcome dimension to the film and Bruno Ganz proving a master at acting via expression and nuance. The storyline is nice and simple and is given much additional poignancy and depth by the way Wenders directed, Henri Alekan photographed and the choice of music for certain scenes- the use of Nick Cave's \"The Carney\" is especially perfect for the scene in which it was used, as was the music during the main scene where we get to see Marion's Trapeze act- the music, visual mastery and the act itself combine to stunningly entrancing effect. That 100 people have given this film a 1/10 mark is almost beyond belief, as it is an absolute joy from start to finish. Rating:- ***** (out of *****)",

            "content": "If my grandchildren ever ask me what it was like back in the Cold War, I'll tell them to watch this movie. It is both frighteningly bleak and lyrically beautiful. It captures the spirit of the times (Western civilization immediately before the fall of the Berlin Wall) better than any movie I've ever seen. And it manages to be a love letter to those times while also showing the place and time in all its inescapable ugliness. The overall plot moves forward pretty nicely for a movie where plot doesn't seem to matter all that much, and there are some beautiful vignettes, beautifully photographed, acted, and directed. I'm not sure how anyone can make it through the movie without falling in love with Bruno Ganz's angel. I think the movie's lyricism holds up well on multiple viewing -- as long as you liked it the first time. If the self-consciously art-house form bugs you, however, or you find the screenplay's \"poetry\" to be too facile, you'll probably find this movie grating. I, however, have never seen people reading silently in a public library without thinking of this movie . . . .",

            "content": "There are so many comments written about this movie, I almost don't want to write anything - but here I am anyway :)Though everyone is entitled to their own opinion, it disturbs me to read negative comments that WOD is 'too slow' or that Wenders should have been a still life photographer. I think that some people are missing the point of this movie. Wenders filmed this after having been part of the Hollywood machine for several years, and had grown sick of the cookie cutter films that were (and still are) being made in that tradition to produce ticket sales. Yes, this movie doesn't have loads of action and car chase scenes and guns and sex. It does offer some interesting perspectives. The consistent third person view and 'objectification' of the viewer is one aspect. Watching WOD, you don't feel the typical draw into the movie as so often is the case, but rather are a bystander, looking through a window, with your own thoughts and ideas a part of the movie, not the other way around. WOD doesn't allow you to become a subjective part of the film; it 'pushes' you away from empathizing. Even the camera angles and shots motivate this sentiment. The goal and direction of the film are presented without struggle or thought; you know that Damiel wants to be with Marion. He tells Cassiel this, and the only question is - how will he achieve this goal? WOD belies a sense of traditional film-making. Peter Falk is presented as perhaps the 'idea' of history as fans call out 'Colombo!' The angels are bound to Berlin, existing in a purgatory neither heaven or hell, unable to communicate. The trapeze artist from a traveling circus representing freedom - not only freedom from an everyday lifestyle, but also the key to Damiel's freedom. This movie contains so many interesting ideas and perspectives, that when watched with an open, curious mind, it is fascinating, mesmerizing, calming and inspirational. Filmed entirely in Berlin, the city is not a traditional definition of beautiful. But the industrial, modernist, post WW II reconstructed Berlin is stunning and diverse, providing the perfect background for this modern classic. I cannot recommend this movie enough. But please watch it with open eyes. In the same sense you cannot listen to the music of Schoenberg or Stravinsky as you would Mozart, you cannot watch Wings of Desire as you would a Spielberg movie.",

            "content": "\ufeffIn the first scenes after the opening credits, we see an aerial view of Berlin, but this is a Berlin that doesn't exist anymore.  It's a city divided, between East and West, that still bears the scars of the second World War, and can't rebuild where the Wall stands in the way.  There is a vast vacant lot where the cultural center of pre-war Berlin stood, with the facade of an old station, and nearby stands a bomb-shelter and the tower of a bombed-out church.It is from this church where an angel stands looking out over the city, and then we see the people going about their daily lives.  All this is shot in black and white, and we realize that we are seeing the world through the angel's eyes, seeing the same colorless world and hearing the same thoughts of the people around.  As the story goes on, we realize that this is not just one angel in Berlin, for he goes to a car showroom, and compares observations with another angel.  Then we go to the library, which is filled with angels.The first library scene is my favorite scene of the whole movie.  It is here where we see many different people studying, and their thoughts reverberate around the space until they are just a murmur, which becomes music.  Because there are so few distinct voices, it doesn't matter that they are in German, which I don't understand.  However, there was one young man studying the creation story of Genesis in Hebrew, which ties in with a later point where the two lead angels are discussing how they witnessed creation.  First they saw the glacier recede, then fish and animals appear.  They laughed when they saw the first biped, someone who shared their image, but they stopped laughing when the people learned how to make war.As idyllic as the angels' lives are, it is through the pain we humans endure that know we are fully alive.  And this is what the angels miss, to see colors, to touch, to taste, to smell, the ability to love and affect others' lives.  The children can see them, but the adults may at times only feel some vague presence.  They lay hands on people's shoulders, to try to understand their feelings beyond mere words.  This is illustrated by a scene on a rooftop, where a man is about to commit suicide; as he sits on the ledge, an angel lays a hand on him as if holding him back, and when he jumps, the angel shouts `no!'  For these angels are observers, spending their time being a presence among the living, not just to primarily serve as ushers to the afterlife (where I was sorely disappointed after watching \"City of Angels,\" the American re-make).  They are not harbingers of doom, but benign symbols of a creator's concern for humans.Don't be turned off by the fact that it's in black and white, because one thing that really makes an impact is that it's only through viewing as an angel is it in monochrome, because when humans see the world, it's in color. A poem continues throughout the movie and ties everything together, repeating \"When the child was a child...\" and we realize that humans are the children, the ones younger than angels, just learning and enjoying life. The music adds a lot to the movie, since this film is more visual than verbal, which means that subtitles don't get in the way.  I can't say enough about this film\u0096it's wonderful!",

            "content": "Many reviewers here fawn over this film and dismiss anyone who does not share their worship as being juvenile or a philistine. I've watched enough films to know whether a film is truly profound or whether it is pretentious. Wings of Desire sways towards the latter.It has a great premise- angels (not winged creatures but men in cool black coats, similar to the portrayal of the dead in Orphee) watch over late eighties Berlin, observing the humans they see around them. One angel (Bruno Ganz) falls in love with a mortal trapeze artist (Solveig Dommartin). You would think that this would be a winning formula and therefore a brilliant film. I was disappointed to find out that although it may not be a bad film, it is by no means a brilliant one.The cinematography is great, although the monochrome angels and technicolour humans had already been done 40 years previously. We get some great shots of urban Berlin, which gives the film an interesting cultural context. It almost acts as a time capsule, and had Wenders concentrated on this aspect of the film, the film would not seem as unfocused and vague as it does.The worst part of the film is the dialogue, which is pseudo-philosophical naval gazing. I don't mind introspective dialogue but when every sentence is some vague existential musing, I tend to tune out, which is fatal for this film as the action is essentially in their internal monologues. The trapeze artist's final monologue could have worked had the whole film not been composed in that way but the monologue is basically a repetition of what has been constantly repeated throughout the film. Some arty types might forgive this because they see it as some universal truth but for most, it is simply repetitive to the point at which it becomes meaningless.I forgot the love story! Seems that Wenders did that too because it only makes an appearance in the last half-hour or so of the film, although there were tiny hints earlier on. Because the romance is so unprominent for most of the film, when it finally comes to it, you wonder why the film was two hours long and not one hour. Apart from the misjudged monologue by the trapeze artist, it is quite a romantic scene. Her dress is stunning.Potentially a great thought-provoking film but self-indulgence on the director's/writers' part causes the film to feel unfocused and vague. The film tries to deny its artificiality by adding in lots of 'profound' dialogue but there are many points in the film where it comes off as very superficial. It's a bit like a New Romantic pop video.",

Co-writer/director Wim Wenders spins a visually stunning tale of angels living in Berlin before the wall came down.  As they float through the lives of all they encounter, one of them falls in love with a beautiful and lonely trapeze artist.  He soon must choose whether or not it is worth sacrificing the endless grace of being an earth-bound angel to know what it is like to be human, to \"see at eye level.\"After having seen this film eight times or so, I can safely say that it is my favorite movie of all time.  I have to watch it at least once a year and every time I do, I discover a new detail, while still being enchanted by the things that made me love this film in the first place.  Although leisurely paced, every scene makes a valuable point about how our lives are touched by divinity every day.",

            "review_title": "poetry in motion",
            "content": "Compelling, ponderous, exasperating, enigmatic, demanding and beautiful: Wim Wenders' rediscovery of his native Germany from its most symbolic city is all this and more. His spellbinding portrait of Berlin, past and present, is poetry in motion: a haunting, hypnotic masterpiece that lingers in the memory long after its final image fades from the screen.From the opening aerial shots to the last (admittedly long-winded) soliloquy, the film is a provocative look at a world that has long since lost its innocence, as witnessed by a pair of benevolent guardian angels invisibly cataloguing human daydreams and emotions, and occasionally offering mute comfort in moments of private spiritual crisis. In the divided city of Berlin what they most often overhear are poetic expressions of longing and despair, but it isn't enough to stop one empathetic angel from trading in his wings for a chance to experience all the mundane, earthbound luxuries of mortal life, from something as simple as a cup of hot coffee to something as complicated as falling in love.In less sensitive hands the idea might never have gone beyond a simple romantic fantasy (as in the inevitable Hollywood remake, starring Nicholas Cage), but Wenders and co-writer Peter Handke are more interested in making the film a vicarious tour of the human condition, overheard in passing: an infant's first joyous observations; the final thoughts of an auto accident victim; the calm resignation of a man on the brink of suicide; and the recollections of an actor (Peter Falk, playing himself, but with a whimsical twist) on location during the making of a war movie.Wenders' typically moody soul searches aren't always easy to sit through, but the unexpected element of fantasy lifts the film completely out of the ordinary, and the soaring imagery (shot mostly in luminous black and white) goes a long way toward balancing the occasional clutter of repetitive prose-poetry during the sometimes protracted interior monologues. Viewers may find it either exhilarating or annoying, but behind all the angst and alienation is a stubborn, almost childlike faith in the benevolence of human nature.",

            "content": "It's amazing that any non-German speakers can even appreciate this movie. True the basic story is universal and beautiful, but it's Peter Handke's poetry that makes it breathtaking. Wenders had done other Handke works in film - Alice in the Cities, The Lefthanded Woman, The Goalie's fear of the Penalty- but this one is very different.This movie is about giving up the ethereal life of the observer and actually living it. Handke had lived as a hermit after his wife's suicide and raised their child alone for 10 years - claiming all he needs of a woman is a good prostitute every so often. This movie script marks his turn to the pure love of life that this dreary Goth never really displayed, even in his youthful writings. It's the wonder of the child within discovering life in all it's beauty -- in even the most mundane and everyday things.************ PLOT SPOILER ALERT ***********The job the angels that nobody seems to have noted here is this: They can exist in all times flowing through one spot (Berlin) and must record instances of Humansexpressing \"Spirit\".A damned rare thing, it's true, but they must record it whenever they can.Hollywood chose to leave that notion completely out of that horrible Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan \"Vehicle\" remake.(Worth it for the Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Mick Harvey's Crime and the City Solution alone)",

            "content": "Only 3 years after the unforgettable \"Paris, Texas\" (1984), Wim Wenders presented us with another masterpiece: \"Wings of Desire\" (or \"The Sky Above Berlin\" in the original German title), a mesmerizing film about the joy of life, partially inspired by Rainer Maria Rilke's (1875-1926) poetry.The story of the angel Damiel (the excellent Bruno Ganz, who'd play Adolf Hitler 17 years later in the Oscar-nominated \"Downfall\"), who falls in love with a mortal circus acrobat, Marion (Solveig Dommartin, Wenders's then-girlfriend, who died last January) and wishes to become human is told by breathtaking images (cinematographer Henri Alekan's courtesy - he worked on Cocteau's \"La Belle et la B\u00eate\") - the angels see in black and white, humans see in colors; philosophical, analytical observations about human life (and death); scenes of beauty in the simplest things in a masterful way that never becomes corny or boring. More than a film director, Wim Wenders is a film poet; his films are fabulous intersections of image and sound (dialogue, music) crafted in a way that only some other masters achieved. \"Dedicated to all the former angels, but especially to Yasujiro, Fran\u00e7ois and Andrej\", \"Wings of Desire\" is a gorgeous celebration of life who should be seen by people aged 8 to 80. My vote: 10/10.P.S.: Avoid at all costs the ridiculous Hollywood remake, \"City of Angels\" (1998), with Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan.",

            "content": "In West Berlin, still surrounded by the Berlin Wall, angels Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) spend their time observing human life and comforting those in need of it. They compare their observations, and marvel at the joys, quirks and special moments that are experienced by humans. When Damiel overlooks lonely trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he falls in love, and the desire to leave his observational duties behind overwhelms him, and he ponders the idea of 'taking the plunge' and becoming re-born himself. He and Cassiel have also taken a special interest in visiting actor Peter Falk (playing himself) who is in town to shoot a World War II movie.The opening half an hour of this film is simply one of the most beautiful openings to a film I've ever seen. It is incoherent, and drifts seemingly randomly from person to person, as we hear their inner thoughts and experiences. Damiel and Cassiel drift around a busy library that is full of fellow angels comforting those studying and seeking answers. Even those in distress seem to please Damiel, as it is one of the things that makes us human. His life so far has been full of mere observation, and he longs for pain, worry, or fear, or something that will finally allow him to actually feel something. As much as this film is about humanity, it is equally about war.As Damiel and Cassiel walks the streets of the still war-scarred Berlin, they discuss how they witnessed the First Days. They saw the first river reach it's shore, and the very first animals appear. They talk about they both laughed when the first human appeared, being born in their image, and opening it's mouth to say its first word. Was it 'oh' or 'ah', they try to recall. But then they stopped laughing when the humans discovered war. The Berlin in Wings of Desire is still full of rubble and half-destroyed buildings, and the inhabitants are still very much effected by the war. Cassiel takes a special interest in an old man named Homer, who is looking for Potsdamer Platz. Laid to waste during war and still lying desolate, the man only finds a chair in a field and graffiti-stained walls. He wishes for an 'epic of peace'.But as well as portraying the dark side of humanity, it also celebrates the best of it. When Damiel comes across Peter Falk at a coffee stand, Falk feels his presence. He talks about how when he is cold, he rubs his hands together to warm up, and how good it feels. Damiel watches him in awe, and longs for the taste of coffee and a cigarette. When Damiel finally takes the plunge, the film turns from beautiful sepia monochrome into fully-realised colour. It's the same effect done in A Matter of Life and Death. It's a simple yet beautiful statement about how we can miss the things that are right in front of us, if we fail to just open our eyes.It's a sentimental film that if anybody else's hands may have come across as patronising or whimsical. But Wenders directs with such as beauty and a poetry that it never feels preachy. He focuses on the basic human emotions and dissects them in such a complex way that is rarely seen in cinema - he also did a similar thing with his powerful Paris, Texas. An absolutely wonderful film that is truly one of the most moving and beautiful I've ever seen, and a true and a honest depiction of the human spirit. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

It could work as a silent movie, no words, just a stunning look at 1980s Berlin and some of its people. The words, luckily, are something rare, too. They are overtly poetic and profound, bordering on pompous, but uplifted and augmented by the photography so beautifully, you go along with all the deep thoughts, which are actually layered and subtle and interesting. Add yet again what you might call a plot--the visiting by angels and their listening in on the human condition, and indeed their questioning their own dilemma as eternal beings without the weight of being truly alive--and you have a scenario that matters. This isn't just an artistic tour-de-force. It actually matters, and it puts the point well, making the dogmatic ordinary.And that, for two hours, is the film. For me, I was mesmerized through the first half. Just when it might get repetitive, a twist occurs, like the film within the film (briefly), or the Peter Falk as Peter Falk element that recurs. Once or twice, color scorches the screen in a beautiful surprise, and eventually the meaning of the color (suspected early on) is confirmed. By the last half hour, there are times when the words, extended into long monologues, make you itchy. The movie seems a little long. But you have been so engrossed earlier, you don't completely mind, but watch it through, and see an ending that might, in a weird way, be disappointing on purpose. You'll have to see it to get what I mean. A completely original special film.",

            "content": "Invisible (or occasionally visible only to children's beady eyes) angels are wandering among us, telepathic to our inarticulate thoughts, but ocularly, lives in a black-and-white realm, sometimes hovering above with a God's eye-view, sometimes passing us by like an apparition, sometimes contemplating our misery with utter poignancy, but they are unable to interact with neither a mortal's live nor the physical world, all they can do is observing, listening, extending a conciliatory but discarnate hand when empathy hits hard, in Wim Wenders' WINGS OF DESIRE, that is the price for a bystander's infinite existence.In West Berlin, just a few years before the demolition of that infamous wall, two angels Damien (Ganz) and Cassiel (Sander), dwelling in Berlin State Library, among others, confer about their philosophy, their year-round observance and their mission on earth, and divergence starts to crystallize when Damien gets particularly attached to a trapeze performer Marion (Dommartin, in her film debut), submerged entirely in her lonesomeness. Before her circus disbands, and encouraged by an erstwhile angel, the actor Peter Falk, COLUMBO himself, who forsook immortality 30 years ago, Damien decides to follow suit in pursuit of fulfilling his providential encounter with Marion; meanwhile a stolid Cassiel, closely follows an old man Homer (the swan song of the octogenarian Curt Bois, for an extraordinary career spanning over seven decades), sauntering around the city for the remnant of his war-ravaged past, becomes increasingly distressed after witnessing a young man's suicide and refuses Peter's overtures, remains his angelic form against the inexpressible torment as his deathless burden. Wenders' humanistic inclination melds fittingly with Peter Handke's poetic text, namely, the seminal and recurring poem SONG OF CHILDHOOD, monologized from Damien's perspective. It is not a fluke that he was crowned BEST DIRECTOR in Cannes, Wenders takes a great leap of faith in furnishing viewers with those sublime aerial craning shots and meditative dolly sequences, to say nothing of presenting Marion's nail-biting acrobatic performance, and the dichotomy between Angel's sepia-inflected monochrome and a varicolored human world totally nails the tonal shift that lends the film a timeless luster of cinematic appeal, which is not solely on the eye level, but plunges deep into one's psyche, to cogitate on humanity through a purely existential ground. Bruno Ganz is singularly expressive with his soul-reaching gazes and as a newly born human, he manifests a touching impression of elation and amazement that almost becomes mesmeric to behold; also, a supple Solveig Dommartin, gallantly conquers both senses of garish and ethereal while kills it on the trapeze, whereas Peter Falk relishes in his meta-presence with gusto and geniality. Gingered up with live rendition from Simon Bonney's Crime & The City Solution and Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, WINGS OF DESIRE holds dear in its heart the most elemental sensation of being alive, and at the same time, formulates a lucid message to mankind's inescapable pathos, a knockout, through and through.",

They also are bored and see that while they have eternity, the don't have the passion and joy that comes from occasional suffering. As they attempt to find a way to bring love into the world, they can't really experience. When they see joyfulness in the young lady, they see her as having made the best of a bad situation and one of them desires to be human (which he does). The idea of angels is one of those myths (I'm sorry) that people created to connect with what they cannot fathom, the idea of a God. These guys are the intermediaries. They put human form to the spiritual. When we survive a difficult time or we gain some sort of favor or accomplishment, it's easy to place our reward in the hands of an angel. He is us but not us. The film is ethereal and sad. Funny and tragic. It's quite well done in that European way: stark images, magical black and white contrasts, and subtle presentation. I hope to see that sequel soon.",

            "content": "Such a lovely film. It's ethereal, celestial, and simply beautiful. It gives us a view of humanity as if from above, from a distance, and through a long view of history, and yet it's also incredibly intimate, probing into the thoughts of various people and reflecting their loneliness, longing, and struggle. It's touched with pathos and yet grace. The childlike questions that recur are simple and yet so profound, revealing the randomness of not only who we're with in life, but our own identities as well. The oneness of all beings is so beautifully put in the line \"No mortal child was conceived, only an immortal shared image,\" and yet our ultimate isolation is reflected the line right before it, \"Who in the world can claim that he was ever truly together with another being?\" These opposites and contrasts seem to so perfectly capture the human condition.It's not a film that's heavy on plot, and in what we do see, there is a good deal of symbolism. On the movie set, where actors play out the roles of historical people, it could be seen as representing how real people play their roles on the stage of life. In the trapeze artist in the circus, who gracefully executes an act that is precariously high above her audience, it could be seen as our own anxiety-inducing performances in life at times. To have all this with the footage of mankind's atrocities during the war and the backdrop Berlin Wall still in place, graffiti covered and overlooking desolate lots and construction sites ... it's just extraordinary. Director Wim Wenders, cinematographer Henri Alekan, and actors Bruno Ganz and Solveig Dommartin are all brilliant, and the soundtrack fits the mood of the film perfectly. The dedication to Ozu, Truffaut, and Tarkovsky at the end was a nice touch too. This is one with several goosebump inducing moments, and I couldn't recommend it more highly.One more quote:\n\"No more roaming back and forth through the centuries as in the past. Now I can only think from one day to the next. My heroes are no longer warriors and kings, but the things of peace, one just as good as the next. The drying onions as good as the tree trunk that crosses the marsh. But no one has thus far succeeded in singing an epic about peace. What is it about peace that its inspiration is not enduring? Why is its story so hard to tell?\"",

            "content": "\"Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin\" is probably my favorite Wim Wenders movie. It also helped that Bruno Ganz is one of my favorite actors. And so is Peter Falk. Really enjoyed his many Colombo references as I am a great fan of the show. This movie is a thing of beauty, never pretentious and never drags during its roughly 2 hours of runtime. Awards shows all over the planet, including the BAFTAs agreed and Wenders won a Palme d'Or in Cannes for directing it. I really liked how the world was black and white for him when he was an angel and in color when he was a human. Some of the quotes in this film get mentioned several times, by different characters. That's not a problem at all though, as the approach and backgrounds are truly interesting when each of the characters say these quotes. For example I liked the part said by Ganz' character a lot when he talks about \"the child who was a child\" and he is that child in this metaphor as he was basically just born as a human being.Another thing this film is worth a watch for are the many contemporary references, such as the Berlin Wall, the Nick Cave concert or just the many known places in Berlin in general. It's especially interesting for people who live (or have lived) in this city. I am not sure if this is my favorite Bruno Ganz performance as he has many great turns and here the script is also a highlight. Otto Sander I was never a great fan of. Maybe that is why I did not like the sequel (after the Fall of the Berlin Wall) as much as this one, but he gives a decent performance here. Solveig Dommartin (who died far too young) is also great as a trapeze artist. I liked all the ways in which they could hear the people's thoughts and the scream of shock when one character commits suicide. That's the most tragic scene of the film perhaps.There are just so many details which make this movie as good as it is and I could write a whole novel about these. But I won't, you just have to experience it yourself. One early example would be how the central character stands atop of a church and looks like a statue from below. The people watching this scene are wowed, but they don't see Damiel, which we don't know yet at this point. They are simply stunned by the beautiful church. If you know Rammstein's song \"Engel\" this is maybe the poetic beautiful film version of how the central character does not want to be an angel. I have not seen the US remake, so I cannot say if this is better or worse. It has to be extremely good though to top Wenders' work here. Highly recommended, although this is certainly not a movie for everyone I guess.",

Those who enjoyed the clear narrative style of the American interpretation will be jarred to find the original to be very different in tone and storyline than its descendant. Bruno Ganz plays a wistful angel named Damiel who wanders Berlin attending to the spiritual needs of people whose souls need a lift, all the while wishing he was human himself.  Wenders' direction is absolutely breathtaking, with gorgeous black-and-white photography, poetic dialogue that is never too overdone and a score that is haunting to say the very least. The library scene is my personal favourite (and is copied very well in City of Angels). After you've seen Wings, rent the excellent sequel Faraway, So Close with Nastassja Kinski and Willem Dafoe. >",

Of course that doesn't happen until 90 MINUTES have elapsed!Obviously, this film takes it's sweet time even setting up a plot.  For a full hour and half you see the angels walking around and hearing what they hear.  It's all somber and shot in black & white which makes it all the more depressing.  After 90 minutes I was bored and very depressed.  As other posters have said it DOES have some incredible imagery--but it's not attractive imagery.  It's all bleak and desolate.  Also the slow pace makes this very difficult to sit through.  It seems director Wim Wenders believes a film has to be slow and bleak to be art.  Well, that doesn't make it art...it makes it slow and bleak!  The acting is also pretty bad...but the director is obviously more concerned about images than acting.  And the nonstop thoughts you hear make little sense and NEVER stop! The only bright spots are some beautiful color photography and Peter Falk who is obviously enjoying himself...but damned if I knew what he was doing in this!I'm giving it a 4--and that's just for the photography.  This is basically a very overrated, pretentious film that THINKS it's making an artistic statement.  The late Pauline Kael nailed it in her review of it in the New Yorker back in 1988--she said a friend of hers didn't want the movie to end...but couldn't wait to get out of the theatre!",

            "content": "Digging deep into the thoughts and dreams of mortals and the angels who look after them, WINGS OF DESIRE is a masterfully-made work of art and Germany's finest. It matches lavish cinematography, flawless direction by Wim Winders, impressive performances and a simple plot told with such brilliance, symbolism and will.The first half of the film resembles more like a beautifully-painted mosaic or an avant-garde film showing empathy for every character brought about by the screen even showing traces of the Nazism era. Here, the idea of supernatural beings that indirectly assist humans in day-to-day life is introduced. The mystifying beings are unseen to everyone except to the young-at-heart. Hovering atop statues or wandering inside public libraries or apartments, they see and know everything as Winders etches the black-and-white world of the angels. The story evolves when one angel Damiel (Bruno Ganz) wonders what it is like to be human, how it is like to be able to feel, to hold or to be seen. Once he comes to the aid of attractive trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he feels a spiritual devotion he has never felt before.Winders' slow-but-steady rate gives time for the viewer to contemplate on the questions a child asks (\"Why am I me and why not you? Why am I here and not there? When did time begin and where did space end?\"). He allows the audience members think what they want to think in a new light instead of manipulating them. The scenario of a ghostly being falling for a human may seem overworked now (GHOST, JUST LIKE HEAVEN) but WINGS OF DESIRE is a fresh, innovative piece of cinema with remarkable photography and unbelievable performances. Henry Alekan's cinematography is both insightful and visually dazzling. Every camera angle takes on a new connotation. Ganz and Dommartin are equally irresistible as two different \"people\", who worlds apart from each other; both characters are looking for love, no matter how close Damien is from Marion. Peter Falk, playing himself, is an amusing attribute to the cast being \"Columbo\" in the popular TV show. Being a mysterious character himself, he metaphorically adds a little color to the film amidst all the spellbinding drama and discloses an entertaining revelation that helps the film progress.This revolutionary masterpiece of craftsmanship is considered by many as the greatest non-US movie ever and it deserves all of its praise entirely. WINGS OF DESIRE breaks new ground in romantic and dramatic film making. Every scene in this movie offers a chance for hope, understanding and compassion. Unbearably creative, outstanding and poignant, this superbly-made motion picture is not another art-house flick. Astounding.WINGS OF DESIRE was remade in Hollywood as the sleek yet disappointing CITY OF ANGELS(1997).",

Even after seeing it a number of times I find new, interesting and moving things in the movie.Some vignettes from the movie astound me as I see inside someone's experience or see things freshly through them. The framing poem by Peter Handke gives meaning to the whole movie. It's one of the things that I respond to most strongly.There are very minor choices in movie that I think could have been made differently, but at the same time they do not significantly detract from my enjoyment. Wim Wenders gives a lot of screen time to Solveig Dommartin as she works the trapeze and thinks to herself in her trailer. She certainly needs time to get audience's sympathy and attention among all the other characters, but some of her screen time seems a little indulgent. Also, some short glimpses into people's lives are not as effective as others--especially the later more non-specific \"noise of humanity\" sequences. The noise of humanity is well established in the library scenes and other sequences towards the first of the movie and the later less concrete vignettes do less for me than the earlier ones.The movie is more of a visual and auditory poem than a traditional plot-driven movie. Plots do exist, but they are not relentlessly forwarded by everything shown on screen. You'll do a lot of people watching and find both grimness and despair as well as joy and beauty. It's a movie about experience, humanity, and both the joy and the pain of life. If you view it receptively, there are many entire worlds within the movie that you'll be able to enter momentarily and perhaps get a better view of your own world.Watch this movie. It can be an amazing experience. You will need energy to pay attention, patience with the pacing, and a willingness to deal with some confusing aspects of the movie. If you don't have these things it might be better to come back to the movie at some other time when you feel more receptive. It is well worth the payoff, though.",

Those movies, in their own way, are magnificent and, largely, spare--especially Paris, Texas. There is a verbal reticence in Wings of Desire (or The Sky Over Berlin, which is a better title and more appropriate), but this film is absolutely lush. That it's black and white makes this lushness all the more stunning. I've written recently about Les Enfants du Paradis and how luminous the photography was in that movie. That shimmer is gone here, but Wings of Desire feels metallic (in a good way). And then there's the story...pure romance, to be sure, but handled sincerely. And, what's more, it's not simply the romance between two people--it's the romance of the world. This is a movie in love with our planet and our people and, pretty much, everything, but it's not cloying. Wim Wenders, though sincere in his love for Earth and humanity, doesn't ignore our faults or the pain and suffering that occurs here. This is a film about humanity by someone who is both frustrated and amazed by the world, and that makes this film perfect, thematically. Of course, some may argue that the movie meanders for more than an hour, but that's the point. The lives of these angels are, to an extent, desultory. Only when Damiel begins to fall in love is a discernible narrative able to develop. It's really quite an amazing bit of screen writing, in my opinion.In addition, you have the wonderful Bruno Ganz, the inimitable Peter Falk, and the beautiful Solveig Dommartin. Their performances are immaculate and, frankly, help keep a gorgeous and esoteric film grounded. Oh, and the songs by Nick Cave are perfect. All in all, this is one of the best movies to appear during the 1980s and one of the best movies to appear in the last century.

All of these topics come to mind when thinking about the film \"Wings of Desire\" directed by Wim Wenders in 1997. This film was a unique fantasy drama that had a very interesting feel to it. Throughout this movie, Damiel and Cassiel had to be pretty quiet and emotionless as angels. People couldn't see them because they were angels. They would be in the skies of the city of Berlin watching over the great people in the city. The people's feelings and thoughts would draw the angels closer. The angels would try helping the hopeless people by making them feel like they weren't alone, which was actually true. The different colors of the backgrounds in this movie truly could confuse anyone. After figuring it out, the reason behind it was pretty interesting. The angels perspective created a black and white color background. The color switched to normal colors once the movie was in perspective of real life. There wasn't much of a plot in this movie, which made it interesting. The angels would just go from person to person which made it a little random from time to time, but it wasn't overwhelming. This movie was always keeping my attention. It might not be the go-to action movie, but it's definitely an interesting and well played out movie. The ending with Damiel deciding to take a dip into a real perspective going out of his angel self was a big turning point. Seeing Damiel after that just made you into it and made you wonder. Some of the scenes drug on for a longer time than they needed. Some scenes were just way too long that didn't need to be like that at all.",

I know it's lame, but straight away I'm going to say that my favourite film of all time is probably Nicholas Roeg's 'Walkabout'. Why would I make that point? It's really just to make clear that I'm not automatically dismissive of films that aren't event driven, or feature long periods where nothing much happens.In some ways Wings of Desire isn't really about all that much and I'm not even going to try to explain the few things which do happen in the film. In another sense it's a film about absolutely everything and your interpretation and feelings toward the movie are going to depend largely on your own personality, what you expect from it and various other factors, including what sort of day you've had (it's very easy to space out during this movie!). The first two thirds of the movie are spent wondering what it is you're actually watching, as there's not really much in the way of dialogue (at least not much of interest). The final third of the film gives us some sort of resolve to the film, although really by this point most viewers are likely to be bored out of their mind. If I had to pick a scene which sums the movie up then it'd have to be the one where the angels are discussing what it is they lack in their existence. It seemed to go on forever and I couldn't really have cared less by the end of it, because they cite too many examples. If you think this sounds harsh, take a look through the quotes section on this movie to get an idea of what you'll be hearing throughout.There's no doubting that this film is well filmed and visually it's very impressive. It's an unusual film too and one which immediately grabs your attention. However, despite these qualities, the 'introduction' is just far too long and drawn out. The director could easily have covered the first hour in about 15 minutes. And I know some people would argue that this is to give us a sense of what it's like to live forever and all the rest, but it's really not necessary. In movies there are ways of conveying long periods of time. Flashbacks, a montage etc. But there's really no excuse for the way this movie starts, it takes forever to get going and the ending is totally unsatisfying.If you like your movies arty then check it out for the visuals alone, but if you like some sort of entertainment or something which is actually going to occupy your brain in some way then I'd avoid it.",

But there's nothing here which will try to appeal to your immediate senses. This is a poignantly beautiful metaphysical excursion on what it means to be human. Wim Wenders has recognized the metaphysical nature of the movie by dedicating it to Truffaut, Ozu and especially Tarkovskij. And everything -- the bleakness of the landscape, the ubiquity of the Berlin wall, the anguish in which the characters are immersed -- acquires a deeper meaning when we see it through the eyes of two angels. And the sky over Berlin, with its angels, is the only thing that keeps together two painfully divided sides of the city, and the only perspective from which to see it as one.But handle with care: if you're looking for a movie with an enthralling plot, a clear language and a reasonable pace, you'll be disappointed. The first time I saw this movie with a friend we laughed all the way. I've seen it more 5-6 times now and I've stopped laughing. I sit there and I'm mesmerized.The movie was born without a script and it is a melting pot with dialogues by Peter Handke, improvised monologues by the actors, connecting material written by Wim Wenders. In one example, Wenders indulges too long in a scene just because he regrets removing it due to all the work the actress has made for preparing to be a trapezist. This is clearly against all rules and all common sense.Despite all this the movie works and the reason is, the movie somehow manages to touch deep strings all the way through, because of its beautiful imagery (thanks to director of photography Henri Alekan), its eerie soundtrack, the disorderly collection of truly poetic dialogues/monologues, very inspired acting, and the impredictable combined effect of all this -- surely beyond what was planned by Wim Wenders himself. Should I add that the movie has created its own language for making its point?The film has also become an incredible documentary on Berlin just before the fall of the wall.",

            "content": "From director Wim Wenders (The American Friend; Paris, Texas), the title of this German film sounded like something that would be highly rated by the critics, especially appearing in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, it was only rated three out of five stars, but it wasn't going to stop me watching it. Basically in contemporary West Germany, while the Berlin Wall still stood, Damiel (Downfall's Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) are two angels invisible to all humans, besides very young children and people close to death, and they wander the city watching various people. They give help to the lonely and depressed souls that they can, but Damiel has become unhappy with the centuries of immortality and longs to become a human so he can blend into the world he adores and is fascinated by so much. One of the biggest reasons he wants to experience the joys of everyday human life is because he has been watching in particular lonely circus trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), he has fallen in love with her, but of course physical interaction is impossible. Cassiel also wishes to be human as well, but Damiel is able to strip himself of his immortality, and he wakes up from the black and white into the colourful real world and experiences at last what it is like to be human, bleeding, eating food and drinking coffee, and wearing regular clothing. Cassiel meanwhile unintentionally finds himself connected with a young man who wants to commit suicide, but still an angel he cannot do anything to stop him, and when he does take his own life Cassiel is haunted by event. Damiel finally gets to meet Marion in person, and it is obvious that there is some kind of familiarity between them, despite never meeting in real life, and they get closer by the end of the film, where it says To Be Continued... (concluding in the sequel Faraway, So Close!). Throughout the film, Columbo actor Peter Falk shows up to give his incites into city and human life, with a strange knowledge for everything, including the existence of angels, apparently he used to be one himself. Also starring Curt Bois as Homer the aged poet. Ganz gives a good sensitive performance as the angel wanting to be human and in love, Dommartin is nice as his love interest, and Falk is witty and likable as himself. The film was remade in a few aspects into the Nicolas Cage/Meg Ryan film City of Angels, the romantic element certainly, and despite some of the story being a little predictable, there are some great small effects and cinematography, it a worthwhile fantasy drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language. Good!",

The first time I saw it, I thought it was magical, there was something about the shared experience of sitting in a theater surrounded by people who were all watching the same film. Well, like a lot of arthouse films, it doesn't translate to a TV screen when you're sitting at home alone watching it. The inner dialogue becomes mind-numbingly tedious, and the casting of Peter Falk as himself in retrospect seems little more than a gimmick, there is a long pointless exchange between himself and a wardrobe coordinator about a hat, intended to demonstrate his humanity I suppose but it comes off as pedantic. After that bit of comedy, we return to the long, expansive, inner monologue philosophizing that fills much of the film until you're ready to scream. Some films do not translate well to television, and this is one of them. You people who are voting this film a10, I wish that I could transport you back to San Francisco in 1987 to see this film in a theater, that was an experience.",

When I say a lot of time, I should stress over half of the film's length. Eventually one of the angels decides he wants to be human because he fell for a trapeze artist. But it takes a very long time for the film to get there. There's also a subplot about Peter Falk (playing himself) shooting a movie in Berlin. Falk's part is probably the most enjoyable part of the film. Other than the beautiful photography. Look, it's a very pretentious movie. Obviously how much you will enjoy it depends in large part upon how you feel about films like this. It's the kind of movie you feel like you should be wearing a scarf while watching it. There is some good stuff here but it also reminded me of an episode of The Simpsons from years ago where Barney Gumble made an art film called \"Pukahontas\" that was pointless drivel yet the film snob phonies all praised it as a masterpiece.",

            "content": "This 1987 film by Wim Wenders was intended to be a paean to Berlin but ended up as a romantic expression of hope. It has a number of distinctive elements that make it transcend mere romance, though.Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander play two guardian angels who oversee much of the actions and thoughts going on in the divided city (the film was made in 1987). These two actors are excellent. Ganz and Sander had worked together as actors for 20 years before this film was made, and their camaraderie is obvious. Much of the film was shot in black and white by Henri Alekan, who did the cinematography for Cocteau's \"Beauty and the Beast.\" Ganz's and Sander's roles in great part are merely watching and reacting to the streams of consciousness of Berliners, and they are masterful in passively listening with their hearts on their faces. The use of black and white brings their faces into subtle, shaded relief, mirroring their inner feelings. Cinematographer Alekan (you will notice that the trapeze artist is in Circus Alekan) was born in 1909 and died in 2001. His work here reminds me of the cinematography of Kazuo Miyagawa in \"Rashomon.\" The camera work and tracking are intricate without ever being obvious, bringing focus on the actors and their faces.The score is by Jurgen Knieper. He wrote an angelic score without being campy or heavy handed. The music is understated and perfect. He uses strings and a choir to make spoken words into music that fits the scenes.The frail elderly man that wanders in and out throughout the movie represents Homer, the original story teller. Homer frets about losing his touch. He's played by Curt Bois who was born in Berlin in 1901 and who had a short scene in \"Casablanca.\" This was his final role; he died in 1991. The use of Bois is bittersweet, as he was a famous actor in Berlin in the Twenties and Thirties before he was forced by the rise of the Nazis to leave the country.Wenders surprises with his juxtapositions. In black and white we see an old man in modern Berlin get into a classic Thirties car and drive down the street. Then we see a view from within the car looking out onto a color film of 1930s Berlin full of Nazis and red flags with black Swastikas in their hearts; a cut and we see black and white film of Berliners digging out of the rubble with rows of corpses lined up beside the street as we drive by in that car. Then we arrive at a movie location in modern Berlin with actors in Nazi uniforms and Peter Falk waiting for us, and we realize we've seen what the car has seen during its life. We have a sad scene of Bois as Homer wandering near the modern Berlin Wall looking for Potsdamer Platz as it was in the Twenties and Thirties, when it was the heart of Berlin and the busiest intersection in Europe. In 1987, it was a desolate wasteland of refuse and weeds, and Homer collapses into a junked chair, weary from his fruitless search.Wenders also introduces subtle tension by giving us the thoughts of characters, showing their depression or anxiety. Then Wenders puts them into positions where we have the possibility of \"accidents\" or intentional acts. Each scene is played out slowly, without dramatic music, realistically as we watch and wait to see the outcomes. It's very nicely done without melodrama or histrionics, but like the \"lives of quiet desperation\" quote we all know.The movie seems to be best known for its soaring hope - in spite of all the wars, death, and destruction, we have guardian angels looking over us. We find that the angels envy us, and Ganz's angel crosses the river and becomes human, reveling in the human senses, seeing in color for the first time (black and white shots represent the world as seen by angels bereft of our senses), and finally finding love, the most human condition of all.\"Wings of Desire\" reminds me of a few movies. As I said earlier, \"Rashomon\" is comparable in cinematography. If you treasure the cinematographer's art, I recommend \"Wings of Desire\" and of course \"Beauty and the Beast.\" I was also reminded of Truffaut's \"Fahrenheit 451\" in the scenes where people learning books walk around giving lengthy quotations as snow fell - a condition existing in \"Wings of Desire,\" as well. Finally, I have a reaction to \"Wings of Desire\" that I had to \"Donnie Darko\": I think the director left too much to the audience to fill in. There's no real story to \"Wings of Desire,\" just a series of interior monologues, which we the audience have to string together into our own coherent whole. Some people are put off by the lack of action and plot, while others take full advantage of the opportunity to vest the movie with their own plot and feelings. \"Wings of Desire\" is definitely a movie for adult contemplation.The American film \"City of Angels\" with Nicholas Cage and Meg Ryan was loosely based on \"Wings of Desire.\" The two movies do not bear comparison; do not avoid \"Wings of Desire\" because you found \"City of Angels\" to be a sappy Hollywood romance.",

While it's first 30 minutes didn't blew my away to say the least, after some 30 minute mark i got the overall mood and most important feeling for this movie - after i finished it i can say - it's kinda great one. Kinda - because it is rough around the edges: it is not superbly paced (it drags here and there), you can clearly see when many extras are staring at the camera or crew behind it or even some bad \"acting\" from them and it kinda lacks a more strait narrative during it's first half hour. But then this movie got better, a lot.Overall, \"Wings of Desire\" is surely not for everyone. It's more like a poetry movie about the ideas, and there are many, deep and haunting ones. Acting by lead actors were very solid. Directing and screenplay are inspiring. And there is a very special appearance by Columbo himself Peter Falk as ... Peter Falk. This is a one very special appearance. And one unusually rough but kinda great movie overall.",

I have viewed this movie dozens of times and still I find the language is unfolding for meThis film is resplendent with exquisite music astutely paired with a subtle yet suggestive montage. The use of colour paints a moving and brightened aesthetic, one which drifts with the mood of the characters as well as challenges the mind and the emotions of the viewer. Furthermore, the acting is superb. One immediately is engulfed by a philanthropic warmth emmenating from the characters, notably Bruno Ganz who, I feel, becomes his character entirely. While his dialogue may be sparse, his body language and master of physical and psychic subtlety is brilliant and it becomes readily apparent that Ganz can tell a story with his entire being, not just the words that flow eloquently and effluently from him. To make a gross understatement, I was very impressed.One of the elements of this film, which I will admit I am ill qualified to discuss, was the subtle and probative examination of the modern German psyche as it comes to terms with its turbulent past, present and future and perhaps a historian should comment here. However, anyone can immediately sense that Berlin, a city that is as much alive and active as any character in this film, is a character that needs to be accounted for and a source of energy and inspiration as well as pensive recapitulation, that needs to be discussed.I could ramble on and on about this film but I should sententiously state that this is a brilliant artwork that demands full attention.",

To be honest i was really really sleepy coming into class today and when i found out that we couldn't watch it in the preview theatre, i thought to myself, \"Great, time to sleep\". Plus when i heard that the horrible \"City Of Angels\" is a remake of this film, i felt that i was in store for more of \"City Of Angels\"' type of love, angel-ish crap.I'm glad that i was totally wrong. Never doubt a film until you've watched it for yourself.Wings Of Desire is a thought-provoking movie. The type that makes you stop in your normal, day-to-day routine and think of the things we rarely pause to think about. For example, the poem at the start of the film where it begins with \"When a child is a child\" part; i felt that it made me think about how we were the most curious when we were very young. How innocent that age was and how idyllic it would be to stay that age. Alas we all grow up. Some turn out alright. Some turn out to become Hitler.Which brings me to the point of how this film really seems to be a commentary of Berlin and perhaps, post-World War II Germany in particular. There is a scene whereby the 2 angels are in a care and they are exchanging notes about the time of sunset and sunrise as well as what happened 10 years on that exact day. Then Cassiel is about to talk about what had happened 50 years ago, during the World War II, when Damiel cuts in and motions him to move on. It is as if Damiel is the voice of Germany and he is too ashamed to talk about the past. In fact it is suffice to say that all those flashbacks of WWII is to show the horrors that Germany had seen and endured throughout the years.As for the how the story is shaped. I agree that it is similar to Italian Neorealism or French New Wave due to the fact that the story lacked a strong goal. Again we can say that we cannot really tell what is going to happen from one scene to the next. And while one may feel that the less-than-normal structure is too complicated. I feel that it is good that we can watch and then try to understand the many layers of storyline that is within this film. To me, it sure beats watching that dumb \"City of Angels\".If there is a scene that stood out the most, i believe that the library scene is the most powerful one of all. First of all, the camera movement was breathtaking. It would dolly from one side of the second floor and then using a wire overhead, it would go to the other side. This gives us a sort of floating feel. And although one may argue that it is part of a distanciation effect. I would feel that the main purpose that Wim Wenders did that is to give us a feeling of how the angels would move around. They could walk like normal human beings but if need be, they could float as well. And then there was the thoughts that emanated from all over the library. One thought would echo and then another. In the end all of the murmurs would drown each other, as if to show the hundreds of thoughts that go on in the library. Simply said, this scene is magical.This film has so many layers one would feel that it would not be boring to watch it more than just one time so that all the layers are uncovered one by one. Yep, better than Citizen Kane. Wings Of Desire ist nummer ein!",

It touches difficult topics, heaven, angels, the human condition, the power of will, hope, love, and it does so with a grace and sensibility that is almost painful. On top of this, add superb acting, inspired photography, the city of Berlin, and a lot of children.It is a little sad that 17 years have passed since Wenders shot this masterpiece, and nothing that followed (from him or anybody else) came even close to it.It is not a movie that you want to watch every week, in fact one vision lasts for few years, the same way you don't need to read War and Peace more than once every ten years, and this is probably the best analogy: Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin is a classic.One more note: I enjoyed the remake (City of Angels), it was somewhat good, but it never actually crossed my mind that it was intended to be a remake of this one, so far are the two from each other.

            "content": "Following the Second World War the continent of Europe was divided not only by political beliefs and economic strife but the continent was also physically divided by a wall that was constructed through Berlin. This wall built by the satellite communist countries under the orders and pressure of Moscow to keep the ideals of the capitalist west out of their city and the minds of their people. The wall was to instate this `out of sight, out of mind' mentality in to the hearts of the people that the communist were trying so hard to control as their system was failing in the post war world economy. The wall remained intact until 1989, but during this time period a dramatic era of film was created that begged the main questions of the time: Where do I belong? What country do I call my own? Do I turn to others?Wings of Desire uses the idea of an omnipotent force that watches over the world from the beginning of time and records the actions and thoughts of man, a creature that amazes and bewilders them. This force of angles know the world and mans mannerisms through and through but yet does not truly know the extent to what man experiences and feels in everyday life. To show a stark contrast between the living world and the angles, the angels are portrayed in black. This same black and white footage is used to show East Berlin as a collection of persons who are not really living life either. They are instead people acting out the basic image of what modern life should be. As the main angle falls in love with a French circus tumbler her image switches between black and white ( as she discovers the clam feeling he brings her) to one of vibrant color after he falls from `grace.' The West side of Berlin is also shown in this collage of vibrant color as he discovers this grand new existence that he was missing.The main angle also has several interactions with an American film and TV star Peter Falk (Colombo) for the actor senses the presence of the angle. He entices the angle to give up what he has and come to earth by being one of the first actual persons to talk directly to him. The audience later is presented with Peter Falk being a previous angle that fell from `grace.' He represents temptation of what can be found when one crosses from one life path to the next. This idea is also the pressing idea of crossing from the East Berlin side to the West, of crossing from a world that is limited and controlled to one where there is unending possibility. Where man can discover all that he wants to know on his own, for it not to be feed to him.Through voice-overs, where the character does not participate in the common dialog that a script would have, the audience experiences life in this torn city through the thoughts and feelings of the people that live there. The voice-overs continually address the complex and intriguing questions that all persons could not audibly ask, for no one knew the real answer. The difficult questions of longing, unplanned futures, anxiety filled the hearts and minds of people all over the world but the people of Berlin embodied them. `History is ours, and the people make it' ( Salvador Allende 1973) is a fitting quote for the people of Berlin as they were the leaders of the world as the guided and survived such a torturous time. Wings of Desire is a film that leads the audience on a narrative that is gripping and induces thought and discussion of the world's social issues.",

One has the poetic desire to experience being human and feel authentic emotions as they feel. He also has the hots for an angelic trapeze artist as she floats high above also like an angel. Will the angel have his expectations met and will he be able to catch the attention of Ms. Trapeze? From the first frame and first two minutes, I knew this was going to be artsy and meaty, which I more often than not enjoy. It took over an hour to develop a tangible narrative as it lead off with a barrage incessant poetic ramblings. Lots of talk about the innocence of children who live without a care and how that changes as life passes. Will this angel tap into their carefree nature? A story line did finally take shape but was it too little too late?",

The dialog is often beautiful and at other times quite funny and the scene near the end of the film in which the fallen angel is at last able to be seen and touched by the woman he loves has a piece of dialog that leaves me breathless every time. What an expression of genuine love!I have taken several friends to see this movie with mixed results. Some are fascinated and others frustrated by its length and non- Hollywood structure.

I am not one to use superlatives, but I have yet to see a better film. Certainly 8 1/2, La Strada, La Dolce Vita, La Notte di San Lorenzo, Wild Strawberries, and maybe ten or so others come close, but they do not quite get to this level.What is so good? The cinematography, the language, the integration of sound and music, the character development, the pacing... in short, everything.Now, it is easy for someone raised on a diet of Bruce Willis films to think that the pacing was too slow. Art is supposed to slow our pace, to put us into contemplation, to shatter, or at least to fracture, our perception of time and space. Der Himmel uber Berlin does this in a way that is analogous to taking a long, hard look at a painting by Diebenkorn or Matisse. Like a Matisse, the viewer can experience joy at various levels, from the first, superficial glance to prolonged and repeated viewings. Perhaps one can get to a point where there is nothing more to glean from it, but that indicates a failing on the part of the viewer, not on the part of the film. However, anyone who has difficulty understanding this film should realize that it is okay not to. It is a difficult film. Perhaps it is better for the confused viewer to put it aside for the time being, to see other films, to read, to think about other things. But it would be a terrible shame not to try to come back to Der Himmel Uber Berlin. It is too great a film to ignore.",

Wings of Desire is likely the greatest film that comes at it from an opposite angle, and is amazing in a whole new way. Yes, there are depressed characters, a prostitute, a suicide. This isn't a naive film. But the overall message overcomes it all- we can focus on the positive.As a story about an angel, Damiel, who longs to be human, Wings of Desire can open a viewer's eyes as to how the physical world is not a bad place to be. We see what the angels lack that we have- colour, touch, taste, freedom. We learn we can be amazed by these things, and should be. There is something mystical to the woman who folds up her umbrella and lets herself get soaked, to the child who describes how a fern grew from dirt to an astonished teacher, to the boy who listens to The Odyssey and stops blinking. The divine and the amazing are all around us, for anyone who knows where to look.Peter Falk, who plays himself as a former angel, lays it out in his companero speech, in my opinion one of the greatest scenes in the history of cinema. It's wonderful to be here, he says, to have coffee, to rub your hands together, to draw. He offers his hand as a gesture of friendship- Damiel chooses to take it, indicating he has overcome his last bits of reluctance to \"take the plunge.\" His fellow-angel, Cassiel, who earlier couldn't help himself from smiling at the thought of mortality, does not take Falk's hand.The feel of the film, as a whole, has an otherworldly, poetic tone, thanks to screenwriters Wim Wenders and Peter Handke, the latter whom contributed Song of Childhood, which runs through the film and helps tie it together. This contributes to the stunning, awe-inspiring feel of the film, only enhanced by the Criterion Blu-ray. It's particularly the black and white scenes that benefit from the exceptional detail, sharpness and texture. Even the circus and the music of Nick Cave take on divine meaning in this film.The film ends with a \"To be continued...\" which will nag everyone to see the sequel, Faraway, So Close! (1993). It disappointingly loses the whole tone and message of the first film; the message of Faraway, So Close! appears to be \"Oops, turns out the world sucks after all. Stay away, angels.\" I don't blame The Criterion Collection for not releasing the two films as a double feature. Wings of Desire is only one film, unlike any other, and truly a stunning experience.",

The great painters like Da Vinci or Vermeer teach us that there is something spiritual in the lighting of a scene: the images in this film achieve this, as they do in Dreyer's films or Tarkovski's. Yes, spiritual, not only because there are angels in the film (with, interestingly, minimal or no mention of God or religion), which would be too obvious, but because of the dialog, the poetry (R.M. Rilke and Peter Handke), deep feelings with a touch of humor, the music, the all-encompassing verbal texture, a perfect use of B/W vs color, even a perfect use of architecture, and, why not, those angels that respect, value and cherish every human life, however lonely, despaired or miserable.If you have lived enough, this film could act on you as a mystical catalyst. If it does not, wait until you get tired of films full of explosions, car chases, deaths and nonsense. Then you will discover that you can still watch \"Wings of desire\" and enjoy a motion picture.Wim Wenders pays tribute to Ozu, Truffaut and Tarkovsky.

I had the opportunity to visit the city several times in the first decade of 21st century and it is definitely not Berlin from Wings of Desire.With a comforting premise that angels are watching over us, we follow them during their usual day. Although they don't always succeed in keeping us happy, they try their best in making our life on this Earth easier. One of them longs for human experience and is even willing to trade the eternity and sterile knowledge of all things for it. And each second of the story about it transpires with the lust for life and the love for Berlin.The closing titles reveal a dedication to Yasujir\u014d Ozu, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, and Andrei Tarkovsky.

            "content": "More people believe in Angels, than in God, its a curious fact. It may not be true, or be a fact which has just followed me. I polled three difference classrooms over the years, high school through college, same every time. Maybe its something to do with people liking nurses more than doctors, an immediate helping hand, to a distant voice of authority, a nurse with a smile and medicine, instead of the doctor with the bad news and the bill. \"The Sky Over Berlin\"(Wings Of Desire, is the hookey US title, not translation) is the only film I have ever seen to give a truly 3rd person view, a Gods Eye POV. The story is of two Angels, who observe(from always elevated camera angels), the lives and thoughts of human beings. Most of the film is from this first person black and white POV(the humans perceptive is in color), a camera floating over random people, listening into their thoughts(reminiscent of REM's \"Everybody Hurts\" video, except no one disappears, and this came out first). If your okay with the ultimate form of people watching, being both disembodied and an intimate psychic voyeur, this is great. If you want to see something where a lot of stuff happens, watch the Happening, it's okay too. What does happen is few and far between, the angels talk a little, their conversations are like poems, they stand next to or press their hands against miserable people making them brighten and become less narrow for a moment(it doesn't always work), and become enamored with mortals. One angel makes repeat visits to a small circus to watch an acrobat, who may have to quit working at the circus soon and go back to being a waitress til same time next year. She loves being on high and is afraid of falling in a number of ways, her thoughts have a quality similar to the way the angels speak to one another. The Angel is afraid/excited with the idea of descending to the world as well, his fascination with her makes sense. If this is beginning to sound familiar its because this was remade in the 90's with Nicolas Cage as \"City Of Angels\", but is otherwise a completely different movie, and besides this one has performances from Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, and that one has Meg Ryan. As for why there are so many musical performances, well the last song, he plays is called \"From Her To Eternity' I had never heard it before, but the chorus was loud enough for me to hear that phrase, again and again. I got the message, ya know the expression, music is the language of the soul. The structure is basically linear though, we follow the angel around, his thoughts are the thoughts of whoever he crosses, there is a subplot involving Peter Falk, playing Peter Falk as an actor in Berlin shooting a film, strangers call him Columbo, he thinks about Colombo's lack of wearing a hat, maybe he shouldn't wear one in this new movie too. He seems aware of the angels presence, as we are made aware he is an actor in a movie. He tells a boy his book about their being two Hitlers is absurd, when the boy tells him his detective movie is silly to, he responds \"yeah but people will bend over backwards for a detective story\". Some fantasies, however silly, we want. This movie is one of them. The themes of the beauty the most trivial moments of life, is cleverly and clearly displayed. But to me this made just as much sense as a movie about loneliness, and being an observer, a person always on the outside of things looking in, and deciding to take a dive into the imperfect world of other people, as it did anything else. There's a children's book called the Shy Creatures, about a little who never speaks in class, tells her teacher she wants to be a doctor, to big foot, loch ness and other imaginary beasts(should they stub their toes, or catch colds), who are not really monsters at all, just incredibly shy like her, which is why they always keep out of view, and in the shadows. The Sky Over Berlin, is basically that story for adults. The Sky Over Berlin is a beautiful, funny, original, and adventurous movie, thats fascinating to think about, and a joy to watch. Warm, fuzzy, and meditative.",

I mean when I eat a movie, I like to challenge it but when it happens the other way around; Well, I don't want to do anything except letting the movie engulf me gradually till it absorbs me entirely. At that point, when the magic starts to flow inside my vein, I feel nothing but gratitude for watching it. It feels so good. \"Wings of desire\" is one of those rare movies which had me long after I was done watching & it still continues. In one word, it is just magical. This movie speaks a language of compassion, a language of everlasting companionship. At end of the day, we all like to be found which is an integral part of human nature. It has lots of significant post-effects on us. Because of this, we all are destined to fall for each other, hitting on each other\u0085\u0085 to what end? Perhaps eternal bonding, companionship. We all need someone as an emotional outcome, a medium. Though it sounds bit cruel but in a way, this holds the society together. Now imagine if one movie could make you believe that there are plenty of angels floating around us all the time just to commiserate with us, wouldn't it be just wonderful!?, hell yeah.In Wim Winder's '87 movie, \"wings of desire\", it does make you believe that way. It's a story focused mainly on two angels, \"Damiel\" & \"Marion\" out of millions who were there in Berlin after the downfall of the Third Reich. There were trying to find hope out of a catastrophe. Their jobs were basically pretty simple, just listened to us. But we, human race were unable see them. We only could feel them as some sort of soothing presence. But they were right here, just to share every moment with us. Sometimes they were there to give us hope as well but they didn't physically interfere. There were more like spectators of this earth-stage of human drama. They laughed with us, cried with us but didn't not get involved personally or rather emotionally until \"Damiel\" {aka Bruno Ganz}, one of two angels started to envy our mortality & fell in love with a human girl. He found us so intimidating that he bet his immortality just to become a normal human being & later, almighty approved that.This movie has an indescribable epic sense of beauty within. At least I look at it that way. The substance is so magical & the way it is been depicted into screen deserves only one word, hats-off.Director used black & white very efficiently. It dominates almost the whole movie. To show the infinite waiting of the angels, he uses it & it's a story told from their perspective too, not us. So, it's quite natural that it's in black & white mostly. But sometimes, like after a relentless raining, how a glimpse of sun light speaks of beauty, hope, the color comes into play & makes the entire journey even more beautiful & lyrical. Yeah, so to speak; I like to describe \"wings of desire\" as a journey or rather combination of journeys. This movie is about the journey of \"Damiel\" who finally finds peace on himself & the true meaning of living. its also about the other angel, \"Marion\" who can not afford to put his desire in first place in front of his reality but most of all it becomes our journey to realize that we are never alone in this beautiful world, we can't feel abandoned no matter how worse the situation turns into. This movie gives a ray of hope to each of us that however thick the darkness seems to be, \"it's never too late to get back\" & by doing it so, we have got friends who are always here.",

This entire film seems to exist as an attempt to capture those fleeting moments of happiness and clarity we achieve in our lives, those moments when we feel in tune with the world, when we feel like we're floating in time, when we revert back to the days of our childhood and see everything for the first time.The topic of this film is not the only reason to watch it, of course. The acting is suburb and the CINEMATOGRAPHY is absolutely stunning. The way this film has been shot is quite unique and the way the vision of the angels has been captured, with the camera seeming to float about with its own wings, is miraculous.

I am no stranger to long and slow-paced movies. My favorite directors include Andrej Tarkovski, Luis Bunuel, Aki Kaurismaki, to name a few.But \"Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin\" is a pure horror. As you probably learned by now, the movie is about two angels wandering the streets of Berlin and listening to people's thoughts. This is amusing for few minutes, all right, but goes on for more than 90 minutes. And the thoughts the angels are listening to are pointless, hold no message whatsoever. One of the angels falls in love with a mortal woman and wants to become a mortal himself and spend a life with her. Clearly, the main message of the movie is: spiritual love alone can not fully satisfy even an angel.In a desperate effort to add a dramatic character to this movie, director places it in Berlin; a city torn in two pieces with the wall and city which suffered great destruction and tragedy by the end of WWII. OK, the history of Berlin and Berliners is dramatic, but it should not be present in this movie, where central point is supposed to be the internal conflict in one of the angels, caused by feelings toward a mortal woman. To my mind, placing this movie in Berlin only proves that director was aware that his main story is to weak on its own. I really had to put a big effort to last through this movie. But I said to myself: \"Don't give up, wait and see what will happen when the angel finally becomes mortal and meets the love for which he gave his eternity. But even that was pathetic. He met her 8 (eight) minutes before the movie ended, and it was one of the most pathetic and naive love scenes ever filmed.The only good point in the movie are the main actress' legs. That is the reason why I give this movie two stars: one for each of her legs.Wings of desire leaves certainly a lot to be desired for.",

            "content": "Wim Wenders rose to fame in 1970's by making films that are now regarded as the greatest representatives of the new German cinema such as Alice in the Cities and In The Course of Time. After the latter he started making more international films with French and American cast. In 1977 Wenders did his international breakthrough with The American Friend starring Bruno Ganz and Dennis Hopper. After seven years he made Paris, Texas which is usually considered to be his greatest achievement. If these two films represented his international - American period - Wings of Desire meant a return to his home country Germany. Wim Wenders always has made two kind of films; films with a direct script (Paris, Texas) and also films which have no script at all in the beginning (Wings of Desire). The script builds up during the filming and this style was familiar for Wim Wenders from Im Lauf Der Zeit (1976), whose script got written during the road the characters drove.Wings of Desire meant the return to Germany for Wim Wenders and he has said that: \"The film couldn't have taken place in anywhere else but Berlin. It is the only city where one can realize what it mean to be German. The history of it is so emotionally and physically present.\" Wings of Desire is a film about Berlin and history. It deals with a common theme for Wenders; one has to come to terms with one's past to accept one's present which he already brilliantly showed in Im Lauf Der Zeit but in Wings of Desire he has taken this theme to another level.One cannot miss the connection between Frank Capra's classic It's a Wonderful Life and Wings of Desire. In Capra's film the angels have to earn their wings by lending a helping hand for desperate people; one angel saves the character of James Stewart by showing what life would be like without him. In Wings of Desire the angels are depressed from listening all the worries of desperate people and one angel, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) gets tired of earning his wings. He wants to feel the emotions of common man; pain, love, sadness and happiness.Berlin is perhaps the most important milieu of European history; its place in between of the east and the west, but for Wenders even more interesting is its place in between of past and present. The city has truly suckled the history to itself. Berlin could've easily been the gorgeous central of Europe, but unfortunately got divided by the horrible concrete wall. Wings of Desire describes Berlin of 1987, but also in the early 1940's - a film within a film side plot. It's clearly structured around certain eras and that's why it could be an antithesis for Wenders' timeless masterpiece Paris, Texas.Wings of Desire is both an essay and a romantic love story. It's a story told by an angel tired of earning its wings. It's a film about two angels Damien and Cassiel, who guard above Berlin and lend a helping hand for desperate people, lonely seniors, unemployed and angry wives. The people they help all ask the same questions, the same ontological riddles. It is no coincidence that the library seems to be an essential place for both the angels and the people in Berlin - it means once again a clue to the theme of coming to the terms with one's past. People read history books, while the angels help the loneliest ones the library means a concrete figure of history - it's a constant reminder of the history that will always be present.An elderly man teaches Damien the wonders of secular life; and instantly he falls in love with an aerialist. All the regular people are angels for Damien but they cannot see him. He has to turn into a regular human being to be in love. Usually in films the use of colored and black-and-white scenes are used to divide flashbacks from present but the chose Wim Wenders has done in Wings of Desire is astonishing, beautiful and sentimental.Wings of Desire is like a huge mural, if there is such a thing as Louvre syndrome, there could just as easily be a Wings of Desire syndrome. It's a huge painting which is a reflection of its time. It's a film made just a few years before the Wall was dismantled. It might just be the most challenging film by Wim Wenders and a film one can watch more than ten times and getting something new out of it on each view. It's an unforgettable angel tale, a deep film about loneliness and the lack of love that can actually change lives.",

            "content": "Greetings again from the darkness. Angels have been frequently cast as characters in movies such as Heaven Can Wait, It's a Wonderful Life, Angels in the Outfield and the American remake of this one ... City of Angels with Nic Cage. Director Wim Wenders (Paris, Texas 1984) has always taken a poetic approach with filmmaking, even with his documentaries such as Pina (2011). His slow, thought-provoking approach is not to everyone's liking, but he has real talent for inspiring us to question ourselves, question others, and question life.Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) are two long-term angels who drift through WWII Berlin observing and listening to the internal thoughts and meandering of citizens ... the wishes, the hopes, the happiness, the tragic, the loneliness ... all emotions experienced in a typical day. The angels try to ease pain by offering a soothing hand on the shoulder, but they can have no direct impact and aren't always successful. Damiel finds himself drawn to a Marion (Solveig Dommartin), a circus trapeze artist whose line \"Most of the time I'm too aware to be sad\" could easily have been the words of the angels.There is an over-lapping subplot with Peter Falk playing himself as an actor in a German film. His character provides an instant infusion of interest and mystique, which the story later resolves. As Damiel gets closer to making the no-going-back decision to become human and bond with Marion, we see more of the fleeting moments that make up our lives. The angels see all, but can do very little. It's this existence that makes Damiel's decision understandable.Famed cinematographer Henri Alekam's floating camera and dramatic contrast of black & white (angels view) and color (human view), add to the meditative effects of the film. There is a healthy dose of philosophy, metaphysics and spiritual questioning that goes on, including the three specifics asked by the film: Why am I me and not you? Why and I here and not there? When did time begin and where does space end? If such thoughtfulness is inspiring to you, then this Wim Wenders and Peter Handke (German playwright) script should keep you drifting with your thoughts for quite some time.",

            "content": "Make nothing happen... and viewers will look at your film like in a mirror ... the more boring and insignificant, the more meaningful it will be ... it will show your true independence, your courageous stance toward cinematic conventions. No you won't undergo the tyranny of plot, the dictatorship of having to \"tell a story\", the screen says its truth and they'll be there to experience it, and to drop some positive labels such as: a true-to-life story, a character study, like-looking-in-a-mirror, slap-in-a-face with a haunting atmosphere carried by monochrome photography.Nothing happens? You didn't get it? Never mind, some stuff is just beyond rational thinking and this is why Art Movies are for, conveying the kind of messages that demand many viewings to be fully gotten, and since you target a niche market, you'll find followers. The point is to explore abstraction and metaphysics , psychological and spiritual subjects, whose introspective content will justify the use of a dream-like atmosphere and a poetic screen writing, there is no answer to life, why should this film have one.I won't go as far as saying that \"Wings of Desire\" is arty indie for dummies but seriously, I've tried. I really wanted to plug my mind into that profound and stylish contemplation of human existence or the sheer loneliness of the human soul, inspiring at the end all these smart-sounding fancy words that make you sound like you've grasped a parcel of the director's light ... but I couldn't.I won't drop any director's names to tell you that I can handle intellectual movies, allow me just to say one thing about Ingmar Bergman, he's made movies that are as enigmatic and hypnotically bizarre-yet-intellectually-deep as WimWenders but one of his most notable trademarks is that his movies rarely lasted more than eighty or ninety minutes.Roger Ebert said that a good movie is never too long and a bad one never too short, I won't call \"Wings of Desire\" a bad movie but its languorous pacing and the time it takes to get to the point is so slow that even if you want to stay glued to the screen, you can't. The first act struck me as the kind of sequences you'd watch when embedded in the hospital, in fact, it's the kind of movie you'd watch at an old age or at the verge of death, staring at the screen while being carried away by your own \"vague \u00e0 l'\u00e2me\" as they say in French.The film has Bruno Ganz, Peter Falk and the same cinematographer who worked in Cocteau's \"Beauty and the Beast\" but it also has a melancholic and moody take on life and you must probably be in the proper mood to 'enjoy' it, I tried seven years ago and I could barely finish it, I tried twice again, I just gave up. Maybe I'm not as much into this kind of film; maybe I've watched too many films to ever take seriously one that features so much existential voice-over and monochrome photography. The film tries too much to be that intellectual knockout, I tried to have some glimpses on the Bonus Features but even Wenders' interview bored the hell out of me.Then I tried to get some insights from master Yoda himself, the great Roger Ebert and I found this little pearl where he's commenting on the acting of SolveigDommarten, the deceased actress who played the trapeze artist. His comment reminded me of my instant dislike of Aurore Cl\u00e9ment's performance in WimWenders' previous success \"Paris, Texas\", I found her so bad she was almost distracting, now here's a similar observation from Roger Ebert, albeit in more flattering terms: \"That may make it a \"bad\" scene in terms of the movie's narrow purposes, but does it have a life of its own? Yes, for the same reasons it's flawed. Movies are moments of time, and that is a moment I am happy to have.\"I think that's the worst symptom of \"great\" movies, genuine flaws are perceived as 'moments of time', of 'genuineness', we're talking of the stuff that potentially ruin careers and I don't see why it should be minimized because it's a great director, when it's a bad one, we find the flaws, when it's a good one, we find the excuses.And we do look for excuses because typically, these movies say less about the directors than the detractors, I'm quite aware that this film has an existential value, but I think I just walked off symbolically from the theater and embraced my own desire to fly over these contemplative issues. I'll try again, in seven years...",

Result was more than a brilliant work of Art, very unique and highly poetic modern masterpiece \u0096 Wings of Desire (original title is Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin).It is following two angels \u0096Damiel (brilliantly played by Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) wandering through the streets of modern day Berlin and helping its citizens. One day Damiel, aware of his detachment from the material world and in love with a mortal girl, decides to sacrifice his immortality.This film is a testimony to the little things we (humans) take for granted like a touch of a close friend or having a cup of coffee in a cold day. It explores various forms of divisions (isolation, alienation) in a modern society (Heaven-Earth, Man-Woman, East Germany-West Germany; Berlin Wall was still on in 1987).Beauty of Wenders' visual poetry is beyond explanation. Very few films have this possibility to take the viewer into hypnosis thanks to the skillful mixture of striking cinematography, evocative sounds and deliberate pace. This film is capable to produce the unique felling you won't soon forget. It has my vote for the best cinematography ever in motion pictures (by then 78-year-old Henri Alekan!)Overall, Wings of Desire is a movie like no other \u0096 lyrical, haunting, poetic. It's a beautiful and moving journey into the spiritual, emotional and political dualism. Most important of all, it reminds us how valuable is to be a human.Remade in USA in 1998 as City of Angels.

Whether you understand German or not, it's about the most intelligent dialogue you're ever going to hear outside of a Shakespeare play.The concepts are weighty. Much more so than the newer version, this one stresses the infinite duration of time that the angels have been putting in on earth, how they wandered through before there were humans, when the earth was in previous geological eras. When they reminisce about what Berlin was like in the old days, they're talking about before the Ice Age.This makes the decision to become human seem far weightier ... because it focuses the viewer in on the concept of eternity.Peter Falk, so completely human and approachable, such an everyday man, is perfect as himself. He brings the right tone of humanity into contrast with the angels' aloofness to passion and emotions and feelings and senses. (I liked Dennis Franz in the remake, as well, but Falk is just magical in this setting)Get yourself in the right mood, with no distractions, and prepare to think about the great questions and the nature of humanity.

Does it work? Well, Wim Wenders probably spent too much time reading Thomas Mann or Sartre while taking in some Wagner because none of the philosophical meanderings makes much sense even to an elitist intellectual, but I digress.Bruno Ganz is a tall angel that wanders unseen amidst the citizens of Berlin. It's the eve of the Velvet Revolution. The wall is still there, almost in every scene with its Jasper Johns-like-graffiti. The citizens think aloud sad sophistry's on the disappointment that life presents. Not one says anything remotely Christian as though the main religion of Europe never existed; rather, Existentialism just seeps through their pores as they contemplate the destruction of Berlin during Allied bombing raids \u0096 these shown in old newsreels.Then Peter Folk or Colombo (hard to say which) shows up to be in a concentration camp movie with Nazi uniforms and Jewish prisoners. The angel is a movie fan. Does Falk add to the film in any way?

For example, the trapeze scene that lasts forever (ok, it was a bit interesting because she looked like she was going to fall), and while Nic Cave may be cool, it's really boring to listen to an entire song when you're not a big fan.  I was too worn out by the end of the movie to be overly effected by it.  I know, this is such a simplistic uneducated review :-)Don't get me wrong here.  This movie is definitely better than the majority on the silver screen today and I do give it higher marks than \"City of Angels\".  Even though I hardly disliked CoA.  If you haven't seen it, don't try actually comparing the two movies.  They are totally different movies. CoA is obviously not trying to make an \"easy to understand simplified american\" version of Wings of Desire.

Damiel, and fellow angel Cassiel (Otto Sander), circulate unseen through the city, vicariously experiencing life in order to, as Cassiel says, \"assemble, testify, preserve\". Paradoxically, one of the overwhelming feelings they encounter as they move through the teeming city is loneliness and isolation. Much of the film is a stark black and white study of 1980's Berlin, a city divided by the Wall, and there are numerous scenes around the derelict Potsdamer Platz as Cassiel walks alongside of elderly poet Homer (Curt Bois) who is searching for the vibrant city that he remembers. While experiencing the joy of children at a small circus, Damiel finds himself drawn to Marion (Solveig Dommartin), a desperately lonely trapeze artist, and ultimately has to decide whether to renounce his immortality in order to be with her. The leisurely paced film is surreal and mesmerising at times, with beautiful scenes at the circus (Solveig Dommartin's aerialist scenes are excellent), around the Potsdamer Platz, and in the Hans Scharoun's Berlin State Library, where the angels congregate to listen to the thoughts of the patrons. A strikingly original work of art, \"Wings of Desire\" is one of the great German films to come out of the cold-war era. \"City of Angels\", a much less acclaimed American adaptation with Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan was released in 1998.",

We, I assume, should be moved by this scene, and instead we are given the classic bane of foreign films--enormous, screen-filling talking heads spouting non sequitur nonsense.  This shortcoming aside, the film is nothing short of magical. Lovingly shot in black and white, the tone of this film is one of truly inspiring love and sympathy for humanity in all of its beautiful sadness, futility, and quirkiness.  A story I read once recounted part of an interview with R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe, who, after seeing this film in the theater with some friends, rushed out of the theater afterward to dance in the rain with them.  I tend to believe this story, because \"Wings of Desire\" has filled my heart with that kind of joy every time I have watched it, and I'm not done yet.  Peter Falk as himself radiates such charm that his performance in this film is irresistible and unforgettable.  Do watch this movie the next time you're feeling isolated, angry, or cynical, and every time thereafter--it's the perfect antidote.  Also keep an eye out for the performance near the end by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds--great!  What more could you ask for?",

The ethereal existence of an angel is nothing compared to real life which consists of reading the newspapers, caressing a woman's neck, eating a good meal, painting a picture or having a beer or a cup of coffee in a pub full of lowlifes.

            "content": "'When the child was a child...' the film begins, or nearly begins, I can't remember, but it's not a bad place to start, so: when I was a kid of around 19, I saw this movie and thought, 'Naturally, very important, real art, how could you ever say anything against it? I am surely immensely edified etc.' And also, less consciously, 'I absolutely never need to see this movie again.'As a fully fledged adult who actually has just seen it again, I look back and wonder why I couldn't just condense all that into 'boring, overblown, pretentious.' Because I hadn't seen enough that was really good, I guess. It's odd since some of that better stuff would have been by Wenders: Kings of the Road, Alice in the Cities, and, to an only slightly lesser extent, Paris, Texas. It's a bit like thinking Nick Cave is good because you've never heard his earlier, much better band, The Birthday Party.The bands here are, in fact, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds and Birthday Party alumnus Rowland S. Howard's subsequent outfit, Crime and the City Solution. Cave, in particular, at this point, had attained a level of humourless self-importance entirely appropriate to the film. However, it's really the beginning of the grandiose tendencies that eventually saw Wenders enmeshed with the much less down and dirty Bono and U2.The aim is to let us know, in sweepingly epic terms, that human life just...matters - so much so that the really smart and feeling angels will trade their immortality to have a bit of it. Sure, there's pain, loss, longing and even, ahem, boredom, but in the end, when you scan the whole rich tapestry, it's all just so goddamned beautiful - especially when you, you know, take some time to appreciate the little things.Too much appreciating the little things may be precisely how you make something as trite and tedious as this film, with its overlong wanderings in the Berlin everyday and its angels yearning after ordinary human experience. I am not saying anything against meditation, mindfulness, good photography, lengthened attention spans or heightened awareness in general, I'm talking about getting hung up on trivia. These things you're appreciating may be simple and small, but they're still just material things. If you want more by way of significance than enjoying your coffee and noticing minute, supposedly marvellous random oddments, well...you probably have a point - especially, one might suggest, in a city recently marked by the trauma of an apocalyptic war and now, at the time when the film was made, the embodied metaphor of the geopolitical schism traumatically dividing the world.At any rate, it's not even a consistent message. Marion, one of the central figures, is a trapeze artist so fogged by gloom she's apt to fall off her swing and her life in sheer resignation at any moment. She is not taking any pleasure in things little or big and seems to have no other internal resources either. Well, not to worry, an angel has fallen in love with her and met her in a dream, and is giving up his wings to come rescue her from her existential black hole. When he finally finds her and is about to kiss her, she holds him off in order to deliver a poetic homily about commitment - that is, to this individual with whom she's barely exchanged a word - so long, over-elaborate and dull I almost worried for her that she was blowing the relationship. It's a paradigm example of the writers - Wenders and/or his long-term collaborator Peter Handke - letting themselves too far off the verbal leash while saying nothing much. And in general, the whole business is very teenage and not in a good way, a fantasy of the depressed person being saved by love - without dealing with or even explaining any of her issues - that, for all the floridly portentous blah blah, is actually phonier and more simplistic than many romantic fantasies purveyed by Hollywood.Why the six stars and not the one or two all this would suggest? Because of gorgeous execution: beautiful camerawork and great actors giving strong performances. I really didn't mind watching to the end and it's only the next day that the irritation's come on strong enough to incur this review.But If I had to divvy it up, at least two of those stars might simply be for the kids' circus scene, which is a joy.",

We exist as humans on one level, but whether we're aware of metaphysics or not, there is a world we cannot see, or as this film posits, we choose not to see. The story is about angels hovering around Berlin, only visible by children, who meet to talk about the unique things they've seen that day, or to meet with other angels (in the beautiful Berlin library) where they can tune into the Divine Broadcast System. Two angels take center stage, one who decides to \"take the plunge\" and become human, in order to find what true love is in the eyes of a beautiful trapeze artist. The first half is him making a decision, and is filmed in black and white; the second half shows the aftermath of his fall to earth, and is filmed in colour. When I first saw this, I thought the film's fatal flaw was its anti-climactic conclusion. Now I realise that it may be the best part of my favourite film of all time.",

It seems he needs a great team around himself to succeed, and especially a great writer. Outside this one, with writings from Peter Handke, \"Paris, Texas\" also comes to mind, with a text by Sam Shepard and music by Ry Cooder. In this case, fabulous symphonic and choir music alternating with tunes from Nick Cave. The photography in both cases by Robby Mueller. Another one you could mention is \"The American Friend\", created with several great directors.\nYou just wonder why Wenders isn't doing the same thing every time out.

Whilst part of the reason I wanted to see this film was for Cave and Bargeld, I was mostly moved by the cello music particularly in the library sequences. I think it's maybe hard now for new viewers to have the understanding of the Berlin Wall that was so real for us when the film was first released. Some years after I saw the film in the cinema, I bought the video, and showed it to many friends who scoffed at German cinema but were converted by watching this film in my home.

            "content": "There is a predominantly existentialist theme at the core of \"Wings of Desire\", and it definitely will appeal to those conflicted in their search for meaning in an absurd world. I went through such a period during my college years and into my Twenties. However there comes a time when one has to face reality and deal with life as it is or one succumbs to a futile existence of melancholy. Such seemed to be the case not only with the many humans observed by the Angel Damiel (Bruno Ganz), but also Damiel himself. As an angel, Damiel and his cohorts spent an eternity observing the human condition, with virtually no appreciation of the joy and freedom life offers. Honestly, this got to be tedious for me after a while, there's only so much pessimistic sentiment I allow myself before getting my mind back on track, and that doesn't take very long now. I did like however that a favorite hangout for the angels seemed to be a public library, a repository if you will of earthly knowledge, though attaining knowledge didn't seem to be necessary for those like Damiel and his close compatriot Cassiel (Otto Sander). It appeared that they were confidently aware of history and the Earthly world around them. It was reassuring that while observing, they did not presume to interfere, if even they could have done so. What was irritating to me however was how so many people who's thoughts were revealed felt that their personal situations trapped them in quiet desperation. As if they didn't have a choice, but they did, and choosing not to do something is in itself a choice. The appearance of Peter Falk in the picture, oddly enough portraying himself, was somewhat of a nice distraction from the overall tone of the picture. Admittedly typecast in his career as detective Colombo, it was humorous to see some young men in the street refer to him by that name, qualifying the idea that it couldn't be him because of the shabby trench coat. Additionally, the momentary sequences that drifted into color during the story were well placed and timely, adding an element of hope to an otherwise solemn and brooding aspect of the story. My main point I guess is that one can question existence about 'Why am I here?' without going overboard, as there comes a point when deciding takes precedence over destiny. With that realization, one can live in the now instead of agonizing over an infinity of choices.",

            "review_title": "Existential Theme",
            "content": "Filmmaker's Purpose.Wim Wenders purpose in making this film is to share and express the heart of existentialist thinking. As often widely categorized existentialism is, its foundations are predicated upon the nature of existence\u0097finding meaning in a potentially meaningless world. The existentialist discovers the authentic self through countless permutations of angst and despair while simultaneously investing in Socrates, \"life examined.\" No film is perhaps more invested with these concepts than Wings of Desire. It reflects an intentional obscurity through its character developments but more so its script. Ambiguous phrases and inner-monologues challenge the viewer to create meaningful structures and patterns in their own life. Such is the director's purpose when allowing the viewer to read the thoughts of the characters alongside the angels. These obscure thoughts are supposed to mirror that of life itself. They are often short, vague, and lack any definite description\u0097much like the thinking of most mortals. One scene that powerfully demonstrates this idea is during a subway tracking shot. As the camera sweeps by several individuals sitting anxiously on a subway train, their thoughts, as depicted on screen, reveal the inner despair that most of them are feeling. \"Why am I here?\" \"How will I have enough money to pay my pension?\" \"Why did my wife cheat on me?\" The core of all these thoughts revolve around the existentialist attitude: the search for why things are the way they are.To heighten this type of thinking, Wenders relies heavily upon symbolic imagery in order to allow viewers to extract multiple meanings. Rather than fixing a certain meaning or establishing a definite interpretation on these symbols, Wenders allows the symbols to speak for themselves. One symbol used consistently throughout the film is a library. Libraries are symbols of places of learning and knowledge. The angels spend a significant portion of their time in a library, studying alongside certain people in order to understand the human condition better. Progression hasn't stopped for them; in fact, it has become enlightening. They understand that to live life effectively, one has to embrace life in its fullest\u0097that includes both good and bad times. The realization that life must be lived forwards but can only be understood backwards causes them, in ways, to regret not having taken more advantage of the time given to them while in mortality. As they reminisce over the paradoxes and idiosyncrasies that bugged them during their mortal life, they look upon those times with fondness; wishing in ways they could experience it all over again.Another symbol used to demonstrate the heart of existentialism was an extreme close-up of an eye. Man was given eyes that he may see beyond them. In other words, those having eyes to see, as Jesus put it, are better able to understand the deeper implications behind the myriad of symbols/material objects that they are surrounded by. In the beginning of the film, the sun is shown vaguely shining behind a sea of silver clouds, when suddenly the shot cross-fades to an extreme close-up of a human eye. Quickly transitioning to the next shot is an aerial perspective of a city. The implications behind these four symbols\u0097sun, clouds, eye and aerial perspective of a city\u0097suggest several things. The light from the sun is what illuminates all forms of perception, whether empirically speaking in the exterior world, or spiritually speaking in one's understanding. The fact that the sun is shrouded with dense clouds seems to suggest that sunlight is not able to effectively penetrate human perception. Much like the existentialist, he too seems to have trouble finding spiritual light, if there is any, in a world of clouded confusion. The cross fade from the clouded sun to the human eye seems to suggest these ideas\u0097man's struggle for meaning in a potentially meaningless world. The shot then cuts to a bird's eye perspective of a city. This objective (far removed) point of view suggests the existentialist angst and isolation from real human contact. From this shot fades a closer perspective at ground level with the camera moving in through an open window of a house\u0097suggesting that the existentialist is taking the journey into the subjective/personal realm to discover human relationships and the meaning of life, or as Kierkegaard (the father of existentialism) put it, the \"sublime journey into the potential of semantics.\"",

Poetry put on screen, the wings of desire Wenders depicts are not desirable at all. Never before has a movie so dull been so fascinating and full of life.Set, and filmed, in Germany before the collapse of the Berlin wall, \"The Wings of Desire\" follows two angels on Earth, sent to observe the details and events that come with being human. Coffe with cigarettes,the wonder and mystery of death, being full of joy and harboring in the pits of depression: It's all here. Wender's use of color stock film and black/white scenes are a major part of the film's theme. It might be the most prominent theory explored in such films: to experience is more important to know. The division of East and West Germany is crucial to the film (part of what made 'City of Angels' fail in my mind), as it shows the moral of a society dying, the failures that come with being human, the need for love and compassion.The concert scene may be the best use of foreshadowing and reference to a social happenings I've ever seen. As the punk and rebellious group Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds play to a crowd of a mostly stereotypical crowd, he sings to the people who later helped tear the Berlin wall down. As an angel finds love, a people are educated in their failures. It's funny, I was so sure this movie must have been made after the fall of the wall. Perhaps Wenders is an angel himself, or just a great film-maker who knows the effects of hope, humanity, and compassion in a fragile world.",

            "content": "I have yearned to watch Wim Wenders' \"Wings of Desire\" since it made it to the top ten 'most important film of the past decade' (or two) by Premiere movie magazine. My curiosity was greeted by awe when I finally watched it.This is one of the few plotless films that I truly appreciate. Most of the film involves angels observing humanity in Berlin, and Damiel, a particularly passionate angel, is moved to the point of considering participation amongst mortals. There were film images that I do not quite comprehend, and unexplained parts in this fable, but the angel's face, and the inobtrusively voyeuristic camera angles spoke volumes.I admire this film for its metaphysical content: its a celebration of humanity through the eyes of celestial beings (Damiel and Cassiel). The main source of speech in this film is inner dialogue. The angles can hear our thoughts, and the \"dialogue\" in the film represents honest opinions. This is very interesting because instead of hearing people say what they think, the audience have the privilege of listening to unadulterated thoughts.The film is contemplative, melancholy, and moves slowly for over 2 hours. The cinematography is captivating. The camera floats through the city of Berlin, and observes events so calmly. There are many panning shots, and moving shots, and close-ups of the angel's face that truly define this film (I'm not sure how to explain this). The use of monochrome film for the point of view of the angels, and color for humans are done with such subtlety as to yield the perfect mood. I am especially awed by the sequences where B&W is switched to color; from angel to human perspectives.The film works on one tone in its length. There are no moments of high action, nor micro seconds of heavy melodrama. \"Wings Of Desire\" remains pensive, and observing all the way to the end, and it still works. I have never seen anything like this, and it captures something wonderful about human existence (the work of God?) through sight and sound, rather than a coherent storyline. In this sense, I rank it among the most unique, original films I have seen recently (like \"Blue\", and \"The Apostle\"). I am very convinced that there is a German actor named Bruno Ganz who is a part-time angel.",

And meanwhile, a famous actor (Peter Falk) ruminates about the ways of the world, of acting, of cinema (if not directly then in the subtext), and we follow him for a bit. Whether there will be direct interaction, who knows. But the angel makes a decision, and falls from the sky to try and become something else. Ultimately, the Angel is all about romance - whether he finds it directly is another question.Such is the thrust of Wim Wenders Wings of Desire, a film that many have touted as one of the greats of the 1980s. I think this is the kind of movie you either go for, or you don't. I mostly went for it, and the poet in me liked a lot of the words that came out in the voice-overs. It's a very humanistic movie and if nothing else it can be praised by that... actually, it's the visual scope that dominates and triumphs (I'd like to take this DP out for a beer).If only Wenders could back off just a little from his super-mega-sumptuous-Berlin-poetry and get back to the story a little more, it would really be something fully magical (rather, a marriage of the two). I have to recommend it strongly for its visual and usually aural beauty, and Ganz's touching performance too. But I didn't find it to be quite the masterpiece most do. I apologize on behalf of my brain not taking in all of the supposed awe-inspiring words spoken by people (almost everyone has the poetry of a master, and many of them just sound like they're reading as opposed to naturally speaking), but it's just how I took it in.Oh, and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds makes a prominent appearance in the third act.

After always being invisible to people: only capable of hearing their thoughts and comforting their souls, one of the angels longs for the touch of another human; especially after he falls for a circus trapeze artist. He longs to do the things we enjoy, smoke a cigarette or drink a cup of coffee, experience all the emotions we take for granted. The cinematography is great, the dialogue is thought-provoking yet approachable, and the acting is superb. I have not yet seen the sequel, but am very excited to see what Wenders does with the second half of the story. As a last thought, I think it is great Peter Falk (TV's Colombo) was able to do a little tongue-in-cheek acting here, I like seeing Hollywood stars who are willing to poke fun at their established images.

            "content": "Wim Wenders likes making slow movies - as \"Paris, Texas\" or the \"Soul of a Man\". (This is important to know this before seeing the movie, because nobody is all the time in the mood for this kind of cinema.)The movie tells the story of two angels, living in Berlin; they are enjoying the beauty of god's creation, noting curious and particularly beauty events in a diary. However, they are always some kind of distant, cannot be seen or touched, have no possibility to interact with humans in a physical way, only in a spiritual one, giving them some psychological support. One of them falls in love with a handsome french woman, and - by her - with time, with taste, with touch, with all which belongs to human perception. He decides to become human. This is the essential of the story; the rest lies in the fantastic pictures, in one of the best soundtracks I ever heard, and in those beautiful words. The unconnected and unfinished thoughts of the human beings form a floating and fuzzy fog, which make of this movie an unconventional and surprising one - with a bit of an experimental taste. This is also a movie about Berlin. With its people, its history, the Nazis, the bombs, the reconstruction, the wall.Mixed with some sparse \"pointillage\" of humor, Wim Wenders has achieved a Master piece with this movie ... even if I prefer the less ambitious Paris, Texas.",

            "content": "To describe today's troubling economy, one could say, as the poet Homer says in Wings of Desire: \"The world seems to be sinking into dusk, but I tell the stories as in the beginning in my sing-song voice which sustains me, protected by the tale from the troubling present.\" This is only one example of many of the cinematic poetry used in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire. Homer is very reminiscent of another \"Homer\": The author of the Iliad. All of his dialog and even his blocking from the library scene to the couch in the middle of the field is pure poetry. In fact, the film itself is bookended in poetry. The movie starts with an angel Damiel writing in his journal\" when the child was still a child\" he had questions about the world, was not picky, and was generally more cooperative. The tale is told in German in a \"sing-song\" voice, \"Als Das kind kind war...\" He sits next to his Angel friend Cassiel (played by Otto Sadler, who previously starred in the epic movie Das Boot) in a convertible with the light reflecting off the windshield in such a way that it looks like wings. Damiel and Cassiel compare notes of what they have witnessed. The angels move around unseen among the people of Berlin, reading people's thoughts and whispering comforting words to people. The people too, are not completely seen by the angels. The angels can only view the world in black and white. While privy to all that will happen in the world and to immortality, angels do not know what it is like to feel, to taste, or to be acknowledged by a stranger. Damiel tells Cassiel that while it is great to live for eternity, he sometimes gets fed up with his spiritual existence. He longs to have blackened fingers from the newspaper, to have a fever, or to be excited by a meal. Cassiel reminds him that they are there to do no more that to preserve, collect, and testify. This too is poetry. The angels like to spend much time in the library. The library is full of books of knowledge and therefore seen as a sacred place. They are seen whispering to people who are reading, perhaps trying to inspire them. The irony is that the books contain text which the angels can see. Text, like the angels, can inspire a person only if he or she is open to it. Ironically, even though human beings cannot see angels, the angels, even though they read thoughts, cannot see the pictures painted by the imagination in the minds of the humans when reading text. Damiel yearns to be human even more when he goes to the circus and falls in love with his own angel: a trapeze artist that is dressed like an angel. He tells Cassiel that he wants to be human. Cassiel, in another example of cinematic poetry, brings albeit reluctantly, Damiel through the Berlin wall where he transforms to the human state and everything turns to color. Damiel and Cassiel are as symbolic as the Berlin wall that they pass through, as they are opposites. Damiel, free like the West, full of dreams and the desire to choose. Cassiel on the other hand is like the East: Rigid, does as instructed, no free thought or desires. Meanwhile in a subplot, the angels have been following Peter Falk who has come to Germany to make a film. Falk tells Damiel, \"I can't see you, but I know that you are there.\" When Damiel turns human, he looks up Peter Falk and Falk reveals that he too used to be an angel. When Damiel asks him what to do or expect, Falk tells him that he has to figure it out and that's what makes it fun. Damiel leaves to go find his trapeze artist. After a series of near misses, Damiel and his trapeze artist end up at the same bar. Meanwhile, in another example of cinematic poetry, Cassiel closes his eyes in the bar and then the stage lights cast three different shadows off his body, alternating and shifting location and color as if the audience is watching him break into pieces. Lastly, after Damiel and the trapeze artist do you unite, they are seen together as she glides on the trapeze with artistic beauty and in another poetic motion, their shadows are seen dancing representing the visible and only partly visible, but as the shadows suggest that they are only partly visible, that is part of the fun.",

Among the people they view are a circus trapeze artist, Nick Cave, and Peter Falk, the latter two playing versions of their real life selves. It's noticeable how poor 1980s Berlin looks, still scarred by the legacy of World War Two (and with the additional scar of the Berlin wall on top of that); Wenders shoots it alternately in a sepia-toned black-and-white, and in washed-out colour. That Falk is shooting a war film within the movie adds to the austere mood. The people are lonely, but touch each other through their common humanity, something in which the angel eventually gets to share. It's a very long film, and really it shouldn't work, but it's full of nice touches. Some might hate it, others may consider it a work of genius; at the very least it's a work of an auteur at the height of his peculiar powers.",

How much more profound a juxtaposition can one get than that!?The use of Peter Falk as himself only adds to the authenticity of the events as they onfold.

It is also a rare example of a philosophical and spiritual film which wasn't made by a Christian but also isn't drowning in material that a conservative would find offensive. I can actually recommend this one to a lot of people who I normally wouldn't be able to.While the Black and White cinematography wasn't necessary for the film, the choice to use it lends itself to the ethereal quality for which the film is striving. The detachment of the angels Damiel (Bruno Ganz, \"Downfall\") and Cassiel (Otto Sander, \"Das Boot\") is especially felt as they roam Berlin observing the people and their spiritual thoughts but never more so than in the brief moments and extended sequences of color.As a cinephile, B&W cinematography is second nature and doesn't even feel odd anymore. Even if you are unaccustomed to it, I think by about 20 minutes in, a modern audience would cease to even notice it. Until it changes to color, that is. At this point, the reality of what the humans possess and the spirits do not is keenly felt. As a result, Damiel's choice of whether to stay and angel or become human feels authentic rather than just being a fact that is told to us.Cinema, in its best moments, creates an emotion or feeling within us which transcends verbal communication. This transcendence is one of the reasons that \"Wings of Desire\" goes from being a simple fantasy movie, which we are accustomed to seeing, to an exploration of humanity's nature and the value of actual experience.For our full review of \"Wings of Desire\" and hundreds of other reviews, articles, and podcast episodes visit True Myth Media!",

The second part of the film is in clear revival, where the first narrative leaps are perceived and the aspect of suffocating and sometimes exhausting refinement in the Pindaric monologues of the characters is lost (in part). Although we may probably find it more enjoyable to read this script than to follow it on screen, it certainly cannot be said that the feature film lacks punctuality or that it is inconclusive, it certainly cannot be accused of superficial content! It is without doubt one of the most profound and passionate \"concept\" films of modern cinema.

The writing is a poem; the music is a poem; the direction is a poem; and the performances are a poem.This movie is very subtle and of rare beauty. It has a dreamy atmosphere, and at the same time very dark. You can feel something wrong is happening: you can see the Berlin Wall, a lot of people contemplating life, and the black and white makes everything look like it's happening elsewhere. Wim Wenders shoots beautifully, with the camera always moving softly, making you feel the characters. A great example is the first scene in the nightclub. The voice overs are an original way of showing feelings, and, in this case, very rewarding.You have to like slow paced movies to enjoy this one. The first hour is just character development, and the angels walk through the city, helping people and thinking about life. Then, Bruno Ganz's character decides to become a man, coming into this world to live and feel, and suddenly everything gains color for him. His entrance in the world of living is a beautiful metaphor, and the dialog between him and Marion is brilliant.The performances are great, too. Bruno Ganz can express all of the emotions of the character without speaking, most of the time. The look in his eyes, his body language, and the way he delivers his few lines is amazing. Solveig Dommartin has a good delivery and body language, and her voice overs are very touching. Otto Sander is fine, too, and all the people that appear in just one scene perfectly capture their characters.This is very involving; it gets you in another world and touches you deeply. 10/10",

The image of the two of them on the ledge is quite an idea. When one of the angels (Bruno Ganz) falls in love with a trapeze artist (Solveig Dommartin), the situation seems to pick up some momentum, but the slow to non-existent pace, which can be referred to as absorbing or boring, depending on the viewer, enervates this possible angle. One positive attribute is the soundtrack. Hailed as Wender's masterpiece, this is the turning point for him from those great films he did prior.",

In my view,they're almost the opposite: an attempt to make present to ourimmediate senses the nature of real people and society.  Yes, I'mclaiming that for the most part, our mental activity is tritenessposing as profound.  Haven't you ever eavesdropped on lovers'banter, or on a job interview?  Wenders has to take us to the placewhere the ordinariness is almost crushing, before we can reallyfeel the weight of Damiel's choice.    What really makes this film stick with me, though, are twostartling scenes near the end that implant doubt in the feelingsyou're otherwise predisposed to accept.  Pay attention to Marion'swords to Damiel in the bar, keeping in mind the kind of reasons hebased his decision on.  And especially, realize the significance ofthe scene with Falk and Cassiel.

Realising that, even if time will eventually ravage them, there is so much to savour in the here and now.This also is a film to be prasied because it's not scared to allow multiple languages to be heard - just as in real life. It reminds me in many ways of the films of Andrei Tarkovsky - haunting, poetic images and words - and yet is undoubtedly much more accessible.

            "review_title": "Wings of Desire",
            "content": "German director Wim Wenders' filmography includes acclaimed and popular films like Paris, Texas (1984) and Buena Vista Social Club (1999). The accessibility of his work varies, so it is perhaps surprising to notice that one of his most widely seen films is the slow-paced 1987 romantic fantasy art piece Wings of Desire. I would have imagined some of his more eventful titles would have gained bigger audiences, but in any case, the film is well worth seeing for those with a thing for unhurried narratives.The story, originally written by Wenders and Austrian writer Peter Handke, was reportedly inspired by poetry which is easy to believe as the plot slowly unwinds. The focus is on two immortal angels called Damiel and Cassiel (Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander) whose job is to walk on Earth (or Berlin, Germany to be exact) listening to people's thoughts and often discreetly consoling them with their special powers, although they are not there solely in mankind's service. Though the angels look like ordinary men, only children and other angels can see them or sense their presence. Certain three humans catch Damiel and Cassiel's attention: an old man called Homer (Curt Bois) who likes to read and tell stories, a lonely and financially struggling trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin) and the famous actor Peter 'Columbo' Falk (playing himself) who has come to Berlin to shoot a movie about the Nazi era and turns out to have a surprising past himself.Even though the premise of two angels secretly helping out people may sound excruciatingly cheesy at first, Wings of Desire fortunately avoids naive heavy-handedness; the angels are seen as existing per se as opposed to being mere servants of gods, if any. In the end the film is largely about love and humanity: Damiel is unhappy with his eternal, omniscient existence and longs to become flesh and blood in order to taste the love of Marion whom he has been observing in his invisible angelic form. Besides the romantic plot, a lot of time is spent on listening to other people's worries and thoughts, philosophizing about the nature of human life and generally wandering around the big city.Children's way of thinking and perceiving the world around them is mentioned and admired several times (indeed, starting with the very first shot), so many of the ponderings are admittedly childlike. This is not a bad thing at all since it makes the thoughts and dialogue more easily accessible than they would otherwise be. Of course, accusations of pretension and boredom are to be expected from many viewers and I don't want to dismiss such opinions altogether, but personally I enjoy slow meditative films even if I don't always understand all the ideas behind them. Still, Wings of Desire is rather long at over two hours and I feel it could have benefited from some trimming especially in the middle parts. The final quarter is the one I think I enjoyed the best, as it is when the world of the angels finally starts gaining new shades and colours, both literally and figuratively.The distinction between the always stylish black & white cinematography (as seen through the angels' eyes) and the colours of the mortals' world is a major charm when it comes to technical aspects of the film. Besides the photography, I enjoyed the sweeping camera movements and aerial views of the streets and other locations of Berlin, such as a big library and a rock club where Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds are playing their haunting music. Marion's trapeze acts are good-looking as well; some grainy archive footage of mankind's past traumas is also utilized at points.Basically I appreciate the whole outsider's perspective the film provides into human life and consider Wings of Desire a pleasant cinematic experience, but the excessive length and the slightly overly artistic monologues keep it from resonating with me with full power. For Wenders beginners I would recommend at least Paris, Texas, The American Friend (1977) or even the Yasujir\u00f4 Ozu-themed documentary Tokyo-Ga (1985) before this one, but if the director's slow, atmospheric and philosophical style hits home with you, Wings of Desire is a must-see.",

            "content": "This is the project great makers undertake without exception from Welles to Iwai; if those things which you can't touch with the hand can be felt to exist, yearning, memory, thought, if right now you can recall an image, it means this space extends around us and is a part of us, so how can this be surrounded with the camera, acknowledged beneath the story and allowed to float as life?It's a great joy to have this, Wenders repeatedly tried. He knows Buddhism, how narratives of the mind obscure a true perception, how dust settles on mirrors. He may or not know that both Buddhists and contemporaneous Greeks early on identified liberating wisdom as the right use of appearances, the link is Alexander's travel to India. And he must know that since the Greeks divinity in the West, apprehension of god, has been implicitly woven with the mind that attempts to transcend itself.So Wenders here is at his most ambitious about this, liberation in life, about death and (literal) god we can only have imaginations anyway. One of these imaginations is used here, the notion of angels in the heavens, but this is only the tool though for floating observation of life unhindered by story, to swim into narratives of mind, then see if we can push beyond and transcend.So an angelic eye swoops down into murky life, the place is Berlin as it contemplates wounds and walls. What do we see there?Our eye floats from one life to the next, one person to another, on one level the film offers a contemporary tapestry of German anxieties. On another the device lets us see more clearly into the nature of these anxieties - as we approach characters we're flooded by that extended self lost in thought, nothing but disappointment, vexation, desire. Parents fret about their son's loud music in the next room, a young acrobat worries that her circus dream may have amounted to nothing.Internal narration. This is typical Wenders, that side of him that keeps me at bay - Chris Marker in Sans Soleil playfully unfolds ribbons of remembrance, Tarkovsky rich clouds of appearance as they calmly empty out, Wenders can be as evocative as both but chooses to plod in rumination. The monologues grate as in previous films, they're too long. But he also reaches out for more.The higher ('angelic') view that brushes with earthly despair but flies off again finds no purpose or solace and only cyclical suffering - what the Buddhists call samsara. All considered, Wenders offers a powerful rendition of mind. Mind as the view that fleets from one thought, one story, to the next. Suffering as rumination and as inability to escape narration.Good, so far. Wenders being German can only feel the burden of history pressing on him, silly zeit and sein. But then finally we have the return to things as one of the angels decides to enter time and mortality. So how does Wenders enter this shift?If we could somehow only know this ethereal life of pure spirit in eternal peace that we've always yearned for, a disembodied mind that hovers above things without ever getting tangled up with them (all our notions of an afterlife converge on this), what would we think? Touch would be a profound mystery, having a body that feels wind or heat. I can't stress enough the importance of limits, it's what energizes life, that I don't know all, that I can be surprised and curious, that I can travel from here to there and discover, that it's all in flux and changing, it's why this whole circus matters.So I can see him stressing all the important realizations. Touch, being free to tangle with things and love. Spontaneous appreciation.I find myself rooting for this German as he shucks off the worry about meaning to be able to find it in the tremendous richness of things as they come to be and vanish again, what Herzog for thirty years had to travel to the most absurd corners to witness and pilgrimage, wash logic with doing. What Tarkovsky meditated inwards in memory, Marker in bemused preoccupation with revolution (never attached like Godard), cats and Tokyo.But Wenders meets his own limits once more. Whereas all these guys could transcend, Wenders only limps. A bit of wandering but without real wonder. In place of any of the small possible encounters he could create around Berlin, he gives us a Nick Cave concert again - style. The camera tracks forth and back in a crowd - style. The two lovers finally find each other - but swap monologues again of stale profundity.More dust. Now the Buddhist achievement of The Passenger becomes apparent.",

            "content": "Der Himmel \u00dcber Berlin is a fairy tale set in the gloomy atmosphere of Berlin, the meeting point of history and modernity, East and West and separation and immigration. Filmed two years before the demolition of the wall, the movie has the quality of a documentary. Filming locations such as the Potsdam Square, which entirely altered in the last two decades together with the enormous change the city experienced after 1989, increase the movie's value as a historical impression from the sky. The plot is fantastic because the main character is an angel. However the nature of angels is not really investigated deeply and what matters about them is that angels are immortal and passive observes of the life on the earth. The children, as the most important metaphor of innocence are the only ones to see the angels among mortal humans, whose thoughts are heard by Damiel and Cassiel, the two angels accompanying each other. Nonetheless the plot's supernatural character does not intervene in the realism of the movie. Strengthened by the objectivity of angels (only such an ideal being can be truly impartial towards life) what we observe in the film is not disturbed by the problematic relationship of the observer and observed, which is even scientifically formulated by what is called the Copenhagen interpretation in quantum mechanics. The use of black-and-white scenes later to be complemented by coloured ones is a smart way of distinguishing the worldly from the heavenly. The human characters Marion and Homer have also their own angel-like qualities, which attracts Damiel and Cassiel to spend time with them, respectively. Peter Falk's ironic role as himself but also as a former angel and the subsequent decision of Damiel to switch to mortality lets the audience question what they would do if they were to choose between the life of an omnivoyant angel and the finite but real life of a human full of both joys and sorrows. Damiel has been existing since the beginning of the time and he witnessed the whole past of the Earth, the living beings and finally the entire history of humanity. So, why does he choose to become human exactly in 1987 AD? I guess this is the optimistic perspective of Wenders who considers our time as one to be desired for living, even by beings which saw everything what came before and have probably a better idea for the future prospects of humanity. However Damiel is not necessarily tempted by such cosmological questions. After all he is in love and that already makes him human. We cannot know whether he will regret his decision or even if his relationship with Marion is going to last for their entire lives. Nevertheless we are all humans and don't have to decide for anything. Death is a certain part of life and until that happens one should better enjoy each cup of coffee just like Damiel does it.",

Bruno Ganz is his usual self in it; sublime. I strongly believe that he is one of the greatest actors on the planet. I cannot begin to describe the beauty and poetic-ism of the premise of an Angel wanting to lose his wings just so he can live a normal life and know what it is like to come home and feed the cat, have his fingers turn black from the newspaper, say \"ah\" \"oh\" and \"ouch\" instead of \"yes\" and \"amen,\" to lie through one's teeth, and to love another person and have them know you actually exist.

Since then, I have seen a few other movies with Ganz in it, but this is the movie that I always associate with Ganz, in my mind.Needless to say, this is a very good movie. The theme is probably not as original as some would claim (Lord of the Rings has a similar episode in it: Immortality vs. Love. Neither is the story of a fallen angel is something truly original; Leo Tolstoy had a short story, or a novella, about a fallen angle working with a cobbler in a remote, poor village), but the execution is superb and so is the restrained acting.

            "content": "Wings of Desire, is a film that focuses on the aspect of angels and how they are among us watching and learning from us.  The film focuses on two main angels who describe what they have learned and what it would be like to cross over as a human.  They talk of this because angels are unable to experience any of the five senses except to see and this is only in black and white.  One of the angels decides to take the fall and become a human so that he will be able experience what humans do also because he has discovered feelings for a woman. Throughout the film, the angels are able to hear the thoughts of humans. A majority of the thoughts are from grownups in which none of them are happy thoughts.  They all describe how life is crappy and how they wish things would change or become better.  The film distinguishes the fact of how children and angels are completely opposite than grownups.  The main angel constantly repeats the saying `When a child was a child,' then goes off to explaining something. The angel explains how a child looks at the world in a completely different way from older individuals and how that they see things as good or not having feelings about it at all.  The audience only hears the thoughts of children a couple of times and only one of those is remotely negative.  Grouping the angels with the children is significant because of the fact that in the film the children seem as if they can see the angels where as the grownups can't.  Also the angels are to looking at the world with a different perspective and they don't have feelings or are unable to concept some things like a child would be unable to do.",

            "content": "Wings of Desire is a film that tries to make you feel like you are a part of it; trying to make you feel like you are one of the two angels in the film. What makes this movie unique is that the angels present in the movie are not your ordinary guardian angels but angels that are brought to Earth to look after human beings.  In Wim Wender's film, the angels are invisible walking through the divided city of Berlin.  Standing above the world on tall buildings, statues, or trying to comfort victims in trouble, they compare notes while they watch and listen to the people around them. The film presents a mood of meditation and loneliness as we see the patients of two angels: Damiel and Cassiel fighting to realize what it is like to only be able to see everything but not able to participate in the events.  They listen to worried parents, victims of the past, passengers on trains, and frequent walkers.  They were in Berlin back when the wall divided it; they have been there before Hitler and were able to witness World War II.This is a slow moving film, which has no plot but keeps you involved in its twisted turns and unknown facts.  Right when you think nothing will happen, the movie takes a turn and angel Damiel decides that he wants to be human. Falling in love with a trapeze artist he goes ever night to a circus where she performs in the center ring.  Damiel and the other angel Cassiel discuss how it would be to be able to feel things that humans feel, being able to get dirt on your hands and being able to peruse in life.  Children are often times able to see the angels but the adults have that loss.  The angels cannot directly affect their lives but they try to learn new things as the days go on. The colors in this movie are important.  This movie is in black and white during over half of the movie.  This is significant because to the angels, the world is a black world that they have watched everything about but know nothing.  And after love strikes and Damiel becomes human the movie appears in color. It represents the humans and the happiness of Damiel.   He finally can experience pain and joy and he has a chance to win Marion's heart.",

However, it is let down in the second half, becoming just another random movie.This German motion-picture challenges personal beliefs, but one mustn't take that too literally. This is a story of invisible and immortal angels (well played by Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander) who populate West Berlin and have two specific missions. One of them, however, gets bored with immortality and always seeing and never sensing or experiencing anything, therefore he chooses to become a mortal.The vast majority is shot in an excellent black and white save for brief moments when the world is seen through real people's eyes. In other words, the reason why they use black and white is only to represent the world as seen through the angels's eyes (and it works!). Up to that point, the movie is a visual treat, because of the beautiful scenario and the black and white that suits it combines so well. The words and messages are often poetic, which results in something like food for the soul.Once one of the angels trades eternity for life, the movie becomes colored and to be sincere it looks horrid. The problem is more than just that: the movie itself becomes lame, although even before that it already begins to get inferior. Those bits with musicians singing those crappy songs, for example, are partially responsible for this ruin.Flawed as it is, nevertheless it is unquestionably much better than that rubbish 'City of Angels' with Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan - and very different too!",

His films are overlong, with long stretches of silence and leaves the general audience cold.This is present in Wings of Desire It is contemplative esoteric and also poetic. This is Wenders emulating Fellini as well as Powell and Pressburger.Even then I could only connect with the movie because I have been to Berlin and I am seeing a city from 1987 which is totally unrecognizable due to the Berlin wall and Germany being divided.Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) are two angels above Berlin standing on top of buildings and statues.. They have been present before the city was created, even before the glaciers were still to melt.They observe people below them, sometimes walking among them. They can hear their thoughts. At times they will comfort someone who is sad or in pain by putting their hand on them.Children can sometimes see them, on rare occasions a few adults can sense their presence, even see them as the angels roam freely around Berlin.One person who feels the presence of an angel is the actor Peter Falk. He is in Berlin to shoot a movie and later makes a surprising revelation.When Damiel goes to a circus tent, he falls for trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin.) Yearning for love he takes on human form and sees life in colour. Confident that Marion and he were destined to be soul mates.Surprisingly hearing people's thought reminded me of David Cronenberg's Scanners. Another director reputed for his coldness in celluloid.Wings of Desire works better as a meditation of Berlin itself and its 20th century history up to 1987. The character of Homer best reflects this.He wanders about a divided Berlin, with its wall, checkpoints and no man's land searching for peace and Potsdamer Platz. It was then a wasteland. I thought if only Homer visited the same area 30 years later.This is Wenders best and most accessible movie. There is a subtext of the horrors of war and genocide. Peter Falk who was Jewish is making a movie set in the second world war. There are extras in concentration camp uniforms with yellow stars.The movie was co-written by Peter Handke, who later showed support for Slobodan Milosevic who had been held responsible for ethnic cleansing. Especially that of Bosnian Muslims in the breakup of Yugoslavia. In short he ignored the message of his own movie.",

Never speaks. Reads everyone else's thoughts but not like \"Ulysses.\" Reads everyone's -- not just one person -- so gets multiple streams of multiple consciousnesses. Slightly confusing. Is this how we really think? Why am I me and why not you?...The inside is the outside...Why am I trapped in this daily web?...I have always been most alone when in a toilet...Where is that Dunkel I ordered?...What is this nonsense all about and why am I thinking it?...There is no use in living for tomorrow because today is tomorrow...Occasional superimpositions of a pair of angel wings to give us a hint that Ganz is a heavenly creature in case it takes us too long to figure it out as it did me...Wo deine zanfte Flugel weilt...Yes I said yes.Peter Falk plays himself as an actor in a movie being shot in Berlin. We can hear his thoughts too when Ganz is near him. His thoughts don't tap into the metaphysical though. They run more along the lines of, \"How do I look in this hat?\" Ganz watches a rock band, follows a dying old man around, strolls through a library, watches kids at play -- all accompanied by rivulets of consciousness -- \"Oh, weh, isn't this where the Potsdamer Platz used to be?\" He watches a circus act and falls for a beautiful and supple trapeze artist. He decides to give up his angel hood and become human, and he meets the girl again while both of them are real and she takes Ganz home with her. A trapeze artist. I'll bet that was some big SURPRISE for an ex angel! Don't watch this if you lack patience.",

Although the story is ageless, it is a beautiful time document of 80's Berlin.. Great to see a Nick Cave concert in some underground venue for example. All in all I'd recommend to see this one.

            "content": "\"Wings of Desire\" is a beautiful, haunting, and poetic exploration of the aspects of human life, as seen through the eyes of two angels. Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander), who view their mortal counterparts with a sense of wonder and affection, regularly watch over them, sometimes intervening in their lives (not always successfully). Then Damiel catches sight of a lovely trapeze artist, Marion (the luminous Solveig Dommartin), and decides that he will forsake his heavenly status in order to be with her. This he will do while being fully aware of whatever consequences might be in store for him.Deliberately paced and sensitively directed by Wim Wenders, \"Wings of Desire\" is always quite effective to look at, with impressive photography (mostly in black & white) by Henri Alekan. It's obviously not for all tastes: people who prefer action over dialogue might very well be bored. But patient and discerning viewers will be impressed with this films' very humanistic tale, full of all the nuances and incidents that are part of our lives. Adding to the appeal is an endearing self-portrayal by American star Peter Falk, as he comes to Germany to film a detective-themed picture. Wistful and perceptive, Falk can detect the presence of the angels when others cannot. The story (concocted by Wenders in collaboration with Peter Handke) is a little episodic in nature, with portions of the running time dedicated to various mortals. In addition to Marion, we have a delightful elderly man, Homer (Curt Bois, who'd been in \"Casablanca\" 45 years previously), who mourns the passage of time. The lovely music is by Jurgen Knieper, which is perfect in setting the films' mood. The acting from the primary cast is simply wonderful, and Wenders is also good at selecting a bunch of interesting faces to fill out the rest of the assemblage of performers. Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds make a musical appearance.Don't miss this one; it's as good as cinema gets, foreign and otherwise.Followed by the sequel \"Faraway, So Close!\" six years later, and the American remake \"City of Angels\" in 1998.Eight out of 10.",

The German title \"Der Himmel \u00fcber Berlin\" (The Sky above Berlin) is a better fit than \"Wings of Desire\". Unfortunately some translations convey some different ideas than the original authors first intended.It's a movie about angels flying over divided Berlin (1987), almost totally shot in Black&White. As the Angels in the movie can't have a feeling of life, only an abstract perception of it, the directors have wisely taken away ours colors, so in a sense our experience is closer to theirs than otherwise it would be. There are some moments in full colors, but they don't add much to the watching of it.It all it starts out with our angels listening to people's thoughts, which can range from the most trivial -if I buy 10 tickets I can save 1 mark \u2013 to some very existential and persisting question as the \"who was I before I was me\", or \"why am I me and not him ?\".From all the angels shown, all in long coats and ponytails \u2013 men and women alike \u2013 the focus lye on two. Domiel (Bruno Ganz \u2013 Der Untergang) and Cassiel (Otto Sander). They walk, listen and observe, and it's learned they have been so doing since the earth has been earth, from the very beginning.Once they meet up inside a car in a car dealer for a rendezvous. Marion is first in sharing his \"experiences\". Here he doesn't mention Government decisions, political affairs, his concern is \"regular\" people and what they do that somewhat break expectations. One example is, IIRC, is a woman who folds an umbrella in a storm. And so their chat go on and so it is first revealed Domiel's desire to become to feel\u0085 simple stuff in life, like newspaper ink in the tip of the fingers. He wants to feel. Feel the good and the bad in life, all of it ! This will grows the more he observes. It is a movie about observing. Don't wait for a big plot. It all goes slowly for us, but lighting fast considering what the main characters are.Domiel wants to make the plunge. And a person falling has some special signification in this movie; A man falls to death. Marion copycats this suicide, though he feels nothing. Marion (Solveig Dommartin) is a trapeze artist whose charm and thoughts eventually led Domiel's to coming to life. She is flirting with falling, and if in her last circus appearance she fell ? she thinks. There is a stunt falling in the settings of movie Peter Falk, as himself in a solid display, is an observing actor at.Falk an angel himself 30 years prior is also observing. His acting only appears on a TV screen. He is an observer in life. Even though his appearance in this world is still much angel-like, he invites angels to life.It feels like a very, very pessimistic movie. The history is the history of the losses, physical and spiritual ones. An old writer desperately looks for the Potsdamer Platz, for the lost experiences. People are, more than ever, isles of isolation or \"states as the many states there are in Germany. The many lives Domiel and Cassiel observe seem pointless, hopeless or helpless. People feel the vacuity of life and its desperation, and it shows through their thinking. Cassiel remains aloof. Domiel doesn't.Domiel, after observing all this, decides to live. And that is where it gives us hope. The two ways to redeem this miserable a existence have been long been paved in the history of thought, however. The first is the idealization of childhood and animal life. Both are pure, and refer not only to an earlier and purer stage of existence in one's life, but also in human history. It somewhat follow the steps of some old schools in philosophy blaming development for the corruption of the being. Rousseau had already written about that as early as 1750 at least, in his then infamous turned classic \"Discourse on the Arts and Sciences\". Their talking over a bridge about some happening involving animals, and the circus sequence, the presentation for kids are symbolic of these two. One can live without that.The second is love. But this love is deeper and more meaningful. It is a physical and spiritual fulfillment of the self. And that is where , although not new on any account, is yet the most alluring aspect of this whole picture.You don't have to understand every dialog in the movie, every drifting \u2013 which here are part of the stream \u2013 to like it. As art and a movie first conceived without a plot, it is not like everything part makes a full puzzle. And it doesn't have to it. Maybe it is part of its worth.Life is, after all, worth living. A good lesson in these times of deep \"desillusion\".",

Seriously, sometimes I felt like like the operator was asleep during the filming or something. Did I note the gorgeous actors that vivaciously portrayed the characters in the film? Like, even my guinea-pig could have shown more emotions. And he's dead. So yeah. If you really hate someone, then buy them this movie for their birthday. Nothing worse than that.",

Wings of Desire is approximately a two hour long movie and it will have you confused up until the very end. Part of this is due to the way it was made, Peter Handke sent in two parts of the movie a week and they were in no particular order. Wim Wenders then had to go in and make filler scenes and put all the pieces of the puzzle together in order to make this film. This caused it to be very confusing and very hard to follow along with that is going on.

            "content": "Wings Of Desire (1987) :\nBrief Review -A Classic German Fantasy about human Life and the desires of being human. Even angles have desires to be human and value humanity but we humans don't really think much about it. We got this life and living it in our ways but what about others who haven't got one but desires to have one? What about immortal angles who listen and stalk humans all the time and wants to be one of them? Firstly, this script of immortal and invisible angles looked like a disaster to me and i wasn't liking the theme but somehow it started looking interesting when all the intellectual thoughts came out about human life and the insights of human mind. Wings Of Desire very much refers to it's title by the end and overall lookout of the storyline buy let me warn you it is very complex. It is complex because it doesn't have straight conversations between characters rather it is more confusing with subtitles. The entire story is told in narration and at the same time there are little chatters and murmurs included to make it looks bit distracting from one to another. However, some scenes have their seperate spaces and parallel linings loaded with brilliant and important intellectual thoughts. The runtime is not a problem at all but it is the pacing of the film which is slower than expected. Obviously art cinema doesn't run fast and do everything by rushing away, it needs time and moments to explore the real inner beauty hidden in it. Wings Of Desires provides those slow poison moments with artistic storytelling hence comes out as a pure class treatment. Bruno Ganz and Otto Sander both does a great job as angels when the entire story revolves mostly around them. Solveig Dommartin looks beautiful but had very less to do until the final scene where she has a long speech full of garnishing and high level adjectives about woman desires. Win Wenders scored high merits in filmmaking with this Classic tale and also taught us about Valuing Human Life.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",

The feelings of mixed light and darkness, despair and hope, life and death, harmony and chaos, love and hate, natural and artificial, it is really unique place with unique history. Der Himmel uber Berlin, is movie dedicated to this city, but it is not only about it. It is about us humans, and what means to be Human, and of course about love. If there is no love, you will forever live in a grey world like an Angels live in this movie. Bruno Ganz potrayed perfectly angel Damiel, i know him from Der Untergang and In order of Dissapperance, but this role is just made for him, fantastic poetic acting with total dedication and soul, like he is really an angel, also another angel Cassiel (played by Otto Sander) is perfect, also we have lovely Solveig Dommartin as Marion (may she RIP). Photography is one of the best i have ever seen on the screen, real art and masterwork by Wim Wenders, enjoyment to watch. I assume that many people (like myself), searched to watch this movie when they felt big sadness and didn't felt emotionally good. It was in my case, for days i had problems with sadness and depressive thoughts, the young woman which i know and had sympathy for her died suddenly and i was just feeling despair and sadness. Then i played this movie, i expected to be total darkness and depression and it maybe can look like that for first 15 minutes, but after that, you will feel total light. From darkness comes the light. This movie is cure for mind and the soul, you will see again all the colors around you. If you really have suicidial thoughts, play this movie, and you will be still among us, angels will come for you when it's time, do not go there before, it is grey and boring. Thank you Mr Wenders for making this magical piece.",

            "content": "When I decided to see this film, I did it for three reasons: the first is the participation of Bruno Ganz, a German actor that I appreciate and that I started to like after seeing him do excellent work in other films such as \"The Fall\"; the second is the enormous consideration in which this film has been held by a very high number of distinguished critics and specialists; the third is the fact that it's the first West German film I've seen in my life (as far as I know and that I'm aware of).The script, however, couldn't be more tasteless than it turns out to be: the film begins with the turns and wanderings of two angels through the streets and places of West Berlin, observing people's daily lives. Damiel and Cassiel, each in their own way, are interested in human beings. They cannot be seen, except for children, and for a single individual who manages to talk to them, and one of them ends up deciding to become a human being and live a mortal life, on Earth, after falling in love with a woman. Circus trapeze artist.In fact, there is no lack of television or literary material about angels who fall in love with humans or who, for other reasons, give up their angelic life and become humans. It seems that there is, among us, a desire to humanize these creatures. In the wake of all this, the film makes a series of philosophical and metaphysical considerations that will only truly interest philosophers, or theologians, or writers in general. Wim Wenders is a director who appreciates this type of ultra-intellectual cinema, made for artistic cycles and festivals, never for the general public, who find it a good substitute for sleeping pills. Personally, I don't like this type of cinema, even though I recognize its artistic merit.Bruno Ganz, on his journey, awakens to the beauty of humanity in an elegant way that borders on poetry. He sees beauty in the most trivial things, which we usually don't, not without an extreme artistic sensitivity that the common individual rarely cultivates. The actor couldn't be more competent in the work he does, and is skilfully assisted by Otto Sander, who has another angelic role. Solveig Dommartin and Peter Falk are also very good additions, with time to show value.The problem with this film is really the excessively slow and cold way in which it unfolds and gradually exposes itself. The pace of the film is so slow that it becomes boring, and I confess that I didn't pay much attention to the permanent monologues. Things improve a lot when Falk enters the scene, giving movement to a bloodless and soporific plot. The closing credits, in German expressionist style, make a direct allusion to the cinematographic past of the city, and of the country, something that Wenders may have done as a tribute, or asserting himself as a continuer of the legacy of the past (which is not as modest as the first idea). Almost the entire film is shot in black-and-white, with cinematography that is very well achieved and worthy of merit. Colors are introduced later, becoming more associated with humanity, that is, with the way we see the world we live in. Original, well thought out. The film does not have a great soundtrack, betting more on monologues and very boring dialogues. Furthermore, the film is practically a city tour of West Berlin, a metropolis that has changed radically in recent years, as we know. The wall is there, even though it was purposely built for the movie and is not the real thing.",

To attempt to put this one into words seems to me, at the moment, to be a fool's errand.Instead, I'll note that Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' appearance here is the ultimate band cameo, a perfect alchemy of music and image. That hellish club sequence, an oblivious crowd living it up as Cave wails in despondent rage at the torment of the human condition (Marion gets it. Does Damiel?), which leads into the heavenly revelation of Damiel and Marion's meeting... It's like being caught in a sudden thunderstorm on a summer night, followed almost as soon as it began by the gentle flash of heat lightning in the distance as the clouds recede, the cool rain left on your skin stirred by an eerie, soothing breeze.Alright. Well, apparently I am going to wax poetic after all--This movie conjures so many moments of finely tuned, simple cinematic genius. The way the angels provide small, crucial comforts, like a hand resting on the back, or whispered words of encouragement only heard in the deep recesses of the unconscious, deep enough that people take them for their own thoughts... The dying man's fleeting memories spilling out, Cassiel gently guiding him to dwell on those visions of beauty and love, rather than the bewilderment and terror that threatened to consume him... That moment measured against Cassiel's anguish when he can't save the suicidal man... The miraculous notion that angels are only ever seen by children, pure and strong in what is mislabeled naivet\u00e9... The relief and joy of color, once it comes... Bruno's kind eyes and soft smile, silent but full of meaning... Man! It's good, it's very good.My only reservation is that certain verbose passages are a struggle for me to get through, but look who's talking. Nevertheless, this is one of my favorites. I don't share the film's rather bleak outlook on matters of spirituality, and that's not the point. On the contrary, the deepest value of film is in its unique ability to suggest, and at its best, to actually impart the internal experience of another person's soul. Beyond that, in the rarest of cases, something inexplicable happens and a truly great film somehow manages to evoke the transcendent, the ineffable, and yes, the divine. Even if this movie doesn't quite reach those heights, it comes blessedly close. For these reasons and more, Wings of Desire is a treasure.",

I wonder though if it might have been more enjoyable if I'd known German and could listen instead of reading the subs?The angels themselves are a little creepy at times and there are homo-erotic undertones in places, but in a quite perverted way. There may have also been too many stories going on.I did wonder if it might have been a socio-political commentary on how Germany was still struggling after the war even 42 years later? In my head all I could hear was Harry Enfield's character apologising for his countries actions during the war. The inserts of old black and white footage from that time seemed to be there to shock and to remind of the heinous crimes against humanity, but they didn't always appear to be a criticism, so it was a strange juxtaposition.I didn't mind the gibberish of the angels thoughts in poetic stanzas that didn't really make sense or at least didn't give you time to find the sense in them, but I didn't see why they still had to speak in riddles when they were actually talking to each other?The way they caught what people were thinking was clever, but a tad lost amongst the rest.I also think that Peter Falk was an interesting casting choice, I'm not sure I would have thought of him as a director but he works.I can see why it rates on the BFI list, but this version of it is not really my cup of tea.300.15/1000.",

            "content": "If anything, Wings of Desire is a really interesting and engaging life affirming piece, delivered with an odd aesthetic which jumps from grounded realism to extravagant, swooping camera shots and compositions of a high-art nature. Here is a film that blurs the lines between reality and non-reality; realism and fantasy, but never comes across as a piece talking down to you, nor jumbled or misguided. Its documenting of those of a different universe that have all the power in the world in terms of telepathy and eternal life, but never feel as if they are really able to 'exist', is certainly very humbling as they ponder the prospect of what they deem proper, or real living: to have goals, a life, to feel love towards another of your 'kind', and to ultimately, have an expiry date.Wings of Desire's narrative revolves around transition. It takes time over the establishment of an order or a lifestyle, complete with rules and conventions, and the want to break away and break out of that mould in order to become something else \u2013 something you've been observing your entire existence, feel as if you understand, but have never quite had the chance to fully engage with. The setting of West Berlin, in the late 1980s, and right towards the end of The Cold War as two 'warring' sides that are The East and The West inhabit spaces right next to one another, comes rather timely and helps 'place' Wings of Desire.One might say the film looks at Berlin as a real-life city in its contemporary state. If you subscribe to this, then the angels of the piece might be supposed to represent those in The East or what those in The East of Berlin represent. The popular belief from The West might have been that those in The East, indeed Communists or Communism in general, were mysterious; that they could see and hear you but you were not able to return that favour; that, essentially, despite these characteristics which supposedly makes them superior, most of them wanted to be in the West a lot more than you might have wanted to be in the East. This echoes Damiel's scenario and his general goal. Additionally, if you saw or met one of them, you'd be a little frightened despite the fact they very much represent you by way of pure, physical appearance. The conventions might also apply to the angels of the piece; as mysterious beings that most certainly posses a position of power and long to be more like those in The West, like 'us'.In terms of narrative, the film is primarily about an angel named Damiel (Ganz) who talks, ponders and muses with Cassiel (Sander) in an array of initially rather maddening voice overs that come accompanied with swooping camera shots. They seem to long for direction, feeling and some sort of vulnerability despite being these all powerful, wing-clad beings whom are invisible to anybody over the age of about eight. They walk the streets of this city trying to do good, just as they have been for many, many years. Damiel wants to be 'normal'; he wants to fit in and he wants to have direction. His whole plight might be compared to New German Cinema as a movement, something director Wim Wenders was involved in at its beginnings, as this film movement that wanted acceptance and an identity amongst the already established. Another reason Damiel wants this mortality is that he is in love with a trapeze artist named Marion (Dommartin).Wings of Desire is full of ideas. Its notion that one such immortal being has been around for so long and seen so much good and bad; pain and suffering; joy and retribution before finally settling for the time in which he does to become a mortal gets across the real sense of fondness he has for Marion, someone he stumbles upon as she practises her circus act with the rest of her acquaintances. The film also hits upon the notion that boundaries between this world and supposed others are thiner than you think and that those random bursts of reassurance we might feel in life are the results of angels of some sort desperately attempting to instill us with positivity.Additionally, Wenders gives us, as an audience, the viewpoint of these immortals which further distills certain issues of spectatorship within the film. If Bazin wrote about cinema being a 'window' into the lives of others, the angels in Wings of Desire are some sort of visualisation of this window: an ability to watch others, often at their darkest times as some commit suicide; others find themselves involved in car crashes; and others suffer clinical depression as they miss male companionship. Despite it being rather ironic that it is a form of pain and suffering in a human that ultimately leads Damiel to jump sides, the film is a celebration of life, or why life is worth the effort. It has its characters pay meticulous appreciation to the colour scheme of the walls in some locations and has also has them honour the taste of certain things at certain other times. The manner in which Wenders only slightly uses colour in the early part of the piece makes the film feel more colourful and more joyous later on when everything is seen as it should be. As a love story and as an ambitious fairy-tale, Wings of Desire works rather well.",

            "content": "To describe today's troubling economy, one could say, as the poet Homer says in Wings of Desire: \"The world seems to be sinking into dusk, but I tell the stories as in the beginning in my sing-song voice which sustains me, protected by the tale from the troubling present.\" This is only one example of many of the cinematic poetry used in Wim Wender's Wings of Desire. Homer is very reminiscent of another \"Homer\": The author of the Iliad. All of his dialog and even his blocking from the library scene to the couch in the middle of the field is pure poetry. In fact, the film itself is bookended in poetry. The movie starts with an angel Damiel writing in his journal\" when the child was still a child\" he had questions about the world, was not picky, and was generally more cooperative. The tale is told in German in a \"sing-song\" voice, \"Als Das kind kind war...\" He sits next to his Angel friend Cassiel (played by Otto Sadler, who would later star in the epic movie Das Boot) in a convertible with the light reflecting off the windshield in such a way that it looks like wings. Damiel and Cassiel compare notes of what they have witnessed. The angels move around unseen among the people of Berlin, reading people's thoughts and whispering comforting words to people. The people too, are not completely seen by the angels. The angels can only view the world in black and white. While privy to all that will happen in the world and to immortality, angels do not know what it is like to feel, to taste, or to be acknowledged by a stranger. Damiel tells Cassiel that while it is great to live for eternity, he sometimes gets fed up with his spiritual existence. He longs to have blackened fingers from the newspaper, to have a fever, or to be excited by a meal. Cassiel reminds him that they are there to do no more that to preserve, collect, and testify. This too is poetry. The angels like to spend much time in the library. The library is full of books of knowledge and therefore seen as a sacred place. They are seen whispering to people who are reading, perhaps trying to inspire them. The irony is that the books contain text which the angels can see. Text, like the angels, can inspire a person only if he or she is open to it. Ironically, even though human beings cannot see angels, the angels, even though they read thoughts, cannot see the pictures painted by the imagination in the minds of the humans when reading text. Damiel yearns to be human even more when he goes to the circus and falls in love with his own angel: a trapeze artist that is dressed like an angel. He tells Cassiel that he wants to be human. Cassiel, in another example of cinematic poetry, brings albeit reluctantly, Damiel through the Berlin wall where he transforms to the human state and everything turns to color. Damiel and Cassiel are as symbolic as the Berlin wall that they pass through, as they are opposites. Damiel, free like the West, full of dreams and the desire to choose. Cassiel on the other hand is like the East: Rigid, does as instructed, no free thought or desires. Meanwhile in a subplot, the angels have been following Peter Falk who has come to Germany to make a film. Falk tells Damiel, \"I can't see you, but I know that you are there.\" When Damiel turns human, he looks up Peter Falk and Falk reveals that he too used to be an angel. When Damiel asks him what to do or expect, Falk tells him that he has to figure it out and that's what makes it fun. Damiel leaves to go find his trapeze artist. After a series of near misses, Damiel and his trapeze artist end up at the same bar. Meanwhile, in another example of cinematic poetry, Cassiel closes his eyes in the bar and then the stage lights cast three different shadows off his body, alternating and shifting location and color as if the audience is watching him break into pieces. Lastly, after Damiel and the trapeze artist do you unite, they are seen together as she glides on the trapeze with artistic beauty and in another poetic motion, their shadows are seen dancing representing the visible and only partly visible, but as the shadows suggest that they are only partly visible, that is part of the fun.",

            "content": "Wings of Desire, awful translation of the Germanic original Sky Over Berlin, is a magnificent movie. From the roof of the Ged\u00e4chtniskirche church in the former East Berlin, a being we suspect is an angel (by a pair of soon-to-be-missed wings) looks at the city, beautiful, stony and gloomy.The black-and-white photograph, bluish-gray, was a finding by the historical cinematographer Henri Alekan (from the classic The Beauty and the Beast of 1946) to show the views of the angels Damiel and Cassiel, who, from the earliest days of the planet, observe all but little interfere in the course of events, except, for example, some words in the ear of a suicidal, fruitless. The scenes seen by humans are colorful.The movie flows with angelic tranquility, with the two immortal beings transiting through libraries, squares and monuments. The wings of the goddess Vitoria, a statue of Victory Column, Berlin's postcard, serve as a shelter for Damiel who decides to become a human being to, among other things, be able to feed the cat or take his feet out of the shoes under the table.There are other striking characters in the film, who interact with the angels, such as the American actor Peter Falk who does not stand for: he is the eternal American detective, but, strangely, feels the presence of Damiel, interacts with him and still challenges him to rub his hands to warm them. There is also the poet Homer, a tribute to Rainer Maria Rilke, whose poetry inspired the film.Finally, the trapeze artist Marion is the female presence, unstable, depressive. There is in her a pain that can be the same pain of loneliness that Damiel carries for eternity. When he becomes human and joins the beautiful aerialist, he experiences \"the total astonishment caused by man and woman, a knowledge that no angel can attain\".When it ends, the movie promises a sequel, which would take place in 1993. For the viewer, who cannot avoid identify himself with the angels, there remain the stanzas of German playwright Peter Handke's poetry that speaks of children's questions: \"Why am I me and why not you? Why am I here and why not there? \"",

He is \"Daniel\" an angel invisible to all but his own kind (and to the innocence of children) who finds himself, with his colleague \"Cassiel\" (Otto Sander) policing the city of Berlin at the end of the second world war. Needless to say, there are no shortages of claimants on their compassion and they do what they can to help assuage the difficulties faced by the desperate and the struggling. When he alights on circus trapeze artiste \"Marion\" (Solveig Dommartin) though, \"Daniel\" starts to have doubts. His entire raison d'\u00eatre starts to become compromised as he realises that there are benefits to being mortal, and human, and that being in love is probably the greatest of these. Up until this moment, his life has been intangible and he determines that must change. It's risky though... There are no guarantees! It's a bit of a slow burn so don't expect a great deal to happen quickly. It is, however, quite a potent tale of realising priorities and dealing with demons - some more apparent than others - told in a gradually accumulating, effective and emotionally charged manner. It is not in the least sentimental but just as the angels observe their subjects, we are invited by Wim Wenders to do the same with them - and it's surprisingly effective to watch as some of the questions and challenges facing him could easily be applied to those in the audience. The monochrome photography is also striking and well authenticates the scenario of a desolate and despairing post war environment. Perhaps serendipity takes too big an hand at the end, but... you decide.",

It creates a feeling of detached curiosity, painted bleak by overcast Berlin. Falling in love with a beautiful trapeze artist, one angel decides he must become human so as to be with her. How he does this we aren't told, but he does, and once met, apparently doesn't need to say a word, she is immediately in love with him, because he visited her dreams, or some mystical connection. The transition from angel to human, observance to experience, unfeeling to overwhelmed, is a wonderful ode to the joy of human existence, though contrary to common beliefs, a rather poor one to the afterlife! The ever flowing camera movement mimics the flight-like nature of angels, and gives the film a dreamy, poetic feel. However all the existentialism becomes quite monotonous, and one can't help but feel it should have been told in half the time. Without a plot the story meanders, and though the themes are slowly revealed, it is far slower than necessary. Being stuck in an unfeeling world for most of the film does not make for compelling viewing!I can't help but feel there are some cryptic messages behind all this, but like the angels, they are seen only by some, and I shall continue my human existence, invigorating the senses, and wondering what it's all about.",

In Greek or Nordic mythology (where Gods, Half Gods and Humans meet regularly) a Half God who want te become mortal is not unusual either. Most of the time falling in love is the reason. In films angels who wants to become human are much more rare, but in \"Der Himmel uber Berlin\" angel Damiel (Bruno Ganz) is one of them.\"Himmel uber Berlin\" is however not only about Damiel but also about the city of Berlin. In this respect it resembles movies as \"Menschen am Sonntag\" (1930) and \"Berlin, die Sinfonie der Grosstadt\" (1927, Walter Ruttmann). \"Himmel uber Berlin\" is however much more pessimistic. In the film a film is made about the Second World War and also the present in the film (the '80s) are not exactly sunny (as symbolised by the punk music of Nick Cave). Without knowing it Wim Wenders portraits Berlin just before the wall would fall.To get back to Damiel, his wish to become human is inspired in the first place by his love for a woman, but there is more. The angels are there since time immemorial. They are in the first place spectators. They can give humans a glimpse of hope, but they can not really interfere. In a scene an angel can not prefend a man from comitting suicide. After such a long time, Damiel has enough of watching, he wants te participate. He wants to drink a hot cup of coffee and wants to rub his hands together to make them warm.",

            "content": "I'll start by placing my heart on my sleeve. There are things to enjoy here, but more I see of his films, the more I become very skeptical of Mr Wenders. First of all it's toooo long. Very little of any real consequence happens in the first HOUR. That first hour should have been cut, by at least half. Too many ponderous repetitive scenes with exactly the same function to describe: the wonder of being alive, the majesty of the microscopic. Yes, it's sometimes great when a film takes it's time, I'm an admirer of many works like this, particularly the fiercely conceptual films of Andrei Tarkovsky, whom Wenders dedicates this picture to (although does not merit comparison with), but when a film lulls you into a coma at four o' clock in the afternoon through directionless pontification, that's a problem. Any illusion of profundity comes from the poetry that accompanies the beautiful photography of french master Henri Alekan. I think these elements deserve a solid ground to rest upon, and a film centered around such themes requires at least a modicum of genuine spiritual insight, the same amount say, that Tarkovsky had in his little finger. Frankly, Wenders fails to provide that here, so much of the film appears as mere whimsey. Perhaps it is worth seeing for a few choice moments (Bruno Ganz and Peter Falk are good value) and the photography alone, but what are you left with when you remove the spectacle? For me it's a simplistic, faintly immature idea about an angel falling (literally from the heavens - yak) in love with a girl and turning human, so that he can experience LIFE with her. So then they hook up at a Nick Cave gig and live happily ever after.NB: The lyrics of the Nick Cave tracks (of whom I'm also an admirer) 'The Carney' and 'From Her To Eternity' are uncomfortably 'on the nose' in this context, despite Cave and his Bad Seeds looking uber cool during their performance.I admire his readiness in finally admitting it on the recent DVD release, but it doesn't surprise me at all that Wim Wenders considered ending his film with a slapstick pie fight (he actually shot that scene) between the two (now human) angel pals. In fairness to Wenders, he states himself that he made the film very quickly, occasionally stopping to ask himself what the hell he was doing, but to me, that shows. The whole film, though not failing to occasionally dazzle, to even stimulate existential thought, or to raise a smile or two, is ultimately pure artifice. It is unfocused, unbalanced and missing a sure hand. Emperor Wenders hid his painfully slight premise behind these pictures and poems and hoped no-one would notice that he isn't wearing any clothes. Trouble is, no-one did.",

            "review_title": "Wings of Confusion",
            "content": "We all want something in this life, a burning desire for more or what we cannot have. Even someone who has everything still longs for more. Much like, in the movie \"Wings of Desire\". Therefore it came as no surprise when the main character Damiel, an angel, longs to be human, in order to be with the mortal women he falls in love with. Though this movie sounds like it has great potential, do not be conned into thinking it's something worth seeing. The story line is amusing, but overall it is two and a half hours of confusion and disappointment. The viewer would assume the overall plot would be very predictable if the story was simply an angel who falls in love with a mortal, but that is not the case in this film. The director of this film wanted it to go more in depth. In order to do that,t the movie has over ninety plus minutes of black and white commentary of the thoughts of everyday people. Through this, adds emphasis to what the angel's go through and observe, this portion of the movie is extremely dragged out. Most of the commentary is irrelevant to the plot of the movie, and it confuses the viewer as to what the story is. Even when one of the main character in the movie, the trapeze artist, appears the film continues to go off subject. This makes the viewer wonder what their main focus should be on.As for the acting in the movie, this should be rated as decent. Decent in the sense that the parts in this film are relatively easy to portray. Majority of the characters in the film, are simply standard by passer, which can be played by anyone. As for the two main angels, their parts were played well enough, but even a majority of their character is emotionless. The overall all look of the angels being dark and mysterious was chosen well in the appearance of the two men. The look for the main female actress was also matched well with the character being portrayed. She gives off a look of youth and innocence and when speaking her dialog she does well in seducing the audience with her eyes and voice. The combination of her looks and the look of Damiel, is an awkward combination. His appearance being much older and more mature than hers, makes them an awkward pair for the audience to connect to.The setting choice for the movie, works for and against it. Berlin being chosen as the city the story takes place, makes you wonder right off if the movie is based on what's going on at the time. Though that aspect adds more interest in the thoughts and emotions of the everyday people the angels observe, it only add to the confusion on what your focus should be on. If the German title for the movie \"The Skies of Heaven over Berlin\", would have been kept, the viewer would immediately think the movie had everything to do with what tragedy was taking place in Berlin at the time and would draw attention away from the actual plot of the movie.Another major point of confusion in the movie is the question of who's, what? When the Damiel transitions into a human, we find out that the English actor Peter Fauc is also a former angel himself. We know this because he can sense their presence when the angels are around him. With that information, who's to say the main female actress is not former angel herself? There is no evidence in the film that says she not, but there is evidence that says she could be. For instance when she knew she was looking for a man but did not know who, and when she spoke alone in the movie it was as if she knows someone was listening. Same way Peter Fauc did when he sensed the presence of an angel around him. Also, towards the very end of the movie she knew exactly what man to go to in the bar, and her closing speech was implying she knew who he was all along and that they were going to meet? This is all evidence that supports that she could have also been a former angel herself, which leaves the viewer with even more confusion as to the characterization in the movie.The overall rating for the movie Wings of Desire would be a three out of five stars. The acting and overall story of the movie is not a complete lost cause. The main downfall for the films is its pacing and pointless scenes, which leads to much confusion and loss of interest throughout the very beginning on. The story line has great potential, therefore this movie would do great if remade the right way.",

However, one of them, tiring of this existence, fervently longs to experience life as a human being. This longing is intensified when he encounters and falls in love with a beautiful but lonely trapeze artist.Probably the main thing that will turn people off about this film is the languorous pace. A large portion of the dialogue is in voice-over as the angels eavesdrop on the thoughts of humans and the film shows very little trace of a plot until nearly three quarters of the way through. If you can hold on that long you'll probably forget the film's seemingly endless rambling but that might be a bit too much to ask.That's not to say that the early stages of the film are a waste of time, though. The stunning black and white photography of Henri Alekan, combined with Wim Wenders' continually interesting direction, create a memorable viewing experience. The actors are all solid throughout but it's tough to get involved with the characters when they're not doing much of anything.Ultimately, \"Wings of Desire\" is exceedingly well made but too ethereal for it's own good. While this was no doubt the intended effect it's guaranteed to translate into boredom for some people.

Wenders decides he wants to set a movie in Berlin that tells the story of the people of Berlin. The movie follows the existence of angels as they follow humans around and influence what they think, how they react, and sometimes what they do. The angels are able to listen in to people's thoughts through an ingenious cinematic trick where they merely lean their head against a man or woman's and the thoughts begin to flow like rain. We hear their internal pleas for help, their self-doubts, their inner monologue, anything they might be thinking at the moment. Wenders shoots the majority of the film in black and white, but when an especially touching moment occurs, the movie switches to a beautiful and vibrant full color, almost Technicolor with extremely strong emphasis on reds and yellows. His camera is in constant motion, a sort of camera entfesselte or literally unfastened camera that moves about space without hinges or blockades. This unfastened style of cinematography seems to stick with Wenders throughout his career and becomes somewhat of a trademark for his films. Overall I thought the idea of this movie and its angels and people of Berlin was excellent, but there was something unsettling in the lack of focus in this movie.

The first of these would be the innocence of children, which is brilliantly displayed by the fact that children are the only ones who can see the angels. The angels are a sign of pure good, and since the world is so full of evil they can't see this symbol of purity. But children are still innocent and pure, so they can see the angels before they get older and become corrupt by society.The second theme is the age old saying \"The grass is always greener on the other side.\" As mortal beings, most people would love to become an angel. To become an infinite, invulnerable and immortal being is a dream for a good portion of society, and they would give anything to escape from society's flaws and evil. In Damiel, we see the exact opposite in angels. They want to escape the never ending life of hovering above the world, watching as they go about their days. They would love to become mortal beings, to live their life enjoying the trivial things society mistreats.This leads to the final theme, which is the overlying message of the entire film. This message is that we take our lives for granted. When Damiel is talking to Cassiel in the convertible, he makes a monologue that details all the things he would love to do if he were a mortal. This is put into further detail by Peter Falk, a former angel who escaped his life as an angel and wants to express to them the joys of becoming a human being. We see in these two men that we take our lives for granted. There are so many trivial things that we completely ignore and act like they are just everyday things that mean nothing. But when you think of what your life would be like if you didn't have these abilities, you realize how much of your life you mistreat. In the end, Damiel is a mortal and couldn't be happier and that really puts some final closure on the message of the film. It helps us to realize how much of life we take for granted.I also want to mention the beautiful color contrast that Wenders uses in the film. The fact that angels are a sign of pure good, and in such all they can see is two extremes; pure good or pure evil. Wenders displays this by having the angels see in black and white, while the humans can see in full color. They can see the joy and happiness of an actual being on Earth, and in such Wenders has their vision in full, vibrant color. I thought that was a brilliant idea that Wenders displays flawlessly. I really adored this film.",

The use of language was also quite striking, although mostly in German; I found that the use of both French and English throughout made for an interesting mix.I know this film may not be for everyone, it's quite stark and the performances are quite downbeat, however, I did find it quite enthralling. There is a delightful twist near the end that I never would have guessed and it left me with a pretty good feeling. I can see why the critics liked it so much, it is very different to almost everything else I've seen and it certainly made for a refreshing change. As far as the narrative goes, well I need not have worried, it was a little slow, but it all tied up neatly in the end. Over all, if you're a fan of art- house cinema then this is a must-see, if not, then I'd probably give it a miss, but over all, for me\u0085 Recommended.My Score: 7.9/10IMDb Score: 8.0/10 (based on 26,206 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 79/100: (Based on 9 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 98/100 (based on 42 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 81/100 'want to see' (based on 31,328 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",

When I went to see the movie originally it was on invitation by a friend and I didn't know what to expect. It took me a while before I realized that Bruno Ganz was playing an angel which put me in a complete blur how he interacted with other people. As a photographer I noticed how the film wasn't really BW but had strange colour effects over it enhancing the mood of the different scenes.When he falls in love with the circus artist and the film changes to this exaggerated colour it's mindblowing. It adds an intensity that's unreal.Add the performance of Peter Falk (who's being recognized in the streets of Berlin all the time as Columbo) as an angel who has descended to earth to be with the woman he loves and starts coaching Bruno in his descend you're dealing with one of the most awesome films all time where reality, fiction, love and hope are playing a weird game with the spectator.Another performance worth mentioning is Nick Cave (who I really disliked up untill this movie) who plays an underground artist singing in clubs being visited by the circus artist. I think it was the first time I actually liked his performance as a singer and I've had a soft spot for him ever since.A must see for anyone who loves film.",

I would like to think I have an open mind for many films, I am also excited to see foreign films, with Let The Right One In one of my favourites along with the Fritz Lang's Metropolis.My lecturer put this film on during one of our classes, and I was feeling like \"Yeah, this might be cool, let's give it a go.\" Ten minutes it with the camera wandering around from seemingly pointless character to seemingly pointless character I felt like grabbing my bag and walking out. I didn't have the head space, which, admittedly isn't the film's fault but I found the film as it went on to be tedious and extremely hard to get through, and am genuinely surprised I didn't fall asleep.The film is a love story. There you go, I spoiled it. But the way it's told is so complex and you don't really get the fact that it's a love story until the angel is turned human to find Marion, and this doesn't happen until the, let's see, fourteenth hour of the film (okay, maybe 2/3rds).The editing is atrocious, I felt like I was watching a rough cut or work print.The concepts in the film are fantastic and universal: of course we all want to break through and fall in love with that one person who has ignited something within us, that's as universal as you can get, but the way it's told is so locked-off and so *not* universal that those who may find enjoyment in the point of the film are invited to walk out as soon as they want to.I will say this again: the film has an amazing story. It's the execution of the story that is troublesome. It meanders, and for a film that lasts just over two hours it genuinely feels like you're watching something as the entire day passes outside.I know there are people out there that love this film (otherwise Criterion wouldn't have done it for their collection, but then again they did the appalling Armageddon for their collection as well, so maybe they don't *really* know good movies), but unfortunately (or fortunately, however you look at it) I am not one of those people.",

I'm all for beautiful cinematography, and poetry, etc etc (for example, I recently enjoyed The New World, which was very similar in that it consisted mostly of beautiful scenery and poetic, inner thoughts), but it really wasn't working for me here. First off...why was every single person in Berlin so damn depressed? Honestly? ...and why would an angel have any desire to become human after listening to all those depressed (and ridiculously 'philosophic') inner-thoughts all day? It was turning out to be this quasi-intellectual, 'art' film that I've come to despise. I love art. Yeay art! ...but when it comes to film as art, the artistic vision needs to blend with something called...a story; and ideally, an interesting one...perhaps, with dialogue, or at least some rational, 'normal' people inner thoughts (the inner-thoughts of David Spritz in The Weather Man, for example). Grrr, I don't know...I'm angry by the fact that so many people find a movie like this good just because it is 'artsy'. Anybody can make a really pretty, 'intellectual' movie...just spend all your time framing nice shots, lighting the set just right, and adding giving your characters dialogue straight out of a philosophy book...nevermind the plot, or acting, or, dare I say it...entertainment value?

            "content": "Influential German director Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire is perhaps his greatest known film. It is a towering achievement that blends the aestheticism of film art with fantasy storytelling grounded in reality. The result is a unique work that delves into the primal human need for love, and finding purpose in one's existence through it. The film takes the age-old idea of forbidden (or impossible) romance between two parties and gives it a one-sided twist.In Wings, the lead character Damiel (Bruno Ganz) is an angel who perches atop the Berlin Victory Column every day, looking down at Berliners and hearing their thoughts. Many of them seem to be struggling to cope with life's multitude of problems, but there are a few who appear optimistic that their lives are getting better. One day, Damiel sees a beautiful but lonesome trapeze artiste performing and falls in love with her. He contemplates giving up his immortality to come down to Earth to be with her.Wenders' choice of using black-and-white cinematography and sparsely intercutting it with color images gives the film a visual style that is indescribably poetic. The black-and-white imagery suggests a time of the past captured through the lens of the now such that it feels like it is an elongated fleeing moment that seems to last for eternity, as if trapped in historic time that has profoundly changed the city of Berlin and its inhabitants. The color imagery, on the other hand, suggests the moment as it is passing, a breath taken in, and the smell of fresh scent lingering in the air.The contrast is meant to be jarring, unlike \"the girl in red coat\" sequence in Spielberg's predominantly black-and-white Holocaust drama Schindler's List (1993) which is more subtle in nature. The jarred effect would heighten the aesthetical senses of the viewer, leading him (or her) to ponder about what reality means, and more fundamentally, how reality shows itself. Color, as real as it could get, could symbolize a fantastical construct of someone's hopeful dreams, whereas, black-and-white images portray poetic realism that borders on the unreal.Combining with an aural soundscape that is distinctive as it is peculiar, Wings becomes like a mystical song of sorts \u2013 a song that blends the repetitive voice of someone reciting a poem, the collective \"thought-sighs\" of Berliners, the slow strings that accompany the balletic aerial shots, the psychedelic beats of a sub-culture German band, and the lazy, drifty jazzy sound that gives a dangerous trapeze act a measure of elegance in its motion.I quote from Wenders: \"My story isn't about Berlin because it's set there but because it couldn't be set anywhere else. The name of the film will be \"The Sky Over Berlin\" (a translation of the film's more evocative German title) because the sky is maybe the only thing that unites these two cities apart from their past of course. Will there be a common future? Heaven only knows.\" (Criterion DVD booklet, p. 15). And indeed heaven does know, at least in the context of Wings. Wings of Desire is very much a colorful ode to the beauty of Berlin, its people, their struggles and hopes, and above all, their desire for normalcy. The great Wenders explores the realmic transcendence of love with the delicateness of an artist toying seriously with the visuality of the medium. The result is pure visual splendor, a filmic poem for the ages, and a recommended experience to behold.SCORE: 8.5/10",

It is quite a lot of material to handle and I want to see it again. I wish I could understand German better, because I noticed the subtitles did not match with what was actually being said. For example \"Gebrauch mich\" means \"Use me\" instead of \"Need me\". I guess I have to see it with different subtitles, maybe one which is in my native tongue.It was a great surprise for me to see Bruno Ganz playing the lead character in this movie. He is a marvelous actor and was magnificent as Adolf Hitler in Der Untergang (Downfall). I have read other reviews and the comment that Peter Falk (Columbo) actually played the devil in this, didn't occur to me. I feel stupid for not noticing it myself, because Lucifer is of course a fallen angel himself.This film is no doubt a classic. City of Angels is obviously based upon this movie, although that movie is much more romantic and not as philosophic as this one and should therefore definitely not be compared with each other; they have each different objectives.I feel I have to see this classic once more again before I am going to write anything else about it.

            "content": "As it was the last major Berlin film to come out before the fall of the wall, Wim Wender's \"Wings Of Desire\", 1987, exists in a state of transition where one thing is 'on the verge' of becoming another. To a certain extent, the world of the angels can be looked at as a representation of the east, blanketed by a veil of idealistic monotony (communism). The desire of the angel, Damiel, to transcend this, comes from a longing to experience the world through a new material based physicality (capitalism). The film achieves this in a technical sense through a number of factors including the use of black and white in certain scenes, while resorting to color in others.\"Wings of Desire\" is an exceptionally beautiful looking film. Much of its artistic quality stems from the legendary cinematographer, Henrai Alekan, and the unique techniques he employed. Alekan's use of his grandmothers stocking as a filter, provides an additional, as well as thematically appropriate, barrier between the viewer and the medium. The camera-work floats from one location to the next, letting the audience view the world through the eyes of an angel, while the ambient music, composed by Jurgen Kneiper acts as a textural bridge between heaven and earth. The films aesthetics ultimately end up supporting its quest for material immediacy There are many other examples of how the film addresses westernization and consumer culture. The role of the film-star, is played by Peter Falk, who is most noted for his role as Columbo, a popular and well known American symbol. When Damiel 'falls from grace' he is quick to adapt to the capitalist system, as one of his very first acts involves him selling his armor. (the only object which connects him with his past) Even in the black and white scenes, a certain sense of materialism is achieved, as the angels are chicly clad in long black coats and scarves, with matching ponytails. It would be somewhat amusing if heaven were to actually exist in the form of a Calvin Klein commercial.",

Some of the background scenery set in Post WW2 Berlin are just perfect Berlin is a wonderfully diverse city so suits this movie well.

The place is Germany, and that we are looking at is humanity. Often forgotten fact is that the German title of the film translates in The Sky Over Berlin.Modern in the way of shooting and framing, as well as posting the shades of post military discourse. Themes of alienation, withdrawing and loss of sense. The transition of life from eighty years ago, the appearance of the first two cars in Berlin, devastating destruction that follows the subsequent development of technology and to the construction of the wall (which fall the director anticipates two years earlier).Here again we see where lies the spirituality of humanity and who are the people who have a relationship with her. Despite the existence of all these people, misfortunes and accidents occur. And the last time the echo is huge.The task of the angels who protect us is to find sense in every human being, in every touch on a subject, inhalation of cigarette smoke, feeling of cold, especially the element of love, which transmits the whole world in the life of two lovers, providing continuation of the flight on the wings of the desires of the human race.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",

So simple that Hollywood turned it into a vapid, swooning weepie.  But Wenders had something else in mind here, and so his camera follows a wealth of characters, from Peter Falk (playing himself) to an elderly historian, to a French trapeze artist across a desolate looking Berlin, reading their thoughts as they speak to themselves, clumsy and eloquent, about the small details of being alive.Of course it doesn't really jell into a narrative, but that's far beside Wenders' point here.  Certainly a caveat emptor for anyone who doesn't care for slow moving art films, but rich trove of beauty awaits those who are willing to conquer this film.  It has all of the usual Wenders problems, of course.  For all of the thinking that these people do, our insights into their emotions is quite murky.  Perhaps that is what Wenders is trying to say, but in building to a denoument that seems intended to release a highly charged emotional catharsis, this lack of clarity seems restraining.  For that reason, the finale is strangely muted and a bit contrived.Wenders directs like an impressionist composer, focusing on feeling rather than development.  It's both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness.  It keeps this film from being the classic that it occasionally seems like, but it's worth watching more than once.  7/10",

If so, I'd opt for physical immortality any day.Apparently this poetic film touched a deep emotional (or would it be spiritual) strain in many viewers. Critical reception ranged from 79 to 97/100 and Peter Handke's dialog (inspired by Rilke) was duly lauded.For myself, I appreciated the striking monochromes of then 77-year-old Henri Alekan, shot forty-one years after photographing Cocteau's classic \"La Belle et la Bette\" (1946).In the end, though, I couldn't see much point of such sleepy angelic agenda.

These angels are, of course - our own desires - our own creations which we have imagined to save us from ourselves. This is how and why Wings of Desire works - it's brilliant!We see the angel Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and hear his thoughts - but in fact we also see the cares and desires of the beautiful trapeze artist Marion (Dommartin). She is somewhat lost and does not fully realise it. Damiel has spent the ages watching the human condition. He has seen human pain, woes and cares and how humans can be lost - yet now he desires this. Marion is just one life - she cannot know the pain of others or how they are lost. She only has some impression of her own pain and loss. Eventually this is resolved in a wonderful and uplifting way.Falk has a nice little cameo. The back-set of Nazi Berlin adds an edge that will tap into the cultural memory of anyone over the age of 60.An excellent must-see film.",

            "content": "Deception Not Key in Wings of DesireFrom the opening frame to the credits, this movie was blunt in its tone not to try and mislead the audience.  Wings of Desire, directed by Wim Wender in 1987 is a romantic comedy that has a more popular remade English version entitled City of Angels.  The plot was not needed to be spelled out in order for the audience to understand Wender's concept that life's simple pleasures and the inherent beauty in everyday occurrences should not be overlooked. This was portrayed through the character Damiel played by Bruno Ganz. Damiel was an angel whom longed for life's simple pleasures that he could not have, included were the five senses with resulting emotions such as love.  By the end of the film, Damiel finally got his wish and was able to experience them all including love with the trapeze artist Marion played by Solveig Dommartin. Through the contrasting images of a black and white screen associated with the angels, clashed against the usage of color when dealing with the rest of the world the film was able to draw out the dullness that life would pertain if one was lacking.  In this scenario lacking the experiences of everyday life.  The film kept a comedic edge through Peter Falk.  The scenes with Falk were intended to keep the audience from being beset by their own ignorance in ignoring life and becoming depressed.  After all, Wings of Desire is a love film and with too much melancholy with in the self, love may be over looked or considered insignificant.  Falk did a tremendous job humoring the audience with his frightening paranormal conversations and Columbo persona.  The only aspect of the film that temporary removed it from its lofty pedestal was the concluding love seen.  I agree that it was very crucial for Marion to express her love thoroughly because quite frankly it was Damiel's first true experience.  However, by about the sixth line it was becoming blatantly obvious what her intentions were and the continuation of cheesy and meaningless lyrics were unnecessary and to drawn out to be fully enjoyed.  The succeeding lines of childhood and life were ample and heart-felt.  These put the audience into a trance of thought about self-reflection and mended the film to its original stature.Although the concept of angels may seem far fetched to some, this film had a much deeper and more abstract meaning.  Angels may or may not exist, but the truth is that there are people with physical handicaps who may never be able to experience one of the above mentioned aspects of life.  This especially hits a little bit harder home if someone in particular is in the audience's mind.  The majority of the audience including yours truly will go home and enjoy aspects such as touch and smell for nearly a week or so before it slips their mind and face-paced society overwhelms the heart once again. However, if for this time period the audience enjoys life a little more than they would have by taking the time to notice nature and enjoy the community they surround themselves with then the film has justifiably served its purpose.",

However those who enjoy action and adrenaline boosting adventure, this film is not for you. Profound thought is involved because the angles in \"Wings of Desire\" are an enigma, they are depicted as pony tailed men with long trench coats and are not perfected as a stereotypical angel. Damiel specifically comes to conclusions that being human is better than being an angel, which is puzzling. He falls in love with a woman named Marion who is a trapeze artist. He is so mesmerized by her abilities that make her vulnerable and angel like that he wants to experience love. His interests to be a human are made evident at the beginning of the film when he is seated in a car with Cassiel. He explains how he wants to feel the wind and wants to be greeted, he is tired of hovering above people and living for eternity. Problems arise because there is no plot to the movie and often confusing on how and why certain events take place. Examples can be shown when they randomly switch to long segments of the angels hearing thought with no real correlation behind it. Almost as to fill in time for the movie. It also seems odd and peculiar of the angel being a perfect match for the trapeze artist, seemingly much older and with the way he approaches her at the bar it wouldn't seem practical for them to have such a strong bond. The dialogue in the film also has an uneasy presence due to it only being the angels to interact in the beginning and the cliche lines that are filtered through. For example at the end of the film the trapeze artist seems to have a whole fabricated line explaining her \"lonely\" situation; however, in the beginning of the film dialogue was very scarce, also her expression on wanting to be loved can be seen as cliche. Since I enjoy movies that deal with thought as well as an action packed adventure I would rate this movie as a 5/10.",

            "content": "\"Wings of Desire\" from renowned German director Wim Wenders is remarkable in numerous ways: \u00a0deeply-introspective but never pretentious, touching on myriad human foibles & tragedies both personal and historical in scope. Observed from the vantage point of two inquisitive + empathic Angels commiserating (from above) with the sad lot and unrealized dreams of mere mortals.Paired with genuine sympathy the Angels are oftentimes simultaneously perplexed and intrigued by the precariously unpredictable & arbitrary fates endured by relentlessly\u00a0beleaguered inhabitants of material-Earth (ie. We hapless humans).\u00a0 A particular Angel named 'Damiel' (peerlessly portrayed by gifted Swiss actor Bruno Ganz) seems to take a special interest in we mortal beings. Damiel is no longer satisfied simply viewing human existence from\u00a0afar, he comes to desire\u00a0much more direct and tangible interactions = sharing humanity's sad plight and perhaps even hoping to experience + reveal/unravel just a few of the mysteries of 'Love' in the process?\"Wings of Desire\" is like no other film I have seen before or since as Wim Wenders along with Austrian playwright Peter Handke take us along side-by-side with the inquisitive Angels constantly observing, listening in, commiserating and commenting on the mysteries + paradoxes of death, peace, love, loneliness........ almost 'stream-of consciousness' at times, shifting from person-to-person, scene-to-scene but it somehow all makes more than a bit of sense and the myriad of rapid emotional-shifts from dark to light on to multi-gradients of gray, feel like natural progressions in the\u00a0Life of an observant angel...... or everyday mortal human being.There is much more to this film's Story which devotes time to 3 specific characters the Angels cannot help but take special-interest in:\u00a0 Trapeze Artist 'Marion' portrayed by delicately-beautiful Solveig Dommartin, who appears forlorn & bereft but possesses a mind abundant with profoundly deep\u00a0insights\u00a0and\u00a0vivid dreams .....\u00a0\u00a0'Homer' the aged (and ageless) poet who poignantly longs to write an\u00a0'Epic of Peace' that always seems far out of reach. Homer also carries the burden & eternal obligation to 'observe, record' (and internalize) humanity's relentless trials & tragedies as his Life's purpose..... Peter Falk even appears (as himself) illustrating 'extras' in his sketch-book while trying to develop a film ruminating on the Holocaust. \u00a0\u00a0 \"Wings of Desire\" is most certainly a unique and rewarding viewing experience.\u00a0 While no movie could ever completely answer the mysteries of existence....... or fully unravel the meaning of Life plus added significance of Love, I was still surprised how deeply and authentically inquisitive (and even compassionate) this film is particularly within the conversations (and monologues) expressed in the last 20 minutes or so that actually raise questions and draw quite enlightening & heartfelt insights that feel genuine and not pretentious in any way.Note:\u00a0 director Wim Wenders lensed most of this film in atmospheric B&W, with some historically-poignant scenes filmed near the Berlin Wall .....still-standing circa1986-1987 when this film was made.",

In any case, even though I had seen the movie City of Angels, it was easier for me to predict this old movie. I expected the angel to feel a little pain after becoming human, literally. He had fallen in love and became human to achieve love. Like old stories. But would it be possible to give him the pain to see if he wanted to become a human or not? However, the abstract form of the film was not in my hands to change and I was only three years old when this film was made. I liked the first shots of the movie, which read people's thoughts.

            "review_title": "The Sky Over Berlin",
            "content": "Wings of Desire, is in a way, Wim Wenders' tribute to Berlin. He attempts to create something beautiful and different out of the city, while at the same time addressing its mottled past. The film focuses on the walls that separate us all, such as age, geographic location, openness of mind and, in the case of his angels, spiritual and physical planes. At the same time, the original German name for the film translates as 'The Sky Over Berlin,' and this portrays the shared conflicts and also physical space that unite everyone in the city. In addition, I argue in this analysis that the film also deals with the outcomes of facing or denying your fears and the past. In many ways the film depicts Berlin as a very haunted place. Both people and angels are haunted by the specters of events past, and this is brought to life by Wenders' use of found footage. The angels, like the history of the city, are perceptible yet imperceptible in their omnipresence. Both carry with them a great sadness and primordial memory while at the same time delighting in the reality of human experience and life. The angels are the consciousness and the conscience of the city, bearing witness and moving around on both sides of the wall, as humans are unable to do. What Wenders considers to be the \"one perennial question\" in the film is that of 'how to live?' How to live, how to die, or in the case of the angels, whether or not to live a mortal life. In the film, the dialogue talks about the splitting of Germany into \"so many individual states,\" and in this postwar city people become as a state unto themselves: isolated yet created by the existence of so many others. Perhaps this is why Wenders calls Berlin the 'city of conjurers' and follows a female trapeze artist and a film director. Perhaps the focus on these characters symbolizes the inherent conflict of Berlin as to whether or not history should try to be examined, explained or recreated, or ignored and downplayed for the time being through the escape of spectacle and entertainment. In the remainder of this analysis, I will examine the characters of the trapeze artist and the director with examples supporting these premises. In the character of the trapeze artist, we see a large desire to feel love for others (which she voices), and also the fear that she will no longer be able to perform with the circus (a wall keeping her from her dreams). At the same time, she continues to perform and party with friends to take her mind off of this. In one scene, the circus is performing for a group of children, and there are so many things happening that it is difficult to tell whom to watch. Everyone performing looks a bit lost and each tries to direct the children's attention. The trapeze artist herself represents the precariousness of refusing to deal with inner demons, and in many scenes she looks ready to fall willingly to her demise. On the other hand, the filmmaker represents the ability to live life to the fullest and face past demons head-on. He is filming a movie about World War II, yet he chooses to focus on life's pleasures rather than sorrows. He encourages the angels to come down to earth even though he cannot explicitly see them. He encourages them to face and to leave their sorrows and uncertainties in order to celebrate in the richness of human life. He encourages the angels to take charge of their destinies instead of remaining passive bystanders to the sorrows of time. Wings of Desire focuses on what separates and unites everyone and also on the precariousness of denial or apathy in the face of tragedy.",

The end of the plot is quite disgusting \u2013 a pensioner is picking up a woman 35-years younger than him. He doesn't even have a single word to tell her - just an action.in my opinion, the lightening and camera-work are artistically done and I add a credit for that.

I may start to check his movies out more, he is a great foreign actor. He and Max von Sydow have become some of my favorite foreign actors. I understand that this movie is filled with sub-plots and branches, which usually would leave some plot holes for me and my purely-tunnel-vision-American-mind. The sub-plots only made this film easier to understand and better comprehensible. The plot; great. I would've changed a few things, most likely being the ending, but the film was still great. At first I thought this movie was legitimately from the era of black and white due to the great coloring of off-tempo sepia and the Fritz-Lang-esque camera angles. It wasn't until half way through the movie, when I researched that this movie was made in '87. The film asks every question that should be asked, and answers very few. But the answers are beautiful. Also the reoccurring little phrase throughout the movie only adds to the great narration. The beauty; is amazing due to the fact that nearly 80% or more of the dialogue, is narrated, and the emotion of the character on screen has to match the narration. This is amplified, the story telling through narration; being the fact that the narration is matched by dull and blank faces. It's beautiful. Also, I am a true sucker for movies that are 'reborn' or a movie in which the main character has a revelation to the wondrous world. And the humor only adds to the greatness, contrasting color, and change in tone of dialogue. I don't know why Nick Cage had to go and remake this.Lastly, the hardest decision, rating this movie. It isn't at all a 7/10, it is so much better than that. But I can't say it is an 8/10But; just for Bruno Ganz's happy revelation, I will just give this a-SilverRating: 8/10",

As the tormented Damiel, Bruno Ganz brings a rare depth and sensitivity to what was a difficult role. As the story progresses Damiel becomes increasingly tired of his daily sojourns and longs to become human especially after falling in love with lonely trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin). The latter part of the film is what happens when his wish is granted and he becomes a part of the human world.Among the delightful cast is an American director who is making a film on the Holocaust (Peter Falk, playing himself) and an aged poet (Curt Bois) who dreams of his memories of long ago and longs to create something permanent.This sad, quirky, delightful, and ultimately uplifting feature won Wim Wenders the best director prize at the Cannes Film Festival.",

I almost gave up watching this because I lost interest in the angel scenes due to my confusion. The film is about 2 hours long, and the angel becomes human at around the last half hour of the film, and this (to me) was the only interesting part of the film. It was fascinating to see how the angel interacts with the outside world, but not a lot of time was put into this part. I would have preferred it if there was less angel scenes and more scenes about the angel being a human walking on the land and interacting with others, including the woman he was interested in.",

A temporal misfit. The angel is a symbol for the divine we're all eager to discover, either in ourselves or in someone else. What IS divine remains a question essentially unanswered of course. But it does transcend personal believes, philosophical views or morality. Amoral objective intelligence.

            "content": "Wings of Desire, directed by Wim Wenders, is a complex film. The movie is set in West Berlin in 1987. Angels Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander) watch over the city while listening closely to the thoughts of citizens in order to provide them comfort during times of struggle. Many people find Wings of Desire to be a wonderful movie. Conversely, many other people, including myself, find it to be an extremely confusing and dull form of entertainment. Many of the scenes are too long and could very well be shortened. For example, the scene where Marion (Solveig Dommartin), a trapeze artist in the circus, performs her routine, seems to last for ages. I also think that the different scenes did not flow very well. Some scenes seemed to cut off and the end with no transition into the next. For example, the following scene after the circus scene ends does not make sense. When the circus scene is over, flashing lights appear and then fade into the picture of a lake. The choppiness between scenes could be explained by the technique that the movie was written in. The writer (Peter Handke) only sent director Wim Wenders two scenes of the movie per week. If this is the reason that the scenes do not flow very well, I think that the movie would have greatly benefited from Handke and Wenders spending more time making sure that the scene flow. Many aspects of Wings of desire are repetitive. At the beginning of the movie, the audience sees a close up shot of an eyeball. The shot then pans out and shows aerial views of West Berlin and angels standing on surfaces elevated above the city. These views are repeated many times during the film to show the perspective of the angels. The poem \"when the child was a child\" is read in a sing-song, German voice at the beginning of the movie. The poem is read again at the end of the movie. The audience hears narrations, also spoken in German, of the thoughts of many citizens throughout the movie. Despite the fact that there are subtitles in English, reading them takes away from the full effect of the movie. While reading the subtitles the viewer can miss small visual details on the screen. The repetitiveness of scenes makes also contributes to this. Another confusing aspect of Wings of Desire is the back and forth of the scenes being filmed between black and white and color. While a majority of the film is in black and white, only certain, short scenes are in color. The meaning of the switch between black and white and color is difficult to understand because it happens at random times in the course of the movie. An example of this is the scene when Damiel is watching Marion undress in her trailer while listening to her thoughts. Halfway through the scene the picture changes into color, then goes back to black and white when it is over. The meaning of the switch of colors throughout the movie is not obvious to the audience. Wings of Desire is a movie that I would not recommend. I think that it is geared towards an older and more sophisticated audience, and is not a very interesting form of entertainment for teenage and younger audiences. Wings of Desire is unlike any movie that I have watched before, and I cannot say that I want to watch another one like it anytime soon.",

I can see 'Wings' -- much shorter -- as a setting of Rilke's poetry of divine alienation, and a meditation -- for certain gloomy Germans -- of the post-war years, as nights_dream_paradox writes on the Message Board, but as an American I can only picture my younger self in a typical audience: frowning in intellectual ostentation in the Theatre 80 Saint Marks, trying to impress my date with my knowing appreciation of this dour brood-fest.(I'm guessing the poetic dialog is better in the original German; here the subtitles only mock the American lack of 'worldliness' -- I bet the original audience -- who remain mired in top-down old-world socialism -- didn't get any subtitles for the English and French spoken.)There is a blessed but brief leavening of levity (which doesn't go so far as to rise to comedy) 40 minutes in, with the entrance of -- a Hollywood actor! Peter Falk (here actor and character) is like a ray of sunshine for a few moments, even recalling 'Columbo,' before he resumes dark John Cassavetes mode: Himmel forbid he be remembered as an entertainer!Of suspense there is none: Marion's flicker of the wrist during a slow-motion trapeze procedure accompanied by a sharp intake of breath patched onto the soundtrack doesn't rise to the name.But with the American remake 'City of Angels' Hollywood bats it out of the park -- Nick Cage is perfect: outwardly dour but inwardly droll. Seth struggles mightily in deciding to 'fall' -- not so Damiel in 'Wings': he announces his intention to Cassiel during their shared pronouncements, his inner turmoil apparently later expressed by closing his eyes and tilting his head back and forth. (And please -- what's with the ponytails?)When Hollywood brings its A-game it can't be beat, with intelligence, comedy, suspense, finely honed drama, and a flair for doubling down on clich\u00e9s, making them fresh again.\"Mortal Maggie: Why do you wear the same clothes all the time? Why won't you give me your phone number? Are you married? \"Fallen Angel Seth: No. \"Maggie: Are you homeless? \"Seth: No. \"Maggie: Are you a drummer?\"Real life has intelligence (sometimes), comedy, drama, suspense -- and clich\u00e9s. And Hollywood at times makes it pretty. Take the Hollywood convert Hitchcock, widely considered one of the greatest directors. His American movies are always stylized, at times into luxurious travelogues, but with compelling dramas at their centers. And entertaining. There's nothing wrong with entertainment; it is not mutually exclusive with profundity. There are few outside of self-conscious 'intellectuals' who have anything to say against Hitch -- and many of them are on his side. Woody Allen gets it.I tried hard with 'Wings,' but these thoughts kept distracting me. I need to go watch some Werner Herzog now.",

            "review_title": "SPOILER************** BE AWARE OF A SPOILER",
            "content": "SPOILER******The film `Wings of Desire' was a film that had many different ideas in it. The lot of the story is that two angels are in the city of Berlin watching the citizens of West Berlin.  Their job consists of listening to the thoughts of these people, and watching and recording what happens. Life if you can call it that, for these angels is much different than it is for us they cannot see colors, feel wind, or anything that we can do.  They are trapped in a limbo one could say without pleasure or pain.  However, one angel decides that he needs to be part of this world and gives up everything for a woman he falls in love with. One of the major film styles used in this film was the film was in black and white.  The reason that this was done was to show the audience what these angels were truly seeing in their eyes.  This film does have color in it, but the creators wanted us to get a feel for how the lives of these angels were.  Another way in which the creators of this film had us feel the lives of these immortal beings was to make many of the scenes purely of these angels watching the people in the real world.  At times this became boring, or annoying, but I believe this was done to show us that this is all these angels do for eternity and we needed to know how boring their existence was. Next, to the different scenes were black and white mixed with color.  Most of the time the film only switched to color was when one of the two main angels was in the presence of this girl he loved so much.  The reason that I think it changed during these scenes was to show us that this angel was starting to feel things for this trapeze artist.  Most of the film the these two angels were fighting over which world was better: to live for eternity and have no sense of feeling, color, or love; or was it better to take a chance and become human and risk all of the negative aspects of being human these being: pain, sadness, hunger, fear, etc. It appears based on what these angels do is watch over people and record. However, it also appears that they give support and help people feel better when they are not feeling well.  For instance, the one angel kept making the girl feel at peace and have no worries.  This is interesting because the film takes place in a time where things are very bad in Germany.  The whole film has children in the streets without parents just keeping themselves entertained.  This film probably gave some hope to the people in Germany when it first came out.  It would make them feel that someone is watching them, and if they ever get a feeling of peace it is probably because of an angel.  Hope is a very powerful instrument, and in the world that these people where living in it seems to be very good idea to let these people feel as much hope as possible, for the circumstances of which they have to live in. This film was very long and drawn out, but I feel it was meant to be this way to prove a point.  This film inspires hope that there is someone out their watching.  A great film way better than its copy `City of Angels",

Wings of desire in my opinion is a 6/10. The movie was based in Berlin Germany during the Soviet Union era. It was about 2 angels who watched over the city unseen. One of the angels had a desire to become human and have feelings such as love, taste, and all other feelings associated with being a human. One of the main reasons I didn't really enjoy the movie was because of the corny acting. I feel as if the movie was made in the modern era (2018) it would have done much better with keeping my attention. There was also many drawn out scenes in the movie that I feel they could of shorten up or done without. Now on to the positives of the movie. I thought the movie was directed very well. Wim Wenders did a great job with putting in the symbolism into the filming of the movie. I thought this made it as interesting as it could have been with the corny acting. For example, while watching the movie Wim Wenders used black and white when it was the angel's point of view. He then used color for when the angels couldn't be seen. It was a little confusing at first but as the movie went on it became more and more clear to what he was trying to do. Overall, its definitely a movie that you should check out because of the popularity of it. Just keep in mind that you might have to deal with some corny acting.",

            "content": "The 1987 film Wings of Desire, directed by Wim Wenders, was an interesting piece of cinematography that has a way of grasping a certain type of audience. On the outside, the film seems rather strange and boring, however if someone were to be curious about the movie, and they choose to dig deeper into the hidden layers of the movie. The plot to Wings of Desire is not an easy one to follow. The movie tends to jump around a lot across many different scenes and to many different people. It is not clear who the main character really is until the later parts of the movie. The dialog in the movie is sometimes lacking, as there are parts where there is no dialog at all, but instead the viewer just watches flashing images of post-World War II Berlin. Other parts the same flashing images of the city but are accompanied by the dialog of a poem being read to the viewer, however the poem is not read in one moment, but it is cut into pieces. A big decision that remains prevalent thought the film is the choice Wenders made to have the movie be shown in primarily black and white. This choice in cinematography would seem strange to most, but it demonstrates the point of view of the angels in the film. The black and white represents how the angels figuratively and literally see the world in the film. Wings of Desire is not a movie I would watch multiple times, but I was rather okay with the one watching I had. I would recommend to at least give it a try. Watch it once to see if it catches your interest. I am rather neutral about this film, I do not hate it, but I also do not love it.",

            "review_title": "Ponderous Angels in Berlin",
            "content": "Wim Wenders Wings of Desire is a ponderous film about angels who observe the people of Berlin.  Wenders use of black and white photography in this film shows that the angels world is constricted to black and white while those that they watch live in the world of color.  The main angel in the film has grown weary of simply watching and wants to experience that which humans take for granted.  Angels have no concept of taste or feel but they do have a concept of desire which the angel is experiencing.  After nearly half the film has passed this angel finally becomes human, and the film makes a switch from black and white to color.  As stated earlier this is one of the most ponderous films I have seen.  The pace of this film is so deliberate that I do not think that it could possibly be made in the U.S.  It was remade in the United States but the end product was so far removed from the original that it really shouldn't be considered a remake.  Wenders staging of events, the camera movement and the actors performances all mirror each other in the deliberate time they all take to make their points.  The main character mentions his desire to become human but the actual change comes at a glacial pace and the viewer has to take his word for it because the desire seems so internalized.  Wenders sets everything up and lets the story unfold at a pace that many Americans would find too slow.  The only criticism I have of this film is the intermittent use of color earlier in the film before it switches to color permanently.  Wenders would have had a more dramatic impact is he had held off on using any color until the angel became human, much like the effect of watching The Wizard of Oz.",

            "content": "My rating for the wings of desire would have to be two stars out of five. This movie overall is entirely too confusing and unattractive when you first start watching the movie. The director could have fulfilled the image he saw for the movie and the message he was trying to relay to the audience more enjoyable than what he actually did. Overall, when watching the movie you feel like you have to guess at what is really going on or what is trying to be understood in the underlying message in the scene. What makes the movie unenjoyable is the transitions, the bad acting, the direction the movie went, and how boring it actually was. The transitions of the movie were very choppy and boring. When changing from scene to scene it was not smooth and eased its way, it looked as if they had a new idea and without giving us some type of cause they just jumped to that specific scene and/or person. Then when transitioning from character to character you couldn't keep up with who was who, or what was significant about that person or if anything was significant about them at all. Just that alone would deteriorate someone from finishing the movie and just bring the the movie back.When watching the movie the theme was really easy to spot out without a challenge, which made for a pretty standard and mediocre movie. As soon as I started watching I figured the movie was relaying the message that no one or nothing is too great to not desire something they want. When watching this movie it takes less than an hour to figure out the theme, which made the movie less interesting. Whenever someone watches a movie, it is better for the audience to try and figure out the theme which keeps the movie interesting. Once you lose interest in that movie it is not worth the time and effort to sit there and keep watching a movie you already figured out and that's how I felt when watching Wings of Desire.The acting in the movie was very amateur. It felt as if the actors/actresses were reading a script. The actors acting was so poor that any random person off the street could have played the character because the characters felt like regular extras in the movie who had no significance. Whenever they acted the scene it did not flow. It felt like they were forcing the emotions and did not tap into the character they were supposed to portray. When comparing them to another movies acting they looked like new comers. The actors that were chosen did not fit the script. Throughout the movie, the camera shots were poor quality for the time they were in. When comparing to another movie, the camera shots were very amateur. The close ups were at awkward times. They also got too close up on their face and should have gave them a more profile view, and the angels they chose throughout the movie were very poor choices. The lighting in the movie in some of the scenes was very poor lighting and made the characters very dark. Overall I did not like the experience that I received when watching this movie. The movie was really boring and exhausting to watch. While watching this movie, you notice the poor choices the director which made the movie a huge downfall. To me, I think the movie could have used a lot of more work before they released it to the public. This movie was something I would not recommend to someone else as a great movie.",

            "content": "I had to right the title in German! An Amazing film from start to finish!\nA friend of mine at work and I were discussing older cult movies. I recommended \"King of Hearts\" to her, and she recommended \"Wing of Desire\" to me. While KOH makes it's statements about the idiocy of war and makes you think a lot, WOD makes you think about fanciful flights of thought and what people are thinking. How hope and hopelessness intertwine and how timeless angels can sometimes want more. Just as humans want higher mountains and bigger cities, or to be lonely. The black and white sequences are awe-inspiring in their own right, but the luscious color sequences are actually more surreal with their vivid. striking tones and 50's style coloring (even though it takes place in the 80's). Suburb acting,cinematography,writing and music make this film a joy to watch. I just received my copy yesterday and have already watched it twice. If you believe in angels, watch this movie for the story of their existence. If you don't believe in angels, watch it for the human stories that unfold throughout the film. If you don't understand German or French, the English subtitles are easy to follow along with.If you haven't seen \"City of Angels\" watch this first. If you have seen it, prepare yourself for a much more intriguing voyage, The detail of the inner dialogues is far superior to the watered down chatter between the COA characters.The movie is 40 years old, but it could have been made this year. It is poignant, beautiful, and will leave many a lasting memory.P.S. Peter Faulk is fabulous in this flick. But so is everyone else. Plus, you get a concert from Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds.I could go on and on about how the music is perfectly fitted to each scene, or how the photography grabs you form the first second, or even the small bits of humor ever so skillfully woven into the dark fabric of the story. Instead, I will leave you with these words ... Watch it, then watch it again. Then watch it at least once a year to keep yourself from becoming someone who is just waiting to die.\"Tell me of the men, women, and children who will look for me - me, their storyteller, their bard, their choirmaster - because they need me more than anything in the world.\"",

            "content": "Wings of Desire is a movie that focuses on our \"guardian angels\". The two main characters Damiel (who is played by Bruno Ganz) and Marion (who is played by Otto Sander), and they are the guardian angels. In this movie, they walk around Berlin and listen for people who are having troubled thoughts. When they find someone, they go up to them and try to help them. For example, there is a young man who is contemplating jumping off a building to commit suicide. So, Marion walks up to him and hugs him to try to comfort him and change his mind. Although, the man does not change his mind and still jumps off. Even though that scene is very depressing to watch, I like the way they ended it because it shows us that angels do not always win in the end. Their lives are not always so amazing. In this movie it shows them wearing trench coats, it has them seeing the world in black and white, and it shows that they can not always help the person make the right decision. I also liked the color change that happened in this movie. I liked how throughout the whole first part of the movie the color was in black and white because it was through the angels part of view. But when he decided to change over to.a human it switched to color because that was what the humans were seeing. What I did not like about this movie was the first half did not have a plot. It jumped around from scene to scene. I did not like this because it takes a little bit to understand what the story actually is, so when it is jumping around like that the movie becomes very confusing. Overall I would rate this movie a 6/10 just because of the slow start. Although, once you figure out what is going on this movie becomes a very strong and touching movie to watch.",

I recently saw this in a cinema class and was bored out of my mind with it. Some of this movie, such as the angels listening to everyone's thought for 3/4 of the movie, could be cut out entirely. The movie doesn't really begin until it turns color! \"City of Angels\" was much much better. I'd recommend watching emergency broadcasting tests before \"Wings of Desire\". The character development was very poor and I could not attach myself to any character in the movie. What the heck was \"Columbo\" doing in this movie?? Peter Falk should be embarrassed he's name is associated with \"Wings of Desire\"...yes, it was that bad!",

But emptiness is not like a vacuum, but like a kind of white substance, like a light spectrum consisting of many shades.

And while watching it, it's hard to believe that there is no God. Even though I can't call myself a believer. The story takes consciousness with it from the first notes. Into myself. I do not know how I would take this on a laptop, but it is still important to go to the cinema for a movie. Otherwise, many sensations slip away.A story that is difficult to describe in the abstract. I don't understand their phenomenon for cinema at all. It's better sometimes not to read at all. You will never be able to imagine it as it really is. There will be other colors and shapes.Therefore, I do not want to get into the meanings that are embedded in this work. I just want to say that it's worth touching. And that it's worth living for.

The awkwardness of her performance reaches a painful apogee in the scene in the club. I found her egoistic style of acting very embarrassing, and it ruined the movie for me. Too bad, because the performance of Bruno Ganz, the cinematography, the script and the score had great potential. To me it is an exemplar of how one bad performance can poison everything else. I found it very difficult to become engaged in this movie.",
