            "content": "Au Revoir, Les Enfants (1987) ****What is this film? Is it just a deeply moving, real film? Is it something more - an exorcism of sorts? Louis Malle's 1987 masterpiece 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' has had much said about it due to its personal nature for Malle. When the movie played at Telluride, Malle cried, tears streaming down his cheeks. I knew the first time i saw the film that it was autobiographical, so perhaps this helped make the film affect me a little more strongly. Whatever the case, Malle has created a heart breaking work of genius.In a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France, Julien Quietin, played by Gaspard Manesse as the character based around Malle, is no ordinary student. He is intelligent and different from the others. The school is also no ordinary boarding school- it has a secret. A new student arrives at the school one day, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejt\u00f6) and becomes a sort of intellectual rival to Julien. After some early hostilities the boys begin to connect, and eventually become good friends. Malle does not rely on overly dramatic sequences where not necessary as a way to build up the plot. Instead he shows us the monotonous daily routines of life at the school: prayers, mass, classes, music and exercise classes, and even air-raids. Eventually, Julien comes to realize that his new friend is a Jew. He is too young to really understand what the big deal is. What is the problem with Jews he later asks? During parents visitation, Julien takes Jean along with his family as Jean has not seen his father in two years, or heard from his mother in months. While at the restaurant, French collaborators come in and begin harassing a long time customer because he is Jewish in a 'No-Jews-allowed' restaurant. Things seem like they are about to explode for the young boys but to their, and our, surprise the collaborators are thrown out by some German soldiers who are eating at the next table over. We see the fear in Jean's eyes every time the Germans come near, and in one intimately close instance after the boys had been lost in the woods and stumbled upon a road and unrealizingly flag down a car driven by Nazi soldiers, Jean's turn to actions as he attempts to run away only to be caught. The soldiers do not realize that Jean is a Jew, or that the priest has been hiding Jews at his school. After all, why would they? They drive the boys back to the school. These scenes work like magic on screen. The actions and words are hauntingly real and often naive. One day the Gestapo arrives looking for a Jean Kippelstein, and in a moment of unconscious reaction, Julien unwittingly outs his friend. The Jewish students are rounded up, and the priest, Father Jean, is taken away with them and the school is now to be closed. Louis Malle has said that he wanted to make this film a long time ago, but could not find the strength. The film is not a direct parallel to the real events, but perhaps more a parallel to Malle's memories and guilt about the incidence. The end result on film is a stunningly beautiful and incredibly touching portrait of friendship, guilt, frustration and anger and I'm sure it worked wonders for Malle as an exorcism of his past. Sometimes there are moments we almost don't realize take place, and often they can be some of the most important in our lives, and 'Au Revoir, Les Enfants' is a haunting testament to how these moments can change your life, for better or for worse.4/4",

            "content": "\"More than 40 years have passed, but I'll remember every second of that January morning until the day I die.\"Part of what makes this autobiographical film from Louis Malle so powerful is that a big portion of its coming of age material is universal. In a Catholic boarding school we see hazing and random bullying while ineffectual headmasters look the other way, bedwetting, reading after hours, playground battles, curiosity about girls, and the kind of childhood events that get remembered for life, like getting lost in the woods. In other words, it's just boys trying to get through the difficulties of growing up, and really could be any group of boys, at any time.But of course this isn't just any period, it's occupied France during WWII, and while the school full of affluent kids seems mostly insulated from that, danger lurks. Three new boys who have been admitted and given new names are secretly Jews, a fact which gradually becomes known by Julien, one of the smarter students (Gaspard Manesse, playing the young Malle). He has a rivalry and a friendship with one of the new boys (played soulfully by Rapha\u00ebl Fejt\u00f6), and the nuances of their relationship not only felt authentic, but it made it hard to know how the film would play out.I love the dimensions of the film, including the differing Catholic responses to the Jewish issue in Vichy France - some good, some bad. There is also an axis of rich/poor, and I loved the sermon where the priest shocks the visiting parents by criticizing the behavior of the wealthy. Lastly, the use of the Chaplin film 'The Immigrant' (1917) within the film is pitch perfect, and a masterful touch.",

            "content": "Possible SPOILERS. After having led a roaming and chaotic life during more than ten years abroad, Louis Malle came back in France and made the movie he was always to make. This one was rewarded in Venise where it won the golden Lion in 1987. \"au revoir les enfants\" tells the story of a friendship between the son of a wealthy family, Julien and a Jew boy, Jean Bonnet hidden under a false identity. However, at first sight, nothing lets see the start of a friendship between Julien and Jean. Julien feels admiration and curiosity towards this new student but we don't really know why and Jean pretends not to see him. A few events will bring them closer, especially a treasure hunt in the woods... It's a touching, moving and finally tragic story because the intervention of the Gestapo will lead this friendship to an end between the two boys. It's not the first time that a Louis Malle's movie takes place during the second world war. In 1974, \"Lacombe Lucien\" told the story of a young peasant who found his place in the Gestapo. If this movie had divided the French public, \"au revoir les enfants\" will provoke the unanimity. Both movies are successful and strong but \"Lacombe Lucien\" is a rough fiction whereas the other one is partly autobiographical. With this movie, Malle eagered to recall a memory that upset him when he was at school: the arrest of a few Jew children who were hidden under a false identity. This is this memory that he filmed in the last sequence. This last one is carefully prepared and filmed in the minute details as if Malle wanted to recall exactly what he saw it and then don't think about it definitely. This is one of Malle's most beautiful movies and his last great one.",

            "content": "The movie was a project close to Louis Malle's heart (he was in tears when the film premiered at a film festival in 1987) and it shows in the multi-layered treatment he gives the central setting, this fascinating boarding school with its broad cast of characters. Because there are so many different strands and affecting moments tangential to the central plot, one is not entirely prepared for the finale even if you are expecting it. French film is characteristically digressive, often to a fault, but here it works to splendid advantage. It also lends itself to repeat viewings.I don't think you need to have lived in occupied Europe to appreciate this wonderful film; it speaks to all of us who have lived through childhood's quickly-passing parade and know its lifelong regrets. That last image of the stone wall is emblazoned in many consciousnesses, as it is in mine.There are many interesting choices Malle makes in this film. For example, while the central subject is the Holocaust, nearly all the Germans we actually see in the film are fairly decent if nonetheless menacing types. The real villains here are almost entirely French collaborators, which was done I think to call attention to collaboration during a period when the French were dealing with the Klaus Barbie trial. [Barbie was a Gestapo officer who was aided in his work rooting out Resistance leaders by many French collaborators.] But casting French people as the heavies also suggests the central evil of prejudice and oppression is not something exclusive to one nationality, and it broadens the scope of the movie.The tender treatment Malle affords the Catholic hierarchy in the movie is unusual, too, when you see other more anti-clerical Malle efforts like \"Murmur of the Heart.\" There is an unexpected sense of spirituality throughout this film, somewhat muted but there all the same.This may well stand as the cinematic masterpiece of a man who, at his best (see also \"Atlantic City\" and \"My Dinner With Andre\") was to motion pictures what his countrymen Zola and Hugo were to novels: An artist who filled his canvas with the verve and breadth of human life.",

            "content": "After a few years making movies in the United States, Louis Malle returned to his native France and made \"Au revoir les enfants\", based on his memories of growing up in Nazi-occupied France. The movie focuses on the friendship between two boys in a Carmelite boarding school, one of whom is keeping his real identity secret.A particularly effective scene is in the restaurant. There are some Wehrmacht officers at a table, but they keep to themselves. Then the Milice enters and orders a Jewish patron out of the restaurant. The Wehrmacht officers then order the Milice to leave. This emphasizes not only the role of the Vichy government, but also the role of the collaborators in every country that Germany occupied.I haven't seen all of Malle's movies, but this is probably the best of his movies that I've seen. The final scene has to be one of the most chilling in cinema history. I recommend the movie.",

            "content": "In 1944, the upper class boy Julien Quentin (Gaspard Manesse) and his older brother Fran\u00e7ois travel to the Catholic boarding school in the countryside after vacations. Julien is a leader and good student and when the new student Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejt\u00f6) arrives in the school, they have friction in their relationship. However, Julien learns to respect Jean and discovers that he is Jewish and the priests are hiding him from the Nazis. They become best friends and Julien keeps the secret of the origins of Jean. When the priest Jean (Philippe Morier- Genoud) discovers that the servant Joseph (Fran\u00e7ois N\u00e9gret) is stealing supplies from the school to sell in the black market, he fires the youth. Sooner the Gestapo arrives at school to investigate the students and the priests that run and work in the boarding school.\"Au Revoir les Enfants\" is an awarded film written and directed by Louis Malle apparently based on true events during World War II in the boarding school where he studied. The touching story of friendship and betrayal is beautiful and sad, and the boys have great performances. Louis Malle highlights the despicable behavior of collaborators and traitor and the most impressive, the German soldiers are tough but respectful with the French civilians. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Adeus, Meninos\" (\"Goodbye, Boys\")",

            "content": "Upon the first viewing of Au revoir les enfants, we are as engrossed into the mystery of Jean Bonnet as the young Julien Quentin is. And on a second viewing, the little clues become a great deal clearer, and we are able to piece together the puzzle a little quicker than the inquisitive young boy. But of course the modern older viewer has the frame of context and knowledge that Julien does not have - he knows the telltale signs of a Jew, but cannot figure out why they are hunted and persecuted so diligently, when all he sees is one of his close friends. And so the entire film is tinged in regret; even as Jean reminds him that he would have been caught anyway, we feel the chain of events that lead to that monumental morning being so painful to remember, and that one fatal glance that led to a death on his hand. Louis Malle works with his memories and experiences, and here he has crafted a group of young schoolboys so reminiscent and convincing. He has captured that remarkable knack and ability of young boys to be able to hastily create relationships out of nothing, sever them, and hastily mend them all over. They pipe up at any opportunity to make a joke on someone else's behalf, and take playful violence to the limit, and are all friendly the next day. And any child would remember cheering whenever they got a break from school-work - here it is within the grim context of air raids, but they cheer anyway, and when the teacher starts a prayer, they all instinctively join in. Why this succeeds is that Malle does not overdo the World War 2 setting; these boys certainly do not take the war so seriously, so he takes on that viewpoint. They playact as knights on stilts and knock each other over as real soldiers fight, but it might as well be another day for them. They trade books with dirty stories in them, and cackle at a rare viewing of Chaplin. When a German soldier stands up to a French collaborator in the restaurant and the whole establishment rallies around an elderly Jewish customer, there is an sinister undercurrent about it, but this is viewed through the innocent lens of Julien, who seems to know that what is happening is bad, and instinctively covers for his Jewish friend, but does not understand why being Jewish is bad thing. He is at the centre of the narrative, at the tender age where he is still a mummy's boy, but like many blossoming teenagers puts on a braver, cooler front: indeed his first lines to Jean are a thinly veiled threat to not mess with him. He has little moments of cheekiness and intelligence, bartering his mother's jam and pretending to drown in the bathtub to avoid the wrath of taking too long. And there is a subplot of his uncertainty around his future aspirations that links towards the courageous actions of the priest P\u00e8re Jean; mentors whisper that he does not quite have the calling of priesthood, and his mother coddles and suggests taking on the same occupation as his father in engineering, and in the same vein his piano playing is not quite up to scratch, so he is recommended taking up violin. But he does have those same qualities as P\u00e8re Jean anyway. A bitter Joseph mocks him for being so pious and generous when it is war and it is every man for himself - \"They're just Jews,\" he spits outs. But it is the rejection of this statement by Julien that rings so true and brave - it is in those small acts of defiance, and those brief friendships that shine brightly in the darkness of the Holocaust, that our humanity remains.",

            "review_title": "Best french movie, highly recommended",
            "content": "\"Goodbye children\" is to director Louis Malle what \"The Pianist\" has been to Roman Polanski. These are movies that dealt with intimate matters related to painful childhood experiences, both taking place in occupied Europe during WW2. In both cases, it is palpable that they were movies that these directors had planned to make for a long time, but they waited until they had achieved a considerable degree of recognition at the end of their careers, so that they would feel self assured enough to carry their project out.\"Goodbye children\" evolves around two essential guidelines : the first one is the historical background of France during WW2. The second one is about childhood friendship and loss.There are quite a lot of movies that were set in France during WW2, but the matter of collaboration of the French with the Germans was still a sensitive subject in 1987. A decade before, Louis Malle had made a film called \"Lacombe Lucien\", portraying a young French peasant entering the Gestapo as a way of social promotion, and it caused quite a controversy. Things had quietened a bit though, when \"Goodbye children\" came out, and most of the people who had lived through the period as children seemed to be pleasantly reminded of childhood memories, as the boarding school and its characters appears to be a very good reflection of reality.Ugly as it has been, collaboration was nothing else as a survival policy. In war time and or/dictatorship, people rarely afford to have moral dilemmas, and this is well shown in the movie as a thriving black market goes on among children at the boarding school. The character of Joseph, an illiterate limping cook, is the one who gets blamed when the black market scandal breaks out, and loses his job. He is also the one who is going to sell out everybody, by revenge. He betrays because he feels betrayed. When one has seen \"Lacombe Lucien\", it impossible not to make a link between the two characters.\"Goodbye children\" is also a very good study of the division among French people at the time. When an old Jewish man is arrested at the restaurant by the French \"milice\" (political police under the Vichy regime), there is as much applause as protest. What comes as a surprise is the positive role played by the church, impersonated here by Father Jean, who is in fact a resistant hiding Jewish children and holds provocative sermons during mass. There definitely existed such priests, and it is all the more surprising to get that portrayal from a left-wing director like Louis Malle.The plot evolves around two very different young boys. One, Julien, comes from a typical French upper-class family, he is both gifted and spoiled. The other, Jean, is the typical Jewish boy, brilliant but secretive. Of course, no one among the college boys knows that Jewish kids are hiding there under false identities. Julien is at first both irritated and intrigued by this odd rival, but as they confront, they gradually become implicit allies. Their bonding is well illustrated by a few scenes, for example when they get lost together in the woods, or when they play piano during a bomb alert.As it can be expected from twelve year old boys, they only scantly express an attachment which becomes all the more real. The very fact that a film about child friendship is done by a director who is past fifty is a revealer of its very importance in a whole lifetime. Julien only realizes the price of it when Jean is arrested by the Gestapo, and waves discreetly as he walks out the college door, never to be seen again. The final shot of Julien's disarrayed face, which appears chillingly mature for the first time, is a very powerful one. But well, Louis Malle was not an amateur.\"Goodbye children\" is also a major film about loss, and it gets all the more effective in doing so that it ends abruptly, leaving you with a feeling of irreversibility. You never quite know how long you are going to know someone, how long you still will be there, you are rarely quite aware when you see someone for the last time. It is only when people are gone forever that you can realize how meaningful they were to you.If you are studying French or interested in French culture, this is really a movie which, as a Frenchman myself, I would recommend because it is both excellent, accessible and representative. Unsurprisingly, it received several Cesars, including the one of the best film of the year (Cesars are our French equivalent of Oscars).",

            "content": "On seeing this movie several years ago my accompanying colleagues said of the film: what a load of self-indulgent, confusing, French stylized rubbish. They bemoaned the slow pace of the film, of the 2 dimensional directing and lack of any action or violent death scenes!Those words still linger with me now and has made me realise that perhaps a lot of the movie-going public these days feed on the latest sfx pyrotechnics, more ingenious ways of abstract killings, lots of needless sex and not letting a good intelligent story get in the way.Films like Les Enfants are going to be even more difficult to track down if Hollywood and some of the European studios opt for the fast Buck route to riches.Les Enfant is a truly wonderful & yet harrowing account of life in a Catholic boys boarding school during the dying embers of the Nazi occupation of France in WW2. One of the new boys happens to be Jewish but the headmaster chooses to keep such identities covert while still offering him sanctuary and an education in spite of all the risks he takes.To be fair I know little of Louis Malle previous to this film, but I think he must have poured his life's soul into writing & directing Les Enfant.No detail, harrowing or otherwise, is spared; we see so much beauty amongst the horrors of occupation & collaboration; but also the blossoming relationship between the two lead boys and how initial envy & hatred of the Jew is somewhat diluted by the realities that this is no infantile school game but that life and death for the Jewish boy hangs by a thread if anyone at the school should reveal his true identity.The final moments are perhaps one of the most sad & dramatic scenes I have ever seen. These days a lot of people would be waiting for some great heroic entrance from a big movie star to sort out all the misery and leave us with a reassurance that \"it really wasn't all that bad back then was it\".But there are no heroes at the end of this movie, at least not the kind of heroes Hollywood serves up. The boys in this film are the true heroes right to the very end, primarily for their spirit of humanity in the face of impossible odds.This is the hard reality of war amongst children growing up not only in the face of their own adolescence (and all the problems that serves), but also with the dark fingered claw of Nazism hanging menacingly like the the Scythe of the Grim Reaper.This film will move you in so many directions and will hopefully bring you back down to earth from the current Hollywood shallow circus of pap & style-over-content.Its a difficult film to track down, and the reason for this can be attributed to the first paragraph of this review.*****/*****",

The main actors are boys, and they play their parts with unusual conviction, unexaggerated but with intensity. And the anti-Semitism that arises, though inevitable in Nazi territory, comes subtly and really stings. The movie isn't complete without this horror, but the horror is made complete by the really vivid recreation of this kind of private boys school--a period movie at its best.Director Louis Malle has not only a message, but a sensitive feel for the medium--for making fluid the flow and background of the plots of his films. It's also a fairly complex mix of types, and you can somehow keep them all straight as it goes--as straight as you are meant to as the facts unfold.

Malle and the actors adroitly juggle circumstances and emotions.

And what, admittedly not enough but enough to judge him a very talented director with some great films in his filmography, has been seen so far of Louis Malle has not been less than good or interesting, which is a much better standard for most directors in lesser efforts. Some films when directors were at their worst were real misfires.1987's 'Au Revoir Les Enfants', translated into English as \"goodbye children\", is semi-autobiographical and is Malle's most personal film, being very much a memoir. It also is a contender for his most emotionally powerful film and is among his very best. What's more, 'Au Revoir Les Enfants' is a fantastic film on its own, one of the best and most emotional films seen in a long time. Its two Oscar nominations, for foreign language film and original screenplay, as well as many other awards (wins and nominations), were more than richly deserved.Malle is a big reason as to why 'Au Revoir Les Enfants' makes as much impact in the way it does. There is so much passion and sensitivity in his directing, and he does it without sentimentalising or being gratuitously graphic in its depiction of friendships and cruelty. The film manages to be uncompromising and remarkably does not take sides, which was unexpected for a subject as difficult as this one (as difficult as one can get).It's beautifully filmed, without being over-glamorous and with the right amount of grit. On top of not being one-sided in its depiction of a brave subject, 'Au Revoir Les Enfants' is also one of the honest and poignant portrayals of friendship and youth, again because of the realism and not sentimentalising even though there are parts that are appropriately gentle. In a way that's easy to relate to. There is some nice use of Schubert and Saint Saens too.The script provokes a lot of thought. The ending is chills personified and really brought tears to my eyes. The portrayal of war and its impact on the characters is harrowing, although the pace is slow it never felt dull due to being so emotionally invested. The characters are very much rootable and well acted across the board, have not seen such beyond the years performances from younger cast members in a while.Overall, fantastic. 10/10",

The plot covers his relationship with a newly arrived enigmatic student with whom he's at odds at first but the two learn to get along & share a big secret.Directed by Louis Malle, the film is nicely crafted with many details beautifully captured by its calmly moving camera. The screenplay tries to get an authentic vibe of education in Catholic schools, the conversations between its characters carry the childlike innocence & the performances by its cast, especially the child actors, becomes more captivating as the story progresses.On an overall scale, Au Revoir Les Enfants (also known as Goodbye Children) isn't in anyway a hard-hitting or emotionally scarring cinema but the gentle manner in which it depicts its premise really makes you care for its characters, makes you wish they get away, makes you wish for a miracle & although its subject matter has been dealt in a better manner, the film is worthy of a watch for its two main characters alone.",

            "content": "Louis Malle's Au Revoir Les Enfants goes head to head with Truffaut's the 400 Blows to creating *the* French film about what's real, and sometimes dark and terrifying, about childhood. Both films have conflicted young protagonists who are just starting to become teenagers, and faced with a question: how to live, or just react, in the world around them? In the case of Malle's film, however, there's a lot more going on in the personal side of things than just an outsider/petty criminal. It's about a boy who finds a friend, without really going out of his way, and then that friendship ending because of something that neither boy can control since one happens to be a Jew. The film doesn't start as some haunting elegy to youth, but by the end it becomes just that, and about the very crucial act of remembering.Indeed, one of the many strengths of Malle's masterpiece (his best film perhaps alongside Murmur of the Heart, also about a boy) is that it's so carefully remembered from forty years past and brought to life, as if it were happening today, at least emotionally. It's set in a Catholic all-boy's school in 1944 where Julien Quentin is off to learn and be away from his mom and dad, the latter he barely ever sees. There's a new boy, Jean Bonnet, who is attending the school, and immediately (perhaps predictably) he's picked on and bullied, though nothing too terrible that he can't bounce back. He somehow connects with Jean over the coming months, as they become stranded in the woods during a treasure hunt, one teaches the other piano, and Julien sees something rather startling: Jean praying at night with candles out and in a language he doesn't understand. Something else he discovers is his real name- Jean Kippelstein- and that he's a Jew. He has to asks someone first what a Jew is, the response from one of his school-mates simply \"A Jew doesn't eat pork.\" Malle observes the ways of children without interfering with them, but at the same time creating an atmosphere that is so real that the hangups with melodrama never get in the way. The little dramas of an everyday school-boy life, or just the side-issues at the school (trading objects black-market style, sneaking around a copy of Arabian Nights, keeping up with playing be it on stilts in the playground), or, as it turns out, Julien's own little problems. What Malle does is subtle but extraordinary; by letting the story unfold in this gradual style, with little events building upon one another, a whole picture emerges of the story of these two friends set against this backdrop of Catholic highs and lows, French occupation by the Nazis, and the hint that there may be more than one Jew at the school - one where anti-semitism is noticed but not well experienced. We don't get a full dose of this reality until the scene at a restaurant, where Julien, Jean and Julien's family see it first-hand.There is a message Malle wants to convey of course, about the ultimate horror of the Nazi regime on good people, some innocent and some trying to do the right thing by hiding others, and we see this particularly in the climax of the story when the Germans come to the school to sniff out any/all Jewish refugees. But this isn't precisely paramount for Malle, or rather it's not the full reason one senses why he made the film and why it's so personal. It's because he knew these people, and that it's about friends and being cared for and being in a bond like the one Julien and Jean have. I wondered going in to the film if it would be more conventional, that it would be about Julien having to hide this secret from the other kids and something building to a point of Jean being found out.It doesn't work like that, really, except that Malle throws in a hint of existential turmoil: when asked in the class who is Jean Kippelstein Julien, who is the only one who knows, turns his head ever so briefly to Jean, but it's enough to signal the German as to who he is. What's so clever, and just devastating, about this is that it's not Julien's fault, ultimately, if Jean were to be caught, since as it turns out the school is turned upside down for anyone, and eventually three are brought out of the school and sent to Auschwitz. But, by the look on Julien's face, caught in a grip of tragedy, he feels in this moment as an adolescent as if it is his fault. Au revoir les enfants is never forced dramatically and all of its acting and scenes until the last ten minutes are so unforced that its ending is all the more crushing to the soul. It's a heart-rending, powerfully directed portrait of youth, in its ups and downs, and a year that must never be forgotten - not a moment.",

What I especially like about it is that it offers a view that is not typical of other films (i.e., the perspective of children in a boarding school). This unusual perspective lifts it about other holocaust films--nearly to the same level as the wonderful Shop On Main Street (from Czechoslovakia). It, too, had an unusual perspective.The one thing, though that surprised me was that there were some sympathetic German soldiers in the film--such as the one who told the self-important French collaborator to leave the restaurant and leave the Jewish man alone as well as the apparently decent soldiers that brought the two lost boys home. Though surprising, it did add to the picture in that both good and bad Germans as well as good and bad Frenchmen are presented.This film would be acceptable to watch by most anyone. Despite Malle having made many non-family friendly films, this one has very little objectionable material. For younger viewers, I would recommend watching the film with them, as it is sure to bring up a lot of confusion and emotional issues for younger viewers.",

Told from the boyhood viewpoint of children, it captures the fearful nature of children under enormous pressure from outside sources they cannot comprehend.The semi-biographical account by Louis Malle of a time he spent at such a boarding school is driven by the focus on two boys: Julien (GASPARD MANESSE) and Jean (RAPHAEL FEJTO), a French boy and a Jewish lad, respectively. They carry the main burden of the story and are both excellent in a cast that is uniformly good.The rambunctious behavior of a bunch of Catholic school boys is something I can relate to personally, having sung in a choir as a boy where I was surprised at the ruffians who, behind the scenes, were like street youths full of boyish pranks and rough-housing, until summoned to walk out to the altar of the church, hands clasped in front of them like little cherubs. This aspect of the French boys in the film rang true to me, their behavior being very true to life.The story is compelling, dealing as it does with the Nazis determined to find every Jewish lad they could, aided sometimes by collaborators who for one reason or another turned in Jews to the German officers. The ending is particularly poignant and well acted.Highly recommended and stands as a reminder of the cruelties of childhood and war.",

Beyond just being the typical \"movie during class!\" experience, I thought it was pretty amazing anyway: the two children actors who play Julien and Bonnet are extremely talented and perfectly encapsulate two children of the period, the story is heart-felt and visceral at the same time, and the ending has a tendency to stick in ones conscience.At the very least you have that. But in the context of the 3 Films of Louis Malle box set released through Criterion, it has its own aspect of interest. The first is how it combines the two themes of the previous two films, coming-of-age and the German occupation of France, into what Malle seems to be wanting to talk about all along. The most important thing is that this time it's true. You don't even need to research that, you can feel it as you watch.Not that it isn't without it's stylizations of cinema, but that's what makes it great. Especially amazing is the fear that runs throughout it, even in smaller scenes. The two key moments involving this fear, though, are especially great: the woods and the end. The woods are mostly childish fear, illusive and imagined, yet it gets the spectator's heart pounding. The end is real, and thus much more disturbing and helpless. The change in maturity of the character moves from an abstract (\"I think about death all the time\") to a concrete (\"I'll remember every second of that day for the rest of my life\"), and yet the feeling of fear through an artist's mind is still a drive to create something as strong and engaging as this work.--PolarisDiB",

It was not an easy for Jean Bonnet, the newly arrived boy to settle into a world that was totally foreign to him.One thing becomes clear immediately, Jean was a smart kid, way ahead of his classmates. He was an easy object of ridicule because of his introspective nature. At the same time, Jean attracted the attention of Julien Quentin, who went on to become Jean's best friend, and whose life was touched by the incident he lived at the school. Life in the boarding school was not a happy one for many of the children. Being away from family took a heavy toll on most of them, while for others was a great time to be away in a somewhat safe environment. Justin, who spies on Jean as he prays during the night, is the first to discover his real identity, which was a well kept secret. In fact, Justin is quite concerned as the boys are brought to a bath house knowing Jews were not welcome. The same goes when during mass, Jean makes an attempt to receive communion from one of the priests, who clearly knew he was not catholic and passes him by without giving him the sacrament. The film is Louis Malle's tribute to a similar incident he lived during his boyhood. It is the most autobiographical of his work, dedicated to his children. \"Au revoir les enfants\" is a timeless account about an era in which the horrors of the war was seen through the eyes of innocent children, totally at sea in the madness going on around them. The gloomy winter atmosphere was photographed by Renato Berta, a frequent collaborator of Mr. Malle.The two principals do an excellent work. Gaspard Manesse who played Justine Quentin and Raphael Fejto, showed great promise, but did not go into great screen careers as one would have hoped.",

Lovingly and desperately inspired by his own childhood attending a French Catholic boarding school where a handful of Jewish children were being hidden, \"Au Revoir, Les Efants\" is a film of small moments leading to one of the most heartbreaking finales you will ever see. What makes it so tragic and resonant is the subtle build-up. Malle's on-screen alter ego Julien is a spoiled kid who reluctantly befriends one of the new kids who he later discovers is Jewish. The progression of their friendship and the day-to-day activities at the school are done without one bit of pretense and so laize-faire, that when the accidental betrayal occurs with a simple glance in the classroom witnessed by the Gestapo, it happens so casually and naturally that neither we, nor Julien, can even begin to process it until long after the film has ended. That's subtle film-making at its best.Louise Malle crafted a masterpiece showing both the innocent child's view of WWII and the almost insane passivity adopted not only by the French (who didn't seem to mind being occupied as long as they could drink their wine and smoke their cigarettes) but by a greater portion of the world that was asleep at the wheel and allowed the Holocaust to happen. With nary a scene of violence or warfare to be found on the screen, \"Au Revoir, Les Efants\" is probably the most low-key film you will ever find on the topic, and long after it's over, its universal themes and quiet tragedies will haunt you.",

The only relevant question should be,Is it any good? Answer: an overwhelming Yes. Malle waited years before he attempted to recapture the key incidents of his youth if not, indeed, his life and the result is a superb film, arguably far better than a younger Malle, much closer in time to the events would have produced. I write as someone born and bred in England, a country very much a part of the War in question but one never actually invaded so I am not really qualified to expound on the rights and wrongs of portraying the occupying Germans in a somewhat sympathetic light and the French activists as the heavies as Malle has opted to do here presumably because that is how he remembers it. The film stands or falls on the two schoolboy protagonists, one representing the young Louis Malle, the other the Jewish boy whom he befriended at school and watched being led off by the Gestapo in the final reel and both are magnificent. It is, significantly, Malle's own voice we hear at the very end affirming how strongly his life was affected by that major incident.

Malle's film depicts the intense trauma of Jewish children who were separated from their families and forced to take on a new identity in hiding, always afraid of being found out. They also faced the dilemma of how to maintain their Jewishness in the setting of a Catholic school.

Malle takes an almost journalistic approach, not ever using music or directorial flourishes to tell us how we should be feeling, but rather letting the fine performances and powerful subject matter speak for themselves. The boys never become necessarily close friends, but they do form a bond forged by loneliness and a mutual respect, which evolves into genuine concern as the one gradually awakens to the very real danger the other faces for being Jewish.I believe this film is largely autobiographical, and you can tell it is even if you didn't know that going in. It just has that personal touch that autobiographical films have, something you can't necessarily define but which you recognize when you see it.

Unfortunately, children often act before they think. This film is subtle. It's about a friendship. Louis Malle, a king among directors, never beats us up with the events. Watching this with hindsight, it made me very sad. I also see that even in our own country, certain groups are now being minimalized. We need to learn from history.",

            "content": "''Au Revoir Les Enfants'' is a very touching film about two children in a French boarding school who form a bond and share a dangerous secret. The film reflects the director's childhood life, Louis Malle, who as a kid witnessed three Jewish children and a priest being deported to Auschwitz during his stay in a boarding school. Deeply moving and realistic, ''Au Revoir Les Enfants'' is a film about friendship which challenges the viewer's emotions.Malle directs the film with great care and makes sure that his characters go through their emotional journey without revealing themselves instantly. This gives great realism to the film as well as to its actors' performances. At 104 minutes, the film takes its time but by the end, we have witnessed an entire voyage of two children who despite their initial conflicts, come together and unveil their sensitive sides as children. Malle's direction does all that and the result is a film that doesn't force the audience to shed a tear like a melodrama rather than just tell us a powerful true story of bondage with realism.Being a film where most of the characters are children, it would be very difficult to drain amazing performances from the leads. However, Louis Malle's meticulous direction allows the film to have a great emotional impact on the audience while guiding his young actors through the story. The two young protagonists (Gaspard Manesse, Rapha\u00ebl Fejt\u00f6) give very natural performances which contribute very nicely to the film. They do not try to show off but they gradually expose themselves to the emotions and situations they find themselves in. What makes the children's performances so effective is that they portray authenticity . Their performances are raw and honest (At the end of the film, Manesse's performance leaves a very strong mark as he watches his best friend leaving with the Gestapo and waves at him while tearing silently, knowing that he will never see him again).The film features no musical score (other than the children playing the piano in some parts of the film) but it proves not to be a weakness to the film's powerful story. Louis Malle's script is carefully written, clever and poignant.If you are into films with a good, simple and moving story along with great performances, this is a recommend French classic that even after 26 years since its initial release, evokes strong emotions to its audience.",

Much like Vittorio de Sica's THE HOUSE OF THE FINZI-CONTINIS, this one also transpires behind the relative safety of walls, walls which belong to a boarding school where Jewish boys are enrolled under assumed names and protected by their teachers. Two boys in particular become fast friends, and the main character, Julien (Gaspard Manesse) eventually becomes the innocent bystander who witnesses and tells of these horrible events which we never see -- in an ode to the preservation of innocence, they're kept off stage even though we know they are, like a noose, tightening around the school. If the Holocaust, as a matter of fact, wouldn't be located strictly in the most remote background, this might be just another coming of age film about two boys growing up, but that gets a deeper resonance here and has a vague tone of dreamy languidness, like a prelude. A very delicately told story, it takes its time to reach its devastation, and by the end, it has left a lasting impact of silent horror.",

            "content": "Most coming of age stories usually revolve around resolving a personal conflict like an unrequited first love or something as inconsequential as not making a sports team. Being an adolescent in France in 1944 presented an entirely different scenario. No matter how protected you might have been, coming of age then meant getting exposure to serious issues at a young age.The story is that of two early-adolescent boys who have been sent to a private Catholic boarding school at some remove from heavily targeted areas. One boy, Julien, is the son of wealthy Parisians and the other, Jean, is a Jewish boy who has been taken in by P\u00e8re Jean, the school's director. The good priest has taken a great risk in hiding Jean at the school, since the Nazi occupiers and French collaborators are never far off.The film develops slowly and lulls you into thinking that not much is happening but, before you know it, you are emotionally committed.The whole cast is excellent; the two child actors are exceptional and perfect for their roles. The film skillfully captures the awkwardness young boys have in expressing their friendship, often to the point of self-denial. But Julien and Jean do ultimately become friends.The boys are at an age where they are feeling their way to an understanding of the world and being in the middle of WWII compounds the difficulties that all adolescents face in this. Julien hears comments about Laval, and P\u00e8tain and one kid comments that Jews and Russians are worse than the Nazis. It is difficult to resolve such conflicting opinions, even as an adult. How ill-fated it is that Julien's sudden revelation about his friend and the Nazis and the Jews resulted in unintended tragedy. Even though some of the Nazis are given a human face, by the end of the film Julien has no doubt who the bad guys are as evidenced by his physical withdrawal in the face of a young collaborator.It is refreshing to see priests presented in a favorable light. P\u00e8re Jean takes his faith seriously and, Christ-like, dies for his acts of compassion.Malle reports that this film is somewhat autobiographical and his making the movie gives testament to how innocent acts of youth that result in unfortunate consequences can haunt you for a lifetime.",

There is no plot, just random episodes that fail to sustain a narrative flow. There's an extended scene where the two main characters are separated from their troop while playing a game in the woods.

A tale of burgeoning friendship under trying circumstances, of children having to grow up faster than can reasonably be expected, the film delivers a sort of adult perspective seen thru children's eyes . Set at a boarding school during the German occupation of France in January 1944 we are privy to these young children's lives, there is no slick look at innocence here, this is a stark look at children coping with upheaval because they have to.It's dreamy in quality and not without dashes of humour, but Malle is really only setting us up for a finale that is very moving and puts the whole film into perspective. I was a bit annoyed to find that this is seen as the end part of a trilogy with Souffl\u00e9 au coeur, Le (1971) & Lacombe Lucien (1974) the previous instalments, but as a standalone this film is beautiful, and I have finally found a child performance that ranks alongside that of Aleksei Kravchenko in Idi i smotri (1985), because here Gaspard Manesse is simply amazing.Cracking film, 9/10.",

            "content": "The holocaust was perhaps unique, in the scope,efficiency and very banality of its evil. True art, at least my definition, brings the observer to the edge of experience, to that point of being of the moment depicted, but safely viewing it from the distance of the observer. I will never know what those who lived in fear of the dehumanization that was a prelude to mass racial slaughter experienced. Yet, in a strange way I do. This is a true story,not true in Hollywood terms, where a nucleus of actual actual events is shaped into a salable product. This was true in that it depicted Louis Malle's life in a Catholic boarding school during the Nazi occupation. And while all around him was in turmoil, while the slaughter of world war was reflected in the sound of distant bombs, something inexorable and universal was also occurring. Friendship, the enjoyment of one person of another. Two boys, bright enough to be competitors in being the best student in their class, connected. Their friendship was shown in the brief scene of their playing a simple ditty on an old piano, the pure joy of the timing, the sound and the laughter of music. For the young Malle, the school was an extension of the wealthy protected life of a child of a wealthy respected French family. The new student was more reserved, except when he had the answer to a math question that only he could explain to the class. Something didn't fit about his life story, however , until buried deep in his book case his real name was discovered, not Barnett, but Kippelstein. The slaughter of European Jews took place as I was only slowly becoming aware of a world outside of our little apartment in Washington D.C. Antisemitism for me was a fistfight, and my coming home with a bloody nose to my mother's arms. And then there were the letters from Europe after the war, written in Yiddish script, an arcane medium that only my Uncle Irving could read, as my entire family was transfixed around the table to hear whether some of our cousins, perhaps one or two, had survived. Kipplestein, millions of Kipplesteins, most died but a few lived. Representive Lantos was a Kipplestein, who survived to come to America, get his doctorate in Economics, and play a part in Congress. And he had two daughters, each one having large families to please their father who had lost everyone as a child. My friend Arnie, who would hang out at the Cafeteria with me after finishing his messenger job was a Kipplestein. I remember his words:---- \"When we got off the train the kids were separated into two lines, by age. I knew what was happening, so I bolted from the little one's lines and yelled, \"I'm strong I can work, I belong with the big kids.\" And so he was in a work detail throughout the war. I remember his saying, in his calm accepting voice, how he looked at the German kids his age, and marveled that they were walking free, while he had forgotten what it was like not to be marched, in unison.\" ---- Did Louis Malle's friend Kipplestein survive? Did he live a rich, full and happy life. Did he use his intellect to contribute to society? I said this is a true story, but the answer is really unimportant. The vast reality transcends the destiny of any one individual. The tragedy is those who did not live, whose lives were ended, who were exterminated by those who saw them as the vermin that the Nazi propagandists depicted. How easy it was for the SS members to do their jobs, to simply obey orders, not to risk being a trouble maker. I have the gnawing sensation whenever I back away from a challenge. Whenever I say, \"why bother,\" in the face of what I see as a mindset, a passive acceptance of injustice, that I am not being a Kipplestein, but following in the tradition of those SS who murdered them. I do miss my cousins whom I never knew. Those who were sent to the wrong line at the train station. I bet we would have been real friends.",

Joseph works at the school and trades with the boys on the black market.Filmmaker Louis Malle base this on his youth in a Roman Catholic school. This is compelling personal history of the larger story. However there is a lack of tension. It's never in doubt that Bonnet was a Jewish boy in hiding. It may help if he was a blonde hair, blue eyed boy. There are a couple of incidences where Bonnet is in the vicinity of being discovered but the tension never build. There is a lot of boys being boys like a 'Lord of the flies' lite. It's a bit annoying and directionless. I do like some scenes that don't go straight like the restaurant where the German troops kick out the french police trying to take a Jew. The movie probably needs to give Joseph more time and set him up for the big turning point. The movie should probably concentrate mostly on Julien, Bonnet and Joseph and lose half of the rest.",

            "content": "This film has great qualities and yet it has aged. War is the worst possible situation for any person who believes in freedom and honesty. War is a situation where lying is the norm, betraying the daily necessity to survive, and finding scapegoats is the only way to keep some sanity in a completely insane situation.In January 1944 in France Lying was on all sides. The Germans were lying about the situation in Ukraine and soon Poland. French radios, Paris, or other stations, were lying about the real situation in Europe five months before D-day. Everyone, on all sides, was ready to betray their sides if the situation was becoming too harsh, and the film shows how the Jews protected by the priests of this school were betrayed by people working in the school, people who took advantage of their situation to steal food and other things and sell them on the black market. A nurse did betray the Jewish boy hiding under some blankets on an infirmary bed. A thief working in the kitchen of the school jumped from blind and mute, as long as he was authorized to go on with some dishonest trafficking, but he became the main traitor when he was summoned to stop and leave.And that's what is missing in this poignant film on painful events. There were traitors on the German side too, informers and accomplices for the Resistance, and this is not shown properly. There would never have been thousands of Jewish children saved from deportation if there had not been some people on the German or P\u00e9tain's sides giving some information to the Resistance. They had to be informed of the movements of trains in order to blow them up; of German troops in order to ambush them, etc. That makes this film slightly one-sided, and it weakens its message. We have a war of this type right now in Europe, the second of this amplitude since 1945, in Ukraine, after Yugoslavia and Serbia.Can we be sure all Russian-speaking people there are supporting the Russian forces? Can we be sure all the Ukrainian-speaking people there are supporting the Ukrainian president? I would say, of course not, and the whole calculation we need to understand such a situation is where the dividing lines run. How long is it going to go on? How long will the west be able to provide billions of weapons without nurturing strong inflation and even eventually a recession? How long will they be able to provide heavy military equipment to soldiers who have never used it? How long will they be able to divert the demand for planes when we know all the pilots of the Ukrainian air force had been trained on Russian Migs and they cannot use western military planes. How long will the west be able to not send planes AND THE \u00a8PILOTS TO USE THEM, which would be direct intervention? It is very simple to see that one neutron bomb on the steel factory in Mariupol would clean up the place in about two hours. That's exactly the tactics used by the Americans - ALONE - in Hiroshima (A-bomb), Nagasaki (A-bomb), and Tokyo (phosphorus) in 1945.In a war, it is always the very same question that is to be answered. How long will each side accept to go on with it till they capitulate or negotiate? It took fifteen years for the Americans to accept some serious negotiation in Vietnam. It took eight years for the French to accept some serious negotiation in Algeria. It took nearly twenty years for the Americans to run away from Afghanistan. The list of such situations is long. In 1944 in France the Germans - and some French people - were playing their last pawns. Think of Papon sending the last trains full of Jews to Auschwitz something like one or two months before Bordeaux was liberated. And it took forty years or so for him to be tried for this crime.This film is very good emotionally but historically it is biased, which is not surprising for Louis Malle who used to make pamphlet films to stir the emotions of an audience. But deep under this surface, history is not captured, is not even brought up in its multiple contradictions, like the math teacher following the counteroffensive against the German in Russia, Ukraine, and Italy with little red flags on a map in his own class.Enjoy though the emotions of these kids who and which are superb.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAUVERSION FRAN\u00c7AISECe film a de grandes qualit\u00e9s et pourtant il a vieilli. La guerre est la pire situation possible pour toute personne qui croit en la libert\u00e9 et l'honn\u00eatet\u00e9. La guerre est une situation o\u00f9 le mensonge est la norme, o\u00f9 trahir est une n\u00e9cessit\u00e9 quotidienne pour survivre, et o\u00f9 trouver des boucs \u00e9missaires est la seule fa\u00e7on de garder un peu de raison dans une situation compl\u00e8tement folle.En janvier 1944, en France, le mensonge \u00e9tait pr\u00e9sent de tous les c\u00f4t\u00e9s. Les Allemands mentaient sur la situation en Ukraine et bient\u00f4t en Pologne. Les radios fran\u00e7aises, Paris ou d'autres stations, mentaient sur la situation r\u00e9elle en Europe cinq mois avant le jour J. Chacun, de tous les c\u00f4t\u00e9s, \u00e9tait pr\u00eat \u00e0 trahir son camp si la situation devenait trop dure, et le film montre comment les Juifs prot\u00e9g\u00e9s par les pr\u00eatres de cette \u00e9cole ont \u00e9t\u00e9 trahis par des personnes travaillant dans l'\u00e9cole, des personnes qui profitaient de leur situation pour voler de la nourriture et d'autres choses et les vendre au march\u00e9 noir. Une infirmi\u00e8re a trahi le gar\u00e7on juif qui se cachait sous des couvertures sur un lit d'infirmerie. Un voleur travaillant dans la cuisine de l'\u00e9cole est pass\u00e9 d'aveugle et muet, tant qu'il \u00e9tait autoris\u00e9 \u00e0 poursuivre un trafic malhonn\u00eate, \u00e0 bavard quand il est devenu le principal tra\u00eetre lorsqu'il a \u00e9t\u00e9 somm\u00e9 de s'arr\u00eater et de partir par la direction de l'\u00e9cole.Et c'est ce qui manque dans ce film poignant sur des \u00e9v\u00e9nements douloureux. Il y avait aussi des tra\u00eetres du c\u00f4t\u00e9 allemand, des informateurs et des complices de la R\u00e9sistance, et cela n'est pas montr\u00e9 correctement. Il n'y aurait jamais eu des milliers d'enfants juifs sauv\u00e9s de la d\u00e9portation s'il n'y avait pas eu des gens du c\u00f4t\u00e9 allemand ou de P\u00e9tain pour donner des informations \u00e0 la R\u00e9sistance. Il fallait les informer des mouvements des trains pour les faire sauter, des mouvements des troupes allemandes pour les pi\u00e9ger, etc. Cela rend ce film l\u00e9g\u00e8rement partial, et affaiblit son message. Nous avons actuellement une guerre de ce type en Europe, la deuxi\u00e8me de cette ampleur depuis 1945, en Ukraine, apr\u00e8s la Yougoslavie et la Serbie.Pouvons-nous \u00eatre s\u00fbrs que tous les russophones de ce pays soutiennent les forces russes ? Pouvons-nous \u00eatre s\u00fbrs que tous les ukrainophones soutiennent le pr\u00e9sident ukrainien ? Je dirais, bien s\u00fbr que non, et tout le calcul dont nous avons besoin pour comprendre une telle situation est de savoir o\u00f9 se trouvent les lignes de d\u00e9marcation. Combien de temps cela va-t-il durer ? Combien de temps l'Occident sera-t-il capable de fournir des milliards en armes sans alimenter une forte inflation et m\u00eame \u00e9ventuellement une r\u00e9cession ? Combien de temps pourront-ils fournir des \u00e9quipements militaires lourds \u00e0 des soldats qui ne les ont jamais utilis\u00e9s ? Combien de temps pourront-ils d\u00e9tourner la demande d'avions alors que nous savons que tous les pilotes de l'arm\u00e9e de l'air ukrainienne ont \u00e9t\u00e9 form\u00e9s sur des Mig russes et qu'ils ne peuvent pas utiliser des avions militaires occidentaux. Combien de temps l'Occident sera-t-il capable de ne pas envoyer d'avions ET LES \u00a8PILOTES POUR LES UTILISER, ce qui serait une intervention directe ? Il est tr\u00e8s simple de voir qu'une bombe \u00e0 neutrons sur l'usine d'acier de Marioupol nettoierait l'endroit en deux heures environ. C'est exactement la tactique utilis\u00e9e par les Am\u00e9ricains - SEULS - \u00e0 Hiroshima (bombe A), Nagasaki (bombe A) et Tokyo (phosphore) en 1945.Dans une guerre, c'est toujours \u00e0 la m\u00eame question qu'il faut r\u00e9pondre. Combien de temps chaque camp acceptera-t-il de continuer jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'il capitule ou n\u00e9gocie ? Il a fallu quinze ans aux Am\u00e9ricains pour accepter une n\u00e9gociation s\u00e9rieuse au Vietnam. Il a fallu huit ans aux Fran\u00e7ais pour accepter des n\u00e9gociations s\u00e9rieuses en Alg\u00e9rie. Il a fallu pr\u00e8s de vingt ans aux Am\u00e9ricains pour fuir l'Afghanistan. La liste de ces situations est longue. En 1944, en France, les Allemands - et certains Fran\u00e7ais - jouaient leurs derniers pions. Pensez \u00e0 Papon envoyant les derniers trains pleins de Juifs \u00e0 Auschwitz quelque chose comme un ou deux mois avant la lib\u00e9ration de Bordeaux. Et il a fallu attendre une quarantaine d'ann\u00e9es pour qu'il soit jug\u00e9 pour ce crime.Ce film est tr\u00e8s bon sur le plan \u00e9motionnel mais, sur le plan historique, il est biais\u00e9, ce qui n'est pas surprenant pour Louis Malle qui avait l'habitude de faire des films pamphlets pour susciter l'\u00e9motion du public. Mais sous cette surface, l'histoire n'est pas saisie, n'est m\u00eame pas \u00e9voqu\u00e9e dans ses multiples contradictions, comme le professeur de math\u00e9matiques qui suit la contre-offensive allemande en Russie, en Ukraine et en Italie avec des petits drapeaux rouges sur une carte dans sa propre classe, et il n'est pas arr\u00eat\u00e9 pour cela par la Gestapo bien que l'officier arrache les drapeaux, plut\u00f4t furieusement.Appr\u00e9ciez cependant les \u00e9motions de ces enfants qui et qui sont superbes.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU.",

            "content": "Goodye Children is the Engilsh translation of the title and director Louie Malle has created one of the best World War II dramas ever made. It is based on his childhood memories at a Catholic boarding school.Julien is a spoiled rich kid who is introduced to three new students, one of them, Jean, is very quiet, and his fellow classmates shun him. One night, Julien wakes up and sees Jean praying while wearing a yarmulke. It turns out that the school is hiding Jewish kids from the Nazis. The two slowly become friends, and when Julien's parents visit they bring Jean with them to a high class restaurant where German officers are dining. A patron is expelled during an ugly racist argument.A cook at the school is caught stealing food and selling it on the black market. In order to save himself he informs the Gestapo of the presence of Jewish hideaways and Jean is taken away. The priest in charge was also put in a camp by the Germans. The final part of the film is devastating and Malle has done the true story a great justice by this work.",

Simply told, beautifully composed and paced, it never once draws attention to the great story-telling and cinematic skills its director. The horror of the Holocaust, which has been told many times now in film, has never been depicted as quietly as this. The Germans who carry out the jobs, the French who collaborated with them, the honorable priests who are truly Christians are all seen through the eyes of a na\u00efve and innocent but observant adolescent boy. At the end of the film we are left as speechless as the boy who is the witness to this piece of history. A masterpiece.",

            "content": "Goodbye children is a very different WW2 movie which is based upon the account of childhood memory of director Louise Malle.This movie is different from any other WW2 era movie as it is not as much dark, emotional,dramatic and eventful as other WW2 movies but still very powerful and moving.The story is set in Nazi occupied France.The main character is a boy Julien Quentin who with his elder brother is sent to a catholic boarding school on the country side.There he became friend with a new student Jean Bonnet who is a Jew and hiding from Nazis under false identity.Julien find out the secret about Jean and the whole movie is based upon their life in the boarding school and how friendship developed between them.The ending of the movie is not very dramatic or emotional but leaves a great impact on us because of the personal touch of director.As the movie is based upon the childhood memory of Louise Malle,the feeling of how much the movie and the character of Julien is personal to the director is clearly visible in the movie (which is the greatest achievement of the movie) and this feeling involved the audience deeply in the movie.Because of this deep involvement the outcome of the ending of the movie filled the audience with a sense of guilt which the director(or Julien)feel about it's little mistake which is done unintentionally and cannot be corrected but it's burden can be reduce by sharing it with others and the Louise Malle succeeded in this this task completely.This movie is almost technically flawless and have everything for which i love European art cinema.The excellent cinematography of the movie turn the ordinary scenes with simple dialogues into a memorable scene. The camera work of the movie is outstanding for example,the tracking shot of Julien running in forest,it is short in length but it is one of the best tracking shot i have ever seen in my life.The movie based on brilliant plot with dramatic depth get perfect treatment from it's editing and camera work.I think this movie is the most suitable WW2 movie to show to children because this movie gives a view of holocaust era from the eye of a small boy without being much dark and violent.I just watched this movie twice in last 24 hours and i am giving this movie 9.5 of 10,and this movie goes at 59th position in my favorite 100 movies.",

            "content": "\" More than 40 years have passed, but I'll remember every second of that January morning until the day I die \"Subtly powerful and captivating tale from Louis Malle. After finishing the movie, I got to know that , it is actually based on true events from Louis childhood. My rating may seem little over the top for few of you, won't deny..but, I will try to explain the reason behind in following statements.First, the movie is slow and takes its time to set up the path for an incredible ending and in this process, our mind may wander and might even make you think, what's happening as we don't get that adrenaline moments to feel high. Having said that, this entire story is being shown from kids(Julien and Jean) perspective who are not completely aware of war and why Jews are being persecuted , all they care is fun, friendship, teasing the new guy amidst the chaos in the background. So, here Louis focused more on Julien and Jean bonding by threading scenes which makes their relation even more stronger with each passing minute and we do get couple of tense moments in the runtime which literally shows how tough it is for few people during Nazi occupied France.Louis didn't dramatize the events to make it look powerful or gut-wrenching, rather he chose subtle effective manner for depicting the events through kids pov and took his time to establish the core them around them and I say, it really worked for me. I will cite an example here, there is a scene in the movie, where a single glance from a kid changes entire mood of the film and I was literally hoping for a miracle there to help the other kid, such is the impact and you can see, how immersive I was and I even forgot the earlier slow pace issues.Entire cast did a wonderful job and all the young actors looks so natural on the screen, especially two kids Julien and Jean portrayed their roles so perfectly that , we gradually get attached to them and ending gets into your nerves. It might not be as hard hitting , tear jerking as other movies but still an Incredibly poignant movie from Louis. Giving this one an extra half for Louis and the two kidsAnd Irene Jacob <3.",

            "content": "All cinematic studies of The Holocaust are, by definition, bleak but this film, in my opinion, is the bleakest of them all. Perhaps that is because before you have seen even one German soldier, French collaborator or Gestapo official you have been thoroughly plunged by director Louis Malle into the cheerless, oppressive atmosphere of a penny pinching parochial school in winter. That this awful place has a decent, humanistic side, as shown by its willingness to risk severe sanctions for hiding a Jewish student, is but one of the several pieces of evidence in this work of Malle's greatness. Suffice it to say that in standard, less interestingly ambiguous treatments of this subject young Bonnet would be laboring under a false identity and, once discovered by school officials, quickly ratted out.Also brilliantly handled is the relationship between the Jewish student Bonnet and the Catholic Quentin that is the moral center of the film. Even in the early, hostile stages there are wisps of friendship and sympathy and once they are close there remain tension and jealousy until almost the very end. Again, in a lesser film the interaction between these two would be a simple progression from dark to light with no push/pull or two steps forward, one step back to give it greater emotional resonance or reality.Finally, there are the performances of the two teen actors who play Bonnet and Quentin. Not only do they completely inhabit the characters they are portraying but they do so naturally, with not a trace of stiffness or melodramatics. And when you get kid acting of this high a caliber then you must credit the director.Bottom line: He's not as well known, in America at least, as Godard, Truffaut or even (thanks to Sight And Sound) Akerman, but if there is a better Gallic film maker than Louis Malle I'd like to know who it is.

            "content": "Apart from the film's being somewhat autobiographical in nature for director Louis Malle, I didn't find the story to be that compelling. It lacks dramatic tension, as events that seem to be building into a confrontation with the Nazis all seem to dissipate for one reason or another. One example would be when Julien (Gaspard Manesse) and Jean (Raphael Fejt\u00f6) accidentally encounter the German soldiers seeking their way back from the outdoor competition. They're brought back to St. John's without much fanfare. A better example might be the scene that took place in the restaurant when French Vichy authorities attempted to rid an elderly Jewish customer and a Nazi officer came to his defense! Perhaps these events actually occurred and were witnessed by a young Malle during his childhood, but they didn't seem to translate dramatically on screen. Even the classroom removal of Jean Bonnet/Kippelstein didn't engender any real fear or paranoia as I expected it would; it simply proceeded along rather matter of factly. Of course the horrific message is brought home in the closing moments when Julien recounts the eventual demise of his classmates and school principal, but because it's dealt with as an off screen event AND as a forty year old memory, the impact is not what it could have been.I don't think the film had to entice us with scenes of brutality or the horrible scourge of the Nazis to make it's point, but I couldn't help feeling that there was something significant lacking in the picture. By contrast, I would point the reader in the direction of what might be the most disturbing movie I've seen regarding the fate of young Jewish children, indeed, it might be the most disturbing movie I've seen given any subject. That would be 2008's \"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\", with a decidedly emotional ending that conveys an unusual twist. On a somewhat different level, there's also 2004's \"Before the Fall\", which examines German students in a schoolroom setting as this movie does for the French, and how those chosen to become members of the Nazi elite dealt with their unconventional status.",

It is found out during the film that Jean is Jewish, and you can imagine, given that time in history, all the things that went through the boys' minds. Louis Malle has crafted a film that not only tells a good story, but is shot in intriguing colors. The story has a lot of heart and is highly recommended.",

I was able to follow along quite naturally - which for me is unusual for a foreign film.The child actors are all quite good, especially the main ones. I did find that there were quite a few crude exchanges between the boys, that I think would have been better left out. I know they were trying to portray the gutter talk that boys will resort to when left to their own devices. I think some of the boys were a little young to be participating in this. Again, perhaps this is a product of being at an all boys school with younger and older boys mixed in together in tight living quarters.I think this film is a great portrayal of friendship. I also believe it succeeds in showing us the worst in humanity, and balances it by showing us some of the best.

Basically, set during World War II, and term is beginning at a Catholic school run by priests, and upper class boy Julien Quentin (Gaspard Manesse) and his brother Fran\u00e7ois (Stanislas Carr\u00e9 De Malberg) are attending after being on vacation, and Julien reestablishes himself as the leader of the fellow students. The school sees a new student arriving, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejt\u00f6), who instantly becomes a victim to bullying by the other boys, and of course Julien does not like him for a while. As time goes by though Jean does become much more part of the gang and accepted, and he gains a friend in the leader, Julien even finds out Jean is Jewish and hiding out from the Nazis. There are a few other things happening while the boys attend their lessons and hang out together, such as assistant cook Joseph (Fran\u00e7ois N\u00e9gret) caught selling food on the black market. The big point come though when Nazis are searching the school, aware that there may be Jewish students hiding out, and in the end Jean and three others are caught and taken away, leaving Julien devastated. Also starring Francine Racette as Mme Quentin, Philippe Morier-Genoud as Father Jean, Fran\u00e7ois Berl\u00e9and as Father Michel and Peter Fitz as Muller. The cast of young actors all do pretty well, I will admit I did not understand everything going on, but it is an interesting enough story and concept from what I did follow, especially as it is semi-autobiographical based on the past of the director, I suppose it is a Second World War drama to see.

The details of dress, of horseplay, of conversation all sound quite realistic.Unfortunately for me, that didn't mean they were interesting. The movie seems almost formless - until the uninteresting climax we expected throughout. If I had found either the central character or his brother appealing, I might have a different reaction - but I don't. They are very realistically presented - and quite unlikeable. The whole movie feels very episodic - with one episode having little to do with the subsequent episode. I suppose much of life is this way - yet in a drama, I want to see something that's more shaped into a story.I kept wanting to fast forward the movie to see how much longer it would go on. Nor is the story very original -- from The Two of Us (which may have been the first French movie I ever saw) to The Angry Harvest to A Love in Germany (though that time a Polish POW instead of a Jewish civilian), we are used to The Pianist to Enemies to the Diary of Anne Frank, the hiding of Jews during W.W.II is very well-trodden ground. No subject is ever entirely plowed - and if there were some particular insight this time, I might have been more intrigued. Alas...I actually regret the reaction I had - because this movie apparently means so much to so many - but although the review stating that it felt \"lived in\" is completely true, that didn't make it interesting.

He allows us to see scenes so appalling and soaked with historical inhumanity in sequences and pictures that are stunning in their simplicity and sobriety. The pace of the movie mingled with the sensitivity of both the director's storytelling and the actors' performances make this movie a cinematic highlight and an accomplishment residing at the zenith of French film-making acquisitions.The setting is France in 1944, occupied by the German forces. A beautiful Gaspard Manesse introduces a narration reaching for sincere authenticity and emotional depth. The story focuses on the legacy of Louis Malle, who attended a private boarding school run by the clergy at the age of 12. Gaspard Manesse, being at the center and telling the story with angel-like grace and sublime sincerity, experiences the harsh time of the German occupation as he suffers from malnutrition, cold and desolation caused by bleak accommodations and continuous air raids.Then he encounters Raphael Fejt\u00f6's character, Jean Bonnet, an outcast who joins Julien (Gaspard) and the other boys in their daily struggle for viability. The evolving affection and eventual friendship that subtly accrues from their mutual bias for literature is not presented in a stereotyped and corny mode, but transformed as a growing sympathy based on events and incidents that awakened Julien's awareness of Jean's apparent strangeness in terms of religion and eating habits. He slowly discovers Jean's secret, which makes him curious and strengthens the bond of affection that was already growing between them. The tragedy at the end is thoroughly brutal in its transition on screen, thrashing in its subtlety and heart-rending in its sincerity.I was personally moved by the quality of each illustration, of the message of every detail and the power of the camera work. Gaspard Manesse tells the story masterly, conveying horror and spirituality alike with naive simplicity and touching authenticity.The movie ranges among the best ever accomplishments of French cinema. It made me think about life and values, about the truths of our existence and the brittleness of life. The story is historically true and thus a strong and pervasive witness of one boy's real experience of the horrors of war and the inequities of our daily struggles to find and defend happiness and vitality against all odds.Louis Malle died in 1995. At the end of the movie he says that despite the 40 plus years that have passed since 1944, he would never forget that moment on that cold and chilly January morning, when his friend was taken away by the Nazis. Maybe he had Jean's face in front of him when he died in California, so far away from his native soil. Maybe he reached out for the face of a boy who died in 1944, a face that accompanied him for the rest of his life and did not let go of him, defining his character and his values. It's memories that make us who we are and what we were. The movie's last line symbolises this eternal message of life in an unprecedented and subtle manner for all times.",

There are endless scenes of boys being boys in school and doing their things, which is fine for character development which eventually builds up to a heavy emotional scene at the end.

I remembered bits and pieces, but re-watching it recently as an adult, I found this movie to be a real classic.It's an incredibly unpretentious film, telling without any cinematic fireworks the story of Jean Bonnet (Kippelstein), a young Jew who has been hidden at a boarding school for wealthy Catholic boys, and befriends Julien Quentin. The friendship is portrayed very naturalistically and is charming in its realism, there's nothing profound about it, they just go from being strangers to pretty good friends in a very casual, haphazard way that strikes me as how most people made friends at that age. Much of the movie is episodic, which helps build the characters in a realistic way, and I think a lot of the film's strength is how much time it devotes to building the friendship through interesting little moments. To succeed, any character-driven movie needs to make you care about the characters, and through realism and honesty, \"Au Revoir Les Enfants\" does just that.The movie is set against a backdrop of World War 2 and occupied France, and I wonder how French people feel about this movie, it must represent a sad chapter of their history. The movie seems imbued with the gloomy, defeated attitudes that must have been prevalent in the country then, and yet there is a spark of defiance - the core characters do small things to antagonize their occupiers, and in the beautiful conclusion we of course are left with the message that although the events of the times were horrible, the human spirit had the ability to prevail.\"Au Revoir Les Enfants\" is a beautiful and tragic work of art.

I think my favorite part will always be Malle's voice at the end summing up what we already had feared...............",

For once it was one of the best films ever made technically. Today, I still regard it as a technically good film. However, Au revoir les enfants is drastically different. It challenges the usual notion of how war can impact people and especially kids.Having seen Come and See, which is however much different, it sticks to horrific effects a young person has to endure. What this film instead does is gives a glimpse of hope and empathy that viewers can share with characters and which is also visible shared between characters themselves.In terms of screenplay, there was hardly anything that was novice but its simplicity touched so many things and emotions that it looked profound in a unique way. It is a long way to watch all of Malle's films but this will stay in heart for a while.",

Well worth owning.I like the earlier review comments about this being a non-sentimental, non Hollywood treatment of real people and a very real issue.Vivre la France. Hollywood & the US have a lot to learn in my opinion about what it takes to communicate an authentically human experience in film. Louis Malle did not aim at a mass market, and clearly was not interested primarily in commercial success. There is nothing wrong with commerce, but it isn't art. I think what distinguishes a film like this (and so many french films, highbrow or lowbrow)is an ability to capture and communicate authentic experiences, immediately recognizable human experiences. To my mind this film is worth any price simply because of its depiction of two boys faces, watching a Charlie Chaplin news reel remake of the famous ship filled with Jewish refugees turned back as it tried to enter the US. The news reel pans the Statue of Liberty in NY's harbor, then the quick, jerky movements of refugees being roped off and contained. Then the two boys faces. The French boy's face is oddly blank and not quite entertained. The Jewish boy's face recognizes what he sees. Yet there is no movement, the boys are the same age, friends, in the same school. It is a haunting, irreversible moment. Why do so few of these moments exist in made-for-the-market movies?Get this one if you want to be reminded what it is not to be made for the market.",

            "content": "In 1987, Louis Malle, after a run of American produced films that worked (My Dinner With Andre, Atlantic City) and failed (Pretty Baby, Crackers), decided to return to his roots and write and produce a small budget French film, Au Revoir Les Enfants (Goodbye, Children) about a supposedly true experience he had as a child, in Vichy France, toward the end of World War Two, at a privileged French boarding school. Although Malle has always claimed the incident to be true, despite changing details of it in retellings, and dramatically for the screen, while others have claimed he was simply telling a good story, neither claim's veracity nor lack has a thing to do with whether or not the story and film work as stand alone works of art. They do, but not nearly as well as the film's greatest champions insist.The tale is rather simple- in the winter of 1943-44 (December and January) the Malle stand in character, a twelve year old boy, befriends one of four Jewish boys that a Roman Catholic headmaster allows to stay at the private school, to save their lives. Their friendship is slow but realistic in budding, but then the Gestapo comes to the school, rounds up the Jewish boys- save one who escapes, and the headmaster, Father Jean (Philippe Morier-Genoud), and the final shot is of the Malle stand-in watching his friend, and the others, being carted off to the death camps, as the school is closed, and Malle, in voice-over, reveals their fates\u0085. Overall, while Au Revoir Les Enfants is a good film, indeed, arguably a very good film, it is too straightforward, one dimensional, and not that daring, to come close to true greatness. Yet, mere excellence in a film that could be more is often more frustrating than watching a piece of garbage, because there are moments when one can say, 'If the director only did this,' 'If the screenwriter only did that,' etc. Yes, the film, like almost all Holocaust films, did well at awards time, getting two Academy Award nominations for Best Foreign Language film and Best original screenplay, it won the Golden Lion award at the 1987 Venice Film Festival, and swept up seven awards at the C\u00e9sar Awards- France's Oscars, including Best Director, Best Film and Best Writing, among other honors, but honors do not make up for the 'could'a, should'a, would'a' feeling one is left with after a film like this. And, unlike Chinese food, such leftover pangs do not demand a second helping. Thus, Malle's film is what it is, a good- but not great, meal, served at a restaurant (Holocaust art) that one should only eat at sparingly, so whatever pungency it packs stays on the tongue longer, after its real flavor has faded, and the remembered taste seems all the more delicious.",

            "content": "\"To make up for its lack of a moral compass, the public is prey to sudden gusts of kitschy sentimentality followed by vehement outrage, all encouraged by the cheap and cynical sensationalism of its press.\" \u2013 Theodore Dalrymple Louis Malle's \"Au Revoir Les Enfants\" tells the tale of a young Jewish child who is sheltered from the Nazis (and Vichy police) by a Catholic school during World War 2. The film is the spiritual sequel to Malle's earlier \"Lacombe, Lucian\" - another autobiographical tale about a boy sold out to the Nazis - but is directed with much more skill. This is the glossiest and slickest of Malle's films.The bulk of the film concerns the blossoming friendship between a young French boy and Jewish boy, and their fears of living away from their parents and home. It is along these lines that the film works best, Malle capturing the confusion, fear, vulnerability and wonder of youth. One scene, a school organised treasure hunt in the woods, is powerful.While the film thinks it is \"enlightened\" and \"liberal\", it merely offers another form of anti-Semitism. Malle depicts Jews as cute, lovable, superior and exotic, systematically reversing the sinister venalities of Nazi agitprop. Malle's camera is infatuated with young, Jewish beauty, salivating over the Jewish child and fawning over his \"talents\", \"innocence\", \"grace\" and \"allurement\". In boot-licking the Jew's preciousness, the film not only suggests that a less attractive non-Jewish child is less worthy of being spared, but partakes in the very same kind of \"objectification of humanity\" that the Nazis did, such a stance being one of the psychological mechanisms that enabled the Holocaust and continues to fuel knee-jerk anti-Semitism today.The film is shot in icy greys, whites and blues, and is structured as a series of recollections by a now adult Malle (the tale is partially autobiographical). Malle's camera coddles and sighs over the Jewish boy, and then weeps when the kid is removed, during the film's climax, from the school compound by Nazi soldiers. Interestingly, it is a poor youth who turns the Jewish boy in to the Nazis; working class resentment smoothly misdirected toward society's scapegoats.8/10 - Worth one viewing.",

            "content": "It's notable right away that this adopts a considerably flat, subdued tone compared to other titles Louis Malle has made. Other films have been darkly wry, intellectual, playful, or detached; this is stripped of even the thinnest veneer of pretense. And for good reason, of course - however dreary other tales in the filmmaker's oeuvre may get, the subject matter here is all too dire; the climactic sequence is ponderous, with enormous impact, strictly of its own accord. It's important to know this is apparently based on an experience in Malle's own youth, yet at the same time such knowledge is unnecessary, for we know this has been living history to play out again and again. It would be wrong to say 'Au revoir les enfants' is an \"enjoyable\" or pleasant watch, but that's also exactly why it's probably an outright must-see.Indeed, \"entertaining\" is an inappropriate word here, but from a fundamental standpoint of craftsmanship, this is fantastically well made in all regards. The filming locations are easy on the eyes, and those behind the scenes made fine contributions across the board, not least cinematographer Renato Berta. The cast give such natural performances, slipping gracefully into character, that it's easy to lose sight of the fact that they're just actors; given the most focus, of course Gaspard Manesse and Raphael Fejto stand out the most. And it rather goes without saying, I should think, that Malle's direction is altogether impeccable. His orchestration of every shot and scene is precise and firm, demonstrating irreproachable command of the medium, yet with a delicate touch that lets each component part manifest, breathe, and resolve organically. Greatly impressed as I've been with his direction elsewhere, this may well be the brightest gem in his crown, and that's saying so very much.Above all, there's a stunning, quiet ferocity in Malle's screenplay that imparts an air of tension even when there's otherwise no reason to feel it. From the portraiture of often boorish, brutish schoolboys in a terrible time and place there comes to flow a sickeningly jolting urgency and drama as the villains show their faces, and the tension becomes as definite and thick as classic London fog. The movie is named 'Au revoir les enfants,' with deliberate and specific reasoning, yet it could have just as fairly been named 'Adieu l'enfance,' for apart from recalling a particular episode in Malle's youth and a bleak period in history, this also portrays the loss of innocence is the most grim of ways. The characters are achingly real and believable (as they should be, under the circumstances), not least Julien's unknowing curiosity, and the dialogue as well. Each subsequent scene to present, from the crassness of school-age children, to the slow development of new friendship, to the sudden, harrowing sequence of events in the last stretch, are all penned with utmost care and attentiveness as the narrative smoothly rolls forward. And once more, that fluid, unassuming progression only serves to amplify the blows to come.While to date I've not yet seen all of Malle's features, I've come to expect nothing but the very best from him, and this is only further illustration of why. He shows a mastery of his craft - intelligence, mindfulness, and creativity - that even some of the most internationally famous and celebrated filmmakers cannot claim. From one title to the next one never knows just what he is going to do next, and each instance goes well beyond what any basic premise may portend. As if it were possible 'Au revoir les enfants' hits even harder than his other works, at the same time that it arguably carries itself with more finesse. I can appreciate that this won't appeal to all, but for both the overall quality and the nature of the saga on hand, as far as I'm concerned it's essential, and very much worth seeking out to watch.",

The film primarily focuses on the relationship that develops between protagonist Francois Quentin and a new student Jean Bonnet (actually a Jewish boy whose real name is Kippelstein). Previous to Bonnet's arrival, Quentin was the class leader, both academically and influentially outside of class; now the new upstart Bonnet appears to be Quentin's academic and artistic superior.

Cinematically Malle was never considered truly part of the nouvelle vague directors because of his classical traits, but not exactly a truly 'old vague' director, thus establishing a sort of balance between both fields. The actors, the music, the direction, the story, all will stay forever in our hearts.

            "content": "French movies are almost always too slow and boring for American audience tastes. While cinematography is important, French movies are often criticized for their overindulgence in angles without dialog. Finish a French movie and ask yourself, \"What did I just watch?\" Often times, the only redeeming part of French movies are the actors and actresses who are more than willing to remove their clothes for the audiences.So how can a 20-year-old Au Revoir Les Enfants keep contemporary American attention? With an amazing script, realistic portrayals of childhood, different perspectives on world history and viewer created tension waiting for heartache as it looms on the horizon.The story follows Julien Quentin (Gaspard Manesse) leaving Paris after Christmas Break to return to his Catholic boarding school. A new student, Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejt\u00f6) joins his class and quickly demonstrates modest intellectual superiority over arrogant Quentin. Refusing to adopt a formulaic childhood movie friendship (animosity, followed by one person helping the other and then a flowering and transcendental relationship), Quentin and Bonnet seesaw between appreciation and apprehension. True to life, there is no single event that cements their friendship and instead several experiences grow the two closer together.The setting takes place in occupied France during World War II, which is a situation ideal for exploring the sheer range of human experience: trust and betrayal, love and hate, fear and courage, hope and hopelessness. However, the film doesn't try to do overextend itself and simply concentrates on the children. In fact, most of the situations that occur are not understood by Quentin. While he's sitting in class and the camera shows a German soldier asking to confess outside the window, he doesn't even look up from his school work. Then when his math class continues underground after an air raid siren, he nonchalantly ignores the teacher's lesson and reads a different book. When the lights flicker, the children act excited; when the teacher starts praying, the children follow out of habit instead of fear. Even though the audience has evidence the story occurs sometime during the occupation, the only way we can identify the precise year is near the end when the math instructor mentions the start of a Soviet offensive. And since that signals somewhere around six months before Paris is liberated, the hope for a happy ending looms somewhere in the future.The film proceeds somewhat direction less for a long time. This allows tension to flow from the audiences expectations that something should happen soon, although we're not sure what or how. We mostly watch boys enjoying a sheltered life, oblivious to the dire state of world affairs. The voice over at the end is especially memorable because the free-flowing story has no buildup to a climax and we only recognize that we witnessed the climax when the voice over starts. As the German officer continues calling names, we are led to believe the movie has led us to the names called. But it doesn't \u2013 the events are mostly over.While it can be tedious watching a French movie tiptoe from one isolated incident to another, Au Revoir Les Enfants is absolutely amazing. Seeing children in movies that behave like children (naturally we're not surprised when students relentlessly harass the new kid) authenticates the experience of the characters far beyond the less believable golden heart child befriends new kid and receives rewards for their kindness. Witnessing world history from different eyes will hopefully serve enough interest to consider watching this movie yourself. - Erik Hagen",

            "content": "Louis Malle is an interesting director. He never gained a huge following, and his best known movie is probably My Dinner with Andre (which I actually have never seen), but everything he made is eminently watchable. The most recent movie of his that I was exposed to was Vanya on 42nd Street, a performance of Chekov's Uncle Vanya presented as a rehearsal in a dilapidated theater. That film did more to enhance my opinion about the importance of actors than any other movie I've ever seen.ChildhoodAu Revoir Les Enfants is deceptively simple. It's the story of two boys in a Catholic boarding school outside of Paris during World War II. The main character, Julien, like the rest of the boys at the school, is the son of wealthy parents. Like most eleven year old boys, he has little understanding of the world outside his childish concerns. At one point he asks his older brother, who also goes to the same school, what a Yid is.Fran\u00e7ois Quentin: A jew.\nJulien Quentin: I know, but what exactly is a Jew?\nFran\u00e7ois Quentin: Someone who doesn't eat pork.\nJulien Quentin: Are you kidding me?\nFran\u00e7ois Quentin: Not at all.\nJulien Quentin: What have people got against them?\nFran\u00e7ois Quentin: The fact they're smarter than us, and they crucified Jesus.\nJulien Quentin: That's not true. It was the Romans. Is that why they have to wear yellow stars?This lack of understanding of the greater world around him mostly seems to confuse little Julien. As far as he knows, he's never met a Jew, but he does see them from time to time. There's an old man in a restaurant who gets threatened by Vichy French militia. There's a younger Jew who walks out of the public bath (which Jews are barred from entering in the first place).This inability to grasp the implications of anti-Semitism is made all the more potent with the addition of a new boy to the school: Jean Bonnett. He's obviously not like the other kids. He doesn't pray the Hail Mary with everyone else. He doesn't take communion. He doesn't even take Greek (because of his knowledge of Latin). Jean doesn't really notice Julien, he's just another one of the boys that picks on him for his last name (\"Easter Bonnet\" they call him), but the two begin a relationship that steadily grows as the film progresses.Slice of LifeThe relationship that develops between Julien and Jean feels shockingly real to me. It doesn't have a linear path. Instead, it ebbs and flows between moments and events that they both enjoy and small fights that erupt between them. With each moment they share, the two grow closer in the way that boys who fight often do.Whenever I hear actors talk about finding truth in their performances, I tend to roll my eyes. I find it pretentious talk, but I'm going to engage in some of that very same stuff now.Everything about this movie feels so very true, starting with the two boys themselves. Acting very understatedly and believably by two young performers (Gaspard Manesse and Raphael Fejto) who almost never acted again, everything the two do and say feels genuine. The reading at night, the insults they hurl at each other, the way they avoid hiding away during an air raid just to play on a piano without any real rhyme or reason. All of it feels completely natural and believable. That believability about every little thing in the actors' performances really sells the reality of the movie as a whole.That believability doesn't end with just the performances. The movie was made in a small boarding school called the Institution Sainte-Croix outside of Paris. It was filmed entirely in winter so that when the boys complain of cold, it very well could be because they were actually really cold.The Real WorldI talked before about Julien's inability to understand the world around him. That attitude is very much not reflected in Jean, for Jean's secret is that he's a Jew on the run.The priests and teachers of the school have taken in three Jewish boys in an effort to hide them from the authorities. Julien has trouble connecting with people easily partially because he's so terrified that an errant word on his part, or on the part of another boy, could give away not only himself but the two others.There's a great moment in the latter half of the movie that highlights the difference in how Julien and Jean approach the world. All of the boys in the school have been sent out as two separate team to find a treasure. Julien gets separated from his team but finds the treasure on his own. Alone with night approaching, he looks around and finds Jean nearby.Julien Quentin: I found the treasure. All by myself.\nJean Bonnett: Are there wolves in these woods?Julien's mind is on play. Jean's is on the danger that surrounds him at all times.How does Julien combine his innocence of the world with Jean's fear that never goes away (\"You scared?\" Julien asks, \"All the time,\" Jean replies)? He can't quite do it. He's no mature enough to understand. Through circumstance, Julien discovers that Jean's real last name is not Bonnett but Kippelstein, and in a fit of momentary rage threatens to tell everyone Jean's real last name. He has no idea of the implications of what that would entail.One Winter MorningThere's a subplot in the film about a cook's assistant who trades with the boys for their foods that their parents send them from home. Julien's mother gives him jam, so Julien trades with the cook's assistant for little things here and there in exchange.When the head of the school finds out that the cook's assistant not only was trading with the boys, but was helping to supply the black market from the school's kitchens, he's furious and fires the assistant. The assistant (Joseph) finds the act unjust, especially since the cook herself, according to him, did it just as much as he did, if not more. With nowhere to turn, Joseph turns informant based on the obvious suspicions around the three new boys (who never ate pork).The Gestapo shows up, knowing the real names of the three boys and saying that they had been looking for them for some time. As the chief officer is busy angrily tearing small USSR and USA flags out of a map, Julien quickly looks back to Jean. The Gestapo officer noticed the action out of the corner of his eye and simply walks over the Jean until Jean packs up his things and follows the Gestapo officer out.Other things play out for some time involving the teachers and the other two boys until the final moments of the film:With some attention and familiarity with French, you can hear the title of the movie spoken by the priest as he leaves. But the key is the final voiceover spoken by the film's director, Louis Malle.Bonnet, Negus and Dupre died at Auschwitz; Father Jean at Mauthausen. The school reopened its doors in October. More than 40 years have passed, but I'll remember every second of that January morning until the day I die.The impressive emotional impact of the film itself combined with the fact that it's autobiographical to the film's director.This film is so small in scope but affects me so intently that I treasure the fact that I saw it right around the period that I was originally developing my top ten years back.",

While browsing the internet, I found the NYT article dated 2/7/88 and titled \"Malle Confronts Haunting Memory\" which was written by Richard Bernstein. This NYT article examined the interesting facts surrounding director Louis Malle's school experiences at Petit College d'Avon. It also revealed the historical facts and names behind the real life characters who are depicted as Jean Bonnet, Negus, Jacques Dupre, and Pere Jean in the Au Revoir Les Enfants movie. About 43 or 44 years later,director Louis Malle found the courage to write and share his gamut of profound emotions on the silver screen about his experiences with his beloved former Petit College d'Avon colleagues and French school headmaster who still tugged indefinitely at his heart strings despite the passage of time.",

            "content": "ARLE is another masterpiece by French director Louis Malle (his other great movies are Lacombe Lucien and Elevator to the Gallows); it's about the troubled friendship of two boys -Jean and Julien- who live in a boarding school during the Nazi occupation of France (c. 1940-44). Julien (as most of the boys in the school) is a Catholic, and Jean is Jewish, as Julien and the rest of the kids later find out. Julien is Jean's only friend at school, and their friendship is based in an (almost) silent complicity and mutual interests (they read the same books, enjoy playing the piano, etc). In the middle of the film, they get lost in a forest during a trip; this scene is wonderful because almost no words are used, their emotions are shown through their eyes and facial expressions. In the last scene, Louis Malle reminds us that sometimes, when we are very young, we make mistakes that we later regret the rest of our lives. But Julien wasn't a traitor, he simply made a foolish error or acted unconsciously, without willing to harm Jean or risk his life. And Jean was right: \"Sooner or later, they would have caught me\", he told Julien, who would be haunted by the memories of that day until his death.",

            "content": "In my opinion the best war films are films away from the battle field. Examples of these are \"The best years of our lives\" (1946, William Wyler) or (partially) \"The deer hunter\" (1978, Michael Cimino).\"Au revoir les enfants\" is more a boarding school movie than a war movie. During the film we notice the war mostly because of the regular visits to the bombshleter and because an expensive restaurant can only serve a couple of dishes from the menu card. When the war finally shows its ugly face at the end of the movie the shock is all the greater.Boarding school movies are about friendships and \"Au revoir les enfants\" is no exception. Central to the film is the friendship between Julien Quentin (Gaspard Manesse) and Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejto), both 12 years. By the way the great divide that we often see in American movies between the 12 year olds and the 18 year olds (for example \"Stand by me\", 1986, Rob Reiner) is non existing in the boarding school of \"Au revoir les enfants\" , maybe because some of the members of these age categories are brothers.The friendship between Julien et Jean goes through several stages. At the first stage Julien doesn't know that Jean is Jewish, something the spectator guesses almost immediately. After a while, combining a few pecularities, Julien discovers the truth about Jean. From a conversation with his older brother we learn however that he understands nothing of antisemitism. This being the case he doesn't realise how dangerous his new knowledge is. At the end of the movie this results in one careless glance with fatal consequences.How much the careless glance contributed to the fatal consequences is still open to debate however, because there is also the betrayal of the kitchen assistent Joseph (Francois N\u00e9gret). This is an interesting character because he is closely related to the character of Lucien out of \"Lacombe Lucien\" (1974, Louis Malle). The betrayal of Joseph is much easier to understand though as it is motivated by some class justice within the boarding school. Both Joseph and some pupils are involved in black market transactions, the disabled Joseph is fired while the pupils (from wealthy families, as all the pupils of this boarding school are) only get a mild warning. From this episode it turns out that the brothers of the boarding school are good people, but not perfect. Just like many other characters in \"Au revoir les enfants\".Although open to debate how much the careless glance contributed to the fatal consequences, it did contribute a lot to the sense of guilt of Julien. In the ending scene Julien is watching at an empty space. A space where he last saw his friend Jean. Then the camera cuts to a close up (nearly freeze frame) of the face of Julien. We hear an older voice saying: \"... More than 40 years have passed, but I'll remember every second of that January morning until the day I die.\".Julien = Louis Malle, and the sense of guilt of the main character is the sense of guilt of the director himself. With \"The 400 blows\" (1959) Francois Truffaut told his autobiography early in his career. Malle waited until he had fully mastered his craft, because the story meant so much to him. He finally told it in a brilliant way.",

He asks this because of his part in his friends death, 'was this my fault because of my glance is what he asks'. The answer is a resounding, 'no'.  The fault was far bigger than his action.Carrying this forward which I am sure is what Louis wants us to do he is saying to each of us, 'find ways to look deep ... the problems you are facing are not because you are bad ... we have much to do, much to do, much to do as we become better humans.'Thank you Louis Malle wherever you are.",

It's sad, and the whole spectrum is sad.Saying that, and knowing I have empathy towards all those affected by the holocaust and how tragic it was. But this movie was not at all what I thought it would be. Coming in expecting a heart-tear-wrenching movie that would make me sad, happy, and emotional. But besides the idea of this being a true story, no, It did nothing for me. The directing was clich\u00e9 for this type of movie, but I was expecting that. But I had no idea that the film would be so, so, out of the ordinary in character development as well as plot movement. The characters don't do much \"developing\" till half way till the movie is over. Hell, the two main characters who are supposed to be friend, don't even become apprentices till late in the movie.There is not much to say about the movie and the production efforts because they were predictable. But the story, could've been told so much better. Maybe I am just that really awful and cruel guy who can't appreciate the movie for what it is because I thought the story should've been more dramatized but hey, I'm a child of the 21st century. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate it, but I can't say I relatively \"Liked\" it.SilverRating: 5/10",

It is regarding the treatment of Jews during the Nazi occupation of France, so I would appreciate any input from French or Jewish readers or World War II buffs especially cognizant of that era. After 4 years of Nazi occupation and the pro-Nazi Vichy government under Petain, who gave free reign to the Gestapo to do whatever they pleased, wasn't it pretty obvious to the remaining Jews that they had to hide to survive? Why would that elderly Jewish man be sitting there in broad daylight in a public restaurant frequented by Nazis? And why wouldn't the priest have warned the Jewish child not to go into the town much less go to a public restaurant? In another film about that period, Francois Truffant's \"The Last Metro\", Catherine Deneueve's character Marion Steiner hides her Jewish husband Lucas Steiner in the cellar below her Paris theater to prevent him from being arrested by the Gestapo and sent to a concentration camp and certain death. That movie was set in 1942, two years before \"Au Revoir Les Infants\". Which is accurate?",

It may have been the very first French film I saw ... I can't think of an earlier one. It was a revelation.I've seen it several times since then, and it's always somewhat of a revelation. Films this rich usually are no matter how many times you see them. It's one of the best films ever made about childhood, specifically boys. It really immerses you in the rhythms of life in the Catholic boarding school where it's set and draws vivid characters, none of whom are simple stereotypes.It's set during WWII, and the school takes in three new students mid-year. Our protagonist gradually learns that they are Jews that the school is hiding from the Nazis, and he develops a very close relationship with one. Anyone watching this film knows where it's going, but it never travels a straight line towards the inevitable conclusion.I think it's a masterpiece. It's not populated by good guys and bad guys. Some people do very good things, some very bad. The people who do bad things do them out of fear, selfishness or, in some cases, commitment to ideology. The richness of human motives is here, and it really illustrates how little it can take to irrevocably change lives.",
