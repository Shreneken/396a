            "content": "When I was a child I watched some very bad movies; some were so bad, they made Cool as Ice look like the original Rebel Without a Cause. I'm talking about grade-A quality garbage, here.Mac and Me was a film I frequently watched \u0096 an embarrassing, agonizing, shameless marketing scheme fueled by McDonalds featuring a plot ripped off of E.T. And I ate it all up \u0096 I used to love this movie.Watching it now is like a slap in the face. Wow, it's that bad. When I was younger I didn't notice the numerous references to Mickey D's and Coca-Cola \u0096 I just marveled at the sight of strange alien beings whistling to music that played only in my head. I considered Mac and Me to be the pinnacle of film-making. Or perhaps I'm discrediting myself \u0096 I wasn't that stupid, but I was na\u00efve enough to believe, at least, that it was a fun movie, and unlike anything I had ever seen before.Well, at least one opinion remains -- it is unlike anything I've ever seen before \u0096 a rip-off so bad beyond words that it's almost as unbelievably awful as another shameless E.T. knock-off, Pod People, my choice for the worst film of all-time \u0096 and another 'so-bad-it's-good' gem that is actually so bad it becomes good, then bad again, where it continues in this cycle until it becomes downright petrifying.The film's protagonist is wheelchair-bound Michael (Jonathan Ward), an adolescent who moves to a new city and finds himself meeting up with a strange puppet \u0096 err, alien \u0096 named 'Mac' (I guess?), who waddles around like E.T. and is searching for his parents, who were picked up by a NASA space probe and are now out in California doing who-knows-what. Apparently they're not too eager to find their son since they spend the duration of the movie crawling at a snail's pace under the glare of the sun, stopping every now and again to emit sounds similar to that of a drunken elephant, making patterns in the air with their extended index fingers (now, where have I seen that in an alien-oriented movie before?).I could write an entire book on the faults of Mac and Me. To fit them into a single article almost seems ridiculous.Primarily it's just plain dumb, although it is also a horrendous mess from a technical standpoint. Its plot resembles that of RoboCop3 \u0096 sloppy and vague. Direction is equal to that of a standard TV commercial, only one of the more boring sorts. The acting also compares to a television commercial, only in ads the people aren't always expected to actually say anything other than stare at the camera and smile like they're enjoying whatever product is being pushed. Some of that applies to Mac and Me since it is such a commercial, buy-this-product-after-you're-done-watching-the-movie sort of experience \u0096 unfortunately there is the odd moment where the movie doesn't focus on its bizarre alien creatures or Coca-Cola or Ronald McDonald or brand wheelchairs or space exploration companies and demands its so-called 'actors' speak their lines. I'd rather be stuck having to watch fake prosthetic extra-terrestrials quack and make weird noises than suffer through one more 'actor's' attempt at bringing life to the project. My guess is most of the cast were hired from a nearby McDonald's restaurant \u0096 seeing how McDonald's funded, promoted, and endorsed this movie, as well as the fact that their company logo is shown from beginning to end. It's about one hundredth as fun as those BMW commercials with 'The Driver,' and one thousandth as subtle.The dialogue is classic stuff. Conversations usually consist of at least one marketing plug, sometimes more. Here's an example of some great screen writing:Michael: Gee Mac, I don't know where your parents are. It's tough being in a wheelchair. I'm still adapting to this new home. By the way, in case you didn't get it by now, I don't have any friends except you! Where are your parents, Mac?Mac: Blurp! Beep! Weeeooop!Michael: Oh darn.Annoying Brother Ripped Off of the Brother from E.T.: Gee, how the darn are we gonna get Mac to his parents?Michael: I don't know. Let's go discuss it over a two-dollar quarter pounder with cheese at McDonald's. First one there's a Coca-Cola! By the way I heard that McDonald's is the number-one food chain in America with over one million restaurants nationwide! That's a whole lotta greatness! Hey look, it's a Krispy Kreme truck \u0096 I wonder if the driver, Mr. Shack, is still selling radios.Granted, that conversation doesn't appear in the film \u0096 because it's too good. What I just wrote would qualify for a an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay after being compared to 'Mac and Me.'Then there's the most memorable and infamous scene, which is when Mac is left home alone during a school day, and 'accidentally' throws a huge orgy with all the eager NASA scientists. Wait a minute, wrong movie. The best (or worst) part of Mac and Me actually takes place at McDonald's (!). It begins as a birthday party, becomes a dance competition, and ends as a frantic showdown between Ronald McDonald and a bunch of football players (?!) and, of course, Mac, doing flips through the air dressed as some sort of animal (another '?!'). Don't ask, because I don't think there's an answer, other than this: $$$The movie is one huge conglomerate of '80s conglomerations, if that makes any sense. What a wonderful film! (Not.) If you can put up with the wooden acting, bizarre (often downright confusing) screenplay, annoying stereotypical characters, and merchandising plugs\u0085then you really are a sad pathetic waste of space and are exactly the type of candidate they're looking for to pen 'Mac and Me II: The Quest for More Money.' (I had to fit a Mel Brooks reference in there somewhere. After all, he paid me to. And I think that's the entire approach to 'Mac and Me.')",

            "content": "Okay, I'm going to assume the makers of this film knew they were making a cheap knock-off of the infinitely better E.T., and anyone who does not agree with me on this should have their brains examined. Look at the facts people! The plot is essentially the same: Weird looking alien gets separated from family and happens upon a family where the kids take him in. Then there's the fact that the dad in the family is gone (dead? divorcee? the movie never explains), and that the older brother is named MICHAEL! We get a cute little girl to play the Drew Barrymore character, there are government agents trying to find the alien, but in the end the finale is totally different (albeit ridiculous, but more on that later). But, to give the film credit, it is hilarious. I loved how the Mom assumed her handicapped, wheelchair-bound son Eric had somehow dragged plants into the house. And we can't forget the grossly obvious product placement (apparently the aliens drink Coke on their planet), the insanely ugly main character MAC (a name which is never actually used in the film I think), and a very 1980's dance contest in the middle of McDonald's. Getting back to the aliens: who the heck came up with their design? They are INSANELY unappealing and ugly. Granted, E.T. wasn't exactly beautiful, but he's Carmen Electra compared to the silly putty potato sack that is MAC. Oh, and I couldn't help but study the scene where the aliens first break out of the NASA satellite since it is so similar to the scene in Independece Day. Think about it: the government agents are peering through the glass window, trying to get a good look at what is making the scientists freak out through a haze of smoke, when the alien jumps out at them. It's weird, let me tell ya. And I swear, if I had heard Michael screech, \"They're not gonna hurt anyone!\" ONE MORE TIME...rrr. Just what made these aliens so innocent, anyway? Their electrical powers destory everything in their path, and they blow up a supermarket! Sure, they brought Eric back to life after they BLEW UP THE SUPERMARKET, but you would think someone else died in that explosion (which you really have to see to believe). Other great moments?* Three bad '80s tunes in the span of 15 minutes. * The fact that none of the scenes had anything to do with the rest of the film. For example: MAC somehow hijacks a toy truck and gets chased by dogs. Another example: The hilarious scene where Eric's wheelchair goes out of control and flies down a ravine (!!!!!), leading his Mom to think he's suicidal (actual dialogue: Why would he do something like this???\"). * Gigantic boom box and break dancers! YES! * The final scene, which defies comprehension.I can best compare this movie to Teen Witch, another ridiculous 80's family film. Although I would have to say that Mac and Me is the more insane feature. 4/4 for hilarity, 1/4 for quality.",

            "content": "Don't let that 8 rating fool you; \"Mac and Me\" is an awful movie. A blatant (nay, shameless) ripoff of \"E.T.\" - right down to the broken home and identical neighborhood - it's hard to believe such crap was earnestly marketed to kids. But viewed in the right context (with friends, beer flowing), this movie makes for a night of comic hilarity. It's not just the terrible product placement (Coca-Cola, Skittles and Valvoline are all in your face . . . also there's the random dance party at McDonald's that grinds the movie to a halt), but the low-rent makeup effects on the aliens, who have only one facial expression: surprise! Add to that the really bad white family we have to side with, the token bad-guy Feds, and the quality of acting that's just a shade above \"Troll 2\" that make \"Mac and Me\" so unbelievably shoddy. It's just not a movie you can take seriously. So I can't give this flick a bad rating because I had way too many mean-spirited laughs during the entire ride. That dummy going off the cliff in the wheelchair (in a serious drama moment . . . that's what you can expect here) is priceless. And what blows my mind is that the guy who directed this movie also wrote it! You have to believe in this nonsense pretty hard to put that much work into it. I'm not sure there's a better example of something so bad that it comes out the other end smelling of ironic roses.8/10",

            "content": "\"Mac and Me\" was one of the more infamous box office duds of its time. While this would dissuade normal folks from watching it, bad movie buffs like me naturally gravitate to it because it is such a legendary flop. The biggest reason it failed--the public quickly saw it for what it really was--a blatant rip-off of \"E.T.\". And, this time even MORE corporate references are thrown in the viewer's face...with McDonald's and Coke references galore!! Instead of Reese's Pieces, they feed this god-awful corporate shill Skittles! And, to revive Mac's family who are on the edge of death, they feed them Coke!!!The film begins with an incredibly ugly family of aliens mysteriously getting sucked into a US space probe. They are then deposited on Earth and their baby, Mac, is lost and must find its way home. In the process it meets a nice disabled kid and makes his life complete. But, when it's no longer safe, he and Elliot, I mean Eric, go on a cross- country race to find his parents and get him home--and evade capture. And to do this, they dress him up in a Halloween-type costume! Need I continue?!So is the film any good? Well, if \"ET\" had never been made, sure it would have been reasonably entertaining to very young kids who didn't notice that the film was a giant commercial and who wouldn't notice the bad dialog and abounding clich\u00e9s. But \"ET\" HAD BEEN ALREADY MADE several years earlier...so the film has zip when it comes to originality. You wonder how the folks associated with the film felt--they must have been really embarrassed at how blatant this was. And, at just about every turn it seems to do it worse than \"ET\"...and often MUCH worse. It's a vacuous, soul-sucking corporate mess of a film in so many ways.When I saw this film tonight, it was decades after its original release and I was startled how ugly and expressionless Mac was. However, I had to remind myself that ET also looks pretty crappy when you see him today because we are used to much better special effects in 2015--though Mac is definitely crappier. The worst is when the dead, expressionless doll is riding on Eric's lap during the big chase! As for the outer space scene, however, I watched it on a very big screen TV and I was surprised because it looked so nice. This space scene along with actually hiring a disabled kid to play a disabled kid are about the only things that impressed me about the film. Otherwise, a pointless rip-off from start to finish---and not even bad enough to make bad movie buffs laugh. But enough overt corporate references to make this a GREAT film to use as a drinking game--taking a shot every time you saw these blatant ads! Believe me, you would get stinking drunk if you tried this!!By the way, the kid calls the hideous little alien 'Mac'--an acronym for Mysterious Alien Creature. In no way was this meant to be like 'ET' for the Extra-Terrestrial....yeah, right! Also, perhaps it's just me, but this might just be the most whitebread, corporate and uncool film ever made--especially during the god-awful McDonald's dance scene.",

If the Special Olympics were as hilarious as when wheelchair-bound Eric rolled uncontrollably down a hill, off a cliff and into a body of water, I'd be someone's sponsor just so I can see it for myself in person.3. No, no, McDonald's. The line \"Why don't you stop by for a Big Mac?\" was completely subtle.4. As were: \"You know what I feel like?\" \u2013 \"A Big Mac?\"5. Nice touch on the Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter overtones in the score\u0085despite being a kid's movie.6. Jennifer Anniston's acting debut was Mac and Me. Later, she starred in Marley & Me. Is Murdering Me coming soon?7. It shouldn't have taken two times for Mac to be sucked hard for us to get the hint the writers were trying to tell us something.8. I usually try to avoid spoiling movies, but\u0085 E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. There you go.9. Mac gets stuck in a tree, dogs threaten to rip him apart and they cue the heart-felt music. I haven't laughed that hard since wheelchair-bound Eric plunged 50 feet into the water.10. Ironically, it does take a lot of coke to enjoy a feature like this.11. Code name: \"One Hundred X-Ray?\" Really?12. I waited the whole movie for the dance party inside and out of McDonald's and it was so worth it. Everyone was having a blast and I want my next birthday party there, too!13. Sometimes Mac can fly and sometimes he can control electrical objects, but when running from the suits, Mac chooses to ride on Eric's lap down another hill in his speeding wheelchair. ?? 14. Oh, and try not to be in tears from laughter after that chase scene's over.15. Skittles? Seriously? Stop.16. \"How long have you been in lingerie?\" might not be the best question to ask the most blatantly obvious sex offender working at Sears.17. There were more discounts in this movie than on McDonald's value menu. Like Discount Drew Barrymore, Discount Dee Wallace, Discount Henry Thomas\u0085.18. I'm probably taking the lines \"I sucked him up\u0085and then we blew him\" way out of context.19. Traveling billions of miles for a three-minute rock collecting experiment might sound like a waste of NASA's talent and money.20. And how they missed the straws the aliens used for mud slurping should get at least one of them fired.21. But, the genius of getting the spacecraft across the galaxy in less time than it takes the Enterprise, would probably get someone a raise.22. Maybe Joe Arpaio saw this movie and that's why he is the way he is.23. The end taught me three things: Ronald McDonald is a real person, aliens can reanimate life but not fix dead legs and the MacFamily will be back. Or\u0085so they promised before anyone actually saw this.24. The moral of the story is simple: You better be rooting for either the Chicago Bears (on WGN) or the Chicago Cubs while having a Coke. Only the weird neighbor roots for the Dodgers, but he probably eats at Burger King, anyways.",

The fact that it rips-off \"E.T.\" in almost every plot-point is bad enough; but did the filmmakers HAVE to turn the basic idea into a giant plug for a well-known burger franchise? Anyone who can't see the exploitation for what it is must be obtuse to the point of imbecility.The little alien is badly designed. It's incredibly ugly, and the only time when the aliens stand-out favorably is when they do their haunting whistling. Otherwise, forget it.The lead in this, Jade Calegory, deserves some praise. He never let his own real-life disability slow him down and he's actually a pretty accomplished actor. It's a shame that he had to be in this. If he ever had hopes of an acting career, it was effectively MURDERED by his appearance here. It had to be embarrassing for him, unless he's got thicker skin than I give him credit for.I do, however, have one wish: if anyone who is reading this can make it happen, PLEASE put this out on Region 1 DVD, at least!

But this poorly done film made its way onto one of my cable movie channels last night, and I feel the need to have a violent, outward reaction outside of the projectile vomiting I experienced.People, this film is bad. Really bad. Bad like \"Showgirls\" bad, where it's so bad, it's both insulting and laughable simultaneously. And forgive me, but anybody who finds this 95-minute commercial for McDonalds and Coca-Cola to be warm-hearted or well done in any way knows not a thing about what makes a movie good, and needs a great deal of emotional counseling.First, let's reiterate that point about this being an extended commercial. Folks, it is. The product placement in this film is shameless.\nNext, there are basic things that make a film \"good,\" like strong acting, a well-written script, superior camerawork or quality special effects. \"Mac and Me\" has none of these. Wooden posts would have made for better actors. The script clunks and thuds with every ridiculous, uninspired line. And the alien creatures of the film, with their bug-eyes and protruding bellies, look about a life-like as melted candles.I also have to make a point of just how much of a rip-off of \"E.T.\" this film was. Not only is the plot just a poor carbon copy, but even the title of this attrocity becomes an act of thievery when it's revealed that \"Mac\" stands for \"Mysterious Alien Creature.\" I'm not even the biggest fan of uber-cutesy \"E.T.\" either, but at least there the attempts at manipulation are somewhat subtle. Here, the filmmakers fell just short of subtitles at the bottom of the screen that said \"LAUGH HERE\" and/or \"CRY NOW.\"And the cherry atop Stewart Rafill's bile sundae?  The scene inside a McDonald's (Our aforementioned sponsor) when normal, everyday patrons suddenly and spontaneously spring to life into a choreographed dance sequence.  Yeh, that happens at the Greasy Mac's on Route 1 near my house every freakin' day.Saps only will buy into laughable hunk of junk... for the rest of you out there, I recommend this movie only if you're looking for new additions to your Ten Worst List.",

I have just encountered a movie so bad even as an ET rip-off, but I've also heard from Wikipedia.org that this was made to promote McDonalds to kids.

The dialog is terrible, the direction is messy and unfocused and the pacing is too sluggish for itself. The acting is not only over-the-top, but completely wooden with the exception of Jade Calegory for his emotional performance as the main lead. Even the script is lifeless with moments that are completely unfunny and lacks some wit, charm, and heart to it. The second saving grace, much like Jade Calegory's performance, goes to the music from Alan Silvestri. Not exactly his best score, but still pretty good.Overall, Mac and Me isn't exactly the worst movie I've seen, but it's still a horrible film that needs to be avoided.

            "content": "As is to be expected, in the wake of the very successful E.T., some massively derivative imitators were released. In '86 Flight of the Navigator used Paul Reubens' Pee-wee Herman voice as that of an alien ship which befriends a boy who just wants to get home. To be sure that was a smarmy, 2nd-hand effort. But by far, the other much worse product came with 1988's \"Mac and Me.\" This was so much more appalling, that \"Navigator\" was instantly blown out of everyone's collective memory. Mac and Me is so heinous that it could melt the brains of the unborn.Remarkably, the movie is so burdened by wall-to-wall garbazh, that stealing the entire plot of another movie could be the least of it's problems.An unrelated movie, called \"East Side Story,\" came out in 1997. It's a sort of \"That's Entertainment!\" of Soviet era propagandistic musical numbers on topics as naff as productivity objectives, living in a workers paradise, ideological purity, etc.. Mmmm... delicious! That's what you get when the machinery of state has no natural competitors. But \"Mac and Me\" is what capitalism would be bringing you morning, noon and night if powerful fans of ca$h never had their avarice checked by people who know better; critics and people with taste. As one cynical remark goes: If Thomas Edison had an MBA he would have just kept making larger candles. This speed-course in half-assed, capitalist film-making includes, as noted, a plot lifted intact from a more successful movie (Why reinvent the wheel?), takes the form of a 90 minute McDonalds commercial (You want to lose 90 minutes of selling time?), interrupted by Coke commercials, has an alien that looks like a 4 dollar rubber fetus (because it is a 4 dollar rubber fetus), a (sym)pathetic hero in a wheelchair, and a script produced after sniffing the finest glue one could buy at the 99 cent store. Did $omebody $ay MAC-Donald$?Somehow the execs didn't imagine we'd notice the endless shilling, maybe 200 percent more than in a typical movie, while taking their express-elevator ride to profit hell. So let's acknowledge these brave geniuses, who strived to make capitalism safe for uh... more capitalism, by name so they make it into the history books; Producers Mark Damon, William B. Kerr, and R.J. Louis; AND so this review is inescapably linked to their names in internet search results.Of course there are questions that capitalism does't answer. Why do the aliens heads look like human scrotums? Why do they walk like babies with a load in their diapers? Why do they like whistling the first few notes of \"Happy Trails (to you)?\"This is the lowest point in movie history, in any country, ever. Whoever would try to displace this as the \"Worst Movie Ever Made\" must first use it as a checklist to make sure their movie fails as spectacularly in as many places.",

            "content": "Mac and Me has a reputation as one of the most infamous movies Hollywood has ever produced- and with good reason. It is utter dreck, a shameless rip-off of ET and an extended exercise in gratuitous product placement. The only original ideas it has are utterly insane. And the alien costumes are sure to give kids nightmares.The amazing thing is that for the most part this movie is not poorly made, at least from a technical standpoint. The acting is completely fine, even good by the standards of a children's movie. The directing and editing are perfectly competent. The photography is quite nice, with many good panning and aerial shots of the desert surroundings. There are some well-staged car chases and crashes that obviously required experienced stunt coordinators, and a number of entirely convincing explosions. This is clearly a movie made by professionals who knew what they were doing and had a decent budget to work with.Which makes it all the stranger that the alien costumes are so horrifyingly bad. Or that this movie turned out so awful. Or maybe not so strange when you consider the script they were working with. From its inception, no-one was under the illusion that Mac & Me was anything but a blatant rip off. The little alien being stranded on Earth, befriending a young child, revealing his magical powers, and the pursuit by frightening government agents in black suits; all directly copied from Spielberg. They also manage to shoehorn in scenes lifted from Poltergeist, and a plucky sidekick who looks and sounds suspiciously like Punky Brewster.And the entire time the product placement is blatantly front and center, until the whole project feels more like a series of advertisements than an actual movie. ET saw the alien take Reese's Pieces from a child's hand. In Mac and Me they pass packages of Skittles to each other. And drink Cokes nonstop. Seriously, several major plot points - including what can only be described as a resurrection- are driven by the aliens' overpowering need to acquire more Coca Cola.And in one of cinema's most infamous scenes, Mac and friends engage in an extended dance off at a McDonalds' with Ronald McDonald, members of a football team, and several of the employees. The ending credits even include a credit for \"Ronald McDonald, as himself.\" If you look very closely during the dance off scene, you can actually see the director in the background, waving a handful of bills, because even he wants you to know what a cynical cash grab this movie is.Now by this point we've already seen adult sized aliens sucked face first into a vacuum cleaner, and our little protagonist fall off a cliff, wheelchair and all. But it's from the McDonald's scene onward that things really go off the rails into the realm of utter madness. In short order we're treated to the aforementioned resurrection via Coke, a shoot out with the cops, and a massive, fiery explosion in which half the cast appears to die. No points for guessing whether everyone is fine in the end. And I dare anyone not to burst out laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of the final scene, which takes place in a courthouse of all places.Now I've mentioned that the aliens are ugly, but I haven't said just how ugly. These things look like someone crossed ET with a deformed pig and a blow-up doll, then decided to add horns in case audiences couldn't already tell that these things are of the devil. I cannot fathom how such monstrosities were allowed into a children's movie.So yes, Mac and Me is absolutely awful. It is one of the most cynical cash grabs ever unleashed upon movie going audiences by Hollywood, and is pathetic in every respect except for most of its production values. And yet every minute of it is so gloriously inept, incoherent, and utterly insane that you can't look away. It is so perfectly awful and unintentionally hilarious that it can't possibly be the worst movie ever. This is an experience you have to see to believe. Preferably with lots of friends and some comedic help from Jonah and the 'bots.",

And not only that, it rips off a major moment from STARMAN, right down to the aliens walking through fire. The level of product placement is astounding. I haven't seen this much Coke on screen since BLOW (ah, boo yourself!). I counted 15 moments where characters offer up a Coke (Skittles and McDonalds get off light compared to that). Seriously, one could start a Coca-Cola drinking game with this but I fear people participating might have their teeth rot out by the end of the 90 minutes. I will say that I like the alien designs better than the horrifically ugly E.T., even if these aliens do look like Imogene Coca in NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION. I will also give the production credit for casting a real boy in a wheelchair in the lead. I will give them a hug and kiss for throwing said boy off a cliff.

One little boy alien named Mac (an acronym for Mysterious Alien Creature) befriends plucky crippled kid Eric (winningly played by real-life disabled kid Jade Calegory). Eric helps Mac get reunited with his family. Co-written and directed with staggering ineptitude by Stewart Raffill, with a syrupy, swelling ersatz John Williams orchestral mush score by Alan Silvestri, plenty of shameless product plugs for the fast food chain McDonald's (Ronald McDonald even makes a highly unwelcome cameo appearance!), a soundtrack full of dreadful power pop ballads, cruddy (far from) special effects, and loads of unintentional belly laughs, this awesomely atrocious abomination rates as a total four-star so-stinky-it's-strangely-sublime schlocky hoot. The cast turn in astoundingly awful performances: Jonathan Ward as Eric's jerky, obnoxious tool of an older brother Michael, Christine Ebersole as Eric's harried mother Janet, Katrina Caspary as hot teenage brunette Courtney, Lauren Stanley as spunky little girl Debbie, and George \"Buck\" Flower as a bumbling supermarket security guard. The aliens are truly freaky-looking buggers: With their shriveled-up prune faces, big, wide, googly saucer eyes, spindly limbs, bony builds, pot bellies, and wobbly walks, they are more creepy and ugly than cute and cuddly. Gut-busting highlights include Mac being fried by an electric fence, Eric rolling down a cliff and crashing into a lake, Debbie getting strapped to the back of an out of control vacuum cleaner, Eric racing through a street and a shopping center with Mac on his lap, and the jaw-dropping protracted dance party sequence at a McDonald's restaurant with Mac in a teddy bear outfit cutting loose with these pathetic herky-jerky rug-tearin' moves.

Also perplexing were the jogging scene with musical score (even Phil Collins at his worst would have been an improvement) and the cameo by that annoying red-headed kid from 'Different Strokes'.

There is no more product placement than seen in many other films, but it is so poorlyintegrated I can understand why people see it as obnoxious.  The rest of the film is disjointed and many scenes are superfluous, but there are plenty of movies aimed at the family market that are just as objectionable.  I enjoyed watching it on cable last night for the first time (if only to laugh at it), but I can see why kids may have enjoyed it.  I remember when it was theatrically released during mychildhood.  Yet even at that time it looked ridiculous, lacking the camp appeal it has now.To respond to some of the site users who mentioned Alan Silvestri's score asbeing well done.  He is not a bad composer, but he blatantly rips off a lot of his own work (or recycles it), such as his most impressive score (Back to theFuture).  Not to mention, he rips off bits from Jerry Goldsmith's score to Gremlins (Gizmo's accompanying whistling noises now provided by Mac).  This proveshow little originality existed anywhere in this film.I will agree with everyone that the aliens are awful looking: they are creepy, funny, and altogether unpleasant to see onscreen (even in clothing at the end of the film).  As for the dance number, though it was ridiculous, the dancers were better than the majority of the actors in the film.Small note:  It seemed a little odd that the doctor pulled out a half-used bottle of sedatives from his pocket and gave one to the lead character after the ravine incident.",

I'm thinking that this is selective memory, because this movie makes such a crappy impression that it's hard to forget.This movie's first strike is that it's a blatant rip-off of E.T, and they couldn't even wait till the next decade to try and capitalize on it. E.T. at least was a good movie that kids and adults alike could enjoy, if for different reasons. Mac and Me is clearly aimed at kids, but it falls woefully short by virtue of the fact that it's no fun for kids and the aliens are very disturbing in appearance. There are no jokes or scenarios that adults (or kids for that matter) would find funny. As noted by other reviewers, there are numerous product placements made in such an obvious way that it's laughable any ad exec would want to take part. In fact, most people that do remember this film remember most vividly the McDonald's break-dance scene. A pack of perfectly choreographed kids manage to fend off government thugs trying to get \"Mac\" by busting into an 80's break dance. In McDonalds. What? The most irritating part is the alien family. They live on some moon that US spacecrafts can visit and return to earth from (this is set in the present day of 1988, mind you). They drink a dark liquid (Coke, evidently) out of the ground. Throughout the film, they never show any sign of thought above the level of sea slug, they just mope around looking dumb, drunk, and without genitals. They waddle when they walk. They have some sort of mystical power by which they can resurrect the dead (huh?). Then, at the end of the movie, when you think that surely they go away, NO, they are naturalized as US citizens and given driver's licenses so they can drive a pink Cadillac convertible around. The government thugs have reversed the short-sightedness of their plan to study the aliens, and decide that they will allow space aliens to live among us, so long as they wear clothes from now on. This movie is just so random.Thank god they never made a sequel to this (it appears that they wanted to - \"We'll be back!\") and thank God that this movie will sink to the bowels of society's collective consciousness. What makes this movie so bad is that it almost defies logic that such a bad film of total incoherence would come from a big budget release and a reputable studio.",

            "content": "in a bad way!Back in the late 1980's, quite a few movies that were considered to be among the worst ever made were coming out to theaters. This was one of them, and I'm quite surprised that Steven Spielberg didn't sue for royalties when this E.T. rip-off was released to theaters in '88.Honestly, if you take Mac And Me as a kiddie film, it's not bad. However, the fact that it's a rip-off of one the most popular films ever made, has a horrible script that not even Denzel Washington could improve on, and is filled with product placements galore just makes the film absolutely horrible.I certainly remember that dance scene at the McDonald's; at the time, shows like Kids Incorporated and Kid Videos, which were corny and cheesy kiddie shows with lip-synching rugrats with attitudes were quite popular then. I have that scene etched in my mind, with a bunch of hip 80's pre-teens dancing up a storm. It was very painful to watch and it wasn't choreographed very well. The music was also quite bad. Also, Ronald McDonald earned a Razzie award as \"Worst New Actor\".Although the film did have one redeeming benefit (some of the money it made would be donated to Ronald McDonald House, a worthy cause), you somehow wonder if the idea of starring a non-acting paraplegic child thespian was a good idea. There was probably a casting call for wheelchair bound kids, and the winner was the strangely named Jade Calegory. Jade? Jade?!? Isn't Jade a woman's name? I sure hope that's his middle name. Add in the fact that his character's name was Eric Cruise! Cruise? Cruise?!? Is he related to Tom Cruise?If you've seen E.T., you've seen this one; it's the same film. Mac actually looks like a cute Yoda clone, but he really hasn't got the charm E.T. had. Also, tons of companies shill their wares in this film, led by McDoanld's, Coca-Cola, and Sears-Roebuck. Also, the cast is filled with horrible actors and is just so saccharine. It has no edge.Sadly (or gladly), the film isn't on DVD, and I doubt it'll ever arrive on DVD (although it might) due to it's infamy. Still, if you ever see this film mentioned in the T.V. Guide, check this trainwreck out. See how long you can go before you start going MST3K on it.",

I worked in an elementary school for several years and have seen a plethora of fantastic children movies.But this movie was terrible. In fact, I rate it as the worst movie I have ever seen. Why? Several reasons...1. It is a blatant attempt to ride the coattails of ET and similar alien-friend movies from this era. Unfortunately, I think it sat on the wrong coat.2. The film used pity tactics to attempt to draw in your emotions rather than effective writing or visuals, and those tactics failed miserably. 3. The special effects were horrible even for the time. I can relate to chronological limitations in relation to special effects and can respect a film that meets or exceeds the effects available for it's time. But there were plenty of good sfx films out by the time this film was released and this one simply didn't bother with any sfx budget. 4. The dialog was awful. This is an example where no amount of good acting could compensate for the dialog. 5. In relation to reason #4, there was no good acting to attempt to overcome the bad dialog. That might not even be the blame of the actors themselves, as there are simply times when you can't rise above your surroundings. 6. The cheesy marketing and glaring promotions within the film take an already terrible movie and turn it into a true mockery.7. I have seen B-Movies that were more enjoyable to watch. However, out of morbid curiosity, I watched this film from opening to closing credits.From start to finish, from effects to acting, from dialog to directing - Mac and Me is a very bad movie. Just because a film is made for children does not mean it's OK to be terrible. Children's films, just like any genre, have a majority of moderately enjoyable films, a number of gems, and their share of stinkers. This is a true stinker.

            "content": "In 1982, Steven Spielberg's film E.T. was released, and it was a lovely movie that gained critical attention, and did very well at the box office. Mac and Me seems to have the opinion \"Why not cash in on someone else's success?\" This is a bad rip-off if I've ever seen one. It probably would've been better if Mac and Me copied E.T. scene by scene, because though it would've been an even bigger rip-off, it would have at least retained some of the magic E.T. had. As it stands this is a weird flick, and in no way can it be qualified as magical.Some aliens are on their planet when a NASA spacecraft lands and vacuums them up. They end up on Earth, and all four of them escape. Three escape into the desert, and the youngest one, Mac, ends up in a suburban area, where he meets paraplegic Eric and his family. It's hard to come up with any more plot synopsis, as this film has no plot. The F.B.I. is after Mac, and they search high and low for him, from the busy streets, to the crazy dance hall known as McDonalds. Chaos ensues as Mac tries to find his family and the idiot F.B.I. agents try to find him.This movie has been criticized galore for it's constant references to products. Basically, this is a 90 minute long commercial. Coca Cola is constantly shown on screen, and some scenes play off as actual Coke TV spots. McDonalds is often mentioned, and this film is mother to the infamous synchronized McDonalds dance scene, which is as lame and corny as any other dance scene ever. Skittles also appear frequently and Mac loves them, so should you. Buy Skittles, buy McDonalds, buy Coca Cola and buy any other product we jam in your face. This movie left a bad taste in my mouth that Skittles, McDonalds and Coke would only worsen.The acting is OK. It's about standard for an average kid's flick, despite that this was well below average all together. The puppet of Mac was about as real looking as Kermit the Frog, if not less so. Mac, and his family, always had their mouth in the same circular position, and instead of walking, Mac seemed to roll along as though being wheeled around by a talentless puppeteer. Mac is an ugly puppet, as his family are downright scary looking.Dozens of mistakes can be seen throughout the movie, but this is a small thing compared to the incompetence of the rest of the movie. Start a drinking game where you take a shot every time you spot a Mac and Me mistake. I guarantee you won't make it to the end of the movie.Horrible writing...one awful line after the next! As Mac rides on a remote control car towards a girl and her mother, the mother asks, \"Is that guy crazy or something?\" Does a remote control car look like a guy? That doesn't even make sense. The little girl should have replied, \"No idiot! Are you blind?\" The little handicapped boy is blamed for messing up a room, yet he obviously cannot get out of his wheelchair, but still his mother punishes him. Nice woman, very practical thinker. Eric rides his wheelchair through the street with Mac on his lap as the F.B.I. chases him. Cars are crashing to avoid hitting him, and he just mindlessly rolls away. He should've been locked up for that. What a careless little creep.I like the musical score here. It's like a good rip-off of John William's score for E.T., but not as good. Still, it's the best part of the movie.Overall, this movie is just awful. The special effects are bad, the writing is horrendous and the commercials are plentiful. This is recommended only for enthusiasts of cinema that equals a long painful enema.My rating: BOMB out of ****. 99 mins. PG for brief mild language and violence.",

I just can't respect this as a real movie. It's soooooo much ET and such a blatant advertisement for diabetes water: coca cola, and MacPoop food. And those aliens... those horrible animatronics and faces that are disturbing to look at. It really highlights how amazing that Spielberg's movie could make an alien that could be seen as almost grotesque, lovable. Man, these producers in the 80's must've really, really thought children were stupid. Do not see this whatever you do. Save yourself!",

Mac and Me was just plain dumb. Beyond dumb. Beyond the valley of the SHADOW of dumb.

            "content": "This movie Mac & Me looks like rotten Mac & Cheese. It's really gross-looking. This movie alienated me, because of that. It took me, multiply sittings to finally finish, watching this film. Directed by Stewart Raffill, the movie tells the story of a \"Mysterious Alien Creature\" AKA MAC who is befriended by a paraplegia boy, Eric Cruise (Jade Calegory), after escaping a NASA space probe facility. Together, they hope to try to find MAC's family, from whom the alien has been separated and reunited them. Without spoiling the movie too much, it's clear that this movie was made to capitalize on the success of 1982's Steven Spielberg's E.T. There are a lot of similarities to E.T, such as nefarious NASA agents chase scenes, the use of product placement candy to lure the creature out, and most of all, the look of the alien, which looks very similar to the design for E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. In my opinion, all these similarities make it felt like the movie is just an E.T knockoff. The movie is really dumb. The look of the aliens is really bad. They look and move like drunk idiots, with their goofy open mouth expression. I found the way, they got on Earth in the first place, kinda jarring. Honestly, how in the hell, did they get the suck up by an unmanned space probe? They look like they couldn't have fit. Also, how did they survive the trip back to Earth? Wouldn't the cold of space, killed them!? How would Eric know that sucking MAC into a vacuum cleaner would work unless he saw what happened at the beginning of the film? The movie never does explain, any of these plot-holes, as the movie rushed over that to get to the more common, boy meeting the alien plot thread. I like how the movie feature, a disabled kid as the main character. It's rarely used, even today. It's just nice, seeing real disabled people, getting big roles. I kinda like how character is using a wheelchair, but I kinda wish, they explain his backstory, a little more, on why they were moving to California from Illinois, and why he was in the wheelchair in the first place. I really hate Eric's mother, Janet (Christine Ebersole). She come across as really mean. It was bit, a stretch to blame your wheelchair bound, son for redesigning your living room into a desert. It's not like, he was able to do that, on his own, in one night. This woman is horrible. I really didn't mind, the supporting kid actors. Most of them, played their roles, as they were told. I just wish, they had more of reaction to the aliens, that what they were giving. This film also marks the film debut of a then-unknown Jennifer Aniston, who features as an uncredited extra. So look for that. The dialogue is pretty bland. Nothing, really clever. I didn't care too much on Eric's older brother, Michael (Jonathan Ward)'s romantic sub-plot, falling in love, with neighbor, Courtney (Tina Caspary). The jokes were mostly a miss than a hit. It wasn't really funny. Unlike it was accidentally funny, like the supposed, serious scene, where Eric in a wheelchair loses control and rolls downhill off a cliff and into water where he nearly drowns. I know, it's not supposed to be funny, but I nearly laugh myself to death, on how random slapstick, the scene looks. You gotta admit the wheelchair stunts are pretty impressive. Yes, this scene be a bit much for younger viewers, especially any who know kids in wheelchairs, but come on, anybody who see this clip on Conan O'Brien's shows or internet channels, knows how 'so bad-it's good' funny it was. It was probably the highlight of the film. Most the action scenes are alright, but badly done. I did find it, a bit weird for the absurdity of the grocery store, blowing up, due to a minor gun-shot, and Eric turning to a cutout, that was added in post. The special effect failures are so clear, as many of the special effects look so dated, even at the time, and fake-looking. The vacuum, sucking scenes are probably the worst. One of the worst things about the film, is how it feels more like a commercial, than a film. There are tons of blatant product placements shown in the film, including Coca-Cola, Skittles, Sears, but the most had to be the pervasive promotion of McDonalds. The contrivance of the \"Mysterious Alien Creature\" being referred to by the acronym \"MAC\", the aliens coming from the planet of \"Quartus Poundus\", the five-minute dance number in a McDonald's restaurant featuring Ronald McDonald, and the use of Ronald McDonald to introduce the film's theatrical trailer, really oversteps the boundaries. I know that the movie was there to promote good causes like Ronald McDonald's house, but, they really didn't market it, like that, when it came out. It comes across, more like greedy, obnoxious and shameless, plugging of how good, their product was. The music, that the movie used, weren't that great. \"Take Me, I'll Follow You\" by Bobby Caldwell, Flint River Band's \"Wait And Break My Heart Tomorrow\" & Jara Lane, \"You're Not a Stranger Anymore\" don't really match the film, that well. Composer, Alan Silvestri's score is way better than the movie deserves. In my opinion, it's the only thing, in the film, that it's too good for this mess of a movie. The ending to the film is really bad. The film ends with a freeze frame and the words \"We'll be back!\" superimposed, but after egregious reviews and box office returns, the planned sequel was cancelled permanently. Thank Goodness. Overall: fans of the so-bad-it's-good school of movie watching will find much to enjoy in the cheese and the awfulness, but other than that. This movie is not worth it. Don't recommended. Wish, I was watching, Steven Spielberg's E.T, instead.",

Or is it that the movie is essentially a 90-minute commercial (complete with a dance sequence in a McDonald's)? Whatever the answer is, the point is that this movie is the celluloid equivalent of a human rights abuse. It has NO good qualities, not a single one (it was incidental that this was Jennifer Aniston's debut). I have seen a number of crummy movies that turned out to have sort of an enjoyable side. Hell, I even took \"Myra Breckinridge\" and \"Mommie Dearest\" seriously (no, really, I did). But \"Mac and Me\" is probably the movie that Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank could've shown Mike, Servo and Crow to make them go insane on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". For the life of me I cannot figure out why Steven Spielberg didn't sue the makers of \"Mac and Me\" for copying \"E.T.\" (then again, maybe it's better that he didn't, since it would've given the ripoff undeserved publicity).It should come as no surprise that this litany of awfulness regularly shows up on lists of the worst movies ever made. It makes any Ed Wood movie look like a cross between \"Citizen Kane\" and \"Dr. Strangelove\". Thankfully, audiences recognized it for what it was and it bombed, and so there was no sequel.",

The box alone was more than adequate warning of how horrible this film truly is. Unfortunately, I had the misfortune of glimpsing it one day on television and mistakenly figured I'd watch at little to see how bad it was.I can think of nothing good about this film. The horrid creature, \"Mac\", is so poorly made that it is truly disturbing. This was the primary impetus for me turning it off because I simply couldn't stand to see that thing one second more. In addition, the acting is utterly abysmal and what I saw of the story appeared to be a moronic rip off of already tired elements from E.T., itself not exactly a great cinematic achievement.Apparently, there is much more about this film that is awful, such as alleged Coke and McDonald's plugs and dance routines, etc., but I couldn't stand the film long enough for those elements to lodge themselves in my brain and I cannot personally comment on them. Suffice it to say, that this film is an absolute monstrosity even without those added negatives.Normally I do not write opinions of films unless I have seen basically the whole thing, but I felt that in this instance, I had adequate exposure, and my opinion was strong enough, that a comment was appropriate.",

You see, \"Mac\" isn't so much a movie as a joint commercial venture between mega-corps McDonald's and Coca-Cola. Literally. The two companies produced the film in order to advertise their products to young children, to ingrain the youth of America in an attempt to guarantee lifetime allegiance to their brand names.The plot is \"E.T.\"-lite. It involves a kid in a wheelchair who finds a rubbery fish-like alien stranded on Earth. But the true fun of the film are the corporate set-pieces: There is a musical number at the local McDonald's (all immaculate and bright) in which the staff and manager all join in with Ronald himself (!) to boogie down on bout the joys of saturated fat. In the film's startling finale, Mac's extended alien family breaks into a supermarket for Coca-Cola, to which they have become addicted!

McDonalds, Sears, Coca- Cola and Volkswagen and you know this right away.The reason and only reason to watch this is if this the only thing on late night TV and you have no other options to available.Right away you have to suspend your beliefs in reality. It starts out on a planet near Earth. So close in fact that it only takes seconds to get from the near by planet to Earth. Also you have to assume on this unnamed near by planet that it has life forms that obviously have bones in their bodies and range from 2 1/2 feet tall to almost 7 feet tall can be sucked up by a 10 inch diameter vacuum and survive space travel in something 1/2 the size of a Mini Cooper.This movie has bad special effects, yes this movie was made in 1988 but we had ALL the Star Wars movies (1977 to 1983), Flight of the Navigator, Tron, Muppet Movies just to name a few that had better effects than this movie. Smallest alien ranges from a about 2 feet tall to over 3 feet tall (this is especially noticeable when the boy in the wheel chair carries Mac (the smallest alien), Mac gets into the vehicle to go to McDonalds, and when Mac dances (badly) on the McDonalds counter). You are supposed to also believe that drinking Coke is the only thing that gives the/these Alien(s) energy.It's very obvious that all the money for this movie mainly went to make 4 alien suits/puppets and they used Uncle Bob's Quick Build Creature Shop.The boy in the wheel chair and his older brother live with their widowed mother and they moved to California for a new job their mother got at Sears (one of the 4 sponsors). Their mother some how first blames the boys for destroying the house, especially the boy in the wheel chair. This makes no sense, It is obvious from where the drill and circular saw are used in places too high for him to handle in a wheel chair. Then when the house \"Magically\" get put back to normal she thanks the boys. I don't know if the scenes were filmed showing the Mac putting things back or not and it got cut but from how cheap they made this movie I am sure it was never filmed.Early in the movie you know McDonalds is a major part of this movie. The boys meet their new neighbors a set of girls that are about the same age as the boys. They immediately invite the boy in the wheel chair to a birthday party at McDonalds, where the older girl just happens to work at. Within two days, boy in w.c., his brother and youngest girl meet the smallest alien. When it's time to go to the birthday party the girl's mother picks up the boy in w.c. at his home. Though the mother questions the girl as to why he has a teddy bear, she doesn't seem to care when the large teddy bear crawls into the back of the car and is alive.There are a few good things but this doesn't really make it a good movie. Script and acting is good but that doesn't help.You also see a lot of mistakes. Puppet strings, effects, changes in smallest alien size, though a major sponsor to the movie McDonalds cups are not used when at the McDonalds restaurant, that there is always people at McDonalds that are trained dancers and just break out and dance all of a sudden, That three 20 something football players hang out at McDonalds in uniform and also know how to dance. Early in the movie you see vehicles crashing, this is where \"Mac\" the smallest alien gets into the boy in w.c.'s van. The vehicles in the crash a light gray/dark gray Mercury Cougar and a Cream and brown GM Truck are in this crash are later seen in a car chase later on in the movie.

I'm sorry to say, that after I finally saw it in my fifth grade class, I was truly appalled and disappointed in it after seeing it.Please bare with me, because I had not seen it since 1989.I think the teachers did it to get back at many of us for misbehaving in class. Here is my somewhat short summary about it. It all starts on a distant planet, where the aliens use reeds as straws to sip a drink in the ground. I'm not sure if they are supposed to be a race of stretchy, elongated cows or goats, but thats what they kind of looked like to me.A satellite sent to space, lands and starts collecting dirt and rock samples, but when the aliens get too close, it decides to collect them too. It arrives back home at the (NASA I think ) space station, and when the scientists open it, they escape. While trying to escape to the desert, the baby, alien calf gets lost. Now, all that I've told you so far may make the story seem great, but it starts to take a nose dive once they start the overkill; with product placement.If this is what they were going to do, why didn't they simply make fun of product placement in movies, in this movie? It could've been a true cult classic right there, and possibly a landmark movie. I'm not sure how they would've worked those aliens in there, but someone with creative talent could've pulled it off. Maybe in order for Mac and Me to truly be saved, someone like Frank Oz needs to rewrite the script.Just like he did with Little Shop Of Horrors. Now that movie was turned into gold. Really, it needs a better script without it being bogged down with the said product placement, a better middle without the dorky dance scene, and a much better ending. As long as they don't pollute it with gross out toilet humor, like most so called crappy kiddie films out there.That is the only good thing I can say about this turkey, it don't have flatulent jokes in it. Or evil bratty kids for that matter. Also the look of the aliens needs a lot of work. They not only look like they are half asleep, but the adults look absolutely creepy, like something you might see in a carnival fun house. They could use better colors too, not look like dried out leather. Maybe make them look like green martians or something. Really, it is so bad it makes Pod People almost look good!

I was so relieved when the aliens got their coke and got better.The opening scene where they are on their home planet and a NASA probe lands is great, they get sucked up like in a hoover and then the scientists open the probe and find them. In reality it would have taken the probe a couple of years at least to reach Earth and the aliens should have all starved to death by then from lack of fizzy drinks, but I can let that go.The acting was good I think. I looked at the child actors and none of them have been in anything much since Mac and Me. The wheelchair kid has not even had a little background role in a TV series or anything. I was interested to see where they were now. Only Tina Caspary was listed and apparently she is with a travelling dance company.It's not really THAT much like E.T. it's more fun. The story is similar I guess kid from a divorced family meets alien. But the alien does not go home at the end but stays on Earth. The song at the end makes cry a lot, as the alien family becomes a family of Earth and everyone kisses each other.The speech bubble that says, We'll be back was a lie though! they never made a sequel! WHY NOT? Oh how I wish they would. Allt eh actors would be grown up now, but it would be an interesting film nonetheless I feel.I am aware that I am in the minority opinion about Mac and Me, but I can't help what I like.",

            "content": "Wow. The incredible level of suckage in this film is amazing. A brief synopsis: So the film starts out on a barren planet. There is a family of aliens roaming around trying to drink stuff out of the ground when they are able to find it. The aliens resemble skinny Mickey Rooneys, if he was naked with reddish skin and stoned out of his gourd. A NASA pod thing lands on their planet to take samples, accidentally sucking up the entire family who apparently have no bones. In what is probably the shortest mission in NASA history, the pod takes off and leaves about 45 seconds later.The pod gets back to Earth, freeing the extra-terrestrial family into a science lab. The youngest alien gets separated from the family and ends up in the van of a family moving to a new home. The main kid in the flick, Eric, is crippled, adding a level of manipulation that probably had Disney drooling. But he's a lame crippled kid, not like the one at the end of Sidekicks, who I'd like to believe turned into a badass.Anyway, the alien destroys the house, because he's a dick like that and everyone blames Eric. Distraught, Eric goes for walk (read: roll) out behind his house, where there's a hill. The brakes go out on his wheelchair (Meineke missing a prime ad spot in this product placement free-for-all) and Eric rolls uncontrollably downhill and plunges off a cliff from about 50 feet in the air. The alien (who I guess is the \"Mac\" of the title, must have missed that part) saves his stupid ass from drowning.After having his life saved, Eric decides to try and take Mac's. So with the help of his neighbor, a gruff-voiced girl presumably around his age, they trap him in a vacuum cleaner which damn near kills the thing. Here's where advertising comes in. The kids save the alien by giving him Coca-Cola, utilizing the soft drink's well documented medicinal properties. With everyone happy and alive, they dress Mac up like a teddy bear and go to a party at McDonald's where everyone is dancing because McDonald's is awesome like that.Some government guys chase them around (through a Sears) and they end up finding Mac's family in a mine in the desert. They were near death and with the help of some more Coca-Cola, that magical elixir of the gods, the kids heal the whole family. They then bring the aliens back to town where they cause a huge explosion that kills Eric. Yep. The crippled kid gets blowed up. But the aliens bring him back to life (surprisingly enough, without the use of Coca-Cola). So everyone now loves the aliens. And in the most retarded ending I've ever seen, they become U.S. citizens and drive around in a Cadillac.But don't worry, the story isn't the only sh-tty thing here. The acting, special effects, cinematography and music are all awful. It is hilarious in its awfulness, though. But it still may be the worst film I've seen.",

This movie metaphorically said that in every alien there is an American dying to get out, and how they would go to any length to be Americanized! The family of aliens at the beginning of the film were shown as pathetic creatures, on a barren planet, drinking brown goo out of the ground through straws. Through the grace of God they were brought to America, and their failing bodies were revitalized with Coca-Cola, and shown great American hospitality at a McDonalds Restaurant. Now I ask you what would have happened to this family if they ended up in Russia? They wouldn't have been able to benefit from the medicinal properties of Coca-Cola, and they would have died under a Communist Government! The cynical youth of today, who have no faith in a higher-power and trust in the ways of science say this movie is a blatant E.T. Ripoff. Lord have mercy on them for they know not what they do; for this film is about aliens who try at any length to become citizens of Gods Country: America, and finally succeed, as well as adopt American ways and customs!

            "review_title": "A Ronald McDonald Production",
            "content": "A movie that improves with time.  In 1988 this film grossed only 6 million dollars in the U.S.  If it had been released today it would have gone straight to video and perhaps faired better.  In 1988 \"E.T.\" was considered the new American classic, and Speilberg's best (light years before he turned serious).  Today, direct-to-video rip-offs following popular theatrical fare have a strong following and are enjoyable on several levels (\"Jurassic Park\" fans can see more-violent or more child friendly versions of this film ranging from \"Carnasaur\" to \"Prehysteria\").  So we've seen this plot before (TV is built around showing the same plots over and over again garnering awards and fans).  If it were not for recycled plots how many westerns would have been made?  How many TV series?  E.T. was an inspired piece of filmmaking but hardly original and essentially an 80's look at the familiar boy-and-his-dog story.  This type of story telling didn't end with \"Old Yeller.\"  What hurts this film is that the products do get in the way of the story.  I can see where having a character dress in a McDonald's uniform is a clever way of distinguishing the cultural setting of 1980's California (an update on the waitress uniform so common in older films).  Years ago Red Skelton had great fun in movies built around \"The Good Humor Man,\" \"The Fuller Brush Man,\" and \"The Yellow Cab Man.\"  What great pieces of Americana they have turned out to be (especially for those who are too young to remember Fuller Brush men); but there was just too much focus on the McDonald's itself (as opposed to what is like to WORK at McDonald's), and Ronald McDonald is about as out of place as anything could be in a movie. Coke has probably popped up in more films than any actor ever will (and when Coke shows up it usually shows up several times in a film...trucks, billboards, machines, etc...without any other liquid refreshment in sight.) Here's a good game, see how many films you can watch on video WITHOUT spotting Coke.  A bit of trivia, the director of this film also made \"The Philadelphia Experiment\" which probably holds the record for Coke appearances.  \"Mac and Me\" is not subtle (hence the name...hence the appearance of Ronald McDonald...hence the use of Coca Cola as a miracle medicine!) which destroys a lot that could have been fun.  Reminders of our culture must be woven into the plot (the Circle K in \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\" comes to mind).  If the producers had eased up on the overkill, then the rest of the film would be just fine.  The producers used a wheel-bound young actor for the lead who is terrific.  The E.T. like puppet is also enjoyable (E.T. was not the first puppet used on film, nor the first alien puppet--remember \"Close Encounters\"?, just the first cute alien puppet I suspect).  Better yet, McDonald's would have faired better embracing this film as a promotion and sold it in their restaurants as a Ronald McDonald film (with \"Mac and Me\" Happy Meal toys).  Every kid who came into the restaurant would have seen the promotional stand-up and ask to have the movie.  The parents would look down at the Ronald McDonald poster and think \"oh this is harmless fun, why not?\"  Expecting to see a full length version of a Saturday morning McDonald's commercial the actual product scenes wouldn't have seemed so much and the entertaining story a pleasant surprise.",

College students and people with well-developed senses of irony will enjoy it in a completely different way.  And older viewers are likely to appreciate it on yet another level for its genuine good nature and surprisingly heartfelt sentiments about issues such as friendship, family, and disability.The alien in the film is funny but not scary looking and little kids will enjoy watching him get into mischief, make friends with humans, and try to get back to his family.That said, there are also many, many scenes in this film that are of the \"so bad they're good\" variety.  Almost to the point where one has to wonder whether or not the filmmakers knew that they were making an MST3K-style classic.  Huge stretches of the film are laughably bad in a remarkably entertaining way.  Most notable of these scenes are the one involving Mac being chased by all the neighborhood dogs while riding in a toy truck, the wheelchair-in-traffic scene, the wheelchair-off-the-cliff scene, and of course the infamous McDonald's song and dance number.  Busby Berkeley and Ray Kroc would have been proud.This film has received a lot of flack for being one big commercial, which it essentially is, but if I remember correctly, a portion of the proceeds went to the Ronald McDonald House children's charity.  The lead character, Eric, is played by a wheelchair-bound young actor and refreshingly, his disability is not dwelled upon or focused on in any special way.  He's shown as a completely normal kid (except for the fact that he has an alien friend, of course).Surprisingly, despite all the ways in which this film is bad, one way it isn't is in its underlying sweetness.  As implausible as everything else in the film is, the relationships between the characters come across as genuine and even quite poignant at times, especially the ones between Eric and Mac, and between Eric's mother and her two sons.  This is by no means a deep film, but it does possess a real humanity.Without a trace of sarcasm in my voice I would definitely say that this is a better film than E.T.  If for no other reason than the fact that it's enjoyable on more different levels.  If you're thinking about renting it I would definitely recommend it.

Their sense of humor and fun helped make me who I am today. Yet for all the reasons and more, one of the biggest is that they never forced me to watch movies that were made for kids.A NASA vehicle is taking soil samples when it ends up vacuuming four aliens and taking them back to Earth. Quickly, that family of Sea Monkey looking aliens escapes, because they can heal or destroy anything they touch. However, the youngest gets seperated and ends up tagging along with the Cruise family: wheelchair-using Eric, older brother Michael and their mother Janet (Christine Ebersole, whose career is filled with horror, like the 1980-81 SNL season and the Bill Cosby vehicle Ghost Dad).The Cruise family has moved from Chicago to Sacremento, but the alien ruins most of their new home near instantly. Eric tries to catch him, but his wheelchair goes flying down a hill (if you've seen Paul Rudd on Conan, you know this scene).The alien, now known as MAC (Mysterious Alien Creature), is on the run from the FBI. That doesn't stop them from going to a McDonald's birthday party - more on that in a bit - with MAC disguised as a teddy bear.The journey to reunite MAC with his family ends up getting Eric killed. Yep, this is a kid movie where the main kid gets shot in the crossfire between an alien and the police. Look for George \"Buck\" Flower as a security guard!Seriously, if you get the Japanese VHS of this, Eric is graphically shot.\nLuckily, those aliens can heal anything they can touch, right? Once the government sees this, they just forget using the aliens as a weapon and harvesting their organs. No, they give them American citizenship and let them live in peace. Obviously, this is the kind of insane border policy that President Trump is railing against.So about all the McDonald's - the producer of the film had worked with the fast food titan on several ad campaigns and with their Ronald McDonald House Charities. He also wanted to create an E.T. for a new generation, which is strange considering that Spielberg's film had only been made six years earlier.That's when he hatched his scam. He could use the McDonald's brand throughout the film, the restaurants would promote it and the proceeds would go to the charity. These are the kind of ideas that advertising professionals - trust me, I am one - do lots of drugs after they come up with, as they realize they have no soul left.While McDonald's didn't expressly finance the film, Golden State Foods, their food service arm, did fund some of it. The brand didn't want their mascot, Ronald McDonald, to appear. However, he's all over the dance sequence in the film and its trailer.The film doubles up on endorsing products, with Sears and Coca-Cola showing up in nearly every scene and Skittles - instead of Reese's Pieces - being consumed by MAC. Hell, even his name suggests McDonald's! The shrapnel ended up exploding all over Ronald, with him winning Worst New Star in the 9th Golden Raspberry Awards.This is the kind of movie you love because you grew up on it. Or hate your parents. Probably both. I'm glad I didn't watch it until I owned my own home and had discovered my own unique identity.",

In my opinion, the sole bright spot is Jade Calegory, who gives a courageous and touching performance, plus she is the only actress who looks natural within the film. The rest of the acting is not good at all, even from Christine Ebersole. Coming off worst is Jonathan Ward who is incredibly obnoxious and annoying here.As for Mac himself, he isn't in the least bit endearing, he is ugly, artificial and annoyed me rather than touched me. The story is predictable, and further suffers from clich\u00e9d characters, uneven pacing and a flat ending. The production values look as though the film was on the cheap, the music is execrable and enough to rip out your ear-drums and the direction is uninspired. The script is absolutely awful too, being both unfunny and cloying.Overall, an awful movie. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

That terrible background guitar sound that was created, and used in every shot of EVERY SINGLE MOVIE IN THAT ENTIRE DECADE!

Let's just say, it's worse than current flops \"Batman and Robin\", \"Maid in Manhattan\" and \"Spy Kids 2\". That's bad.  The 'story' focuses on a wheelchair bound kid (I forget the 'actor's name, I'll just call him \"Random Cutie\") who meets up with an alien (Mac) that has been seperated from its parents.  Mac looks so much like E.T. that I thought it was a sequel to the Speilberg flick, well, up to when the \"movie\" started to get really bad.Why rip-off E.T. anyway?  Everyone knows your ripping it off, because E.T. is the only 'good' (I use that term loosely) 'Alien-and-boy-form-unlikely-friendship' movie.  It's like making a rip-off of Lord of the Rings, except make Frodo and the Ring form an unlikely friendship, and having the ring about a billion times cuter.The worse part about \"Mac and Me\" is the various scenes when Mac just starts dancing.  He just starts dancing.  No reason, no relevancy to anything, just 'hip' eighties break dancing.  I'd imagine this is what gave Bruckheimer the idea for that abominable dream sequence in \"Kangaroo Jack\".  THAT'S bad.There is not one good thing to say about this movie.

            "content": "If there was ever a movie that most likely funded entirely on product placement, \"Mac and Me\" is that movie.  I stumbled across it on cable and had to rent the film to get the full effect.  It involves the predictable \"E.T.\" theme with an alien stranded on Earth and he must rely on children to get him back to his family.  These \"Mysterious Alien Creature\"s , or \"MAC\"s, are an amazing bunch that can be literally sucked into a vacuum tube, conduct electricity with their hands and still be able to swim and take showers, and can be rescued from death by drinking Coca Cola.The main character in the movie is Eric, a wheelchair-bound boy who moves with his family from Illinois to California so his mom can work at Sears and somehow afford a 3 bedroom house.  The family is so oblivious to what goes on around them that they fail to see the Mac wandering around the house, standing behind them and reading the newspaper in front of their house. Not even driving a mini car down the street being chased by a pack of dogs is enough to divert their attention.  After being lured down a steep hill by the ever-whistling Mac and surviving a 500 foot drop into the water, Eric vows to catch the creature. After a scene involving a dummy attached to a vacuum cleaner being spun around and pulled on a track, the Eric and Mac meet face to face. They become fast friends and eventually they attend the infamous party at McDonalds.  This party  includes a dance contest that seems to take place both inside and outside of McDonalds and a rare appearance by Ronald McDonald himself.  Carefully trying to avoid detection by advancing federal agents, Mac does a solo dance routine on the McDonalds sales counter wearing a teddy bear outfit.  The agents do eventually catch on and chase Eric down a hill and for ,what it seemed like, 10 miles on foot to Sears.At this point, I had to check if this movie was made in Canada but it wasn't.  It just made no sense whatsoever and begged the question \"why?\" about nearly everything.  The acting was horrible, the effects were miserable and it actually seemed as though they tried to make a good movie. That is why it has found a place in my heart along with the old MST3K movies I remember seeing.  I liken it to a car wreck.....they are never good to see, but you just have to look.",

            "content": "I invite you now to share in my pain as I relive \"Mac and Me: The Longest and Worst Skittles/Coke/McDonald's Commercial Ever Made\", also known as, \"E.T.: The Cheap Knock-off Version\".Our crappy film opens on an alien planet as a family of poorly-designed alien creatures use straws to drink carbonated soft drinks from the soil of their planet (more on that later). The arrival of an American space rover prompts the curious alien family (mom, dad and baby) to investigate, whistling and over-acting demonstrably until they are vacuumed into the ship and carried back to earth. Upon arriving on earth, the baby - Mac - is quickly separated from his creepy family and, after a madcap chase, lands in the back seat of a van carrying our story's hero, Eric, and his family.Eric is a teenage boy in a wheelchair. It is never made clear what is wrong with Eric's legs, but it is likely that his growth was stunted by his exclusive diet of Skittles, McDonald's and Coca-Cola. Before I get negative, I must give credit where it's due: The filmmakers were extremely diligent in making sure all Skittles and Coke products were clearly facing the camera at all times.Quick back story: Eric, his mother and his older brother (Michael, just like in E.T. - they didn't even bother to come up with a different name. How about Jeff? Ronnie? Come on, that's just lazy. I swear I have spent more time writing this review than the screenwriters spent on this script) have just moved from Ohio into Elliot's E.T. neighborhood in California because Eric's mom took a job at Sears. A history lesson for the youngsters: back in the 80's a lot of people moved their families across the country to take minimum wage jobs at department stores (citation: Grapes of Wrath). They moved because Eric's dad died or something. (And I'm not making this up: At one point Eric looks somberly at a picture of his dad, and NOT ONLY does his dad straight-up look like The Most Interesting Man in the World, there's a Dos Equis umbrella in the background of the picture. Best part of the movie, hands down.)With that, let me pause to address the reason we're all here today: The scene in which Eric rolls off a steep cliff into a pond in the family's backyard. In context, Eric is searching for Mac, then Mac saves him after he plummets off the 50-foot cliff. What you haven't seen is the following scene in which Eric's mom and the doctor both assume he was trying to commit suicide and the doctor hands Eric a bottle of anti- depressants. For real.Anyway, Eric and his next-door neighbor (and token Drew Barrymore Stand- In) Debbie discover Mac and use Skittles and Coke to befriend him, then bring Michael in on the secret as they try to find a way to get Mac back to his family while evading NASA. Every time Mac gets hurt or knocked unconscious, the children scramble to get him a Coke because as Debbie says, \"That must be what they drink on his planet!\"About an 75 minutes into the movie, our heroes go to a McDonald's for a birthday party which morphs into an all-out dance competition (as was common in the 80's). Dozens of dance crews clog the parking lot, popping and locking all over the place. One crew is dressed like the San Francisco 49ers. The children have disguised their alien friend by putting him inside a teddy bear's skin and he gets in on the action by dancing Pee Wee Herman-style on the McDonald's counter. It is terrible and amazing.Having reached the point in the movie where it's time to recreate the chase scene from E.T., NASA thugs show up and McDonald's and chase Eric and Mac through the streets. And while Eric is on wheels, rolling full- speed down steep hills and skitching onto the back of speeding trucks, the NASA guys somehow manage to keep up on foot. I swear they run five miles at speeds upward of 50 miles an hour. They get to Sears, meet up with Michael and the family van and finally head into the desert to reunite with Mac's family. Debbie shamelessly drops another candy commercial, \"Here, see if Mac likes these Skittles.\" *Passes the Skittles across the van, very slowly in front of the camera* Big shock, Mac likes Skittles. Already knew that. Sloppy writing. Anyway, the kids find the dessicated ruin of Mac's family near an abandoned mine shaft and revive them with jugs of cool water. Ha! Just kidding, they use Coke products. After dark, the kids' and aliens' luck finally runs out when the authorities catch up with them at a supermarket. In the ensuing m\u00eal\u00e9e, a fire is started and Eric is blown up and killed in an explosion. The alien family emerges from the fire and engage in a singsongy ritual that brings Eric back from the dead. It is unclear why they didn't give him a can of Coke. Missed opportunity.Our movie closes with a joyous courthouse scene as our alien friends are sworn in as US citizens. The dad alien never stops moving. He's constantly undulating like some kind of low-rent community theater mime. I wrote in my notes, \"It freaks me out and I hate it.\" That goes for the whole movie.",

Despite the obvious comparisons to Steven Spielberg's ' E.T. - The Extra Terrestrial ' and the much derided product placement of McDonald's and Coke, there is still much to recommend of this quirky and at times quite touching sci-fi adventure.The plot has an alien family sucked aboard a NASA space probe on Mars and accidentally brought back to Earth.  MAC ( Mysterious Alien Creature ), the mischievous alien child, is seperated from his family during the confusion of their arrival and stows away in the camper van of the Cruise family. The Cruise family are on their way to a new home in California, one which MAC singlehandedly proceeds to terrorize, his antics blamed on ten-year-old Eric.  Eric conspires to prove his innocence and capture MAC.  He befriends the lonely visitor and enlists the help of his teenage brother Michael ( Jonathan Ward ) and their friends Debbie ( Lauren Stanley ) and Courtney ( Tina Caspary ) to reunite him with his family whilst evading the authorities.Real life spina bifida sufferer Jade Calegory gives a wonderful performance as Eric and his friendship with MAC is rather sweet - MAC himself a wonderfully realised special effects creation, a fully mechanized robot.  Director Stewart Rafill manages to inject an even balance of humour and dramatic content into the movie and the top score by Alan Silvestri underlines this.There was a sequel intended for a summer 1989 release but negative reviews resulted in it being pulled.  A pity really as it would have been nice to see MAC and his family settle into life on Earth, and as there is no ' E.T. II ' for it to have been compared with, it would have given the filmmakers a chance to prove that MAC is pretty much his own character.",

It is CERTAINLY the best film of the year, and possibly one of the best films of the 80's.It tells a beguiling story of friendship, compassion, and undeniable warmth. What makes \"Mac & Me\" such a masterpiece is that it is able to (let's face it) rob a previous concept and make a bigger, bolder film out of it. This puts ET to shame.One of the film's best sequences is also its most heartbreaking one. MAC (mysterious alien creature)is found in tears is he mourns his missing family. Moments like this are what makes movies as strong as they are today.The first time I saw \"Mac & Me\", I expected a sappy over-sentimental film (ala The Right Stuff), but instead, I saw a blazing masterpiece of American cinema.

I liked it a lot as a kid so I have a bit of a nostalgia spot for it suppose. Before I end this I wanted to have a word on the dance party at McDonald's. It's not random as some people think it was because a girl was having her birthday party there. It was also my favorite part of the movie. Ten stars out of ten though it in reality it probably deserves 5.",

A movie so self aware that they named the alien after one of their biggest sponsors McDonalds. Technically it was financed by Gordon Food Services, the company that supplies McDonald's with their products, but it does star Ronald McDonald in one scene and McDonald's is mentioned many times in it so make of that what you will. You will also notice that other products make their way into this. Coke plays a huge role as being the only thing that people in this movie drink. Sears is the best store in the universe, so much so that the mother moves her family across the country to work at one. Skittles are shown prominently and has nothing at all to do with Reeses Pieces that were in that other alien movie. And for some reason Valvoline. Dunno why that one is there but maybe they needed a couple of oil changes.The movie starts when a bunch of creepy looking aliens discover a probe sent to Mars and are literally sucked up by it before they're returned to Earth. They're separated and little Mac, as he's known, winds up stowing away in a mini van to wind up with the people who's Mother works at Sears. Through a series of events little Mac tries to communicate with them, the boy in a wheelchair falls off a clip, there's a dance off at McDonalds and the power of Coke brings dying aliens back to life. Yes, this is as silly as it sounds.There is no redeeming feature for this. Although if you want a laugh, check out the dance contest going on at McDonald's it's hilarious.

Yes, it was probably made to capitalize on E.T., which is totally cynical.However...There is a part of me that wants to defend this movie because unlike most movies about disabled kids, this one refuses to push an ableist narrative about his disability. The hero of this film is a kid in a wheelchair, but the plot doesn't really revolve around this aspect of him, nor does it end with the sickening idea that the only reason to feature a disabled character is so he can get up and walk again and be \"like normal people\" eventually. In this regard, Mac and Me was 30 years ahead of its time.This is all of course to say nothing of the message this movie sends to non-disabled kids-which is simply that disability changes nothing about your character. And that's *such* a good, important message to send.Also, I could see myself as a kid enjoying this movie in spite of its flaws (even though I first saw it as a teenager, and then only because I was a bad movie buff and had heard how awful it was). It's nowhere near the level of E.T., but it manages to be kind of fun and silly in its own way. And who says a movie has to be a deep, meaningful experience? What's wrong with escapism for its own sake? And if an escapist movie can send a good message about disability along the way, all the better.",

            "content": "There's a metaphor somewhere in this lame science fiction comedy where an extraterrestrial ends up getting sucked up into an Electrolux, attachments included. This film isn't just bad. It's tedious and unfunny and boring and bad. Poor Christine Ebersole is wasted as the mother, settling into a new house which gets turned upside down by the presence of something that looks like a melted rubber tree plant. Thia film tries to be sweet, but sometimes sweetness can be overwhelming and bring on cavities and diabetes. They overdo it with the musical score, shots of various product placement and the presence of a handicapped boy that's supposed to automatically force the audience to feel sorry for him. I have no problem with the acting of the kids. They do as they are directed to do, and they are realistic, but unfortunately the rip-off of a masterpiece is not only blatant, but six years too late, and with E. T. at the time not yet on VHS, desperate for product placement and advertising dollars from some not quite healthy food and beverage products.The neighborhood where this takes place looks exactly like the neighborhood where E. T. took place too, so that's another minus. The movie is an example of proof that movie studios don't always have their target audience's best interests in mind, and since 8 year old kids would have been only toddlers when E. T. came out, they would obviously know nothing about it when their parents drop them off with their older siblings while they went grocery shopping on a Saturday afternoon. And it's not just the ripping off of a classic, it's the fact that the film is cloying from the start. One or two moments had my complete attention (such as when the kid flies off of a cliff early in the film in his wheelchair yet manages to survive), but 99.9% of the film just gavs me eyerolls.I've avoided this film for more than 30 years (having gotten the scoop about how bad it was from video store customers I waited on), and pretty much everything they've said and everything I've read about this film is true. Ebersole, one of my favorite stage actresses, gets through this with her dignity, but the child actors, now adults, most likely got ridiculed in school when the lack of success of the film resulted in a complete humiliation for the producers and creators. It tries too hard to be hip in that late 80's way, and falls flatter than a fast-food breakfast tray.",

That alone rings alarm bells, but the movie turns out to be even worse than what you are properly expecting. As you probably know, the movie is a blatant rip-off of \"E.T.\", so much so that it's a shock that Steven Spielberg and Universal Pictures did not sue. But the plagiarism wouldn't be all that bad had the movie been executed with enough skill and heart. However, the movie fails in every way you can think of, from the stiff-faced and unexpressive aliens to the human characters coming across as unbelievably stupid. And yes, the many blatant product plugs are pretty shameful. With the original \"E.T.\" movie being freely available, there is no reason to see this shoddy rip-off in its original version.

            "content": "First off I'd like to state that haven't seen this film since 1990 on HBO. But even the trailers warned of doom. When the trailer isn't narrated by Don LaFontaine but by Ronald McDonald (not kidding) you know this film isn't even trying to be taken seriously! 'Mac and Me' was obviously trying to exploit the phenomenal success of 'E.T.' which remained playing in theaters for over 3 years into 1984! But it was only available on VHS in bootleg format until 1989. Hence, in 1988 there was a void that needed to be filled. America was E.T.less until 'Mac and Me.' Well first off this film isn't nearly as bad as everyone says. It's just rightfully one of the most hated films of all time because it's such an obvious rip off of 'E.T.'!!! Right down to scene by scene! Not kidding, some scenes are identical to 'E.T.' like the G men chasing the school kids.It's pointless to describe the plot because it's exactly like 'E.T.'!!! I can't stress this enough! From how the boy meets the alien to how the single mom finds out her sons have been hiding it, it's exactly like 'E.T.' Except not good. But not really that bad.Imagine if the Lifetime network was given the screenplay for 'E.T.' rather than Steven Spielberg.The cartoonish action violence is also WAY over done. Sure E.T. himself took some Tom & Jerry style blows but here poor Mac gets the full Ren & Stimpy treatment. Getting sucked through vacuum cleaners more than once and getting bounced off car windshields.If all this is supposed to be comical, it's NOT. Poor Mac is like the Wiley Coyote of cute aliens.The only other difference is that this time Elliot is in a wheelchair. This way McDonald's which produced the film can boast about how the Ronald McDonald House helps the families of crippled kids.In conclusion I can think of no reason to watch this film other than the fact that 'E.T.'s Blue Ray release has been totally bastardized by new shoddy CGI FX and reedited to be more friendly. Such as removing the G men's hand guns and changing some dialogue. WHY? 'E.T.' was perfect! Just leave it the fxxx alone! Once again the clear solution to this problem is to simply watch a bootleg VHS of 'E.T.'",

If you want to watch a film which is supposed to be serious but might just having you in ironical stitches of laughter because it is so bad, then yes. If you want to watch this as a serious film and think that it is a good alternative to \"E. T.\" then keep moving. If you want to suspend your disbelief without getting angry and wanting to throw something at the TV, then this isn't a good idea. This film doesn't have many redeeming features and there is a reason that various film forums rank this in the top 10 worst films not just of the 1980's, but of all time. I didn't enjoy watching this in the 1980's when I was a child - I haven't enjoyed re-watching it 30+ years later. If I live out the rest of my life and don't watch this film again, it's been a good life - sorry, that's harsh, but I really didn't/don't like this.",

There's Mortuary, Terror Vision, Demons, Grizzly or Bloody Birthday. But look what came in the mail today - Mac And Me.There were Halloween scenes in E. T., right?Let the frightmare begin.Movie starts out on Planet Zeebes, you know, Super Metroid? Never mind. Some Xtro creatures, cousins to Eiffel 65's blue martians, are fracking for underground resources.Oh no! 1-minute and 49 seconds in and the boom mike is in frame! Serious?Some Mars landrover lands from nowhere and the Tusken Raiders pop-up curious as Back to the Future music plays and I swear I heard Gremlins noises earlier.I bet they filmed this out at Area 52, right? (You aren't aware there's an Area 52, are you?)These Mega Anorexic Creatures have the same stillborn facial expression as Octaman.So a family of Mac's are slurped up into a Rover vacuum and return to Earth.I bet that Richard Crenna steps out of this Rambo helicopter.If this is a kid's movie that alien escape scene was quite scary then. I found that cornfield scene in E. T. quite frightening as well as a kid.There's a special guest appearance by The Stuff which causes gridlock enabling the baby Mac to escape with a family who are unaware of a stowaway onboard.There's a pitiful scene at the 13:58 mark, (which I rewound,) it's part Star Wars, cross Platoon, meets Neil Breen's I am Here... Now. The pathetic display of misery almost reduced me to tears.I can hear the Back to the Future score in this movie. So a baby alien hitches a ride with a family to California, they move in one street away from Elliots. Elsewhere the 3 other creepy nomad aliens walk around aimlessly looking like the Blair Witch 2 in Leatherface's skin.Hold that thought. I'm rewinding this wheelchair water diving scene. It reminds me of something I saw in that Onion movie.They're making a classic movie error - they're showing too much of the killer, I mean baby alien.I didn't know dogs could burn rubber.The baby alien grows attached to the boy (E. T.) while the other 3 creepy Mac's perform rituals out in the Nevada desert trying to channel a Heavens Gate warp zone.How many movies was the Griswolds family truckster in?Love this mean street Seers gang ripping off Ozone's breakin' dance routine. Fat Boy Slim stole the same moves in one of his videos, too.How can these G-men not be impressed with the killers, I mean aliens, McDonald's dance party? There is energy and enthusiasm and even Ronald McDonald's pelvis is moving.There's a touching scene with a van; wild horses, and an uplifting power ballad all mashed together as it gives hope for a new day where you know that there a better times ahead for our tiny little killer, I mean alien. What hope and inspiration! It's the sort of stuff that can make legless people walk again! I'm gonna strive to be a better person because of that scene right there. I'm enlightened - this movie has heart. I am emotionally filled with elation largely thanks to that creepy half-dying Cola revival scene as the killer is reunited with the 3 other cult members.Is this ever gonna finish? I thought it was over.The Heavens Gate aliens do an armed robbery, steal groceries, have a shootout with local sheriffs, a convenience store explodes, kid dies in the crossfire, aliens get away with the loot, have a change of heart, self immolate, walk through fire, then resurrect the dead boy like the exorcist with faith healing witchcraft techniques as R2-D2 beeps approval in the background.As a reward for committing all these heinous crimes the cult member aliens are given U. S. citizenship.If you thought The Beverly Hillbillies moving into California was creepy get a load at the end of this one.I wasn't expecting much with this watered-down version of E. T. but surprisingly it held its own and made me laugh out loud a few times.It's good clean fun, I guess.",

Even the aliens were drinking Cokes! Then there was a very strange and unfortunate dance sequence at the local McDonalds that didn't seem to really make much sense, either. Long story short, where were the screen writers and the director trying to take us? As many folks have pointed out already, ET is not even a distant cousin of this film. It was way better and far more realistic. (Believable). Sears made a few appearances along with Skittles, Volkswagen, and Ford, to name a few. What I found most laughable was the end, but I will save that for anyone who wished to watch this (fast forwarding to the end of the movie would be your best bet) so they can the true nature of stupid in a motion picture. Oh yea, a few amusing scenes in the movie where when the little girl from next door takes a trip across the floor, up the wall, across the ceiling and back down the opposite wall. The person looked pretty fake and the track for the vacuum was extremely obvious. The scene with the little goofball alien in a toy car going down the street with all the dogs chasing him was a rather strange departure from the film. I guess my biggest problem was that nothing in this film made any real sense. It was 90 mins of foolishness that really shouldn't have been made. It cost 13 million dollars to make this movie and it barely made back 45% of that in ticket sales. Maybe Coca-cola and McDonalds should have thought a little harder about where to put their money. For me at least, since Coke cans kept turning up in the movie, especially where you wouldn't expect them to be, this was more like a lengthy Coke commercial.",

So of course the cinematography is well done, the music is excellent, the actors do the best they could have done with the script they were given.

Blood Frenzy is 100% garbage and it's proud of it. A C-Movie that is terrible and cheap in every way, and was probably filmed in one day somewhere out in the desert.Now, back to Mac and ME. There's no way to get around the script - it's a turkey. A movie can only be as good as its script, simple as that. If Stanley Kubrick or Alfred Hitchcock had directed, it still would have been a turkey. The script is everything. The comments above have, if you like, been \"divorced\" from the two most repulsive facts regarding this movie: the ET rip-off, which is obvious, and the shameless product promotion. Not sure how much of the $30,000,000 came from Mickey Ds, Coca-Cola, and Skittles, but I imagine a large portion. These two unfortunate facts notwithstanding, it's not as bad as people say.

After years of Barney and teletubbies, Mac and Me is real genius.  I heard that Mac and me was sponsored by McDonalds to help benefit the Ronald McDonald house, so I can look past the low budget.  Another 80's movie we have recently come to love is Explorers with River Phoenix.",

Whoever put this pile of trash on the big (and little) screens should be VERRRRY ashamed of themselves. How the HECK didn't the creators of E. T. not win themselves a HUGE LAWSUIT by suing the PANTS off the thieves that put this (cough cough) movie together???? If you are even THINKING of watching this dumpster fire,I am warning you now...just step away from the Blu-Ray or DVD player now. You will thank me for telling you this.

The whacky completely inexplicable \"racoon scene\" where, as filler between scenes, we get to watch a racoon knock over a trash can. (why?? who cares).Mac \"swimming\" to the rescue warranted a chuckle - very Prince of Tides with the view from below as he swims past.Then the \"Wacky D's\" dance routine is worth the cost of the video rental itself.It's been year's since I watched but I'm ready to see it again.",

This one was trying to be funny and I don't think I laughed once.I give all the actors credit for being very attractive to watch and also being good actors in the roles played. If it wasn't for them I could not have made it to the end of this muddled and extremely cheesy story.It is extremely difficult to make aliens believable in a movie like this. Opening the movie with the aliens was not subtle. The production team seemed to LOVE overexposing the audience with their alien creations, which I believe were actual people in body suits?I heard about and was interested in seeing the scene at McDonald's, 55 minutes into the movie. It was even more bizarre than I expected. I also did not realize this would be the cheesiest product placement film ever! I believe E. T. was the first to advertise a product in a movie in 1982 with Reese's Pieces. They went ALL OUT in this movie and COKE was used in a similar manner to Reeses Pieces, even to the point of saying \"This must be like what they drink on their planet\".Overall, it was not that enjoyable of a movie for me. I hope the actors were able to recover from it.",

            "content": "(Hell if Kraft had chipped in the money for production that probably WOULD be the title.)I could give a detailed review of the whole movie, but come on, people, the premise alone (a 90 minute orgy of corporate synergism disguised as an ET ripoff) would be sufficient enough to inform you that this was junk. (Besides, many other reviewers have already highlighted some of Mac and Me's most ridiculous scenes.) Indeed all I have to do is simply describe the mind-boggling ending to showcase why this is loathsome junk.SPOILERS:In an effort to tug at our heartstrings (to the point of almost yanking them out of our chests) the filmmakers kill off the cripple kid (Jade Calegory) in a giant raging explosion that would give Michael Bay multiple orgasms. To indicate that this is \"poignant\" the cast pretends to cry, with Mama Cripple (Christine Ebersol) surprisingly doing the least effective job of mourning. Of course she was only mildly upset when he prop-dummied his way off a cliff, so maybe she too is secretly hoping to not to put up with her boy's lameness. Not to worry! The hideous alien family (who kinda caused the explosion in the first place) reveal they're apparently fireproof and do a laying of hands and demonstrates a previously unannounced and oddly coincidental healing power and rats...I mean \"huzzah!\" Eric the handi-capable kid is healed! (Well not his legs because these aliens kinda suck. Maybe if they had utilized the healing properties in DELICIOUS THIRST-QUENCHING COCA-COLA?) Incidentally the fire is still roaring out of control right next to our stars and no one is rushing an almost roasted Eric to a hospital or anything. But who cares? Anyone want any Skittles?Then we transition to a new day where the two evil military/government stooges that have been chasing Mac and his family throughout the whole movie are eagerly rushing somewhere. Where are they going in such a hurry? Why they're going to an immigrant naturalization ceremony where MAC and his equally repulsive family ARE BEING SWORN IN AS FULL CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES OF America! All the characters from the movie are clapping along happily, even the ones who were enemies until just a few minutes ago. I'm sure many viewers jaws' were dropping at this seemingly inexplicable plot twist (especially since the aliens dressed like some parody of a 50's sitcom family all of a sudden), but it makes perfect sense with the movie's ultimate Aesop: There is nothing more \"All- American\" then stuffing yourself full of high-fructose corn syrup and buying cheap consumer products (awwwwww! Heartwarming stuff, ain't it?) I mean sure these disgusting space turds don't understand that stealing precious, precious Coke at gunpoint is, you know, \"bad\", but their fanatical pursuit of brand-name foodstuff just makes them the ideal Black Friday shopper.Besides the TRULY cringe-worthy moment doesn't begin into just before the credits roll. Not only do we have to endure some Celine-wannabe and her overwrought caterwauling (the filmmakers clearly meant for this to be their \"Oscar-bait\" song), but the film officially ends with the aliens driving down the freeway (???) with a cartoon bubble saying \"We'll be back!\" What amazing gall! The people who put this atrocity together seriously had so little respect for their audience that rather then being embarrassed for unleashing this desperate money-grubbing dreck, they thought this would be successful enough for franchising, because hey, the people who'd we want as customers and fans aren't smart enough to want things like quality, right? They're just dumb easily-exploitable marks who's buy any crap we try to sell them right? Boy am I glad they were proved wrong.",

This movie is infamously awful and sadly it brings down ET's overall quality just by its own existence but at least \"Mac And Me\" owns it. Similar to other \"so-bad-they're-good\" movies like \"The Room\", Mac And Me knows that it's bad and knows that it's a rip-off of family classic ET, but here's the thing folks. Mac And Me doesn't care at all what you think of it. Where ET had moments of a beautiful friendship, Mac And Me had insensitive stereotypes. Where ET pulled at heart-strings and left viewers in tears, Mac And Me has a 8 minute dance sequence in a McDonald's restaurant. (by the way, the main character is in a wheelchair and forced to just watch as all his friends and Mac in a bear costume are dancing and having a good time. How rude!)This movie is bad, yes, there's no denying that. But you know when we get a bad sci-fi movie, we also get a great MST3K episode covering it (which is actually how I discovered Mac And Me)",

            "content": "This movie was rated as the worst ever, but I thought is was done quite well. You'd have to think of the target audience: Eighties kids, teenagers. They didn't mind the clumsy muppet play, it's a compelling story at a nice pace. A family of aliens gets taken from god knows where, could be a moon of Saturn by the looks of it, back to Earth by an automated NASA explorer spacecraft. They get into a big turmoil at the NASA base, but escape in the confusion. The youngest one gets separated and lands with a family which is just moving in the state. After that, things indeed look somewhat like E.T. There are folks here saying it is all stolen from E.T., well that must be true, though there wasn't anything really reminding me of ET - it is only when I consciously compare the scripts, certain things look similar. There were some really weird things yes like the obvious referring to McDonalds (must be a sponsor), Coca Cola as the beverage of choice for the aliens - it even brought them back to life. the McDonalds scene is pretty weird but hey - nobody said this movie shouldn't be. Dancers all around, even on the parking lot, freaking out on a kids party - Ronald McDonald is there too. The funniest goof is when the waitress hands out empty cups with straws, one falls on the ground, the younger girl picks it up - they didn't even bother to redo that scene, probably because it was a ridiculous scene anyway. Finally, all ends brilliantly, the aliens adept really well, and become true Americans!The acting, screenplay, music and general production were of genuine B- movie quality. Only the special effects were not as good as one would expect in production with a reasonable budget like this one. Bud kids, in the time of the release, weren't that picky like they are now in this 3d animated era. Did I find this movie entertaining? Surprisingly, yes I did!",
