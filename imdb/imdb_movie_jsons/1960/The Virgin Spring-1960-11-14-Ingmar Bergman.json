            "content": "The picture is set in Sweden , during the Dark Ages , 14th-century . This the story about a young naive virgin named Karin (Petterson) who's sent by her parents (Max Von Sidow and Birgitta Valverg )towards a church to hand over candles for the holy Virgin . She's accompanied by Inger (Gunner Lindblon) , a pregnant and envious young . They meet a group of peasants and the young virgin is cruelly raped (whose images in some countries were rated \u00a8R\u00a8). Later on , the killers ask for help and shelter from the parents .The movie displays haunting and powerful scenes , it's plenty of images which stay forever in mind . Although it is sometimes slow moving ; however , the thoughtful screenplay is narrated with intelligence and sensitivity but here are developed ethic and moral issues just like death , God , religion and vengeance . The movie realizes an excellent reunion of Swedish actors with usual Bergman's players (Sidow and Lindblon , among others), showing the different characters and exploring their apprehensions , ambitions , fears and circumstances . Glimmer and riveting cinematography by Sven Nykvist (he won an Oscar for Fanny and Alexander) , he's deemed by many to be one of the world's greatest cameramen , he achieved give the movies on the most natural and simplest look imaginable , he replaced Gunner Fischer (The seventh seal) as Bergman's cinematographer . He continued an American career working for Louis Malle (Pretty baby) ,Bob Fosse (Star 80) ,Philipp Kauffman (The unbearable lightness of being) and Woody Allen (Another woman , Crimen and misdemeanors). \u00a8The Virgin spring\u00a8 was wonderfully directed by Bergman , it's a real masterpiece who made his major impact gaining international acclaim and winning an Oscar to the best foreign film and a Gloden Globe . His realization was during his impressive golden period from 1957-1968 , when Bergman (recently deceased) made stunning masterpieces : The seventh seal , Persona , The communicants , The silence , Hour of Wolf . Rating : Magnificent , but it is considered by many (along with The seventh seal) to be the Bergman's best . And please to forget the horrible and \u00a8Sui generis\u00a8 version made by Wes Craven titled \u00a8The last house on the left\u00a8 .",

            "content": "A powerhouse piece of filmmaking from one of the all-time great directors. This 14th-century exploration of good and evil, morality and chaos, love and revenge is pretty much a faultless viewing experience and one which retains its ability to shock and provoke thought in the viewer even today. I can only imagine what it would have been like to see this on first release.The story is deceptively simple and yet filled with harrowing imagery. The assault in the woods is difficult to watch, even in these jaded times, and of course Bergman wrings the maximum tension out of it right from the very beginning. The second half is, perhaps, even more tense, with the expectation of impending violence and the strong, subtle filmmaking techniques (think: lots of lurking shadow, religious iconography, haunted faces). The excellent use of black and white photography reminded me of Kurosawa's work on RASHOMON. Max von Sydow holds it all together as the brusque father and family man, but he heads a cast who can do no wrong.Wes Craven went for a lurid, contemporary remake in LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, but despite the graphic nature of Craven's film I don't think it holds a candle to this one.",

            "content": "A landmark film from master filmmaker Ingmar Bergman that still remains potent today, \"The Virgin Spring\" understandably won the Best Foreign Film Oscar for its year. Haunting and unforgettable, it's pull of literate dialogue, attempting to ask some hard questions when it comes to good and evil, and faith and religion. Even at the end, the film does make clear the message that even with vengeance comes a price to pay.The luminous Birgitta Pettersson plays Karin, the lovely & virginal daughter of a farming couple (Max von Sydow, Birgitta Valberg). The striking Gunnel Lindblom plays Ingeri, the pregnant wild child whom they've taken in. One day, the two girls set off to transport some candles to church, and the nearest church is a LONG ways away. During the journey, Birgitta makes the acquaintance of two travelling herdsmen (Axel Duberg, Tor Isedal) and their much younger \"brother\" (Ove Porath). The two young men rape and murder poor Karin, and as luck would have it, they find shelter and food at the nearest abode: the von Sydow and Valberg household. Once the two parents put two and two together, they're ripe for revenge.Shot in gorgeous black & white by the great Sven Nykvist, \"The Virgin Spring\" will attract curious viewers if they are like this viewer and are horror fans who have already seen the crude and crass Wes Craven reimagining, \"The Last House on the Left\". Inevitably, comparisons will be made; while each version is quite memorable in their own way, this film retains the power to shock and depress despite cinema becoming progressively more graphic as the years have gone by.The performances are excellent. Pettersson is such an appealing presence that it's gut-wrenching what happens to her. Von Sydow is his usual tower of strength as the father who learns that vengeance is not all it's cracked up to be. Duberg and Isedal may not quite make one want to take a bath afterwards the way that Krug and company did in Cravens' film, but they're still sufficiently creepy.Vivid and credible, this does leave its viewers with some things to think about afterwards, and offers no easy answers.Inspired by a 13th century Swedish ballad, and scripted by Ulla Isaksson.Eight out of 10.",

            "review_title": "The Virgin Spring (1960) ****",
            "content": "Now, this was a true work of art. A quietly designed yet devastating story of a religious Medieval family and how their faith becomes challenged when their young daughter is brutally raped and murdered by three derelict brothers. Max von Sydow plays the father who is a God-fearing believer, yet finds himself overcome by his own sweet desire for revenge against those who wronged his little girl. I am happy to say I appreciated Ingmar Bergman's genius just by this movie alone. It's a visually beautiful piece to look at, but also with a story and strong convictions. So much is said without really needing to go overboard. I can see there is a recurring theme in his work where he questions the existence of God, or at least the complicated ways in which God works things out on Earth. I'm not sure whether Bergman was a full-blooded atheist or not at this point but I'd suspect he was at least a questioning agnostic. I'm sure this is partly why Woody Allen is so enamored with the director, as a similar religious thread runs through some of Allen's own movies. For the record, I am a strong believer in God, though these days I too have been faced with personal issues which have had me having difficulties in understanding, much like the father of THE VIRGIN SPRING. So this movie also touches a personal nerve within me. The performances here are all first-rate, with a special nod to Birgitta Petterson as the friendly and generous young woman who we take an instant liking to, but becomes the victim. What more can I say? An exceptional and deeply-moving film. **** out of ****",

            "content": "Legendary Swedish director, Ingmar Bergman's probable precursor to Wes Craven's notorious 1972 shocker 'The Last House on the Left' is a far more compelling and emotionally draining film that adroitly and continuously switches the viewers sentiments up until the despondent, tranquil and haunting ending. While one minute the viewer is laughing along with the youthful, if na\u00efve, exuberance of the young Karin (Birgitta Petterssen), the following minute will encourage different emotions as Bergman plunges the viewer into the middle of a nightmarish crime perpetrated by nothing less than the evil inside man. Although the portrayals of the acts committed in 'The Virgin Spring' are far less graphic than the modern viewer may have become accustomed to, they still retain an immense power to horrify as one cannot ignore the great lengths Bergman has gone to in order to give his characters a base in order to harden the impact of what we see. With just the simplest of dialogue, the viewer continues to learn about the relationships and personalities of each of the characters so that we may appreciate the consequences and, in some ways, forgive the actions that we see. This film is, after all, a tale of morality and repentance and therefore, even while in some cases the actions may be evil, it is necessary to accept the goodness that is still there. This thought is made no clearer than during the solemn and subdued final scene which fades out abruptly and leaves the viewer in a state of quiet reflection.Bergman's pacing and subtle direction which at one point leaves the viewer in suspense for what seems like an eternity is surely the reason for the greatness of this film. As if he were playing chess, he manipulates not only the characters, but the emotions of the viewers with intelligent and surprising maneuvers while pressing home his own sentiments regarding the story so that we may at least take into great consideration the events that we have seen. Bergman has an amazing ability to flip the atmosphere of a movie in a split second using various lighting and camera angle techniques as well as motivating his performers to follow suit. The simple expression changes on the faces of Birgitta Petterssen, Max von Sydow, Birgitta Valberg and Gunnel Lindblom at various points throughout the film quickly alter the mindset of the viewer and indicate that all is not well; so beautiful in undeniable simplicity.'The Virgin Spring' is nothing short of a masterpiece and a film that few will be able to forget. 9\u00bd/10",

            "review_title": "Bergman Unintentionally Unleashes a New Wave of Horror",
            "content": "Karin (Birgitta Pettersson) is the spoiled child, doted on by her mother -- spared the rod and well-pampered. Her father tries to be stern, but can't help but laugh when she offers to lie to the priest (despite the family being very religious). She remains innocent like a child half her age.The servant girl, Ingeri (who is noticeably darker than the fair Karin), has become pregnant with a bastard child and taunts Karin, insisting she, too, will give in to men when one makes a move. This story is taken from the traditional tale \"T\u00f6res dotter i W\u00e4nge\" with surprising accuracy.Bosley Crowther of the New York Times says this is \"a straight equating of violence and revenge, of brutality and compassion\", and that \"Bergman has stocked it with scenes of brutality that, for sheer unrestrained realism, may leave one sickened and stunned.\" Crowther, who finds the plot overly simplistic, says \"the conflict is simply and clearly what it probably was in that age\u2014between the pagan urge to have vengeance and the Christian will to forgive.\" On that last point, I think there is more to be said. For one thing, it is odd to have a Christian morality tale from an atheist director. If the conflict is simply pagan versus Christian, how does Christian morality win in an atheist's tale? Methinks there is something more afoot.Ivan Butler believes that the \"horror is in the revenge more than in the original wrong.\" I disagree. The murder of rapists cannot be seen as more vile than the rape and murder of a young girl. He also suggests that \"the father's fury may be partly motivated by an incestuous affection for his daughter\", though this claim has very little support, in my opinion.Most reviews will focus on the film's brutality. While the violence is strong at times, it seems to dance on the line without crossing over into glamorization. And for any modern film-goer, there shouldn't be anything here that hasn't been seen before, for better or worse.This story went on to be remade by Wes Craven as horror revenge film \"Last House on the Left\"... and then remade again. It has become something of a perennial revenge tale.",

The killers unknowingly asked for the shelter at her parents' house... One of three was a young boy who only watched the crime.Max von Sydow gives one of his best performances as an outraged father. Ingmar Bergman and his genius cinematographer Swen Nykwist reconstructed the medieval world full of realities and life, stunningly beautiful and deadly dangerous in the same time. Certainly a masterpiece and one of my favorite Bergman's films after the repeat viewing. Powerful simplicity.",

            "content": "Pauline Kael (who she? They cry in unison) denounced this stunning film as revolting and the subject matter is harrowing and explicit for it's day. Just because it is, doesn't mean the story, although a legend; is not worth telling. The murdered girl is just like a dear friend of mine so it's particularly distressing to sit through. I can see where Tarkovsky got his floating pollen from, or maybe both he and Bergman were influenced by Dreyer. Great scenes include the guilty boy staring up at the stars while a grandfather torments him with a speech about conscience and the cruelty of the heavens, and Sydow's stabbing of one of his daughter's killers. It happens unsparingly in front of the camera, and is absolutely searing and indelibly imprints itself upon the memory, as it shows the slow, hard reality of taking a man's life from him. Sydow is also superlative after he has killed the child and stares down at his hands, unable to reconcile them as being his own. He brilliantly conveys a man who expected to be rewarded for his virtuous life in service of the lord and his bitterness over God's perceived betrayal. Or is it about betraying ones self?\nBergman admitted that the ending with the spring was somewhat tacked on and over didactic, even bogus, as he had already said what he had wanted to say on the matter of religion in previous films and that the matter was 'closed' in his mind to a certain extent. Perhaps this is why Kael questioned whether the film really needed to exist. I can't answer that one but it is a film of authority and power which makes you question what you would do in similar circumstances, and how you might reconcile your actions with your faith. Leaving aside the religious issue, which Bergman does appear to be half hearted about, it unquestionably sides itself with the need for forgiveness and the moral duty to do good. Recommended, and great performances.",

The film is not just a stark study of the cruelty and superstition of the Middle Ages but also a very powerful revenge story that is dripping with symbolism, though not too much to overshadow the storytelling. The story may be bleak, this is often considered one of Bergman's bleakest and most hard-hitting films, but always compelling and moving, the ending especially is miraculous. As ever with Bergman, The Virgin Spring is superbly directed and very atmospherically photographed(I did have difficulty believing that this was Sven Nykvist's first collaboration with Bergman, and I mean that as a compliment). It also has a haunting score and a thought-provoking screenplay. The scene with Karin being murdered is harrowing, and I think it really stays with you. The acting also has a lot of intensity, I especially want to single out Max Von Sydow, who is magnetic in presence and equally telling in his facial expressions. Overall, a brilliant film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "I have to agree with the previous comment, this is certainly a sad film I would go further, it's actually a grim little tale. Bergman pulls no punches, the medaeval world he shows is a hard, harsh, bleak place. There is a sense of menace in almost every scene and the actual rape is graphic and nearly unwatchable. The characters are not finely drawn, but after all this is a fairy tale in the older mould. They are there to represent types and conditions. The sad, doting mother; the unbending Christian gentleman; the flawed cleric; the ferocious, deceitful rapist-murderers. The tale on one level is very simple and can be simply followed; jealous sister curses more favoured sister, favoured sister is cruelly killed, killers ironically claim refuge of her father, father exacts revenge on them. So far we have something that could have come out of many a European ballad tradition. However, on another level it contains fundamental comments on humanity and human behaviour, Christian moral theology and our reaction to it. The father's faith is tested, he is not the man he thinks he is and his religion is not what he thinks it is either, though he submits and adopts a position of blind hope. The killers represent the complete absence of good that Aquinas maintained was the definition of evil. The young brother is the pain of conscience. In many ways it is a play on the deadly sins, apart from gluttony they are all there; wrath on the part of the father and pride in his daughter; envy in the half-sister; lust and avarice in the herdsmen and so on. It is truly an exemplary tale, as a medaeval legend should be. I bought this film casually at a street stall in Taipei for an absurdly small amount of money and it lay on a shelf unwatched for quite some time. In a bored moment one night I slipped it in the player and found myself enthralled until the finish. The cinematography, of course, is excellent but the joy is the dark threat that filigrees it, the simple but powerful emotions both quietly and violently displayed. It lacks the grandeur of \"The Seventh Seal\". It's a smaller and more compact number but it some ways the better for it, the evocations are more direct and the violence unnerving. I recommend it very highly indeed, you will be thinking on its themes long after this simple little tale finishes.",

This was my second viewing of this film and it was certainly better this second time even though I loved it on the first viewing. As I said last year, Wes Craven's The Last House on the Left and the Italian shocker House on the Edge of the Park ripped this film off quite heavily and went over the top with graphic violence, gore, nudity and everything else imaginable yet these cheap shock thrills can't hold a candle to this film. This is masterfully directed and contains so much power that very few directors could have pulled it off. The eerie and haunting rape scene is very casual yet contains extreme power. The revenge sequence as well as the conclusion are also very subtle but pack a wonderful punch. I think it was a great choice for these scenes to play out without the use of a music score. This really helps the bitterness and creepiness of the film. A perfect atmosphere and brilliant performances really push this film over the top. von Sydow doesn't say much here but his acting with his eyes and body jesters are priceless.",

            "content": "The Virgin Spring is a film so graceful, subtle and omniscient that when we experience powerfully emotional moments, we haven't even expected them, and when we have, it's already hit us. With every detail of every department, the result is utter simplicity, utter docility, no fluctuation in the face of whatever brutality or emotional quakes, making them all that much more profoundly moving. The story reveals and illustrates the characters up until the fatal flaw causes the end of the movie to be inevitable, but we never saw that particular element that way, because everything is utterly natural.Its pitch-perfect genuine bloom is the effect of the film being pared down to its barest intentions. And these are not only fundamental questions, but fundamental questions in a time and place in history where needs and desires were purely fundamental. The characters, existing in medieval Sweden, could have no concept of how complicated human beings' intentions could be as they are in modern times. It begins with a prosperous Christian whose daughter, Karin played by Birgitta Pattersson, is appointed to bring candles to the church. This is a big deal around here. Karin is accompanied by her pregnant foster sister, Ingeri played by Gunnel Lindblom, who secretly worships a Norse pagan God. What conflict! What happens from there, I will not say. But anywhere you may read about this film you will see that it was the basis for Wes Craven's exploitation flick The Last House on the Left, but in that exploitation of a genuine bloom of grace, the ensuing turning points in the plot achieve the exact opposite effect in every way I've explained. When you see The Virgin Spring, you will be presented with people who search for the same answers and consolations most of us still seek today. Even if a viewer would sooner find themselves watching Craven's film than anything by Ingmar Bergman, once they would get around to The Virgin Spring, they'd find themselves subjected to an unexpected, and wholly memorable, experience more rare than the later film.Max Von Sydow's performance is truly unforgettable in every sense of the word, burning every line of his ultimate soliloquy into you with an impact lasting longer than the movie or the day you see it. He is a giant, unabashedly masculine yet incapable of artifice. Even so, he stands out no more than any other actor, all of whom beautifully share the screen with one another, which emboldens the impact of where his character goes.Ulla Isakkson's story yields a multitude of moral examinations in our minds. There are certain peculiar characters who have no human sympathy and are unashamed of a laundry list of barbarities. Bergman shows the Christian Orthodox family spending every waking moment preoccupied with purity, altruism and decency in the eyes of the god they passionately look to with faith that the world they live in is inherently good and just. Their concept of evil is the notion of a Pagan god. How are they to act when crossing paths with the former set of characters?",

She is the pride and joy of her family. On the day of Our Lady of Virgins, her father asks her to go to a distant church with her pregnant stepsister and carry some candle for Our Lady. On the way through the woods, the naive girl leaves her stepsister resting in a small farm and continues her journey alone. She meets three shepherd brothers and invites them to share her food. Then, they rape and kill her, under the eyes of her hidden stepsister. In the same night, the three brothers arrive and look for shelter in her home. The revenge of her father is very impressive. A miracle happens in the end of the story. This film is really a masterpiece. But it is also one of the saddest film I have ever seen. The story is very simple, but the direction and the performance of the cast is outstanding. I dare to say that this is a perfect movie. In the end of the story, I had tears on my face. Ingmar Bergman is one of my favorite directors and I was very sorry for not having the chance to watch 'The Virgin Spring'. This movie was not available on VHS in Brazil. However, three months ago, the Brazilian distributor Vers\u00e1til released a restored DVD, with wonderful image and sound. Two days ago, I bought an Ingmar Berman box with four restored DVDs, and today I have had the chance and the pleasure of finally see this film. I am a fan of this distributor, specialized mainly in art movies. In Brazil, DVD is something very special for persons like me, who loves and collects movies. Many excellent films are now being released in Brazil due to the advent of the DVD. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'A Fonte da Donzela' ('The Fountain of the Maiden' \u2013 the free translation is slightly different from 'The Virgin Spring')",

            "review_title": "Fatherly Vengeance",
            "content": "(There are Spoilers) More then just a story about a fathers revenge for the brutal rape-murder of his only child it's also about the clash of Christian and Norse & Pagan beliefs in 14th century Sweden. This act of fatherly vengeance is reflected in Tore, Max Von Sydow, a hard working and Christian farmer. Strict in his rock hard beliefs Tore's and his sweet and kindly wife Maretas Christian ideas have been instilled since childhood on his sweet and virgin teen-age daughter Karin,Brigitta Pettersson, the apple of Tore's eye. Being Easter it's traditional for the youngest daughter in one's family to go to the local church and deliver hand-made candles for the holiday and Karin is more then eager to go. Dressed in her best and expensive Sunday clothes Karin rides off to the local church, a good many miles away, and insists that her step sister Ingeri, Gunnei Lindblom, come along. Ingeri the black sheep of the family had always resented Karin for her sweet and unspoiled beauty as well as her not allowing herself to be seduced, like Ingeri was. Karin is always pleasant and friendly to the many boys in and around town who make a play for her but not giving into them when it came to going beyond the traditional, and Christian, good night kiss after an evening of dancing and socializing. It this very kindly trait on Karin's part that later in the movie leads to her brutal murder. As both Karin and Ingeri go on their way to the church a fight erupts between the two where Karin smacks the obnoxious Ingeri across the face. Hurt at what she did Karin tries to make up with her older step-sister but Ingrei, in an attempt to get back at Karin, uses that incident to stay behind and leave Karin to go through the unfriendly forest on her own. Ingrei also ends up at this old geezer's, Alex Slongus, place thinking that he's what he claims to be some half-a** pagan sorcerer. Ingrei tries to get the dirty old man to put a spell on Karin only to have him try to rape her!On her own in the forest Karin is approached by these three goat headers Alex Tor and their little brother Ove. After being treated to Karin's lunch and hospitably Alex & Tor brutally, with the exception of little Ove, attack rape and later, with Tor bashing Karin's head in, murder her. While all this is happening Ingeri is in the woods watching unable to stop this brutal crime against her step-sister. Later she feels responsible for her death more then her murderer, Tor. Since she had prayed that very morning to the Pagan and Norse God Odin for such a thing to happen.As if it were fated to happen the three herders end up that very evening at Karin's parents farm looking or a place to stay and shelter from the freezing cold. It's at Tore's place that the herders try to pawn off Karin's clothes to her shocked mother Mareta for some ready cash. With that Mareta finally knew what happened to her daughter, who has yet to come back from church, and together with her equally shocked and thoroughly vengeful husband Tore plan a going away party for the three that they'll never forget.I felt almost as bad for little Ove as I did for Karin in him being killed by Tore together with his two brothers, Alex & Tor. Since he had nothing at all to do with Karin's death in fact he was so sickened and traumatized by it to the point of trying to give the dead and discarded Karin a proper burial. Tore's vengeance had become almost as mindless and vicious against the herders as their lustful and murderous actions against his daughter Karin. With Tore, which you couldn't say about his kindly and feeling wife Mareta, by not even suspecting that Ove who was in fact both very hurt and repentant at what happened to Karin.Tore came to his senses later at what he did, and how unchristian it was, by swearing to God to build a church with his own bear hands on the very spot where Karin was murdered that was to make up for his vicious and pagan-like vengeance. In some strange and mystical way God did forgive Tore by having a virgin spring sprout forth right where poor and sweet Karin was murdered. As for the guilt-ridden Ingeri she saw the spring as holy water to wash and baptize her face and hands in order to cleanse all the hatred and jealousy ,that she had for her step-sister Karin, out of her body and soul.",

            "content": "I don't know why, but it has seemed to me that Ingmar Bergman's reputation was in a type of eclipse in recent years. Except for Woody Allen (an admitted active admirer), no recent director of stature suggested that he or she were influenced by Bergman. It did not help that his last major work, FANNY AND ALEXANDRA, dated from the early 1980s, and that for many years he concentrated on theater work. Still, that string of masterpieces he produced in the 1950s through 1970s was astounding, doing much to establish Swedish cinema as a major force in film at the time. But the choice was Bergman's - he may have felt that nothing further existed to discuss in terms of film stock.One thing I liked about Bergman's classics, VIRGIN SPRING and THE SEVENTH SEAL, was that those were two of the few films of real note and strength dealing with the Scandanavian world of the Middle Ages. Of course, Bergman was doing more than just making two historical films (just like SMILES OF A SUMMER NIGHT is more than just a look at life in the 19th Century in Sweden). Bergman tackled the major philosophical problems of man in his films. His handling of those issues make them all relevant.The issue here is the loss of innocence. Max von Sydow (in a terrific performance) is a wealthy farm owner named Tore, married to one Maretta (Brigitta Valberg), who have had many children - but only the youngest one (Karin - Brigitta Petterson) has survived. She is the idol of their eyes, but she favors her father more than the mother - much to Maretta's quiet sorrow. But, despite a typical Christian form (prayers before ritual family - farm workers meals; gifts of cheeses to the local church), von Sydow is a hypocrite. He has had an affair with a servant producing a good looking daughter (Ingeri - Gunnel Lindblom), but she is an unwanted bastard child and must be \"beneath the salt\" with the other servants (von Sydow apparently feels he is doing his due to this child by giving her food, clothes, and a home although only if she works for it!).Ingeri naturally resents the petting of her half-sister Karin. But she has no real option against the situation. Karin is sent with Ingeri to deliver gifts of candles and cheese to the local church. The film shows how the girls quarrel finally (all of Ingeri's resentments come to the surface) and she deserts the other. Karin does not care, nor does she note that it is not safe for wealthy young women to travel alone on roads in 1200 or so. She meets three herdsmen brothers (a talkative blond - Axel Daberg, a sinister bearded brunette - Tor Luda, and a silent boy - Ove Porath) who pretend to be friendly and have lunch with her. Shortly after they rape her (the blond and the bearded ones, while the boy watches), and then one of them kills her with a heavy tree branch. Across the river, watching the whole tragedy is Ingeri, who is fascinated but does not aid her half-sister.The film's remainder is how the murderers turn up at von Sydow's farm for food (not realizing who came from there). They spin a series of lies to their hosts (both Tore and Mareta are very anxious because their daughter should have been back by now). But they feed the three (despite the obvious emotional turmoil of the youngest - the boy - who can't eat), and offer the two oldest work. Everyone is going to sleep when Ingeri returns and tells what happened. Tore acts carefully - he has already been made suspicious by the behavior of the boy and by the stupid act of the blond herdsman of offering \"family\" heirlooms of his \"dead sister\" to Mareta - who recognizes that they look like Karin's and shows them to Tore. Now he goes into the field and in his mounting fury rips down a young sapling (symbolic of his lost daughter). It is in many ways the tragic center of the film - and the best remembered moment.Soon he confront the murderers and kills them - and then comes the irony as his fury leads to the killing of the boy (a symbol, like Karin, of innocence). Even Mareta tries to save the boy. The rest of the film is how the family goes to find Karin's body, and finds it. Tore asks God how he could allow his daughter to die like this, and expect to be worshiped. But he still agrees to pray to this seemingly twisted deity, even promising a church in repentance for his sins (including the killing of the boy). As Tore lifts the dead Karin's body, a spring of holy water starts flowing to cleanse the spot and the sins of the onlookers.There are nice little allegorical touches (look at the bits dealing with a piece of bread that Ingeri packs for Kristin's lunch with a living toad - a sign of malevolence in medieval art. The toad reappears among the doomed rapists later on). The end result is that the indifference of God to right and wrong, and the unhappy fates of the innocent (Kristin and the boy) is never settled accept by resignation and admission of powerlessness. Tore's punishment for his sins of the flesh and ignoring Ingeri is to accept God's indifference to him as much as Ingeri has to accept Tore's indifference to her.",

            "review_title": "On the inclination to do evil, and the morality of vengeance",
            "content": "In watching these old Ingmar Bergman movies, the thought occurs to me that Bergman was to cinema what the golden age of Russian literature was to writing. His films have a certain depth to them, and feel meaty with their observations on human nature and their questions of religion and philosophy. 'The Virgin Spring', based on a 13th century Swedish ballad, is no exception.If you think about it, the story of 'The Virgin Spring' encapsulates quite a bit of the effect of religion on those who believe, starting with a girl needing to mind her chastity until marriage, and continuing on with a virgin must deliver candles for Matins. When a horrible thing happens to the girl, her companion and her mother both believe it's because of them, that God had listened to their jealous prayers, while her father is stricken and asks that time-old question, \"God, how could you let this happen?\" However, none of them challenge that most deeply held assertion, that God exists in the first place. After exacting brutal vengeance, including killing a child, the grief-ridden father asks God for forgiveness, and promises to build him a church on the site. He still believes in spite of it all, wants to remain upright in the best way he can conceive, and is both admirable and flawed at the same time.In telling this story with elements of Job (\"Why?\") and Exodus/Leviticus (\"An eye for an eye\"), Bergman examines human nature - the inclination to do evil, and the morality of vengeance \u2013 as well as the nature of God, and our relationship to Him. How you perceive the film's meaning will likely depend on your most personal views, but it will certainly make you think.As for the filmmaking, Bergman keeps his storytelling taut \u2013 every scene counts \u2013 and he captures plenty of great moments, including some beautiful shots of the outdoors in Sweden, and heavy emotions on the faces of his actors. One scene in particular made the film controversial, however, and no review would be complete without mentioning it. The rape is horrific, and seriously disturbing. We see evil coming as Bergman masterfully builds up tension, but are still shocked - both at the incredible cruelty of the men, but also at Bergman keeping the camera on them as they commit the act (especially for 1960). He knew he didn't have to show a lot of flesh to show how vile, disgusting, degrading, and animalistic a rape is, and it's a shame the film was banned in some places given the prevalence of rape in society. The scene speaks to the darkest aspect of man, and yet oozes authenticity.As to whether religion casts a darkness of its own on man, the shadow of ignorance, or gives his life meaning and elevates him over nihilism and chaos, the reader will have to decide, but I believe Bergman is in the latter camp with this film. He is a bit over the top at the end, hitting us over the head with the miracle of the 'virgin spring' that gushes forth, and while that's presumably how the 13th century legend goes, it's the reason I knocked my rating down a bit for what is still a very good film.",

            "content": "The rape and death of Karin is what the movie is, but the (probably accidental) killing of the boy, which is over in a second, is perhaps even more tragic--it occurred in a moment of rage by someone not evil and in no way a murderer--although it is interesting how Tore (Max von Sydow) does not dwell on this for even a second; you see briefly that he cannot believe the boy is dead, shaking him, but then it is back to business. The killing of the boy is perhaps the most searing moment in all of the horrors which had been set into motion by the crimes begun earlier.The ritual preparation for revenge by Tore rubbing himself with the tree limbs is powerful--I am not familiar with the history of this practise. Birgitta Pettersson is the most Easter-looking child one could imagine. As the rape begins to encroach as a reality, you fight as hard as Karin did against believing that such a thing could really happen to one so pure. Miss Petersson conveys something interesting here, in that her Karin's realization takes far longer than does that of the viewer.The little boy would most likely have grown up to be like the horrible criminal family he was a part of, but that is beside the point, since he is innocent up until the moment of his death of the crimes against Karin that the slime have committed.'Through a Glass Darkly'(with Harriet Andersson and Gunnar Bjornstrand) is also very powerful, 'Wild Strawberries'(with the magnificent, recently deceased Ingrid Thulin and a young Bibi Andersson), 'The Silence', and 'Winter Light' are a few of the other great pictures from the same Bergman period. Even a bit earlier is the gorgeous 'Smiles of a Summer Night', a happy paean to young lovers, with contrasting jaded characters like the actress played by Eva Dahlbeck.

Rape, murder, superstition, belief, revenge, are the ingredients to this outstanding dish. As far as I know the movie is based on an old legend and Bergman again tells us the story in a very reduced manner and in pictures with a quiet, poetic and meditative character.",

            "content": "Even if not written by Bergman himself and inspired by a 13th century folk-tale, the Swedish master manages to put his stamp on the film by virtue of his unflinchingly realist style and the stark beauty of his visuals (from this time on, he worked almost exclusively with the great Sven Nykvist as his cinematographer). Incidentally, THE VIRGIN SPRING forms a sort of medieval trilogy with Bergman\u2019s THE SEVENTH SEAL (1957) and THE MAGICIAN (1958) \u2013 and, of course, it also garnered a dubious reputation years after winning the Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar with the release of Wes Craven\u2019s controversial \u2018remake\u2019 THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972)!Max Von Sydow here plays a paterfamilias older than his 31 years while Gunnel Lindblom\u2019s typical role of a heretical farm girl provides the actress with one of her best showcases. The ambiguous relationship between the two is only hinted at \u2013 he not only does not vent his anger on her for abandoning his beloved daughter to her tragic fate, but also takes a strangely ritualistic shower fully naked in her presence...could the child she is expecting be his?Birgitta Petersson, then, perfectly epitomizes the na\u00efvely flirtatious nature of Karin \u2013 von Sydow\u2019s teenage daughter who\u2019s brutally assaulted and murdered by a trio of uncouth shepherds. Still, for all her eventual miraculous qualities (with the sudden appearance of the spring at the end eliciting almost as much awe as the climactic resurrection scene in Carl Theodor Dreyer\u2019s ORDET [1955]), Karin is a spoiled brat who invites her own doom by snobbishly practicing Christian charity to the first unfortunate she meets on the road \u2013 this may well be Bergman\u2019s cynical take on the would-be godly virtues professed by the Catholic Church and its followers. Kindness being repaid by disdain and violence is a theme which also figures in Luis Bunuel\u2019s VIRIDIANA (1961) \u2013 a film which, ironically, Bergman despised!The best sequences are: the sensitively-handled rape/murder and the stylized but chilling retribution (I was even influenced by one of the deaths here for a script of mine!); unlike the clutter of the herdsmen\u2019s crime, the parents\u2019 vengeance is a calculated \u2013 even ritualistic \u2013 action (though both occur in complete silence, which accentuates the unbearable tension inherent in these two life-altering situations).While relatively free of the pretentiousness which basically marked his work from 1961 onwards, Bergman (or his screenwriter) cannot resist having the mother bemoaning loudly the fact that the daughter preferred the father to her while en route to fetching her lifeless body \u2013 a brief intimation of the chamber dramas which would populate Bergman\u2019s later career (see my review of AUTUMN SONATA [1978]) but also that of Woody Allen and John Cassavetes, his chief American acolytes; the baffling presence of a philosophical laborer who kisses the hand of his benefactress before each dinner feels equally incongruous in the context of the picture.",

            "content": "The tension and anxiety that this film induced in me kept me glued to my seat for the entire running time. On the surface it's a simple enough story. A lovely maiden sets out to bring candles to the church in the village. Only a virgin may do this. On the way she encounters two ruffians and a boy who persuade her to dally awhile. The girl, naive, on the threshold of womanhood, with her whole life before her, suggests a picnic where she spins fanciful tales of her being a princess. The two men don't believe the girl, and inflict their brutality upon her. They strip her of her finery and bring it to sell at the dwelling of the local feudal knight who just happens to be her father. Big mistake.The story is set in a land where Christianity, paganism and witchcraft compete for the hearts and minds of its inhabitants. Guilt and redemption are forefront in the tale as the leading characters ponder their part in the tragedy. There is a sense, even early in the film when the girl, delirious and rapturous, is getting ready for the journey and working her guile and charm on her doting parents, that no good is going to come of this. She's hated by her sister, a surly wench, a lost soul, who accompanies the girl on her journey and witnesses the brutal events with carnal excitement. Indeed, it's all downhill, but once the knight (Max von Sydow) exacts his terrible revenge on the killers (in a scene of horrifying, intimate violence) he - and the viewer - are plunged into hopelessness and chaos. Now the guilt has spread like a stain. How can man or God ever rectify this?\"The Virgin Spring\" did something very special for me, something that few films do: It transported me to another world. It created a time and place that was so completely realized and convincing that It seemed as if I was watching, not a fictional creation, but the real thing. I absolutely adored the mother, her strength, her love, her serenity, and couldn't take my eyes off her. For me, the pivotal dramatic moment in the film was when she recognizes the blood-stained clothes of her daughter. The scene is heart-wrenching as she struggles to maintain her composure and pretend that she doesn't recognize the garments.I'm adept at suspending disbelief, but usually there's something that breaks the illusion (I remember noticing, in \"Marie Antoinette\", that there was no litter in the streets of the Paris slums). The settings in this film are astonishing in their detail, intimacy and human scale. Sven Nykvist, the photographer, creates an early Spring, in black and white, that is crisp, refreshing and beautiful.",

            "review_title": "CAN ART BE MADE FROM TRAGEDY?",
            "content": "Years ago when I first saw THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT I'd read that it was loosely based on the 1960 Ingmar Bergman film THE VIRGIN SPRING. For one reason or another I'd never been able to see that movie though so just how loosely I never knew. That was one of the sad things about there being no video at one time and later that video stores didn't carry many films considered \"art films\" in small towns. So when I saw Criterion was releasing the film I was anxious to finely have the opportunity to see it.The movie features Max Von Sydow as Christian Per T\u00f6re, a landowner in medieval Sweden who has converted to Christianity with his wife M\u00e4reta (Birgitta Valberg). They have a young daughter named Karin who we see early on is indulged being the apple of her father's eye. Living in the same house is Ingeri (Gunnel Lindblom), a peasant serf of the family who resents them and has a reputation that has left her pregnant. With a holy day coming Karin is assigned the task of taking candles to the nearby church. Anxious to go she dresses in her finest clothes and asks that Ingeri accompany her. With hate in her eyes Ingeri goes along until they reach a stream before entering the nearby forest. Afraid for some reason she remains behind with the man who owns mill at the stream. When he attempts to assault her she runs after the long gone Karin.As she makes her way through the forest Karin comes across three herdsmen, brothers, and offers to share her lunch with them. They lead her to a field and as lunch progresses she senses danger from the three. Before she can escape them they're on her and rape her. When she tries to run afterward, one clubs her to death. As this all happens Ingeri watches from the wood, never helping. The men steal the fine clothes Karin was wearing and leave her behind in the woods. Back at the homestead Christian and his wife worry about their young daughter when she doesn't return, but not overly so. She's stayed in town before. As it grows dark the three herdsmen show at the house completely unaware that this is the home of Karin. They're invited in and provided a meal and shelter with the potential of work. During the night however M\u00e4reta finds her daughter's clothing among their things. Ingeri returns and tells them what happened. Events are set in motion from that point that will forever change them all.Most people will have already known the story of this film with it being over 50 years old now but I decided not to reveal the final portion of the film. That's difficult to do because some of the most striking images are contained there. If you watch the film on the Criterion edition you'll see what I mean and also hear in the extras some of the things I can't quite refer to here.The story is stark and brutal but there's no other way to depict what occurs. That this much was shown (though no real skin makes it to the screen) in 1960 is stunning in itself. But the brutal act of rape is on display and the murder after while quick is also heightened by the way the body is ransacked and left totally exposed to the world. It's upsetting and yet at the same time not nearly as much so as later films depicting the same act have been. LAST HOUSE that I referenced earlier or even the rape in DEATH WISH are much more upsetting. But the na\u00efve attitude of Karin and her soft beauty make it an unbearable act in this film. What comes later at the hands of a grieving father is equally disturbing and yet done in such a manner as to truly be considered artistic.The movie in its entirety itself is gorgeous. Cinematographer Sven Nykvist did an amazing job with the stark black and white photography shown here. This was the first film he did with Bergman and they collaborated on many more after. The clarity of the Criterion version here is amazing. As an example a scene early on of Ingeri that's backlit shows the fine strands of stray hair completely visible in the picture. And being shot in black and white actually helps the movie rather than hinder it. To be honest this is the first film by Bergman I've had the opportunity to watch. The only reason I can explain for that as someone who loves all things film is that I've never had access to any of his films, even taking classes in film. I'd always heard his films were somber affairs and judging from this one I couldn't argue that. I'd need to see more to believe or deny that. When he began making films of a more serious nature Woody Allen said that Bergman was a big influence on him. I can see that in some sense but again, without seeing more wouldn't begin to say that's correct or not.Criterion has offered the film here with the respect that it deserves beginning with a 2k digital restoration of the film that as I said earlier is amazing. In addition to that they've included several extras worthy of mention. Those include an audio commentary by Bergman scholar Birgitta Steene, an introduction by Ang Lee from 2005 describing the influence the film had on him, an audio recording of a 1975 American Film Institute seminar by Bergman, an alternate English dubbed soundtrack for those who don't favor subtitles and a booklet featuring essays by film scholar Peter Cowie and screenwriter Ulla Isaksson and the medieval ballad on which the film is based.Criterion has done a bang up job on this release and it's nice knowing that such a copy exists for those who wish to explore the movie and the films of Bergman. This will be edition that fans will want to add to their collection. Film students would bode well to pick this up too. And movie lovers might want to give this a watch to discover Bergman.",

In most of the cases revenge is the most probable expected outcome.So the devout Christian father depicted in the film is persuaded to carry out savage killings.These killings cannot be justified but no one would want to leave killers go unpunished and commit other crimes if they have harmed someone's close family member.There is even pardon too as a plea is made to spare a young boy's life.In this film the depiction of a staunch Jesus Christ loving family is top notch.Good too are the scenes of medieval village life where families lived together mutually sharing all their joys and sorrows.Virgin Spring will surely appeal to you if you have a penchant for religious films.",

They send their privileged and rather spoiled daughter on a journey to the church to deliver candles as an offering for the virgin mother. Her less fortunate pregnant step sister is asked to go along. While on their journey, the step sister develops a fear of the forest and also complains of being sick. Karin,the privileged daughter, has her stay with a hermit in the forest while she continues the journey alone. Along the way she runs into a three goatherds,two man and a young boy who are brothers. They complain of being hungry due to their long journey so out of kindness, she offers to picnic with them in which she shares her bread with them. The two man proceed to rape her and then kill her while the young boy watches helpless. Her step sister had left the cabin where she was staying and witnessed the whole thing but did nothing to help Karin. By chance, the three brothers turn up at Karin's parents farm. The herdsman tries to sell Karin's valuable garments that they had removed from her to her mother. This leads the father to take revenge on the herdsman.This is a film I would strongly recommend to anyone especially lovers of classic cinema. The only other Bergman film I have seen is The Seventh Seal which is also outstanding. This film was extremely troubling to me not only because of the brutal act but also because Karin did not deserve this. We have a young innocent naive girl whose trust was betrayed. In this film we see the dynamics of these two sisters. Karin was privileged and spoiled by her parents especially her mother. Her father is more stern but she is still able to break him down with her charm. The step sister is of a much lower stature. She works as a servant and farm hand while Karin doesn't have to do any work. As a result, the step sister has a strong resentment toward Karin. Unlike the Cinderella storey, Karin is very kind to Ingeri, her step sister. She is also very concerned for her as a result of her being pregnant. When she comes across the herdsman, being from the wealthy upper class, she could have easily blown them off but instead she spends time with them and offers them her food only to get violated and murdered in return. In actuality, seeing three men(while two men and a boy) in the forest should have caused her to run away. As an example of her gullibility, right before she is about to be raped, the men say things like \"what white hands you have\" and she replies buy saying something to the likes of \"because a princess never has to work\" then they proceed by saying \"What a lovely neck you have\" while sitting very close to her. She than says something to the likes of (I am going to be way off here!) \"how else can a lovely princes wear her bracelets\". She then goes on to tell them about their farm and her well to do life. She is not saying all this in a stuck up way trying to brag. Again she is a very naive girl who has lived like a princes. She expects the men to share her enthusiasm! The step sister did not do anything possibly out of resentment to her step sister or it could have been out of fear. When the herdsman arrive at Karin's parents farm and her father finds out what they have done to Karin, he kills them including the boy. This is another very tragic part of the movie. Like Karin, the boy was also innocent. He had nothing to do with the rape and murder of Karin. One could argue that he could have stopped his brothers instead of just watching. In reality, their is absolutely nothing he could have done. His older brothers are grown men while he is just a small boy. As a matter of fact, they physically abuse him. Not only is the boy a victim like Karin but he is also an outcast like Ingeri, the step sister. He is treated bad by his brothers and Ingeri is treated bad by her family although not by Karin. After Tore,the father, kills the two man and goes after the boy, he runs to Mareta, the mother, for protection. She tries to protect him from Tore but is unable to do so and the father proceeds to kill him.Tore immediately feels remorse for what he had done. The parents and farm hands go to find Karin's body led by Ingeri. When Mareta lifts Karins body from the ground, a spring arises from the site. Tore vows to God to build a church there.",

            "content": "I guess to many viewers today, Bergman can be difficult to approach as he lived in his own world and did not follow any accepted clich\u00e9 - the budget is fairly limited, there's nothing flashy or bombastic, not even a background music, the focus is entirely on story, actors and their faces. Myself, I watch all of this with amazement and thrill, but to my greatest sorrow and disappointment, this enthusiasm is not shared amongst my friends who have accepted movies as entertainment. I still remember the first time that I encountered \"The Seventh Seal\" and what a mind-boggling experience that was, I wanted to stop VHS tape and write down the phrases coming from the movie. \"Virgin spring\" mesmerized me at first because of its scenery - medieval Sweden, simple farm with lord and his wife, house help and world where old pagan religion has still not completely replaced with Christianity. Than there is a story itself - faith, guilt, sin, crime, punishment - full of close-ups of people's faces, terrors and fears. Lots of time we don't need any dialogue, everything is clearly shown on the faces. Come to think of it, it does feel like a silent movie occasionally, which in my eyes is even bigger achievement, like theater director working on a silent movie actually. Unforgettable.Again, seeing something so truly original, powerful and artistic but apparently my enthusiasm is not shared amongst the people around me. I love my friends dearly, but something I do feel like alien, to realize our ways of thinking differs so much. It is very interesting - I was born and raised here, so what on earth made my perspective so different? I guess life experiences, travels (real and imaginative) did made some differences after all. Perhaps I just continued to grow in my own, particular direction, just like they did.",

Set in medieval Sweden, the story is inspired by a 13th century ballad and is refreshingly simple: On her way to church, a beautiful young girl is raped and killed by two desperate shepherds, accompanied by a 13 year old boy. Unfortunately for them, they would later take shelter in the home of the girl's father (Max Von Sydow, in a fine performance). When he learns they are her daughter's killers, he will take justice by his own hands, killing them as well as the innocent boy. In the place where the girl was murdered, a spring miraculously appears. The movie is oddly catholic (in Francoist Spain, this film was shown in churches), yet is moving, beautifully shot in black and white, unpretentious and straightforward.",

Von Sydow and Valberg are excellent as the parents of the young woman. Lindblom, however, overacts as a servant girl who witnesses the crime. As with \"The Seventh Seal,\" Bergman is preoccupied here with man's relationship with God, but this film is much more accessible because it also works as a straightforward narrative instead of getting bogged down in abstract ideas. The cinematography by Nykvist is superb. The rape scene is quite brutal, and certainly could not have been made in Hollywood at that time.",

            "content": "This film is not a happy film--and that's no big surprise since it's from Ingmar Bergman! However, it is unusual in that it focuses on the rape of beloved daughter in 14th century Sweden. The parents wonder WHERE the girl is, as she should h ave been back from her trip to church sooner. In the meantime, three brothers stop by and are invited in for food and lodging by the father. It seems these men were responsible for the rape and murder of this missing girl and neither the men nor the family are aware of the irony of their meeting. However, when one of the men offers to sell items to the mother that clearly belonged to the missing daughter, she knows something is amiss and tells her husband. The husband first talks to the strange pagan girl that lives with them what she knows about the men (after all, she had gone with the daughter when she disappeared). The girl admits that these men killed and raped the girl but she did not tell sooner, as she felt responsible for this (though she had done nothing to cause it). Having confirmation, he confronts the men. Two of them are adults and one looks about 12 or 13 years-old. The two older ones pull knives and the father kills them. However, the younger one tries to run and the father kills him as well with his bare hands! He is overwhelmed by guilt and vows to build a church as penance--at which time a minor miracle seems to occur. An odd ending, huh?! I liked the film because I have daughters and I thought WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE? Based on the way events unfolded, I could easily see myself behaving EXACTLY as the girl's grief-stricken father did. This is chilling but makes the movie interesting--a good man responds brutally to evil and is ashamed of how bestial he can be.",

            "review_title": "\"Because the Devil Seduces the Innocent\" - A Devastating Tale of Revenge.",
            "content": "\"The Virgin Spring\" (also known as \"Jungfruk\u00e4llan\" in its original Swedish language), is director Ingmar Bergman's classic of cinema that is often noted for its utter controversy and dark, challenging themes. One of the few 'horror' films to be historically hailed by critics and audiences, it won an Oscar, among many other awards, including a Golden Globe and praise at the Cannes film festival (and deservedly so). This is one disturbing, morally challenging, and heavy-handed movie.Set in medieval Sweden, young Catholic girl Karin and her older half-sister, Ingeri, are on their way to church through the forest by horseback. Ingeri, who is pregnant, decides not to go on, and Karin continues without her as Ingeri waits behind at an old hermit's cottage. As she proceeds through the forest, her attention is captured by two goat herders whom ultimately rape and murder her, after she displays nothing but kindness and empathy towards them. All the worse, a young boy who was with the herders is there to witness the horrific crime. By a grim and bizarre twist of fate, the goat herders and the young boy end up being taken in by Karin's parents. And when they discover what the men have done to their daughter, they enact a horrible revenge.Often pointed out as a precursor to Wes Craven's exploitation horror film \"The Last House on the Left\" (sans the extreme, gratuitous violence), \"The Virgin Spring\" is an immensely powerful tale of wrongdoing and revenge. Based on a thirteenth century ballad, the story is simplistic but ravaging all at the same time. Blended in with the revenge-centered plot are moral clashes between Christianity and paganism (the invoking of a curse by Karin's jealous half- sister, Ingeri, preceding Karin's murder, being the most prime example), which give the viewer even more food for thought after the film closes. For its eighty-nine minute running time, this little film sure packs quite the punch.Bergman's camera-work is great here, the imagery and landscapes are utterly beautiful and strangely haunting. The acting is all-around excellent, with Max von Sydow as a revenge-driven father. Birgitte Pettersson is also excellent in the role of Karin, and possesses the fragile innocence and angelic face that is required for the role. The audience can't help but cringe with utter discomfort and disbelief as the naive, goodhearted young girl is so heartbreakingly taken advantage of and ultimately murdered by the vile, filthy woodsmen. The revenge taken upon by the parents of Karin is bittersweet, but well-deserved (albeit the young boy who was merely a witness) after the unspeakable acts committed on their innocent daughter. The rape and murder scene, to this day, is still downright harrowing and extremely unpleasant to watch. But most powerful of all, is that at the core of the film is a relentless dilemma between religious faith, and downright nihilistic evil, and challenges the audience to make their own judgement on it. All the prayers and devotion in the world cannot stop evil people from doing evil things, and that is where I believe this film contains the majority of its power. Ultimately, what is the point of faith if it is unable to protect those who are devout? The film laces this moral question with the revenge theme (also throwing in some possible occult phenomena that may or may not have led to Karin's demise), and it all makes for some very hard-hitting viewing. This is the type of film that one can ponder days after watching, which tells me it is something special.Overall, \"The Virgin Spring\" is a masterpiece of cinema. I couldn't believe I hadn't seen it sooner, but was very pleased with it. It's a bleak, unsettling film that challenges its audience to rethink a handful of moral controversies, and all the while manages to be well-written, well-acted, and completely entertaining. Perhaps one of the greatest horror movies ever made, and definitely an all-time classic of cinema. I can't think of a single reason to not recommend it, but do keep in mind, it may be a bit much for the faint of heart- I wouldn't call it scary, but it's safe to say that it is a very disturbing, thought-provoking movie. As they say: \"evil is as evil does\". 10/10.",

            "review_title": "The most heartbreaking movie I have ever seen",
            "content": "This small film may not be as ambitious as Bergman's more renowned The Seventh Seal, but I have seen so many movies from throughout history and I have seen very very few that affected me so deeply.  It is such a simple story, but Bergman's direction makes it a film that stays with viewers forever.The opening shot of the frightening Ingeri is chilling.  We don't know anything yet about any of the characters or the story, yet this is still scary, because of the dark lighting and the actress's brilliant mannerisms. Ingeri clearly looks possessed, and when we find out later that she placed a horrifying curse on Karin it makes sense.  The use of lighting and imagery throughout the movie is incredible.  When Karin  was first introduced, I immediately fell in love with her.  She was so gentle, and so caring, and looked like an angel, especially with the way shots of her were lit.  She invites Ingeri to go to the church with her, because Ingeri doesn't get to go out much.  This review contains spoilers: When the story reaches the woods, Karin's sweet, innocent nature is further established when she gives much of her food to the swineherds and gives them company.  Knowing what was going to happen made this scene unbearably tense, and of course that gets much worse when Karin realizes their intention and tries to escape, but is cornered and then falls over a branch and is left vulnerable.  The camera cuts away, but next we see the men, after having laid her on the ground, lifting up her legs and spreading them apart. That's certainly not graphic compared to some things we see nowadays, but I found it devastating to watch because it was Karin, such a beautiful girl who deserved nothing of this sort.  While Karin is getting raped, we see Ingeri across the river, holding a stone at first but then letting it fall and simply watching contentedly as Karin continues to get violated.  With all the sincere kindness Karin has show Ingeri, the hatred she receives in return is absolutely appalling.   Then we see Karin get up after the rape, and her dirty tear stroked face is such an awful contrast to the smiling picture of beauty we saw earlier.  As if taking away her purity wasn't enough, one of the men picks up a huge stick and strikes a fatal blow to her head, and then they steal her dress. Bergman's mise-en-scene throughout this scene is outstanding.Later after Tore finds out the truth about his guests, the scene with him preparing for his bloody revenge will scare even the most jaded viewer.  The mise-en-scene is once again amazing during the murders, especially the use of the fire.  After he is subdued by his horror at his own rage, I was moved by Mareta's quietly saying \"Let us go find Karin\".  Karin's dead unclothed body, with her eyes chewed out by buzzards, is one of the most unforgettable images in a movie absolutely packed with them.  When Tore picked up the body, and the spring magically appeared, it put a bittersweet smile on my face, as though God was saying everything would be okay.  The final shot with Tore asking God for forgiveness as he had the body of his only child was moving beyond words.  I've read criticism of the ending, as some feel the spring didn't belong and it was not like Bergman to include something affirming a belief in God like that.  If it had not been there, the film would have been that much more cryptic, but I feel it was incredible either way.  I actually woke up in the middle of the night after I watched this movie, recalling images after that rape and thinking \"I can't believe those monsters did something so horrible to such an innocent young girl\" but then I reminded myself that the film is teaching us not to be full of hate and vengeance.  I compared the rape images to the one of Tore murdering that young boy.  Wes Craven's horrible remake Last House on the Left used the tagline \"Keep telling yourself 'It's only a movie'\", but this is the film that needs that tagline.  I had to tell myself that to keep from being depressed.  This one movie is enough to show why Ingmar Bergman is considered a filmmaking immortal.",

She encounters a one-eyed man at an old mill. The one-eyed man tried to harass her. During that time, three herders lurk a beautiful daughter...Mr. Bergman has tried, in an explicit, rude and brutal way to equalize a criminal and a vigilante. Moral games have reflected through human power in certain moments, which is in contrast with the fear of God. Rape is very realistic and brutal in this film. This could cause the opposite effect on the audience. This, regardless of the \"Bergman's artistic magic\", was unexpected. An innocent teenage story turns into a nightmare. However, the religious motive is constant. Symbols of innocence were killed in a primal passion and an unbearable pain.A medieval scenery contributes to a visual impression.

            "content": "Being an atheist, I have always found it challenging to review a religious movie, because I worry that my criticism will be more about religion than about the movie. This difficulty is compounded if it is not clear what the attitude of those who produced the movie is toward that religion, whether they intended the movie to be a criticism of religion or a defense of it. In other words, it is not clear to me whether \"The Virgin Spring\" looks upon the simple faith of some fourteenth century peasants in the same way that parents will smile at their child's belief in Santa Claus, or whether the movie actually shares that faith in God and encourages us to do likewise.Anyway, as I said, there is this fourteenth century family of Swedish peasants headed by T\u00f6re. His daughter is Karin, who is a blonde virgin. Well, her body may be pure, but her soul is not. She is lazy, vain, and spoiled, smug in the fact that she is so cute and adorable that she can do as she pleases. She has a foster sister, Ingeri, who is a brunette, a bastard soon to give birth to a bastard of her own. The two of them set out for church to do something or other, and on the way it turns out that the other night Karin was flirting with the man that got Ingeri pregnant. Though there is no hope that he will marry Ingeri, yet Karin's dalliance with him infuriates Ingeri. Just to rub it in, Karin taunts Ingeri for no longer being a virgin, while gloating over the way she will someday be married in all her virginal purity. She really made my flesh crawl.They get separated, and soon after Karin comes upon three goat herders that rape and murder her. They strip her body of her beautiful clothes. Later, they ask for lodging at T\u00f6re's house, not realizing he is Karin's father. That night, they present Karin's clothing to her mother as a gift, saying it belonged to their sister. She tells T\u00f6re about it. He asks Ingeri what she knows, and she admits that she witnessed the rape and murder and feels guilty because she wanted Karin to get her comeuppance. T\u00f6re then murders the three goat herders, one of whom was just a boy, who had nothing to do with what happened to Karin. Then T\u00f6re feels guilty for having committed murder. The whole family goes out to where Karin's body lies dead. When they find her, T\u00f6re raises the ancient problem of evil, asking why God let this happen and then let him commit murder, while at the same time saying that he begs God's forgiveness.Now, this is what I was talking about. Are we supposed to approve of T\u00f6re's attitude or should we be disgusted? I mean, I'm disgusted. In fact, it is even a little disgusting that he had to wait until his daughter was raped and murdered before questioning how an all-powerful, loving God could let this happen. After all, God has been standing by and letting girls get raped and murdered for centuries, and it is only now, when his daughter is a victim, that he takes exception to God's indifference. So, am I being disgusted with the movie or with the religion that this movie is premised upon?It gets worse. T\u00f6re promises to build a church on the spot where Karin died, in hopes of being worthy of God's forgiveness. Then, when they lift up her body, water begins to gush from the ground where she lay, becoming a spring. The family treats the water as if it is a miracle, a replenishing gift from God. That's right. Karin's rape and murder have been worth it, because now we are going to get a church with a little spring nearby. Perhaps I should point out that there is no shortage of water in that area, the family having crossed a large stream on their way to get to Karin, so it is not as though the spring will bring needed water to a parched region. It's just more water.Here we go again. I don't know whether we are supposed to regard that spring as a real miracle or not. If it is a miracle, then we have to wonder: as long as God was willing to perform a miracle, why didn't he miraculously save Karin instead? If it is not a miracle, are we supposed to despise or admire the family for thinking it is one?I give up. I'll have to let someone who actually believes in God tell me what I am supposed to make of this movie.",

            "content": "Ingmar Bergman is not my favourite director, and that's putting it lightly. Bergman's films are very low in the entertainment department and as a man that rates this factor as an very important one when it comes to watching films (I'm not one of those 'pain for pleasure' kind of guys), Bergman simply isn't for me. However, there are exceptions to this rule; most notably The Seventh Seal and Wild Strawberries. Not forgetting this film of course; as it may well be Bergman's finest achievement. The Virgin Spring is a tale of religion, vengeance and redemption all wrapped up in a tale of rape and murder. The plot follows a young girl who sets off to take some candles to the church. On her way, she travels through a forest and bumps into two men and a young boy who want her to accompany them to a secluded area and have something to eat. However, things go awry and the girl ends up being raped and then murdered...but her father gets a chance for vengeance when the men find themselves as guests in their victim's home.Unlike many of Bergman's films, this one certainly isn't boring and it keeps itself going with a constant stream of intrigue, whether it be from the events on screen or Bergman's insight into the characters. That is why I say that this is Bergman's finest hour; with this film, the man has perfectly captured the intrigue enough to ensure that the audience always has something to think about. Much of the thanks for this has to go to Bergman's long time collaborator; Max Von Sydow. Sydow gives a magnificent performance in this film and his performance is a perfect example of how slight mannerisms and understated actions can lead to a captivating piece of acting. Sydow draws you in continually, and this pays off in a big way at the film's powerful conclusion. The film is continually bleak in it's style, and this helps to add to the bleakness of it's story. This is the story that would resurface some twelve years later in the exploitation 'classic' The Last House on the Left, so you've got to know that it's not a tale for people that like their films to be nice. For everyone else, however, this film is a magnificent achievement and one that comes with my highest recommendations.",

Like most Bergman films, it keeps Christianity held tightly in the backdrop, and puts an eerie light on a dark, haunting tale of death and revenge. Nothing he hasn't explored in his other works, but still a worthy accomplishment; this later inspired Wes Craven's debut Last House on the Left, a more gruesome and lessor work when compared to the story telling and emotion projected here.

As the film was made in 1960, scenes of violence are not graphic but have at least as much (maybe more) impact than those in films made decades later.Bergman is well aided by the superb black-and-white cinematography of his long-time collaborator Sven Nykvist whose photography easily enhances the eerie mood of the film. Near the end, Nykvist captures a sunrise like no other.The film is economical in its magnificent impact. Thus, few words are needed to give it the highest praise. Also, the fewer words given, the less likely there are spoilers.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:Directing by Ingmar BergmanCinematography by Sven Nykvist",

Bergman took long shots that slowly developed. There was no rush as the young virgin (Birgitta Pettersson) rode through the forest, and the rape, when it took place was inevitable, but more a statement about the god who wasn't there than a source of titillation.This movie had strong religious overtones. The mother (Birgitta Valberg) was a religious fanatic that pured candle wax on herself as a sacrifice. The father (Max von Sydow) was much less religious; probably a convert from the pagan gods to the Christian one. But all their praying and self-flagellation helped them not when faced with the evil of the world. It was the housemaid, a bastard with a bastard in her belly, that had her hate satisfied as she witnessed the rape.The parents realized the travelers they gave shelter to were murderers, and retribution was swift and bloodless.The father, at the end, could not understand how god could let this happen. He could not understand how he could be driven to kill. Evil exists, and all the prayers and candles given to the church will not make it go away.",

            "content": "In The Virgin Spring, Ingmar Bergman returns to the Medieval Ages, which he had brought to life before so beautifully in The Seventh Seal. Set on a farm, we follow the beautiful Karin, the adolescent daughter of the farmers T\u00f6re and M\u00e4reta, as she travels with her half-sister Ingeri to church to deliver hand-made candles in honor of the Virgin. On the way she crosses paths with a trio of herdsmen who rape her and kill her.By chance they end up in the farm of Karin's parents, and although they're initially kindly received, their own greed and behavior leads the parents to discover their crime and plot a terrible revenge. The plot, give or take a few more situations, is basically this. This one of the simplest movies I've seen by Bergman. It doesn't have the visual metaphors that The Seventh Seal has, nor does it have the awkward behavior his characters indulge in, like in Cries and Whispers. No, it's a simple, beautiful story about innocence lost, revenge, grief and coming to terms with one's own conception of existence.Like The Seventh Seal, this movie focuses on deeply religious characters. God and religious rituals are present in the lives of the farmers and in many of their daily actions, and they find comfort in the fact that God is watching and protecting them. But how does one reconcile this belief with the brutal murder of one's own daughter, an innocent adolescent? That's the final question that haunts T\u00f6re and will surely haunt some viewers. Bergman, like a true artist, doesn't give an answer, although he gives T\u00f6re some peace of mind at the end.Max von Sydow gives a great performance as T\u00f6re, Gunnel Lindblom and Birgitta Valberg give amazing supporting performances. Without these actors, who brought so much sorrow and compassion to the movie, it wouldn't have been very good. A character-based movie like this needs the best actors, and I can't think of anyone better than Von Sydow when it comes to express emotions on screen.Ingmar Bergman is a director I respect but don't particularly love. I find his work most of the time depressing, bleak and humorless. He focuses so much on the pain of existence that he forgets that existence is multi-faceted and is always in flux, it's bright as often as it's dark. That's why I love The Virgin Spring - it's a very humanist movie, one that shows Man at his best and worst, one that realises how complex and undefinable humans are. For me this is the purpose of a true artist.",

We have the \"sister\" if she is that, who is a servant of the ancient religions. She isn't thought of as member of the family and the dialogue might lead us to believe that she is a person taken in by the family. The rape itself is about as graphic and violent as one could imagine. The ritual employed by Max Von Sydow's character before he exacts revenge is quite fascinating. Of all Bergman's movies, this is one of the hardest to turn away from and possibly the most depressing. Although there's a lot to pick from.",

I hope you all have seen lots of Revenge Films or at least one in your life so far and mostly with revenge after rape. Here's a task for you, have you even seen a Revenge flick in Art Classic Version which gambles with religious beliefs of a common man and also questions god's willingness over the entire catastrophe? If the answer is No, which i think most probably be, then don't miss this Ingmar Bergman Classic from early 60s. An innocent yet pampered young virgin and her family's pregnant and jealous servant set out to deliver candles to church, but only one returns from events that transpire in the woods along the way. Bergman explored a number of themes in The Virgin Spring, questioning morals, vengeance, and religious beliefs. The rape scene was visually path-breaking for any cinema industry considering the year 1960 because movie-code was very strict and censorship issues were harassing many filmmakers. Yet, Bergman executed the scene in brutal manners and that's why it looked utter realistic and horrible. In the climax, he proved the point that merciless revenge can lead you to commit sins, no matter how necessary it was to from your point view. The kid's character is there to let us all know that frantic actions and blind vengeance are always harmful. The cast members are fabulous, the screenplay is pacy, dialogues are powerful especially in the last 10 minutes and the cinematography is very good. Genius Bergman scores another Merit and that too by picking a normal subject which had been used almost hundreds of times before. Overall, an Art Classic only for those who understands Art Cinema or Bergman Cinema.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",

The three brothers end up spending the night at Karins' parents house. The parents discover that these three men killed their daughter...I'm not a big fan of Bergman's films. I've only seen \"Smiles of a Summer Night\" (which I liked) and \"The Seventh Seal\" (which bored me). This one I did like--but I can't say I enjoyed it. It's very bleak, stark, strange and depressing. All the acting is great (the parents grief is hard to watch) and it's beautifully done--but it was not a pleasure to watch.What the point of all this is is beyond me--it seems to have something to do with faith in God. I personally think it was Bergman's take on a Swedish fairy tale. A very adult and depressing take though. Also the rape and murder are done as tastefully as possible.Remade years later in 1972 as the sick horror film \"Last House on the Left\".",

There's a manufactured hipness and exclusivity quotient at work.It's far less brutal than, say, any one of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films, or even Wes Craven's Last House on the Left, which per Craven was \"inspired\" by Jungfruk\u00e4llan (it's ridiculous to say that Last House is a remake of this film). It's no more poignant or philosophical than, say, Evan Almighty, or even Wild Hogs.However, films like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre entries aren't everyone's cup of tea. Jungfruk\u00e4llan certainly is more stark and minimalist than more recent popular fare, and there is a lot of symbolism at work here--but there is in almost any film. When I say that Jungfruk\u00e4llan is not more philosophical than Wild Hogs, that's not to be negatively critical towards Jungfruk\u00e4llan but to point out that philosophical depth occurs wherever one applies it, and one can apply it to almost anything.Although a decent film with competent performances and some interesting directorial decisions, at this point in time, Jungfruk\u00e4llan is more important for its place in the academic canon and its historical position and influence.",

It also boasts one of Max Von Sydow's most powerful performances - which is saying a lot. Set in a medieval world like 'The Seventh Seal', but here the questions of guilt, god, right and wrong are simpler and less symbolic, and to me ring truer and more emotional. Not that the film doesn't have it's fair share of symbolism. This is still Bergman. But those symbolic gestures feel more a part of a larger story. instead of the point. Some of the supporting performances aren't quite up to Von Sydow's and a couple of key moments felt a bit contrived, but this is a very tense, intense, disturbing and emotional look at one family from another time dealing with issues that are still all too familiar. Indeed there's almost a feeling of horror film about it at moments, and it is, amazingly, sighted as the uncredited basis for Wes Craven's 'The Last House on the Left'!",

            "content": "Rarely has any director done so much in so short a time, or achieved such depth with a story of such simplicity, as Ingmar Bergman in the Virgin Spring. This film, adapted from a medieval ballad, tells of how a fair young maiden was raped and murdered in the forest, and the perpetrators came to spend that very night in the home of her parents. This may sound like the premise for a gory horror film- in fact Wes Craven would later remake this as the shockingly graphic Last House on the Left- but with Bergman there is no question of resorting to shock value, everything is treated with the seriousness and dignity it deserves.There's little more to the plot than what I've already said. Where this film gets its power is from the depth of the characters and their emotions. Karin, the daughter of a wealthy farmer, is one of the purest, most innocent, and most naive girls I have ever seen. She can be a brat, and is the life of any dance, but could never imagine that anyone would hold impure motives or wish her harm. Even as her killers remark upon her beauty, she cannot fathom that she is in any danger 'til it is far too late.The family's servant girl, Ingeri, is Karin's polar opposite. Ingeri is caustic and resentful, her visage scared from a hard life, and her belly swollen with child. She hates Karin with a burning passion which seems born of jealousy. The first time we see her, she is praying to Odin that great misfortune will befall Karin. I can hardly guess what she's been through to make her so embittered at her age, but I pity her.Karin's death is shown openly but not graphically. No doubt is left of what happens to her, or of her assailant's depravity, but there is no nudity or attempt to shock the viewer. The father's revenge is handled in the same manner. The rouges die violently and painfully, but it is done quickly, and with a minimum of blood and gore. They got no less than what they deserved, or at least the older brothers did. The father goes too far in killing the younger brother, who was no more than a child himself. But he realizes this as soon as his rage is passed, and is filled with remorse for what he has done.What left the greatest impression on me was the ending, in which the family sets out to retrieve their daughter's body. Bergman does a masterful job of showing how the father, the mother, and even Ingeri deal with their grief and their perceived guilt as they travel the forest path. But even more powerful is the father's action upon finding the slain body of his only daughter. Falling to his knees he breaks down and shouts to the heavens \"You saw this... You allowed it to happen. I do not understand you. I do not understand you, but still I seek your forgiveness. It is the only redemption I know.In the midst of great tragedy, when he has every reason to despise life and doubt God, he instead turns to faith, and from loss comes renewed commitment, and a symbol of new life. This is what makes Bergman's The Virgin Spring a truly great film.",

But even if that's so, this movie (for me) doesn't rise to the heights to which some people have raised it. I will watch it again, though, and try to see some of the underlying meanings that have been espoused by some reviewers.

            "content": "I watched 'The Virgin Spring' (1960) on TCM today. It's a Swedish film with English subtitles directed by Ingmar Bergman. If the definition of a horror film is one that scares you by what you see and hear in even just a few of the scenes, then this is a horror movie IMO. For instance there is one scene where the sweet and innocent victim realizes what is about to happen to her. That scene for me was spine chilling. Chilling because these horrors really happen, unlike monsters from space or whatever. It was mesmerizing to watch beginning to end, subtitles and all. I was never a big Bergman fan in years past, probably because I didn't devote the time to his films. I'm only now starting to appreciate his vast talent for story telling and imagery. This is one of those times I wish I was a decent writer so I could put into words what I want to express about this story. I''ll put it simply in my words. The story is about a well to do very religious small family in what I took to be the middle ages. The two parents have farmhands, servants and one young, maybe 17 year old, daughter who is their pride and joy. They send their daughter on a short sort of pilgrimage to bring candles to their church. She is expected back that same day. During the course of her short journey she meets with disaster because she is naive about strangers. Later by a strange turn of events, the parents get their revenge for what happens to her. And do that get even ! I don't want to say much more about the plot. I will say it's obvious that the 1972 horror film 'The Last House on the Left' was roughly based on this much superior story. 'TVS' can be taken as a straight plot of loss and revenge or it can be analyzed much deeper. With this story Mr. Bergman makes us think hard about the nature of God, jealousy, vanity, revenge, regret and even forgiveness. It's the kind of film that will stay with you long after it ends. I do my best to keep these comments short, this is getting long, so I'll end by saying 'The Virgin Spring' was an amazing example of film making at its best.",

While the first was abstract and leaning to the artistic side, the latter was a more emotional, personal journey. With \"The Virgin Spring\" though, Bergman repeats the search for a Higher Entity in the context of a revenge tale, exacted by two parents looking to avenge their daughter's death. Is there a God watching us? Should we be careful in each step we take? Should we trust that in Death, all our actions will be balanced? This questions, though, have no possible answers but are only told to make characters react in a hopeless way. Plus, it lacks the moral grandiose that characterizes Bergman's films: here, nothing is learned, ambivalence is powerless, nobody triumphs.

Part of this is, no doubt, due to the fact that the bulk of the film was not written by Bergman, but by novelist Ulla Isaksson, who based her thin script upon a medieval ballad called T\u00f6re's Daughter At V\u00e4nge. The title of the film is a double entendre which refers to the chaste lead character's outing during the springtime, and a rivulet of water that emerges from where her corpse is eventually found by her family after she is raped and murdered. Compared to the films which preceded it, it lacks the emotional heft of The Seventh Seal or Wild Strawberries, and compared to the films that followed it, it lacks the filmic daring of Persona or A Passion. It is an odd film in the Bergman canon, and ranks with Cries And Whispers and The Serpent's Egg as one of the few filmic mediocrities the director ever crafted. Its characters are wooden, almost unintendedly comic, their motivations and reactions are wholly stilted and artificial, and the symbolism is often heavyhanded. Fortunately, it's only an hour and a half in length. It's little wonder that only a dozen or so years later horror filmmaker Wes Craven (and Sean Cunningham) would launch his forgettable career with a film heavily influenced by, if not flat out based upon, it, called Last House On The Left\u0085. Yet, the reason why this film fails to live up to the high standards of most Bergman films- although, by contrast, it's still worlds better than 99.9% of the Hollywood crap churned out today, all boils down to that most important, yet overlooked, reason why all films fail or succeed, and that's because, despite being a visual medium, a film must be well written, with well developed characters and a scenario that can emotionally affect a viewer, be that in the archetypal or realistic vein, to succeed artistically. This film never gets off the stylistic fence and decides whether it is a realistic film nor a symbolic allegory. Thus it fails on both scores, and the bulk of the blame for that can be laid upon the pro-Christian leaning script of the novelist Ulla Isaksson, who wrote an earlier Bergman film, So Close To Life, a few years before. While there is no comparing Wes Craven's 1972 filmic spin on this theme, Last House On The Left, in any cinematic nor artistic terms to The Virgin Spring, in one odd way, Craven's later film does seem more relevant, for it never attempts to find reasons for, nor make sense of, its anomic violence, thus it cannot fail, on that level. Bergman's film asks the big questions, and when its own silence bellows forth no answers, its hollowness only too easily engulfs its own inquisitions, which displays flaws the lesser film could only dream to be vilified for.",

The primary characters are T\u00f6re (Max von Sydow), the straight-laced Christian father who has a soft spot for his daughter, his wife, M\u00e4reta (Birgitta Valberg) who is almost obsessive in her Christian devotion, the teenage daughter, Karin (Birgitta Pettersson), who is pretty, blonde, naive and manipulative to get her way, and her servant girl, Ingeri (Gunnel Lindblom), who is dark, pregnant and has sort of a Raquel Welch look. Ingeri is still pagan, and prays to Odin, a major God in Norse mythology.Karin is dispatched to take candles to the church in preparation for Sunday. Karin asks that Ingeri be allowed to go along, since she doesn't get out much. However, part way along the way Ingeri becomes fearful and stays back, encountering another pagan believer who sexually assaults her. Karin continues on and encounters three herdsman, one of them a boy, who she banters with and offers them part of her lunch. After eating a bit, they rape her and then kill her in a fit of panic. They strip Karin's body of her expensive clothes. Ingeri, who has followed behind, sees it all happen but does not intervene.The three herdsmen in making their escape inadvertently show up at T\u00f6re's home, saying they are on their way south to find more work. He gives them supper in a tableau that looks a lot like the Last Supper, and invites them stay in the room for the night. A bit later one herdsman tries to sell an expensive piece of clothing to M\u00e4reta, who recognizes it as her daughter's. T\u00f6re waits to the morning to take vengeance, killing the two older herdsmen. Despite the pleas of his wife, he throws the boy against the wall also ending in the boy's death.T\u00f6re, M\u00e4reta, Ingeri and all the servants then go to find Karin's body. At the end of the film T\u00f6re has a long address to God: \"You saw it. God, you saw it. An innocent child's death and my vengeance. You allowed it to happen. I don't understand you. I don't understand you. Yet still I ask your forgiveness. I know no other way to make peace with myself than with my own hands. I know no other way to live. I promise, here by the dead body of my only child, as penance I shall build you a church on this spot.\" When they lift Karin's body from the spot where she lay, a spring of water emerges from the ground. M\u00e4reta \"baptizes\" Karin from the water, and Ingeri appears to wash her guilt from her face.Some of the baffling symbols include a crow who appears prominently twice, the use of a toad that Ingeri puts in sandwich for Karin, and T\u00f6re's wrestling with a tree. There are also some musical ditties that don't seem to add to the film.Some commentators have described \"The Virgin Spring\" as the beginning of \"revenge\" movies, though it is more complex than that because of the high levels of guilt felt by both parents and Ingeri. It does not rise to \"Winter Light\" in my favorites list, but it's a fine film.",

I appreciate Ingmar Bergman as a filmmaker but I don't always love his films. He's a great artist but he's often too experimental for me. This is one of his few that I could truly sink my teeth into. It's a Shakespearian tragedy. My only suggestion is that the place of the attack should be a dry desolate location. Being beside a creek makes it a less miraculous ending.",

The family is so well realised that when the rape occurs it is almost unbelievable to think anyone could defile the girl herself. The pacing of the film is well judged and the acting just spot on. The remarkable scene where the mother is handed the garments of her dead daughter, is one of great understatement yet it overflows with emotion. The boy staring up at the night sky wondering his fate and the nightmares to come. The simple direction gets to the heart of the matter. It captures something very well. It captures the surging emotions beneath the surface. The invisible. Nature is close in this film. You can almost touch it. The woods that hide mystery. The water that flows from the point of death. A simple idea. A simple story. Beautifully and superbly executed.",

Bergman made this film in his \"religious\" phase of his career and so here he deals with topics like morality, revenge, religion, envy, good and evil. I think the film later influenced a number of other filmmakers, practically creating a new subgenre, the film of revenge. However, this film still stands out above those because it does not play (only) on the card of shock like almost every other film with a similar theme, he already uses it as an aid.The film is based on an old Swedish thirteenth-century story about a young girl who is raped and killed and how her father gets a chance for revenge. This is the plot in a nutshell and although at first it seems that the film has a simple plot and does not last long, not even ninety minutes, yet the director managed to process so many motives and themes that the film looks very \"rich\" because of its content . The little things and details in certain scenes touched me so much and showed what kind of master Bergman really was.It's almost unbelievable that a film like this came out more than sixty years ago. I believe that it can be talked about and discussed for a very long time. But on the other hand, the film has influenced me so strongly that (from this current perspective) I probably won't watch it again.",

            "content": "The Virgin Spring AKA Jungfrukallan 1/10/2010Swedish director Ingmar Bergman is regarded as on the great film directors of all time. He was nominated for 9 Academy Awards, while also fathering 9 children. He died in 2007 at the ripe old age of 89, but has left a legacy worth remembering. The Virgin Spring was released in 1960 and has since been remade a number of times. Most notably by Wes Craven in his first film \"The Last House on the Left\" which was also remade in 2009 by Dennis Llidis. The story is pretty simplistic but brutally tragic. It deals with such issues as loss of innocence, revenge, religion, crime and punishment.The film is set in 14th century Sweden and centers on a wealthy family in a small rural village. The father, Tore, is played by Swedish actor Max Von Sydow who has had quite a prolific career that started back in the 1940's and is still working today at the age of 80. Maretta is played by Brigitta Valberg, another well known (in her country) Swedish actor. Karin is their fifteen year old daughter. She seems to mirror the rich, pampered, free spirited teenagers of today. She is spoiled and very naive which comes into play later in the film. Maretta is quite the opposite, very reserved and prudish. Her father is a strong man, who loves his family very much. Karin has a step sister named Ingeri, who is her exact opposite in every way. Ingeri is a pregnant servant who prays to the Pagan God Odin for bad things to happen to Karin. This was a time when Christianity and Pagan beliefs were still at odds with each other.Karin is excited to fulfill her duty as the virgin girl who brings the candles to the church. She and Ingeri set off on horse back through the woods to make the delivery when they come across a group of goat herders, two older men and a teenage boy. Karin's innocent trusting nature is completely shattered when the two men rape and kill her. Ingeri hides in the woods and watches the events, she is horrified but passive. The men steal Karin's clothes and stomp on the candles. Her innocence and life have been crushed. The boy of the group doesn't take part in the actions but is quite disturbed by what he has witnessed. The men then unknowingly seek refuge from the elements at Karin's parent's house. Tore and Maretta are gracious hosts until they find out who the men really are. Tore kills the two men in the middle of the night and in a rage kills the boy too. The rapists and Tore have each killed an innocent child, but does that make them the same in the eyes of God? This film has heavy religious overtones throughout. When they find Karin's body in the woods, Tore falls to his knees and although he questions the almighty why his daughter had to die. He promises to build a church on this site as atonement for his killing of the boy. As Maretta lift Karin's body a spring flows forth. Is this a miracle? It's the Virgin Spring a film by Ingmar Bergman. It went on to win Best Foreign Film at the 1961 Academy Awards. Watch for my reviews on the remakes, coming soon.",

            "review_title": "From Horror, Into Light",
            "content": "Thanks to the power of restoration and Criterion, THE VIRGIN SPRING looks like it had been filmed just yesterday instead of nearly 50 years ago. Then again, its cinematography by Sven Nykvist, Ingmar Bergman's frequent collaborator, is nothing short of haunting and expressive and makes even the more horrific passages of the story seem like a dark fairy tale.Adapted from a 13th century ballad, THE VIRGIN SPRING tells the tale of a young girl who embarks on a trip to light some candles for the Virgin Mary with her adopted maid-sister and on the way meets some shepherd boys who rape and kill her. They, in turn, by chance, go by the girl's house where the girl's father enacts a vicious revenge on them.Sounds familiar? It's because it is... Ingmar Bergman's film became a remake twelve years later as THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. Interestingly enough, while Bergman's film is a powerful, gripping tale of the loss of innocence and retribution leading to a rebirth of faith, Wes Craven's film fares just a tad better in its own right, and people who laugh sarcastically at the mention of LAST HOUSE being inspired from Bergman's film are really being snobs. A couple of shots -- especially those dealing with Karin's rape -- are replicated almost exactly in Mari's, the difference being that Mari's close-up with Krug is much more graphic and lasts longer, where Karin's is less focused on debasement than in the deed itself and proceeding to the next act.But in reality, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT exists as its own movie and the slasher genre: this is most definitely not a slasher movie as one that is concerned in bringing forth a tragic tale that through its terrible nature becomes transcendent than in violence for the sake of it. The timing of this filmed fable elevates it beyond the post-Vietnam universe of LAST HOUSE, and because by now Bergman was a visual poet instead of a young director trying to make a name via shock tactics, there is a marked difference between the two.Much of the violence and darkness is implied rather than described in pornographic closeness. Ingeri, for example, may well be the person who has effectively brought down her sister by invoking Odin (she is a pagan) and placing a toad within the folds of bread. As they head out towards the church, she talks ominously of Karin's virtue, strays behind where she winds up in an old lecher's house, and does nothing to save Karin, her facial expressions (and those eyes!) even suggesting she is enjoying Karin's demise. When the father, Tore, comes to avenge his daughter, he first goes through a ritualistic cleansing that is brutal in nature, sits down, emperor-like, as he waits for the men to wake up, and in three swift movements, kills them.The problem of the third (and last) killing is that it's done to a boy no older than ten, at most. But, since he had in fact been responsible for Karin's death as well as the others, and Ingeri's accusation speaks of all three of them participating in her rape, it almost seems justifiable, but would have censors screaming in rage because after all, Tore is killing a boy. Mareta, it seems, is more willing to forgive this boy through her own horror and tries to prevent Tore from a senseless act of murder -- but then again, she is a maternal person; Tore is in full outrage mode and might not respond to reason. Bergman attenuates the sequence by having Mareta sort of reach out to the dead boy, as if she were in her own way asking for forgiveness while forgiving.THE VIRGIN SPRING is an ambiguous film, beautiful to look at, but with a complicated message. A little too emphatic in establishing anything non-Christian as \"dark\", but this is perhaps due to when it was originally written and Bergman sticking to the faithfulness of the story. The actresses playing the sisters are cast according to looks and their natures: Birgitta Pettersson is luminous, blond, a pure maiden, and Gunnel Lindblom is the introspective, \"evil\" sister with a dubious nature. Also with Max von Sydow, a frequent Bergman collaborator, as the father.",

It aspires to be a spiritual journey into the deepest parts of our minds, as it makes the audience question the actions shown in the movie, but it doesn't give any answers itself. This spellbinding creation touches many important and controversial topics, such as selfishness, vengeance, superfluous brutality, sexual assault, and many notions connected with various religion (Paganism, Norse Mythology etc.). It's a deeply disquieting film, which tells a story about a unimaginably beautiful girl, who one day embarks on a journey to the church in order to light the Virgin candles. However, she never makes hit, because of two ruthless thugs, who rape and murder her in front of their young brother. And it's only the beginning. The whole shocking event makes way for a disturbing aftermath, as the killers unknowingly take shelter in the girl's parents' house. When the loving father realizes, who his guests really are, he goes berserk and finishes them off ruthlessly one after another. Even though it's human to say that killing is never the answer, some may argue whether his decision to be the judge and the executioner is justifiable or not. Fantastically paced and compellingly narrated, The Virgin Diaries proves to be a moralizing tale of the most brutal, and at the same time, most powerful kind, showing its purifying nature in the highly-aesthetic visuals.",

Both films have religious themes and both are situated in the Middle ages.There are however also huge differences between the two movies. In \"The seventh seal\" religion = Christianity whereas in \"The virging spring\" the battle beteen paganism and Christianity is still raging in Scandinavia.This battle is symbolised by the real daughter Karin (Birgitta Pettersson) who stands for Christianity and stepdaughter Ingeri (Gunnel Lindblom) who prays to Odin in the beginning of the film and stands for Paganism.At first sight the script seems te prefer Christianity. Karin rides at a white horse, Ingeri has a dark horse. Karin is pure (a virgin), Ingeri is pregnant with no man or boyfriend in sight. By portraying Karin as a spoiled little princess Bergman applies however nuances to this (all too) simple scheme of things.Bergman never considered \"The virgin spring\" a key movie in his oeuvre. In my opinion it was nevertheless important for his carreer because of two reasons. In the first place it gave him his first Oscar for \"Best foreign language movie\" (the next year he would win again in this category with \"Through a glass darkly\" (1961)). In the second place, because his standard cinematographer Gunnar Fischer was occupied in another project, he switched to Sven Nykvist. Nykvist would remain his cinematographer ever since.",

The goatherds in the ballad might have represented the pagan world, as Ingeri represented the world of Norse religion. Karin was killed by the amoral pagan world where only base motivations and instincts are in control. Karin's family represents the finer ethics of Christianity--a newer life view in 13th century Sweden. Man is not so far removed from paganism; and so Store is unable to completely abandon the vengeance of the old ways.One could probably write a paper just about what the writer and director intended by making the changes to the ballad's story. This would illuminate their intentions regarding the film's morality. From their 20th century perspective, the Catholic views of punishment and redemption would much clearer. But the world has had centuries to move past the simplistic philosophic views of the old world. Modern man has challenged the dogma and principles upon which Christianity is based, let alone the individual man's questions to a god that allows evil to exist.I enjoyed this film for its imagery and beautiful B&W photography. The acting was uniformly effective and convincing despite the fact that the characters were symbols for very basic moral roles.Some writers have tried to analyze the story in terms of (sexually) political issues, but their arguments seem contrived. This is a story about primitive emotions and modern attempts to cope with those emotions. It is effective in that.The primary question at the end of the film is whether Store's decision to build a church is relevant. Can every individual choose his own path to redemption? I guess if you believe that the spring is a message from god, then you can believe that man can choose his answer.",

The parents realized the travelers they gave shelter to were murderers, and retribution was swift and bloodless. The father, at the end, could not understand how god could let this happen.

Another problem is the ending: the choice of divine intervention (the miraculous spring that appears when the body is moved) is just not a believable one, it seems Bergman was mistaking the directing chair for the pulpit. One other thing that doesn't sit right, is that the thugs choose to knowingly offer Karin's robe to her family... such is just beyond \u00e1ny reason.On the positive side, Max von Sydow and Birgitta Pettersson present us with some fairly iconic characters, and Bergman's attention to detail (for the most part) is a joy to watch.With a heavy heart, I can't go higher than 5 out of 10.",

            "content": "This has long been my favorite Bergman, and now that I'm in the middle of the thirty-nine films of the Criterion boxset, I think I can begin to understand why.Bergman is an intellectual director, exploring ideas, themes, and people in convincing and compelling ways, but he's rarely a visceral director of experience. We do get moments of compelling truth in Scenes from a Marriage as two people spit vitriol at each other. We do get moments of involving contemplation around the existence of God in Winter Light. However it is in The Virgin Spring that we see Bergman capture an intellectual idea and package it with more spectacle-like filmmaking.One common feature of most of Bergman's films is that they violate the \"rule\" that you must show not tell. His characters talk about what they feel and how they view the world, and the conflicts that arise come from the disparities of those professed values with hidden internal values and values held by other people. In The Virgin Spring, the rule of show don't tell gets followed. It probably has more to do with the novelistic background of the movie's screenwriter, Ulla Isaksson, compared to the theatrical background of Bergman.The story is based on an old Swedish folk tale about a young virgin who is raped and killed on her way to church and the vengeance her father brings down upon those that did the crime. We get all of that action in vivid (though non-graphic) strokes that scandalized critics at the time. The violence is extremely effective even with only the smallest show of blood. There's an emotional effect in those scenes of violence that is as strong as Johan and Marianne screaming at each other at the nadir of their relationship in Scenes from a Marriage, but the violence here is physical and visceral. It seems to dig just a bit deeper.The standouts of that violence made the contemporary New York Times critic say that the movie was a thin morality tale below Bergman's talents, but there's actually so much more. What is there just isn't spoken about, but it lingers in the background of everything. The conflict between the paganism of Odin and the monotheism of the new Christianity isn't a stand-in for a simplistic good vs. evil battle. Instead, there are interesting shades within each character that drive the ideas even further. The father, Tore, obviously clings to his old pagan ways and has been dragged into the new Christianity by his wife Mareta. Their daughter, Karin, is beautiful and eager to look her best for her mission to deliver candles to the church, but she is also haughty, entitled, and manipulates her parents with ease. Ingeri, the pregnant Odin worshiper the family has taken in as a ward, prays for Karin's defilement but confesses to Tore after the crime and begs for the punishment Tore will mete out to the perpetrators.Where this movie stands out in Bergman's filmography most for me is the thematic thrust of the film. The Virgin Spring came out in 1960, just a few years after the existential The Seventh Seal and right before the Silence Trilogy, and yet the thematic point isn't a form of rejection of religion. In fact, the titular spring is an embrace of the idea that man's concept of God, as manifested by the Church, is correct. It's a natural extension of the story he was trying to tell, but also an artifact of the fact that he didn't actually write the movie. God is still silent in the face of the violence placed upon the innocent Karin, but the existence of the spring that shoots from where her lifeless head had laid for a day, opening up immediately after Tore had promised to build a church of mortar and stone on the spot, is God's communication. He speaks more in that than in anything else Bergman made.",

His films are beautiful, unsettling, and, sometimes, quite disturbing. \"The Virgin Spring\" fits into all three of those categories.The inspiration for Wes Craven's \"The Last House on the Last on the Left\", this is probably the first film of the rape-and-revenge sub genre. The scenes depicting both the rape and the revenge are very unsettling and awfully shocking for a film made in 1960!While it deals with ugly content and subject matter, it looks stunning, and it is shot in beautiful black and white! Rarely is there a film that is so hard to watch, yet so lovely to look at, at the same time. It is probably one of the best looking films of all time, but so are all of the other Ingmar Bergman films I've seen!",

            "content": "This is a picture with a gradual flow that one can truly feel as it happens. It evolves step by step: working its way up and then deconstructing itself down. What also helps lock in a viewer is a share of the film isn't scored but instead lets natural sounds and pictures of nature speak through black and white imagery that way to develop a certain ambiance. The style of direction feels loose when there's emotion to evolve and then in others it can be deliberate and calculated in the way no detail is frivolous or unaccounted for.\"The Virgin Spring\" starts out like every other day in this small Swedish town in the Middle Ages, though as it moves along it slowly turns more and more devastating due to an event that caught everyone by unawares. These simple folk come from a different era with different customs and professions, though they get hit with a tragic set of circumstances that can still translate and relate to the modern day person wherever a viewer comes from.Life is here one moment, gone the next. Our time on Earth is about survival, as the chaotic ways of our environment can give and take at anytime. Letting your guard down is something that we all wish we could do, but the moment we get bit we'll be covering up in preparation for the next time, just in case. What makes this film so sad is that it shows that even the most treacherous occurrence can happen to those full of heart and passion. Being innocent, unselfconscious and a free spirit should be things that we should all be able to openly enjoy and experience. Though as most adults learn: there are those that are willing to take advantage and step on what you've built up in the blink of an eye.Karin, a young, blonde maiden, is one such person who's prospects are far reaching with possibilities. She's a rare type that gives off a radiating spark to brighten those around her. The father is protective of Karin, while the mother softer due to it being her only child. As a result the girl is somewhat spoiled, fanciful and naive: ultimately not ready for the harsh realities of the outside world. She wakes up late and is given the small task of bringing candles to the church as per a virginal ceremony with her servant Ingeri. During her trek through the woods, Karin meets three brothers who look poverty stricken and from hard times. Expect they have an ulterior motive even when she offers to give them food and have a picnic. In the flash of a tranquil moment, things turn for worst as they want her for her body and belongs instead as Ingeri looks on as a silent witness from afar. When the three brothers seek shelter, they stumble into the last people they want to meet: Karin's relatives.This has a fairly quick rape scene compared to what's to come with films in the '70s that would make a formula out of this and turn it into the rape/revenge subgenre. It's ugly and manipulative, sure, but it's also an impulsive, spur of the moment action. That way to concentrate more so on the after effects from putting little forethought into the selfish act on the rapist's part and also the servant who willed it at first but became panic stricken when actually played out. Max von Sydow rightfully plays the master of the house named Tore with a looming stance and stern face that commands when needed. His actions and expressions are subtle enough to translate what his thoughts are without having to say it outright. Gunnel Lindblom, as Ingeri, has the most complex role in the film. She's the black sheep of the family, always expected to do wrong and never appreciated when actually doing right: so what's the point of making an effort? The result is she acts misplaced and never really part of something with a sense of security.\"The Virgin Spring\" is a challenging tale that unveils beauty and then breaks down the meticulous ruination of it. The film shows some of the effects of not having restraint, whether it's with hate, physical attraction or violence. It deals with choice: whether to swallow your pride and move on or easily give into current emotions and instant desires. It involves opposing ideals about forgiveness and revenge, as the family is turning towards Christian ways as opposed to traditional Pagan. This begins without a bad guy, gains a few in the middle and by its close the film will have you questioning whether the good ones that got thrown into the horrible situation are any more right in how they wrapped it up. This is an incredibly well-done and poignant picture, though not something to watch lightly even if it reveals a glimmer of hope that can be passed on. This was expertly paced, acted in a natural fluidity--like graceful stage actors than typical cinema performers--as well as the period decoration puts one there to live and feel as these basic people did, so when the events take place, it made them that much more powerful.

            "content": "Another chipper valentine of a movie from Ingmar Bergman. Light a fire, cozy up with a loved one, and spend a romantic evening together with the ultimate date night movie.Seriously though, \"The Virgin Spring\" is an excellent film, but sheesh. What a brutal, nearly nihilistic movie this is. In a plot that might seem very familiar to a bunch of people who have seen \"The Last House on the Left,\" a young, virginal woman is raped and murdered out in the woods, and then her attackers find themselves being given food and shelter in her family's home. Once the dad (Max von Sydow in an intense and bracing performance) discovers who they are, he exacts his revenge.This movie is about how awful human beings can be to one another, and how very feeble religious convictions about being good and kind are when up against some of the terrible things the world will throw at us. The only thing that will keep the film from being utterly demoralizing for most viewers is the ending, but I found it to be a noxious load of crap. It reminded me of the feeling I had after watching \"Breaking the Waves,\" where a couple of hours of what felt like torture porn was capped with and ending in which we're told the suffering and casual disposal of a young woman is worth it because it brings those around her closer to God. Yuck.So I can't deny that this movie is excellently made, and it may be very powerful for those who have religious faith. As for me, I could admire the filmmaking but felt punished by the movie and was glad it wasn't any longer.Grade: A-",

Consequentially, Karin is doted on by her mother with fancy apparel and other liberties, and errs on the side of being naive, a symbol of Prelapsarian innocence.

            "content": "The Virgin Spring is a film riddled with religious symbolism and beautiful imagery, but it's also an incredibly heartbreaking film and the closest thing I've seen to a Bergman action movie. The best part of this film, like almost all of Bergman's films, comes with the metaphors. Bergman was raised Lutheran, and over his career he struggled with his faith. A crisis of faith is a constant theme that he wrestles with, and this film is similar in that regard. The Virgin Spring tackles a heavier topic; why does God allow bad things to happen to good people, and can good things come out of horrible circumstances. This film, while bleak and horrible to watch at times, comes with an underlying theme of salvation and redemption.\nThe biggest metaphor in this film is crossing the river. Crossing the river, in this film, is essentially death. On one side of the river is life, the river itself represents hell or death without salvation, and the opposite side of the river represents heaven or a place with God's presence. There is a scene after the rape, before Tore's revenge, when the monk (or Beggar as IMDb lists him) talks to the youngest Herdsman, and he explains this whole metaphor in great detail while trying to save the boy's soul. It's everything I could want from a Bergman film. It's a simple story, but it's unique and has many meaningful layers. Bergman was a genius, and if you are unfamiliar with his work, this is a fine place to start.",

            "review_title": "An unforgettable film about loss and revenge",
            "content": "In 1960, a financially bankrupt Ingmar Bergman accepted a job to direct a film from a script by cult-novelist Ulla Isaksson. The result was one of the greatest films of the decade. With The Virgin Spring, Bergman presents us with an unforgettable work of almost intimate beauty and juxtaposing horror; with every frame overflowing with rich, symbolic detail, an enormous sense of narrative momentum, and an emotionally raw approach to the writing and performances.Although this predates the radical Persona (1966), his fondness for the use of heavily symbolic composition and highly expressive close-ups was already at the fore, with only a few noticeable wide-shots used sparingly. The effect that this has is often devastating, creating a tight, claustrophobic atmosphere in which every character seems to embody the very essence of physical oppression; that is, of course, with the exception of the virginal Karin, who becomes the very vessel of beauty and innocence within the film. Here, Bergman says more about Karin and her relation to the story in one shot than a lesser filmmaker could with a ten minute prologue, whilst the performance itself from the actress Birgitta Pettersson exists on a level somehow above the boundaries of reality; simply reinforcing the idea of her character as being a symbol within the film's landscape of medieval despair.The film also benefits greatly from the performances of Max von Sydow and Birgitta Valberg as Karin's dutiful parents; with Bergman using that amazing knack of pushing his actors into seriously intense emotional states, as evident in his more iconic films such as Through a Glass Darkly (1961), Persona (1966) and Cries and Whispers (1973). Here, von Sydow turns in a performance that few actors could equate, with a slow-building depiction of escalating menace and cathartic violence to rival that of De Niro's in Taxi Driver (1975) or Paddy Considine in Dead Man's Shoes (2005). Seriously, if you thought he was impressive as Father Merrin in The Exorcist (1973) or Antonius Block in The Seventh Seal (1957), then take a good look at the last twenty-minutes of the film in question, in which von Sydow's character T\u00f6re prepares himself for an almost biblical eruption of violent retribution.As ever, Bergman is also aided in his creation of this world of continually juxtaposing light and dark by his genius cinematographer of choice, Sven Nykvist, who shoots the film in glorious black and white. It's a wonderful contrast that one may feel obliged to call beautiful if it wasn't for the constantly gritty atmosphere suggested by the authentic production design or the sense of violence and loss so central to the script.The Virgin Spring is, for me at least, a film teaming with detailed composition. The most startling images come towards the end of the film, as T\u00f6re succumbs to the worst kind of insanity; controlled, mannered, and all the more dangerous. The intensity in his eyes as he realises that the men who have taken shelter in his home have destroyed the one remaining beacon of beauty in his life is astounding. In one of the most memorable sequences, he wrestles with a birch tree during a thunderstorm, uprooting it, breaking the branches off as if they were limbs, and then literally whipping himself into a total frenzy as he prepares himself for revenge. This is a film that will remain with you for a long time; offering the viewer an honest look at loss, revenge and innocence destroyed. The final scene is enigmatic and tinged with religious symbolism and confirmation of faith, and, as a result, could be seen as something of a bum-note in an otherwise perfect work of art.However, this isn't to say that such an ending destroys the impact of the film, with the culmination of T\u00f6re's retribution and the symbolism of the opening sequences suggesting the futility of violence against violence and the images of nature being something both beautiful and deadly. Sufficed to say, The Virgin Spring, unlike certain other Bergman films, offers the viewer a light at the end of the tunnel; with the image of retribution and a prevailing notion of faith.",

            "content": "\"The Virgin Spring\" is in my opinion one of the greatest Period Dramas ever made and the greatest Swedish movie ever. Beautifully shot, paced and directed it is bound to haunt anyone watching it for days. It is the second and last movie Bergman made which was set in the middle ages, and for me at least appears to be a sign of Bergman reaching closure in his struggles with his questions of life, death and the after world. Human life was cheap in the middle ages but if \"The Seventh Seal\" represented a positive view of mans ultimate demise, \"The Virgin Spring\" offers nothing but darkness. In \"The Seventh Seal\" no one was safe from death but in the end death came firstly to those who wanted to die (the Knights, The Blacksmith and his wife) and life to those who wanted to live (the Actors.) It was not logical but supposedly just.In \"The Virgin Spring\" the same premise is turned on its head. In any movie from the same period, the character of Ingeri would have been doomed. She is ugly, crude, pregnant and she is in league with a Pagan god. Usually she would have been destroyed by the force she had conjured. But this does not happen. Instead death comes to the beautiful, virginal and Christian Karin, without any reason or explanation at all. God is silent. \"The Virgin Spring\" is proof of what a virtuosic director Bergman was. The classic theatrical feeling of his movies is mixed with elements of Thriller, Horror, Western and Japanese \"Jidai Geki\". The final fight between T\u00f6re and the sheep herders is not your typical Swashbuckling, Errol Flynn fencing match. T\u00f6re wakes them up because he wants it to be a fair fight but other than that it is pure murder. Unfortunately in my opinion, Bergamn never reached this level of greatness again, more or less completely abandoning period drama. But \"The Virgin Spring\" stands as one of the finest moments in Swedish cinema ever.",

It's based on a local legend that tells of a chain of brutal events and a miracle that led to the construction of a church at K\u00e4rna. Bergman's version stays true to the main gist but changes several points, adding much more brutality (rape) as well as several very interesting characters (the jealous servant, the supernatural bridge keeper, the young boy caught up in the carnage), resulting in far more than a simple legend. What we get here is an epic morality tale that touches on themes of pride, vengeance, remorse and penance.The film opens on the jealous servant praying to Odin, cursing the beautiful young daughter of the house. Odin later grants the curse much to the servant's sudden horror. Matters quickly escalate, and when the father of the house T\u00f6re (Max Von Sydow) weighs in, we get a chilling depiction of a man with a righteous vendetta.There is a ton of symbolism in this film which is what makes it so powerful. You may not catch some of it particularly if you're not versed in the local folklore, such as the bridge keeper being Odin, or as another reviewer keenly noted that each character represents one of the 7 deadly sins. There's a ton going on, not to mention the excellent cinematography and lighting in the shadowy cottage where much of the story takes place. And Max Von Sydow's range of acting from stoic husband, to kind hearted father, to wrathful avenger is riveting to watch. Unlike Bergman's earlier works, there is very little humor here if at all.

The film was engaging. The setting was a pretty dreary medieval place inhabited by rabidly devout Christians. There didn't seem to be too many bars there or any fun activities like hard drinking going on. So there are these two women - one a pregnant older lady and another an innocent young girl. The way the Christian family treats the two women underlines their prejudices. The pregnant lady is portrayed as lustful and gluttonous. The younger lady is slothful but also very noble. Her act of Christian kindness leads to her rape and murder. The rape scene while not very graphic was pretty tough to watch as the two degenerates sort of pushed each other away to get at the girl first. It was quite unpleasant to watch. There was a lot of intellectual stuff and biblical talk - all of which I did not understand. Including the ending. Best Regards, Pimpin. (7/10)",

The clear outline, the uncomplicated distinction of good and evil of the story is set against Bergman's own messed up personal life. Under those conditions, a true masterpiece came into being, touchingly and cleverly staged. Nykvist endows us once again with congenially modest, as well as staggering images, takes and tracking shots which all have a strong iconic meaning: Beginning with the scene where Ingeri snuggles up to a pole, to images which adapt the Last Supper and to wonderful panning shots of the girl's ride to the church - and the final scene could be Bergman's most spirital one of all his films.",

            "content": "Max von Sydow and Birgitta Valberg are prosperous, devout Christian farmers in 14th century Sweden, who send their daughter Birgitta Pettersson to the nearby town to deliver candles for a religious observance. She encounters three itinerant goat herder brothers (Axel D\u00fcberg, Tor Isedal and Ove Porath) along the way. She is friendly and shares her lunch with them, but they attack and rape her, killing her in the aftermath and leaving her corpse in a forest clearing.The three end up seeking shelter for the night at Von Sydow's farm, and they inadvertently reveal what has happened by trying to sell some of her belongings to Valberg. Von Sydow quietly and methodically kills all three in reprisal.This film has a cold and terrible poetic beauty. It doesn't really portray the goat herders as evil men, so much as brute facts ... part of the wild uncultured world that Von Sydow lives in. The film pits Von Sydow's somewhat primitive Christian faith against the brutish aspects of the world, turning the story into a crisis of faith narrative. How does a man living in this times reconcile his beliefs with the terrible things the world inflicts on him?",

The performances are excellent, and black-and-white photography has never looked so good. Thematically similar to Cocteau's \"Belle et la Bete.\"  Definitely a must-see.",
