            "content": "Hiroshima is at the heart of this deceptively simple story. Hiroshima not only as the city which received the fatal bomb on the morning of August 9, 1945, at 9:15 AM, but Hiroshima as the city of Nevers which the woman tries to escape from (but ultimately can't), and Hiroshima as the Japanese man with whom she is having a clandestine affair. The tragedy of the past dresses and undresses them like the ashes seen at the beginning of the film, superimposed on the glistening sweat from the protagonists' lovemaking... an act that will not be repeated after, or throughout the movie. Theirs is an affair that will remain devoid of a fulfilling consummation.We don't know much about these two people in the beginning: She (Emmanuelle Riva) is in Hiroshima filming scenes for an anti-war movie; he lost his family to the bombing and knows of the pain and the inconsolable loss. The Actress tells him (Eiji Okada) she knows of loss as well, and can identify. At first, we don't know what is under her skin, or why she calmly tells him there will be no more meetings, that he will go away. It is his staying, faithful, by her side, that causes her to slowly peel away at the layers of pain that have lingered just under the surface for 14 years now, eating at her, wanting some form of exorcism.Rarely has there been such naked intimacy told or filmed on screen in such unconventional manner, de-glamorizing the actors, almost depersonalizing their egos, for the sake of telling a story that took place years ago, but is still present in her mind and soul and is still happening, in an endless repetition, over and over again. Being in Hiroshima only intensifies her grief and overall isolation. Knowing the affair must eventually end and that they will go back to their lives practically turns her to stone in one scene, as morning arrives.Here is the real tragedy of the story: that we have come to care for both of these people, that they have somehow formed a bond that has been able to rise, like Hiroshima, from the ashes of the past, but that the isolation and inner torment that still rages prevents there being any simple solution -- no Hollywood ending where She will carry out her impulsive decision (that she makes one, to stay, is here, but only in desire, not action), and from what little we still know of Him, no statement that He will leave his unseen, unnamed wife. They will part, and her exclamation near the end: \"I am forgetting you already!\" is an act, a defense mechanism. She hasn't forgotten the incident at Nevers (which becomes her symbolic name at the end), nor will she forget this man whom at the end has named himself Hiroshima, in remembrance.",

            "content": "As a college freshman some 45 years ago, I saw this film in the student union They had a commitment to art films. I have to say that I do remember the stream of dialog between the two characters but little about the content. I knew he (the Japanese man) had lost his family on that August day. I recall her pulling inward as he becomes a bit demanding. Watching it with mature eyes and a fresh view of the world, I was brought back to these two traumatized characters and the war that changed them forever. It begins with a discussion of the Hiroshima museum which contains pictures and artifacts from that fateful day. He keeps telling her that she has not seen Hiroshima as they lay entwined in bed. His pain is more predictable. He lost his family that day while he was away. Hers takes a more melancholy road. As she opens up, she tells the story of a love affair with a German soldier whom she would meet in all manner of places. One day she found him dying, curled up on the ground. She sits with him until he dies. New of their trysts gets out and she is ostracized by her community, her hair cropped, beaten, and thrown in a cellar by her own family. She has not told this story to anyone, including her own husband, until now. While she feels somewhat liberated the pain is too deep. The Japanese man, also married, wants her to stay in Hiroshima. The movie is about the relationship going forward with such damaged people. She repeatedly tries to escape him, but he keeps resurfacing. The sad thing is that she desires him and so it's not as if she is being stalked. Resnais is a master with the camera, using black and white contrasting images, engaging flashbacks, close-ups. One really marvelous scene is where the young woman, who has been playing a small part in an anti-war film, is nearly trampled by protesters carrying signs. Hiroshima is constantly in her face. She has been hurt so badly by the war and is carrying a load of guilt. War carries with it a loss of innocence and pain beyond the obvious. This film really captures this.",

Even people used to international cinema may find themselves somewhat boggled by this visual tone poem. It's beautiful, and it leaves a distinct impression, but it does so in the way that a striking and unexpected image would, not in the way that an accessible film narrative would. Therefore, it interests without ever fully engaging.To say that Resnais' film has something in common with silent cinema would be misleading, because sound certainly matters. But the movie definitely feels like a piece of non-verbal cinema, where sensation matters more than cognition.A movie I probably need to see again to truly appreciate.Grade: A",

They meet in Hiroshima fifteen years after August 6, 1945 and become lovers when she came there to working on an antiwar film. They both are hunted by the memories of war and what it does to human's lives and souls. Together they live their tragic past and uncertain present in a complex series of fantasies and nightmares, flashes of memory and persistence of it. The black-and-white images by Sasha Vierney and Mikio Takhashi, especially the opening montage of bodies intertwined are unforgettable and the power of subject matter is undeniable. My only problem is the film's Oscar nominated screenplay. It works perfectly for the most of the film but then it begins to move in circles making the last 20 minutes or so go on forever.",

            "content": "Memory has persistently troubled filmmakers, this facet of consciousness by which the past overwrites the present. Where do these images come from, at what behest? More importantly, by invoking memory, how can we hope to communicate to others this past experience, which only perhaps existed once? The woman says she saw Hiroshima, the charred asphalt and scorched metal, the matted hair coming out in tufts. We may have seen the same anonymous images of disaster, elsewhere, and think we saw. We see other people like her, like ourselves as mere spectators of a film, walk around the a-bomb museum in Hiroshima among the relics of disaster, lost in thought, impotent to reconstruct the experience from these glassed remnants of it. One of the great metaphors of memory, this museum that houses and presents fragmentary what used to be and how the spectators merely move inside it\u2014internal observers of images.The woman says she saw Hiroshima, but we know she didn't really experience. We know by the same images we may have seen, and which we see again in the film. We know this from our own private efforts to relive time gone. We see the objects and sounds but not having walked among them, we only know them vicariously. Can we ever get to know through cinema for that matter? The great contribution of Resnais to cinema is firstly this, the realization that this medium is inherently equipped to inherit the problem of memory\u2014just what is this illusory space. Inherently equipped in the same breath to fail to recapture the world as it was, like memory. Where Godard would be in thirty years, Resnais\u2014and his friend Chris Marker\u2014already was with his debut. He gives us here a more poignant, intelligent disclaimer of the artificiality of cinema than Godard ever did. The woman is of course an actress starring in a film\u2014about peace we find out. But Hiroshima is not the simple ploy of a trickster, it enters beyond.We see in Hiroshima how the past forms that make up life as we have known it, and in which the self was forged, come into play. How these things, a past love or suffering thought to matter at the time, are only small by the distance of time. That we weren't shattered by them.And we see how, having been, these forms will vanish again. How this present love and perhaps the suffering that will follow it, thought to matter now, will also come to pass and be forgotten. How we will perhaps try to recount these events at a future time, our reconstructions faced with the same impotence to make ourselves known or know in turn. All that remains then, having walked the city in an effort to shape again from memory, is this moment, perhaps shared by two people on a bed. These walks taken together. Perhaps a story to tell or a film about it.Something to meditate upon.",

Seeing it now gives me great, great appreciation for what it is. And though I have been previously exposed, it washed over me all over again.It has a laconic pace. Usually, one leverages this for relaxation into nature. Robert Redord. Here it relaxes into a tension of a different order, a quiet insistent striving for connection, like \"In the Mood for Love.\" In this case though, the filmmaker has turned that yearning sideways so you have three dimensions of pull.You have the desire for romance, here presented in a way that is more engaging than usual because of its folding into the other dimensions. You have the desire to comprehend war, war defined here as the sacrifice of innocents and war as a sort of incomprehensible desire running in parallel to all the other incomprehensible desires we see, every one.And you have the desire of a film to reach into the inner world of ourselves. Film itself is a character here, with its own desires and doubts. The three of these fold in such a way that as we spend time with them we have to fill it by pouring ourselves into the film because it pulls story from us rather than serving it in timely patter.Its an open world, made open by providing an amazing skeleton, on which we are surprised to find our own flesh and our own wondering about next actions.He, an architect, she an actress, both highly cinematic beings. Both in Hiroshima with folded cranes over dying souls in beds. Both, this is us now, wondering, shall we do it? Shall she stay? What will it mean? Surely that the world will not be saved, not even a little, not even that they may try. Or will they? Should they?This is such an open framework that not only do you pour yourself into it, but other filmmakers can and do. You owe it to yourself to see \"H Story.\" after this. Or better, before.

            "content": "This film has been compared to \"Citizen Kane,\" not because of the story itself, but the way it is told, and through innovative artistic devices. The screenplay is highly poetic even when describing destruction, death, and madness.  Several jump cuts in time occur with voice-over, and, at the beginning, voice-over during a montage of frightening images from the aftermath of the Hiroshima bombing and the bodies of the two lovers in bed. The characters represent different cities; the Japanese man, Hiroshima, the French woman, a city in France, Nevers (was this intentional?), but the latter might as well represent any outside nation.  While \"Hiroshima,\" even after being destroyed by an \"ally\" of France, falls in love with her and wants her to stay, despite his claims that she can never know what the bombing was really like, yet leaving this in the past without forgetting, \"France\" is hung up on a dead Nazi soldier whom she had loved, and became an outcast because of it.  What the soldier really seems to represent is not the Nazis, but rather a real, true love that transcended nationalities and associations.  France's past is personal and fears forgetting it, while Hiroshima's is communal and, while not wanting to forget, also wants to move ahead.  For this reason Hiroshima keeps trying to convince France to stay so that they can be in love, but France is too preoccupied with its own personal ghost that it cannot share, which is why it is a major breakthrough for her when she tells her tragic story for the first time to anyone, Hiroshima.  Hiroshima's past tragedy being communal is shared and it wants to share with the rest of the world.  France's tragedy is personal and is only beginning to be shared.  It takes the entire film before the two characters can get to a beginning of something more than their differences and likenesses of tragedy and loss in the past, and this beginning is who they really are, in the present, two people reborn from these tragedies.",

It is too daring by its conventional moral standards, distinguished in the way it was done, written, made and executed...\"Hiroshima, Mon Amour\" is about the fortitude of man, with its mental and physical power...

            "content": "The \"Rendezvous with French Cinema\" in town is a four-month affair, showing ONE French film every Sunday at 9:40 p.m. I watched two of these back to back, first \"Playtime\" to which I attached \"Artwork\" as my summary line, then \"Hiroshima, Mon Amour\". While both fit the description of \"a piece of artwork\" they cannot be more different: one is dead serious, the other wickedly playful. And yet, there are similarities aplenty. While apparently without a traditional \"story\" or \"plot\", both are meticulously constructed and amazingly intact. Visually, both are exquisitely shot.\"Hiroshima, Mon Amour\" shows the audience the interaction and communication between a French woman (key role) and a Japanese man (supporting role) within a duration of two days in Hiroshima \u0096 \"She\" (Emmanuelle Riva) and \"He\" (Eiji Okada) as they are referred to in the credits. Two of the most talked about aspects of this film are its treatment of time and the montage during the first 20 minutes.On the aspect of temporal juggling, while it was considered ground breaking at the time it was shot, with only \"Citizen Kane\" to compared to, it is today much less avant-garde. Still, some critics have taken this aspect further, interpreting this as not only a play on time, but also on reality. Some suggest that when \"She\" talks about her German lover 14 years ago, in her hometown Nevers, it is not even clear whether it is something in the past and real, or in the present and imaginary.The montage in the first 20 minutes is what fascinates me most in this film. With frames alternating between the lovers in an intimate embrace after lovemaking and horrendous images of the aftermath of Hiroshima, we hear voice-over of their discussion of the horrors of the bombing. While the co-existence of two consciousness is apparent, there could be three, as the voice-over dialogue could well have been juxtaposed from yet another scene.As a statement on the horrors of atomic warfare, HMA is visually effective. For portraying the somber and chilling reality, however, it is a far cry from \"On the beach\" which was made in the same year, even when the latter is fictional. Suggestions have also been made that HMA lacks in context, in that someone not familiar the history may get the impression that the Japanese are victims, rather than aggressors, of the Second World War.Another aspect, equally if not more important, is looking at everything from the point of view of \"She\". It could be that her haunting past, which includes a period of insanity, prevents her from accepting his proposal for a stable relationship. But then even in the present context, this is an extra-marital relationship between a married man and a married woman. But the whole thing can be quite symbolic. Very suggestive, but not necessarily revealing, is the rather abrupt ending, when \"She\" suggests that \"He\"'s name is \"Hiroshima\". \"She\"'s name would then be \"Nevers\", \"He\" responds.",

            "content": "A poetic and haunting film about the tragedy of death, the ability people have of picking up the pieces and moving on, and yet history inexorably repeating itself, both in individual lives and with mankind. It's got an undercurrent of anti-war messaging in it as we see the horrifying results of the atomic bomb in graphic detail, but the film is more than that. The cinematography is beautiful, both in Hiroshima and the Loire Valley, and director Alain Resnais tells the story brilliantly via flashbacks and meaningful little moments, those which would stand out in one's memory. The premise is fairly simple: a French woman (Emmanuelle Riva) has a short affair with a Japanese man (Eiji Okada) while she's in Hiroshima acting in a film, but both of them know it's short-lived. They're both married, she's due to fly back to France, and she confesses that she's never gotten over a forbidden affair she had as a teenager with a German soldier fourteen years earlier, during the war. She's still traumatized by this, so much so that she sees this new lover as a version of the man she knew from the past, and a pale version at that. As she speaks about it, she uses pronouns as if she were still talking to her old lover, and we can see from the flashbacks just how crushed she was - driven to madness, shunned by the French townspeople as a traitor, and made to live silently in a cold cellar by her parents. It's a harrowing tale.The love she has in Hiroshima has some incredible erotic moments, even if they are brief and restrained. Keep an eye on Emmanuelle Riva's hands in this film as she caresses him; they are so loving. And yet, the film is quite brutal in its honesty, and he's forced to hear both her memories from the past and, towards the end, see another man approach her, visualizing how replaceable he is. He's just a link in a chain for her, just as she is for him. \"I meet you. I remember you. Who are you?\" she says, and \"I don't mind being like a thousand women to you.\" It's a cynical view of love that may leave you cold, particularly as Marguerite Duras' script borders on pretentiousness at times.In putting the tragedy of a single soldier's death next to the death of hundreds of thousands of people at Hiroshima, it reinforces how tragic all of those lives lost were; they all had their own stories, even if in both cases they were part of \"the enemy.\" However, it's even more tragic when we reflect that mankind will move on, soon forget, and repeat the same mistakes, just as lovers move on, soon forget, and meet new lovers. We see a dual to the horror of forgetting war when he says \"Some years from now, when I have forgotten you and other romances like this one have recurred through sheer habit, I will remember you as a symbol of love's forgetfulness. This affair will remind me how horrible forgetting is.\" This is echoed in her lines \"Just as in love, there is this illusion, this illusion that you will never be able to forget, the way I had the illusion, faced with Hiroshima, that I would never forget.\" Forgetting to some extent is necessary to heal and move on even when it seems impossible, and yet it can also be inevitable, and render what we forget meaningless. It's interesting to think about.One of the little scenes early on that I loved was when he visits her 'peace movie' set, and the two of them begin talking. As she smiles at him in the sunshine, a demonstrator walks by carrying a picture of a victim of the bombing, which is a somber juxtaposition, and yet so subtly executed by Resnais. There are countless other moments, including when we see the various places she and the German soldier find to carry on with each other, which has overtones of cheapness and lust, and yet, also love trying to find a way in an impossible time. Just as she's irreparably damaged by the love of her life's death, so mankind seems irreparably changed after the Hiroshima bombing. What a fascinating response she has to his question about what Hiroshima meant to her: \"The end of the war... completely, I mean. Astonishment that they dared, astonishment that they succeeded. And for us, the start of an unknown fear. Then, indifference. And fear of that indifference.\" It's an existential moment in a brave new world, and perhaps that's what this film really is - an existential romance, one that is devastating.",

            "content": "Hiroshima Mon Amour is brilliantly made and brilliantly acted, with a thoughtful, poetic script by the great French writer, Marguerite Duras. Its images are lyrical, disturbing, fascinating, and its anti-war message is profound and still frighteningly relevant. But in terms of strict entertainment...Any film which begins with abstracted images of the entwined body parts of human lovers, slowly becoming encrusted with ash and (presumably) atomic fallout... and then spends an obscure 15 minutes arguing about the death and disfigurement of multitudes during the atomic bomb blast in Hiroshima, and the nature of memory and forgetfulness... well, you realize immediately that this movie isn't set up to go anyplace fun. Unless your idea of \"fun\" is witnessing someone else's graphic misery without the cleansing catharsis that accompanies a more conventional tragedy. Hey, some people enjoy that kind of thing! Not me, but to each his/her own.Despite a structure which is famous for meandering through time, the film's narrative is fairly cogent and non-confusing, which is a plus. But the central illicit, inter-racial affair between a French actress and the Japanese architect whom she hooks up with during a film shoot in Hiroshima... It doesn't really make any sense. From the tiny acorn of a chance hookup, grows a mad-passionate love affair based almost entirely on memories dredged from the actress' past, which she disgorges to the architect, rather like a colorless Scheherezade, as she loses all rational connection to the present, conflating a youthful indiscretion with a deceased German soldier (and her subsequent descent into madness) with the non-happenings surrounding her current Japanese amour. German, Japanese... clearly, she can't tell these Axis races apart! I understand that the point of the film was not to create strict narrative coherence, but rather to delve into some kind of symbolic and psychic clash between this cold-yet-overwrought union of a French woman and her obsessed Japanese lover, and the horrors of War. But, despite some moments which are outright absurdist in effect, the overall tone of the film is grinding in its humorlessness. As I watched the characters fatalistically surrendering to their doom, all I could think was, \"man, that Marguerite Duras must have been a drag to be romantically involved with.\" I mean, the Duras script, for all it's poetic symbolism and intellectual brilliance, etc etc, tells a story of people who are criminally passive and hopelessly clingy. Love seems to transform her characters into mere victims, of love, of war, of life, masochistically reveling in their own operatic suffering while doing virtually nothing. As the nameless SHE recalls her own suffering during her madness, scraping her fingertips off on the saltpeter-encrusted walls of her parent's cellar-prison, then receiving validation of existence by luxuriously sucking her own blood from her ravaged hands because otherwise she is utterly alone, all I could think was... Oh brother! This character is so badly damaged, how did she ever manage to get happily married before she embarked on this chance affair in Japan? The imagery is fabulous and intense, but are these really human beings that could have plausibly embarked on a journey together? One human being, actually, because the Japanese architect is little more than a handsome cipher of \"love\"... love, in this story, apparently meaning the obsession that arises from the act of physical copulation, an experience which is equated with destruction of the nuclear holocaust variety. So, Marguerite Duras clearly had issues surrounding her expression and experience of sexuality. And the film betrays little in the way of empathy, either, the characters are infused with an undercurrent of intense selfishness as they struggle to connect. HE is constantly delving into HER unhappy past even though it can give neither of them any pleasure or joy. The more HE delves, the more SHE becomes hopelessly entangled, and the more obsessed HE becomes... until the cold and bitter end.At least in an opera, you get to revel in an outpouring of passion! In this bitter pill, everything is so cold and humorless... well, it really is difficult to understand why people wax enthusiastic over this film so much. There is much here to ADMIRE... but not much to love, in my opinion. Except intellectually, because the film is awash with symbolism and thought-provoking moments. As a viewing experience for the average intellectual, such as myself, however, I felt that once was enough. The time jumping and abstractions and other critically lauded elements of this movie have been done better and more entertainingly by others. Though this is the most emotionally powerful anti-nuclear statement I've ever seen, for which, as someone who had much of his family die in the Hiroshima nuclear blast, I am profoundly grateful.",

When it came to Breathless, 400 Blows, Jules & Jim, Paris Belongs to Us, any of the other films thus far, the discussion was constantly flowing, but for this film, there was nothing. I don't know if that really means that people didn't like it, but it's not a good sign.As for me, well..... I've been trying to come up with my reasons, and I'm not sure if I can be any more eloquent than \"it was boring\". I try never to use that excuse as the main reason to dislike a film, but it was unfortunately true of this film. I was never enthralled or involved with the story or the characters at all; the tale that the girl tells in the middle of the film that takes up a big chunk of it made me feel absolutely nothing at all. I simply didn't care for the characters. I also felt like the Japanese guy was never able to tell his story; I suppose the opening scene showing the tragedy of Hiroshima is kinda his story, but he's definitely not given enough time to express himself. It seems to be to be merely the girl whining for much of the film.I also had a real problem with the abstractness. I have no real problem with abstractness, but I like there to be something physical for it to build off of. There was none of that here. It was just abstract for the sake of being abstract. I don't know if I didn't get it, but I really didn't care to. I did like the opening scene, as I felt it really got its point across well, but the rest of the film just didn't follow from it.This is coming across as a really negative review, and I really didn't mean it that way. It wasn't terrible, just pretty disappointing. The use of flashbacks is pretty innovative, and I liked the way it played with image and sound. But the story was weak bordering on non-existent, the characters totally unlikeable, and the themes utterly impassable.

            "content": "I. IntroductionThis movie has a strong reputation, but I knew very little about this movie before my first viewing. I was only aware that Marguerite Duras, a fine writer, had produced the original screenplay for the movie and that it was considered a literary gem in its own right. The screenplay is one that you can read and enjoy, on its own, even if no movie had ever been made from it (more on this later).Alain Resnais is the director. I draw it to your attention that this is Resnais' first feature film, and apparently foreshadowed the style of much of his later career. What is clear from this film at least, that he is a gifted, sensitive and unyielding artist. The techniques with which he brings this screenplay to life are rigorous and unflinching. There is love behind what he has done here; you can tell he loves this story and he loves these characters.\nII MechanicsThe movie has only two main personalities. The film follows a brief connection between these two people, over the course of approximately 48 hours. It is a very short film, but its a very compacted one; and all its elements are densely fused together --like a diamond or other gemstone. Its aspects are clear, fine, and bright; there is no murkiness or muddle in the ideas of this film. It is not just a rambling 'romance story'. It is literally a movie in which the camera films little more than the memories of two strangers--and the emotional conundrums that expand when their owners meet, and combine. When each faces the growth of a new relationship. The plot is simple; however the emotions are not. Its a complex psychological study and a visual poem.The setting of the film is extremely succinct: only a few locations contain the entire movie. The journey is rather through an emotional terrain-- a journey of these characters' memories. This inner terrain unfolds (as does everything else in the film) through the dialogue of these two individuals to each other.The characters are a beautiful French actress doing a location-shoot in the town of Hiroshima, Japan; and a Japanese man she meets there. She has a striking appearance, with a face that is both young and old at the same time; a body that is slim but wizened. Her aspect is alluring and carefree in some shots, but she wears her hair in a mature, classic, manner--almost severe. She is in Hiroshima for a few days only at most. It is 1959. She is about 34, and married, but has allowed herself to be picked up by a sensitive, intelligent Japanese man in a bar. He is an architect. They are spending the night together; many of the camera's opening shots are of their closely-entwined limbs.Their conversation begins --and becomes--the movie. Its initially a lovers' conversation, as typically happens between a couple lying in bed after sex. They are talking lazily, insouciantly, chuckling with one another over this or that comment, and playing with each other as they rest. Its a very long scene and takes up almost the first third of the film.\nWhat is odd is that the camera doesnt waver--and this is what is intense: the camerawork thrusts you right into this bed and into every expression exchanged between the couple. There is no retreat or pulling-back. There is not a lot of quick cuts between one face and the other either; a few extended shots capture it all. Because the faces are so close to each other (the two figures are almost one) it can be captured in this deft manner.\nIts an incredibly daring, bold, ruthless cinema. Very like Bergman. I emphasize it here because it is the filming of the actors' faces, as close as feasibly possible, that characterizes the entire movie. Their faces are the landscape of the whole film: your eyes range and glide over the woman's face in particular, which becomes vast and sombre as she relates fragments of her past life to the man beside her, under his coaxing. The conversation eventually becomes tormented and agonizing.But you are witness to every muscle tremor, every nerve twitch, you absorb every expression as it flickers across her beautiful, fey complexion. You watch her huge, sad, brown eyes that gaze into space as she talks about herself. Her smiles turn up the corners of her mouth at times, but her face remains wan and stark. She has the ability to display more than one emotion at a time. Excellent casting and astounding performances, particularly from this actress. The work it must have taken to get these close-up shots so precise and correct--the effects are mesmerizing.I will tell you briefly that the rest of the plot is very simple: the woman rises for her day's filming, but her lover, who becomes increasingly absorbed and obsessed with her, follows her. The last third of the movie is set in the bar they met at the night before, where he attempts to convince her to stay in Hiroshima. (At the end of the film, this is still left ambiguous). There is a montage or two, there are flashbacks deployed which help reveal the woman's past up to this trip to Hiroshima.\nIII. MeaningWhat really goes on here? How can a film survive on a construction of only three basic scenes, and two characters? Well, what happens is that with a human theme of this microscopic focus, the addition of anything more than a few basic sets, scenes, or actions is negligible. Duras, rather, is exploring their souls. Exteriorality simply doesnt matter. The nature of the relationship between the pair reduces everything else to ornament, prelude and ephemera to their contact.What develops the tension is the crucially important dialogue the pair have with each other. Because of the complexity of the verbal revelations, it is the dialogue that becomes dominant in this film. Its hard to explain. The two people are merely telling each other stories of how they grew up; they talk about where they were the day that U.S. forces dropped the atomic bomb. The man was a soldier in the Japanese army at the time, she was a young girl in a small town in France. She had been in love with a soldier who died. Again, very simple.But note this: when she speaks to this Japanese man, a wonderful device is used by Duras (and filmed exquisitely by Resnais). She is speaking to the Japanese man but really she is talking to her past lover. So, all is not what it seems. Growth is really destruction, peace is really war, love is really death as seen through the prism of this woman's history--thats why she's in Hiroshima. And it is this 'doubling-over' and multiplicity of character with its symbol that is the heart of this film.\nIt is a dialogue not just between two lovers but between two people and their pasts. There are surfaces under surfaces. All of the elements are in juxtaposition. All of them are mirrored. All of them are in conflict. All of them are in alignment. The movie swirls with rich, intermeshed images, symbols, allusions, and metaphors.For example, when the woman speaks of the river Loire that ran by her home, you see (all at the same time) her face, the river, and from the depths of the river, a hand beckoning (and it is the hand which is the memory she is recalling when she speaks of the river). This is but a minor example of the care that went into crafting every scene in this film. Its absolutely grand. I cant say anymore without giving it all away.Flaws: the one flaw I see in this entire movie is that the dialogue is not always what you would really hear someone speak in real life. The sentences are at times very cumbersome, overly-literate and 'speechy'. It is as if Duras forgot that people dont utter really complex, poetic sentences to each other in real life. The screenplay should have been altered just enough to efface this. At these moments it really would have been better to have been reading the dialogue rather than listening to it; because it just sounds stilted and frail.And there are times when the poetic images and metaphors are repeated and touched upon excessively--the density of the layers becomes a distraction in itself. Sometimes Resnais or Duras advances a motif, not just two or three times but five or six times, redoubling it in only a very few minutes. It would have been better to have a lighter touch in some places. But these are minor complaints.\nIV ConclusionOverall HMA is an enormously sensitive work of filmmaking. The story itself is moving in a way that should have impact and bearing on everyone, because it is all about self-awareness, and understanding how our hearts function--these are experiences that we all share in.TS Eliot once said that \"April is the cruelest month, because it forces new life up out of the cold earth . . \" (my paraphrase). This is a good quote to keep in mind when considering 'Hiroshima Mon Amour'. The Greeks also said something that bears on this film: namely that change is the true nature of the universe. This movie is about self-change. It is about the cruelty inherent in personal growth, in having to shed your bonds with the dead.\nHMA is a story about being alive and being human. It is about the pain of loving or losing one's love and the greater torment at having to relinquish that pain we sometimes wish to nurse and hold on to. These are sometimes the effects that loving someone has on your soul; and I will go out on a limb and say that its never been treated better than in this movie. Perhaps 'Last Year at MarienBad' is a close second.But the emotional signature of 'Hiroshima mon Amour' is wholly unique. The movie is a landmark in cinema.",

            "content": "Despite having won the Criterion DVD on Ebay a few years ago,I have somehow never got round to loading up my first ever \"Left Bank\" title.Taking a look at IMDbs Classic Film board,I spotted an excellent post about the film from a fellow IMDber,which led to me deciding that it was time I finally took a look at the Left Bank.The plot:Going to Hiroshima to star in a film in an anti-War title,French actress Elle finds the production to suffer long delays.As filming continues to be delayed,Elle begins an affair with an architect called Lui.As Elle shares her memories of the \"victory\" of the end of WWII,Lui reveals to Elle that she has no \"real\" memories of the Hiroshima bombing,as he begins to reveal everything that he witnessed in the aftermath of the attack. Gradually developing feelings of love & intimacy towards Lui,Elle begins to face the dark near-forgotten memories hidden in her past. View on the film:Opening with an extraordinary shot featuring the bodies of two people entwined having sex, Alain Resnais and cinematographers Michio Takahashi & Sacha Vierny take any shade of lust or sensuality out of the scene,as Resnais and the cinematographers focus on the side angles of the characters bodies dehumanises them,and gives the lovers the appearance of being part of the decaying nuclear wasteland that Hiroshima is left in.Originally planning to make the movie be a documentary about the Hiroshima bombing, Resnais and editors Jasmine Chasney/ Henri Colpi & Anne Sarraute give the title a horrifying atmosphere by precisely crossing the French New-Wave cool with a documentary grittiness.With clever use archive newsreel footage Resnais looks into the eyes of the victims/survivors of the nuclear attack.Joining the couple at (what might be) the final stage of their relationship,Resnais superbly expresses the feeling of an aching love that they have for each other,by subtly featuring a \"gap\" between the lovers in each of the shots they share.Taking the first step to humanise the entwined couple by splashing a huge grin across Lui's face,the exquisite screenplay by Marguerite Duras gives the exchanges between Lui and Elle an extraordinary feeling of intimacy,thanks to the conversations that the couple have in bed featuring a raw, naturalistic quality. Skilfully going into Elle's past with fragmented flashbacks,Duras gradually builds a delicate psychological depth for Lui & Elle,with the flashbacks opening up the remembrance to the pains of love and death that Lui and Elle have each been unable to approach from their pasts.Despite not knowing any French before filming. (he learnt it during production!) Eiji Okada gives an extraordinary performance as Lui,with Okada perfectly revealing Lui's uncomfortable feelings on Elle's \"memories\" of the Hiroshima attack.Along with opening Lui's wounds,Okada displays Lui's longing for Elle in a poetic manner,with Okada detailed body language making the \"gap\" between Elle & Lui feel like one of not of inches,but miles.Slowly facing her memories of the past,an elegant Emmanuelle Riva gives an excellent performance as Elle,whose first love's loss is buried deep within her eyes by Riva. Introduced in the title laying in bed with Lui,Riva gives Elle a rich,warm chemistry with Lui,as Riva makes each look that Elle shares with Lui make her question the memories of the past and the relationship that she finds herself in,as Lui expresses his amour to Elle.",

            "content": "Often considered to be one of the best movies of the French New Wave, Hiroshima Mon Amour has a strange and foreboding atmosphere to it while simultaneously being rather tame by modern film standards. While there's quite a number of sexual scenes in it, it can almost be considered a world war 2 movie because of its title and the backstories of the main characters. The movie starts with a rather long prologue which is narrated by a female voice. In it, we are shown the horrible destruction caused by the first atom bomb that was dropped on japan toward the end of world war 2. Eventually, the prologue ends and the source of the female voice is revealed; a woman played by Emmanuelle Riva. She has no actual name. She's currently in a relationship with a man played by Eiji Okada (who has no name either). Both of them are living in Hiroshima, and it's been over a decade since the war left it a pile of rubble. The female main character is shown to have a great disdain for armed conflict, and goes to work on the set of an anti-war movie. Even though it's revealed her and her lover haven't been together for very long, it is already almost time for them to go their own ways. When night comes, both of them go to a restaurant and tell each other about their past selves. As it turns out, both of them were rather directly involved in world war 2. The girl was raised in the french town of Nevers, a small settlement that was overtaken by the germans when they invaded the country in 1940. Eventually, she found herself wanting to marry a wehrmacht soldier, but he was killed by the americans when the town was liberated. People eventually found out about her relationship with this enemy combatant and punished her by sealing her in her parent's basement for days on end. The man on the other hand explains how he had a much more personal role in the war, and was drafted into the IJA and was away from his home town of Hiroshima the day it got nuked. After the war, both of these characters moved to the city. The man asks the girl one last time if she wants to stay in japan, but she declines as he is already married. While preparing to go back to france, the girl dejectedly heads back to her hotel room, and gets mad when she finds out the man has followed her. She wants to forget about her time with him now that she has to leave, and tells him she's already forgetting his identity. It's then revealed that the nameless characters have the same names as their cities of origin, with the girl being called Nevers and the man being named Hiroshima. Because this movie was a cooperative effort between france and japan, it shows scenery from both nations, although it isn't immediately obvious. While many people consider this film to be amazing, I'll be the first to say that I did not understand the ending. I suppose it means that because the girl represents a french city and her lover represents a japanese one, it's saying how ww2 is over and any hostilities between people from countries that opposed each other during the war should be forgiven. I say this because france was on the allied side during the war (before it was invaded) and japan was on the opposite side, fighting with the nazis. Japanese and french troops never fought each other during the war, but the characters in the movie still might have some resentment towards each other based on their respective country's pasts. Ultimately, the girl has to leave her boyfriend because she already tried having a relationship during the war and it didn't go anywhere. Probably the best thing this film has going for it is its substantial use of ambience. Especially towards the end, there's a lot of scenes that have little talking in them and just choose to display odd camera angles and far away shots of buildings. Apart from these things (and the love story), there isn't really much to this movie. I thought it was passable because of its connections to world war 2 as well as the use of shadows and lighting, but most people today will probably find it pretty slow moving. The majority of old movies are like that, so it can arguably be a benefit.",

            "content": "The comparison between heart break and the Hiroshima bombing is beautiful. The film is about the pain of memories forgotten and remembered. Just as the pain of lost love will be forgotten so too have the horrors of Hiroshima. The scars will always be there but that feeling of pain and isolation as the world celebrates while you mourn will be lost in the past. Lui is helping to rebuild Hiroshima as an architect and Elle has fled Nevers, the place of her love affair with a German soldier. The film represents Frech New Wave in it's reaction against the Hollywood style. The plot is reminiscent of Brief Encounter and Casablanca (they even go to a bar called Casablanca at one point) but the films style is vastly different. Action will jump in time while conversation remains the same, the story jumps around chronologically and we are often unsure of where precisely in time we are. The reason it sets itself apart from other new ave films is it's use of style. Jump cuts and screwing with the chronology are not used because they can be but for a purpose. The chronology is off because the scenes are memories acting like real memories and flowing randomly. The cuts help accentuate how little time these two lovers have with each other before they will be parted. An excellent film well-deserved of it's excellent reputation.",

After the infamous close-ups of the couple entwined, as flesh and as stone, we switch, seemingly, to a documentary style telling of Hiroshima and the bomb. But though this happens Resnais' film is about the couple and in particular her past years and love, that was lost. This doomed relationship hangs on because the Japanese architect she has met seems to realise that the only way he can 'hold on' to this fleeting love, is for her to reveal herself. And she does even to her own surprise. as the beautifully shot film unfold we discover more, as do the two lovers, and we seem a party to this fragile thing with the horrors of the war echoing in the background.

            "content": "As a follow up to his monumental documentary \"Nuit et brouillard\" (Night and Fog), Resnais continues in his war motif with a chilling and powerful statement on the post-modernist, post-war world.  An incarnation of a Marguerite Duras screen-play, \"Hiroshima mon amour\" depicts the confusion surrounding an eracinated and war-stricken people.Questioning the possibility of Mimesis--\"Tu n'as rien vu \u00e0 Hiroshima. Rien!\" (You saw nothing in Hiroshima. Nothing!)-- Resnais rejects the notion of re-creation or imitation, conforming to the philosophies of Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida and thus calling into question his own efforts in \"Nuit et brouillard.\"  At the same time, he adheres to the Aristotelian ideal that the purpose of Mimesis is the cathartic effect produced by pity and terror, and not merely the representation.Appealing also to Freudian psychoanalysis, the characters are forced to re-examine the effects of the pathology in attempt to reconstruct the past and determine the cause.  (Notice Resnais' use of lighting in the reconstruction scene.)  Subtle clues throughout enable the viewer to piece together the story and perform their own psychoanalysis of the situation. A young woman from Nevers, France vows to \"never\" return to her hometown and the viewer is left to determine the cause.In my opinion, one of the top ten films of all time, \"Hiroshima mon amour\" is a work of art that all lovers of cinema must see.  Resnais is a cinematographic genius, and his ambivalent depiction of post-war Japan and France in the characters of \"Him\" and \"Her\" make this film a cultural landmark as well as masterpiece of post-war, post-modernist art.",

It has become a feature film with one of the strangest opening scenes I have ever seen. We see a couple making love in extreme close up alternated with documentary footage of the devastations wrought by the atomic bomb. The body's of the couple are being sprinkled with sand, without doubt symbolizing nuclear fallout. On top of that there is a conversation in which the woman claims she knows everything about the bomb because she has visited the museum and participated in the guided tour and the man responds that she knows nothing. This conversation highlights the difference between objective- and subjective (or experiential) knowledge, but the question is when did it take place? It probably isn't their bedtime (love making) conversation, isn't it?The loving couple is a French woman (Elle / She, played by Emmanuelle Riva) and a Japanese man (Lui / Him, played by Eiji Okada). Both have suffered from the Second World War. His family was killed by the bomb when he was somewhere else as a soldier. She had a love affair with a German soldier who later got killed and was punished and humiliated after the war.The love affair with Lui wakes up memory's in Elle about her earlier love affair. As spectator we only become fully aware of this only later in the film. The flashbacks about what happened in France are in long shots and with a static camera, the present in Japan are mainly medium shots and close ups with a moving camera. I think the director wanted to show that the past has been frozen in the memory of the woman while the present has not taken his definite shape yet.\"Hiroshima mon amour\" is a well thought out film. It is a film about dialogue and not about action. The dialogue is philosophical and, I have to say it, a little artificial. The two main (or only) characters in essence discuss with each other the reliability of memory and the possibility of real communication. Can a European really understand what has been going on in Asia and vice versa?I have seen other films with no action and only dialogue (\"Locke\", 2013, Steven Knight) and also other films revolving around a philosophical theme (\"Rashomon\", 1950, Akira Kurosawa). In the first mentioned the dialogues definitely were more natural and in \"Rashomon\" the philosophical question (if \"the objective truth\" really exists) was asked with more clarity.",

After a few months of reviewing existing Japanese documentaries on the subject (such as the work of Hideo Sekigawa: \"Hiroshima\" and \"Children of Hiroshima\"), Resnais quit the project, saying that a new documentary couldn't add anything to what has already been said and shown. That's when the producers floated the idea of hiring a screenwriter and turning the documentary into a feature length drama. Resnais accepted, and the result is far better than the sum of documentary + drama. \"Hiroshima mon amour\" is a powerful film on the subject of tragedy, the persistence of memory, and the hope--if there is any--of recovering from something so horrible that your mind does everything in its power to block it out.The story follows 2 lovers, a nameless French woman and a nameless Japanese man, over the course of 24 hours. We open on them parting on the morning after their casual but passionate affair, and the film takes us through the day, evening and night to the following morning as they each wrestle with the inability to say goodbye because they realize they are hopelessly bound together by the same haunting demons. The man was a Japanese soldier who had returned to find his home incinerated, while the woman has her own wartime trauma to reckon with, something she refuses to confront at first but slowly reveals piece by piece to this strange man who is oddly the most kindred soul she has met in the 14 years since the war.Although there's no real \"action\" here, the storytelling is suspenseful and gripping as the woman's story foams to the surface, and the man becomes a surrogate for the voice of her past, gently leading her deeper into her own suppressed memories with an almost hypnotic tone. It should be noted that the man (Eiji Okada whom you might recognize from the Brando flick \"The Ugly American\" or the Teshigahara masterpiece \"Woman in the Dunes\") didn't speak a word of French before filming, so his dialogue is wonderfully slow, careful and childlike. It reminded me of Ron Perlman's charming monosyllabic French in \"City of Lost Children\".The woman is fantastically played by Emmanuelle Riva in her first (of many) starring roles. Her slowly evolving performance gives us one of the most realistic, most intimate portraits of a person who is repressing a painful secret, on the surface completely normal and happy-go-lucky but, as we soon realize, deeply tormented and empty inside.Relating all of this back to the original intent of this \"atom bomb documentary\", it gives us a subject far more deeply personal than any historical recounting of facts and images. If we're paying attention, we realize that this nameless French woman's story is the story of every victim of war. More than that, it's the story of the human race struggling to recover from its own foolish penchant for self-destruction.",

It was an incredibly powerful experience, and had I seen it in the theater I would have simply sat there until the next showing and watched it again. But instead I never saw it again, until now. I always ranked it among my four favorite films (along with The Third Man, Citizen Kane and Rashomon), but unlike my other favorites, this one never turns up on TV, and somehow I never wound up going to see it in the theater.I was worried that it wouldn't hold up to my memory, but it was just as powerful as I remember. Visually stunning and beautifully directed, with one of the most poetic screenplays of any film, the movie is an incredible emotional and intellectual experience.Like most French films, Hiroshima Mon Amour is basically people sitting around talking about their feelings for an hour and a half, the very thing that I hate most French films for. But while Godard puts me to sleep, Resnais, France's greatest, most original director, illustrates these conversations with a constantly moving camera that creates new levels to every word. And Duras has written a conversation like no other, an exploration of memory that is romantic and tragic, sad and somewhat insane.The power of the movie can't really be explained, at least not by me. There are incredible moments, both of human emotion and of cinematic brilliance (there is one moment in the film that speaks of memory in such a brilliant, surprising way that it stands to this day as my single favorite cinematic moment).Already, I feel like watching it over again.",

            "content": "I have avoided seeing this for several decades, mainly because I had been afraid to see it. The very word \"Hiroshima\" calls to my mind the horrific events of August 6, 1945. Having once seen scenes of the aftermath of the bombing on the civilian population, one is not anxious to revisit those. My reaction resonates perfectly with the two main themes of this movie: the inability to forget, and how important life events can easily slip into the fog of memory. Two phrases from the movie underline this duality, \"memory, I banish you,\" and \"the horror of forgetting.\" It *is* a horror to forget what happened to Hiroshima at the end of WWII. One would think that that memory would prevent anyone but the most insane politician from even contemplating the use of a nuclear weapon, but it's astonishing that the standoff between Kruschev and Kennedy brought us to the edge of nuclear war in 1962. Only seventeen years after Hiroshima the memory had faded to where it was not unthinkable to unleash a more potent hell.The city of Hiroshima provides the central backdrop. At the time this was filmed we see that the city has risen from the ashes in the fourteen years since its destruction. There are some stomach turning images shown from exhibits in the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and seen during a peace parade, but this movie is not a documentary about the bombing, but rather a story overlaid on that background. The two main characters are a man and a woman who remain nameless throughout the movie. The woman (Emmanuelle Riva) is a French film star who has come to Hiroshima to make a peace movie. While there she meets a Japanese man (Eiji Okada) and they engage in a brief, passionate affair. Obviously the man has been wounded by the war, but the war has left the woman with painful memories as well--memories of pleasure that cause pain.The presentation is abstract and symbolic rather than realistic. For example, there is a scene that has the man and woman walking along the street at a slow pace where the man gradually falls behind and ultimately fades into the background. This scene is effective due to its deliberate pacing and emotional restraint rather than its realism. However, the arty production does not prevent the story from being accessible. The black and white filming is appropriate for the subject matter and is also a good choice since there are so many close-ups. I never know who should get credit for impressive cinematography, but acknowledgment should be given for that here.Both the leads turn in noteworthy performances. Riva is good at expressing her painful remembrances and Okada is more reserved, but no less passionate.I am glad to have finally seen this. I can now scratch it off of my \"should see\" list.",

            "review_title": "Deep, beautiful, devastating, extremely personal cinema",
            "content": "In my previous paper I said that \u00c0 bout de souffle was an extremely complicated movie. Well, if we compare it to Resnais' Hiroshima, mon amour, it just seems to be a skilled aesthetic exercise. I think Resnais takes a further step in modern cinema intermingling influences from surrealism, modernism and the New Wave of French cinema: intimate topics, deep and changing characters, oneirism, unclear limits between reality and mind. His movie is a skilled masterpiece that really needs to be seen twice since its symbolism and action are extremely interwoven. Personally, I felt somewhat frustrated the first time I saw it. Indeed, I find that Resnais style in this film is too extreme in some ways. He twists action and mixes reality with memories in a way that makes the spectator lose his/her way once and again. On top of that, most usually action is extremely slow -quite the contrary of his colleague Godard- and takes are extremely long. Truffaut did shoot this kind of scenes, but his were also agile, attractive. Resnais is slow, exasperating, boring. We must think however that Hiroshima mon amour is a literary film, a long shot poem. The script is a literary work of art by Marguerite Duras. Indeed, dialogs are like lines in a poem, rhythmically broken, slow, as if they were declaimed instead of simply said. Resnais complements this poetry inserting strongly lyric scenes of the Japanese people and the city of Hiroshima and playing around with meaningful light, as we will see later. In my opinion, the main topic of this film is memories and how a forgotten dark past can shape our present and determine our future. Basically, the film tells the story of a woman who has gone through a painful experience in his youth: she loved a German soldier during the occupation of Nevers, her hometown in France. This caused despise from her family and her community. This is a story that she has not told ever before. But an affair with a Japanese man while she shoots a film in Hiroshima will wake up her memories. The Japanese man recalls her of her first love; let us remember for instance, when she remembers the German man hand when she sees the Japanese's  -both of them have a similar hair style and color. At some point in the film, the Japanese will grow more interested in her life in Nevers -he thinks the key to win her love is there- and this will unleash harsh flashbacks in the French woman's memories. She has never told anyone: as she talks out, articulates her memories -while they are at the bar- she will experience very strong feelings. We cannot differentiate what she was feeling at the moment of the story or what she is feeling now, what is a fact and what is a memory. I find very interesting the scene in which they sit together at the bar: at some point she takes the Japanese man for her old love. She begins talking to him as if he was so. Her memories take her over and she talks what she feels, what she remembers. Light effects are magical: she is drowned in brightness while the Japanese man stays in the dark. She talks and talks and Resnais inserts the necessary flashback images. The Japanese at that moment acts as the voice of her own memory: he asks her once and again. Until a point when she suffers so dramatically that the Japanese man, the real one, slaps her in her face to wake her up. Now we find a sharp kind of awakening. While she talked everything was silent. Now, everything sound as what it is: a bar with people chattering and frogs in the dark stream outside. There are four main elements in the film that spin around the life of the French girl, whose name we do not know. Two cities: Nevers and Hiroshima. And two men: the German soldier and the Japanese man. There is a whole system of connections between these four elements in the center of which is her. Resnais uses the powerful image of Hiroshima, the sadness of the place and grief of the people to identify the sadness and grief of the Frecn girl at Nevers. On the other side, the Japanese man reminds her of the German soldier. There is not an exact parallelism between the two cities or the two men, but connections can be made. We must remember the images of the streets in Hiroshima and the images of Nevers -la Place de la R\u00e9publique, the churches-, flowing at the same time. The beautiful but empty Loire, the dead fields of Hiroshima. Although we can see some parallelism between the two cities, Resnais ends up the film with a scene in which this relationship seems to be much stronger. 'Toi, ton nom est Hiroshima. - Et toi, ton nom est Nevers, en France'. However, I cannot figure out what is the exact relationship between the two cities: maybe a comparison between grief in the memory and actual grief in the present day. Whatever way it might be, Resnais leaves for us a cryptic, dark ending that we would have to figure out the best we can depending on the elements he has given us in the film.",

The dialogues between her and Okada are about things we've all thought and felt every now and then. It takes place in Hiroshima fifteen years after the bomb and I find it brilliant how the movie talks about the global tragedy that was the dropping of an atomic bomb and the personal tragedy that is to lose and try not to forget the man you loved. As it is the script what struck me the most, I personally don't think this is as much as a Resnais' film as it is Duras'. Almost 60 years already. Everyone with a major role in the movie is gone.

Elle, a French actress making an anti war film in Hiroshima (Emmanuelle Riva) and Lui, an architect (Eiji Okada) embark upon an affair whilst grappling with the horror of the past. At first the film confronts, it seems self critical but as it goes moves beyond the universal to the personal. At first we see the two, naked bodies entwined amidst falling sand (that of time), then the sand is cut off. Elle talks of Hiroshima, of the bomb and its effects, of a commemorative museum as Lui contradicts at every turn. And later we see something of Elle's film, slogans, horror reduced to image on paper held aloft. The question lingers, from such horror as the atomic bomb can, or should any art be made, is such a thing even with the noblest of points more than just exploitation? Its a difficult arena and one could argue shaky morality in the fundamentals of this film, but ultimately it isn't a film about morality but people and as a psychological work it is very fine. Much focus is made upon the faces of the two leads, this is very much an interior film, driven by their performances. Both are exceptional, Riva moving between deep love and sorrow, playful happiness and sudden trouble, openness and denial, while Okada is more teasing, open and warm, sometimes vexed or confused, always coaxing. For her the past is alive, her sorrows as a teen in love and mistreatment at the hands of her elders draws her to romance parallelled, her new love a reflection of her old passion for a German soldier. But for him the past is something annihilated, for him no country at all, but something to be lived with her, his ashes rekindled in her memory. As the two move through their romance the two conflict in their relationship with the past and emotions are stripped, sad but ultimately hopeful as the two come to recognise and embody their pasts, with future unknown. And they embody place as well, Elle a symbol of rural France, its romance, tradition and punishment and Lui symbolic of city, and more so city in rebirth, in hope, with their relationship saying something for the connection of old and new, not just on a personal or psychological level but universal. Its potent, heartwarming stuff and as moving for me as just about any film that has required me to really think. 9/10 from me, highly recommended.",

            "content": "Hiroshima Mon Amour has been a highly influential film, even as it was clearly influenced by the films of Orson Welles, and even some B sci fi films. It uses repetitive dialogue, recurring motifs, and visual repetons throughout, and is quite Bergman-like in that dialogue, its close-ups, and the way characters look away from each other. But, many critics, naturally, have taken the lazy way out in their criticism, usually falling back upon the oft repeated claims from the Cahiers crowd that the film follows the pattern of a symphony, or is a\u0085.you guessed it: a tone poem, without even knowing what the term means. But the film is far less a piece of visual music than it is a visual piece of skaldic poetry, wherein the scenes act as stanzas that have refrains of past moments, and where much of the symbolism acts as kenning does in skaldic poetry- using familiar words in new ways as a substitute for familiar images. This technical aspect of the film is among its strongest points, whereas the film is at its weakest in its portrayal of the characters and the brief relationship. Instead of naturalistic dialogue, wherein depths are revealed via the accidental poesy of banalities arranged in interesting ways, the characters speak almost directly in symbolic and self-conscious ways. They leave the subtext of the film's art nakedly exposed, and this artifice acts against an emotional connection to the characters. In the later, and more daring, Last Year In Marienbad, this is not a problem because the action seems to take place in a hermetic, unreal place. This is not so in Hiroshima Mon Amour. Hence, the symbolic nature of the characters stands in far greater contrast to their mis-en-scene then they do in the later film. Also, the constant repetition of themes, hammering- rather than deftly applying them, also detracts from the film, making its worst moments feel not only didactic, but pedantic. But, overall, these- and the overreach of the female characterization- are minor flaws, and serve only to keep the film from unadulterated greatness. But, no one ever claimed near-greatness was bad. Many bad critics, however, have claimed the film has no real narrative, but, as with similar claims for 2001: A Space Odyssey, these critics mistake a different sort of narrative for its lack.Hiroshima Mon Amour is an excellent film (miles above its two New Wave counterparts from the same year of release- Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut's The 400 Blows and Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless), as a work of the cinematic arts, and as a chart of the human psyche's difficulties in dealing with memory. Many have claimed the film is, indeed, about memory, but it's not. The woman, and, to a lesser extent, the man, have no problems with their memories. They do, however, seem to have reluctance (on his part) and dread (on her part) in dealing with certain memories they possess, and this is no mere semantic difference, but key to understanding the film's portrayal of its characters, especially in context with the larger context of the bombing of Hiroshima hovering about, within, and without, the film. No, it does not do this flawlessly, but it does do so well enough to be heartily recommended, for it is a film, whether you emotionally like or dislike it, you will intellectually be glad to have seen and experienced.

As the movie unfolds, it becomes more challenging and less accessible, also more difficult to take in on a purely aesthetic and emotional level, though it finally has the power to truly engage you intellectually, as a complex character study in a novel would. It is an emotional movie despite being so very unemotionally executed \u0096 a Resnais trademark, from what I can see.It's a funny coincidence that in the last six months or so, I've seen quite a few movies featuring women having their heads shaved just after WWII as punishment for having had affairs with German soldiers. This was the most challenging of the batch, bringing home the full sense of the \"horror of oblivion\", as the \"Lui\" character comments on \"Elle\"'s condition at one point. Hiroshima Mon Amour also reminded me of Antonioni a little, rather than the other Resnais movie that I'd seen which was also about memory: Muriel ou Le temps d'un retour. Hiroshima evokes Antonioni in a paradoxical way, since it was thematically the opposite of the Italians' movies. In Hiroshima, a man and a woman were doing the opposite of being alienated from one another, though also in a desolate emotional land/cityscape that could be superficially called Antonionian.Regarding people calling it Nouvelle Vague, in my view this is a one of a kind movie and no more New Wave than Notti di Cabiria is Neo-realist. It is also quite obviously a literary movie \u0096 halfway between cinema and literature in nature, and very unique for it.

As forgetting means the threat to eradicate everything that once constituted individual or collective meaning of life, to let a dream that transcended sorrows, the hope, elation and joy sink back into oblivion, to make the past and thus existence built on it irrelevant. Director Alain Resnais and writer Marguerite Duras set out on a remarkable poetic journey to express these mentioned thoughts and hauntingly succeeded. The viewer becomes witness of the portrayal of intimate insights in the soul of a French actress who has a brief affair with a Japanese, but the sincere love combined with the horror of the historic place the couple finds itself in is reason enough to awaken an own personal story of innocence that once resulted in tragedy. The Japanese city of Hiroshima and the French Nevers become symbols of lives where history casts a long shadow and drowns the light. Unless one finds a way to penetrate the darkness, and in this rare case two people do.\"Hiroshima, mon Amour\" is a true piece of art with an emphasis on Duras' literary approach on the subject matter, enhanced by Resnais Nouvelle Vague inspired cinematography and editing techniques. The film conveys a deeply melancholic tone through images, camera movements, restrained music and monotone talk. Resnais adds quick cuts and cross cuts to capture how thoughts and emotions travel from one city to another, from present to past, from trauma to what preceded it, circling again and again around the protagonist's hidden secret in order to unearth it, share it, finally give it back its importance. In the end it is all about Hiroshima, who helps to remember Nevers, and Nevers to remember Hiroshima. \"Hiroshima, mon Amour\" is probably not a film to instantly grab you, but it is a lasting one.

Yes, some of the imagery of or reflections on the destruction of Hiroshima are tragic and disturbing, but difficult content is a different matter. No, what makes this so challenging is the emphatically sideways and underhanded approach to its storytelling, and the presentation of its themes. There's the active narrative of the time that the man and woman spend together - and then there are the fragmented, indistinct discussions of past events, that even with depicted flashbacks become clear only very piecemeal, and with very deliberate, irregular pacing. At all times the writing takes the longest and most winding road to weave its tale of fleeting romance and recollection, all but proverbially doubling back and glancing behind to ensure that no one is following it except by the beacons that it lays down itself. Characters, story threads, dialogue, and any bigger or more overarching ideas are treated like a book that only this film can read, with pages that only this film can turn, as it pleases. And for all that, still I'm not entirely sure how coherent or complete it is, or therefore how meaningfully cohesive and cohesively meaningful it is. 'Hiroshima mon amour' is a picture that will be right up the alley of anyone who likes art films. If it's a straightforward drama you're anticipating or otherwise seeking, maybe you should keep looking.Chief stars Emmanuelle Riva and Eiji Okada are fantastic. Alain Resnais' direction, and the cinematography of Sacha Vierny and Michio Takahashi, are lovely. I admire the sheer daring of Renais, and screenwriter Marguerite Duras, to make a feature that goes against almost all convention of (cinematic) storytelling. I wonder, however, if the end result doesn't lean too hard into that thrust, clouding if not outright losing sight of the actual storytelling in the process. As if to accentuate the point, He is little more than a sounding board for Her, and perhaps it speaks to my expectations more than anything else, but the feature seems imbalanced as it becomes almost exclusively all about Her without any palpable development of His character. I wonder if this marked an intentional effort to turn away any viewers who couldn't engage with the title at its most abstruse level, or if there was just no thought put toward viewership at all. Obviously 'Hiroshima mon amour' has enjoyed high acclaim since its release, and I can understand why; the artistic bent here is undeniable, and there are plentiful juicy notions herein. The question is one of weighing the value of the feature's content, and the pure fancifulness with which it's laid before us, against the challenge (and subjective vexation) of that obfuscation. It's a question of personal preference, and while I like this, and its convoluted exploration of love, impermanence, constancy, memory, and so on - well, I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't have preferred a film that didn't try so hard to reach for lofty pretensions. Sometimes less is more, and I feel like Resnais and Duras could have practiced a tinge more self-restraint, opening the movie to wider audiences, without truly impacting the integrity of their vision.I'll watch almost anything, no matter the genre or expected quality; some titles I love, others I hate, others I'm just indifferent to. I suppose 'Hiroshima mon amour' is a title I altogether don't \"get.\" I don't think there's any shame in that; I'm glad for those who appreciate it still more, and derive more satisfaction and fulfillment from it. I want to like this more than I do; maybe a second viewing would reveal something to me that I've missed out on the first time. I think it's worth checking out - with the caveat that one rather needs to be especially attuned to the same very particular wavelength to really draw the most from it. Take a look, by all means, but just first consider what exactly it is you want out of your movie experiences.",

            "content": "Hiroshima MON AMOUR is a romantic drama about lost love, war, wishes and concerns. A French actress has came to Hiroshima to shoot a film about peace. She begins an affair with an architect. One passionate night has revived their war trauma from the past... The protagonists, which are lost in their strong emotions, are nameless. Confusing repetition of words and desires have connected two souls. They are investigating wartime past and her first love. The pace is rather slow. Unclear story was interrupted by sudden flashbacks. Scenery is a sort of contrast between the destroyed and reconstructed city. Death, disease, suffering and pain were replaced by love and memories. A love, that has trapped in the past, has escaped to the surface. A short and intense romance was compared with a strong wartime love. The protagonists were torn with an internal conflict between loyalty and indecision. Emmanuelle Riva as Elle (She)is a pale, gentle and concerned woman. Her world has collapsed in her war youth. She attempts, through a brief romance, to revive her severe war past. Eiji Okada as Lui (He)is confused lover, who has tried to understand the new situation. He is a man who feels love around him while it slowly escapes from him.Stay? Leave? Try? Lots of questions. There is no answer. However, Mr. Resnais has, trough a common contrasts, flashbacks and non-linear narrative structure, made a very good movie.",

            "content": "I never fell asleep in a movie until we started studying the French New Wave cinema in my international film and television class, but this was a monstrosity. Alain Resnais has made some incredible films. Most notably the holocaust documentary Night and Fog. This is not up to par.I never thought I would see a film that ran out of story when its only ninety minutes long. The opening sequence was beautifully shot but it just seemed to go on and on and wouldn't stop, not to mention it was irrelevant to the story. This film had two messages. One is, those damned American's going around bombing people. The other is a love story between a french woman with a dark past and a Japanese man.This movie looses ground in several ways. One is the use of excessive voice over. Voice overs are okay if they are essential in letting people know the back story and you are unable to do that any other way. But these voice overs account for a large percentage of the film. They never stopped, they just kept going, and going , and going, and going, and going, and going. You get the idea.Well, eventually the story takes us to yet another endless sequence of the couple eating dinner at a restaurant and the woman complaining about her life to a man who lost his family in the war, his story we here very little about. And, like most older french films the women gets a little riled up, the guy slaps her and back hands her, she smiles \"thanks for snapping me out of it\" and keeps on going. Of all of the french films I've seen this semester Jean-Luc Goddard's film \"Contempt\" is the only one that had a slap actually mean something and actually appear to cause some physical pain.Believe it or not the story just dwindled from there. It goes into yet another voice over about Hiroshima's cruel fate and this is followed by a half an hour of the same scene repeated over and over and over and over and over again in different locations. The woman enters a location, the man follows her, he asks her to stay, she refuses and leaves; she enters another location, the man follows her, he asks her to stay, she refuses and leaves; she enters another location, the man follows her and asks her to stay, she refuses and leaves. Bored yet? I guarantee you they repeated that scene more than three times too.Bottom line, just because its french and its old doesn't make it great art. Quality storytelling is essential in the making of any film and that is something that Hirshima Mon Amour does not offer.",

            "content": "Alain Resnais was part of the 'Left Bank' of the French New Wave, alongside with Jacques Demy, Agnes Varda and Chris Marker, which was a group much more politically aware, and associated with modernism, compared to the film fanatics of Cahiers du Cinema (Rivette, Rohmer, Truffaut, Chabrol and Godard). The first films the new wave filmmakers made often remained as their most famous ones - Godard's Breathless (1960) and Truffaut's The 400 Blows (1959) for instance. Hiroshima mon amour was Resnais' first feature and is still his most famous one among Last Year in Marienbad and Muriel. Before his feature debut Resnais made a lot of documentaries of which the most famous ones were the masterful Statues Also Die (1955) and Night and Fog (1955). Hiroshima mon amour is one of the key films of the new wave and compared to The 400 Blows and Breathless it is far more complex, in both style and content.Hiroshima mon amour is a story about a man and a woman who both try to forget and, paradoxically, to remember. The woman has traveled to Hiroshima because she acts in an international films about peace. When she meets the man she is immediately reminded of her past that won't let go - of a German man she once loved.The theme of time can be seen as a leading theme throughout Resnais' work. He has always dealt with history and the lasting impact of it but in his films the moment of meeting is the only existing time. Resnais has infiltrated to the layers of memory, yearning and death exhaling from man. When Hiroshima mon amour was released everyone was talking about the French new wave - filmmakers tried new things, combined fiction and reality, searched for new dimensions of cinema and tested the limitations of it. It was first 'supposed' to be a film about atom bomb but Hiroshima mon amour, together with the writer Marquerite Duras, grew out to be a film about the everlasting pain, past and memory.Hiroshima mon amour is also a film about the difficulty of understanding and the contradiction between remembrance and insult. I myself have visited Birkenau, Auschwitz a few years ago. I went to the concentration camp with my family we saw the ruins of it and the reconstructions in the museum. We took pictures there of us walking on the railroads and leaning on the fences. We, people in general, are aware of the horrors and cry over it but still we can take photos there and 'insult' the people who went through it. In the course of time big events, of which we haven't been personally a part of, slowly sink into oblivion. But then, we should remember it, we shouldn't let it sink into oblivion, it should be a part of the upbringing of us all and sometimes this means insulting others.The woman has went to the hospitals of Hiroshima. She has seen the reconstructions and read the writings written by eyewitnesses. She has cried over Hiroshima and seen the horrors. But the man says \"You haven't seen anything.\" The woman insults the man by infiltrating to his tragedy which he has lived concretely - even that he wasn't physically there. He lives in the city and feels it every day. The woman hasn't given birth to a disfigured child, her parents didn't die in the bombings and she didn't lose all of her friends. She has only experienced Hiroshima in the eyes of a tourist. But she can never understand, feel or see it.The woman infiltrated to the man's tragedy but the man infiltrated to her past. He wants to know about the horrors of Nevers because he wants to know more about the woman. At first, he loves the word Nevers and calls it beautiful - through which he insults the woman just as she did by claiming that she understood Hiroshima. The woman can't live in Nevers, as the man can in Hiroshima, but that doesn't mean that the tragedy wouldn't be just as concrete and paralyzing. The woman hasn't come in terms with her past, she has tried to forget it, and one who isn't in terms with one's past can't understand the presence.When the man gets to know the woman a little better he sees that the horrors she has gone through resemble the pain his nation has gone through. \"Only after Nevers I've begun to know you.\" He asks \"Does it rain over there (Nevers)?\" because rain equals humane pain for him - the acid rain. He tries to understand the woman by comparing his tragedy with hers. He tries to find a similarity between Hiroshima and Nevers, and in addition Alain Resnais has used visual similarities; the two rivers, the dead skin on the people in Hiroshima and the bleeding hands in Nevers, the shaved head of the woman and the women in Hiroshima who have lost their hair.Hiroshima mon amour is a beautiful film about memories, past and oblivion. It's a complex yet quality film in style, content and themes. The philosophy of film comes close to post modernism since the film happens in two different times, and the innovative use of flashbacks was very influential. Hiroshima mon amour is a film about understanding, remembrance and forgetfulness. To remember and to forget; Resnais has clearly marked a difference between private and public memories. \"I thought that man never forgets - not even in love.\"",

            "content": "There are a few sources that I've read on the Internet that herald Hiroshima Mon Amour as the first film of the French New Wave movement of the late 1950s, early 60s. This raises a few interesting points and, if truth be told, I wasn't getting that vibe that so many others seem to be so sure of in regards to the film in question being of the French New Wave variety. I think the sense of that low budget feel is there but this is essentially a romance film, a genre picture if you like. It is a film looking at two people in a relationship but, crucially, taking the time to acknowledge the world around them and how certain events brought them to have this relationship in the first place. It is additionally interesting to note that while it has been known for the French New Wave to take a surrealist look at the youth of the day, Hiroshima Mon Amour likes awfully the notion of looking back into decades gone by at what was and how that contributes to today's world.That isn't to say Hiroshima Mon Amour is a bad film, it's just Bob le flambeur, for me, is the beginnings of said movement. Hiroshima Mon Amour is more a study of events and people by the people that we study in this film. It is a reconciliation of times gone by and a statement that these things will, hopefully, refrain from happening again. It begins with two people making love or engaging in the act of reproduction as images of the horrific results of the Hiroshima Atomic Bomb blast are inter-cut in a sort of odd, juxtaposed series of images displaying acts that introduce life into the world and the results of certain other acts that propel massive amounts of death.The two in question are Elle (Riva), French for 'She' or 'Her', who's an actress in Hiroshima and Lui (Okada), a Japanese architect who's actually from Hiroshima. A lot of the film is musings by these two people; on life, the global situation, their relationship and their pasts. The film is very concentrated in its study of these two people in this particular city, having this particular relationship and whatever politics it wants to get across it introduces with Elle wanting to quite clearly recognise the Hiroshima disaster and Lui initially just discarding it, something quite surprising for someone Japanese to do; then again, maybe he was just more interested in her than his opinion of his semi-destroyed town given the timing of when the conversation was raised.What is born out of this opening, which continues combines documentary style footage inter-cut with said people, is a further scene that really points out its political stance and that's a demonstration about the weapon of mass destruction. So you, as do we all when watching, get the picture that the H-bomb was wrong in this filmmaker's opinion which is fine \u2013 that's done, what's next? Fortunatley, the film does open up further and didn't become what I was fearing: a dreary and fictionalised account that slips in and out of the documentary thus demanding some sort of artistic labelling just because it 'looks' like an avant-garde piece.The conversation that I think saves the piece occurs between the two leads as they talk of past activity. Lui points out that he's from Hiroshima and, had he not been fighting in the Japanese army during the war, he surely would've been killed by 'the bomb' had he still been at home. Additionally, had the bomb never have fallen, Elle would not be there working as an actress and consequently, she would never had met Lui. It's a brief but quite an unnervingly optimistic turnaround given all the 'anti' politics the film had given us prior to this. It's a look at hope; something positive born out of something the author clearly stated previously he thought was negative.But this is it, and I say that with as much positivity as possible. It is a lot of fancy switching from real life footage to two people rolling around in bed. It is a film that wants to say more about the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima than anything else, despite desperately trying to force its way into a genre towards the end when Elle reveals a 'past tragedy' in the sense she loved a German soldier in France during the occupation and suffered at the hands of others when word got out and the war ended. All of that feels included for sake of a runtime, something I didn't expect I'd be coming away from \"the film that started the French New Wave\" thinking. But the film is solid overall; it has that uncanny feel to it \u2013 that feel and that clear sense of inspiration. It is most things from 1942's Casablanca to 1995's Before Sunrise, meshed into one and with a political agenda. It is a tragedy at the end of the day and rather impressively, I think we feel for those who lost their lives in Hiroshima that day in August 1945, as well as for the two leads themselves when certain revelations become apparent right near the end \u2013 which in itself is a pretty impressive achievement.",

Filmed in beautiful black and white, this haunting masterpiece is hard to shake off. It will stay with you for a long time.Equally haunting is the theme song the film opens and closes with. Even though we do not get to know too much about Miss Riva's Japanese lover, we do get to see how events for her during war time France played a key role in her life. Where are there in her reality when her lover smacks her in the face at the teahouse. That brings us back to our reality at that time, but not for long. When the rest of the story is told, we see these people for who they are,and how the memory of time and place relates to their affair. Will these memories and their aftermath ever allow them to reunite,is there hope forfor them to reunite? Do the events of the past shape the present or the future? Definitely not for the Spielberg ,Spiderman, or Adam Sandler crowd,this challenging film deserves all the credit that has been bestowed on it.Why cant they make them like this now as opposed to the hard sell, high concept \"films\" that make their way to the multiplexes on a weekly basis?

Without it no Wang Kar Wai, no Peter Greenaway (who 'stole' away its cinematographer) I am not sure what it ultimately 'said' about the bomb, the war or our fictional memories and desires... as it seems to seduce through absence rather than auteurist presence (at the other end of the spectrum to Goddard perhaps) but was content to puzzle its enigma.

While I loved some of the the director's other works (\"Night and Fog\" is brilliant), I was annoyed by the \"artsy\" tone of the film and the excessive reliance on New Wave sensibilities. I'll be honest and up front about this--I hate most of the Godard films I have seen and several of those of Resnais. Strange camera angles and the avoidance of normal movie conventions may impress some, but I felt lost. I hated the goofy poetry-like dialog that was used while scenes went back and forth between the lovers and documentary footage of the civilians of the Hiroshima post-blast. It seemed to trivialize and muddle the impact of their pain.So why did I give it a 3 and not a 1? Well, I have seen a lot of French films and there are some whose level of awfulness reaches far greater heights than this film (and there are some that are absolute masterpieces).

The attempt to purge one's memory of the tragedies of war and the loss of love, however painful, may be the only way that one can bear continuing on living.  But this process of forgetting is not permanent and is doomed to be re-lived...in the film, the pain is in re-living a past affair during WWII with a German soldier after Elle (Emmanuelle Riva), an actress, has an affair with a Japanese architect, Lui (Eiji Okada), in Hiroshima, Japan.  The pain of the horrific atomic bombing of Hiroshima is a tragedy Lui refuses to re-visit, particularly because it is Elle, an outsider, who recounts her perception of the events to him.  As the two of them drift apart then back together again (with the realization that she must return to Paris the next day), the pain of letting go overwhelms each of them in a different way.  Indeed, the world forgets its self-inflicted wounds and ex-lovers minimize the significance of their one-night stands, but the healing is never actually complete and the scars never disappear.

            "content": "Alain Resnais's Hiroshima Mon Amour is a psychoanalytical allegory of a French actress and Japanese architect caught in a one-night affair. Their relationship is in whole, composed of recollections of the actions leading up to and the consequences that follow the bombing of Hiroshima. Alain Resnais's dialogue heavy and artistically achieving film plays out much like a coalescence of Michelangelo Antonion's L'Avventura and Kar Wai Wong's In the Mood For Love, in that it takes a more obtuse approach at plot while depending on the idea of alluring love to drive it.While being set in Hiroshima, the film is shot in French. \"She,\" Emmanuelle Riva, is in Hiroshima to shoot a movie about peace, and on her last day there meets the French speaking \"He,\" Eiji Okada, a survivor of the Hiroshima blast. While he has driven his memories to forget what happened in Hiroshima, she has spent her years trying to escape, but ultimately to no avail, her hometown of Nevers.After falling in love with a German soldier during the occupation of France, \"She\" becomes shunned by her family and forced to live in their cellar. Once free, she discovers her lover murdered by the townspeople. She lives now only to never relinquish her first impossible love. \"He\" confesses this to be his first affair and wants nothing more than to be with her, endlessly trying to persuade her to stay in Hiroshima. While this is not her first affair, we begin to associate the possibility of the \"impossible love\" she speaks of to be the only thing she has to keep her going, dependent on reviving her fading memories in anyone she can.Resnais is very precise with purpose in HmA. The idea to let the protagonists endure the duration of the film nameless, leaving us to focus along with their affair, the psychoanalysis of not only a post-war Japan, but world, is presumably the intention of the film. HmA is rich with interpretation, so to confidently say the films purpose is limited to only the ramifications of a post-war world or the attempts of solace for a void existence, is something I can say is left for the individual to take with each viewing.Hiroshima Mon Amour to me is an incredibly impressive film, and serves as one of the most important pioneers of the artistic form in early cinema. One can easily see the gears of innovation and clairvoyance in all regards of HmA. For the film literate, this is a film that can be immensely educational and deeply appreciated, and is recommended by me as a must see film for a number of reasons. Hiroshima Mon Amour is truly a remarkable piece of film.",

            "content": "Two lovers are entwined in embrace, shot in close-up so that their bodies are twisted and joined together but their identities obscured. And then ash and sand suddenly cover every spot of their skin, and the historical and emotional baggage begin to weigh down on what would normally be a simple tryst, a quiet little affair. It is the horrific aftermath of Hiroshima soiling the bed and their passion. The woman, played by Emmanuelle Riva, is engaging in pillow talk of the most macabre kind, and the man, later revealed to be the Japanese and French speaking Eiji Okada, is busy shushing her and stroking and kissing instead. Only later does Resnais reveal what would add extra weight to these whispers; he was a soldier in the war while the bomb eradicated the city and his family - she a nurse, then actually an actress, and long ago chastised for crossing the boundaries that war so harshly marks. Resnais is one of the few directors to have mastered the flashback, which is an easy tool to incorporate but harder to submerge it within the consciousness of the character that revisits the past. In first and foremost the haunting Night and Fog, and later Marienbad and Muriel, among others of his repertoire, he crafted a use for the technique not as a storytelling device to convey information but as a way of investigating the tricky nature of memory and truth - and how they can be warped over time. Amidst the longer journeys into the past, Resnais imbues a sense of selective and wilful forgetfulness into his documentary-type footage. His compositions show the wide extent of the devastation of the a- bomb, and then jump back into the more immediate past, where the camera tracks faceless visitors of the museum that contains all the irrevocable evidence. He will align the camera with a figure walking through the hospitals and seeing the patients with its own eyes, only for Okada to quickly interrupt with an objection of this first hand experience. This is contested with harrowing images that speak for themselves; masses of lost hair, scraps of twisted metal, insects emerging from the ash and bodies with all sorts of deformations - only to dissolve to the pair stroking and whispering of each other's beautiful skin, actions which slowly begin to become laden with guilt. The pair's dialogue reveal themselves to be more or less realists about the whole situation. They work in strange and sometimes foreign locations, far away from the family - their short-lived affairs are symbolic of the post-war displacement of the family unity. They have done this before, and expect to do this again. The woman freely flaunts her 'dubious morals', more risqu\u00e9 than most of the women of the screen of her time, and playfully assumes the man will feel the same way when she has to leave the next day. But Resnais probes, using one of his favoured techniques, and pieces of memory begin to emerge from this front: a brief match-cut flashing a likeness to one of the corpses of the past. Drink lowers the last of her inhibitions and she bravely recounts her tale. The visual mastery of the film is evident. Whilst she excavates the past and the camera drifts along the river Nevers, bicycling in the open fields and her butchered hair paraded through the streets in full daylight, the darkness of the bar closes in on the pair until Riva's pale face is the last refuge in almost pitch black. She is slowly positioned to have the reflections of the river hit her eyes as she gets deeper into her story, until ghostly tendrils and wisps of feeble light dance over her profile and softly illuminate the single tear falling from her left eye while the right side is all but submerged. And when she walks along the streets of the city at night Resnais employs a dramatically skewed low angle so the buildings, dark as they are and flickering with cold light, tower over her tiny figure, emblematic of a modernity that has left the human behind. Hiroshima mon amour was made in the aftermath of one of the more frightening events in our recent history. It depicts a time where the bomb, a symbol for the wider technological advancements of the age, was thought by some to be overshadowing and overpowering human nature. We had knowledge and use of guns and missiles before, but never had mass murder been quite so impersonal, and never had we been able to wield a weapon with such deadly potential for long term devastation. It was technology beyond moral sense, and more sophisticated than the human spirit and intelligence that had designed and overseen its deployment. The film fashions its response in the personal connection of two lovers in the newer, stranger Hiroshima, still trying desperately to rebuild and move on from the past. First, they convince themselves this is like any other affair they have embarked on, and that in a few years all will be forgotten. Then, they try to bury history but in doing so only unlock past traumas. They seek solace in physical action, and a hope that time will stop for them (throughout Okada is attempting to convince her to extend her stay) - again, a fruitless endeavour. It is finally through a refusal of denial that they find a new starting point. The mistakes of the past are voiced clearly and out loud, and only then can we begin to move forward.",

(And, as it turned out, that wasn't necessarily a good thing) HMA certainly started off quite promising. It began as something of a pseudo-documentary that screened vintage, newsreel footage showcasing the devastating aftermath effects of the A-bomb once it had been dropped on the city of Hiroshima in 1945.I was actually quite shocked by these horrific images of burn-victims (and such) who managed to survive this monstrous blast of mass destruction.Following this startling and impressive opening sequence, HMA abruptly shifted gears as it morphed into a weepy, little Chick Flick, where (through flashbacks) Elle retold (in the minutest detail) the tragedy of her lost virginity and public humiliation at 18.You can be sure that after being witness to the visual horrors of Hiroshima, the recycled memories of Elle's deflowering seemed quite pathetic and almost laughable by comparison.Following this dragged-out episode (which took Elle a whole half hour to get it out of her system), HMA then \"mutated\" (literally) into a major \"WTF!?\" soap opera which highlighted Elle & Lui's puzzling, dime-store romance that was quickly coming to an end.This whole business had me wishing, and hoping, and praying that the ground would suddenly open up, swallow these 2, and, with that, promptly put this movie out of its pain and misery for good.Unless HMA was deliberately meant as some sort of weird audience-torture, I honestly don't see the point that French film-maker, Alain Resnais was trying to get across with this 3-in-1 cinematic montage. But, whatever it was, I'd say that he clearly missed the mark.",

            "content": "\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" is another bomb-centric, left-winged, political romance by \"Nouvelle Vague\" mainstay Alain Resnais. It centers on a young actress, landing a part in an anti-war picture being filmed in Hiroshima, Japan. Hiroshima, as you know, is the heart of the one of the world's most shocking attacks, the droppings of the atomic bomb, \"Little Boy\", by the United States of America. There, she meets a charming, dashing Japanese man, and by nightfall, they engage in hot, sparkly intercourse. As they make love, \"She\" keeps thinking of the tragedy of Hiroshima. \"She\" remembers being there. \"She\" remembers the children that died, the diseases that aroused, the buildings petrified and the shadows of the people that perished solidified in the ground below. \"He\" tries to figure out why she is saying such horrible things while lovemaking. Is it the fact that she's in an anti-war picture, or did she know about Hiroshima? After days of questioning and conversation, it is revealed that \"She\" has chosen to engage in such a love affair after losing her lover during the war, back in her home in Nevers, France. She was in love with a German soldier. Considering the political implications of what the Nazis did to France during WWII, her entire family was unbelievably outraged. They punished her by locking her underneath the house and shredding her beautiful hair to pieces. \"She\" is a rebel, and perhaps a traitor of her own country, but she did it out of love for her man. \"She\" and \"He\" bond over such an intimate, taboo tale and proceed to psychologically torture each other in furious, politically charged lust. Not only were they longing for each other, they were longing for revenge. \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\", is in essence, an open-handed slap in the face to allied powers of WWII. It's a message, not just of anti-nukes, but a complete rejection of national pride, in favor of lustful revenge. Resnais's political implications are brash to say the least, but through his anger at the destructive nature of the war, he constructed one of the most passionate, incredible love stories of all time. It's a romance of death. It's a movie that refuses to accept the sorrow around itself, and locks itself deep within the arms of the weak and powerless. Many people say that sleep is the best revenge and sometimes it's good living, but here, good loving. The performances sold the entire thing for me. Vastly overlooked for her performance is the lovely Emmanuelle Riva, as \"She\". Only now, as an elderly woman is she getting her award show dues, but what else can you expect from the Academy? They never recognize the best performances when they're right in front of them. I truly believed these two as lovers, and I wouldn't be any bit surprised if a real relationship budded behind the scenes.",

The affair triggers memories of the actress' first love affair with a German soldier in occupied France.The film's main concerns seem to be memory and it's relation to the present and healing. The film is beautifully made with a poetic and elegant screenplay from novelist Marguerite Duras, but it remained curiously uninvolving. All the style and formality prevented any real engagement with the characters. It also suffers from moments of monumental pretentiousness. It is worth watching for World Cinema fans, just because of it's reputation, but others should really approach with caution.",

            "content": "When, a few years ago I was first getting into \"foreign\" movies, I had bought this DVD, mainly because my Halliwells Film Guide rated it so highly. It was so outstandingly daring and different to anything I'd ever seen, I was totally immersed in both its ugliness and yes, its sheer beauty.I wanted to give it 10/10 on the IMDb, but chickened out and settled for 9. From the very opening gritty black & white of the intertwined limbs of the lovers, artistically exploring each other like uncoiling snakes and then the inter-cut of a scarred and scorched fatality of the Hiroshima bomb, then the sober and poetic voice-over of a French woman....Yes, I was hooked and I am again, five years later, viewing again for the second time. I've many, many more world cinema films these days and my knowledge of them has expanded enormously, but Hiroshima Mon Amour will always hold a special place within me.It might be the photographer in me - some of images and compositions are absolutely arresting - and I'm not talking about the highly detailed studies of human deformity or of singed corpses either, or perhaps the poet in me. There is a clockwork pace of languid calm about it all, that is highly compelling - the Japanese architect and the French actress talking openly, candidly, slowly, as only lovers seem to be able to do in the best films, about their lives. Her experiences in France. Her previous loves.There's a real sense of Carl von Dreyer's superb sense of simplicity and harrowed beauty plus a Francois Truffaut gift for storytelling. That this is Alain Resnais' first film is quite extraordinary.The title, is so apt - It is a love story, a beautiful one and also a terrible one. Sometimes you really do have to travel to 'hell-on-earth' to fully appreciate love and beauty. France itself (this is a French film - and in the French language) is a major nuclear weapon super-power now and the feeling of guilt by association that the viewer feels is nerve-wrenchingly poignant at times, keeping one on edge. How the new architecture that is rebuilding Hiroshima from its ashes is both interesting and strange; how it conflicts with its past but is equally, its future. How the pastoral peace of France that we see in her memories compete - and compare with where she is now - and what she is doing.I'm not going to tell everyone to buy it; many will be repulsed by some of the distressing imagery, though this is featured mostly at the beginning, so in this matter, it does get easier. Some will be put off by the measured pace, the floating cameras, the dreamy sense of 'are we there, or not?'It might well be another five years before I see Hiroshima Mon Amour again - like tonight it won't be planned, it'll be impromptu but somehow, I'm looking forward to it already.",

With cinematography at its best, Resnais displays an extraordinary juxtaposition between the main woman-character's past romance with Hiroshima's past destruction. While the French-woman and the Japanese-man present the \"current\" love affair of the movie, Hiroshima Mon Amour actually takes place beyond the couple. Primarily dealing with the past, but looking forward to the future, the main characters, really the French-woman but including Hiroshima, deal with their histories even if they are forgotten. The terse, poetic dialogue unfurls the story's complexities with absolute grace, but still leaves much to the imagination. The cinematography is resplendent, but desolate; dreamy, but honest; innovative, but elementary; and above all: beautiful, but heartbreaking. Even to-day, there is not a film like this. Comparable only to itself. To not see this film: is to not see the world of celluloid from all of its seemingly-diversified angles. This film is so different, you may not like it the first time you see it. I didn't. But it warrants subsequent viewings. Absolutely. Then it allures you. Beckons more.

Resnais strikes me as one of the best(or THE best) director coming out of the french new wave. \"Hiroshima Mon amour\" it before it's time and should be praised for it's audacity. Alain Resnais is a big step forward for modernity. He's often overshadowed by attention addicts like Godard, but he definitively is(in my opinion) the most impressive director of all the new wave.",

            "content": "A French actress meets a Japanese architect in Hiroshima while filming a movie about peace. It's 1959 and the shadow of the Atom Bomb still looms over the city and its people. The two share a night of intimacy but she's due to return to Paris in 24 hours, and in that time the man tries to convince her to stay.The simplicity of Hiroshima Mon Amour's premise hides the fact that it deals with one of the most important aspects of of human existence: memory and forgetfulness. In a superficial it's about the forgetfulness of history: the woman in describing her memories of the day the bomb fell in Hiroshima, explains that at first she felt astonished, then astonished at the fact they did it, then became indifferent. That's so painful because it's true - no matter how horrible something may happen, sooner or later it'll be forgotten, or absorbed by our consciousness until it fits with everything else and it's just another memory, devoid of any importance; like Hiroshima after a while.Paradoxically, the woman is haunted by one memory she can't forget, something that in comparison to Hiroshima, pales in its insignificance: a war-time love affair with a German soldier. It was the experience that defines her existence and fourteen years later she still can't forget it. When the Japanese man asks her to explain why she can't stay, she tells him this story and how much it means to her.This movie shows how much memories create our identity and how much the past can have hold of our present actions, how powerful they can be that they stop us from building a future. I was reminded at times of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but whereas that movie shows how our good memories are important for our happiness, Resnais and Marguerite Duras' movie shows the negative side.The movie's cinematography impressed me for its use of newsreels mixed with the film narrative. The first fifteen movies show a voice over dialogue between the man and the woman as they talk about Hiroshima, cutting back and forth between close-ups of their naked bodies in bed with footage from Hiroshima, some even from the time Hiroshima was hit with the Atom Bomb, not sparing the viewer from the horrors the explosion created - burned children, men with their jaws missing, empty eye-sockets. As we witness these horrors the soothing, suave voice of the woman discourses about what the city. It's difficult to explain how sad it i.The movie is known for having pioneered the use of cutting small flashbacks with scenes in the present to give the impression of flashes of memory. Most of these have to do with the tragic love story the woman had during WWII.The lead actors give amazing performances. I was happy to recognize Eiji Okada as the man; just the day before I had seen him in Woman In The Dunes, in which his performance dominated. But here ultimate praise must go to Emmanuelle Riva. She transmitted so much sadness and confusion I was overwhelmed by her.I had before watched Resnais Last Year In Marienbad and hadn't enjoyed it: too indefinite, too cold, too experimental for my taste. Both movies are quite similar in cinematography, although I'd give the edge to 'Marienbad' for its slightly surrealistic touches. But the themes of memory, forgetfulness, time are present in both. Why I love this movie, however, is because Resnais and his screenwriter, Marguerite Duras, created a credible, heartbreaking love story to develop their themes in an enjoyable and accessible manner.I think anyone who enjoys human relationships will find it impossible not to be moved by the story of Hiroshima Mon Amour.",

Maybe I'm missing something, or am just not interested in whatever-it-is.I can't even see that it was exciting in 1959. The biggest thing wrong with it is this: the characters are two-dimensional. You get no real sense of them as people. Even their nominal professions (he an architect, she an actor) get no depth. The scenes where she's supposedly on the 'set' of her 'movie' were laughable. In short, I didn't care about what happened to them. As it turns out, more-or-less nothing does.One thing that was totally true-to-life was their interminable \"let's have one more night\"/\"let's never see each other again\"/\"let's be together forever\" to-ing and fro-ing over their third or fourth or fifteenth beer. Yes, just as tedious and shallow as the real thing: playing this Saturday night at any convenient bar in your town.I can't recall a movie I've enjoyed less. I kept waiting for something - anything - to happen. It didn't. All we get is a few more flashbacks to the sketchy 'what I did during the war' back-story. Everything is superficial. None of it was interesting or insightful.The friends I saw it with (at a screening at the NSW Art Gallery) all agreed. We've worked out a code to escape in the future.

It starts with seemingly random ramblings over footage of the aftermath from the Hiroshima bombing. I feared that the movie would never show the people talking and this was what I was going to have to watch for 90 minutes. Thankfully, there is a movie in here about 2 star-crossed lovers. I appreciated that it had at least a modicum of plot even if it wasn't exactly a strong narrative film. Most of the movie is still spent in reflection as the 2 protagonists share the traumas of their past and relate them to the tragic fate of the people in Hiroshima. As is typical for this type of movie, I find myself longing for more to happen.Hiroshima mon Amour is a film that is more internal in its storytelling, which leaves me frustrated. I know others thrive on this kind of existential story, it simply doesn't click with me. I've certainly seen worse movies that lack any cohesive plot, so I can't chastise Hiroshima Mon Amour that much. In fact, I enjoyed some of the flashback scenes when we actually learn something about Elle's past. If that was the plot of this movie, I think I could genuinely be intrigued for the full runtime. That's a more interesting star-crossed lover tale than the one we see between Elle and Lui. But that's not where the writer and director want to take this story.

I wonder if I can explain.Enough has been said about film's importance in the history of of French New Wave Cinema. To know how much, or how little, Resnais takes from earlier masters of the European or American Cinema is of certain significance also. Even with this and more information of the sorts, I'm afraid you will see nothing in Hiroshima. Well, then, what should one see in Hiroshima? To me, the question is not what, but how.You can not see Hiroshima without not seeing it. You cannot simply find your way into the heart of darkness with mere open eyes. First you simply see and go on; then you stop in your lanes, think back, your ryes closed; so, back you go, and see again: no horse of different color, but somewhere, some time during this visual trip, you will learn to see Hiroshima. Gradually.Only then the Hiroshima of film, the city fallen apart, will reveal its broken heart: a wasteland in n dimensions. Actors, otherwise merely doing their wooden jobs, would be seen performing rituals. Monotonous images will grab at your eyes, empty scenery will take away your breath, hollow moves will boggle your mind.What strikes me most about Hiroshima the film is how it looks like Hiroshima the city. Both are full of contrasts, clearly out of focus. Eeach has got its rituals and its realities. Rituals and realities like love and death, companionship and desolation, achievement and deprivation, peace and war, desire and fear. The movie slowly moves into its subject matter, effortlessly merges with it, becomes it. Lopsided dialog thus finds way to gnaw at your heart, interminable soliloquies start searching your soul.To see, in real time, that ritual and reality are its two sides, one needs the coin to be standing on edge, if only for a moment.

After a single night, they fall madly in love with each other, convinced that the sex they had was deep and meaningful, so deep and meaningful, in fact, that when they cheat on their respective spouses with other paramours in the future, as they have every intention of so doing, they think that it will never be as good as what they have with each other right now. Of course, if they were free to marry each other, they would probably be cheating on each other in a couple years too, but that either does not seem to occur to them, or it occurs to them, but they don't care, because they are the kind of people who think they are entitled to cheat.Although the movie is set in Hiroshima, where reference is naturally made to the atom bomb, this proves to be nothing more than a way of providing an excuse for Elle to talk about what she was doing in France when the bomb went off. From there she eventually tells about how she loved a German soldier, who was killed by a sniper, and how she was ostracized for having sex with him, causing her to have a nervous breakdown. She thinks that German soldier was the great love of her life, but given the kind of woman she is, we know that she would have been cheating on him in no time.Since the movie is set in Hiroshima, and since Lui is a Japanese citizen, you might think Elle's story about how she suffered so much during the war would be matched by a story from Lui about his experience during that period. Nope. All we get is that he was in the army. Well, after all, this is a French movie and not a Japanese movie, so it is only the French experience that the movie deems worthy of consideration.",

Basically the film is a 36 hour long period and conversation between French actress Elle (BAFTA nominated Emmanuelle Riva), referred to a She, and Japanese architect Lui (Eiji Okada), referred to as He. They have a brief relationship and are now separating, talking about failed relationships they compare them to the bombing of Hiroshima, and perspectives and incidents from inside and outside the attack are seen in documentary footage. It is an interesting structure of repetitive dialogue, mostly narration over small flashbacks of her life, her youth and punishment for a forbidden love affair with a German soldier (Bernard Fresson), and of course the documentary footage of the August 6 1945 Second World War Hiroshima atomic bombing, the main themes of this film are memory and oblivion. Also starring Stella Dallas as Mother and Pierre Barbaud as Father. The film is rated well by critics, but to be honest I don't know if I can completely agree, I found the film a bit too talkative at times, the intimacy stuff is good, and the harrowing footage of the bombing effects, victim injuries and the devastation, is most effective, so for that I found something interesting in it, overall it's an alright drama, in my opinion. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen, and it won the BAFTA for the UN Award, and it was nominated for Best Film from any Source.

            "content": "A perusal of many of the internet reviews of Alain Resnais' first feature marks it as quite a polarizing film. For many, either you loved it or hated it. For those who couldn't stand it, I would still argue that it has some very impressive cinematography as well as an interesting existential message for us all.Nonetheless I must agree that the relationship between the two principal characters, the French actress Elle (Emmanuelle Riva) and Japanese architect Lui (Eiji Okada), is absurd. We're introduced to this couple who are having a quickie affair in Hiroshima as Elle is finishing up her role in an Internationally funded peace film featuring protests against spreading nuclear proliferation throughout the world.Elle just has a day left before she flies back to Paris but Lui is so besotted with her that he wants her to stay in Hiroshima. If you believe in \"love at first sight\" and lovers bonding after only knowing one another for a few hours, then you'll buy this idea of an improbable whirlwind romance.But it soon becomes obvious that Resnais doesn't have much of a desire to flesh out his characters but rather aims to deliver a deep existential message about the ultimate meaninglessness, disappointment and tragedy of life.Resnais' visually masterful introduction, which includes footage of Hiroshima atomic bomb victims, features a male voice castigating the female narrator that she can never truly grasp the enormity of the tragedy despite being able to view the tangible memories of the event which can be clearly seen as we follow tourists viewing various artifacts on display at the Hiroshima Museum.While the collective devastating nature of the deadly bombing is revealed at the beginning of the film, Elle imparts her own personal tragedy to Lui growing up in the French Town of Nevers. There she fell in love with a German soldier who was part of the occupation force, only to view him gunned down on the day of liberation.Elle finds that her relationship with Lui has rekindled her feelings for the long gone soldier and reawakened memories that she had long forgotten. Ultimately the passage of time makes us all realize about the insubstantiality of life and that once we die the memory of our existence, deeds and actions will eventually be forgotten. The same could be said for the tragedy of Hiroshima-despite the previously alluded to \"enormity\" of what occurred.Resnais probably could have made his point in less than the hour and 45 minutes shown here. By the time the couple grapples with the issue of staying or not staying, we've really seen enough.Riva, who went on to be an actress of great stature, is excellent in the role of a woman with all the rekindled memories leading to a great deal of cognitive dissonance. Okada remarkably didn't speak a word of French and memorized all the lines phonetically. Unlike Riva's part however, we never find out exactly why he falls so hard for this woman except for the fact that she's extremely intelligent and sensitive.For those who didn't like the film, I would urge you to upgrade your ratings considering the excellent cinematography and the exploration of some profound existential messages. For those who liked the film, why not downgrade your rating a bit?-because after all, these are hardly fleshed out human beings!",

It's meant to be some sort of analogy for interracial love amidst world wars and tragedies - but it's just trash. The characters stand around and postulate incoherently and endlessly about Hiroshima, love, their pasts...from what I care to remember. I watched this because I had read so much about it and Alain Resnais that as a film student I felt I had to see it. It's insulting to writers, and to audiences too. I still cannot get over how terrible the writing was. Duras's attempts at semi-poetic symbolism, her inflated dialogue and her tendency to write rambling, pompous monologues for the two characters make this whole thing a chore to sit through.",

            "content": "Honestly, I really really really want to like this film. It's a historical story, about two people from different backgrounds, in a city I'd love to visit. Even the title itself is so inviting and I was really excited to watch it. My exact reaction after the movie ended was: \"What? Did anyone understand what was going on?\" I watched it for a Film studies class, so was asking my fellow classmates, who seemed to be just as confused as I was.The acting from the start is a little awkward and static. I don't feel the connection between the two who are supposed to be in a romantic relationship and it seems like Elle has a little bit of a mental problem. She would suddenly just burst out at times. Maybe I'm just not romantic enough to like this but I was seriously in a little pain while watching this.I read an article by Jennifer Barker, in which she talks of phenomenology and the way that touch is used in this film to help Elle remember her traumatic past which in turn helps her to connect more to the incident of Hiroshima. Reading that, it all makes sense, but I would still rather read it than watch the movie. The article, probably because it was explaining the movie was so much clearer. I guess in a way I can see what the movie is doing, and maybe I just don't have the eye for detail but it went by too slowly for me.However the cinematography was pretty great, there was some great panning and tracking shots which helped to set the mood. Also, the juxtaposition with scenes of the past and the present was pretty well done, and was not confusing at all. Though the script does make it confusing in the present when Elle suddenly refers to Lui as her former lover.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",

I was not planning to see it again, but I was taking a film course when I was 21, and was forced to see it for the third time, and it was here that it really got me. For me the film is so poetic, its images so beautifully realized and put together. Till 1981, before we had videos for TV, I would see it another 4 times, always getting something more from it.That one reviewer has suggested that this film is anti American, well what is there to say about that. First of all, it is not about how bad Americans are. the film really is about what happened to this woman in the town of Nevers in France during the occupation by the Germans. It only used the springing off point of Hiroshima and the events that befell that city to really tell its story of this woman. The film is also not anti German, without giving anything away. In fact the people who might have more to complain are the French. Safe to say, I think the film is about the Hiroshimas many people have in their private lives, who had to live through wars, and their tragic aftermaths.Little footnote, my other 6 greatest films ever made are, Citizen Kane, Third Man, Once Upon A Time in the West, Godfather Part II, Ran, Schindler's List.",

Before that, narrative structure was rather linear, and any deviations were well marked and clear. The great thing about \"Hiroshima\" was that it was one of the first films where the viewer had to assemble pieces of both stories at the same time made all that much more challenging by having the flashbacks appear out of their own chronological order.",

It is a very slow movie with a tremendous impact.What I found especially moving was the way the movie correlates the world-renown tragedy with the heroine's own \"small\" personal tragedy.We usually find it hard to identify with a large-scale tragic event. In some sense, tragedy (and mourning) is always experienced as a personal and individual event. Tragedy is best conveyed on a personal basis. Hence the power the small, personal tragedy have over us. 300 dead people in a plane crash is news, a little girl with cancer is tragedy.Hiroshima is far to big to be seen on this level - the dialog in the extremely powerful opening scene demonstrate it (in a way which I can only describe as a testament to the genius of this collaboration of Resnais and Duras ).Therefore the small tragedy is used to convey what Hiroshima as a whole will not - the feeling of personal loss as a victim of a war over which we do not have any power.The setting and the the heroine's lover give us the perspective in which the personal tale is to be viewed. This is best summarized in the two short lines between the heroine and her lover which end the movie.",

He does not try to rush pictures at the viewer to fill you to the limits of your visual capacity, or bombard your ears with loud scene driving music, yet he uses every tool available to the movie artist to create an emotional journey through time and space, memories and awareness. This movie moved me!!!!! It explored memory, emotion, and identity not in two or three, but in four dimensions. We get to see a whole functioning person, see them broken down to the formative moments in their lives and then emerge clean and whole, now able to be created and recreated moment by ever-changing moment. Hiroshima Mon Amour is a film that explores the fine line between memory and present time and insanity and reality. I see experience and memory as two facets of consciousness. In this world where external stimulation keeps increasing as we get more technologically advanced, our brains can't assimilate all of this new information we're taking in every second of the day, so instead we file it away in big waste baskets of our mind. If we give our selves `a moment of quiet' to sort through the day at some time in our daily activities we can usually pick out what was important and let the rest go. In this way we whittle down that enormous amount of stimulation to a plateful that we can get our lips around, grasp and ingest it into our memories. When something extreme has happened that is so huge to us that we can't break it down into smaller, bite size pieces, instead it may just lurk in our sub-consciousness taking up space and casting a shadow over our mind. Until we have grown in ourselves to a point where we feel we can take this experience in, it will remain with us as a constant companion, never allowing you to be fully present in the moment because some part of you is still lingering at the moment when the extreme situation happened to you.",

I didn't find it sexist( the slap? if a character is, does that mean the entire film is as well?), or merely the tale of two cultures meeting. A Japanese architect whose family was in Hiroshima when the bomb fell, and a French actress in the city to shoot a film about \"peace\", have an affair. The first 20 minutes are incredible, disturbing, and haunting, \"I saw the sorrow of Hiroshima\", she says in bed, \"You saw nothing\" he responds. The two are both married, have an intense affair, that despite or maybe because there meeting is omitted, is made all the more sensual, desperate, and genuine. The music and cinematography is flawless. The actresses story dominates for the most part there after, she recounts her first love and disgrace, retold in flashbacks, one of even greater cultural taboos, and I imagine a critique of French politics of collusion in WW2. But there's more here than just politics and to look at this film on only a political level is to miss, the heart of the film, which is not that love conquers all, but that desire is irrepressible and has no social or moral compass. It can bring despair and ruin, or come from the ashes of the same place. Pain cannot be separated from pleasure, ever, or both diminish and wither away in memory. The architect imagines, he understands her story, just as she imagines she understands his, both know they don't, or cant, and want to know anyway. That isn't the kind of love that your grandparents share or don't, maybe its more desire than anything else, but it is love, true as any. And as for the ending feeling incomplete, thats how it should be, staring at each other from across the room in silence, saying to someone else, what you mean for that person to hear.",

            "content": "\"Hiroshima mon amour\" is as the title already tells us a French French-language movie from 1959, so this one has its 60th anniversary this year. At pretty much exactly 90 minutes, it is not a really long film by any means. Director is Alain resnais, still today one of France's most famous, but maybe the more notable inclusion here is writer Marguerite Duras and while female writers weren't a complete exception back then, it was still unusual, especially because she was also nominated for sn Oscar for her penning. And the other star here is lead actress Emmanuelle Riva, who came to more glory recently with Haneke's Amour, but sadly died not too long ago. She is the star in this 2-people piece we have here without a doubt, acting-wise far superior to her male counterpart played by Eiji Okada, who certainly looked much younger than he was. But Riva also has the better material of the two, which is not too surprising. They are really only equals if at all early on when we hear them talk about Hiroshima and what happened/happens there while seeing photos of the gruesome medical aftermath of the bomb from World War II. I had a feeling it would go on like this for the entire film, but it did not and I was kinda glad. Still I must say everything afterward was not really on a better level sadly. This black-and-white movie never won me over with the focus on the relationship between a French actress and a Japanese student. They are only speaking in French though, so don't worry if you don't speak Japanese. You don't have to, even if th film is set here. The action then moves on to him falling more for her than she does for him. Back then confessing love quickly apparently was also not a big deal. Rest of the film is basically her playing hard to get with her immediate departure to Japan looming over them. But then there is moments when you think she has feelings for him too and then there is that scene when she makes him jealous with another guy approaching her and so on. It's back and forth really. I felt kinda sorry for him, even if I honestly did not care for the character. And Riva's pretty stunning looks can only make up for so much. Also did not hep with the characters' likability that both are married and ready to start into this affair. The ending then is mostly as open as you'd expext. Oh well with how much I like Riva (did not recognize her here though), how well this film was received and is still remembered today, the imdb rating etc. I would have expected to like it more honestly and I honestly also feel that the confusing love story between the duo at the center of it all does no justice to what happened in this city tragically at the end of World War II. I have seen other films (D\u00f6rrie) that deal even worse with the subject, so it is probably a challenge to come up with something worthy, but it must get better than this. Most of the talking and dialogues in here did feel a bit fake to me. All in all, a thumbs-down and negative recommendation. Watch something else instead. Even I as somebody who likes old films francais I was underwhelmed by this one here. Or if you watch, then at least keep your expectations low beforehand because otherwise you will get disappointed. I for once was glad it did not run for another 20 minutes or even over two hours. Skip.",

            "content": "There is no getting around the fact that film auteur Alain Resnais' 1959 masterwork can be challenging to sit through, but there are certainly moments of emotional potency in this deep-dive examination of a passionate love affair whose fate is governed by inescapable memories. Written by acclaimed French novelist Margeurite Duras, the seemingly threadbare story covers the 24-hour arc of the relationship between a French actress, making an anti-nuclear movie in Hiroshima, and a Japanese architect. Both are married, but that inconvenience seems incidental to the plot since the actress is more pervasively haunted by a doomed WWII romance with a German soldier during the Nazi occupation. Her intense feelings toward the architect have an intractable bond to her past.In a groundbreaking narrative technique that can be seen in movies as recent as this year's \"Babel\", Resnais freely manipulates time and jumps between past and present in order to induce a cathartic response from the actress character. The film's opening is legendary as we see erotic images of intertwined naked torsos first covered in what looks like nuclear ash, then with radioactive sparkles and finally in post-coital sweat. However, the next sequence is even more daring, relentlessly showing the devastation of the 1945 A-bomb in Hiroshima through artifacts in the Peace Museum (which are still there) and painful footage from a 1952 Japanese feature film, \"Children of Hiroshima\", which shows the human toll in graphic detail. All the while, the actress expresses her empathy for the events, while the architect counters that she could not comprehend the scope of the impact. This disparity is what provides the impetus to the plot toward the inevitable conclusion.In her feature film debut, Emmanuelle Riva powerfully provides the film's emotional center as the actress, while the superb Eiji Okada makes the architect's obsession with her palpable. As with most of Resnais' films, the cinematography is masterful with deliberately composed shots that linger in the memory - Michio Takahashi did the Hiroshima sequences, while Sacha Vierny handles the flashbacks around Nevers, France. The 2003 Criterion Collection DVD gratefully contains their standard pristine print transfer, as well as several notable extras - an informative if rather academic commentary track from film historian Peter Cowie; two vintage interviews with Resnais, one from 1961 and the other an audio-only talk done in 1980; a staged interview with Riva at the 1959 Cannes Film Festival and a recent one conducted in 2003 specifically for the DVD; and excerpts of Duras' script annotations spoken over selected film scenes.",

            "content": "A first-time encounter with Resnais' accepted Rive Gauche masterpiece, Hiroshima MON AMOUR, a doleful exploration of the post-holocaust psyche between a French woman (Riva) and a Japanese man (Okada) in Hiroshima, she comes to this alien land to shoot a pacifist film, and he is a local architect.After the tantalising opening sequences where two naked bodies amorously twisting, caressing under a rain of dust or maybe some ash - is it referring the radiation after the nuclear bomb attack? Hard to tell, Resnais, starts the film with his documentarist narration of the unnamed French woman, aka, she, wanders in the hospital, the war museum as a distant outsider in his superlative dollying shots, observes the damage a decade later, with physical abnormality and disfigurement on the surface, but what about the inside?She and he, mutually attracted to each other for a dalliance, but soon her troubled memories are induced by the burgeoning romance, at the same year of the nuke tragedy, in a small French town Nevers, her love affair with a German soldier (Fresson) comes to a halt after his death, she became the shame of her family and the talk of the town, locked in the cellar, her mind was on the verge of a breakdown. Now, years later, in Hiroshima, she indulges in a passionate rendezvous with him, a suave Japanese man, who evokes her deceased lover and she must undergo a distressing process of uncovering old scars in front of him, frankly and unconditionally. Moreover, within one day, she is leaving Hiroshima forever, is there a possibility that she can stay here with him, even just for a few more days? She has one night to decide.Marguerite Duras wrote the screenplay specifically for this film, which granted her an Oscar nomination, the westerner-meets-oriental milieu is in her familiar soil, e.g. her autobiographical taboo relationship in THE LOVER (1992), but here, her formulaic-ally repeated, essayistic monologue and dialogue, coalesce seamlessly with the magic editing, which jumps back-and-forth between present and flashback, sharply project the frisson of a soul tormented by the consequences of the war, a fatalistic blow to any sensible mind, the damage has done, it is irrevocable, and irredeemable.Emmanuelle Riva, what an impeccable actress on screen, transcends the minimalistic story to express such an emotional, heartrending breaking-down of her character's ordeal and shares a tender yet wavering chemistry with Eiji Okada, whom one might think lesser due to his mechanical articulation (he couldn't speak French so everything he says is phonetically recited).In the end, he is Hiroshima and she becomes Nevers, their individuality vanishes, what they personify are two disparate countries, living under the shadow of the loathsome war, can never take a deep breath since it still hurts underneath.",

I found its love story tedious and pretentious; but that's a separate, insignificant matter). No, I found it offensive because I can't stand it when movies use atrocities as their playbox, as impressive backdrops left unexplored. Splicing newsreels of Hiroshima's devastation into a love story is a disservice to those who were devastated by this tragedy, in my opinion. I gives me the same feeling as Hotel Rwanda did: the complete failure of trying to explain/comprehend a human tragedy of epochal proportions by focusing on the individual story of a couple/family. This kind of approach is so open to interpretation, so light and inadequate, that it just falls flat on its face, in my opinion. Obviously, if you enjoyed it, good for you, but for my taste, whenever I see photos/newsreel footage of stuff like the Holocaust or Rwanda or Hiroshima, I want the movie to focus only on that, with the seriousness and dryness of a documentary. Cutting to a love story is to me a complete let-down, no matter how tragic or pensive that one love story may be. So in my opinion, Alain Resnais, the director of this movie, got it right four years earlier with his 1955 \"Nuit et brouillard\" (Night and Fog), which looks at concentration camps not through a love story, but through a strikingly direct and blunt documentary.I understand and appreciate that people get other things from \"Hiroshima mon amour\": contemplations on love, forgiveness, forgetfulness, etc. But please, use some other setting as a backdrop for these contemplations. Because whether the filmmakers intended this or not, the viewer's mind inevitably compares the tragedy of the lovers' affairs with the tragedy of Hiroshima. And that's just such a lopsided comparison that even the slightest insinuation of it is completely distasteful.",

            "content": "Before starting to write about my thoughts on the film, I need to say that Akira Kurosawa's one of the masterpieces, Rhapsody in August and Wong Kar Wai's masterpiece In The Mood for Love are two of my all time favorite movies. Hiroshima Mon Amour is similar with those movies in terms of theme and style both, but it cannot be as touching and impressive as those movies. Resnais overly uses voice over technique in this movie and after a while it becomes almost unbearable, because poetic structure surpasses realism. It is like the movie is built on memoirs, so you feel like the characters aren't there really. The movie is not only a love story, but also it tries to be an elegy for the tragedy, Hiroshima Nagasaki, however, the movie can't handle all these themes including the woman's past as the third story. So what is the movie about? A forbidden love story? A woman's past tragedies? An elegy for Hiroshima Nagazaki? or all? The film could be poetic, romantic, but it is not that subtle or deep or beautiful in my opinion. On Hiroshima Nagazaki, Rhapsody was much better. On love, Fa Yeung Nin Wa was much better. As for the actor, the actress and overall acting, I didn't know the male lead, also I didn't know that the female lead is Amour's great Emmanuelle Riva at that time, however, unfortunately I have to say that Riva'a acting in this movie was weak and the man was not better than her. It is interesting that Riva reminded me Monica Vitti, the most beautiful European actress ever along with Claudia Cardinale for me, but the funny thing is that I don't adore Mrs. Vitti's acting either. By the way, I believe that this movie is mostly for women, women's favorite movie, it rather affects women like Jodie Foster's The Brave One (as I know, some female audiences cheered up in the finale of that movie) Also, I couldn't empathize with the woman, I couldn't feel her, I couldn't empathize with the man either, probably the dead pan story telling. I couldn't feel the passion in the love story, in fact I couldn't see love in this film, in contrast I found it uninspired. The ceremony scene in the middle of the movie was memorable, it reminded me Rhapsody again and other than this, the only scene I found interesting and memorable was two walk separately in empty streets, neon lights on the buildings... I would want to learn more about the relationship of the couple, I would want to get to know them more. This is not a relationship movie, my big disappointment was partially because of this, I had expected a different, touching and deep relationship movie, but it was not. The movie doesn't focus on a certain theme and I couldn't decide whether the woman'a past was necessary or not? Because it changes everything. The love story isn't pretentious may be as the hype claims, but it is vapid and dull for sure (not like Fa Yeung Nin Wa) I am not a cinema historian, I am not a professional critic who feels obliged to be objective or I am not an audience who only considers technical aspects and cinematic breakthroughs and personally I look for emotion in movies and despite this film is considered to be one of the most romantic and poetic movies of all time, I couldn't find it.",

            "review_title": "Love Among Psychological Ruins",
            "content": "Director Alain Resnais' extremely matter-of-fact portrait of an adulterous, interracial relationship was considered frank to the point of shocking in 1959; today few will be even mildly startled. But while time has dimmed this aspect of the film, it has not dimmed the complex and very poetic nature of the film as a whole, and Hiroshima, MON AMOUR remains one of the finest examples of French \"New Wave\" cinema.The story itself is simple. An actress (Emmanuelle Riva) has come to Hiroshima to appear in an international film promoting peace. Two days before she is scheduled to return to France, she picks up a Japanse architect (Eiji Okada.) Instead of the casual sexual encounter they expect, the two find a profound physical and emotional passion. The depth of this passion leads Riva to make revelations about a tragic wartime romance--a revelation that leaves her emotionally fractured and vulnerable to Okada's demands that she remain in Hiroshima with him. The two are then faced with the choice of destroying their marriages by continuing the relationship or parting never to see each other again, with neither choice really desirable.A description of the storyline does not in any way describe what director Resnais does with it. The two leads are exceptional in their handling of the equally exceptional script, which presents us with a series of visual and verbal motifs (hair, hands, heads) that gradually acquire a poetic quality. The cinematography and editing manage to merge a documentary tone with a poetic lyricism. And much of the film's complexity lies in the way it treats the city of Hiroshima, which was destroyed by the atomic bomb and yet rebuilt itself; the city becomes a metaphor for the couple's relationship, the tragedies of passing time, the transient nature of memory, and everything that is both best and worst in human passion.Ultimately, Hiroshima, MON AMOUR does not present us with any easy answers, either about the couple its story presents or the nature of human passion in all its guises; it also requires full concentration, a certain degree of patience, and the ability to grasp metaphorical content. Because of this, I do not really recommend the film to a purely casual viewer--but those actively seeking a complex cinematic experience will find it makes a powerful, multi-layered statement, and for them I recommend it very highly indeed.Gary F.

Riva has the mature beauty characteristic of many European actresses and both she and Okada (who learned his French lines phonetically) are quite watchable. The scenes of the bombing and of the vast crowds congregating at the Genbaku Dome are uncredited material from Hideo Sekigawa's 'Hiroshima' (1953).

Yes, we are way more accustomed to non-linear storytelling and flashbacks, but the documentary elements, deemphasized plot and long sequences all push back against the norms of even the most \"modern\" of today's edgier films. What a way to put in motion the French New Wave.The story of two lovers reeling from their torrid extramarital affair put in the context of the bombing of Hiroshima just over a decade earlier creates an audacious juxtaposition of love and war and the way we ignore trauma or worse yet \u2013 suppress it. That Alain Resnais began the process of making this film as a documentary puts so much of it in perspective. The lengthy prologue combining eye-opening post-bomb footage with images of the lovers' passionate embraces set to Marguerite Duras' poetic voice-over dialogue is striking and unforgettable, if not disparate from the romantic drama that ensues. That this historical context doesn't engage with the rest of the story directly feels disappointing, but perhaps Resnais meant only to set a powerful tone. He wants to send the viewer into the bulk of the story aware of the history and feeling a certain melancholy \u2013 to just have it hang like a distant shadow over the rest of the film as an inescapable point of comparison.Most apparent is the way the heat of \"ten thousand suns\" leading to 200,000 dead and 80,000 injured puts into perspective the \"problem\" that her/elle (Emmanuelle Riva) and him/lui (Eiji Okada) are falling in love with each other but their time is coming to an end. Yet by the end of their long series of conversations, some deeper truths are revealed and the comparison does end up feeling remarkably less lofty by way of narrative optical illusion.At the center turns out to be Riva's character and performance. She is mesmerizing to watch and acts circles around her co-star (who isn't as developed as a character, though intentionally so it seems). Her performance is all the more special when you consider that all her most intense work comes in the form of recalling memories. If she can't drive the emotions of her character deeply into the heart of the audience, the entire film would feel disjointed and petty, especially given the Hiroshima comparison.Credit for Duras can't be undersold either; her literary background is apparent in the highly poetic narration and dialogue, adding a serious degree of prestige to the film. Her writing underpins virtually all the best moments of \"Hiroshima.\" Chiefly, it allows Resnais to make creative leaps with visuals, editing and structure. There is always this strong story for him to fall back on. All these elements combined make \"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" an arrestingly thought-provoking film. It has the kind of bones that could allow for remakes in any number of eras and contexts but also the flourishes that allow it to still feel edgy, even nearly 60 years later.~Steven CThanks for reading!",

However, unfortunately there are some factors which make this film look more dated than the other French New Wave landmarks, such as Breathless and The 400 Blows. One of those factors may be the acting style, which looks like one from the avant-garde theater.

It is hard to believe that this is the first film by Resnais, as it is filled with insight about the human condition. It also reveals the confidence of the young director, as the nonlinear stream of consciousness experienced by a pair of adulterous lovers can only retain interest if the imagery is superb. Despite its plot- less, \"arty\" feel, \"Hiroshima\" is very compelling.Set in the 1950s, Elle (Emmanuele Riva) is a French actress in town to make an anti-war film. She has met Lui (Eiji Okada), a Japanese architect who lost his entire family to the atomic bomb. The two are introduced to us naked and intertwined, and for several minutes we do not see their faces. During the opening sequence, she insists she experienced the aftermath of the Bomb, we see footage reenacting the horrors she is describing and he (correctly) tells her she was not there when it happened. One point that Elle stresses lingers: The Bomb brought the surface temperature of the Sun (10,000 degrees Fahrenheit) to the courtyard now named \"Peace Square\". Because of details like this, American audiences are not often reminded of what Hiroshima experienced on August 6, 1945. Liu, himself married, wants Elle to leave her French family behind and stay with him. While the two linger in public during early morning hours, he probes Elle for clues about her troubled past. Flashbacks reveal that Elle has never recovered from the death of her first lover, a German soldier. In the scenes where she meets the German for trysts, her face registers no indication that she comprehends why it is not proper to allow a member of an invading army to experience her feminine pleasures. She eventually suffers the same fate as other French collaborators; i.e., her hair is cut off and she is publicly shamed. Her parents also lock her up in the cellar for good measure. Losing her first love and being rejected by her entire community led the young woman to a nervous breakdown. More than a dozen years has gone by but Elle's mental stability is still diminished. Her madness draws Liu in; the more he learns the more attached he becomes.Some reviewers have expressed admiration with the juxtaposition of an attractive French actress coping with her own tragic past with the horrors of the atomic tragedy. It sure is a thought-provoking combination. Are Elle and Liu really stand-ins for Nevers, France and Hiroshima, Japan, respectively? Or are they both representing the opposite city? The premise (of the Marguerite Duras novel) encourages the audience to associate the cities with the lovers. However, it seems more fun to observe how often the storytellers make choices that do not serve the perspective of the \"never forget Hiroshima\" community. By cutting (or dissolving) away from the Hiroshima reenactments to the lovers going at it in a hotel room, the audience is being encouraged to detach emotionally from the anguished Japanese faces. By having a principal character who is mentally ill and falsely claims she personally witnessed the Bomb's aftermath, we detach even further from the central atrocity. This also is the effect of Liu providing very little information about his own family's destruction. While Resnais appears to hope the audience does not forget the Hiroshima blast, his leading characters invite the audience to let the history go. This is remarkably sophisticated storytelling.\"Hiroshima\" has masterful elements. Resnais is excellent with the Black and White imagery. He also draws inspiration from his cinematographers (Michio Takahashi for the bomb scenes and Sacha Vierny for the scenes in Nevers, France). The music by Georges Delerue and Giovanni Fusco is very jazzy and cool overall. The actors playing the lovers are very good, with Emmanuele Riva the standout. This film isn't for everyone, but I think the 90 minutes watching this hypnotic tone poem is wonderfully spent.Cinephiles know they can't miss this. Film buffs having their own adulterous affairs are encouraged to meet their current lover at the revival theater showing this excellent film. (Just make love somewhere else.)",

Maybe it's just me, but I think that the death and deformity of a couple hundred thousand Japanese civilians cannot be compared with the death of a woman's love (who himself was a Nazi) followed by her near insanity and banishment.  One is a global and cultural travesty while the other is personal.  Albeit the scale is different, both tragedies were equally traumatic to each.Visually, the film is phenomenal.  The naturalist lighting is great.  The neon lighting of the city coupled with the darkness creates a beauiful black and white frame.  The sound is also terrific.  There are moments when no background noise is present such as when the woman describes her tragic past to her lover.  This causes the audience to hang onto her every word.

They spend some of their time together walking the streets of Hiroshima and with their time running out they vow to remember each other by Hiroshima and Nevers respectively because their real names are never mentioned. This film begins very much like a documentary on Hiroshima but very quickly it turns into a character study focusing on ideas of love, memory, and personal identity. This film is more about art and expression and it uses quick flashbacks to replicate the past with voice-overs bringing the audience back to the present. That being said it should be treated as such because it truly is a masterpiece from Alain Resnais.",

            "content": "Hiroshima Mon Amour is an intensive \"conversation piece\" between two lovers who debate the meaning of memory, perception and existence. Hardly the stuff of a blockbuster, right? Another portion of the film recounts in a semi-documentary style the effects of the atomic bomb thrown over Hiroshima fourteen years before. A provocative clash of history and personal narrative, a refusal to offer a clear narrative meaning, an infusion of political dismay, an intense eroticism - all that was sensationally provocative and extremely modern by 1959, from the pioneering use of abrupt cuts and flashback to the abstractionism of the two lovers' bodies involved in ash/sand in the early scenes. Resnais's revolutionary technique makes good use of the camera's elegant visual fluidity and soundtrack. The protagonist's inner monologues sound formal and purposefully border on a superficial existentialist charm. This is an intense exercise in how cinema can be able to express a fleeting and abstract terrain like memory (almost completely virgin by 1959) in an intense way and using ingenious metaphors. It also evokes the terror of genocide and the threat of its oblivion by mankind. In a very pioneering way, the narrative is guided more by the protagonist's affections and emotions than by the logic of the traditional linear narrative. Resnais would radicalize his interest in memory years later with Last Year in Marienbad, when he also radicalized the aridity of his formal way of film construction to the detriment of traditional would-be narration. Hiroshima is a landmark by all means.",

What the movie attempts is laudable:  an exploration of the anguish the heart suffers in losing  a lover.. and somehow trying to connect it to the anguish of the survivors of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima... in a general mishmash way that life is. The movie however is not very aesthetically done. Right from the word go, you have the characters mouth out dramatic, poetic lines that seems completely out of place, unnatural. And Resnais tries to weave in imagery of Hiroshima's devastation in a rather corny way (like in the very beginning when the two lovers are tied together in one mass of flesh).\nMay be it just that I fail to appreciate the nuances of movies from this period, but I would warn you not to go to this with high expectations, as I did.",

            "content": "The first time I saw this film, I didn't give it nearly enough credit. I really loved the first 15 minutes, but largely tuned out for whatever reason quickly afterwards and wasn't able to get back into it. I chose to revisit it for this thread as I felt like I wasn't fair enough to it when I first watched it. Overall, I really loved it. It's full of a lot of great material, found in Resnais' fantastic direction and the complex romance between the two leads.As with my first viewing, Resnais' direction impressed me quite a lot. Topped with one of the most beautiful opening shots I've ever seen, the film often cuts between the present and the past, showing images which occur during and after the war. In spite of the occasional violent imagery in some of these scenes (I had to look away from the screen at a couple points), there's a strong sense of lyricism to this imagery, whether you're referring to the opening shots of a rebuilt Hiroshima with people walking through a museum made to commemorate the bombing of the city which seeps with emotion, Riva's flashbacks of a former lover which transitions from tenderness to a biting sense of loneliness within a single frame, or Riva's atmospheric flashbacks to when she was locked up in a cellar. Due to all of these scenes, it's easy to get lost in these aesthetics and swept up by the film. And these are deeply impressive aesthetics to get lost in, concerning the heavy subject of the film.I also really enjoyed the central romance between the two leads as it made for a compelling dynamic between the two of them. During an early scene, Riva says to Okada \"You're destroying me. You're good for me.\" I think this summarizes their relationship pretty well as two lovers who want to be together but can't. As the film progresses, its handling of their identity gets increasingly cloudy. Throughout several scenes of her discussing her past lover who was killed during the war, she begins to confuse Okada as her lover, oftentimes referring to him as such in several scenes such as their memorable exchange in the Tea Room. With these segments, we get a sense that she's still held prisoner by her wartime memories and maintaining her relationship with Okada will only exacerbate this problem. It's a really powerful dynamic. This culminates in their actions during the final 20 minutes which were a pretty decent way to end the film, even though this is the only portion where I think the film drags. While I wouldn't recommend cutting this portion out of the film, maybe trimming a couple of their encounters out of it would make it flow much smoother.The romance also works to establish metaphors for the post-war traumas which would've existed back then as, in addition to how Resnais occasionally undercuts their intimate moments (the opening shot, the time they spend together in bed), he also dehumanizes the two leads in a number of ways, which can be observed by how the two leads are referred to as \"She\" or \"He\" or with the famous final lines that raises a number of questions. Due to this, their romance feels rather abstract given the ambiguities which underlie it. While they both seem to represent the scars and traumas many people had during post-WW2 (European and Japanese trauma), could the two of them be symbolic of their countries or are their countries symbolic of them? That Riva confuses Okada as her lover can also be read as an attempt that many people would've made to cover their traumas by projecting an image over them in an attempt to overshadow them. These kinds of questions persist after the film ends given that it can be interpreted both ways.In conclusion, this is a really spectacular film that represents cinema at its most daring and beautiful. Regardless of what direction the last 20 minutes go in, the film which comes prior is wholly evocative and complex, overwhelmingly so at times. While several clips of disturbing war-time footage found at the beginning will keep some people from watching it, if you're able to get past that, you're in for a great treat with this one.",

            "content": "Resnais and Duras collaborate on this wonderful film, possibly the most interesting of the work of both artists.If Duras can be frankly indigestible in his literary and, especially, cinematographic work, here she gave us a magnificent and very simple story of sincere and honest melodrama, and with beautiful phrases mostly devoid of affectation (Rivas' voice, with its sweetness, an unforgettable simplicity and naturalness also helps...). Resnais, for his part, takes advantage of all the expressive potential of cinema (especially editing and framing) without giving us the feeling of being faced with a formalistic or self-indulgent experiment.There is a third contribution that is no less important: we cannot and do not want to imagine the film without the voice and face of Emmanuelle Rivas. And of course we cannot forget the extraordinary music by Giovanni Fusco (Delerue's supposed collaboration is reduced to the waltz heard in the bar), decisive in achieving the atmosphere and emotional impact of the film.The film is of an extraordinary formal brilliance, although in its last part it may have some moments in which the rhythm (paused by itself) declines and threatens to stagnate. After a pseudo-documentary beginning in which the loving encounter of a French actress and a Japanese diplomat breaks out with great sweetness in the period of peace and reconciliation after the Second World War, the film goes back to other loves of opposite sides between the young French woman and the invading German soldier during the German occupation of France.These long-repressed love affairs, resurrected by memory after several beers, narrated by Emmanuelle Rivas, Marguerite Duras and Alain Resnais in an unforgettable way, are the most emotional and painful part of the film.Later, during the second half of the film, only the emotional paralysis of the protagonist is shown, the inability and refusal to face life from oblivion and overcoming, or the need for that oblivion to continue as it is.A truly sentimental and political text at the same time, which begins with a beautiful metaphor of two embracing bodies recovering their vital pulse after a bath of ashes, and unfortunately ending with an affected dialogue with transcendental airs (in the case of Duras, not everything could be perfect). And a film that was the starting signal for the Nouvelle Vague in its most intellectual aspect.",

            "content": "In 1959, two films came out. They, along with Godard's \"Breathless\" a year later would define a movement called the French New Wave. They were Truffaut's \"The 400 blows\", and Resnais's \"Hiroshima mon amour\". While I found \"The 400 blows\" interesting and human, and \"Breathless \" unappealing and rough, I couldn't make up my mind about \"Hiroshima mon amour \". On the one hand, it was horrific, gory, nightmarish. On the other hand, it promoted the message of universal piece by showing this horror. I still remain ambivalent.Hiroshima, fourteen years after the Bomb. A bomb so powerful that if enough of them are dropped on Earth, it would cease to have life. Everything would perish under the white light of the explosion. Many films have examined this fear of extinction. This fear that was created because the bomb changed everything we knew about war, death,human history. It's the first weapon that can obliterate our planet completely. Japanese filmmakers have made works about Hiroshima, and the atomic bomb's destructive power, \"Godzilla\" -the original one- being one of them. It was only because of the atomic bomb testings the USA conducted at the time that it was promoted in there as an action movie, starting the franchise that continues to this day.But back to \"Hiroshima mon amour\". Two people meet in the fatal city; a man, Lui (Him), and a woman, Elle (Her). Her, an actress,comes to make a film about piece - in her words, what other film would be made in Hiroshima?-. Him, an architect, who was stationed in another part of Japan when the bomb fell, and was thus saved. Of death, of the social stigma attached to survivors, of mutations, of disease. She hasn't seen anything in Hiroshima, according to him. But she knows she has seen. The museum, with the photographs of the victims, the buildings destroyed, the documentaries showing mutated children. Whose fault was all that? Why would anyone do that? It's an event so significant that everyone remembers it, having lived it or not. Her and Him start a discussion about the nature of memory, their past loves, and above all, Hiroshima, this city frozen in one moment in time. Because, for all the modernization, people will always associate it with the Bomb that changed History.The music, haunting and slow-paced, transformed us to this tragic moment in time. Comprised entirely of orchestral pieces, its pace changed from slow to fast depending on the scene's subject. Such was its intensity that I was worried every time it accelerated for fear of seeing yet another image of a nuclear bomb survivor. Never again have I been so upset by a film score.Or rather, by what this film score was associated with. While the soundtrack was in itself quite upsetting considering its being like that of a horror picture, it was its combination with images of ineffable terror that rendered it so disturbing. This is the case of the sound needing the image to make an impact, or, it could be said, the one of the image dominating the screen because of its rawness, a rawness that the rather artificial film score - artificial since it is, after all, a product of composition, whilst Resnais's frightening sequence was a documentary, and it thus depicted reality - can't but play a more marginal role except if combined with the former.Resnais had a vision with this film; it was first intended as a documentary, similar to \"Nuit et brouillard\", the one he had made about the Holocaust three years ago. But the film was eventually changed to a work of fiction. His direction was representative of the New Wave, with many a jump cut, and honest portrayal of the topic. Resnais uses the technique of the flashback, jumping from Elle's past, to her romance in Hiroshima. The city itself exists both in the past and the present, simultaneously. The ruins of the buildings, destroyed by the bomb, the survivors, all serve as a reminder of Hiroshima's tragic past, but when juxtaposed with modern buildings, with the rebuilt part of the city, they seem as if belonging to a time now replaced by a glorious age of prosperity for the city. The future, and the past, the symbol of hope, and the one of tragedy, Hiroshima is all that.Emmanuelle Riva and Eiji Okada, acted as Elle and Lui in an intriguing way. Sometimes calm, others intense, their philosophical discussions replaced with acrimonious debates. Despite this existence of feeling, their performances mostly emphasize the role of the silence. There is a horrifying sequence, in which Elle describes with a shocking coldness, the effects of the bomb on the citizens of Hiroshima: \"The rain frightens\", she sais, \"The food frightens\". In another moment of the film, she recounts, with the same restricted emotions, that the sun was \"ten thousand degrees hot\", upon the explosion of the atomic bomb. Between all these phrases, Elle stops for some seconds, and remains silent. Is it for us to consider what she has just said, or for her to do so, not being able to cope with the sensitive topic? It could be both, or none of them. Regardless, the silence could also be a symbolism for the obliteration of Hiroshima. A city with no life, has no voice. It needs others to tell its story. Elle and Lui speak for those who can't, or who don't want to speak about their tragedy.The dialogues, what can I say about them? Written by famed author Marguerite Duras, they are interesting, deep sometimes, ordinary at other times. They examine memory, love, and the way the past can catch up to someone years after. Because Elle had lived her first great love fourteen years ago. With no one else than a German, during France's occupation, its most shameful period in modern History. The French humiliated her, shaved her hair, and locked her in a cellar when she cried out her lover's name. It's war that separates people based on their nationality. Elle shouldn't have loved someone from the opposite side. Why would Elle betray her country?\"Hiroshima mon amour\" is a film that will haunt me for years to come. I won't forget the images of people, forever scarred from the wounds the bomb left them. Was this fate deserving to them? This is a question that is still being debated, but Resnais with this film showed his disdain for the bombing, an action regarded by some as a crime against humanity and by others as necessary for the war to end.\"Hiroshima mon amour\" is a film that deals as much about piece as it does with memory. The fact that the bombing of Hiroshima is remembered by people that haven't lived it, its being an inspiration for films, shows its significance. But for these testimonies to be given, and the films to be made, peace had to prevail. The city had to be left in its haunting silence. A silence that the memories and the films would fill. Resnais's work certainly did so.",

            "review_title": "An Under-appreciated Masterpiece",
            "content": "Hiroshima Mon amour\"Why deny the obvious necessity of remembering,\" asks Emmanuelle Riva who plays the estranged actress in Alain Resnais' grave look at human relationships. She is talking about her own experience as a Frenchwoman involved romantically with a German officer during the war. Her humiliating punishment by her fellow countrymen after France was liberated drove her mad. Now, fourteen years later, she is in Hiroshima, Japan, an actress in a film about peace after the A-bomb. But her question is perhaps a personal acknowledgment of the difficulty coming to terms with the past, and understanding a post-Hiroshima world.Marguerite Duras has crafted a beautiful screenplay that shatters linear time and reality. Like William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury, Hiroshima progresses as a series of periodic flashbacks\u2014punctuation for the short, choppy sentences of the dialogue between Riva and Eiji Okada. He is Japanese. His one-night-stand with Riva's character lingers until the following night. The two are opposites: she is the Westerner, drawn to the grief of Hiroshima that also repels her. He is the \"foreigner\" (to non-Japanese audiences, anyway), seduced by her mysterious past and beauty.Resnais has an eye for human behavior, but also a respect for the world they inhabit. Hiroshima, whose total destruction is seen in some shots taken from documentaries, is eerily devoid of humans. It is a landscape reduced to ashes. Fourteen years later, the streets are long and empty; the museums, well-lit but vacant. In fact, Resnais does a particularly artful job of juxtaposing the in-your-face lovemaking scenes with gritty shots of the barren city. His cameras are always close, except when they are far away. Distance is a metaphor not only for love but also for time itself. In the present, the two lovers lie enmeshed in bed at the New Hiroshima Hotel. In Nevers, where Riva had the affair with the German soldier, we see sweeping shots of a girl riding her bike on a road and running through a meadow\u2014all from afar. It seems that time, as it passes, shrinks away into oblivion (l'oublie ) and risks being forgotten altogether.This is a film about love, not war. The instruments of war are viewed as awesome in might, but this thought is not the central theme of the film. In one scene, a parade of children carry signs decrying the nuclear arsenal. Scientific intelligence, we are told after the third sign written in French (owing to the Hiroshima's existence as a French-Japanese collaboration) that scientific intelligence is one-hundred times political intelligence. Though originally conceived as a one-hour documentary, Resnais in his own words said he used the Atomic bomb as a background element rather than the focus of Hiroshima. Riva's relationship, however, bears some of the same tendencies as the bomb itself. After the thrilling climax of the previous night, the two survivors are left to sort out the remaining bits and pieces. Like the fallout from the nuclear blast around them, the two must come to terms with their own pasts and agree on how to proceed. But while Riva tells her story of her folly with the German officer and subsequent public shaving of her head by Resistance fighters and her imprisonment in her cellar following Liberation, little of Eiji's character is revealed. Riva is recalcitrant when talking to Eiji, her eyes glaze over and she speaks to Eiji as if he were the officer. Escaped from her former life, she realizes she is doomed to repeat it until she comes to terms with it. They are both married, and this extramarital affair seems all-too-common for Riva's character, but something novel for Eiji's. He has a wife and two children, and perhaps does not normally condone such behavior. Maybe this rare foray explains his mildly obsessive feelings for Riva, whom he cannot bear to leave.How can we deal with the horrors of the past? In Hiroshima's case, it is by rebuilding and moving on. Life must continue. But for her, the unspeakable horror and suffering of the fallout from the bomb that she insists on having seen defies reasonable reaction. She can only cry, replaying the images in her head. We are left to conclude\u2014like her\u2014that the problems of the war are so vast, so heavy, that we must forget them or suffocate. Although she was not a witness, she insists that she saw the aftermath. Vision is an element of Resnais' lyrical cinematography: Riva loses her vision after her shaving, her eyes open but blank and soulless. To lose vision, one can only conclude, is to be devoid of love and humanness. Are we, at least in part, products of our environments? The two characters wake up in the New Hiroshima Hotel, a symbol of a rebuilt but not entirely healed city. Like citizens of the world, they must\u2014metaphysically, internally\u2014grapple with the awesome power of the Atomic bomb and the consequences of the Atomic age. No less importantly, they must come to terms with their past. At the end, she cannot help but visually flashback to Nevers. She is torn between the past and the present, between her first lover and current lover, her childhood and adulthood. Walking down a street lit by neon lights from shops and advertisements and pursued by Eiji, Riva's character is simultaneously repelled from and fascinated by this new world. Riva insists that she will stay with him, but then flirts with another man in a bar. And so the cycle begins again. The film the studios wanted and the film they got were starkly different. Resnais was hired to shoot an hour-long documentary, and the result is Hiroshima, an allegorical story that does not address the A-bomb head-on but rather discreetly. This ambiguity is perhaps more suitable\u2014and certainly more artistic\u2014by using story to convey horror and revulsion, love to express terror.

            "content": "Alain Resnais was really preoccupied with making people acknowledge and remember the terrors of war, as humanity tends to forget and repeats it over and over again. After making short documentaries (e.g. night and fog, recovering nazi film material so no one kept turning a blind eye to dimension what really happened) he decided to make something about Hiroshima but it was impossible to do a doc of something that he wasn't able to truly put in images, so in the end he wrote a love story of a french woman and a japanese that was in the middle of the war when everything happened. She keeps repeating that she knows about Hiroshima, he denies it \"You saw nothing in Hiroshima\". Algerian war was going on during Resnais' time, he was making a statement through his films, not to forget, to remember everything that went on and not to make the same mistakes. This is the constant dialog in the film which leaves us without knowing what will happen in the near future. The last scene of the couple is vague and without answers, just as we usually feel when we simply try to forget.",

Both leads are incredibly thoughtful, lovable, attractive, and their chemistry is intense. It's unlike any other new wave film I've seen and is many leagues ahead. This is pure art without being pretentious or boring.\nMost highly recommended and utterly surprising for me.",

            "content": "This movie is a great study into the intricacies of our attachment to those whom loved dearly, yet no longer exist. In a larger scope I see this movie as a poem. There is a certain flow in the movie that encapsulates the feeling of reading a good poem. The camera, acting, music, scene setup, and overall direction blend in seamlessly with each other. Not a moment do I feel like anything that occurs on screen, happens out of chance. All was planned deliberately and very carefully. Which I think makes this movie all the more bitter sweet.Albeit my main complain is that the movie was rather boring after the first hour mark but picks itself up again rather quickly, give or take 5 minutes. Otherwise, wonderful movie!",
