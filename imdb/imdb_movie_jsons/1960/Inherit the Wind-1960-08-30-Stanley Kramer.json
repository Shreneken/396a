            "content": "Like Elmer Gantry I first saw Inherit the Wind in the theater in Brooklyn when I was 13 years old. Both of those films dealt with issues arising from the Roaring Twenties out of religion. At the time I thought both were great dramatic pieces dealing with issues of the past. I thought how much we'd grown up as a country from 1925 to 1960.If you had told me that 46 years later we'd be fighting these same battles and that preachers had as much political power as they do I and many others would have said you were nuts. Yet here we are today in an age when Pat Robertson is taken as a serious political figure. Inherit the Wind is a dramatization of the famous Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925 when a biology teacher was arrested and challenged a law passed by the Tennessee State legislature making it a crime to teach anything other than the account of creation as set down in the Book of Genesis. Dick York is the biology teacher here, renamed Bertram Cates for the play and the film version of that play.In fact all the names of the dramatis personae of the Scopes Trial have been changed to allow some creativity by the authors Jerome Lawrence and Robert Lee. Spencer Tracy and Fredric March play fictionalizations of Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan named Henry Drummond and Matthew Harrison Brady respectively.Of course that is what Inherit the Wind is primarily known for, a duel of double Academy Award winners. In fact Spencer Tracy received another Academy Award nomination for this film, but lost to Burt Lancaster for Elmer Gantry. That's ironic to me because I thought March captured the essence of William Jennings Bryan better. Bryan is a man whose time has passed him by. But he's still a hero to the folks of small town rural America in the south and middle west. One thing to remember is that while Bryan was a great orator and advocate, he had not practiced law in over 30 years when he stepped into the courtroom for the trial. If he had been a better lawyer, he might not have fallen into the one big trap Tracy set for him and the trial and the attending publicity might have been better for his side.As good as Tracy is, the year before in Compulsion I think that Orson Welles captured the real Clarence Darrow in his character of Jonathan Wilk. No one in Hollywood could do long take speeches quite like Spencer Tracy though. I'm sure that's why Director Stanley Kramer hired him and they developed quite the screen partnership with Tracy doing four of his last five screen roles for Kramer. Stanley Kramer made some impeccable casting choices filling out the minor roles of the various townspeople of Hillsboro, Tennessee. There are two that I would single out. Claude Akins who usually played tough guys in various action films was astounding as the town preacher, the Reverend Jeremiah Brown. Sad to say there are still many like him out there. Akins's offbeat casting worked wonders, it turned out to be the high point of his screen career. On the opposite end of the spectrum was Noah Beery, Jr. who is a farmer and who's son was drowned some time before the events of the film. Beery is the town non-conformist, he refused to allow his son to be baptized and Akins has said the adolescent is in hell because of it.In a key scene when Tracy draws the ire of Judge Harry Morgan who sentences him to jail for contempt of court, Beery offers to put up his farm for collateral for Tracy's bail. Tracy's about to quit the case, but that simple gesture gives him hope, in the ultimate decency and clearheadedness of ordinary people. It's my favorite scene in Inherit the Wind.Stanley Kramer lived long enough to see this film become so relevant for today's times. I wonder what he must have thought.",

            "review_title": "a film (sadly) very relevant in current times, but also watchable for its towering stars",
            "content": "Sometimes a film becomes dated over time, that it lacks relevancy due to the way its filmed and its content. But in the case of Inherit the Wind, Stanley Kramer's production in terms of acting and staging is dated, but the themes are sadly still painfully relevant. Evolution vs. Creationism is still a hot button topic, though of course it shouldn't be (and the Supreme Court has ruled against Creationism as unconstitutional), but maybe even more shocking is to see the town of Hillsboro and how it could be like some small towns in America, mostly the South and the Midwest. One wonders if the mob could be as large and howling and fervent today as it was in Hillsboro (or how it was during the actual Scopes-Monkey trial in the 1920's).But what stays most passionate about the film, and also at its most flawed, is its conviction about the issue. Kramer is a right director for this material, if not the best. It's full of passionate speeches- it could also be said 'preachy' not too ironically enough in some scenes- and blazing courtroom scenes that are not very realistic (the way the lawyers speak and speechify to the jury and the people in the courtroom and, of course, the audience in the theater), but somehow they're highly enjoyable. This doesn't mean the writing in the film is always great, or all of the characters. But the film is compulsively watchable 'issue' film-making, self-important but full of poignant touches.The wisest choice that Kramer made, akin to what he did with The Defiant Ones, is put BIG actors in these BIG roles. Chiefly these are for Henry Drummond, the defense attorney played by Spencer Tracy, and the prosecutor Matt Brady played by Federic March (or rather, devoured by March). Like Frost/Nixon, the film becomes really as much about these two men, two old characters who have known each other over the years and have a real respect/hate relationship with one another (see the scene where they're on the rocking chairs to see their connection). So throughout the film, while the issue of evolution vs creationism is brought simmering to a boil, Tracy, a sensational actor, has to try to keep up with March who is so over the top that he cracks the ceiling with a sledgehammer.Best of all is to see their showdown when Drummond puts Brady on the stand, a theatrical gesture but in keeping with the fact of the case (William Jennings Bryant really was called to stand during his own trial), and in having these two actors yell and stare and make big gestures at each other. If nothing else, it's worth it to watch the film for these two, though I might consider Tracy the winner overall, while March gets points in individual scenes, like when he grandstands towards the end when the case is dismissed (also when he stands up for the girl Rachel Brown when she is \"damned\" by her father, but as a calculating move to get her on the stand).Which brings me to some of the flaws in the film. Kramer has a lot that he wants to say as a filmmaker, but he doesn't know how to tweak anything down past it being super theatrical. It would've helped, for example, to cut just a little of the dialog, some of the pompous exchanges between characters (albeit some of the dialog is actually pretty funny, mostly when Gene Kelly's reporter disses Brady). Another problem was Rachel Brown, who firstly is concocted as a contrivance (hey, let's make the daughter of the evangelical reverend also the fianc\u00e9 of the science teacher), but more-so that she's just a lame character, poorly written like many characters end up being in Kramer films, if not anywhere near as bad as the daughter in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. And the last little moment of the film, when Drummond puts together two specific books together, is a completely tasteless gesture, meant to appease both the believer and non-believer sect after what was a satisfactory ending between Tracy and Kelly where the former tells off the latter.But faults aside, the film does carry some legitimate power, and if nothing else I would watch it again just for the scenes between the two big stars. It's an actor's picture as much as a \"message\" picture, and as the themes carry some strong weight for discussion, not to mention the impressive semi-frightening sight of the Hillsboro religious mobs, it's really the actors who make it a (near) must-see.",

Were it not for the collision of Spencer Tracy and Frederick March this would be just an excellent Hollywood film instead of the classic that it is.I would be tempted to say that all you need is a basic knowledge of the plot and the ability to jump straight to the court room scenes, but that would be unfair. Watch the movie once  and then after that you can simply watch the fireworks.What can I say about the battle between Tracy and March? Nothing. Words fail me. This is one of the great battles on screen in any film. It should be seen by anyone who wants to see how \"easy\" acting should appear. All the more important is the fact that this is a battle of ideas that still matter today as much as then. If only all of the world's problem could be debated this perfectly we'd live in a happier place.See this movie.",

            "review_title": "A puff for a good film",
            "content": "It's a rare American film that takes the grand clash of ideas as almost its entire central subject matter, and Inherit The Wind has for that reason alone for long been a personal favourite. It's also a film that features some outstanding, larger than life acting, notably from the leads, whether it is Tracy, playing the crusty liberal for whom \"an idea is more important than a monument\" or the superb March, his performance full of facial tics and movement, and whose fundamentalist character does \"not think about what I do not think about.\" Director Kramer clearly places his sympathies in the former camp, although he does not bludgeon the audience with preconceptions. In fact as a filmmaker he had a reputation for making movies that held opinions and took stands, with a particular weakness for courtroom scenarios. Inherit The Wind came after the post-apocalyptic On The Beach, and just before the sombre Judgement At Nuremberg (also with Tracy). In the mid-1970s the director also made three 'judgement' films for TV based on other real trials.Whilst On The Beach offers a verdict of its own on humanity's military foolishness, and Judgement At Nuremberg is a just as sombre account of another judicial milestone of different significance, arguably Inherit The Wind falls neatly between the two in ways other than just the order of production. Like On The Beach, it makes its judgement too: not on a worldwide disaster visited by man upon himself, but on the perils of stifling free thought. And, as in Judgement At Nuremberg, it's a trial of ideas here too. But whereas the evil ideology of the Nazis ultimately brought millions to their deaths and stands condemned with its architects, it is enough in Hillsboro that \"That if you take a law like evolution and you make it a crime to teach it... tomorrow you may make it a crime to read about it. And soon you may ban books... because fanaticism and ignorance is forever busy, and needs feeding.\" In fact Tracy and March, with Kelly's able help, hold the centre stage for so much of the time that despite their best efforts the supporting cast seem a little enervated. The romantic subplot between Cates and his girlfriend (ostracised by her father for straying into the wrong camp) is occasionally a little cloying and, upon reflection is too much of a reflection from the main event. More damagingly, the character of the Rev. Jeremiah Brown, as portrayed by a miscast Claude Akins, is so fervent and cold hearted in the cause of the righteous that it occasionally wonders too close to self parody. An improvement to historical events is made by the introduction of a, for the most part, even-handed trial Judge Mel. It is he who provides an anchor for the audience in court as the two heavy weights slug it over points of order and procedural objections. Judge Mel also provides one of the trials more memorable, quiet moments when, just as it did in the real case, he finds the increasingly frustrated Drummond in contempt of court - only to see the fine which he levies paid for by the parents of a drowned child condemned by the fundamentalist lobby.In the light of today's religious debates in the US, Inherit The Wind seems braver than ever, and Tracy's character is allowed several hard hitting outbursts which, one wonders, would remain as so powerfully expressed if rewritten for a modern retelling. When he says, \"I don't swear for the hell of it. Language is a poor enough means of communication. We've got to use all the words we've got. Besides, there are damn few words anybody understands\" we all know what he means. And when he campaigns for a man to have the same right to think \"as a sponge\" it's a moment that remains starkly memorable. Curiously, a less emotional Darrow variant was essayed a year earlier by Orson Welles in Compulsion (1959), a version of another famous criminal trial. Inherit The Wind has been remade thrice more to good, but ultimately less memorable, effect (including once with Kirk Douglas) but the Kramer version remains ahead.Dramatic variances aside, inevitably any presentation of the Scopes trial, and such controversial material as it contains, will never please everyone. The source play upon which Kramer's film is based simplifies matters a little too readily and other criticisms can be made: for instance the original textbook from which the schoolteacher was convicted of teaching illegally evidently contained an advocacy of racist policies and eugenics unacceptable today while it also accepted the notorious Piltdown forgery as genuine proof of a 'missing link' and so on. Again, the relationship between Bryan and Darrow was more complicated in real life than the film has time or care to show - although ultimately one is so caught up in the fairground of judicial combat as the case progresses that one forgives such accommodations with the truth.Inherit The Wind stands badly in need of a decent special edition, a golden opportunity perhaps being offered by the widely followed 2005 debate that took place in Pennsylvania. The current disc offers little more than the film, although the widescreen presentation does justice to the splendid black-and-white cinematography of Ernest Laszlo, which effectively conveys the sweaty claustrophobia of small town, Bible-belt America. Whether or not the hesitation in bringing out such a potentially controversial, expanded package is a matter of intelligent design or just random selection, the public will have to judge for itself.",

            "content": "Top-notch courtroom drama set in 1925 upon Jerome Lawrence-Robert E. Lee 1955 play with nice script from Ned Young and Harold Smith . Dealing with a famous trial in Tennessee State : based on the 1925 scores Monkey Trial, in which a natural science teacher is arrreted and faced prosecution for lecturing on Darwinian theory in America Deep South . It happens a young schoolmaster, Dick York, was indicted for illegally teaching Charles Darwin's evolution theories. Then an agnostic, sympathetic Advocate at Law called Henry Drummond, Spencer Tracy, defends the hapless teacher against their rival antagonists , the conservative Fredric March, and a public prosecutor : Elliot Reid. While Dick York plays the ingenuous teacher and Gene Kelly bears inadequacy as the cynical reporter who lurks, danceless, in the sidelines and is comfortably denounced as the true villain of the piece. The familiar and notorious secondaries faces appearing are as follows : Gene Kelly who is rather let down by his miscast as a cunning journalist, Claude Akins as a stiff-upper-lip reverend who has a daughter : Donna Henderson, Dick York's girlfriend, the veteran Florence Eldridge, Noah Beery Jr, Ray Teal, Norman Fell, and Henry -Harry- Morgan as a judge. There is another rendition 1999, also based on the known incident, being directed by Daniel Petrie with George C Scott as rigid fundamentalist prosecutor who stubbornly prosecutes , Jack Lemmon as the atheist suplicator who defends , Tom Everett Scott as the accused of the crime of teaching evolution, Kathryn Morris, Piper Laurie, Lane Smith, John Cullum, Beau Bridges.\nThis is an excellent courtroom drama with hilarious elements , it is about the Monkey Trail that rocked America and in which Spencer Tracy gives a wonderful acting by repeating his usual style as the agnostic attorney who comes to town to defend an unfortunate teacher. Being a pretty good film, including debates direct and largely taken from the transcripts. Tolerably gripping in solid-fashioned, thanks chieftly to magnificent interpretation from a great main and support cast . The main stars steal the show by a thrilling confrontation that takes place between these giants of the cinema: Spencer Tracy and Fredric March. As veteran Fredric March is equally fabulous as the respected , ideologist Matthew Harrison who defends strictly the Biblic articles and attempts to keep religious teaching in the school.It contains an atmospheric and evocative cinematography by Ernest Laszlo. As well as adequate and exciting musical score by Ernest Gold. The motion picture was competently directed by Stanley Kramer. He was a prestigious writer, producer, director who made a lot of films. Here Kramer makes an attractive and enthralling show of coutroom fireworks. As Kramer directed films of all kinds of genres, such as : Not as a stranger, The pride and the passion, The defiant ones, On the beach, Judgement at Nuremberg, It's a mad, mad, mad world, Ship of fools, Guess who is coming to dinner, The secret of Santa Vittoria, Oklahoma crude, The domino principle, The runner stumbles.

            "content": "Too bad the battle over evolution still seethes in certain parts of the country, which means the movie still has topicality. This earnest version of the famous Scopes trial recounts that milestone event Stanley Kramer style, which means the message comes through loud and clear. It's an actor's hothouse, two hours of dialog with little action except for the marching mobs. Tracy wisely low-keys it much of the time while March, unfortunately, sometimes borders on loud-mouth parody. At the same time, Kelly manages the professional cynic in amiable style. And I really like York as the skinny, slightly befuddled teacher whose dedication to science in the classroom causes the big ruckus. Then there's the rather plain- faced Donna Anderson (Rachel) shrewdly cast as Cates' (York) girl friend, but more importantly, functions as the town's barometer of opinion.All in all, there's no doubt whose side the movie's on. At times the backwoods fundamentalists are near caricatures, aggressively smug in their trust in the Bible and loud rejection of science as to humanity's origin. But it's important to note that Drummond's (Tracy) basically arguing for freedom of thought and not atheism per-se. Doing the latter would, of course, have spelled box-office doom. Still, it was pretty gutsy of Kramer to take on biblical literalism, even in 1960. In fact, Drummond's religious views are never made clear, though Kramer has him add the Bible to Darwin's tome as the movie closes.I think it's fair to say that the movie takes a basically liberal position toward religion and reason, rejecting only that which cannot stand up to science. All in all, it's a histrionic powerhouse that at times fairly crackles with emotional give and take in an epic cultural clash.",

And that's the point.\" Based on a real-life case in 1925, two great lawyers argue the case for and against a science teacher accused of the crime of teaching evolution. Starring Dick York, Spencer Tracy and Gene Kelly.The people of Hillsboro were caught between (in their view) defending the Lord and saving face as the country ridiculed them. Popular opinion is a strong thing, but if you have a conviction, you should stand up for it. So I can understand both sides of the issue in that light.The film makes it seem as though the whole world accepts evolution aside from this small community, which is just not the case. Over fifty years later, a considerable percentage of the country accepts some version of creation. A newspaper making the bold pro-evolution claims that we see in this film, even if done today, would get some concerned letters. The Catholic Church may accept evolution as of the 1950s, but this does not mean the people in the pews do.Today we see some parallels with intelligent design. A pro-Darwin argument could be that all ideas should be presented, whether right or wrong, to let the students decide. Today, this is much the point of the intelligent design group. The difference is that Darwin is backed by science, of course. (I hesitate to go further for fear of offending anyone.) What a wonder about films with political messages is whether all the actors support the messages or simply accept the role as part of their job. It would certainly seem that to be part of a film means you endorse it, but I am unsure. Gary Cooper starred in \"High Noon\" while remaining anti-communist, so it is hard to say for certain where a job ends and a conviction begins.I do have to say the judge in the film is remarkably fair. One might expect him to naturally side with the people of Hillsboro, but he is pretty even-handed. He sustains objections that a more biased judge might let slide. I am impressed. The argument against the literal interpretation of the Bible is very well stated, and the judge probably should have stepped in at some point during this... it is quite the badgering of a witness, and of questionable relevancy. (Although, the prosecution at no time objected, so they are at fault, too.)",

It is the perfectly made film and should be held up to all as the pinnacle of film making.  It has the perfect director and the perfect actors.  It probably has the best behind-the-scenes crew ever assembled including the perfect film editor. The choice of black and white is also perfect.  This is one of those few gems where every element of film making came together to make the perfect movie.The story is very thought provoking from both points of view, the evolutionist and the fundamental Christian.  While I am not even close to being a Christian of any kind, I am haunted by the speech given by Matthew Harrison Brady that says how our children will turn into a godless mob with no direction without the teachings of the Bible (paraphrasing).  But, isn't that what has happened some 80+ years after the story takes place?  The actors effortlessly sell each character's point of view.There is very little that can be said about Spencer Tracy, Frederick March and Gene Kelly that hasn't already been said.  When you see the new version of this film, you can really understand why these actors are held in such high esteem.  These guys are actors!In short, this is one of the finest films ever made and should be seen by everyone.",

Looking at it from a northern suburb in the 1960s, it was a source of laughter. How could those bible-thumpers have been so ignorant as to have denied science? In 2007, when polls show that 40+ percent of Americans - not just small town Southerners, but Americans in general - believe the story of the creation of the world as told in Genesis, when state after state finds itself debating whether \"creationism\" should be taught along side science in public schools, Kramer's film is if anything more powerful and prophetic than when he first made it.

Religion, the Holocaust, slavery, racism...Kramer liked big topics. But like Edward Zwick and Steven Spielberg, Kramer had a tendency to tackle them in the most dumb ways possible, his \"serious topics\" often treated in a frivolous or condescending manner.And so \"Inherit the Wind\" revolves around lawyer Henry Drummond (played by Spencer Tracy), who travels to small town Tennessee in order to defend a schoolteacher arrested for teaching Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. His opponent? Fundamentalist Christian Leader Matthew Harrison Brady, who has the entire town on his side.The film features an iconic performance by Spencer Tracy and Kramer's direction is at times wonderful, but one can't escape how ridiculously heavy-handed this film is. Kramer portrays American Southerners as being universally stupid and lemming-like, bashes creationists, paints agnostics/atheists in a saintly light and demonizes everyone who believes in the Bible. This is bigotry in reverse, the film deliberately stacking the decks by giving all the well-argued points to the pro-evolutionists and portraying creationists as goofy mad men. There's no debate here \u2013 just smart people on one side and fools on the other.The irony is, in the real world, the case upon which this film was based only started because the American Civil Liberties Union were itching for a fight with the World's Christian Fundamentals Association. They encouraged the teacher to teach evolution and convinced local mining associations and politicians that the trial's publicity would be good for tourism. Throw in the fact that high profile lawyers like Clarence Darrow were only attracted to this case for the free publicity, and you had a huge circus which highlighted, not the greatness of Science over Religion, but the ugly similarities which bridged seemingly opposing ideologies.Ultimately, however, the truth of evolution is not the theme of \"Inherit the Wind\", but the \"right to think,\" and the \"right to question.\" What the film seeks ultimately to defend are the larger prerogatives of \"the broad, liberal, critical, cynical, sceptical, and tolerant mind.\" In other words, this is a remake of Sidney Lumet's \"12 Angry Men\", a far better courtroom movie.7.9/10 \u2013 Kramer's heavy-handed preaching is made tolerable by a powerhouse performance by the legendary Spencer Tracy. Less applicable to modern audiences are the film's critiques of McCarthyism. Throughout the film, Brady's bullying and anti-intellectualism conjure up images of US Sensator Joseph McCarthy, and by extension an American tendency towards a kind of populism/fascism that hammers people into silence and crushes individual thinking; the very atmosphere of fear that McCarthy's tactics and power generated.",

Only here it would be the Cates Monkey Trial since the names have been completely changed. So Spencer Tracy plays Henry Drummond instead of Clarence Darrow, Fredric March plays Matthew Harrison Brady instead of blow-hard populist Williams Jennings Bryant, York plays Bertram Cates instead of John Scopes - an earnest young man who wonders if this is all worth it, and Gene Kelly plays E. K. Hornbeck instead of H. L. Mencken, eating hot dogs and airing satirical pieces and just getting under Tracy's character's skin in general in an early non-musical role.I suppose most observers would say this film leans pretty left, and I'm not going to argue with that, but there's some effort to give the Fredric March character some dignity, like when he intervenes in Claude Aikens' let-'em-all-burn-in-hell diatribe and when he cuts off his own inquisition-like haranguing of Aikens' daughter after his wife calls out his name. And the movie hedges its bets a bit at the end by having Spencer Tracy revealed as \"the atheist who believes in God\" and the way he balances the Bible and the Darwin book as if they carry the exact same weight.Also, all that singing about old time religion at both the beginning and end. And Dick York declaring that what we're witnessing locally \"is not necessarily the Christian religion everywhere\". The filmmakers certainly didn't want to cause riots or alienate Christians to the point that they wouldn't buy a ticket. If it doesn't offend your sensibilities too much, it's a nice acting tour-de-force with Tracy and March going at it. Florence Eldridge, the actual Mrs. Fredric March, plays her own husband's character's wife and shines in the role.I'd recommend this one as it has the overall spirit of the actual Scopes Monkey trial down pretty pat, in spite of all of the subterfuges and renaming of characters.",

The Kelly character, based on H.L. Mencken, is strictly a device; and even if Mencken did speak in constant epigrams in real life (which I doubt), the actor oversells the character's cleverness. With all that taken into consideration, it's still a handsome and gripping courtroom drama. The First Amendment arguments were brave in the late-McCarthy era in which the play was written, and they may once again be pertinent in these one-nation-under-God days.

Let us come together in discussion without persecuting one another. Let's get along and find your own intellectual and spiritual path. You really must sit down with an open mind and watch this movie from the very beginning to know what the movie is about. This film, as I'm sure you are aware, was based on a play, which was in turn based on a real trial in the 1920s known as the Scopes Trial or 'The State of Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes'. In 1925, a high school teacher, John Scopes, was accused of violating Tennessee's Butler Act, which made it unlawful to teach human evolution in any state-funded school. He was put onto trial. In my opinion, I think he was frame. The trial was deliberately staged in order to attract publicity to the small town of Dayton, Tennessee, where it was held, and Scopes himself state out that he was unsure whether he had ever actually taught evolution. The trial served its purpose of drawing intense national publicity, as national reporters flocked to Dayton to cover the big-name lawyers who had agreed to represent each side. On one side was prosecution, William Jennings Bryan -time presidential candidate for the Democrats, and a devout Christian. Then on the defense was Clarence Darrow, a famed defense attorney that spoke for Scopes. The play Inherit the Wind (1955), by Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee, is loosely based on this trial. It turns Darrow and Bryan into characters named Henry Drummond and Matthew Brady. Other character were change as well in the movie version, as well as numerous changes in the plot. Directed by Stanley Kramer, the movie and play was written as a criticism of McCarthyism in the US. One of the playwrights himself said (and I'm paraphrasing) that the play wasn't about science Vs religion, it was about a man's right to think for himself. This movie respects both religion and science but makes the point that God put us on this earth to think and question. Evolution is the only legitimate theory that has been put forward by thinking people that explains HOW? It is the purpose of all world religions to try and explain WHY? I think many critics fail to see the point of the movie which is the right to think differently. Secular political correctness is no different than banning the teaching of evolution. In my opinion, this film is one of the finest pieces of cinema ever to see the screen. I've never encountered a movie so dense, so full of ideas, so laden with brilliant dialogue. Such strong characters, so much tension in the air you can almost touch it. Spencer Tracy is legendary as Henry Drummond. I love the speeches he made in the trial. Tracey does manage to look effortless. He really embodies the character, making it appear that he's doing very little when he's actually doing quite a lot. Fredric March starts as Matthew Brady. Fredric March is brilliant in the role. Dick York was well cast as Bertram Cates (John Scopes in real life) in this movie. He was a young and sensitive actor and you see this in all of his pre-Bewitched roles. Surprising, Gene Kelly as supporting character, reporter E. K. Hornbeck (H.L Mencken in real life) is giving some of the best lines in the film. It's rare to see Gene Kelly in some a dramatic role. I surprise he wasn't nominated. He made it work. I do like the music in the film. 'Gimme that old time religion', song fit the film so well. This was an eye-opener. The music was perfect. The final scene shows Drummond walking out of the court room alone with the song \"Battle Hymn Of The Republic\" being sung in the background is amazing. The film was later remake starring Jason Robards and Kirk Douglas aired in 1988. It was again remade in 1999, co-starring Jack Lemmon as Drummond and George C. Scott as Brady. I have yet to see those films, but it's worth checking out. I just wish they had accurate version of the Scopes Trial. The movie is a Hollywood Interpretation of the trial with 99% of that movie is completely opposite of what really happened in the trial. I would love to see a great documentary of it. Maybe one day. The biggest different was Brady. The real Bryan was far more sophisticated in his outlook than contemporary anti-Darwinist fundies- and he'd find the modern religious right as objectionable as his contemporary social Darwinists. Overall: It's a classic creative movie that will evolute over time, reaching new generations of people to look into the film and ask themselves, the big question. Where did we come from?

The film itself is taken from the actual 1925 Scope's Monkey Trial which is the factual record wherein the Theory of Evolution was put on trial.

The most interesting part of the film which is hailed by film historians, is the final courtroom confrontation. Tracy and March once friends are now battling in opposite ends of the legal issue. As a 'special' witness, March is hammered by the relentless Tracy who discovers that his life time friend does in fact have a fallibility after all.

Legal fights consume years from people's lives, deprive them of liberty, drain bank accounts and more. There are no winners (except the lawyers).People are supposed to comfort others and promote enlightenment, not fan the flames of fear and ignorance, and Inherit the Wind highlights this supposition. What a difference between seeing this as a teenager and seeing it again now. It affected me when I was younger, but it is not deep enough now, in many ways. The character of Rachel is compelling, but for some unexplained reason she disappears somewhere in the middle of the film. \"I was always more afraid of you\" she says of her father.

It's not that he doesn't believe, he's just giving a different view to the kids other than religion is the be all and end all of their world. Well, the town goes crazy and wants Bert to burn for his teachings, so two lawyers have been assigned to battle it out for the case of science vs. religion.The reason why this movie is so excellent isn't just the terrific acting, it's the story that a lot of people I'm sure could relate to one way or another.

            "content": "This film is based on a unique play - one of the few successful stage dramas based on actual dialog from a classic courtroom clash. The play, INHERIT THE WIND, was written by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee. Produced in the middle 1950s on Broadway, it starred Paul Muni as Henry Drummond, Ed Begley (Sr.) as Matthew Harrison Brady, and Tony Randall as E. J. Hornbeck. It has never stopped being one of the most revived of American plays, both on stage but also on the television screen (three times!) and once on film (the present subject of description). It is based on the trial, in Dayton, Tennessee, of the State of Tennessee v. John Scopes, which happened in 1925. Scopes had the temerity to break a current statute which made it illegal to teach Darwin's theory of Evolution in biology classes. The state legislature of Tennessee had passed the anti-evolution statute because the majority of the voters felt uncomfortable with Darwin's theory as opposed to the version of creation as found in Judeo-Christian scripture (in the book of Genessis).It was a bad period in America in much of the south and Midwest for unpopular foreign ideas and foreigners. It is no accident that the national argument against Darwin arose in the 1920s just as the Ku Klux Klan revitalized, grew to nearly 10 million members across the country, and captured several state legislatures (such as Indiana). Anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic, anti-Black, anti-Foreign, it was powerful in this period - a period that also saw Senator Hiram Johnson embracing bigotry and setting up those immigration quotas that helped doom so many Jews trying to flee Nazi Germany in the 1930s. So the anti-evolution law was a product of it's time.In the trial, Scopes was defended by Clarence Darrow. Darrow was normally a criminal trial attorney, but Scopes faced possible imprisonment under the law (the terms of punishment were vague). The prosecution was handled by three time Presidential candidate and former Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan. On the fringe as a reporter of the trial was the great cynic and words-smith H.L.Mencken, representing the Baltimore SUN.In the years since 1925 much legend has grown about this clash. In the present age, given the rise of the anti-Evolution movement to push \"Creationism\", what happened at the trial seems in vain. There is some truth to this, but there is some fiction. Creationism, in the modern age, is based on the same religious dislike Darwin's atheistic views, but it is embraced by many non-Christians as well as Christians in America. Also, it by-steps the problems of the original crusade by stressing that the schools teach Evolution as one of competing theories for the creation of life on earth. The trial was to show the problems of over-reliance by the right on the Bible, for Darrow (thwarted in bringing scientific information into the trial) cross-examined Bryan on the stand. Bryan (rather stupidly) agreed to this, and was shown to be remarkably close minded on scientific progress. But worse, he did show (to his followers) that he was willing to interpret the Bible and not accept everything literally. It was a shocker to his supporters in the country.The result was that Bryan won a Pyrrhic victory - Scopes was convicted. But publicity of how backward Tennessee looked made the state's leaders tell the judge to go easy on the punishment. Scopes was ordered to pay a small fine. It shattered the effect of the law. A week after the trial Bryan died in his sleep.Want of time prevents a full scale discussion of the case - there is evidence, for instance, that Scopes was asked by politicians to break the law as a test case. The textbook Scopes used had racist (anti-Black) ideas in it that were then perfectly acceptable in Darwinian circles in 1925. Bryan's slap at Darwinism was not totally without merit - a believer in Jeffersonian democracy all his career, he disliked the perverted form of the biological theory that was known as \"Social Darwinism\" pushed by eastern elitists to control the masses. In fact, Bryan planned to cross-examine Darrow on his explanation of this theory but was prevented by the Judge. Pity, it might have been interesting.Spencer Tracy and Frederick March are wonderful in their capturing Darrow and Bryan (here renamed Henry Drummond, after a 19th Century agnostic, and Matthew Harrison Brady, after the Civil War photographer). Their clash on screen is well worth seeing. So is Gene Kelly as Hornbeck/Mencken - a man in love with the language (\"Ah, Heavenly Hillborough\" he intones about the play's location), and with his anti-democratic cynicism that turns off Tracy at the end. Dick York as Cates/Scopes is properly stoic until he prevents Tracy from putting his girlfriend through a cross-examination after March tears her apart on the stand. Florence Eldritch (as Mrs. Brady) gives a fine performance as his most loyal and loving supporter (and one whose fears for him come true). Harry Morgan as the Judge, Claude Atkins as a rabid fundamentalist minister, and Noah Beery Jr. as a farmer who helps Tracy out for personal reasons are all fine too. A first rate film.",

The film pits two acting giants against one another for the only time in their illustrious careers: even if essentially understated, I think that Spencer Tracy delivers perhaps his greatest performance in this film (which deservedly earned him an Academy Award nomination) portraying famed lawyer Clarence Darrow \u0096 who was played by a burly Orson Welles a year earlier in COMPULSION (1959) - in all but name; Fredric March, who by this time had slipped into supporting roles, countered this with a showy (and necessarily hammy) portrayal of his flamboyant adversary, the true if misguided 'villain' of the piece \u0096 his flustered death scene is very moving and he managed to capture the character's every nuance perfectly, in my opinion; I would have liked to see the Academy recognize his contribution equally but at least he did win the coveted Best Actor Prize at the Berlin Film Festival! I have to wonder at this point whether the two actors ever threaded the subject of their respective DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE movies during shooting\u0085INHERIT THE WIND also features Gene Kelly's most satisfactory non-musical film performance as a cynical reporter, who is also an opportunist and something of a heel; it's interesting, too, that Kramer had just utilized Kelly's dancing 'rival' Fred Astaire in a straight role in his previous film, the excellent if depressing end-of-the-world opus ON THE BEACH (1959).By the way, Joe, I don't feel that Kramer intended to bash Christianity at all with this film: his main concern was freedom-of-speech which the teacher put under trial was prevented from exercising by the bigoted community, which in this case happened to be over-zealous practitioners of the Faith! Still, you shouldn't underestimate the implications of that final scene \u0096 the confrontation between Tracy and Kelly and its aftermath \u0096 where the agnostic lawyer's true (and, in retrospect, contradictory) beliefs come out into the open, and the harmonious co-existence of science and religion is entertained.",

A trial ensues, at which civil rights lawyer Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy) represents Cates, while Bible-thumper Matthew Harrison Brady (Fredric March) represents the state.What stuck in my mind as much as (if not more than) the trial was the revolting attitude of the townspeople: in one scene, they march through town carrying a burning effigy of Cates, singing about how they'll hang him. Once more, religion gone too far.I don't know exactly how accurate the movie is, but it still manages to show an important event in our nation's history.

Nor is it even in the IMDb Top 250. I find that really quite extraordinary, given the story on which it's based and the fascinating performances of the principals, Spencer Tracy and Fredric March. In particular, Henry Drummond's (Tracy) questioning of Matthew Brady (March) on the witness stand has got to be one of the finest oratories in the history of film. As I watched, I had to wonder how an actor, any actor could so convincingly remember and deliver all of that commentary without getting tripped up. I guess that's why Tracy's one of the best.I don't know a whole lot about the Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925 except by casual reference and this particular film. I do know it set the stage for a scientific and philosophical argument that persists to the present day. In everything I've ever read or heard about creationism versus evolution, I've never once heard mentioned an idea that I've come up with quite independently about the subject. I believe in God, but I also believe in the science of evolution; I don't find the two incompatible. My thinking is that it wouldn't be very clever or challenging for God to simply plop Adam and Eve on this place called Earth and simply let them go forth and multiply. The far greater trick would be for God to initiate a process we've come to call evolution, whereby lower life forms would gradually, over the span of millenia, develop into more advanced beings. Then, once having achieved status of Homo Sapiens, divergent races and religions would contest how they arrived here via a process of thinking, a by-product of free will. I think this is a much more marvelous way of looking at Man and humanity, with faith and science both seeking knowledge hand in hand.This is all probably a little too heavy to get into in a movie review, but it's what's at the heart of the Bert Cates (Dick York) defense - \"the only man in town who thinks at all and he's in jail.\" The picture poses this dichotomy quite well, with an entire town virtually one sided in it's belief that evolution is a heresy. What I found interesting is that Drummond and Brady, and particularly Brady's wife Sarah (Florence Eldridge), could set aside their professional differences to be genuinely good friends outside the courtroom.In short, this one's a keeper. Tracy and March are at the top of their game and are fascinating characters to watch, in and out of their courtroom scenes. Lending support in a rare dramatic role is Gene Kelly who surprised me with his able portrayal of a Baltimore newspaperman. Considering his importance to the story, the character of school teacher Cates doesn't get a lot of screen time, although the strained relationship with his fianc\u00e9e Rachel Brown (Donna Anderson) is dealt with over the course of the story with it's impact on Miss Brown's father, a hell-fire preacher convincingly portrayed by Claude Akins.",

            "content": "When I was a kid, I loved \"Inherit the Wind\" so much that I had much of the dialogue memorized. Viewing it as an adult, I am horrified. This movie, oh so heavy-handedly, brainwashed me, and countless other viewers, into bigotry and lies. \"Inherit the Wind\" hates. It wants you to hate. In that, it is in the same category as, though less toxic than, propaganda films like \"The Eternal Jew.\" To be clear: I'm a Northern liberal, I learned evolution in Catholic school, and I never had any reason to doubt Darwin's theory. I love old movies, and have eagerly followed Frederic March from \"Death Takes a Holiday\" to \"Best Years of Our Lives\" to this. In short, I might have continued to love this movie.There's a lot in \"Inherit the Wind\" to love -- or, rather, to seduce.Gene Kelly is E.K. Hornbeck, a character based on journalist H.L. Mencken. Hornbeck delivers one lapidary, laugh-out-loud jibe after another. Kelly's feet don't dance, but his tongue does, and impressively, Kelly was never smoother or sexier. His quick wit penetrates clods' phony piety; he's a hero with only his tongue as a weapon; you want to be like him.Spencer Tracy is monumental; he took a break from posing as the fifth face on Mount Rushmore (and getting drunk and cheating on his wife) to pontificate as Henry Drummond, a character based on Clarence Darrow. Tracy's Drummond is integrity's last, best hope against a world of small-town, Southern, Christian, ignorance and malice.Frederic March as Matthew Harrison Brady, based on William Jennings Bryan, depicts Tracy's opponent as a fat, befuddled, self-deluded old man.Overall, \"Inherit the Wind\" depicts the battle of light -- Northerners, atheists, and white collar types -- against the forces of darkness -- Southerners, Christians, and too many blue collars or rednecks.Thank God, or H.L. Mencken, I've grown up a lot since I first saw, and loved, this movie.There are two problems here: the movie is a pack of twisted lies. There is a very good site devoted to debunking this movie; it's called \"The Monkey Trial.\" Point by point, and with quotes and full citations, the site goes through the film's many lies, and history's truths.HL Mencken was a bigot; his real comments about the South, not to mention African Americans and Jews, are atrocious.William Jennings Bryan was one of America's greatest orators, not the befuddled dunce Frederick March portrays in this film. WJB was a champion of the working man; see the 2006 WJB biography by Michael Kazin. This biography points out that WJB electrified the masses with his speeches, helped make FDR's New Deal possible, and fought against Social Darwinism, the truly evil application of Darwin's theories to elitist, classist, racist, anti-immigrant, eugenic purposes.The entire plot of the movie is nonsense; the Monkey Trial was a publicity stunt hosted by the town itself.So, given that \"Inherit the Wind\" is a pack of lies, what *is* its underlying logic? Its underlying logic is hate, pure and simple. Christians: BAD BAD BAD!!! Southerners: BAD BAD BAD!!! Working people, or, as Mencken labeled them, \"peasants\": EW! Atheists: GOOD. Our Best hope.When it comes to movies like this, we don't need to try to imagine what it was like to live under Stalinist regimes. We Americans were subject to brainwashing ourselves.",

I recently viewed this film on TCM, I couldn't help but come to the conclusion that the film is a well crafted and entertaining bit of propaganda. This film is a thinly disguised reenact ion of the Scopes \"Monkey\" trial. For the record, the defendant, a teacher who believed in Darwinism was convicted for teaching a concept that was against the prevailing law at the time. In the real trial, Spencer Tracy played Clarence Darrow, and Frederick March played William Jennings Bryan. For the record, Mr. Bryan was a three time nominee of the Democratic Party for President. In his time, he was considered a great progressive who represented the common man, particularly the people who worked in the farms and factories. For some, his only fault was that he was a devout Christian who believed, as most people in his time believed, that the Bible was the highest authority.Clarence Darrow was one of the most famous lawyers in the country, who also took on cases that represented the common man. He was also the man who defended two very rich children who on a whim of arrogance killed a child. It was one of Darrow's last cases, and in my mind, blemished his otherwise noble career. He did it for money, not for any altruistic purpose that was a hallmark of his career. He was also a \"devout\" atheist.The problem I have with the overriding theme of this film is its portrayal of bigotry and ignorance. Bigotry and ignorance is not limited to people who lived in the \"bible belt\". For every instance of defects in those people in those times we have the example of intolerant people using Darwinism and \"survival of the fittest\" as building blocks of the totalitarian political parties that made the 20th Century the bloodiest yet.Darwin's theory of evolution was incorrectly popularized into the \"survival of the fitness.\" which replaced religion as the foundation of the totalitarian political parties such as Communism, Nazism and Fascism. The people who held these new views of society misused Darwinism in the same fashion that many misused Christian beliefs. This film seems tainted by an obvious \"we know, you don't know\" bias that is no different than those who thought that the Nazi's had all the answers to the problems of mankind. This film seems to be an odd and unfair way of condemning bigotry by portraying those who believed in the old Christian beliefs as oafs, and those who believed in Darwin as enlightened and likable characters. This is not art, this is propaganda. I give the movie 9 out of 10 because it has taken me years to see the film as propaganda.",

            "review_title": "A good movie that hedges its bets",
            "content": "\"Inherit the Wind\" makes for an undeniably good watch. Its inspiration, the Scopes Trial of 1925, holds inherent fascination and (depressingly) ongoing relevance, as evidenced by the recent battle in Dover. Two great actors, Spencer Tracy and Fredric March, get to play parts bursting with juice in the tastiest of dramatic settings, a courtroom. Even mediocre courtroom dramas are usually watchable -- trials are instant theater -- but the Scopes Trial was heaven-sent for a scenarist: crackling dialogue, charged issues, and a pair of titans at the center. Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan were both masterful performers, two real-life one-man shows. No playwright could hope to invent better.But the script hedges its bets. The hit stage play that spawned the film nominally fictionalized the story and the characters to avoid the necessity of absolute historical accuracy, and that's fine. Dramatic compression and embellishment are the norm even without the veneer of fiction. But here we have a case of both too much and not enough, and the result distorts not just the facts but the social issues at stake.Henry Drummond (the Darrow character) and Matthew Brady (Bryan) aren't exactly impenetrably disguised. \u0010 Ditto E. W. Hornbeck (played by Gene Kelly), a famous, cynical Baltimore journalist who arrives to kibitz and mock the proceedings... well exactly how many famous cynical Baltimore journalists are there? The script freely appropriates biographical details, trial tidbits (like the squabble over Brady's \"colonel\" title), and whole chunks of dialogue straight from the court transcript. Yet frustratingly the screenwriters can't leave well enough alone.The real John Scopes was approached by a group of local citizens eager to get Dayton, TN on the national radar. He agreed to be a test case to allow the ACLU to challenge the state's statutory ban on teaching evolution. The ban was hardly a hot-button issue; it was being quietly ignored by teachers and indeed by the legislature itself. The text that Scopes taught was not only already in use but in fact required by state law.But the movie takes the popcorn route: the teacher Gates (Dick York) is a lone crusader for truth, while the townspeople are a monolithic fundamentalist entity, all but gnashing their teeth in eagerness for a lynching. Worse, the script invents a fianc\u00e9e for Gates, and -- gasp! -- she's the daughter of the fiery town minister! It's enough to make you groan. The dramatic signposting in these scenes is so obvious that it amounts to an insult. We KNOW the issue is divisive; there's all those people yelling. The subplot's too heavy-handed to be poignant so you just sit through it and wait for Tracy and March to show up again.The resolution (following a terrific and reasonably accurate witness box showdown) similarly feels forced and false, as does the final scene between Drummond and Hornbeck/Mencken (which feels like a writer's afterthought to \"balance the message\"). Kelly has a natural big-city dash that is quite effective in the role -- dapper and graceful, he shows up like a neon sign in the rural setting. A local woman asks him if he needs \"a nice clean place to stay.\" He doffs his boater, smiles sweetly, and replies, \"I had a nice clean place to stay, ma'am, but I left it to come here.\" It's funny, and fleetingly you can imagine what the movie might have been like with somebody like Preston Sturges in charge to seize on the satirical possibilities of the events. But the authors and\u00a0director Stanley Kramer are too well-intentioned to empathize with the H. L. Menckens of the world, so Hornbeck's snarky cynicism earns him an inevitable condemnation as well. (Stanley Kramer may never have had a bad intention in his life. He was the anti-John Waters.)So we're here to be taught a lesson about bigotry, ignorance, and the sacredness of truth. Yet the truth gets compromised, a baffling choice when the reality contains enough drama for five movies. \u0010At one point Brady, cornered by Drummond, announces: \"I do not think about things I don't think about.\" Drummond returns, \"Do you think about things you \u0010DO think about?\", to which the flustered Brady blurts, \"Well, sometimes.\" The lines have a classic screenwriter's ring, too good to be true -- and they come verbatim from Darrow and Bryan. With material like that, who needs fiction?",

            "content": "The 1960s are often seen as a decade of great social change, both in the film industry and elsewhere, and it is notable that the opening year of that decade saw two major films, \"Inherit the Wind\" and \"Elmer Gantry\", which took a critical look at religion, a subject which filmmakers had previously been obliged to treat in a respectful manner.In Charles Darwin's native Britain the religious controversy which his evolutionary theories provoked when first published largely died away during his lifetime; when he died in 1882 the Church granted him the honour of burial in Westminster Abbey. Not so in America, where forty years after his death the creation/evolution issue was still the subject of furious debate in religious circles. In 1925 Tennessee passed a state law that prohibited the teaching of evolution in public schools, and a young teacher named John Scopes was put on trial for breaching that law. \"Inherit the Wind\" (based on an earlier play of the same name) is a fictionalised account of what became known as the \"Monkey Trial\". The title comes from the Book of Proverbs: \"He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind\".All the leading figures in the trial are fictionalised. The characters Matthew Harrison Brady, Henry Drummond and Bertram Cates correspond to the historical figures of William Jennings Bryan (prosecutor), Clarence Darrow (Counsel for the defence) and Scopes. The town of Dayton, where the trial occurred, is here named \"Hillsboro\". There are also some invented characters, such as the Reverend Jeremiah Brown, whose bigotry and fanaticism shock even Brady, and his daughter Rachel, who also happens to be Cates's girlfriend.The makers of \"Inherit the Wind\", like the original playwrights Jerome Lawrence and Robert Lee, were probably less interested in the creation/evolution debate itself than they were in using the Monkey Trial as a warning against intolerance and as a metaphor for McCarthyism. The film often departs from the historical facts of the trial, and generally does so in order to further this agenda. Cates is portrayed as the victim of unjust persecution, whereas in reality Scopes, who was a sports coach rather than a science teacher, was persuaded to volunteer for the role of defendant by the ACLU, which wanted to test the constitutionality of the state law, and by a group of Dayton businessmen who hoped that the publicity generated by the trial would boost the local economy. The people of Hillsboro are portrayed (with only a few exceptions) as hostile, hate-filled bigots, at one stage even threatening to lynch Cates and Drummond. In reality, even Darrow paid tribute to the courteous reception he was afforded by the citizens of Dayton.The film plays down the fact that Bryan, far from being part of what today would be called the \"Religious Right\", was actually part of the Religious Left, holding progressive social views which he saw as being based on Christian teaching. His opposition to Darwin was not only theological; he also disliked the way in which evolutionary theory, under the guise of \"Social Darwinism\", was being used to justify eugenics and laissez-faire capitalism. It also plays down the fact that H.L. Mencken, upon whom the journalist E.K. Hornbeck is based, was something of a reactionary who despised democracy and later became an apologist for Hitler.Another playwright of this period, Arthur Miller, also used historical events, in his case the Salem Witch Trials, to draw parallels with McCarthyism. I sometimes find myself in disagreement with Miller's political views, including his views on McCarthyism, but I am nevertheless a great admirer of his \"The Crucible\", one of the most powerful theatrical dramas of the twentieth century. Similarly, I find that there is much to admire in \"Inherit the Wind\", despite its occasionally tendentious political stance, largely because of the power and sincerity of the acting. Cates (played by Dick York, best known as Darrin Stephens in \"Bewitched\") is a relatively minor figure; the main emphasis is on the courtroom clashes between Drummond and Brady. They are played by two great veterans, Spencer Tracy and Fredric March. March's Brady is sincerely devout but blinkered and narrow-minded; he is dangerous not because he is a wicked man but because he is so certain of the rightness of his ideas that he is unable to tolerate opposition to them. Tracy plays Drummond as a rather gruff liberal; the previous year Orson Welles had, in \"Compulsion\", played a similar character also based upon Darrow. Like the historical Darrow, Drummond is an agnostic, but his main concern is not to attack religion but to oppose bigotry and to uphold freedom of speech. It is only when the judge refuses to let him question the constitutionality of the law or to call expert evidence on evolutionary biology that he resorts to cross-examining Brady on inconsistencies in the Bible.The third main character is Hornbeck, a non-singing, non-dancing role for Gene Kelly. He is nominally on the same side as Drummond, but the two eventually fall out. The liberal Drummond dislikes what he sees as Hornbeck's unprincipled cynicism and there is also a hint that the atheist Hornbeck is just as prejudiced and self-righteous as Brady. There is also a good performance from Claude Akins as Reverend Brown.The Cold War is now over and McCarthy is, for most people, just a name in the history books. The revival of the creationist controversy (which had died down somewhat by 1960) in recent years, however, means that the film has now taken on a greater literal significance than it had when first made. Millions of Americans (and quite a few people elsewhere) now believe that the Genesis account of creation is literally true and that it, and not the scientifically accepted theory of evolution, should be taught in schools. The views expressed by Spencer Tracy in this film still need to be heard in defence of science, reason and intellectual freedom against latter-day Matthew Bradys. 8/10",

            "content": "This is truly one of the greatest films (and Tracy's best performance) ever made because it does not shy away from three main points: 1) Freedom of speech is a right to express the ideas held in your mind regardless what others believe and 2) In the face of 'new facts', the responsible person must be willing to change their minds or at least let others hold their own views without being persecuted and 3) Any idea, however seemingly rational and/or noble can be taken to dangerous, unjust, self-serving and disconnected extremes bringing great harms in the name of such 'ideas'.Too often, inherently good ideas or discoveries are co-opted by the power hungry who mangle and misrepresent them in order to push their agenda onto a fearful and ignorant populous. In this film, we see the population of a 'God-fearing' southern town being whipped up into a frenzy over the inflaming and inciting rhetoric of the town preacher who's authority (and the town's way of life) is threatened by 'new ideas' regarding the origin of man. In very UN-Godly fashion, the preacher goes to extremes to keep this new thinking out of his town. At one point the 'God-fearing' population gathers to chant 'death to the teacher' of Darwin's ideas while he is behind bars. Not a very Godly way of behaving.However, as the film progresses, views are changed and moderation prevails albeit at the cost of the preacher's power and pride. People who are fixed in their views and unwilling to listen to others and even demonize others for expressing different beliefs are often driven to extremes to defend those views because it is often easier to fight for your beliefs (even if they are IL-informed) rather than to change your beliefs (even when those new beliefs are objectively more appropriate).Just as 'Creationism' can be the foundation for misguided and dangerous fervor, so can Darwinism. After all, it was Darwin's Origin of Man that provided Hitler with the rational for his 'Superman' race of which he would be the master. In his view, Hitler was just 'helping along' the natural evolution of man through his extermination of 'the weak' so that the master race could flourish more quickly. This extreme and notorious use of Darwin's theory was not taken into account in the film. In the end, the film leads the viewer to believe that Darwin's theory is true and benign while Religion produces dangerous whackos. Both ideas (and all their variations and permutations) can be co-opted by radicals as tools for their own advancement.Inherit the Wind is a great film and provides a cautionary lesson about the dangers of allowing beliefs (one way or the other) to go to extremes.",

            "content": "Although Fredric March and Spencer Tracy had been acting in films for some time before Inherit the Wind, each turns in such a masterly performance here, it is as if they were inventing acting from scratch. These men ARE Brady and Drummond, by the end of the film they are as familiar to us as if we met them on the street. Kramer's direction is understated and let's the language of the play itself propel the movie forward; and a powerful play it is, part historical retrospect, part philosophical confrontation.A note on the historical and legal problems with which the play deals. A couple of reviewers complain about some historical inaccuracy, and apparently there's even a fundamentalist web-site set up to 'debunk' the film.This is a film, based on a play, and hence a work of fiction. It is thus not required to present the Scopes trial with historical accuracy. The play did draw not only on the newspaper accounts of the Scopes trial, but much of the trial dialog is in fact lifted from court records - which are still available in some libraries, and in public records. Yet the purpose of the play, and thus the movie, is dramatic, not journalistic.It is notable that one such reviewer claimed the 'evidence' presented by Drummond was discredited - demonstrating that he had not seen the movie, since Drummond is not allowed to present evidence, but merely ask questions of Brady that Brady can not answer.The legal issues of the play may also be obscured in our culturally regressive era, when so few Americans understand their own Constitutional government and its justice system. Although at issue is a State law applied in a local court, both Drummond and the judge (masterfully played by Henry Morgan in his finest supporting performance) understand what the prosecutors, including Brady, choose to ignore - since the ultimate issue is a matter of Constitutional law, failure before the jury (which is inevitable) is not the end but the beginning - Drummond is merely playing the first move in a game of repeated appeals ultimately leading to the Supreme Court. He would certainly have preferred placing scientific testimony into the record at the start, but he settles for Brady's incoherent religious fanaticism, since what is at issue is the separation of church and state. Religion cannot be allowed to determine law - or education - in a pluralistic society because religious faith is incoherent as social policy, and frequently in conflict with opposing interpretations.Oh, by the way, the best evidence for evolution happens to be genetic mutation, not dinosaur fossils. But fossils now really have this importance: if the carbon dating of fossils is ineffective, then obviously radioactivity is ineffective, and nuclear power never happened.It is sad that children like Brady - or Palin or Robertson, et al - choose to befuddle their followers (just for the sake of their own aggrandizement) into believing they live in an era before technology and science effectively reinforce each other. It remains a curiosity that supposed 'Christians' continue to speak falsehoods while practicing some weird paganism masquerading as \"literal word of God.\" Can God's \"day\" be 12 million human years long? Isn't it disrespectful to God to assume otherwise? Augustine said God is outside of any time at all, thus such measure is irrelevant to his being; Ambrose thought it possible that God regenerated the universe in its entirety every moment, making such measure irrelevant to our being. If it matters to a scientist for the sake of greater investigation, discovery, invention, then let us travel that road, since such concerns God only insofar as he loves us and these benefit us - if He fears such discoveries, or would deny us such benefit, \"then he is not God, and we have nothing to fear\" (as the hero of Scott's \"Kingdom of Heaven\" remarks).The theory of evolution was among the theories that medical scientists were able to use to develop such benefits as penicillin and the polio vaccine. Those unwilling to live with Darwin are free to abjure these benefits as well. But they are NOT free to deny these benefits to me or my family - including the benefit of a good secular education with scientific (not spuriously 'religious')foundations.The teaching of evolution in publicly funded schools is Constitutional; the teaching of Creationism, or other religious credo, is not. Those unhappy with that may withdraw their children into private church-sponsored schools where they can be kept ignorant as rocks.Following the State Supreme Court's attempt to preserve the law while remarking it as 'poorly written,' and overturning Scopes' conviction, the ultimate result of the Scopes trial on which this film is based, was for the law to be repealed by the state legislature as unenforcible.\"The first major court battle over evolution in the federal courts was decided in 1968, when the United States Supreme Court ruled in Epperson v. Arkansas that a state statute prohibiting the teaching of evolution was unconstitutional because it catered to a religious doctrine, thereby violating the establishment clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution.\" From www.tungate.com/evolution_court_cases.htm",

            "content": "Many people today confuse religion or faith with pure fundamentalism, including the literal interpretation of the Bible, which is only one kind of religion. For viewers who are closely paying attention to the very perceptive script of this film, a clear distinction is made between those who believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible and those who espouse other spiritual convictions that are just as deep and significant. This difference is as important today as it was in 1960 when the film was made. As the character of Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy) illustrates, faith and science need not contradict each other. They can in fact compliment each other. With every scientific development there arises another set of unanswered questions. It is the confirmed cynic, reporter E.K. Hornbeck (Gene Kelly), who denies faith itself, and he does not prevail at the end of the movie as the wise words and character of Drummond do.Other reviewers have criticized the exaggerated theatrics in the courtroom, specifically the performance of Frederic March as an overly zealous Matthew Brady, the creationist orator whose character is patterned from the real William Jennings Bryan. Without the added drama, the courtroom scenes, based on the actual and very technical Scopes trial of 1925, would never maintain the interest of most viewers, and Stanley Kramer was more aware of this than anyone. As to March's interpretation of the role of such a bombastic figure, as it was written, I wouldn't change a thing. I have seen March in a variety of roles, and he is among the best that Hollywood has to offer, including his performance here.Considering her excellent work and the prominence that her part plays in the movie, I was surprised that Florence Eldridge, who was the real spouse of Frederic March, received such low billing on all of the credit listings that I have seen. As was the case in \"On the Beach\", which was also directed by Kramer, Donna Anderson ably plays the role of a very troubled woman who finds herself in the midst of circumstances beyond her control. While other reviewers can only accept Gene Kelly as a dancer and a singer, his excellent portrayal as a sneering skeptic reveals a side to him that I had never seen before.As to further criticism of the expansion and embellishment of the actual Scopes story by the writers, this work is defined from the start as fiction based on a true story. As is the case with all fiction based on a true story, it is to be taken as such. Again, the actual Scopes trial, especially its technicalities, would not have met very much success as a movie. This is art and needs to be accepted as such.While I very much disliked the opening song \"Old Time Religion\" and believe that there are at least a dozen, very inspiring gospel songs that could have taken its place, Kramer's deliberate intention may have been to displease viewers by it. If so, it worked for me. The closing \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\", handled beautifully by Leslie Uggams, who also sang the opening tune, was far more appealing to the ear and did get the final word in the end.The entire circus atmosphere that surrounds such a serious trial, by itself, serves as proof that the human race hasn't evolved very much. For me, this is among the most meaningful statements of the film.",

When the two men come down to their final showdown and the barrier of dogma is breached, it is a triumphant moment for human dignity--and for Mr. Tracy and Mr. March.\" YOU BET. If you want to see the zenith in the field of acting,be it on the stage or screen, then seeing Fredric March and Spencer Tracy \"go at it,\" is your bag. I sat GLUED before that TV screen for the entire 2:00. The most amazing thing about the film is its timeliness because in many instances, here in 2007,we are still annoyed by those who think they are God's lawyers or spokesmen, providing of course there is a God. I would assume so but I couldn't place my hand on a bible and swear to it.Oh what Charles Darwin did to us all with his \"Origin of Species.\" One man came along and opened, much to the chagrin of bible thumpers, the idea of the evolution of man from lower species, then to simians and down from trees we came. Once upon a time in 1925 Tennessee, a teacher named Scopes had the audacity to question creation in front of his students and it ended up as \"The Monkey Trial\"---a war between celebrity barristers Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan played by Spencer Tracy and Fredrich March respectively. Mind you, the film is BASED on that trial and was never meant to be an accurate portrayal of it.In today's America, are not Presidents chosen due to religious sentiments of the voting constituency instead of solely on their ability? Of course it's true so have we Americans ever awakened 80+ years after that Scopes trial? Hardly. Has not the RELIGIOUS issue of abort or not to abort taken over the Republican Party? In 1925, Darrow asked what happened to the idea of separation of church and state. That question is still being asked now. Why can't we get the religious \"monkey\" off our backs and learn to keep God in houses of worship instead of in houses of Congress? Put on the TV and watch for yourselves all these bible thumpers who know it all and hello? We are back to Fredric March playing W.J.Bryan in \"Inherit the Wind.\" The concept of God is so beautiful but organized religion can be so ugly,intellectually constricting and prejudicial to the concept of brotherhood, it detracts from the very concept of a Creator which is the exact opposite of its purpose. \"Inherit the Wind\" is certainly a masterful film and is for any THINKING person. It's for anyone who appreciates a film that makes one think instead of simply munching on popcorn. It's a \"horizon broadening\" motion picture, totally captivating, intriguing and powerful. Rent it or watch it on TCM. You'll never regret it.",

            "content": "Ever since Charles Darwin published his \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859, which established evolution by common descent as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature, fierce debate has raged on the validity of his evolutionary theories, and their effect upon religious doctrine. Fortunately, given the research of Darwin and Wallace, as well as Mendel's studies of genetic inheritance \u0096 not to mention a host of equally-important scientists who followed \u0096 evolution is now almost universally accepted as a proved scientific theory. However, back in 1925, a considerable proportion of intelligent and educated individuals simply refused to believe that man and ape had descended from a common ancestor, and many people's complete reliance on the Bible implied that any conflicting theories must certainly be incorrect and, needless to say, blasphemous. At this time, the Tennessee legislature passed a law that forbade the teaching, in state-funded schools, of \"any theory that denies the story of the Divine Creation of man as taught in the Bible, and to teach instead that man has descended from a lower order of animals.\" A young teacher, John Scopes, was charged with this precise crime, and the ensuing court case is often known as the \"Scopes Monkey Trial.\"In 1955, Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee first adapted the trial into a fictionalised play, which was successful enough to spawn a Hollywood film version in 1960, directed by noted \"message movie\" director Stanley Kramer. There are few genres more exciting than a well-made courtroom drama, a melting-pot for sudden revelations, flaring tempers and impassioned monologues. Though perhaps lacking the sense of realism apparent in other similar pictures, such as '12 Angry Men (1957)' and 'The Verdict (1982),' Kramer's film is both an important and entertaining film, maturely approaching the roots of the Creation-Evolution debate and offering a perspective that certainly skews towards Darwinism, but is never anti-religion {in fact, the play was originally intended as a critique of Macarthyism}. The main acting performances are assuredly phenomenal, employing an impeccable selection of cinema's most seasoned performers: Spencer Tracy plays the honest and likable Henry Drummond, defending lawyer of the accused man, whose laid-back, profanity-laden demeanour in court suggests world-weariness rather than impertinence. Fredric March is the celebrated religious advocate Matthew Harrison Brady, whose sterling reputation earns him a rousing welcome to the small town, but has his success swung the worship from the Lord to himself?The biggest surprise of the film comes from Gene Kelly, who completely abandons all notions of being a musical performer. As controversial journalist E. K. Hornbeck, Kelly is hilariously smug and sarcastic, regularly uttering succinct and scathing witticisms that often leave his subjects shocked and offended. Though he's undoubtedly not a very nice person to know, and admits to having a lonely existence, his eventual response to Drummond's accusations proves one of the film's more memorable lines: \"You'll be there. You're the type. Who else would defend my right to be lonely?\" The superb, multi-faceted characterisations of each of the main characters is ultimately what makes 'Inherit the Wind' so admirable, with both Drummond and Brady revealing truths about themselves that we never would have expected. An interesting dimension to Tracy's character is that he is revealed to be a quietly-religious man, placing his faith in both the Holy Bible and the teachings of science. After all, Drummond isn't at all refuting the validity of religion in a person's life, but is merely arguing that every man has the right to think for himself, to strive to understand the glorious world that he inhabits, whether he believes God to have created it or not.",

Under the able hands of Stanley Kramer, INHERIT THE WIND sets two Hollywood titans (Mr. Tracy and Mr. March, both two-times Oscar recipients) against each other in their friend-and-foe collision in this sweat box courtroom drama. Sometimes, one has to see it to believe (although paradoxically, cinema is an art-form of illusion in its nexus) that, barely one century ago, humanity has once descended onto a level so hidebound and fanatically idiotic, and it is not a beauteous sight at any rate (unnervingly relevant to today's milieu, one has a fair reason to be vigilant that a giant and similar regression might be right in the offing). To a liberal mind, why \"the right to think\" needs to be pointed up in a legal court is beyond belief, and one's mild contempt cannot be mitigated by Kramer's rip-snorting deployment aiming to heighten religious bigotry and hostility: whether it is that poignant chanting of OLD TIME RELIGION by an uncredited Leslie Uggams opens the film, or a grand pageantry to glad-hand Matthew Harrison Brady (March), a beloved statesman and the standard-bearer of biblical piety, to join the prosecution team; or the appended fictitious story between Rev. Brown (an imposingly conflicted Claude Akins) and his daughter Rachel (an equally conflicted and tormented Donna Anderson), who is the fianc\u00e9e of the defendant; or the townsfolk's relentless marching demonstration of baying for blood, all of which ultimately render the ending a shade anticlimactic. Henry Drummond (Tracy), Mr. Brady's arch enemy in the regard of religious fervor, comes to the aid of the ill-fated defendant Bertram Cates (a callow but unshrinking, martyrdom-seeking Dick York), along with a cynical newspaperman E. K. Hornbeck (a boater clad Kelly, blithely shooting sideswipes with his scarcely tapped straight-facedness) to warrant a national coverage of this hot debate. Needless to say, the meat of the film is the verbal face-off, Mr. March (won a Silver Berlin Bear for his grandiose hyperbole but snubbed in the Oscar race), firstly comes off as a vainglorious dogmatist, repugnant prima facie, but significantly blunts our antipathy through the scenes with Ms. Brody (played by his real-life wife Florence Eldridge, graced with a hallmark of sensibility and empathy), Mr. Brody is nothing less than a buffoon blinkered by a misinterpreted belief to a point, after his feet of clay is disclosed, he is summarily deserted by his followers, and when his cant- ridden peroration sounds his death knell precipitated by his undue gluttony, there is pathos oozing. Mr. Tracy, chalked up his 7th Oscar nomination out of an aggregate of 9, is indisputably at his best whenever he gushes with meticulous long-takes (as in other two Tracy-Kramer collaborations: JUDGEMENT AT NUREMBERG 1961 and GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER 1967), potently elicits searing emotion with immaculate immediacy but also conspicuously serves justice to the script's dialectics, and what can one say? Just watch and wait to be awestruck. A quintessential pedagogic lesson about human and humanity, INHERIT THE WIND should be promulgated as an elementary school staple for every pupil to acquire how to accept and embrace inclusivity and individuality among others, maybe, that is the cure for massive cock-ups scouring our present universe.",

Just a few months ago, I came across a Bengali movie called \"A Holy Conspiracy.\" In the name of God, I swear I did not know that it was a remake of Stanley Kramer's \"Inherit The Wind.\" Why did it take us Indians so long to remake it? Was it the fear of God or people who hail as almighty? We are stunned by satirical fiction pieces like \"OMG\" (2012) and \"PK\" (2014), then just think about the 1925 \"Scopes Money Trial,\" which happened in real life. Watching this film in 2023 gives me an unpleasant trauma of human conscience and how it has evolved over the years. Or it hasn't evolved enough in many parts yet? What if some people in some remote villages still don't believe in Darwin's theories? Inherit The Wind is about the argument between what the Bible says and what Darwin tried to prove, but it's in courtroom this time. A religious town fires a schoolteacher for teaching scientific theories in school that may disturb their faith in God. Two lawyers, with two different perspectives, argue about whether he is guilty or not. The trial puts the human conscience in a coma. It also questions our belief in God, or, better yet, the people who think they are the Messiahs of God, and the scientific achievements of those intellectual minds created by God himself. The cobweb also has a political agenda. Now you know how crazily intelligent a script this was. And what a powerful cast it had. Spencer Tracy and Gene Kelly both did tremendously well here, but what a juggernaut Fredric March was! The heat was visible because of him, and he was damn too hot to handle even though he was on the antagonizer's side.

It became known as The Monkey Trial, and here we get the film version of that trial, cobbling together bits from the transcript of the trial and using dialogue taken from the play by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E Lee. Inherit The Wind perfectly captures the stupidity of that court case, excellently photographed by Ernest Laszlo, and directed with aplomb by Stanley Kramer {to me a career high}, it ultimately climbs thru the roof of greatness on account of two blunderbuss performances from Spencer Tracy & Fredric March as Drummond and Brady respectively. Anyone proclaiming these two performances as overacting should quite frankly be punched repeatedly in the face, for it's a lesson in emotional driven acting of the highest order. Bolstering the show is Gene Kelly offering slimy comic relief out in the wings, Harry Morgan as the judge caught between the two balls of fury, and a smashing little turn from Fredric March's real life wife Florence Eldridge, as ironically, Brady's erstwhile spouse.Inherit The Wind was nominated for four Academy Awards, not winning any in what was a great year for cinema, but really it doesn't matter because the film stands up even today as a monument of great acting and a lesson in just how skew whiff things can get in the name of tired old beliefs and religion gone berserker.

Now, we have the Kansas state board of education excluding evolution from public school science classrooms.  So then Stanley Kramer's movie was a futuristic film in an early 20th Century setting.  Considering his film was made during the communist witch hunting McCarthy era, and now Evil-utionists (using Matthew Harrison Brady's pronunciation) are in season, INHERIT THE WIND is even politically relevant (I almost wrote \"correct\" but today that word has lost its meaning) today.  Now, I am a medical school professor who purchased two video cassettes of this movie right here.  I can't stop watching this movie because the excellence of the acting and filmmaking is timelessly exciting. I certainly encourage all of my students and children to see this film for two reasons.  The script provides a balanced insight into the personal issues associated with conflicts between scientific and religious (fundamentalist? extremist?) viewpoints;  and also these are, even now, contemporary issues playing out in the theopolitical system that American democracy has become.

The movie version is respectful to its source, and I'm not sure why. As a play it wasn't much, and as a movie it is, well, not dull as dishwater but dreadfully mediocre, trying awfully hard to please everyone in the audience at once. Why try to please everyone,--or even anyone? Why not just make a good movie and let the chips fall where they may? As most people know the play and film were about the famous Tennessee 'monkey trial' in the twenties, when the forces of Good (the Bible thumpers) and the voice of Darwin (the pointy-headed intellctuals and city folk) came to blows in a small court-house. The former were represented by former presidential candidate and national icon William Jennings Bryan, while the latter were served by famous trial lawyer Clarence Darrow. The issue was whether a high school teacher could intruct his pupils in the theory of evolution. A heated and bitter debate ensued between these two aging titans, and though he won, Bryan left courtroom a broken man and died shortly thereafter. The movie highlights the trial, and is at its best during the the exchanges between the Darrow and Bryan characters (the names were changed for legal reasons). Stanley Kramer produced and directed the film and is to blame for its poor quality. Kramer was in his heyday a daring producer, but never much of a director, and in this film his flaws are glaringly apparent. He has no feeling for the camera, no editing sense, he doesn't know how to build tension, has no sense of time or place, and he is blind to nuance and subtlety. This film is incredibly flat and obvious, and it's as preachy as old Bryan himself out on the Chatauqua circuit, though it offers a more 'enlightened' and 'thoughtful' viewpoint. Essentially one watches the film to see Bryan go down, just as in old-time melodramas one wanted to see the snarling villain get his just desserts, as they used to say. The acting is mostly pedestrian and uninteresting, and a lot of key supporting roles are weirdly miscast. Spencer Tracy performance as the Darrow character, though, is quite good, rising above both the script and the director's too-indulgent handling of his star. Tracy really rallied for this late entry in his canon, and while he's a far cry from the charming rogue he was twenty or thirty years earlier, he's still as charismatic as ever, always commanding and deserving of respect. Fredric March is a disaster as Bryan, and I wondered when watching his god-awful, hammy performance why he was ever thought of as a good let alone great actor. March is a Western Union actor, telegraphing and underlining each response to the action. His double-takes and the gurgling noises he frequently deploys are meant to indicate a.) confusion, and b.) insecurity. I found myeslf continually talking to him, saying things like, \"Yes, Freddie old boy, we got it the first time\". The same should have been said to Stanley Kramer when the film was being made, \"Okay, Stan, I understand. We have to learn to trust one another and respect our differences\". But in 1960, when the film was made, Hollywood was getting quite serious, even solemn about certain topics, tolerance being one of them. Inherit the Wind was a harbinger of the sort of movie soon to come,--To Kill a Mockingbird, Fail-Safe, The Best Man, The Birdman Of Alcatraz--and as such isn't even a very good example of its type, as unlike it successor films it has neither wit or even the faux-Bohemianism of these loping dinosaurs of the New Frontier and Great Society.",

It makes no claim for historical accuracy, so it changes the names of all the principal characters but follows the broad outlines of the historical trial. The actual trial reflected the conflict between Protestant fundamentalism and Protestant modernism that was reaching a crescendo and has still not disappeared.Bertram Cates/John Scopes (Dick York) is a high school teacher charged with teaching the theory of evolution in violation of a new Tennessee law passed earlier in the year. His fiancee, Rachel Brown (Donna Anderson), is the daughter of Rev. Jeremiah Brown (Claude Akins), a fundamentalist preacher who leads the local charge against Cates/Scopes.The whole trial is a setup to test the Tennessee law and is supported by the liberal press, including the Baltimore Herald/Baltimore Sun and its star journalist E. K. Hornbeck/H. L. Mencken (Gene Kelly). Hornbeck becomes a gadfly around the rigorous fundamentalist town of Hillsboro.The prosecution brings in a former presidential candidate to argue its case. This is Matthew Harrison Brady/William Jennings Bryan (Fredric March). The defense brings in its own star lawyer, Henry Drummond/Clarence Darrow (Spencer Tracy). The two are old friends but are diametrically opposed on the matter of intellectual freedom. Brady/Bryan is a staunch fundamentalist who takes a literal view of the scriptural text, including the creation account in Genesis. Drummond/Darrow is a religious agnostic for whom the right to pursue truth with intellectual freedom is paramount. The judge, Merle Coffey/John T. Raulston (Harry Morgan), tilts towards the prosecution but tries to keep a balanced hand.The film exaggerates the conflict within the town. It lays out the sides of the argument in the repartee between Brady/Bryan and Drummond/Darrow that would never actually be permitted in an actual trial. The trial concludes more-or-less as the actual 1925 did.If one sees the movie as a metaphor, it's a fascinating effort to explore intellectual freedom through a screenplay. But, as history, it strays far from reality. There were many more lawyers involved in the case, in addition to Darrow and Bryan. Scopes was understood by everyone to be a cipher standing in for the legal argument and never spent any time in jail. Scopes had no fiancee at the time. He was not teaching from a book by Charles Darwin. Bryan died five days after the trial ended, not on the dramatic last day.",

Scopes, a teacher from Tennessee, was caught spreading the theory of evolution in his classroom. He was taken to court and prosecuted by the highly-respected William Jennings Bryan, an ex-Presidential candidate and popular religious figure, renowned for his fundamentalist views of the Bible.In an astonishing turn of events, defense attorney Clarence Darrow called Bryan to the stand during the trial and quizzed him on Biblical literalism. It set back fundamentalism for a few years as Bryan walked away looking the fool. However, in my opinion - after reading transcripts - the entire process was a bit unfair, as were some of the accusations brought forth by Darrow, whose sole purpose was to gain a reaction out of Bryan by mocking his religious beliefs. Prosecution still won the case, however, since Scopes was on trial for teaching evolution - and in the end, the fact was that he did.In the film, which is loosely based on the actual events of the Scopes Monkey Trial, Spencer Tracey plays Darrow in the form of Henry Drummond, an educated man who thinks fundamentalism is a joke. Matthew Harrison Brady (Fredric March)is based on William Jennings Bryan.Stanley Kramer's direction is excellent, the b&w photography is superb and the performances are great. However, my only problem with this film is that it clearly has an agenda - to make a mockery of fundamentalism, Bryan and the entire trial. A LOT of facts are fooled around with - Tracey's character is turned into a smart, educated guy and Brady (played by March) is a gluttonous, prejudiced redneck. Tracey gets all the good lines in the script, making March's character look like an utter imbecile - and a thoroughly despicable character.The real trial wasn't quite so one-sided. Although Bryan was certainly left looking worse off between the two of them, the trial never become so heated nor was it as smooth and clever on Darrow's behalf as it is for Tracey in the film. (I'm particularly speaking about the climax of the film.) It's an early case of Hollywood taking \"creative liberties\" - it is a very, very good film; but it's also kind of hard to ignore the blatant bias of the movie. It's not that I am offended by the film because I am a Christian zealot or whatever else other criticizers of this aspect of the film have been called - I just don't like ANY religious group, or historical figures, made out to look like fools when in reality it wasn't exactly so convenient.Other than a few minor quibbles about historical accuracies, \"Inherit the Wind\" is a great film.

As a film buff the most entertaining thing for me to watch is a great story with great actors giving great performances as they battle against one another. A lot of times courtroom dramas are some of the best examples of this and that holds true here with this masterpiece, which to me is one of the greatest movies ever made. Quite often when I'm asked about some of the greatest performances in history both Tracy and March, from this movie, jump right to my mind. The two men were certainly towards the end of their careers and were already legends by the time this film went into production but I'm really not sure if either one had been better. With so many great performances behind them it's hard to narrow their best down to one but their work here could certainly be debated as their greatest. It's really amazing to see how much life, energy and raw power they bring their characters and watching them battle against one another just leaves me in amazement. Tracy's stern, straight forward performance mixes so well with March's hyped but sometimes comical performance that you can't help but marvel as the brilliance in front of you. I'm not sure if the two men spoke before the big courtroom scene at the end of the movie but it certainly feels like they're both hitting the right notes as they battle back and forth trying to get their feelings across. Kelly is just as impressive in his role and adds a nice comic touch that the film certainly needs. Kelly is very impressive from start to finish as is York as the teacher, Donna Anderson as his girl and Claude Akins as her preacher father. A lot of people bash this movie for being anti-religion but I don't think that's the case at all. I think the movie is about the right to think no matter if you think religion is right or if Darwin was right. I've read that the religious folks here are all crazy or shown in a bad light. Again, I'd disagree by saying fanatics are shown in a bad light or people who don't want others to think on their own are shown in a bad light. To me Kramer is one of the most under appreciated directors out there. Yes, he was respected for bringing certain moral films to the screen but I don't think he ever got the credit for how great many of his movies were. There are hundreds if not thousands of courtroom dramas out there but this here is certainly one of the best and Tracy and March make this film one of the all-time greats.",

Okay, okay I get the point that suppressing free thought in defense of orthodoxy is bad, just stop beating me over the head with it. Inherit the Wind is neither subtle nor complex - it is essentially a propaganda film (as others have noted), albeit one whose point of view most people would agree with.\nWith the exception of the enjoyably smarmy Gene Kelly as journalist EK Hornbeck, I found the over-acting by the lead players tiresome. The writing too seemed quite poor. As an exposition of the issues at stake, the court room arguments were completely garbled. Either attorney would be hard-pressed to win a high school debate, let alone a high profile court case. Defense attorney Henry Drummond's private reasons for supporting his client (and the moral of the story) are particularly wishy-washy. Rather than supporting the teaching of evolution on the grounds that it is the best-substantiated hypothesis while creationism is demonstrably false, he instead defends it on the basis that minority thoughts and viewpoints should be freely expressed. Unfortunately, the logical implication of this line of argument is that, in the current day and age, when evolutionary theory is universally accepted, any biology teacher who wanted to teach the minority view of creationism should be allowed to do so. The film's biggest sin, however, is its lack of courage towards the end. [Possible spoiler ahead] Rather than fully developing the idea of the moral culpability of the citizens of Hillsboro, this film ends up focusing all the blame on the intellectual arrogance of a single man, the prosecuting attorney, Matthew Brady. What a cop out! This movie just didn't have the guts to come out explicitly with the conclusion that the biggest villains were the southern voters who elected those supporting this silly legislation.",

I'd seen it a few times before giving it to my brother as a gift, and by that time, the entire family enjoyed watching it. The first time I showed it to my mom, she asked thirty minutes in, \"When's Fredric March going to show up?\" \"He's right there,\" I answered, pointing to the only man on the screen. \"But where's Fredric March?\" she asked again. As familiar as she was with his work, she still didn't recognize him in this movie. Not only is his face unrecognizable, but his accent and manner of speaking is completely different than how he's ever talked in any other movie. Now here's the punchline: he wasn't nominated for an Oscar that year. Fredric March's performance in Inherit the Wind is not only one of the greatest Oscar snubs of all time, it's one of the greatest screen performances of all time. It's absolutely impossible when you watch this movie to accept the fact that Fredric March didn't win an Oscar, let alone wasn't even nominated. Inherit the Wind is a fictionalized recounting of the Scopes Monkey Trial, and almost the entire film takes place in the courtroom, with Spencer Tracy and Fredric March butting heads. Spencer Tracy's part could have been played by anyone. It's by far the easier role to play; he may have passionate speeches to deliver, but he doesn't have to build a complex, layered character whose convictions are just as important as his public image. Spence doesn't even do a particularly good job delivering his passionate speeches; as usual, it seems like he had a cold and the best he could do was remember his lines and say them somewhat intelligibly. Freddie is incredible. Freddie is the reason to watch the movie, and there's a good chance you won't even recognize him!In case you're not familiar with the Scopes trial, this is a movie that debates the legality of teaching evolution in the classroom. Dick York plays the teacher who dared to go against the community's beliefs, Donna Anderson plays Dick's weak girlfriend torn between him and her father, the minister, and Gene Kelly plays the cynical reporter on the sidelines. Obviously, I highly recommend this movie, but if the subject matter is off-putting, you probably won't like it. To me, this is a wonderfully entertaining classic that's just as enjoyable the first, second, and tenth time I watch it. As soon as Leslie Uggams sings \"Gimme Dat Old Time Religion\" in the opening credits, I know I'm in for two hours of chilling goosebumps, masterfully directed by Stanley Kramer.",

It is like Orwell's 1984, or Fahrenheit 451: the story of a society that tries to repress free thought.That alone would make it a powerful story, but it is the way Kramer put it together that makes it the masterpiece that it is. What struck me this time was his use of hymns and some of the crowd scenes, which truly portray this small town world as one capable of violence and hatred, of completely irrational lack of thought, in a chilling way. Yes, when the preacher damns his own daughter to hell chills go down your spine. But so many of the scenes are so effective.Supporting this masterful direction is brilliant screen dialogue. Some of the speeches accorded the two stars are as fine as anything in any movie I have seen.And then there is the acting of Frederic March and Spencer Tracy.

They think the theory that mankind is derived from a creature so primitive as a monkey is an insult. In one scene, a carnie tries to introduce the idea of \"devolution.\" He explains that the backward, beady-eyed animal was actually de-evolved from man as punishment from God.Part of the appeal of creationism is the belief that man exists for a divine purpose. God went out of his way to create mankind - in His own image, no less - to carry out His will. Science, however, explains that unfortunately man doesn't exist for a reason, nor does any other type of life. We exist today simply because some monkeys millions of years ago hooked up. One can understand why a creationist would be so upset by this concept.And yet, the Hillsboro townsfolk's argument against evolution is that they are \"simple\" people who don't need science complicating everything. If man was really so divine, so above the animal kingdom, wouldn't he be open to expanding his mind? Wouldn't he want to learn others' perspectives to further educate his own worldview?In the climactic scene, Brady asks Drummond \"Is it possible that something is holy to the celebrated agnostic?\" to which Drummond responds \"Yes! The individual human mind.\" Drummond further states \"An idea is a greater monument than a cathedral. And the advance of man's knowledge is a greater miracle than all the sticks turned to snakes through the parting of the waters.\" The original play Inherit the Wind was written in 1955 as a commentary on McCarthyism.

Instead, the gross caricatures of fundamentalist \"Christians\" stereotyped as bug-eyed, lynch-mob fanatics, coupled with the smirking, sanctimonious pontificating of the Tracy and Gene Kelley characters, results in something that comes across more like hysterical propaganda than effective historical storytelling.But my biggest objections to this movie are with regard to its pretension as court-room drama. Call me crazy, but to me the makings of a good courtroom drama include lawyers skillfully and cleverly presenting evidence, craftily examining and cross-examining witnesses, and developing strategies that will challenge the jurors, and have them, along with the viewers, swaying back and forth between a proclamation of guilt and innocence. Think of \"Anatomy of a Murder\" or \"The Verdict.\" \"Inherit the Wind\" doesn't come within the same universe of films like those.

In March of 1925 the Tennessee legislature had declared unlawful the teaching of any doctrine denying the divine creation of man as taught by the Bible. The trial has often been called \"The Scopes Monkey Trial.\"World attention focused on the trial proceedings, which promised confrontation between Fundamentalist literal belief and liberal interpretation of the Scriptures.Even after making Bryan look foolish on the stand, Darrow lost the case because Scopes admitted he broke the law. Darrow became world famous as a result of this trial.Just a few points are omitted from the original play, and the film.What was not clear to many was that John Scopes was encouraged by the ACLU to intentionally break this law so it could be tested in a public trial. This strategy backfired, however, when the judge ruled out any test of the law's constitutionality or argument on the validity of Darwin's theory, limiting the trial to the single question of whether or not Scopes had taught evolution, which he admittedly had.Scopes was convicted and fined $100. On appeal, the state supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the 1925 law but acquitted Scopes on the technicality that he had been fined excessively.

Sadly, the exact same debate about science vs. religion could play out today with little alteration, which doesn't say much for mankind but makes this movie continually relevant. And I especially liked the point the movie made about how those with a strong point of view, even a misguided one, are to be more admired than those who don't have any point of view at all, or who sit smugly back and toss out judgements without playing any actual role in the dialogue (like the Gene Kelly character).

They personify a time when great actors didn't have to look like Gods, but just had to act like people. These two extraordinary characters collide in explosive but authentic verbal jousting, and there are some magnificent speeches - particularly from Tracy's character, in defence of individual mind and thought.But what truly marks their playing out as special is the way they bring out the fact that these two great protagonists are in fact great friends who have known each other all their lives. The best scene in the film, for me, is that after a day of intense fighting in court, when they meet outside their hotel late at night and enjoy a friendly old-time reminiscence on the porch. There is no sense of hypocrisy in them getting along, just a genuine portrayal of respect and affection between two old rivals despite their profound disagreements on the issue. You wouldn't get that in films today - and if you did, it would not be played so authentically well.March in particular manages to present his character, though a staunch and harshly intolerant man, as extremely sympathetic and motivated by a true desire to do what he believes is in people's best interests. His character should be a villain. But by the end of the film we see him as a good man who was merely misguided.I can't recommend this film too highly. It is brilliant. The two leads are well supported by an excellent cast - so avoid the well-meaning re-makes and make sure you see this one. For those of us who love movies, the question, \"what is your favourite film of all?\" is never an easy one to answer. But I think, on balance, this is mine. See it.",

            "content": "This movie is supposed to be a retelling of the 1925 Scopes Trial (aka The Scopes Monkey Trial) in Dayton, TN. The names of people and places have been altered slightly. Nevertheless, the movie (and play) hardly resemble what really took place in Dayton that summer. It was illegal to teach evolution in the classroom in Dayton at that time. John Scopes (Bert in the movie), who happened to be a substitute biology teacher - normally the PE teacher, was on trial for allegedly teaching that man evolved from the apes. The ACLU defended Scopes with well-known defense attorney Clarence Darrow. The prosecution was headed by William Jennings Bryan, a popular politician and self-proclaimed theologian. The townsfolk in the movie are portrayed as cruel and intolerant and in one scene want to lynch Scopes. In real life, Clarence Darrow remarked that the people of Dayton, TN were some of the nicest people on earth and had treated him and his client with great respect. This is just one of the many misrepresentations of what really happened. The actual transcript of the trial has recently been made available. I would encourage anyone who is interested in the truth of this event to read that. Unfortunately, this movie (and play) are nothing more than an attack on the Christian faith, especially concerning the Genesis account of creation. While Bryan had great intentions, he did a poor job of defending Christianity yet still won the case. This movie could have been very good if it accurately portrayed what happened and it still would have succeeded in making Christians look bad because Bryan performed poorly when he took the witness stand. Don't waste your time with this propaganda piece unless you have read the transcript or watched Dr. David Menton's video entitled \"Inherently Wind\" which compares and contrasts the movie with the facts of the case.",

            "content": "The films Judgment at Nuremburg and Inherit the Wind aren't so much artistic experiences as polemic ones. Although both movies hang their hat on historical events, neither film is actually about the surface events in the film. Directed by the same man and released within a year of each other, their purpose was to get audiences rooting for the forces of reason, and oppose the irrationality of the herd mentality Judgment at Nuremburg is about a fictional trial of German judges who let themselves be swept up in the ethnic hatred promoted by the Nazis, delivering verdicts that they had decided upon before the trials over violations of racial purity laws had even begun. The film was written as a reaction against McCarthyism, which had gripped America for a decade and burned out just five years before the film. The film intended to show the danger of movements of mass hysteria, and how easy it is for an entire society to commit atrocities in the name of defending their country. The movie's tactics are heavy-handed. You can almost see the defense attorney getting rabid as he uses the same vicious illogic to attack the prosecution's witnesses as he used to shred the defense's witnesses when he prosecuted defendants on behalf of the Third Reich. If that weren't obvious enough, the movie drives the point home with a monologue from one of the defendants about how the judges lied to themselves -- first to protect their country from the Russian threat, then to save themselves at the expense of innocent people. A modern American audience might be entitled shake their heads at the absurdity of Nazism and McCarthyism, if it weren't for the same phenomenon taking place today, with Muslim terrorists being the scapegoats and justification for a range of brutalities and civil rights restrictions.Inherit the Wind is, on the surface, about the famous Scopes evolution-teaching trial in Tennessee in the 1930's. The movie paints a stark portrait of those enlightened by science and the ability to think for themselves as oppressed by those caught in the mindless vise-grip of fundamental Christianity. There is some sparkling courtroom dialog between the two leads, but the point was clearly to portray the fundamentalists as idiotic buffoons. While I'm all in favor of putting facts ahead of faith, caricaturing opponents of your viewpoint may make good propaganda, but it's terrible drama. Despite this, the movie is instructive about the constancy of this particular struggle, since it continues today, using the same arguments on both sides. In fact, the divide between the rationalists and religionists is arguably worse today, as both camps diverge on a growing number of fundamental values.My reactions to these movies was not so much to like them or dislike them, but to despair over the fact that as a nation and as human beings, we continue the insanely destructive patterns depicted 45 years ago. It seems that we have learned nothing from our past, or perhaps, as human beings, we are simply locked into a limited set of behaviors that doom us.",

            "review_title": "And The Monkeys Shall Inherit the Wind?",
            "content": "Inherit the Wind directed by Stanley Kramer in 1960 was based on the play of the same name by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee.  They wrote Inherit the Wind as a response to the threat to intellectual freedom presented by the anti-communist hysteria of the McCarthy era.  The movie depicts the famous Scopes trial where schoolteacher John T. Scopes in movie Bertram T. Cates (Dick York) was arrested in Hillsboro, Tennessee for teaching Darwin's theory of evolution, which was against state law.  The law forbade the teaching of any doctrine denying the divine creation of man as taught by the bible. The trial shows the confrontation between fundamentalist literal belief of the bible and people who believed the bible was allegory or myth. The attorney paid for by Baltimore journalist E.K. Hornbeck (Gene Kelly) for the defense was the famed trial lawyer Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy) and the prosecutor was the orator and statesman Matthew Harrison Brady (Fredric March).  The trial is set to decide whether God's word or the word of science should be taught in school.Inherit the Wind does not purport to be a historically accurate depiction of the Scopes trial. The place names and names of trial participants have been changed.  The trial actually took place in Dayton, Tennessee not Hillsboro, Tennessee, but the carnival like atmosphere surrounding the trial did exist. The case should not have gone as far as it did, but it was a publicty stunt by the people of Dayton.  Lest there be any doubt, even the pattern of the names and the number of syllables in each name carefully match the real names of the people they purport to portray.  The prosecutor, Matthew Harrison Brady, represents William Jennings Bryan from the real event is portrayed as an almost comical fanatic who dramatically dies of a heart attack while attempting to deliver his summation in a chaotic courtroom. The Bryan actually died five days later after the trial ended of a cerebral hemorage not a `busted belly' as said in the movie.  Bryan had in fact run for president three times as said in the movie (1896, 1900, and 1908).  He was a democrat who appealed to the common man including many farmers and was the secretary of state before.  Fredric March's physical portrayal of the balding Bryan bears a striking resemblance as well.  Furthermore, Henry Drummond is actually the famed defense lawyer Clarence Darrow.  Darrow was a great defense attorney from Chicago who opposed the fyndamentalist beliefs of his rival Bryan.  He had been in many important cases in his years as an attorney but the Scopes trial was his last case.  Darrow is less cynical and biting than as his Drummond character he was shown.  In addition, the journalist E.K. Hornbeck from the Baltimore Herald is actually H.L. Menkein from the Baltimore Sun.  H.L. Menkein did work with the Baltimore Herald, but in 1906, he switched to the Baltimore Sun long before the Scopes Trial. Menkein was a great writer and and incredible intellectual.  He was accurately portrayed as a biting, sarcastic critic in the film.  As mentioned above, John T. Scopes is shown as Bertam T. Cates in the film. Scopes actually was not even a real teacher but rather a long-term substitute teacher instead.  After the trial he never taught school again and became a geologist.  In an effort to dramatize the movie several fictional characters were created, including a fundamentalist preacher, Reverand Jeremiah Brown, and his daughter, Rachel Brown, who is the fianc\u00e9 of John Scopes. The townspeople of fictional Hillsboro are far more frenzied, mean-spirited, and ignorant than were the real denizens of Dayton.Some theatrical liberties were exercised in developing the plot but the courtroom screenplay was adapted word for word from the transcript of the Scopes trial.  The events that take place around the courtroom drama are largely fictional.  The movie begins with John Scopes getting caught teaching evolution and he is indicted for breaking the law against teaching evolution.  Scopes is immediately jailed and remains in jail throughout the trial.  Where as in reality no one ever intruded in John Scopes' classroom. Scopes was not kept in jail as shown and he only agreed to a trial because he thought it would be very low key.  The law that provided the basis for Scopes' arrest in Tennessee was the Butler Act.  The Butler Act was rarely enforced and was only an issue because the ACLU approached Scopes.  During the trial, it was in fact very hot and the people had fans.  The trial which went on for several weeks not just a few days as the film made it seem was moved outside to deal with the excessive heat.  Scopes was found guilty and ordered to pay a fine of one hundred dollars. Later, on appeal, the state Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law but acquitted Scopes on the technicality that he had been fined excessively. The Butler Actwas finally repealed in 1967.  William Jennings Bryan died five days after the initial trial not on the courtroom floor as depicted in the film.  This was the first major trial that radio was a part of and the involvement of radio was accurately depicted in the movie.  The material culture was very accurate.  The suits, broad brimmed hats, and suspenders of the men were accurately depicted.  The wearing of shifty, loose dresses by the women was well done too.  The lawyers and men in the court did ask to take their coats off, as socially at the time the coat was an important component of men's clothes.  The film was very well produced and incorporates song components that better set the feeling for the time-period of the movie.Inherit the Wind in following closely on the heels of the McCarthy era, was very much an allegory of its time.  This dimension is fully exploited by Kramer and his screenwriters. Indeed, if he film can be faulted at all, it is on this level: The townspeople seems a trifle too bigoted, while Drummond's unrelenting altruism is equally suspect.  Just the right degree of cynical detachment is brought to the pivotal role of E. K. Hornbeck without once sacrificing the empathy of the audience.  Kramer's version therefore, becomes an affirmation of the worth of all people, modernist, or fundamentalist, orthodox and progressive. Even the final scene is an attempt to downplay this cultural conflict and look for some consensus. As Drummond walks out of the courtroom, with the Bible and Darwin side by side in his briefcase, an old religious hymn begins to play. As `Glory, Glory Hallelujah' echoes throughout the courtroom, this atheist evolutionist, defender of the modernist viewpoint, seems more religious than ever.Technically this film was very sound.  The use of black and white color sets the audience in the early 20th century scene in the great South of America. Stanley Kreimer is quite a fine director with many movies to his credit and his talents were fully displayed in Inherit the Wind.  Using many visuals and signs throughout the length of the movie, the film is clear and easy to follow.Overall, I thought that Inherit the Wind is a very valuable film. It is not the most entertaining film for modern audiences but if you enjoy classic acting and a classic plot this film is definitely for you.  I feel that all students should view this movie at some point in time for their own educational purposes.  For to fully understand why they are learning certain ideas in school as opposed to others and the struggle that has insued to determine which ideas should be taught in our schools. This trial raised for the first time in people's mind the question of academic freedom of speech and may do the same for modern viewers facing similar problems with the educational system that conflict with their own personal beliefs.",

            "content": "A very good film with a very controversial subject (Creationism Vs. Darwinism) that I believe is still relevant today. Stanley Kramer gets strong and powerful performances from all his principal actors beginning with, of course, Spencer Tracy as the defense attorney. Tracy's head-on confrontation with prosecutor Fredric March (in a delightfully over the top portrayal) is the stuff great dramas are made of. Also surprisingly impressive is Gene Kelly here. Special nods go to Harry Morgan as the judge, Claude Akins as a narrow-minded preacher and Dick York as the young teacher on trial.On the negative side, though I am against severe organized religion, I found the movie to be very biased against Christianity in general, as it depicts all believers as evil and backwards in their thinking. Indeed, this Christiaphobic film may be an atheist's dream come true. How much of this is a Stanley Kramer agenda, I don't know; after all, this movie was already a play which itself was based on the actual Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925. I don't subscribe to the Theory of Evolution personally, so it was perhaps a bit more difficult relating to Tracy and Kelly as much as I might have liked to. I certainly support the sensibilities of allowing all people to think for themselves, but whether or not Darwinism should be taught to students as \"science fact\" rather than \"theory\" is another matter.But as far as a rewarding movie-going experience, INHERIT THE WIND is highly recommended and provides much food for thought. It's drama at its finest.",

            "content": "The more human mind is devoid of satisfying comprehension of its world, the hungrier it will be of spirituality, abstractions and superstitions to absorb all the eschatological fears. It seems then logical that the more accessible to scientific knowledge we are, the thinner those needs get. And while in 1925, Science had already made giant leaps, breaking the ultimate taboo of man's sacredness through Darwin's groundbreaking Theory of Evolution, a modern Salem Witch Hunt occurred in Hillsboro where a teacher was arrested because he dared to explain evolution to his biology class. It was so preposterous that the trial was a mockery before it even started, called the 'Monkey trial' and soiling the Southern town of Hillsboro with anachronistic infamy. But a film like Stanley Kramer's \"Inherit the Wind\" doesn't call for simplifications. The opening sequence driven by a haunting choir hymn \"Gimme that Good Old Religion\" seems to suggest that there's more than bigotry, more than defiance toward Science behind the reactionary trial. And the script, brought to life by two standout performances from Spencer Tracy as the liberal Henry Drummond and Frederic March as the fundamentalist Matthew Brady, provides quite satisfactory answers to a rather complex question.The intelligence of \"Inherit the Wind' is to confront the two divergent attitudes in a sort of once-and-for-all move: the bigots who want the head of the poor teacher (Dick York) versus the atheists who believe that God shouldn't interfere with knowledge. To avoid, with more- or-less efficiency, a partial treatment, there's a crucial character, played by Gene Kelly. E.K. Hornbuck is the journalist assigned to cover the trial for a Baltimore newspaper; a man so outraged there's not a single line he delivers without venom of condescendence.Hornbuck works as the alter ego of the fanatic priest (Claude Akins) who'd disown his own daughter because she has a relationship with the teacher. I suppose the romantic subplot is pointless and its only added value is to show how extreme some reactions get when driven by a feverish radicalism. The priest is corrected by Brady who quotes the Bible, reminding him that who 'causeth trouble in his own house might inherit the wind'. On the other side, Drummond isn't too rough on Hornbuck because he's still his only ally, but you can see that, and that's a credit to Tracy's Oscar-nominated performance, he respects his old pal Brady and his patience with Hornbuck isn't unlimited. Friendship put aside, the conflict between the Bible and Science is never as exhilarating as when these two grown-ups express their rivalries with enraged conviction, one that goes from the crucial: questioning the books to the funny triviality of honorific titles. It's one of the greatest battles of speeches in the history of Cinema, the fight of two giants that coincided with another one in France, Charles Vanel and Paul Meurisse in Clouzot's courtroom drama \"The Truth\". The acting from the two 'Jekylls' elevates the conflict to a passionate level. March gets histrionic and over-the-top at times but it's not without reasons, he has the mimics of a man who plays a role. Three-times running for presidency, he sure knows how to use words, to harangue crowds and in the modest town of Hillsboro, he's put in the comfortable position of a preacher preaching convinced people. It's an open-and-shut case and what is left for him is to shine, to be admired, to have the time of his life and ultimately get blinded by his own passion and lower his guard.And Drummond will get him when denouncing the logical evolution of passion: emotional fascism, and the censor of rational analysis, the key to all the progresses that made humanity conquer the world. Knowledge has a price and in one of the most brilliant statements ever made in film, Tracy confronts the townspeople to the limits of religion, yes it should be the 'relegere' that reassembles people under a fair law, not the 'relegere' that reads again, lectures on the basis of poetic tales. When March retorts by pleading like a modern prophet, he not only misses Drummond's point but also proves himself totally out of place.After he let Brady unveil his own limitations, a bitter Drummond can finally put Hornbeck in his place by asking him what his ideals were anyway, he who was so eager to trash people of different positions. I'm not sure it worked like Kramer intended to, but the journalist figure was interestingly emblematic of the current attitude toward religion, where in the name of modernity, anything deemed sacred is immediately deemed as archaic and dangerous. Oddly enough, even well intentioned thoughts have lead to such black-and-white judgments and ultimately, clash between different cultures.I believe George W. Bush was sincere by saying that the man he respected the most was Jesus, a convenient answer that had the merit to ring true, but I despise the fact that he let his fundamentalist clique lead American to believe that all Muslims were enemies while they were, in the words of Brady when he described Christians, only reflecting a hate that was exercised against them. Interestingly, a similar story can be told with religion in the accused box and this is how relevant \"Inherit the Wind\" is. It's not about what is religious but what is sacred. And today, religion stopped being sacred because we can discuss it.Yet, anything sacred is worth being debate and when a country forbids woman to wear a veil in the name of some values, why doesn't they acknowledge the right of this woman to think that she should wear it. In France, laws forbid the discussion about some historical subjects in the name of a fight against revisionism. By arbitrarily making out-of-order sanctification's, aren't politicians causing troubles in their own houses, thus taking the risk to \u0085 inherit the wind.",

Lee's brilliant 1955 play about the infamous 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial in Tennessee is a fantastic story, an extremely well-acted movie and a deeply moving and thought-provoking drama. It succeeds so well by creating wonderfully extravagant but also painfully real characters. It's not really about the politics of the issue (it was written more as a critique of McCarthyism), it's about people, passion and what our differences can do to us. Drummond may be sympathetic, but he is not without his flaws. Brady may be misguided, but his intentions are righteous. Cates, his fianc\u00e9e Rachel, and Drummond's wife Sarah are all richly observed, and the only contempt in the movie is for the cynical journalist Hornbeck (based on the writer H.L. Mencken), whose disdain for the parochial townsfolk and disinterest in the principal being fought for is a prescient foreshadow of tabloid newspapers. Beautifully shot by the talented Ernest Laszlo (Kiss Me Deadly, Fantastic Voyage); the heat in the courtroom is palpable.

The two lawyers are representative of the noted civil libertarian Clarence Darrow and US Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan. One of the great things about movies is that they allow us to understand other points of view, and to turn intellectual debate into entertaining drama.

Dayton, Tenn. where the Scopes trial was held is close to my birthplace. Tracy and March do a superior job of playing the old war-horses, who have also been friends at another time.  The young Dick York (in his pre-AIDs acting days) plays Scopes.  All have pseudonyms, which makes me wonder.  Why was it necessary?  The acting and screenplay and direction by Stanly Kramer are all superb. In a book on Stanley Kramer, the author says that it is still against the law in Tenn. to teach evolution.!!!!Noting that there was a time when 'Does it make money?' did not represent an excuse to rape the planet and cheat the consumer, we see the banker offering to back the farmer, who offers to put up bail for Tracey (playing Clarence Darrow).  He also makes the wonderful point that \"If our town is seen to be ignorant, industry will not come here, and our children will not be accepted into Ivy League schools\".

Darrow was an atheist, yet Tracy ends this excellent film preaching a bunch of pap to Kelly about 'being miserable unless you believe in something'.  That wasn't true to either of the real people being depicted.  Many of us agnostics pray more sincerely and as often as any Bible-totin' church-goin' hypocrite.This movie won beacoup awards, as well it should.

No, you don't have to demonize the 'good, respectable people of small-town Tenness'.  The point is better made when you keep them human, as we all have this mob mentality/psychosis within us.  Read any treatise on 'group psychology' and it's apparent.I watched this movie, and will have to go at it again, now that I've read the various encyclopedia treatments of the Scopes trial.  Are our kids even being taught about this anymore?  Are the children of Kansas being taught about ignorance/religiosity?. With the appallingly low standards we have for teachers now, accompanied by their appallingly low salaries, it's a wonder that anyone would have the courage to bring up such a 'controversial' subject. Having been raised in the Bible Belt, I am more appalled as time goes by at the evil done and still being committed under the guise of Christianity. And Jesus wept.",

Christians being part of a mob mentality and wishing harm to innocents and then no real resolution as it just focuses on the one man. If the teacher Cates really was on trail and it wasn't just a debate, then why wasn't he ever on the stand? And if it was just a debate, what's the point if you only hear one side of the argument. I am yet to see any character of Spencer Tracy tested in any way. The same smug, cool, I'm better than everyone character without layers in every film, and he's considered one of the greats, I don't get it. The two main women, Rachel Brown and Brady's wife Sarah were standouts in the film I thought. Donna Anderson was bursting under that outfit to my eyes.Sarah: Youth can be so pure. What do you know of good or evil? What do you understand of the sum of a man's life? Rachel Brown: He betrayed me! Sarah: You betrayed yourself! You see my husband as a saint, and so he must be right in everything he says and does. And then you see him as a devil, and everything he says and does must be wrong. Well my husband's neither a saint nor a devil. He's just a human being, and he makes mistakes. Rachel Brown : How can you defend him? Sarah Brady: It's not he I'm defending! I'm defending the forty years I've lived with this man, and watched him carry the burdens of people like you! If he's been wrong, at least he stood for something! What do you stand for? Do you believe in Bertram Cates? I believe in my husband. What do you believe in?",

Too bad journalists were no longer that good even when this film was made. Spencer Tracy is near the end of his career & though he shows energy in this film, it is not anywhere near the top role he played.Dick York was a big surprise to me as the teacher who was on trial for teaching evolution. Though it is not a starring role, he shows dramatic ability that never came through much on Bewitched. The film does have 1 ironic line. \"What if law makers passed a law which restricted the teaching of religion in schools the way this proposed law bans the teaching of evolution?\"What is interesting is how the evolution battle is being re-fought again today. On the side of the people who want to go backwards are the Meteorologists who want everyone to think that man is pushing the earth out of control by producing Global Warming/Climate Change. These weather Poindexter's can produce statistics that prove man is causing a global catastrophe by altering the environment. (Charlie Brown once said to Lucy - \"Lucy, tell your statistics to shut up!\")Their opposition- ironically- is evidence of geologists, archaeologists, earth scientists, and evolutionists are not organized so they can not be heard. Charles Darwin if he were alive today would fight to point out problems with Global Warming/Climate Change theory. It assumes a static, unchanging earth which can not change or evolve. Darwin would tell anyone that \"Evolution is change\". Climate Change is trying to prevent global change which will naturally happen no matter what man does.Enviromentalism has been taught incorrectly for a generation now. Environment is a delicate balance between man & nature. Removing either one from the environment is much more dangerous than anyone can imagine. Man has been a part of the environment for thousands of years.Evolution, at it's heart is the theory man being changed by the effects of the earth environment & time upon him. That is what this trial attempts to prove. It is the reverse of Global Warming/ Climate change theories which assume that Earth can not change when effected by man. The fact is, the earth has already changed when effected by man over time. It is this interaction which the Scopes trial proves.",

Laws restricting the teaching of this theory are bad laws, and Scopes was guilty of violating one such law.  Religious creeds are sometimes (gasp!) false.  Religions are dogmatic; that's what makes them religions.  Which of these banal truths, I wonder, did Kramer mistake for a live issue, something worth making a film about?  \"Inherit the Wind\" is too intellectually mushy to allow us to tell.Only one of the points made by the fundamentalists is even worthy of airtime, although it probably isn't true either: the empirical claim that people who accept Darwin's theory will on average behave less morally than those who deny it.  Given sociological facts about America this is at least plausible.  Kramer argues against this view by cheating: he shows us the devout youth of the town being \"led astray\", and the free-thinking youth behaving honourably.  Right, like THAT proves anything.  It IS true that the threat of eternal posthumous suffering, coupled with the conditional promise of eternal posthumous bliss, is an ineffective motivator; very likely its net effect on human behaviour, if any, isn't for the best.  But Kramer offers us not even the shallowest insight into the psychology behind this.The real-life trial wasn't about anything, either.  It was simply a way of marking time before an inevitable (or so people thought) showdown in the High Court.  So, no doubt, the shameless grandstanding we see here is true to life.  But it's not worth listening to - or at least, would not be worth listening to, were it not for the fact that Spencer Tracy delivers his empty lines with passion, gusto, charm, unsurpassed histrionic skill...  The truth, which I must admit sooner or later, is that I enjoyed this movie a good deal, and Spencer Tracy is the main reason I did so.  There are a few minor virtues, too.

In a rare dramatic appearance, Dick York, of the comedy \"Betwitched\" television show portrayed the accused teacher.Spencer Tracy plays Clarence Darrow who defended him and in the process received his 8th Oscar nomination. He is forcefully matched by Fredric March who, as prosecuting attorney, three-time presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan, is absolutely sensational in the role of a obsessed religious freak who wanted the teacher convicted to serve as an example to the anti-religious scientific group.Stanley Kramer, who was always involved in making films of social significance, does a masterful job here in depicting a Tennessee neighborhood that in its religious fanaticism, has lost the fact that we live in a democracy and not a theocracy.If Bryan were a zealous as the film depicts, it's amazing that he was a 3 time candidate for the presidency and we should be grateful that he lost each time in 1896, 1900 and 1908. Why did they bother to change the major names of the characters? We knew who they represented anyway.Florence Eldridge, the real-life wife of Fredric March, was effective here as his faithful wife in the film.Usual tough guy, Claude Akins, is wonderful as the fanatical minister whose daughter loves York.Harry Morgan, as the judge, shows that he is biased in the case but will listen, especially when it is shown that March talks to the lord.By the way, how come a change of venue wasn't demanded by the defense team? The rural town is totally made up of religious fanatics.

The story based on the Scopes monkey trial has found receptive audiences on stage, screen and TV versions. But for me the best rendition of the tale was in this film, a classic if ever there was one.The actual trial took place in 1925 when the movie is set and involved a school teacher who had the audacity to teach evolution in his classroom. The true tale found him defended by one of the most brilliant minds in defense law Clarence Darrow while the man facing off against him was three time presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan. From this story the play and then movies were made.Bertram Cates (Dick York) is accused of teaching evolution against the law of the state of Tennessee. Condemned by both the local politicians as well as the leading town minister Rev. Jeremiah Brown (Claude Akins) it appears that he will have no luck finding an impartial jury. When newsman E.K. Hornbeck (Gene Kelly) hears of the story he turns it into a cause and gets plenty of support from his newspaper.The story grows and rather than allow the local prosecutor try the case a special prosecutor is brought in. Matthew Harrison Brady (Frederic March) is an ex-presidential nominee and popular Chautauqua speaker and well-loved by many. When Hornbeck hears this he convinces his newspaper to pick up the defense for Cates and they bring in Henry Drummond (Spencer Tracy), a noted rabble rousing defense attorney who is quite successful but not as adored by the townsfolk as Brady is. The two are long-time friends and Drummond is greeted fondly by both Brady and his wife Sarah (Florence Eldridge).The build up to the trial takes up a good portion of the film. Rev. Brown incites the townsfolk against Cates much to the chagrin of his daughter Rachel (Donna Anderson) who is engaged to Cates. It is not a relationship that will bode well with the events taking place. And Rev. Brown seems more interested in making a name for himself than in his daughter.Eventually the trial progresses and it is here that much of the best of the film is seen. The back and forth between the two lead characters of Brady and Drummond is amazing to watch and listen to. The legal back and forth as well as the ponderance of the question at hand, is it possible evolution is real, make for fascinating. By the end of the film no matter what your belief is you will find something to question on both sides.What the movie boils down to is two very different yet compelling performances by two of the greats of classic cinema. Both March and Tracy were well past their prime popularity wise but find in this vehicle something with which to reclaim their fame as two of the best actors of their age or any other. March is wonderful to witness here but I've long been a fan of Tracy, one of the most underrated actors of all time. Kelly does a great job here as well playing something different for a change, a sleazy slime ball of a character looking to gain prestige at the cost of others involved.The movie is a joy to watch from start to finish and Twilight Time has done a great job with their presentation here offering the cleanest version of the film to date. Extras are very limited to just an isolated music & effects track and the original theatrical trailer. But as with all of their releases it is limited to just 3,000 copies so movie lovers should pick this up before they are gone.",

            "content": "I wrote that famous saying because, if you have respect for history, you know about how in 1925, one biology teacher, John T. Scopes, was arrested and tried in Dayton, Tennessee for teaching the theory of evolution to his high school students in a state where the act was illegal (Scopes, for accurate history's sake, volunteered to challenge the law on a bet). Nowadays, creationism, the belief that God created life, is being decorated as \"intelligence design\" by fundamental Christians who want the idea taught in public schools. Though a judicial defeat came in Dover, Pennsylvania, the idea hasn't lost steam. Just look at the public school system in the state of Kansas. Yeech!!!!Anyway, \"Inherit The Wind\" is a fictional account of the \"Monkey Trial\" Scopes endured, written by Joseph Lawrence and Robert E. Lee as a play. Socially conscious filmmaker Stanley Kramer (\"Judgment At Nuremberg\", \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?\") took the play to the silver screen and the conclusion is smart, quart-amount funny and proves that having an opinion different from the status quo doesn't (and shouldn't) mean a person should suffer the wrath of judicial condemnation (Hear that, you McCarthies and Asscrofties!).Bertram T. Cates (a gaunt, brave Dick York) replaces Scopes as the accused in the town of Hillsboro, \"the buckle of the Bible belt\". His fianc\u00e9e, Rachel Brown (Donna Anderson) wants to him to admit his guilt and apologize, so their marriage could be a holy union in the eyes of the town's citizens, particularly her preacher father. Cates stands firm, even though high-confidence biblical lawyer and three-times Presidential candidate Matthew Harrison Brady (a spirited Frederic March, whose character swaps with William Jennings Bryant) has volunteered to assist the prosecution. Brady sees \"God's on trial\", but he didn't count on an old friend, civil rights attorney Henry Drummond (an aging yet scrappy Spencer Tracy), a trade for Clarence Darrow, to defend Cates.\"Wind\" is an unusual but heated boxing match. Pro and con opinion holders are boxers meeting in the ring, facing each other and sizing each other up. Onlookers are referees. Nobody throws fists, only words, and thanks must given to Ernest Laszlo, the genius behind the film's cinematography. Two-time Oscar holders Tracy (nominated for this acting gig) and March defend the opposing beliefs as \"colonels\", deemed by judicial power. And when they argue, they argue! Critics have deemed famed song-and-dance man Gene Kelly (\"On The Town\", \"Singing In The Rain\") miscast for the role of E.K. Hornbeck, the faux version of holy ideal-scoffing newsman, H.L. Mencken, who delightfully demeans Brady, his supporters and their belief in God, but the performance is eye-wink ironic. Kelly pokes righteous fun at the \"moral people\" who have enjoyed his usual musical performances yet have bigoted views against people and ideas different from themselves. However, Kelly's Hornbeck learns he's no different from them in his championing of Cates.A sharp cast occupies the film, littered with future TV players. York is best known as the first Darrin Stevens of the sitcom \"Bewitched\"; Claude Atkins (\"B.J. And the Bear) is a vehement sour puss as the Reverend Jeremiah Brown; Brady cheerleader Jesse H. Dunlap is played by Ray Teal, of the western drama, \"Bonanza\"; Harry Morgan (the late 1960s TV version of \"Dragnet\", M.A.S.H.: The Sitcom) is the no-nonsense judge; a simple farmer is played by Noah Berry Jr. of the detective drama, \"The Rockford Files\", and Norman Fell (\"Three's Company\") has a funny, little part as a radio technician.Two interesting notes: Florence Eldridge, March's real-life wife, plays Brady's wife, Sarah, who shows not everyone on her husband's side is fanatical, and her husband's is \"just a man\". Also, the film's co-writer, Nedrick Young, had to use the pseudonym, Nathan E. Douglas, in order to be credited with fellow scribe Harold Jacob Smith on the film, let alone work in Hollywood, despite his then-blacklisted status for having Communist ties. How real life and fantasy can intertwine\u0085 The 1988 TV remake is a wooden penny, with Jason Robards and Kirk Douglas miscast as Drummond and Brady. The producers probably wanted \"a theatrical play\" to the film, but a play and a film are two different animals. However, Darren McGavin of the pre-\"X Files\", sci-fi/horror/fantasy drama, \"Kolchak: The Night Stalker\" is more than suitable as Hornbeck, since he played an outlaw newsman on TV, and gives the snail-like story some sparks. Superiority is present in the 1999 version with Jack Lemmon as Drummond (he won an Golden Globe), George C. Scott as Brady, Piper Laurie as Sarah, a crackerjack tongued Beau Bridges (his and his brother Jeff's dad, Lloyd Bridges, was also blacklisted) as Hornbeck, Tom Everett Scott as Cates and a pretty, pre-\"Cold Case\" Kathryn Morris as Rachel. I hope Sony/MGM will release the better version on DVD soon.\"Wind\", as the play, the 1960 and the 1999 film versions, should be mandatory material in high school because the story's lesson is the right to think, no matter how agnostic or religious you are, is a holy gift.",

However, I would like to comment upon a very interesting coincidence involving the role of one of the characters in this film, E.K. Hornbeck, a newspaper reporter covering the \"Monkey\" trial (played brilliantly by Gene Kelly, the character being, most agree, after H.L. Mencken, the prominent newspaperman, book reviewer and political commentator who covered the actual Scopes trial in 1925.) Kelly plays a cynical newspaperman who is the \"bete noire,\" the gadfly of both Henry Drummond (the Spencer Tracy character) and Matthew Harrison Brady (the Frederic March character.) For Hornbeck everything is false, everything is a \"con\" in one way or another, including Brady's old-style religion and Drummond's belief that modern science and philosophy belie a literal reading of the Bible.In another fine film - some say also one of the finest ever produced by Hollywood - Elmer Gantry - Arthur Kennedy also plays the role of a newspaperman, covering the religious \"revivals\" held by the lead characters, played to perfection by Jean Simmons and the incomparable Burt Lancaster. Simmons plays Sister Sharon Falconer, who really believes - at least at the right moments - that she's speaking to God and God to her, especially when her minions are passing the trays for contributions in the revival tents. Lancaster, as Gantry, is a down-and outer with a silver tongue who charms his way into Falconer's inner circle (and later into her boudoir) who believes only in separating the marks from enough of their money so that he and Sharon can get out while the getting's good and ride off together into the sunset. The coincidence is that Kennedy - the cynical reporter who sees and understands all that is going on, expresses his contempt and cynicism at every opportunity, thus playing the role of a \"foil\" strikingly like the role played by Kelly in Inherit the Wind. (The Greeks had a name for such a character - the leader of the Greek chorus, or \"Choragos,\" who commented upon the action in a play but took no part in it.) As Kelly did, Kennedy played the part to perfection.So anyone who enjoyed Kennedy's role in Gantry should definitely see and carefully study Kelly's role in Inherit the Wind, and vice versa.

It's hardly the first time Gene Kelly has left his dancing pumps at home, as early as 1946 he played a psychopath in Christmas Holiday for Universal and went on to appear in the forgettable Black Hand - but this is the first half decent straight performance he has turned in. Similarly Claude Akins is cast against type and scores heavily as a religious fanatic. Harry Morgan enhances yet one more movie, something he has done time and again, which brings us to the two leads; I've always found Frederick March something of a ham from the Charles Laughton Academy of risible dramatic acting but ham is the perfect description for his character, Matthew Harrison Brady (William Jennings Bryan). By contrast Spencer Tracy contrives to give the impression that acting is the last thing on his mind which again is perfect for HIS character, Henry Drummond (Clarence Darrow). Alas the best quote isn't in the film, but then it couldn't be because it was said - actually written - by the real newspaperman Paul Y Anderson, of the St Louis Post Despatch, who actually covered the trial; cognizant that Bryan was best known as an orator and had become famous for his speech in favour of retaining the Silver standard whose climax was '...you shall not crucify manking upon a cross of gold'. Anderson's headline was \"William Jennings Bryan, born on a cross of gold, died on a cross examination'. This remains an excellent film.",

            "content": "In a country that was based on the idea that a person could think freely and have the right to his own ideas, it is hard to believe that within this very same country, a group of people believed that only certain beliefs should be taught.In 1925, a High School teacher was arrested for violating the recently instituted Butler Act. This stated that any teachings going against the Divine Creation of man as is taught in the Bible is prohibited. This teacher, John T. Scopes, taught his class Darwin's Theory of Evolution and how humans come from a long line of animals. The trial that ensued would be one of the most memorable in US history.Director Stanley Kramer's Inherit the Wind, based on the real 1925 Scopes Trial, brings to life one of the most controversial court cases of all time. Using three power houses of the big screen, there are bound to be some fireworks in what once was a small, quiet Tennessee town.Spencer Tracy, Frederic March, and Gene Kelly electrify the courtroom with passion and intensity. After hearing what has happened to the teacher, Bertram T. Cates (Dick York), Henry Drummond (Tracy) is sent down by the Baltimore Herald, more specifically reporter E.K. Hornbeck (Kelly). The prosecution however has some fire power of its own. Once considered a candidate for the presidency, Matthew Harrison Brady (March) will represent the state.Teaching Darwinism in the Bible Belt of America back in those days certainly would not bring you the right kind of attention. When Drummond and Hornbeck come to town they are greeted with the similar hatred and ignorance that Cates had been approached with. Brady on the other hand is treated like a prophet.Drummond, Brady, and Hornbeck are all based on the real people involved in the trial. Although the names have been changed, facts taken out, and truths stretched, the film serves its purpose. Certainly the most intense moments of the film are between Drummond and Brady, the two heavyweights going at it on and off the stand.Tracy and March's dynamic performances feed off of each other bringing you to the edge of your seat. The hot summer days spent in that courtroom are brought to a boil when these go at it. One interesting aspect of this relationship is that after a day in court, the two can be seen socializing, reminiscing of times gone by, as if nothing had just happened earlier.Probably the most intense and emotionally driven part of the film is the scene where Drummond has called Brady to testify. This too happened in the real Scopes trial and is one of the boldest attempts taken at a trial. Tracy and March shine in their characters as the two men square off in a war of words about the Bible and Darwin's the Origin of Species. The fiery debate of whether or not a man has the right and the power to think on his own and to teach this theory of evolution. A truly compelling scene that will leave a person drained from excitement.The film in its entirety is exceptionally well made. Kramer does an excellent job of selling the tension between Cates and the townspeople. We get to see the ugly side of what happens when people are not accepting and only believe that they are right. The song \"Old Time Religion\" played throughout the film is a nice accompaniment displaying the feel and attitude of the situation.No matter what your belief is of the creation or evolution of humans, this film speaks volumes about how far we have come as society on a whole, and how we still have a long way to go.",

            "content": "Based on a stage play dramatisation of the famous \"Scopes Monkey\" trial in the United States in 1925 in which the God-fearing sought to keep down the Free-thinking, the main attraction of the movie is to see veteran Golden Age stars in Spencer Tracy and Fredruc March square off against each other on opposites sides of the divide. I personally was disappointed with some of the dramatic licence taken with the true-life story, for instance the creation of fictional characters such as the young fianc\u00e9e of the accused schoolteacher and her fire and brimstone hell-fire preacher of a father and worst of all the ludicrous invention that March's defeated religious zealot character should mid- rant just barely after the jury's decision comes in. These devices seem very crude and unnecessary and are obviously there to enliven the story. Personally I would have preferred to have heard more of the real life testimonies of the participants and I really think these were two of the main weaknesses in the telling of the tale.Certainly director Kramer captures that hot-house down-south atmosphere as the air-condition-less courtroom and all its occupants are caught inside in the rising heat (both metaphorically and realistically speaking). He captures well the small-town mentality of its bible-thumping residents, the majority of whom are clearly on God's side, as it were, but in the main he lets his two ageing stars have the floor and hammer away at each other like veteran boxers. Tracy's part seems the easier to play of the two, being seemingly an extension of his crusty real-life persona, while March possibly overacts his part, hard to avoid though with such an over-the-top persona. Gene Kelly, like Fred Astaire at around the same time trying to establish himself as a character actor, seems badly miscast as the principled, cynical reporter based in H L Mencken, you keep expecting him to finish all his scenes with jazz-hands and a cheesy smile. Dick York, actually quietly impressive as the truth-telling teacher, of course kept his bow-tie on for his later long-running part as the husband Darren in \"Bewitched\", but another comedy star of the future Harry Morgan, later a staple in \"M.A.S.H.\" is out of his depth here as the biased God-fearing judge.Today I like to think the re-telling of this historically important event would be closer to the truth and not use pseudonyms or invented characters for melodramatic effect. For a story concerned about the truth, the false notes in the presentation seem contradictory and unfitting.",

            "content": "A couple years back, I watched a movie called *God's Not Dead*. And I hated it. All the Christians in the movie are flawless saints, all the non-Christians in the movie are worse than Hitler, the \"argument\" it gives for the existence of God at the end has more holes than Swiss cheese on a firing range, and it's overall completely biased and manipulative in its message. It remains the most insulting movie I've ever seen.Which is why, when making a film about a topic as sensitive as religion, you have to be careful. If you have a message to send which you see as important, it's so easy to make your side the good guys and the opposing side completely evil. But that's not the case in reality, and that's not the case in Stanley Kramer's 1960 movie *Inherit the Wind*.This story is loosely based on the Scopes Trial of 1925, where a Tennessee schoolteacher got in trouble for teaching evolution in the classroom, which was against state law at the time. It revolves around the trial, the questions it raises about religion and morality and law and government, and its human repercussions. And while it clearly seems to favor the side which believes scientific fact has a place in education, it shows both sides in a fair, sympathetic light. The trial in this movie, as in reality, takes place in a small town where the locals have a deep fundamentalist faith. But, it doesn't treat them as stupid. It shows how their faith gives the people meaning and purpose in life, how they'd naturally feel defensive if anyone challenged it, and how they're susceptible, like everyone, to human blunders. The movie's sympathies clearly lie with the modern viewpoint that public schools shouldn't base their curriculum on a Christian worldview (who would disagree?), but rather than demonizing the other side, it presents them as well-meaning but misguided.The movie also criticizes the other side - namely, any atheist who tries to shatter people's beliefs for no reason. One character, a journalist named E.K. Hornbeck played by Gene Kelly, is a slimy city-slicker and cynical atheist who constantly has a condescending remark about the uneducated townsfolk and the \"fairy tales\" they believe in. He rightfully gets a verbal slap in the face at the end. The defense is Henry Drummond, who's more quiet about his atheism and respects the beliefs of others, only lashing out when the separation of church and state is being undermined, so I identified with him the most. The teacher himself is actually a fairly minor character, but he's shown to be what I think most people would identify with - a Christian who doesn't take the Bible literally and has moments of doubt when times are tough, but takes to heart Jesus' message of love and tolerance. The prosecution is Matthew Harrison Brady, who's probably the most interesting character. A loud-mouthed politician and fundamentalist who's a nationwide celebrity for his preaching, kind of the equivalent of a modern-day televangelist. He's charismatic, eloquent, and larger than life. It's interesting how conservatives and reactionaries tend to rally behind confident men who are great at public speaking and telling people how to think, act, and live. It was William Jennings Bryan back then, and nowadays it's Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson. Still, unlike Ben Shapiro, Brady in this movie has moments of humanity. He has a strong, loving connection with his wife. He's shown to be former best friends with Drummond, making their arguments in the trial all the more gut-wrenching. He's firm and convincing in his arguments for his faith, coming across not as a strawman but as very much how a modern fundamentalist talks. But even he can acknowledge when religion goes too far. In the most chilling moment in the movie, a pastor damns his daughter to Hell for supporting the pro-evolution teacher (her husband), and Brady, visibly shaken, interrupts the sermon, gives a Bible verse which suggests being kind to your family (and gives the movie its title), and tells everyone to go home.One of the main complaints I hear about this movie is that it doesn't really follow the events of the Scopes Trial, and alters them quite a bit. But it never claims to be a portrayal of real events. As a History major, I can say that the real story of the Scopes Trial is a lot more boring than this one, and would've made for a worse movie. The differences were all conscious decisions, not mistakes. Hell, they even changed the names! It's pretty easy to figure out who's who if you know your history, but they clearly wanted just to get at the *spirit* of what the Scopes Trial meant for our culture, without worrying about getting every single tiny little detail right so condescending critics wouldn't point out the inevitable goofs. And yet they did anyway. It seems to me that the changes they made, or rather that the two playwrights made for the play this was based on, was meant to make it a more flowing, meaningful narrative. I support all the changes, and it's really cool to see the parallels and differences. It'd be incredibly easy to go on Wikipedia and fact-check every unimportant detail they got \"wrong\" in this movie. But I'd like to see those smug critics try and type up a better script than this one.Oof. Sorry, I just had to rant after reading some of the 1-star reviews for this movie. Anyway, in the same way *12 Angry Men* should be viewed by anyone who plans to practice law, I think *Inherit the Wind* should be viewed by anyone who's religious, or not religious, or...well, just everyone. It really examines all sides (except for religions other than Christianity, but eh, it was the early 60s) and gives them a fair hearing. It seems that American people have been split into not just into two different parties, but two different worldviews which have entirely different values, speech patterns, role models, and news sources: the more secular, liberal, cosmopolitan worldview, and the more religious, libertarian, patriotic worldview. This movie shows what our country desperately needs right now: real, honest dialogue between both sides. Few movies openly and fairly discuss religion nowadays - and I'm excluding those mass-produced evangelical flicks from the likes of Kirk Cameron, which are meant only to reaffirm the beliefs of people who already believe. Not meant to challenge you or make you think in the least, at *Inherit the Wind* does. My hope is to see another movie like this one in theaters sometime before I die. Our country sorely needs it.",

            "content": "The debate between the two is endless and largely pointless. I, as a pastor, have no difficulty believing in evolution as the process set in motion by God. I have no difficulty in understanding the Genesis story as an attempt on the part of its author to come to terms with the miracle of creation, and what the account affirms is that what exists exists because of God. I start with those comments because it seems to me that a review of this movie needs to state outright the author's own biases.This is a good movie. It's highlighted by powerful performances from Spencer Tracy and Fredric March. It's based on the 1925 \"Scopes Monkey Trial\" in which Tennessee school teacher John Scopes was tried for breaking a state law forbidding the teaching of evolution. The story changes all the names. In the actual trial, 3 time presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan argued for the prosecution, and famed criminal lawyer Clarence Darrow argued for the defence. Here, Tracy plays Henry Drummond (based on Darrow) and March plays Matthew Harrison Brady (based on Jennings.) Dick York has a less central role as Teacher Bertram Cates (based obviously on Scopes.) Why were the names changed? There may have been some legal reasons, but I also suspect it was to allow the writers of the original stage play to play somewhat loose with the actual events of the trial. (Might I suggest therefore that this movie not be taken \"literally?\")The movie is clearly sympathetic to the evolution side of the debate. The prosecutors (and those who supported them) are portrayed in rabid and fanatical terms, the local minister at one point publicly damning his own daughter to hell for supporting Cates. The defence team is shown in a much more sympathetic light, bristling under restrictions placed upon them that forbade the introduction of scientific evidence into the case. March, I thought, was better than Tracy - probably because, at least in the minds of the writers, he had a more interesting character to work with. Brady seemed from the beginning to be a guy living on the edge of reality, desperate to get himself back to centre stage in the public eye but who finds himself increasingly at odds with the changing nature of public opinion. Tracy was good (although at times he looked a bit grizzled, and he seemed older in this movie than he would some years later, for example, in \"Guess Who's Coming To Dinner.\")The movie - which features supporting performances from folks such as Claude Akins as the local minister and Harry Morgan as the judge - remains surprisingly relevant, with the continuing strength of some of the fundamentalist churches in parts of the United States especially and continued debates over the teaching of evolution in schools. It's not a movie that portrays people of faith in a positive light (pretty much all of them are backwards and fanatics) although the character of Cates seems to be the mediator between the two extremes. He doesn't reject faith or the Bible, but reconciles it with evolution, which increasing numbers of Christians today (including myself) are quite capable of doing in a systematical, coherent and completely logical way that in no way undermines their faith. The closing shot of the movie (in which Drummond picks up both the Bible and Darwin's book and carries them out together) does seem to be making that point as well.",

Spencer Tracy and Frederic March are terrific as would be expected and Gene Kelly, in a rare dramatic role, is just as impressive. Great topic, great dialogue, great acting helmed by Kramer make this a truly memorable film. 9/10.",

I happened to see that it was playing on our local PBS station yesterday, not too long after they re-ran the embarrassing, hatchet-job NOVA show about creationism. When I was a kid I loved this movie, it was so timely at the start of the 60s, it stood for the right to express logic over fantasy. But I don't think there's too many Christians around now that would claim the world was created in 7 standard days say 5,000 years ago, and I don't think the Darwinists back then said their beliefs were the only possible view on the subject, so the sides to this debate and the debate itself isn't what it used to be. Forget that as an explanation of animal and human development Darwinism has holes much bigger than creationism, and really has very little scientific evidence for the places people most want to take it. Darwinism is the politically correct un-truth of our time - an agenda you dare not disagree with even if where it's taken makes little sense and has very little scientific support. About as intellectually dishonest as the \"facts\" of this movie and the PBS/ACLU agenda on the subject (see danielpauldavis' excellent IMDb review, right below mine, on that). If someone like John Thomas Scopes were alive today he would be a cause, not for teaching Darwin, but for teaching that creationism might just be one possible explanation for human development. Not exactly the triumph of free speech, logical scientific analysis, and the right to form your own opinion after fair and educated instruction. PRETTY IRONIC, EH?",

            "content": "INHERIT THE WIND, as has been amply pointed out by all the preceding reviews, is inspired by and based on the Scopes monkey trial in 1925. Spencer Tracy plays Henry Drummond (aka Clarence Darrow), the liberal defense attorney for schoolteacher Bert Cates (Dick York) who has been placed on trial by his entire town for daring to teach Darwinism (i.e. evolution theory) in his classroom. Fredric March essays the role of Matthew Harrison Brady (aka William Jennings Bryan), fundamentalist Christian leader brought to the fictional town of Hillsboro (based on the real Dayton, Tennessee) to prosecute the case. What ensues is pure drama--a clash of wills and beliefs unprecedented onscreen, with Drummond as the undeniable hero for whom the audience is expected to have great sympathy, as he struggles in the face of the bigotry of the court and the people: the judge (Harry Morgan) refuses to allow Drummond to bring in scientific evidence, which damns his case from the outset; the people of Hillsboro hold night marches through the streets, burning effigies of Cates and Drummond... a more frightening lynch mob can hardly be imagined. Although Brady does ultimately come off as the villain of the film, this judgement does not come unqualified. What the film strives very hard to prove, a moral that gets a little lost in the fierce arguments about religion and the apparently clashing theories of creation and evolution, is that everyone has a right to be different. What matters is the sanctity of the individual mind, which includes the right to reason, the right to think, the right to believe, the right to be different but also, most importantly the right to be wrong. The film is *not* preaching about the rights and wrongs of Darwinism. In fact, very tellingly, the audience is not informed about the specifics of the theory, just as the jury and the townsfolk in the film aren't. It doesn't matter. The villain here is bigotry, the refusal to allow people the rights earlier enumerated. Therefore it is most important that Brady should come off as a human being, one with just as many flaws as the next person. This the writers try very hard to do in creating, for example, the rocking chair scene between Drummond and Brady--it becomes evident that their friendship goes back several decades, that they have the greatest respect for each other as people, even if not for each other's beliefs and causes. It is Brady's refusal to examine his own beliefs that leads him into bigotry, but he is not the only person guilty of this--the townsfolk, of course, are the same way, with Reverend Jeremiah Brown (Claude Akins) being the best example. Even his daughter Rachel (Donna Anderson), who is engaged to Bert, must struggle with Bert's need to be different; the cynical E.K. Hornbeck (Gene Kelly) spends most of the film making rude asides about Brady, and is himself revealed to be closed to the possibility that Brady is a good man, despite his beliefs. The moral of the story preached here is one of tolerance, a keystone of the American constitution--*this* is what is on trial, not the rightness of wrongness of either Darwin or the Holy Scriptures. To this effect, the film brings together the considerable acting talents of Spencer Tracy, Fredric March and Gene Kelly. The supporting cast is excellent, but in the end, it all comes down to those two giants of the silver screen, Tracy and March, and Kelly's right and ability to stand right next to the best of them and not be stereotyped as merely a musical star. March brings to life the larger-than-life Matt Brady, with his overbearing attitude and loud confidence captured in a portrayal that still somehow wrings sympathy from the heart. His final desperation in the courtroom, as he struggles to deliver his prepared summation, is harrowing--the look etched on Spencer Tracy's face, one of immeasurable sorrow and horror, perhaps best encapsulates one's reaction to Brady's final moments. March truly turns in an amazing performance in a role that isn't written too sympathetically. Perhaps that's part of the point--however domineering a person might appear, however wrongheaded and obstinate and misguidedly confident (if at all), he is still a person, with goals, beliefs, and a right to hold those ideas sacred. One cannot judge by appearances.Gene Kelly, as well, does a great job with his role as the cynical reporter from the Baltimore Herald. In the end one does realise that Hornbeck's posturing and strutting are almost all show; he did bring Drummond in to fight a cause he believed in, and not just to watch the circus melee that he knew would ensue. Hornbeck's final speech to Drummond--\"You're wrong, Henry. You'll be there. You're the type. Who else would defend my right to be lonely?\"--is wonderfully delivered, even after Drummond dresses him down. One actually believes Kelly when he says, \"I may be rancid butter, but at least I'm on your side of the bread.\" This film is a hint at what Kelly could have done in dramatic roles if he hadn't been so stereotyped as just a hoofer. Much as Kelly and March do their best to steal the show, however, the show ultimately belongs to Spencer Tracy. One possibly does not understand the meaning of screen presence until one has seen Tracy in a film displaying his formidable acting skill. Even when he isn't talking, it is almost impossible to take one's eyes off Tracy when he's included in the frame. He *is* his character, and perhaps only Tracy could really pull off the role and make it believable. Drummond is too obviously written as the hero of the film; Tracy manages to make him likeable and not a crusader. Drummond is crusty and a needler when played by Tracy, not smarmy and over-confident. Just as special effects and CGI were never needed to create movie magic in the Golden Age, all one needs is that final shot of Tracy--walking down the courtroom aisle--to see him as a soldier for his cause, a hero not because he has fought the winning battle, but because his message is one you feel he will fight for always, no matter how painful or lonely it gets.\nThis film is worth watching for the performances alone, both driven and certainly some of the best ever committed to film. Its underlying message of tolerance is admirable as well. But, in the end, whether you agree with its characters, what matters the most is that this is a film that makes you think. It engages you on an intellectual level, using dialogue and arguments that--even if flawed--make you pay attention. (To be honest, Drummond's case *is* weak--he has no evidence and all he can do is prove that one should have the right and ability to think through what one believes. Similarly, one has the right *not* to do so... and this defence probably isn't the strongest that could be put forward.) The most valuable thing about INHERIT THE WIND, then, is one's inability to be complacent while watching it. This is film-making at its finest, and this is certainly a fine (though imperfect) film.",

            "content": "\"He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind; And the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.\" - Proverbs 11:29 Video stores in Kansas must have burned their copies of \"Inherit The Wind\". (Those who don't know history are destined to repeat it.) Back when fundamentalist Christians used to carpet-hymn the streets and gather at grassy knolls to filibuster hellfire (at least, that's how dem ignint folks does it in this movie), the thorny battle of Evolution versus Creation was met in Tennessee at the infamous \"Scopes Monkey Trial\" of 1925. Based on the fracas of that trial and its attendant sociopolitical shockwaves, \"Inherit The Wind\" displays a kinetic potential, but falters due to misapprehension of its own subject matter, and characters rendered in hyperbole.It's amusing to note that all the character names of the principals in the movie resonate rhythmically with their real-world counterparts, hence Spencer Tracy plays lawyer Henry Drummond (read Clarence Darrow), Fredric March is fundamentalist Mathew Harrison Brady (read William Jennings Bryan), Gene Kelly is reporter E.K. Hornbeck (read H.L. Mencken) and Dick York (forever stereotyped as \"the original Darrin\") is schoolteacher Bertram T. Cates (read John T. Scopes).Drummond is summoned to a small Tennessee town to defend schoolteacher Cates for teaching outlawed Evolution Theory, facing off against Brady in a trial which embodied a lot more than just a legal infraction. At the time of the real-life trial, nothing less than the future of intelligent thought was at stake.In an attempt to test the limits of the newly-instated, controversial Butler Act (of March 1925, \"\u0085prohibiting the teaching of the Evolution Theory in all the Universities, Normals and all other public schools of Tennessee\u0085and to provide penalties for the violations thereof\u0085\"), the American Civil Liberties Union proposed a \"willing scapegoat\" to undergo prosecution. John T. Scopes stepped forward as that scapegoat, though this aspect was not made clear in the movie, where we are simply shown Cates (the ad hoc Scopes) being arrested during his biology lesson, seemingly for no reason other than the town being a bunch of Jesus freaks.Though it is sincere in its debunking of Creationist dumbo-jumbo, the movie proves itself more of an entertaining diversion than an historical document whereby, in an artful dodge, the world-girdling, bio-environmental process that it rallies for \u0096 Evolution itself \u0096 is never explained! By 1960, Evolution was generally accepted as doctrine, so the word \"Evolutionist\" is used in the movie's context merely to represent Intellectuals, or Forward-Thinkers, whilst the word \"Creationists\" represents the Close-Minded contingent.One stuttering schoolboy expounds on an unintelligible version of the process of Evolution, while subpoenaed \"experts\" are denied their testimony by the court - obviously to avoid bogging the movie with technicalities and esoteric jargon - yet isn't this \"dumbing down\" omission exactly what this movie is against? To cry out against ignorance and then to pander to it by *not educating* is the height of hypocrisy, at least from an Intellectualist's point of view. Here the movie takes a hit in the Intellectual *cahonnes* \u0096 if only the Fundamentalists were smart enough to see it that way. The irony is that they can't, and that even if they *did*, to rail against this movie for \"keeping them ignorant\" must necessarily grant an admission of ignorance in the first place \u0096 a shortcoming which they feel their god has cured them of\u0085 There are no reasons given for being supportive of either camp \u0096 you come into this movie as either cognizant of Evolutionary theory or an Ignoramus who believes in talking snakes. And you'll probably go out the same way...The movie leans so heavily in favor of Evolutionists (rendering Creationists as blathering, Bible-bent fanatics) that in stacking the deck so obviously, it makes for a less convincing argument *for* Evolution! Therefore, any \"logic\" that Drummond displays in the courtroom is cursory at best, because we know the crazy-eyed Jesus-freak Brady is sure to put his foot in his mouth - because the script will make it so! The smart Evolutionists in the movie will gladden their equivalents in the audience and the exaggerated hellfire-filibustering Creationists in the movie will either gladden the fanatic Bible-thumpers in the audience or cause them to be even more averse to the Evolutionists' message due to the unfair hyperbole.As usual, we're ALL preaching to our respective choirs.As every generation must face its own \"Scopes Monkey Trial\" (Kansas: the lights are on, but the Intelligent Designer ain't home), stupidity will never go out of fashion. Thus, neither will this movie.Performances by Tracy and March are passionate, if not a tad over-acted, with Gene Kelly scathingly loquacious in one of his rare dramatic roles. While Darrin Stevens perfects that look of a man who has just seen a fruity Uncle Arthur appear in his living room with a bathing suit on.As in the real Scopes trial, the Evolutionist ultimately loses the case legally, but wins intellectually, promoting the ideal of Scientific Method over blind faith, with Drummond intoning, \"An idea is a greater monument than a cathedral, and the advance of man's knowledge is a greater miracle than all the sticks turned to snakes or the parting of the waters.\" Tell that to Kansas.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",

I was delighted to read in another review that the trial dialog is almost verbatim from the transcripts at the real Scopes trial. In fact, we were taping this from TV at home one time & only got the movie from the beginning of the trial. We call this the short version since we were later able to record the movie in it's entirety. What's interesting about that, is that the movie is maybe more impressive without all the initial pontificating. The sparks between Drummond and Brady are what really has meaning in the movie as well as implications to all teachers and anyone wishing to impart knowledge. As someone once said, \"Stand up for your opinions, but do not believe that they contain the whole truth, or the only truth.\" This movie is about tolerance and the search for knowledge.

            "content": "This has long been one of my favorite films because in it, Spencer Tracy and Frederic March provide an acting lesson that ever actor ought to watch. For both of them, it is a tour de force. I chose this time to write a review of the film because I am just concluding reading the new biography of Spencer Tracy.It is so easy to forget the beginning of the film once you get into the courtroom scenes. But, to Stanley Kramer's credit, the nearly half hour of the film before Tracy's entrance is extremely well done with a great deal of delightful detail regarding what the atmosphere may have been like surrounding the real Scopes Monkey Trial.Watching Spencer Tracy is this film is simply mind boggling. You do have to get past how quickly Tracy had aged (and how fat he had gotten) in a very short time...and it wasn't just makeup. But he commands your full attention when he is on the screen. For me, at least, this is his finest performance in a long and distinguished career.If Spencer Tracy were not in the film, great credit would have gone to Fredric March...not always a favorite of mine, but truly superb in this film. And, it's amazing how much he looked like William Jennings Bryant...the real lawyer in the trail.If there's a weak performance in this film, I can't find it. Well, sometimes the cynicism of the newspaper reporter played by Gene Kelly gets to be a bit too much, but he redeems himself fully in the next to the last scene of the film.Florence Eldridge, who plays Fredric March's wife in the film was actually Fredric March's wife; and her performance here is masterful -- balancing love for her husband with friendship for the opposition (Tracy's character). Too bad Dick York ever got involved in \"Bewitched\", because here he really shined in his role as the troubled school teacher who dared teach evolution. Donna Anderson plays the role of the biology teacher's girlfriend very well, and has two powerful scenes -- one against her father, the minister, and the other in a scene with Fredric March. Harry Morgan is very good as the judge, and Claude Akins is surprisingly superb as the fundamentalist minister.The most powerful scene in the film is the one where Tracy calls March to testify! And that really did happen in the real trial, although that testimony lasted about 2 hours, rather than 10 minutes. But it is the most superb acting I have ever seen.This is a GREAT film. I award it a \"9\"! And it belongs on your DVD shelf!",

The Atheist teacher who indoctrinates his students with Atheism & Evolution is portrayed as a hero and genius, as are all the other Atheists/Evolutionists in the movie. Inherit the Wind urges all it's viewers to take these sick 'lessons' to heart in real-life and hate & suppress Christians and any anyone who refuses to agree that Atheism and/or Evolution is correct and must be forced down everyone's throat against their will in schools.In reality, the theory of evolution is not fact, never has been fact, and never will be fact. If anyone thinks Evolution is correct, that is only an *opinion.* The way Inherit the Wind serves as pro-Evolution propaganda is a disgrace and slap in the face to film-making, God, Christianity, and mankind as a species.The fact that this movie and play is sometimes served up to unwitting students as a mandatory part of their public education is nothing short of disgusting! They want to brainwash the youths to hate Christianity and believe in Evolution, just like the \"heroes\" of the movie and play do. This is *not* educational, it's disgusting propaganda in it's worst form.Inherit the Wind has the bald-faced *gall* to have a line spoken in the movie which says anyone who doesn't believe in Atheism & Evolution is dead.

Could a movie *possibly* be any more disgusting and shameful propaganda? No, no it can't.\"Inherit the Wind\" is a phrase taken directly from the Bible - a Holy Book which the movie bashes wickedly as much as it possibly can. The filmmakers/playwrights might have thought it was \"funny\" to title their movie after the words in the Bible, only to then viciously bash the Bible with the movie. It is doubtful though, that they *still* found it funny after their lives on Earth and run their natural course, and they came face to face with the God who they were so keen to bash and fight against by making this movie during their fleeting time on Earth. Inherit the Wind was made in 1960. It's now 2008. Using common sense, it's easy to figure out where the filmmakers/playwrights are now. And it's *not* in a happy place with a smile on their face for bashing God & Christianity in their brief moment on Earth when it was \"funny\" to do so.Guess in the end, it goes to show that contrary to what Inherit the Wind claims, it's not those who believe in God and reject Evolution who are brain-dead after all.",

            "content": "The fireworks had really started in 1925 when high-school teacher John Scopes was arrested for teaching evolution in Dayton, Tennessee. The \"monkey\" trial that followed attracted national attention. With crusading lawyer Clarence Darrow defending Scopes in the name of intellectual freedom and one-time presidential candidate William Jennings Bryant assisting the prosecution in the name of Christian Fundamentalism, it became the true trial of the 20th century, a battle for the hearts and minds of the nation.For the film version of Inherit the Wind, Kramer only had two choices for the leads, Spencer Tracy and Fredric March. He had no problem convincing the latter. March had scored an Oscar\u00ae nomination for his performance in the film version of Death of a Salesman, which Kramer had produced in 1951. Tracy was another matter. The veteran actor had been in poor health and hadn't made a film in two years. But he was flattered at the offer, saying, \"I might as well do it. Nobody else wants me.\" When he protested that he might not have the energy for the role, Kramer assured him that he would shoot around his problems, even guaranteeing him a two-hour lunch break each day.The first day of shooting, however, Tracy and Kramer faced off. The director asked for a second take because Tracy had mumbled the end of his line. Tracy stared at him for ten seconds, then said, \"Mister Kramer, it has taken me just about 40 years to learn to read a line that way. Now do you want some college kid from UCLA to come over here and do this? Just say so, and we can arrange it.\" Kramer stared back for what seemed an eternity, and then calmly said, \"Well, OK Spence, can we do another take?\" and his star agreed. The two became close friends after that, and Tracy would make three more films with Kramer.Tracy and March were great admirers of each other's work, but that didn't stop either from trying to upstage the other. March would fuss with his props during Tracy's lines, while Tracy would react to March in ways that drew the camera to him. But each knew the acting duel perfectly reflected the courtroom battle between their characters. And the challenge lifted both to new heights. As word of their performances got out, the set began filling with visitors eager to watch the two masters at work. During one courtroom scene, Tracy delivered a speech so effectively the onlookers began applauding before March could finish the take. In another exchange, the two delivered their increasingly heated dialogue so convincingly that Kramer was convinced they would never speak to each other again. But when it was over, March said, \"You played the scene magnificently,\" and Tracy replied, \"That's because you fed me my lines magnificently.\"Inherit the Wind opened to glowing reviews, but ran into problems around the country, where theatres showing the film were picketed by religious fundamentalists convinced the picture was \"anti-God.\" Fearing more protests, the distributor, United Artists, cut back its advertising budget to nearly nothing. Kramer had to tour the nation on his own in a futile attempt to drum up box office. Yet the film was well enough liked in Hollywood to garner Oscar\u00c6 nominations for Tracy, the screenplay, the cinematography and the editing, all of which had helped ensure that this particular courtroom drama would be anything but static.",

WIND is especially harmful because so many people think it's a true story where only the names have been changed. But the actual Scopes Trial did not happen as WIND portrays it; in particular, the actions of WIND's \"religious villains\" are not based on reality whatsoever. People often mention the Scopes Trial to make a point, thinking WIND is an accurate account of it, but its actual events would not support their viewpoint at all. What the real trial mainly showed is the extent to which some -- in this case, those who used Scopes and Darrow -- will play dirty to achieve their end.There's no telling how many seeds of bigotry WIND, whether as a movie or a play, has sown. No doubt it has contributed to the damage that EXPELLED has begun to try to clean up. If we really want to oppose works of fiction that promote intolerance, WIND should be at the top of the list.

Please skip this review if you want to avoid this, but know I think you should definitely see this brilliant movie!Inherit the Wind is one of the finest religious-themed movies ever made. I just watched it for the 2nd time in my life today on TCM, and it's even better the second time!The movie, which derives it's name from Proverbs 11:29(\"He who causes trouble on his family will only inherit the wind\"), is a fictional retelling of the Scopes Trial from 1928, where a high school teacher was arrested for teaching Darwinian evolution against Tennessee state law.There are many objectors to this movie due to the fact that the movie fudges many of the actual historical facts. Well, was there a nude drawing that took place on the Titanic? Did Pocahontas have a romance with John Smith and \"paint with all the colors of the wind?\"No, and yet Titanic and Pocahontas are both beloved movies! While I am against biblical inaccuracies, I have no issues with that done with histories since the spirit of such stories still remain.In the courtroom, the intended purpose is to decide if the teacher should go to jail for teaching kids of a religious town \"that man descended from a low order of animals\" as the police put it, or could there be more to the Earth's formation than just the beginning of Genesis?Many aspects of both sides are debated in court. Henry Drummond, the evolutionist defending the side, has arguments such as the teacher has a right to think bout what he wants to believe, there is geological evidence for evolution, etc.Creationism is defended by Matthew Harrison Brady, a politician who refuses to even consider a belief against biblical theology. His main argument is that the Bible is true, and it's correct simply because he says so. He is so stubborn in his position, he even directly states that he would never even read Darwin's book On The Origin of Species.So both sides fight like cats and dogs, until an official position on the case can be concluded.My favorite scene is an argument where Drummond actually puts Brady on trial as a witness. He asks him if events in the Bible can really occur-can Jonah be swallowed by a big fish and live? Can Joshua make the sun stand still and not affect astrological function? If the Bible says one event of creation took a day-can it be a full 24 hour day if the sun was not made until day 3?Brady then realizes that there may be a reason for other ideas of the beginning of time...which he finds upsetting.The movie ends with Drummond smacking a Bible and Origin of Species together. There are different interpretations of what this means, I personally think it means that evolution and Biblical creationism will always be believed by different people.As a creationist myself, I really take this to heart. I will always believe in creation, but as Brady learns, maybe there is a reason to at least listen to the other side. We get into trouble otherwise. And \"he who causes trouble on his family will only inherit the wind.\"Final verdict: This is the best courtroom drama of all time and a must see for anyone!",

It deals with the subject of evolution being taught in schools. The plot centers on the trial of a man who has broken the law by teaching his students about Darwin's theory of evolution, which it is illegal to do in the town where the story is set(Hillsboro). Spencer Tracy and Frederic March play the main attorneys involved in the trial, with Gene Kelly as a cynical newspaperman. It seems that the films main purpose was to denounce the ideas of the then rampant McCarthyism the U.S. found itself being run by. The film gives the impression that everybody should be allowed to have their own beliefs and be able to express themselves freely. This is a thoroughly enjoyable film, maybe not up there with 12 Angry Men or To Kill A Mockingbird as far as courtroom dramas go but certainly a powerful tale.",

In reality, it was simply a question of education versus bigotry where all the educated people were in full agreement regardless of religious beliefs. The movie does very well to portray that simple pursuit of truth in a way that pits the audience against both the bigoted pseudo-religious and the bigoted atheist (Kelly/the reporter), while at the same time making the truth obvious to anyone willing to hear it, religious or not.",

            "content": "Not many people know this, but Stanley Kramer did NOT direct this movie. His name is on the film, but that was merely a marketing ploy drummed up by the executives at United Artists. Inherit the Wind was actually the freshman outing by little known director and circus act promoter J. Worthington \"Honest John\" Foulfellow. You may know him better as the fox from the Disney movie Pinocchio (1940). Well, apparently one of the producers ran into Foulfellow at Shwab's drug store and, being the sly fox that he is, he convinced U/A to let him direct this film. Initial testing showed that people had an aversion to seeing a film directed by an animated fox, so Kramer's name was added as director.With this is mind, it is much easier to enjoy the movie Inherit the Wind, taking it as a window into the cunning mind of a erudite swindler. At face value, one might consider the cartoonish behavior of the characters in this movie to be absurd, but when you realize Inherit the Wind was directed by a cartoon character, the movie suddenly makes perfect sense. As I understand it, the entire cast was originally supposed to be played by animated personalities, but when Bugs Bunny was held up by his contract at Warner Bros., Spencer Tracy was brought in to play the Henry Drummond role, and the decision was made to go with a human cast. I think this was a good choice. It gives the movie a much more ironic and paradoxical feel. Note the torch wielding peasants that want to lynch the \"free thinking\" teacher and picture a scene from Foghorn Leghorn and the barnyard dog, and you get the picture. To me, the sheer genius of Honest John's work are the empirical aesthetic devices he employs to counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor. The movie is obviously mocking propaganda and how gullible those who think they are smarter than others can become. Yet if you are not careful, you will fall precisely into that trap, intuitively thinking the dialog is hack and the characters are clich\u00e9 and formulaic. Another brilliant trap set by Foulfellow is the lack of historic accuracy in the film, as if to say, \"The very premise this film is built upon is hype\". Indeed, if one is not careful one can even walk away from this film thinking it completely sucks. If that be the case, all I can say is I pity you, you silly gullible philistine.",

            "content": "I am a film buff and I love old movies. Movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey, Citizen Kane, and My Fair Lady all make my top 10 favorite movies, so note that I am not a hater of the classics. Far from it, I gravitate towards them.More importantly, I am also a Christian. I will not express my views on Creation vs. Evolution directly, although my position will be clear by the end with a couple of important points.Whatever side you are on though, Inherit The Wind is not a good movie, despite being considered a classic. I'm with the other 1 star reviewers here.I once loved Inherit The Wind. After all, it is a movie about Creation vs. Evolution (a topic that intrigues me) and it's from 1960. With its wonderful acting and well done filmmaking on top of the subject matter, I thought it was the great movie that it's hailed as. Upon research, I heavily changed my mind.Inherit The Wind is a false interpretation of the Scopes Trial. The 1925 court case was centered on a teacher who subbed in a Tennessee classroom at a time when it was illegal by state law to teach Darwinian evolution. He did not teach the theory, but the textbook that he used did, and the people who wanted creationism gone from the school thought that was enough for a court case.This movie, based on a play, changes the plot to a teacher deliberately teaching evolution to rebel against a law that bans evolutionary teaching. Okay, that's alright. Most movies based on true stories fudge facts for cinematic interest. That's a small change right?Well, it keeps going. What my main focus will be is how creationist Christians are portrayed in this movie. A politician named Matthew Harrison Brady, who is a devout Christian, arrives prideful as the town marches around him, singing Old Time Religion. In reality, the real Brady (named Bryan in real life) was welcomed greatly by the community, but not in such a pompous way.This is not the only scene like this. One time, while the teacher is in jail (a false occurrence, as Scopes never spent a minute in jail), the town parades at the jail, singing to the tune of The Battle Hymn of the Republic, a pro-North song (in the South, mind you.) To this tune, they sing about hanging the teacher to a sour apple tree for rejecting Genesis.In another scene, a Reverend Jeremiah Brown condemns the teacher at a meeting and says that he is doomed for hell. Later in the movie, his daughter testifies in court that the teacher (her fianc\u00e9) left the church because Brown said an unbaptized child who died is in hell. Some preacher, huh? And, by the way, no preacher like Brown was around in this era and setting in 1925, he is completely made up for the movie.In the most famous and yet most demonizing scene, Brady is put on trial by Henry Drummond, Spencer Tracy's character. In real life, his name was Clarence Darrow.Henry asks Matthew many questions about The Bible. Who did Cain marry? How did the planets not crash when Joshua made the sun stand still? How could Jonah be swallowed by a whale and be vomited alive? Were the first 3 days of creation literal days without a sun?Any literist Christian who is mature enough in their faith could answer those- Cain married his sister, as no other woman was available. Genetic issues were not a risk yet- after all Adam married his rib.If God is all powerful, enough to become man, die for us, and rise again, He is powerful enough to let a man live after being in a whale and He can control the physics of the universe. (A point Brady makes but is mocked for.)At the end of the scene, Brady is humiliated, and the evolution side earns a bonus point. Look up this testimony in real life, and you'll see how much of this was twisted. Darrow actually asked by mistake if Jonah swallowed a whale and corrected himself immediately (a line that the movie omits), and he got Bryan to consider theistic evolution. A flawed theology, but that's another topic.This scene particularly, and the other scenes I have named (among others) completely mock Christianity and those who hold God as our Creator. Why I ever praised this movie is beyond me. As other 1/10 star reviews have mentioned, Inherit The Wind is simply propaganda. More like Inherit The Lies, huh?Speaking of the title, Inherit The Wind is named after a verse Brady quotes in the Jeremiah Brown scene- Proverbs 11:29: \"He who troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind.\" Drummond quotes this at the end, and for simply recalling a verse quoted earlier, Gene Kelly calls him: \"The Atheist Who Believes In God.\" Yes, he believes in God because he recalled a Bible verse.The movie ends with Drummond holding The Bible in one hand, and The Origin of Species in the other. He smacks them together, and walks out of the courtroom as Old Time Religion plays again. This can be interpreted in a few ways, but it appears that Drummond has reconciled Darwin and Genesis, implying that both can co-exist.Again, that's bad theology, but that aside, that's appalling. Inherit The Wind spends 2 hours making fools out of Christians, and then uses a verse from the book they value most to...make a moral out of the story? You've GOT to be kidding me!Oddly enough, in 2014 a movie came out called God's Not Dead. It made Christians look good and atheists look like villains. It is rightfully deemed as propaganda, and yet this movie, which does the opposite in its portrayals, is highly praised. How bizarre.Inherit The Wind is sometimes used in schools to teach about the Scopes Trial. One class in my high school read the play and saw the 1999 TV adaptation with Jack Lemmon and George C. Scott. I'm actually glad I was put in regular English instead.I could write much more, but simply put, Inherit The Wind is a dangerous movie with lies woven in. And yet it's hailed as great cinema and used in schools.Regardless of if your views on creation and evolution, don't see Inherit The Wind. I have seen both the 1960 and the 1999 versions a couple of times and I don't intend to do so again, unless it's to expose these lies to someone.There's people who want Gone With The Wind banned for glorifying slavery. While it's not quite politically correct, it at least doesn't make fools out of slaves, nor their masters. Gone With The Wind is historically sound, Inherit The Wind is not. People say ban Gone With The Wind, but I say gone with Inherit The Wind.Reverse Recommendations: For a better evolution themed movie about faith and science, see Creation. For a more historically sound Scopes Trial movie, see Alleged.",

I saw it a long time ago and thought it very powerful and think it's still the best version that I recall. It's in glorious black and white in which form it should stay.Frederic March even looks a lot like William Jennings Bryan and Spencer Tracy looks exactly like Spencer Tracy and not Clarence Darrow but they are both believable in their parts. Those who thought Frederic was too over-the-top have to remember that Bryan was a notable orator and this was the 1920s when that larger-than-life style was still fashionable. Again, Bryan died, I think, 5 days after the trial (yes, from overeating.) and not in the courtroom as presented here for the sake of the drama. I was amused to see that Dick York, as the Scopes character Bertram Cates, was playing a similar character to Darren whom he later played on \"Bewitched\"; in both, he was alternately harassed and angry. But he played it well here as he did later on in the series. But, if I remember correctly, the trial was originally set up as a test case by a local Dayton, Tennessee newspaper and Scopes was prepared to be arrested.Florence Eldridge of course was March's real-life wife and she also played his wife in this film and did it very well. Gene Kelly was quite good as the H. L. Mencken character, Hornbeck, though I thought Darren McGavin in the remake was marginally better. I don't know that the real \"Sage of Baltimore\" was quite that sleazy but the characterization is acceptable, I think, in the dramatic context.The supporting cast was also excellent and Leslie Uggams added a lot to the film singing \"That Old-Time Religion\" at the beginning and \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" at the end.9 out of 10.",

            "content": "For some 75 years, the over-conservative scientific community left an issue unresolved - the legality of teaching scientific truth.Darwin was himself largely untrammelled by the conflict between scientific revelation and religious dogma. The revolution appeared to have been very much a velvet one. It wasn't until the mid 1920's that the ascendancy of evolution over creation would finally be tested in court.'Inherit The Wind' offers an excellent all-round presentation of the ambiguity and hypocrisy of human nature. Many conflicting issues are at stake. There's the status of religion (and its appointed spokespersons) as well as interpretation of state law. But there's much more; individual and cultural credibility, for one thing, and not least the chance to make a fast buck.Spencer Tracy is on cracking form as advocate for the defence. But songster Gene Kelly also excels in a rare straight role as a cynical journalist out to make his name. Fredric March makes the case for the prosecution. Donna Anderson - who also featured in Stanley Kramer's 'On The Beach' - turns in another good performance as a young woman with divided loyalties. They, and many others, spar away with a lively and imaginative script that is the primary entertainment in this movie. It's a work that benefits those who can listen and think.The issue here, ultimately, is not whether Darwinian evolution is true or false, but whether it is legal to teach it in Tennessee. It isn't - and the miscreant teacher is duly found guilty.A good courtroom drama is always entertaining, and this work by Kramer simmers away nicely. My only grumble is the way in which March's character is presented as someone on the threshold of a nervous breakdown. The presentation has more than a hint of pro-evolution prejudice and I think greater latitude should have been afforded to the advocates of creationism, bearing in mind that theirs was a lost cause. This would have given a more detailed analysis and provided further subtle discussion. The deliberate enfeebling of the prosecution both in body and mind rather spoilt the conclusion for me. Otherwise it's a sterling effort and well worth a watch, regarding a battle that is even today far from won.",

I didn't require my children to go to church, read the\nBible, or say prayers. I believe faith is a matter of experience with God, not adhering to man-made religion.I believe in \"evolution\" since nature herself teaches this to us. Everything is in a constant state of\nchange, from evolution and devolution, but all things are in motion whether we see them or not.Faith is not something that anyone can detect with our senses. There is no width, mass, or electrons\nby which we can measure the spiritual world. The \"experience\" of faith is outside our physical world\nso we waste time arguing over it.Having said all of that ... I can't watch anyone's beliefs be beat up because they don't fit with common\nopinion, regardless of the empirical arguments for or against. This film takes a ham-handed and smug\nstick to those peoples of faith everywhere.Here's my breakdown:STORY:\nThe story could have been developed, handled, and executed with a far more measured approach. But\nsome person (s) had an ax to grind and a belief system to tear down. The irony is that our nation was\nfounded on the belief and law of separation of church and state, AND that all are free to live and practice\ntheir faith freely.But this is bashing, not a well-balanced argument against narrow-mindedness. Balance would be to show\nwhy people adhere to religion (or faith) in addition to man's ability to manipulate matter. So I think this was\na poor, heavily biased answer to films like \"The Ten Commandments\" (1956) of that era. Too bad.ACTING:\nSpencer Tracy is what drove people to this film, along with some blood lust in bringing down the simple\nfaith that many rest on. But as an actor, he is so often just smug, and that arrogance left me offended.Aside from him, the acting here is mediocre, and largely because the cast are almost entirely TV-people.Yes, no doubt March brought some followers, but he didn't command ticket sales like Tracy.TEMPO:\nFine, but gets bogged down in pushing \"Old Time Religion\" in your face that it gets old (no pun)CINEMATOGRAPHY:\nOKDIRECTING / WRITING:\nDirector: Kramer has directed only one film I liked \"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner\" (1967). Otherwise, it looks\nlike he's more of a producer (by 2x) than a director. Here he does both, which suggests to me that either he:\n1) Wanted complete control, and / or 2) No one else wanted to produce it. Dunno.Writers: Not surprisingly, there's a lot of TV writing /tenor here. Across the three writers I see only one film I could\nrecommend: \"The Train\" (1964) with Burt Lancaster. It's quite good.Is it a good film? That depends. If you don't mind made-for-TV feel and a heavy beating on people of faith, then it's OK.Should you watch this once?

            "content": "Most filmmakers content themselves with implied-level ideas; these are suitable to adventures and comedies only. Satire and drama require more; which is one reason why important U.S. made dramas have always been so very hard to find. \"Inherit the Wind\", fictionalized biography of the 1920s Tennessee Scopes \"Monkey\" Trial, draws heavily on the actually testimony; but the authors of the play on which the film was based, Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee and scenarists Nedrick Young and Harold Jacob Smith added characters with allegorical significance. What was never at stake in that trial, revolving about a teacher's curriculum in a high school biology course, was the ultimate correctness of the secular theory (involving evolutionary change in human ancestry) being taught. What was at stake was the secular versus the theocratic basis of men's association into governed states. The two underlying themes of the film are the false belief that religion is a worldly, practical morality in secular life--since Christ said, \"My kingdom is not of this world\" and that education ought to be coercive and public-collective in nature, even though its avowed purpose in an American context is to teach individuals to think for themselves using category-level definitions of real space-time entities and man-made additions to that Earth's store. The contest depicted is for the minds of a jury chosen to judge one Bertram Cates; the lawyers are Matthew Harrison Brady, famed orator and public religionist espousing literal interpretation of the \"bible\", and Henry Drummond, champion of secular rights against institutional totalitarianism's \"tsars\". That these characters are based in part on William Jennings Bryan and Clarence Darrow is largely irrelevant in this context; what matters is \"who gets to think--the state's infallibility-claiming dictators, religious or not, or each man.\" The added character of E.K. Horneck, cynical reporter, allowed the authors after the trial to show why Hornbeck's desire to prevent religious thinking, with which he does not agree, is as bad or worse than Brady's desire to force HIS brand of thought onto others. It's force that is wrong; and it is the introduction of otherworldist speculation and dictatorship into secular lives under an irresponsible government that poisons the state; in the year 2005 we have witnessed what such a warping of governmental purpose can do. The trial proceeds with a noisy group of marchers lynching of Drummond in effigy, attempts to forbid the introduction of scientific material, and Drummond's eliciting from his opposing counsel that he believes the Earth was created on an exact day 4000 years ago--creationism turned to dogma. This is what Brady wanted taught to students--Bishop Usher's nonsense--creationism.,. The trial ends with a light fine for Cates, but no clear triumph. As Drummond notes, what Brady represents is bigotry--ever busy, always needing to be fed. The film was always about freedom of the individual to think for himself; which is why so good-hearted a man as Brady at the end cannot stand that he will not be the only voice heard, listened to. What is wrong with totalitarianism, religious or otherwise, the film shows us, is that it has no turn-off switch; that absolute power corrupts categorically those who practice its tenets. The production is in B/W as befits dramatic work; and it has very dense imagery too. Stanley Kramer directed, with cinematography by Ernest Laszlo and a striking production design by Rudolph Sternad. Strong music was supplied by Ernest Gold and Bud Westmore did the difficult makeup. The entire cast is above average, including Spencer Tracy whose accent is not quite up to classical work; but he is at his most powerful in this important role. As Brady, classical actor Frederic March wears a bald-head wig, and pulls out all the stops to produce a nuanced and memorable character, one who turns into a caricature only because his ideas are unrealistic, his pretensions to speak for his god puerile. As Bertram Cates, Dick York is his usual charming self; Donna Anderson as his wife is very good in the last major rule she was ever permitted to play. Henry Morgan is intelligent as the Judge in the case, Gene Kelly adequate as the obnoxious Hornbeck. Other who shone in the cast included Florence Eldridge, March's wife, as Brady's wife, Claude Akins, Noah Beery Jr;, Eliot Reid, Jimmy Boyd, Paul Hartman, Norman Fell and Ray Teal. Those whose view of reality is surreal will see the real as wrong; and those whose view of reality is real will be able to see wrong views for the surreality they are; this film is well-remembered and appreciated today, but only by those who saw in it a defense of the individual's right to think, speak, evaluate and advocate truths that he claimed would work in a secular world. Others who saw it as something else missed its point entirely; and they wish it, and \"The Fountainhead\" and other such films would just go away. This is by my lights a very-fine achievement, especially as a postscript to the HUAC fiasco of the early late 1940s and 1950s. Its message is clear: to equate the study of ideas with their espousal and freedom of speech with crime is UnAmerican. he who troubleth his own house shall \"inherit the wind\".",

This film will be seen by our future generation for historical reasons like we watch tales of Galileo and Joan of Arc. The film is based on a true incident and is close to the facts. A lot has been said and a lot is known so I will say a few things. I think only a country like America has the guts to fight a case like that in a courtroom and then make a play out of it then make a film and also nominate it for Academy Awards. Of course the film, dialogs and actors are entertaining but more important is that people found this movie entertaining. Nobody burnt theaters or effigies.You cant imagine Pakistan, Iraq, Germany or even France to make a film of this nature. I don't know but somehow I think even Indians are quite capable of such a film. Of course I mean Indian Hindus. Most Indian Muslims and Christains are fundamentalists like UAE and American Anglican Christians. US was fantastic in 60's. It's sad that same people have brought 'reborn Christian' Bush to power and are directly involved in the Holocaust in Iraq. I felt so sad while watching it. America has changed so drastically in the last 30 years. I really wish Americans realized that they are the only hope of human beings. If they march backwards then we are doomed.

But, he decided to be more of an \"auteur\" and direct the pictures himself. An early effort was this adaptation of a Broadway hit from 1955, which featured a courtroom battle between Paul Muni and Ed Begley. For the movie, he wanted Spencer Tracy and Frederic March. The latter is an unfortunate choice, with his unrelenting nervous tongue and chin movements and lip twitching. In a performance that vaguely resembles his earlier turn as Mr. Hyde, March seems all too aware that he's in a stage play, which Kramer cannot or will not \"open up.\" I saw the play in a preview (Muni, having eye surgery, was replaced by competent Luther Adler), with a stellar performance by Begley.

            "content": "What are our rights as humans? Do we have the ability to question the status quo? Or should we be conformed into the beliefs of the masses around us? These questions lie at the surface of Inherit the Wind a film brilliant in its ability to transcend time and be just as relevant today as it was back in 1960. The film is based on the actual 1925 Scopes Monkey Trial where a HS teacher was put on trial for violating the Butler Act, a law passed by the Tennessee state legislature banning the teaching of evolution.In the movie, Scopes renamed as Bertram Cates is arrested for teaching evolution in his HS science class, and be put on trial. As the trial begins to capture attention of the nation, Matthew Harrison Brady(Frederic March) a former three-time Presidential candidate comes to town to assist in the prosecution against Cates. Meanwhile, E. K Hornbeck a writer for the Baltimore Herald convinces Chicago lawyer Henry Drummond and one of Brady's long-time friends to come to Hillsboro to defend Cates setting the stage for a titanic confrontation of wills.The town led by Reverend Jeremiah Brown openly welcome Brady as a messiah who will fight for their views and denounce the evils of Cates and outside agitators like Drummond and the ideas of Darwinism. The trial which takes place in the \"dog days of the summer\" heightens the tension as we see Drummond and Brady go to war over their views and beliefs. For Brady, Drummond's defense of Cates is an \"attack one people's belief in God\", and an abandonment of faith. Drummond views it differently as Cates is being punished \" for being a thinking man\" and roundly condemns Brady and specifically the town for their vitriol towards what he feels are America's democratic values free speech and free thought. Rachel Brown who is dating Bert is torn between her father's religious views and her love, trying to find a way to balance the two but is ultimately condemned by her father \"for speaking out for a sinner.\"Tracy and March are brilliant in this film, particularly their scenes in court where they disagree on their beliefs but also the scenes outside there as well. However, what March does in this role which could have come off as over-acting and cartoonish is instead harrowing and tragic. Brady in spite of his religious zeal and passion, is also a man who understands the fear of the small-town to change. Note the scene he and Drummond share outside the boarding house where he begs Drummond not to take away from Hillsboro their belief in a higher power which gives them strength and joy in tough times. March also shows outside of the bombastic personality that Brady is not like the town and others, as he shows in perhaps the film's most haunting scene the prayer meeting.As the town and the reverend call for Cates to be struck down by God, and Reverend Brown condemns Rachel for asking forgiveness for Bert both Brady and his wife have had enough. Subtly, Brady condemns the Reverend for his rhetoric saying that the Bible teaches us \"God forgives his children\" and that \"he who troubles his own house shall inherit the wind.\" Brady stands up against the almost cult-like atmosphere, and shows his compassion and care.But as the trial goes on, things change. Brady and the court ensure Drummond can't his witnesses scientists, professors or even religious figures who can explain evolution and show Cates didn't try to hurt anyone. Drummond erupts at this, and in perhaps another incredible scene Tracy says that \"ignorance and fanaticism is forever busy and needs feeding.\" And that if you pass laws to ban teaching evolution, soon you'll ban the ability to write about it or think it, or even worse. Tracy creates a man who is sharp, funny, and is also not openly for evolution or religion, he simply wants a man to have the right to think for himself.He also is flawed with his outbursts, but also has a sharp wit like when he calls Brady to the stand as a witness, as the court will not allow any one to speak on evolution, only the bible.On the stand, Brady is confident in himself but begins to break as Drummond questions whether every word in the Bible should be taken literally or not. The first day which since there was no sun, could have been a day for an indeterminate length of time a month, a year, or even\n10 million years which a rock sample that Drummond has from the area was dated from.Drummond adds that that in order for society to develop, people must abandon faith which Brady erupts over saying faith is vital to people. Drummond spins around questioning why God would give us the power to think then, and starts to ground down Brady for his refusal to recognize the greatest thing humans have their own minds and ability to reason. As the testimony concludes, and as the crowd begins to turn and sneer him Brady begins to rant and rave about his belief in the Bible.As the movie concludes, I was reminded of one of my favorite Greek myths the story of\nIcarus who flew too close to the sun out of hubris. Brady grows more and more fanatic and stubborn as he believes he is fighting for God and his pride cant let him see how he's trying to force people to think like him or worship him. He breaks down with his wife Sarah saying people the ones he is trying to defend were laughing at him, his religion and his God.Finally at the end, even when Cates wins Brady is not satisfied because in his view the punishment of $100 is not enough, and will not deter anyone. He then asks to read a speech about God and religion as the trial ends and the only onlookers really watching him are Cates, Rachel, Hornbeck, Drummond who looks away as he see his friend is gone and Sarah watching her husband with tears in her eyes as she sees her husband fighting for his beliefs no matter whether they are popular or not. Brady who has flown to close to the sun, finally gets burned as his fervor and pride kill him as he falls with a thud to the floor of the courtroom.Gene Kelly as the cynical and bitter Hornbeck is just as brilliant as March and Tracy particularly his final scene with Tracy. Also Florence Etteridge who I didn't know until I re-watching the film after a decade, actually was March's real-life wife for almost 50 years adding even more heartbreak and pain to her work as she is really watching her husband lose himself.The film is a constant reminder as we deal with partisan politics amid fights over cancel culture, critical race theory, etc... that free thought and will are the vital things that hold us up. And that when people start trying to tell us how to teach, think, act or write we are heading backwards when truth is questioned, people are punished for being different and no one is willing to stand up for for themselves. Democracy depends on people's understanding of our freedoms and without them we will cease to exist.",

The film is loosely based on the \"Scopes Trial\" of 1925. It is important to emphasize the phrase \"loosely based\", because numerous details of the film, including character names and histories, do not coincide with the details of the Scopes Trial.Spencer Tracy excels at speechmaking as Henry Drummond, the lawyer defending the teacher. Fredric March has a more difficult role as the over-the-top fundamentalist folk hero against teaching evolution, Matthew Harrison Brady. March generally handles it well and delivers a number of memorable lines, but at times went too far for my liking in being crass and a buffoon. The rest of the cast is notable, particularly Gene Kelly as the derisive E. K. Hornbeck delivering sharp lines.The story is set in the fictitious small town of \"Heavenly\" Hillsboro in Tennessee. Marches of the villagers through the town, their meeting were effective ways to emphasize the town as being fundamentalist, although the suggestion that they would hang the teacher seems unrealistic. I thought the side story of the the firebrand preacher that shuns his own daughter was well-made and not out of place. The best scenes of the film were those in the court room, especially the dialogue between Drummond and Brady concerning the Bible. There is only one part of this that seemed strange, where Brady suggests that sex is the \"original sin\". It seems doubtful that a character like Brady's would consider sex a sin, only non-marital sex. The issues raised by the film remain pertinent today considering that many still challenge the validity of teaching evolution despite consensus among scientists.",

Shot in black and white (although it was 1960), the film mostly takes place in a courtroom, but the cinematography brings us deep, introspective camera angles to emphasis the emotional issues at the center of the story. The 1920s and the small-town South are clearly depicted as religious zealots, in an era of discovery and enlightenment. The resulting battles between evolutionists and creationists are predictable, but still engaging. Tracy is brilliant, as usual, and March delivers a strong performance as the evermore out-of-control \"Brady.\" Dick York, in his pre-Bewitched days, plays the biology teacher with passion and confusion, unaware of the larger issues at stake. He also looks a lot like Jim Carrey! However, the two best performances are turned in by Gene Kelly as an annoying Baltimore journalist and Claude Akins as the town preacher. Kelly is down-right likable as the prodding, ridiculing writer - and while you still expect him to bust out singing and dancing, he plays his role in control, mocking the creationist theory. Akins is so convincing as a religious zealot, and his voice (in my mind, his signature acting trait) booms as always - strong and willful. Good stuff, to be sure.",

Of course, some of the facts and views of the Scopes Monkey Trial are exaggerated (the attourneys would never be able to make their speeches or ask many of their questions in a real court), but this is true of every movie. The relationship between Drummond and the Bradys is perfectly portrayed, and Tracy, March, and Kelly deliver performances that rival any other movie they have ever appeared in. Every aspect of the film, from the arrival of Brady in Hillsborough, to the selection of jurors, through the death of \"son of god\" Brady, is excellently created by director Stanley Kramer. I suggest that everyone looking for one of the greatest law movies ever made see \"Inherit the Wind.\"",

            "content": "I read one review that called this film a \"fictionized\" account of the Scopes \"Monkey Trial.\" That is not entirely accurate. It is more of an editorialized account of the trial. The names of the principal players have been altered, William Jennings Bryan becomes Matthew Harrison Brady, yet the story is the same. This is an opinion piece. This film is designed to argue a specific viewpoint, and it does it rather successfully. I do not agree with the conclusions of the film. I do not agree with the beliefs of the filmmakers, yet I think the film is very effective. One of the primary rhetorical devices of the film is to marginalize the \"Religionists\". Each of them, whether it is the townsfolk, Brady, or Reverened Jeremiah Brown, are made to be buffoons--ignorant and hateful. One review said the character of Brady was overblown. I think that is the point. He is supposed to be a pompous, arrogant, loud-mouthed moron. I like the fact that you almost always see him stuffing his face with food. This strengthens the image of him as a gluttonous simpleton. This type of rhetorical device is very effective. The sanest, most logical, most humane people in the film are the ones in support of Cates and in opposition of the Creation-only viewpoint. The Reverend is willing to sacrifice his own daughter for his supposed fanatical beliefs. This is one of the most powerful aspects of the film. It portrays Christians as heartless, blind followers. I don't think this is always true, but the film makes it seems as though it is. Even without the rhetorical aspects of the film it is very good. The courtroom scenes are a paradigm for conveying claustrophobia and paranoia. The people are trapped in this hot, confined space. It becomes a tremendous metaphor for the town's belief system. The acting is superb. Each actor hits each scene with just the right note. I think one of the greatest dialog scenes in all of cinema is the final courtroom battle, which is taken almost verbatim from the actual trial. The two actors are at the top of the game as engage in a titanic verbal spar. The cinematography effectively portrays the collapse of Brady's arguments, and eventually his whole life. The dialog in this scene, and throughout the entire movie, is some of the best there has ever been. This is an excellent film. Even for one who doesn't agree with the philosophy of the film, I can appreciate the artistry of this great film.",

I won't comment on the acting- It's personal opinion whether it's over the top, or realistic, or whatever- the court scenes are my main issue with the film. Throughout the movie, I found myself wondering how the two lawyers managed to get so high up in the business; they neglected to research their cases at all, and seemed to believe that the only measure of a good lawyer was how loud they could yell. In fact, they seemed to feel that they didn't even have to make a decent point as long as they were yelling. At one point, the lawyer played by Tracy tries to make a point, and sees that the jury does not understand... and then does not explain it. The lawyers also took to arguing between themselves in the middle of the courtroom- and the judge let them. Furthermore I felt that I could have done a better job defending the teacher, and I am not even close to being a lawyer. I'm sure this is a very well made movie, and the actors are certainly excellent... but to call it thought provoking and almost perfect is going too far.",

This film is not based on The Scopes Monkey Trial of 1925, but the 'Jerome Lawrence' (qv) and 'Robert E. Lee' (qv) play of 1950.  Although play and film use chunks of transcript \u0096 the Drummond/Brady cross-examination is almost verbatim Darrow's questioning of Bryan \u0096 the play shows its separate evolution. Written at the heart of the Anti-Communist Witch-Hunts the reason Drummond makes an impassioned plea for the right to think becomes obvious. To highlight their anti-witchhunt message Lawrence and Lee took a lot of licence in making the townspeople very bigoted, and in dramatising the circumstances of `Bertram Gates' arrest. As a result, some Christians condemn the film as an attack on their religion.  Rather it highlights the state of society a quarter of a century after the events nominally depicted. The play, although written in 1950 could not be performed until 1955; since when it has been filmed and staged several times, most recently in Broadway in 1995 with 'Tony Randall' (qv) and a 1999 TV movie starring 'Jack Lemmon' (qv) and 'George C Scott' (qv)",

His character is significantly expanded from the play. One example is the scene where Hornbeck tells Drummond that after he (Hornbeck) dies he won't be un-mourned. Dtrummond will be at the funeral, he says, because that's the kind of guy he is. This illustrates perfectly the differences between the journalist who writes of injustice, but mainly it seems for his own enjoyment, and the crusading lawyer who takes up unpopular causes because it is the right thing to do.I have loved this play since I read it in high school, and the movie with it's great stars, does not disappoint.",

He is a stage actor and old-school Rod Steiger. Spencer Tracy is from Milwaukee where people don't give a damn what others think about them or their city. His performance was superb as it was in all of his films.Dick York was mis-cast as Cates (Scopes). He is a comedian who co-starred with Barbara Eden in 'Bewitched.' Harry Morgan was mis-cast as the judge (far too young for a God-fearing southern judge) and the sidekick to Jack Webb in 'Dragnet.' In 1960, movies began to be more realistic, yet the name of the the town and the characters' names were changed to protect the 'innocent.' Anyone with a brain knows the lawyers were William Jennings Bryant (prosecution) and Clarence Darrow (defense) and the teacher was named Scopes, not Cates. These scenarios make the film almost laughable. In fact, I look upon this film as a comedy 'teaser' except for the performance of Spencer Tracy. Gene Kelly, a great dancer and so-so actor, was entirely mis-cast as the Baltimore reporter.Lastly, a belief or dis-belief in evolution is a matter of faith. A belief or dis-belief in God is a matter of faith. There is no right or wrong, but if there was no religion the world would be a much better place.",

            "content": "The film itself is loosely based upon the Scopes trial of 1925 and is in essence an examination of two opposing forces -mankind's willingness to think for itself as against its willingness to follow simple doctrines which can thereby give rise inflexible intolerance.A key statement in the film is that 'fanaticism and ignorance are forever busy and need feeding'. Religion in this instance is used as an example of an avenue toward intolerance whereby mankind takes the fresh and illuminating thoughts of the bible and translates them (or more accurately allows others to translate them) into a rigid set of rules which are thereby man-made whilst assuming the aura of god-given.Directed by Stanley Kramer and starring two hollywood heavyweights, Spencer Tracy and Fredric March, the film benefits from tight dialogue, a claustrophobic courthouse set and a rumbustuous performance by the leads who spend a great deal of time trying to outdo each other. With a strong supporting cast (only Gene Kelly looked uncomfortable and he passed the comment that 'he had finally stepped out of his class\") the film is a quality product of the kind rarely seen these days.Whilst the set was officially closed, it was packed to the rafters with hollywood luminaries such as Frank Sinatra who spent days watching the two stars slug it out and give a master class in screen performing. The film's climax is a set piece confrontation where the issues are examined with intelligence and wit and it is worth recording the scenes between March on the witness stand, and Tracy examining him, as an example of two actors at the height of their profession.Given the odor of political correctness where free speech is stifled, given the intolerance of religious leaders who have translated Islamic and Christian teachings to suit their own narrow prejudices, and given the intolerance of leaders towards those who try to think for themselves, this film is as fresh and relevant today as it was in 1960.

Stunning camera work, punchy dialogs, some award worthy secondary roles acting, Akins is a must see, and all the know how that made Tracy, March and Kelly household names.Yes, we could have a jolly good time of a movie. And we should, from the opening credits, with the astute use of the song \"gimme that old time religion\" to highlight the old west walk of the town officials from court to school. Followed by the 2 hours long compelling mix of film noir esthetics, the use of shadows and.slightly unbalanced camera angles, and dialogs worthy of the best social commentary blended with great comedy movies, with the right mix of one liners and speeches.The movie offers passion, be it for the belief in science or the belief in religion, but also for a more cynical belief in the power of words. In the end the three main characters are first and foremost men of words, and the actors do leave room to consider if the characters are not more interesting in listening to their own voice than to whatever principle they stand for. It also offers satire both of small town mentality and big city arrogance, one gets a feel that the seriousness shown by the townsfolk vs the levity of the city fellas is actually used to highlight the overall issue of simple belief vs principled cause. And if we do take a step backward from the actuality of the debate, this is what makes this a great movie.And this is also what makes it a problem. There is an exchange between the lawyer for evolution (Tracy) and the wife of the prosecutor for creationism (Eldridge):\n-He still has a very loud voice (says Tracy of his opponent)\n-He still has something to say (answers the wife)\nAnd still, these three people are and remain old time friends. And that encapsulates the issue. In these times when school, science, religion, freedom of expression and excess of principles are again colliding in the worst ways, it seems we can't pick friends over sides anymore.Let's be provocative and summarize the movie, ignoring the issue, an outlaw teacher advances his beliefs, in contradiction to the laws of his place. He's attacked by opinionated no nuance officials led by a public figure who wants to make good of the occasion, he is defended by loud mouthed lawyer and journalist who want to make a point. Nots so clear cut then. But this is because that is not the point of the movie, neither is the choice between evolution and creationism, this movie is about the confrontation of ideas, the confrontation of how to communicate, the confrontation of voices.The importance of this movie is not who's right or wrong, it is that debate, public and private, prevails, and, wherever, whatever, we come from, that is what should make us humans!",

            "content": "In the final decade of his career, Spencer Tracy would work exclusively with producer and director Stanley Kramer, roles that would turn out to be among his most memorable. However, it's also worth mentioning that in addition to Tracy's talent, he's supporting by a cast of very talented individuals, who are all perfect in their own aspects. And furthermore, the film itself is something that in many ways, is still as relevant now as it was back when it was released.Inherit The Wind is a powerful film that features the zenith of talent at its best, and features a subject that has becoming increasingly more prominent in today's society. The film is an engaging and thrilling involvement that is essentially a clash of philosophies, more specifically, it's the right to think against those who swear by creationism, a battle between the ones who dare to think for themselves versus the ones who refuse to have their beliefs challenged. This, combined with fabulous acting, is used to create a compelling film that some might say has a place among the best in American cinema.The film is a dramatization of the real-life story of John T. Scopes, a Tennessee schoolteacher who was arrested for teaching Darwin's theory of evolution in school. The trial the followed became both a media sensation, as well as match of minds between two famous men, Clarence Darrow, who represented the defense, and William Jennings Bryan, who represented the prosecution. Even though the film does make several deviations from real life for the purpose of drama, there's still no denying that the film is a powerful experience that in many ways, is still relevant, primarily in regards to the creationists who dislike having their beliefs challenged. In addition to that, it's also a powerhouse for talent, featuring some incredibly gifted individuals giving the performances of their careers.What makes the film hold up is how it manages to say relevant. The film basically represents a time where politics was dominated by religion, and while the idea sounds preposterous, it's very true to how it was in real life, and it's actually very disturbing. There are several scenes in the film where the townsfolk are shown demonstrating their beliefs against Dick York's character (the one based on Scopes), with many even calling for him to be hanged, with Tracy's character also being targeted as well. There's also a rather chilling supporting role from Claude Akins, who plays the town preacher, who gives several unnerving and intimidating speeches about how those who believe in evolution are doomed to hell, even going as far as to say that about his own daughter. There's also a scene in court in which Tracy is held in contempt after being pushed to his limits and launching into a speech about ignorance and fanaticism, which is something else that is ever so relevant in the present. However, it should be mentioned that the film isn't against religion itself, but instead against the aforementioned ideas of fanaticism and ignorance, which is a mindset that is incredibly toxic.As compelling as this dramatization of the Monkey Trial is to see, it's also very engaging to see what is essentially a duel between two of the greatest actors in the history of cinema, Spencer Tracy and Frederic March. The two of them were perfect, with it being hard to decide which one was better, since it seemed as if they were both trying to upstage each other. In a rare dramatic role, Gene Kelly was stupendous as a reporter who arrives in town to cover the trial, who throws shade as the creationists. Kelly's performance seems to be rather ironic, in which he takes stabs at the people who loved his musical performances but have dogmatic opinions against those who think differently from themselves. However, Kelly is in a way, like them because of his support for Dick York's character. The aforementioned Claude Akins plays what is probably his best role as a firebrand preacher who creates a divide with his own daughter because of her love for Dick York's character, the one who is on trial for daring to go against the belief of creationists, and what's unfortunate, is that there are many people like him in the present day. Special mention goes to Harry Morgan, who plays the judge presiding over the trial, as well as Noah Berry Jr., who plays a farmer who helps out Tracy becomes of something personal. In fact, I don't think that Stanley Kramer could've picked a better cast if he tried, because everyone in the film was as perfect as one could imagine.Ultimately, Inherit The Wind is an excellent film that has incredible staying power in regards to its messages. As I mentioned before, it's not an indictment of religion, but of religious fanaticism, and those who criticize the right to think. In addition, it's also worth seeing to see a very talented cast perform in what you might say are the roles of their careers, as there wasn't a single performance that faltered. The film is definitely one that should be seen, because of how great it is, but it's also one that might disturb its audience, both because of some of the subject matter, and because of how it's managed to stay relevant.",

I'd still think it was nonsense even if I was agnostic or atheist or a buddhist, no offense to anyone.) I'm saying this to point out that I don't really support either \"side\" of the argument in this film.This wonderful courtroom drama is set in the Bible belt, where a high school teacher tries to teach about Darwin's Origin Of The Species in school (therefore breaking the law) and is imprisoned. An opportunist, has-been conservative politician sees this a chance to get in the public's favor once again, and announces that he'll be the prosecutor's attorney (or however that works in the US system). The accused teacher, in despair, writes to a newspaper and they also send a famous liberal lawyer, for his defense.The movie obviously takes sides here, presenting the bigotry in the small town in a harsh light, and taking the liberal side. But the politics of the movie is only a minor point, the real star is the great direction, photography, script and acting. Spencer Tracy is amazing as the defense lawyer bashing every point made by the prosecution, although the whole town, even the judge, acts like them. The dialogue is great, and no matter whose ideas you support, or even if you have no interest in the subject at all, it still keeps you interested. I just kept sighing, saying wow, they really used to make movies back then.It's Spencer Tracy's movie, but the supporting cast is no less stellar. Gene Kelly, in particular.

March is grand as the bible-thumping southern attorney prosecuting York, while Tracy is great, as always, as the big city lawyer who defends the unfortunate biology teacher.
