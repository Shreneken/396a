            "content": "Part satire, part slapstick comedy, part melodrama; the great pioneer of film, Charles Chaplin, has created his own monument with this film. At the same time, 'Modern Times' was Chaplin's last goodbye to the era of silent film - which, remarkably, had already ended almost a decade earlier.After nearly 80 years, this screen marvel still makes me laugh, cry - and think about the ongoing automatization of practically every trivial little thing in our lives. Modern times, indeed. To me, this film is as entertaining and funny today as I imagine it was then, and it's certainly as relevant as it was then. The tramp still rules.

            "content": "One of this movie's most famous images--Chaplin sliding around inside the gears and cogs of a monstrous machine--provides a handy visual to go along with my opinion of the film in general: there are individual cogs that I remember as being brilliant, but when put together they don't make a totally satisfying machine.Unlike \"City Lights\" or \"The Gold Rush\" before, or \"The Great Dictator\" after, I didn't get caught up in the narrative of \"Modern Times,\" and I felt there were longer gaps between the funny bits. However, some of the set pieces in this are hilarious, most notably the scene where Chaplin finds himself strapped into an automatic feeding machine that goes berserk; and a nimble scene on roller skates that showcases his athleticism.Sadly, \"Modern Times\" was an all too applicable metaphor for Chaplin's place in the film industry. New technologies were beginning to make his artistry obsolete, and the sadness of that is palpable in the film's final shot.I'm recommending \"Modern Times\" because it's a very good movie. I just didn't think it was as good as some of Chaplin's other well-known projects.Grade: B+",

            "content": "Greetings from Lithuania.\"Modern Times\" (1936) is my first movie which i saw that features Charles Chaplin. Saw it first time in 2015, but nevertheless it's a great movie. Comedy here is truly funny, and it's not just a comedy. It tells a story, with some underlying themes that are still kinda topical till this day \u2013 technology is changing, evolving, and if you are not keeping pace with it, you will have some hard times like our hero of this movie.Acting here is very solid, actually i was surprised of how well acted this movie was \u2013 no one overreacted. Story itself is interesting and movie is very well paced \u2013 at running time 1 h 27 min it almost never drags and is entertaining from start till finish.Overall, \"Modern Times\" is a black and white silent movie (there are some sounds actually) which safely can be viewed for the first time even in 2015 \u2013 79 years after it's original release. It has some truly genuine comedic situations, it tells good story and pacing of picture is very solid. Maybe it is not possible to review this movie correctly now because it's very old, but great movies are great movies \u2013 they can be viewed no matter what.",

Excellent criticism of the Taylorism/capitalistic through humor relevant for any age, nationality or time; story-telling that would touch anyone alike in a universal fashion, every now and then sparkled with Chaplin's unique and deeply influential sense of humor and on-screen comedy. Hilarious in moments, and unique. A man of many talents clearly, and excellent at those. Overall this depicts quite a zany approach to life, one that is pure in essence and profoundly antagonistic with the current ways of the time, and ways of today still: a life dominated by one-track thinking, rigid and stubborn social etiquette, and the enslavement this new world has brought in so many aspects to the human species. Finally, it highlights the importance of never giving up; EVER; and the preciousness of love.",

            "content": "It is difficult to review Chaplin's movies objectively because many of us have seen them, or at least have heard about them, since we were young. They have become part of our emotional and/or cultural background.Chaplin is arguably the only complete director: in most of his pictures, he also produces, acts, writes the script, composes the music, does his own stunts and edits. His talent and reputation generated numerous commercial successes, even when he continued directing silent movies after their time. \"Talkies\" were the only films produced after 1927, the few silent attempts afterwards were failures; yet Chaplin was an exception: \"City Lights\" in 1931 and \"Modern Times\" in 1936 were sensations worldwide (the latter includes a few sounds but they are marginal). This is remarkable since nine years is an eternity in cinema timeframe. Only in 1940 did Chaplin direct a talkie.COMEDY OR DRAMA?Is the movie a comedy? Partly: tragi-comedy is Chaplin's trademark. In my opinion, there are three levels of humour.1. Pure amusement, sometimes as in slapstick: the tramp eats all he can to be sent to jail and even buys more when he is with the policeman; he is drugged in jail; the tramp and the gamin imagine their life in an idyllic house; the tramp roller-skates close to an edge in the department store (fabulous stunt); he makes a lousy waiter but a great actor at the end. Again, I am not certain how much of the fun is derived from childhood memories and/or the fact we feel younger as we watch the film. To enjoy it fully, we must lay aside some of our adult critical sense, notably towards old-fashioned cinema.2. No humour, just drama: the gamin's father dies; her sisters are taken away; the tramp crashes his way through the crowd to get a job (an efficient illustration of ruthless competition).3. Amusement with a dramatic twist: these are the most frequent scenes, and probably the best. We grin even as we laugh. The movie opens on sheep moving grouped (of which a black one: an allusion to the tramp?), that fade out to workers coming out of the subway. This must have been a shock for the audience during the Great Depression. Another example is one of Chaplin's most famous scenes ever: the tramp tries the eating machine. It is at the same time hilarious (Chaplin really gives all of himself here) and pathetic: a metaphor on ill-conceived progress, oppression of man by machine and conditions of workers obliged to comply with strange requests.Other scenes include: the entire first part in the factory, including when the tramp is stuck in the machine (inside shot, that became iconic), which also happens to a colleague later on (outside shot); the tramp launches by mistake an unfinished ship into the sea, with footage of an actual ship that was probably sunk because of the Depression; the tramp and the gamin make most of their shabby hut.The movie efficiently alternates these three levels of humour, as well as its rhythm. It famously starts as a whirlwind with dynamic tempo and music. And it ends like a roller-coaster: funny musical (the tramp sings), emotional (he is hired), dramatic (the police arrest the gamin), thriller (they run away as climatic music plays), melancholic (they are on the road, free but uncertain). The last image is rightfully double-edged: the tramp and the gamin walk away quietly, yet mountains ahead block their road. She looks like an elegant lady, he looks a bit like a clown with his funny walk and big shoes. We don't know where they are going, nor do they.MODERNITYHence Chaplin's ambition was far more than to just divert. Themes depicted eighty years ago are still modern:\nCrisis, redundancies, strikes, inequalities, social unrest.Working conditions in factories, even though exaggerated by humour and symbols: productivity, control, burn-out.Technology that dehumanises: chain-working, the eating machine, video surveillance (a science-fiction element at the time). Remarkably, the only sounds of the film are coming from devices, not humans: screen, phonograph, radio.Success with talent, work and some luck.The law. The topic is prominent (the police are omnipresent) and ambiguous. Can one steal food to survive? Chaplin seems to excuse this behaviour. The tramp is on both sides of the law: he steals food but helps the police arrest villains in jail. And the police's role is complex; notably, they shoot an unarmed man, followed by the ironic card: \"The law takes charge of the orphans\".Violence and drugs in prison.The universal dimension of the movie shows by the fact the main characters have no name: the tramp, the gamin. Chaplin will be blamed for its social topics during the McCarthy era, among other grievances, and he will be forced to exile. Considering it now, this seems ridiculous since the message of the film is not communist: the tramp and the gamin want everything but change society; they search for a job, a home and respect. Note also Lincoln's portrait in the tramp's cell: he is a patriot.The movie does not take sides:\nWorkers can be friendly or violent.Policemen can be friendly (e.g. in jail) or violent (one purposelessly pushes the tramp outside the factory).Prison inmates can be honest (the tramp) or villains.Women can be attractive (the gamin) or not (all others, actually).This double-sidedness also divides individuals:\nBig Bill was bullying the tramp in the factory, but later sympathises with him.The gamin steals and then becomes settled.The tramp will do anything to protect the ones he loves (the gamin, children), but can abuse almost anybody else to achieve it: a recurrent feature in Chaplin's pictures.The underlying message seems to be: people are not good or bad, it mainly depends on their conditions. Yet another modern theme.",

            "content": "It is a testament to Chaplin's filmmaking skills that he is able to impose such significant meaning on what really boils down to little more than a series of comedy skits strung together on an apparently flimsy clothesline of a plot. Indeed, the cinematic value of Modern Times is unquestionable, but it is ironically noteworthy that such a simple and even blocky plot is made into such a memorable film experience and delivers such a strong, time-transcending message about poverty stricken populations.\nIt is no secret that Charlie Chaplin was more or less dragged into the sound era against his will. In the early part of the 20th century, he had built a tremendous career as a silent film actor, and had created a character, the Tramp, that was purely a silent film character who could not be transported into the sound era. Charlie had built his career and his popularity with the Tramp, and the coming of sound to the cinema meant the end of that character (as illustrated by Robert Downey Jr.'s Charlie Chaplin in the 1992 film Chaplin, `The Tram CAN'T talk. The minute he talks, he's dead.'). Chaplin delivers to the world a cynical satire about modern technology as well as his own ode to the silent film with Modern Times.Charlie plays the part of a man who works a dehumanizing position in a factory in which he is little more than a component of a machine, and he is controlled like a pawn by the menacing boss, who we see mostly as a looming face on a tremendous television screen. Clearly, the most memorable scenes in the film involve something to do with the factory, such as Charlie's brief trip into the innards of the machine, as well as his warm-hearted efforts to feed lunch to a man who has inadvertently become lodged in a machine, with only his head free. However, there is a very noteworthy but fairly subtle subplot that quietly reveals Chaplin's fondness for the silent film.The first and most obvious thing is that for the most part, this is a silent film. There are intertitles, there is precious little dialogue, and the film's main character doesn't utter a sound until near the end of the film. But there are also a lot of other things that more subtly hint that silent films are better than sound films. For one thing, the only intelligible words spoken in the film are done so through some sort of barrier. There is the factory boss speaking demandingly through the television screen, and the feeding machine company speaking through the radio as they try to sell the feeding machine to the factory boss. This becomes the most obvious by the fact that anyone speaking on screen - such as the factory boss as he tells the men that the feeding machine is not practical - only does so in intertitles. We know that dialogue can be put in the film, but Chaplin chooses only to do this in a detached and mechanized way.There is also a very strong example of Chaplin's endless sympathy for poor people at several points in this film. The most significant example of this is his interactions with the Gamin, played by Paulette Goddard, as well as his nearly constant contempt toward the police. After the scene where he gorges himself at a small diner (note that the window said `Cafeteria: Tables For Ladies'), he casually calls an officer into the diner and tells him to pay the tab, unable to pay it himself. As he is handcuffed to the officer, he gets a cigar from a nearby vendor and hands some large candy bars to a couple of small children nearby, who look to be the type of children who are never sure where their next meal is going to come from.\nCharlie plays a hard working, lower class man in Modern Times, and no matter how badly he just wants to get some good work and earn a living so that he can buy a house for himself and Paulette, things constantly seem to go wrong for him. It seems that this bad luck is used to suggest that poor people are not poor as a result of their own shortcomings, but because they just can't seem to work their way up to a better life, no matter how hard they try. This social commentary is intertwined with such skillful intricacy with the story about Chaplin's love of silent film that there is really no switching back and forth between the two. Modern Times strikes me as especially memorable because it is a very simple story that is punctuated by a series of comedy skits, yet it also delivers several different messages that are important to society as well as to the filmmaker himself. In this way, the movie almost seems to deliver these strong messages without the audience even being aware that they are being presented with these issues. It is a great way to mix entertainment with important societal topics, and Charlie's decision to finally have the Tramp utter vocalized speech is done so in an endlessly watch-able song and dance scene, adding to the immeasurable number of film skits for which Charlie Chaplin will be remembered and loved.",

            "review_title": "Still a Modern Classic",
            "content": "We like to think that comedy has evolved since the time of silent film. We like to think that with the advent of sound and the injection of modern technology in all aspects of film production has made just about everything better. Indeed, it's hard to argue that so much of today's fun and farce just can't exist without a sound mixer and a few boom mics laying around. Ask yourself, if you put The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005) or The Hangover (2009) on mute, would you really get anything out of it?By 1936, sound had long taken the film industry by storm. In fact, if you listen closely to the moment Al Jolson uttered \"You ain't heard nothing' yet,\" in The Jazz Singer (1927), you may have heard the careers of many shattering in earnest. Never has there been a piece of technology so seamlessly adapted to an industry before or since. To name the number of noteworthy films made after 1929 that were silent would be to name perhaps a dozen.Yet with this adoption came growing pains. The cumbersome size of the Photokinema sound-on-disc machines and their components meant cameras had to stay bolted down. Actors had to not wonder too far from the mic or worse still, find a way to wear several pounds of bulky microphones under their garments. What once were dreams, stitched together by editing cuts became pale imitations of stage plays. The grammar of film essentially took two steps back.Seeing this, silent era superstar Charlie Chaplin decided to stem the tide. In 1931, he directed, produced and starred in City Lights, a romantic masterpiece of stagecraft and pantomime that to this day is one of the best examples of the beauty we lost. Seeing the writing on the wall by 1936, Chaplin decided to give the Tramp one last hurrah before retiring the character. One last bow before the tendrils of technology transforms his career into a shadow of its former self.Modern Times is at once one last bow, one last look at innocence lost and one glorious masterpiece of cinema. In it, Charlie's lovable Tramp struggles to adapt to a modern technological age while causing light-hearted mayhem everywhere he goes. Throughout the film he tries to conform to working as a security guard, a longshoreman, a factory worker, a mechanic etc. yet his peculiarity prevents him from being at a work site for too long. During his struggles he befriends an woman named Ellen (Goddard) who aids him in his quest for fulfilling work. They of course, fall in love in the chaste innocent way that couples did in the films of the time.Modern Times is infamous, for among other things, a soundtrack that includes the earworm \"Smile\" composed by Chaplin himself. The most famous cover was crooned by Nat King Cole whose astringent voice had the poorly covered scars of a life harshly lived. \"Smile\" to Modern Times is perfect; both as a bittersweet anthem and as addition to the American songbook. It perfectly captures the Tramp's uneasy monachopsis while hanging onto a buoyant hope of finding purpose. It's at times sad, at times triumphant but always life-affirming.Modern Times is also known for large, unique and detail filled comic set-pieces that despite being around for eighty years still coaxes laughter. One after another, these moments capture the absurdities of industrial life no other film does. Whether it be Chaplin toiling over a conveyor belt of widgets or literally being engulfed by a mechanical do-dad, He always has the perfect expression to reaffirm his humanity in the most inhuman of situations. It's pitch-perfect pantomime done by a true master of the craft.Of course, being the film advertised as \"the one where The Tramp speaks,\" Modern Times does succumb to the encroachment of sound. And unlike in City Lights, Chaplin decides to inject it as part of a large theme as opposed to a target of mockery. The film is book- ended by two moments of sound, the first of which is his factory boss yelling at him through a large projected screen. \"Get back to work!\" he yells while the Tramp struggles to find a moment of respite. The inclusion of sound as an oppressor, even a personified one is an effective means of identification. Those who have heard the phrase \"If you have time to lean, you have time to clean,\" will no doubt sympathize with Chaplin's character in that particular moment in time.The second time sound is used, is to affirm Chaplin's Tramp as a unique individual amid a crowd of onlookers. Late in the film, Ellen finds a job for the Tramp at a restaurant as a singing waiter. Right before his debut, he struggles to remember the words of the song he's to sing. He decides to put the lyrics on his detachable cuffs. Invariably, he looses the cuffs and, thinking quickly, begins to sing in gibberish. It's a prank pulled on audiences clamoring for the Tramp to finally speak on screen, yet it's one that's so incongruously Chaplin that one can't help but admire it.With Chaplin having a hand in every aspect of the film's production, one can write an entire book fawning over the exploits of a genius so ahead of his time, we still feel his influence. Modern Times showcases that genius, filling the celluloid with beauty, pathos, humor and humanity. Years after most of today's contemporary comedies fade into obscurity, those centuries from now will still fondly remember Charlie and his lovable Tramp. I guarantee it.",

            "review_title": "The Farewell Performance of The Tramp",
            "content": "Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (1936) is the final film to feature the great actor/director/writer's most easily recognizable incarnation: The Tramp. Here is a character that is so ingrained in the collective conscious of modern film audiences that many recognize him despite the fact that they have not seen a single Chaplin film. Indeed, several iconographic studies have labeled The Tramp (with his worn hat, distinctive mustache, dusty suit, cane, and trademark waddle) as the single most identifiable fictional image in history.Still, the film that perhaps most influenced the creation and thematic realization of Modern Times was not even a silent one. The Jazz Singer, which debuted in 1927, five years before Modern Times began production, is perhaps the most important watershed film in the industry's century-old history. In the film, comic great Al Jolson stands up in front of the audience and...sings. And as Millard Mitchell said in Singin' in the Rain, the public was suddenly in a frenzy for \"Talking pictures! Talking pictures!\" Sadly, with the advent of synchronized sound and dialogue, the world of silent filmmaking began to slip into obscurity with audiences and studios now viewing it as obsolete and undesirable. Nevertheless, Chaplin continued his passion for the subtle craft by creating City Lights (1931), which many critics and academics consider one of the greatest films ever made, but by the time Modern Times was released, Chaplin was one of the last directors left clinging to a dying art.Modern Times is not an entirely silent film, (there are dialogue snippets and sound effects), but if you look closely, every character with dialogue (excluding Chaplin himself) is being mocked. Even when The Tramp opens his mouth (the only time he ever did so in a film), the words are nonsensical, defying the burgeoning convention that dialogue is mandatory for substance, entertainment, and quality.Despite the film's status as one of the greatest comedies of all-time, it is hard to ignore the political component. In his movies, Chaplin often exhibited a great mistrust for authority and progress, as often embodied through the social elite, the police, and wealthy entrepreneurs. The irony of the film's title, then, is two-fold. It connects with Chaplin's own bitter feelings regarding his moribund art form, but also refers to the plight of the working classes during the Great Depression (long working hours with little job security and meager salary, while the upper classes remain wealthy and bide their idle time) The world was changing fast, and Chaplin foresaw that many of these changes were far from beneficial.As we watch The Tramp struggle through the modern, mechanized world, we laugh at his antics and the absurdity of their results, but we can also feel pain and pity. He is clearly a man who does not belong. Indeed, The Tramp can almost be thought of as a misfit who has passed through a membrane from some alternate reality and unwittingly fallen into our familiar world (notice that he does not have a name or identification of any kind, and as far as we know, he has no friends, family, funds, or history).He takes on assembly lines, feeding machines, department stores, policemen and various other mass-oriented aspects of the industrialized world (all which demand and exhibit sameness and conformity), but The Tramp (and his symbolic extension, the individual) never seem to fit.This is, consequently, why Modern Times is also one of the most poignant love stories ever put on film. The only character who is on the same level as The Tramp is a young, homeless woman who is referred to as \"The Gamin\" and is played by Chaplin's then-wife, Paulette Goddard. These two are brought together by the fact they have almost nothing except the will to live and continue forward, despite adversity. Both are nameless, neither has a home, and they each have no money or material possessions.It is here that Chaplin makes his most poignant and saddening statement about modern living. The Tramp and The Gamin are the only characters who exhibit individuality and idealism, yet they are also the ones lowest on the social and economic food chain. The conclusion of the film, which most likely reflects upon Chaplin's own emotions, is tinged with sadness, but also a lingering hopefulness that resonates as loudly and clearly today as it did more than sixty years ago.Then there is, of course, the comedy, which is the stuff of legendary status. Some of the most memorable comic images in film history are found in Modern Times. These include The Tramp's bout with an assembly line (and his resulting twitches), his unfortunate encounter with \"nose-powder\", the moment when he quite literally becomes a cog in the wheels of industry, and his epic struggle to bring roast duck to an angry customer.In my opinion, however, the two standout moments are the scene in a department store involving a blindfold and some rollerskates (the most exquisite moment of comedy in the film) and the sequence where The Tramp is submitted to the mad whim of an out-of-control feeding machine (the most uproarious moment in the film).These are just a handful of moments that make Modern Times the enduring masterpiece that it is. On a personal level, the aspect of the film that resonates strongest with me is its appeal to the idealistic misfit in all of us. In our hearts, many of us long for the simplicity and exuberance with which The Tramp and The Gamin live life (with attention to the bare essentials and an absence of need for materialism and modern trappings).As Chaplin so skillfully shows, however, our modern times make this lifestyle a faded dream, lost among the sheep-like herds of men and women scurrying through a modern metropolis that only Fritz Lang could make seem darker and more devoid of true humanity. Still, the final image of Modern Times refuses to let the film end on an exclusively tragic note and demonstrates that the individual is still alive and may yet find his way in an ever-changing world.",

            "content": "Charles Chaplin seemingly had been pushed out of the movie business by the early-1930s due to the advent of sound (a medium that just never seemed right with him). Chaplin, probably the best film-maker/performer of the 20th Century, did not despair though. He fought back with heart and emotion and by 1936 \"Modern Times\" was a major box office and critical success. It is a movie that quietly showed a man suffering through a world of change. As a factory worker in the film, Chaplin tries to cope with the industrial revolution and tries to make it through a quickly changing U.S. economy. He finds love with vagrant Paulette Goddard (who ended up marrying Chaplin in real life) and the two come together and lean on one another in a world of uncertainty and change. \"Modern Times\" is one of those films that will put a smile on your face, but it could make you weep just as easily. Chaplin's world was changing (and not necessarily for the better from his point of view) and he wanted to express the variations in his old way of doing things and the new way everyone else had accepted. Goddard is also probably the best actress to match Chaplin's charm in one of his pictures. Their love for one another (even though the marriage lasted a relatively short amount of time in real life) just seems to shine on the silver screen and they have a chemistry that is sweet and heart-warming. Beautifully made, wonderfully written, perfectly performed, smart, insightful and always brilliant, \"Modern Times\" is another film from Chaplin that will brand itself on the souls of all true lovers of the cinema. 5 stars out of 5.",

It charmed me instantly, of course, because Chaplin was a true genius and magician - his creation, \"Little Tramp\" is easily understood to anybody no matter what background and we love him dearly, for all his sweetness, clumsiness and old heart. This story apparently happens in Metropolis-like factory where work, machines and buttons are parodied mercilessly until we (audience) roar with laughter - I was honestly surprised that something filmed almost a century ago was still so fresh and funny. Basically, everything after the first start on the fast track was new to me and I laughed and laughed, until I found myself rewinding scenes and enjoying them again. What a genius!Once Little Tramp looses his job - there is a whole unspoken atmosphere of unfairness, poverty and depression around - he quickly ends up in a prison, from which he doesn't even want to leave. However, he gets Cocaine in his salt, (Charlie Chaplin on a Coke!), saves policemen from escaped criminals, meets minister's wife (very funny scene) and gets release from the prison, with job recommendation letter. And this is still just a beginning of the movie! There is much, much more coming up later - it really goes on forever but its wonderful, heart-warming and joyous to watch. I almost forgot everything about myself and my whereabouts while I was so deeply lost in this masterpiece. Film is so immensely rich with characters, stories, little details and magic that I honestly think its one of the best things I have ever seen.",

            "content": "\"Modern Times\" is in my top 5 films, and #2 in my list of favorite comedies. Charles Chaplin is arguably the most talented human being, nevermind film maker, that ever lived. I first saw this treasure about 8 years ago, and I watched it again recently to make sure that it really WAS funny, and that I had not given it too much praise because it was simply a Chaplin film. \"Modern Times\" passed my test with flying colors. I laughed hysterically from start to finish. Each and every scene is innovative, well thought out, and executed with the genius that only Chaplin possessed. Among my favorite scenes are the \"automatic worker-feeding machine\"; the jail scene in the cafeteria when The Tramp accidentally sprinkles cocaine on his food, thinking it is salt; and the roller skating scene in the department store. No special effects or computer animation, just pure, simple, genius.The storyline in \"Modern Times\" is purposefully naive, a trick Chaplin used time and again to bring a profound humanitarian quality to his films. Watching this film is comparable to watching a Warner Bros. cartoon, which coming from me is a sincere compliment. The level of physical comedy in \"Modern Times\" is on par with the masterful short films of Chuck Jones, Friz Freleng, and others.Finally, as was the case with most of his later films, \"Modern Times\" is a serious social commentary. Its message is as relevant today as it was more than sixty years ago when it was released. In fact, it is arguably even more relevant today, and unless the world changes drastically in the future it will continue to be. \"Modern Times\" is essentially the story of a simple but extremely kind man caught in the traps of industrialized society. The opening scene, which compares a crowd of workers boarding the subway to a flock of sheep, is Chaplin's warning against standardization, mechanization, and other facets of life which rob men and women of their individuality. Chaplin always tried to speak for the downtrodden, because despite his enormous success and wealth, he never forgot where he came from. In the end, \"Modern Times\" is a reminder that no matter how bad things are, you can still smile. Charles Chaplin has made more people smile than almost any other, and his legacy of love and laughter lives on in his films. Its up to us to keep his legacy alive.",

            "content": "By 1936, Charles Chaplin was already an anachronism \u0096 albeit, an anachronism who was also treasured as an artistic genius. The arrival of 'The Jazz Singer (1927)' did little to curb the director's enthusiasm for silent cinema, and, though he considered at length the commercial implications of converting to synchronised sound, his first film in the \"talkie\" age was almost completely silent (Chaplin compromised by composing a musical score). Nevertheless, the critical and commercial response to 'City Lights (1931)' was strong, reaffirming Chaplin's status as a cinematic master, and vindicating his decision to linger with an otherwise extinct medium. Thus, 'Modern Times (1936)' was to follow in the same mould, despite a synchronised soundtrack which includes a musical score, sound effects and several lines of spoken dialogue (always spoken through a mechanical \"barrier,\" such as a record-player, radio or loudspeaker). The film is historically significant in that it was Chaplin's first overtly political work, raising concerns inspired both by the economic hardship of the Great Depression, and Chaplin's growing interest in socialism.The title 'Modern Times' is used to deliberate ironic effect. Traditionally, to be modern was to be at the forefront of human progress, a step forwards in Man's noble attempt to assert his dominance over his environment; in short, to further distinguish our species from the lower animals. Yet Chaplin believed that such widespread industrialisation was a step backwards for society. Even from the opening shot, he draws comparisons between the hustling crowds of factory workers travelling to work, and a flock of sheep being herded through a corral. The dehumanisation caused by the workers' monotonous factory work is played for maximum comedic effect, with Chaplin's Tramp eventually driven to a nervous breakdown by Frederick Taylor's apathetic brand of scientific management. In these conditions, direct human interaction is minimal, and almost always channelled through an mechanical mediator. In a scene predating Orwell's \"Nineteen-Eighty Four (1949),\" Chaplin is reprimanded by a telescreen in the bathroom, the image of his boss looming overhead like the spectre of Big Brother.Chaplin may also have been remarking upon the rise of the Hollywood studio system, which by then employed a comparable assembly-line approach to film-making. Chaplin, who was given full artistic control through his co-ownership of United Artists, worked in complete opposition to these practices, though it could be argued that his perfectionism and often improvisational style was so inefficient that only an artist as wealthy as he could have gotten away with it. Truth be told, there's nothing particularly distinguished about Chaplin's direction \u0096 despite his strong reliance upon actions over words, his silent films were never as visually accomplished as that of Murnau or Lang, for example. However, his greatest talents as a filmmaker were concerned with the plight of people, and, however much sentimentality he liked to dish out, there can be no doubt that, in Chaplin's characters, one found individuals with whom they shared a very real human bond, of empathy and compassion. For all the director's criticism of modern society, he possessed a genuine belief in the value of human spirit.When Chaplin came under fire for alleged \"communist sympathies\" in the late 1940s, the content of 'Modern Times' was scrutinised for evidence to support the allegations. Certainly, within the director's distaste for industrialisation one may discern an underlying dissatisfaction with capitalism, but Chaplin was definitely not a communist; after all, a prime motivation in his choosing to continue producing silent films was to retain his commercial popularity in foreign-language markets \u0096 that's the capitalist spirit! Nevertheless, Chaplin was eerily prescient when he included a scene in which his Tramp is falsely accused of being a communist, mirroring his own intense political troubles, which concluded in 1952 with the retraction of his US re-entry visa. Though he was initially hesitant about breaking his screen silence, as Chaplin's political convictions grew, so too did his desire to have himself heard. For that, he would, however reluctantly, have to embrace the technology of sound, and, for a mouthpiece, he would choose the most hated man in Europe.",

            "content": "There is something fundamentally sad about Modern Times, by the very fact that it shows an unparalleled genius making his last move in the now-defunct art form with which he made his name. Charlie Chaplin, undisputed master of silent comedy, had managed to bluff his way through the awkward early days of sound, but by 1936 the talkie had got its act together, and screen comedy was dominated by the witty wordplay of the Marx brothers and the smart sass of screwball. Slapstick had all but lost its market, and the picture is saturated with a feel of \"One last time\u0085\" And Chaplin expresses his feelings with scathing satire. Modern Times is quite plainly a blast at many aspects of industrialised living, especially unemployment and Fordist production management. However the picture also takes several sly swipes at sound film itself. From the beginning, sound is associated with the mechanical, the authoritative, and the austere, with the few bits of spoken dialogue being via some piece of technology such as a radio or the boss's speaking tube. Sound effects too are reserved for nasty clanking and scraping sounds of machinery and things breaking apart. Finally there is Paulette Godard's pronouncement that \"The words don't matter\" as Charlie forgets the lyrics for his singing waiter act. Chaplin was of course very good at nonsense voices, as this and his Adenoid Hynkel act in The Great Dictator demonstrate, whereas meaningful verbal comedy was his Achilles Heel.Despite all this vehemence, Chaplin is making one or two concessions to contemporary cinema. Modern Times features a lot more camera movement and close-ups than we see in his previous pictures, where he tended to stick to static long shots to preserve the best flow of physical comedy. The more technical approach here is always done for a reason \u2013 for example whip-panned close-ups are used for emphasis, and there is often a change of angle to punctuate a gag such as the half-built ship slipping out of dock. While they do draw attention to the funniest moments they disrupt the purity of the routine and are most likely concessions made by Chaplin for an audience not used to silent comedy. Modern Times is also much more variable and fast-paced than previous Chaplin features, skipping from factory to prison to department store and so on.And yet, of all his feature films, Modern Times includes perhaps the most protracted bouts of silent comedy, far more than the story-driven City Lights. Despite its linking plot, the various settings in which the little tramp finds himself each provide fully-fledged slapstick routines, and there are very few moments in which point or poignancy are allowed to overrule the comedy. The picture is in some ways like a compendium of the non-stop gagging two-reelers he was making in the 1910s. Modern Times may not be quite the tearjerker that The Kid or City Lights were, but it is the master's final great showcase of his primary talent.",

The owner picks him out for testing the automatic feeding machine. By late afternoon, he gets lost in the machinery. He can't stop tightening causing great damage and they send him to a mental hospital. He gets out but he doesn't have a job anymore. A red flag falls off the back of a truck. He picks it and a massive march starts behind him without he knowing it. The police grabs him thinking that he's the leader. In prison, he helps thwart an escape attempt and is released. A Gamin (Paulette Goddard) is stealing food for the children. Her unemployed father is shot dead leaving her little sisters sent off to the orphanage. She steals a loaf of bread and runs into the Tramp. He tries to take the blame but she's caught anyways. He prefers life inside and deliberately gets caught stealing. They get thrown into the same wagon and escape getting thrown out together.This has the iconic factory scene with the Tramp in the machinery happening early on. The story is slightly random as the pair has one misadventure after another as they struggle to have the American dream. The Tramp is making a statement of sorts as he gets swept up from one thing to the next. He's the cog that never really fits in the machinery. This is a sound movie with sound being used for specific and interesting ways. The Tramp is actually singing but it's a lot of non-sense.

When it's over and you recall the number of sight gags and magic sequences Chaplin has packed into 85 minutes, it is incredible - the conveyer belt and nut turning; Chaplin caught in the cogwheels; the feeding machine; the Red Flag march; the \"nose powder\"; the roller skating ballet; the waiter with tray caught up in the dance (my favourite); the gibberish song - and many more. Then there is his mixing of silent and sound techniques, making the best of both worlds, not falling between stools as some directors might have done.Of course, there is also a political and social dimension; many of the scenes refer to the impact of technical advances, of bureaucracy, and of the then current depression, on the ordinary \"little man\". And it is the little man, the individual caught up in society's complex machinery, whom Chaplin championed. He may have sympathised with left-wing political parties and unions in so far as they supported ordinary working people, but Chaplin's essential beliefs are enshrined in the final \"words\" and shot, with him telling Paulette Godard, that she should keep smiling, they will get along, as they walk, a couple of individuals, into an uncertain future. Beyond politics, the individual has to rely on his or her own resources and spirit to survive.",

            "content": "I was actually about to completely write off this movie until I actually realised the genius that went into creating it. In a way Hollywood simply does not make movies like this any more, particularly where the creative genius of Charlie Chaplin is the writer, director, and star of the show. Sure, Chaplin is one of those actors that I have heard a lot about \u2013 he is one of the greats of the early years of Hollywood \u2013 but I never paid much attention to him believing that the only decent movies of the silent era came out of Germany (and to an extent Russia). However, a friend at work was talking about a film called The Dictator and a part of me decided that maybe it was time to actually sit down and see what Charlie Chaplin was all about. Well, I have to admit that I am glad that I did.The film itself doesn't have a plot, but rather is about the struggles of two people in the great depression and an age where technology is taking all of the jobs. However, Chaplin is a genius in how we satirises everything about modern life from automation, crazy inventions, the union movement, and even communism. On one level it simply seems to be nothing more than slapstick, though it is one of those movies that you have to take a step back and think about what is being said to really understand the true satire that Modern Times actually is \u2013 in a way it works on two levels, the slapstick for the lowest common denominator, and the satire of those who are actually willing to sit down and think about what is going on. Even then the slapstick itself is really clever \u2013 I am not going to forget the scene where he carries a tray into a restaurant to have everybody suddenly pile onto the dancefloor and then getting carried away with the crowd.What really impressed me was how versatile they were when it came to making silent films. Sure, by this time they had started to produce talkies, and you could tell that this film did have a sound track (and Chaplin even sings), however it is clear that you don't actually need sound, or even a lot of words, to be able to see the action that is happening, and to work out what is being said despite the fact that no words are coming out of the actor's mouth \u2013 only their lips are moving. In a way this type of film is actually far, far superior than many of the films that we see floating around today with all the great computerised special effects and clever stunt doubles. In fact all of the stunts in this movie would have been performed by Chaplin without any special effects whatsoever.Yet it is also interesting to see how much hasn't changed. In a way we look back in the days of our parents and grandparents and see a world where everybody had a job, and that you could drop out of school at year ten and walk straight into a career. It was also a world where people had money, and things were much more peaceful. However, Modern Times gives us a different glimpse into the great depression, where automation was taking all the jobs, and that unless you were skilled you were unable to find employment. Also notice how people are being sent to gaol simply for stealing a loaf of bread, but not only that but people will actually pursue somebody who is only trying to feed themselves. Yet we also have that dream of home ownership \u2013 and in a way it is painted that owning a home is a sign of wealth, a sign of achieving the American Dream \u2013 and the ending is interesting in that it gives the idea that no matter where you land up the dream is still alive.Having a job is a key to living the dream \u2013 as we see with the heroine. When Chaplin gets out of gaol the third time (it seems that he is always landing up in gaol \u2013 as if ending up there is just a part of life, however it is also just a minor inconvenience on the road to living the dream), she has found herself a job, and is now dressed well, and has possessions. In a way that reminded me of when I got my first job \u2013 suddenly I had money that I could spend, and I could go down to the shop and impulse buy an Iron Maiden T-Shirt. However, there is a catch, something that is not indicated in the movie, and that is the trap that the modern society creates \u2013 to survive you must work, but once you start working you suddenly have access to credit, and what credit, or more so debt, does is that entraps you in that daily cycle of forever going to work.Yet we also have the capitalist idea of forever producing more and becoming more efficient. The factory bosses are looking for ways to cut down on break times, so they create an automated feeding machine (which basically doesn't work). Then we have the assembly line going faster, and faster, and faster, until poor old Chaplin has a nervous breakdown and eventually sees bolts everywhere that must be turned. Yet this is still the case today, where employers are looking for more and better ways to become more efficient, to get more out of workers, and to eventually increase the bottom line. This is more so since, like in Chaplin's day, we have entered a period of a new normal after the Great Recession.",

Maybe not his funniest but his best because there's so much more to it than the Keystone Kops kind of pratfalls that he so commonly used.Frankly I don't know how the guy did it, being so consistently humorous without using any words.  All of it depends on a story simple enough to be followed visually and on Chaplin's genius for mime and situation construction.  There ARE some words spoken on screen -- this was his last holdout against talking pictures -- but none of them involve people speaking directly to one another.  There is a song at the end with gibberish lyrics. And the rest of the speaking is always filtered through some mechanical medium, a record player, a radio, a television set.  Charlie was accused of communism somewhere along the line and pretty much thrown out of the country, after which he lived in Switzerland.  You couldn't tell he was a Commie from this movie.  It comments on its time, of course, the Great Depression, and Charlie and Paulette Goddard are two poor people.  Management is shown as callus, playing with a jigsaw puzzle and reading newspapers while the workers slave away on the assembly line.  There is even a communist demonstration.  But it's all played for laughs.  One of those red warning flags falls off the back of a truck passing down an empty street.  Charlie picks up the flag and waves it, shouting after the truck. As he begins to hurry after the truck, still shouting and waving, a horde of dissatisfied workers silently falls in behind him and he's arrested.  Poor people steal, but they only steal food.  If having sympathy for the unemployed is communism then roughly one American out of three was a communist, because that's roughly what the unemployment rate was.  \"Modern Times\" is no more communistic than, say, \"My Man Godfrey\" or \"Salt of the Earth\" or \"The Grapes of Wrath.\"  Besides that, Charlie is no classical Marxist.  Marxism posited a transition from \"false consciousness\" (the feeling that one's miserable poverty was due to personal failure or bad luck) to \"class consciousness\" (the realization that exploitation by the property owners was at fault).  Charlie is no activist.  He fumbles every job he gets.  The other workers are hardly sympathetic.  Charlie's not a working class hero but a black sheep.  The opening shot of the herd of sheep hurrying past the camera includes one black sheep in the middle of the flock and it's hard to imagine that this was accidental.Actually, Charlie had lost a lot of respect in America because he had an eye for young girls.  His second marriage resulted from a sixteen-year-old girl's (faked) pregnancy.  Paulette Goddard, who became his third wife, maybe and maybe not, was twenty when this movie was made, and Charlie was forty-three.  In any case -- boy, if you want to get Americans heated up just combine sex with politics.  A sure-fire winner for the puritans.  (It may have cost Goddard the part of Scarlet O'Hara in \"Gone With the Wind\" because she may have been living in sin with Charlie at the time.)I don't want to spell out too many of the gags because I don't want to spoil them but be alert for the feeding machine that goes berserk and shoves lug nuts down Charlie's throat and hits him in the face with a corn cob. Charlie looks as if he's strapped helplessly into his seat, but his hands were free under the rotating table so that he could manipulate the fiendish devices himself.  The first time I saw this movie was in the Arts Theater on Springfield Avenue in Irvington, New Jersey.  When Paulette Goddard first appeared, the man on my right chuckled and said, \"Now that's a good-looking babe.\"  On my left, my marmorial ex laughed out loud during the feeding machine episode for perhaps the only time in her life.

The machines seemed to be taking jobs from the actual human beings and this feeling is perfectly conveyed in Charlie Chaplin's great \"Modern Times\".I don't need to go into an in depth analysis to point out the parts of the film that convey these points but the most impressive aspect of this film is how genuinely funny it manages to be while making this point. From the lunch machine and the Tramp's mental breakdown to the entire jail scene, this is by far the funniest Chaplin movie I've seen yet, and one of the funniest silent films I've seen.Speaking of the lunch machine, the film's main point is perhaps portrayed with more clarity and hilarity in this scene than any other scene in the film, and that point is this: Humans aren't machines, and machines aren't perfect, and neither of those should be treated as such.As well as that bit of commentary it has a sweet story involving a young homeless girl and the Tramp and an optimistic ending in which they literally walk off into the sunset. It may sound trite, but in this story there's no telling if they'll be OK, the important thing is that they believe they will and they shouldn't stop trying, and that seems to be the most important thing to Charlie Chaplin, who seems to convey this message in one way or another in every film he makes.",

But aside from a satirical subject matter that has retained its relevance over eighty years since the film was first made, Modern Times is a near perfect example of Chaplin's talents, not just as a performer but also as a director.\nModern Times opens with an intertitle that proclaims that the film is \"A story of industry, of individual enterprise - humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness\", followed by a shot is of a herd of jostling sheep, which cuts to a shot of a herd of jostling workers emerging from the subway. What follows is a blistering satire of industrialised modern life that opens with Chaplin's \"Little Tramp\" character (credited as \"a factory worker\") working on an increasingly fast production line, which soon drives him to a nervous breakdown. Accidentally ending up in prison, he soon decides that he prefers it to working in a factory and spends much of his time attempting to get sent back there, as a result of which he meets a girl - the Gamin - with whom he becomes romantically involved. Once together, the Tramp and the Gamin conclude that they can only achieve their dream of domestic happiness by finding employment, but it never quite works out for them...\nChaplin was a something of a polymath: not only did he star in Modern Times, he also produced, directed, wrote it and composed the score. The film was made at a time when talkies had more or less consigned silent movies to history, but he made the movie mostly silent because he reportedly believed that the Little Tramp wouldn't work in a talkie (we actually hear his voice in this, his final film, but only when he memorable sings in a gibberish). It's a not a true silent film and Chaplin makes use of diagetic sound, often for comic effect. Whilst he's mostly remembered by the public at large as one of the great silent screen clowns, Chaplin's talents as a director were prodigious: Modern Times is a masterful demonstration of his mise-en-sc\u00e9ne, boasting some truly remarkable props and sets, many of them featuring moving parts which form a key part of the film's funniest moments. The feeding machine is a particularly good example, as are the conveyor belt and the huge assemblies of cogs and wheels in which he and others get ensnared; less immediately obvious but just as impressive is the shack that the Little Tramp and the Gamin move into, with parts rigged to break and collapse on cue.\nChaplin's almost peerless grasp of physical comedy is on display throughout and it remains a very funny masterpiece of perfectly choreographed slapstick. It's enhanced by the fact that Chaplin shot the film at 18 frames per second and then projected parts of it at 24 frames per second, making key scenes seem even more hectic and chaotic, and along with the film's sound (or lack of it) this demonstrates Chaplin bringing the techniques of silent movies into the talkie era for artistic effect. His musical score is the icing on the cake, perfectly suited as it is to each and every scene.\nThe rest of the cast, mostly regular Chaplin collaborators, contribute to the film's polish by playing their parts straight around his clowning and doing so impeccably, with Chaplin's then-wife Paulette Goddard giving an utterly charming performance as Ellen Peterson, a.k.a. the Gamin. The end result is a beautifully made and very funny film, but one that is also angry, showing people driven to crime and forced to live in hovels by low wages and unemployment, and often daring (the scene in which the Tramp accidentally takes cocaine - with hilarious results - was technically forbidden by the Hays Code at the time). It certainly isn't the only Chaplin film worth watching, but it is nonetheless one of his very best and one of the finest film comedies ever made.",

            "content": "A delightful film with one great scene after another, Charlie Chaplin's \"Modern Times\" is hilarious, thoughtful, and timeless.  Chaplin combined his silent film skills with creative use of sound effects and music, and added a wide variety of interesting and entertaining settings, to create a film that is very pleasing to watch.  Chaplin's own fine acting is complemented by a delightful and charming performance by Paulette Goddard.  And the story itself, filled with twists and turns, is a timeless commentary on \"modern\" life, much of which is applicable to any era.Charlie's \"Tramp\" character joins up in this one with a lively, orphaned gamin (Goddard) to help each other through a lengthy series of setbacks and triumphs that reflect the stresses of fast-paced modern life.  Most of their adventures are hilarious, but many also contain serious social commentary that is still just as relevant in any age.  Chaplin and Goddard make a delightful pair who win the complete sympathy of the viewer in their fight for survival.The movie has one great scene after another, from some wild sequences in a steel factory, to a set of sometimes breath-taking antics in a deserted department store, to the incomparable climactic sequence in a cafe, and many others in between.  The settings are done with great care and wit, and the action makes full use of the props and possibilities at hand.This is a wonderful movie that anyone who likes vintage cinema will enjoy. Even those who are thoroughly jaded by the excesses of modern cinema should at least give \"Modern Times\" a try.  This is one of the great masterpieces of Chaplin's or any other era.",

Pure creative genius. Plus you have the usual emotional content. Chaplin's previous classics - The Kid, The Gold Rush, The Circus, City Lights - all had these and are fantastic movies.However, Modern Times trumps all those. Not only is it hilariously funny and bitter-sweet but it has social commentary too. Chaplin takes aim at the dehumanizing effect of factory work, and the general way workers are treated. While the picture he paints makes us laugh, rather than make us angry, behind the comedy there is a lot of truth. This satire is still relevant today. It doesn't have to be factories, it could be any workplace.Superb direction by Chaplin. He is more known for his acting antics and creative scripts but the camera-work here is fantastic.Other than the all-round Chaplin brilliance, the other standout in the movie is Paulette Goddard, who plays his love interest. Beautiful with an endearing waifishness, impishness and sense of humour, she matches Chaplin step for step. (She was to become Chaplin's third wife shortly after the movie was released).An all-time classic.",

            "content": "This is an interesting historical film. When it came out in 1936, the Depression was at its height and unemployment was rampant. Because of this, Socialism, Communism and unions were all on the rise. Considering how poor everyone was, these seemed like pretty attractive alternatives. This film was actually a radical political/social message wrapped up in comedy set in the very near future--if it had been presented as a drama, there's a good chance Hollywood would not have made the film. It's about the dehumanization of the worker and this movie as well as Chaplin's political leanings would later come back to haunt him during the Red Scare.But, back to the movie. This film is essentially a series of vignettes all strung together with a schmaltzy plot. It's a shame really, as all the vignettes are good but the plot that connects them is by far the weakest part of the film--partly because Paulette Goddard was NOT a teenager (she was just way too old to play the part) and partly because the moments between her and Chaplin tended to be the slowest and most saccharine in the film. Now I am not saying it's a bad film--far from it. It's just that this element is not the best aspect of the film. Chaplin's timing and athleticism is actually the star of the movie. The film is incredible to watch as he roller skates, glides through AMAZING looking machinery and almost dances through the film. It's a wonderful film technically and fun to watch.PPS--only a few weeks after I first wrote this review, I have seen about 8 more Chaplin movies. After each one, my appreciation for his talents increased. In hindsight, I think a score of 9 is more in order. While it's true I'm not much for pathos, I must acknowledge his amazing talents.",

The factory scenes and the skating scene in the department store are just two of the highlights--but all the way through he combines his physical dexterity with warmth as the Tramp struggles to survive in a world gone mad with new technology.And his partner in this happy excursion is PAULETTE GODDARD, a striking young beauty who a few years later almost won the role of Scarlett O'Hara in GWTW.The print TCM is showing is flawless and there is pure delight in watching Chaplin and Goddard romp through a series of vignettes that come together to produce a well-paced story where no dialogue is needed to tell the simple tale. Keeping the running time down to an hour and a half is an asset here--especially in an age where most major comedies are often told in two hours or more.Chaplin's background music is a good counterpoint to the visuals, although one wishes that one of his themes for the scenes where he cheers up the gamin (and later recorded as a hit song called \"Smile\"), had been given a more lavish treatment.Trivia note: GLORIA de HAVEN can be seen as Paulette Goddard's young sister.

            "review_title": "maybe not as entirely, artistically fulfilling as City Lights, but it might just be funnier",
            "content": "Charlie Chaplin is a true master of at least a few things, and all within a specific world that he's created and fully culminates in City Lights and, even more notably in Modern Times: he has running gags all over the place (his 'Tramp' character getting involved in that is), including always being an unintentional klutz by way of too many people or too much to get acclimated to with the machines and other little things in the world, and somehow getting into trouble and being thrown into jail. But there's also a lyricism to it too, a sense of pure whimsy that while it has been aspired to by the likes of De Sica and even Benigni (the former has probably gotten the closest and topped Chaplin's style), has rarely been matched. Modern Times is a very fine example of Chaplin's world, and when I wasn't laughing myself silly, aside from a couple of notable moments with the Gamin, I had a big goofy smile on my face, which in the end is Chaplin's main message (his final words, unspoken of course, are 'come on, smile). No matter what happens, there's always a good heart somewhere in Chaplin's work, probably one of the purest too.While I could argue about which one of Chaplin's great films, this and City Lights, triumphs more on the basis of being more memorable or not in terms of showing the sense of prevailing loneliness and despair, Modern Times ends up working so wonderfully in its comedy and absurdism that I would at least be more inclined to say this film is funnier. Sometimes I couldn't believe how ingenious the touches got, and it often was accompanied with a precursor- I often said a 'oh no, here we go again' before a gag I knew was coming, like when the tramp is eating a meal in prison and puts too much \"salt\" on his food (really a secret nose powder, a hilarious allusion to cocaine), or when he gets sprayed by the alcohol barrels (while still wearing roller skates he found in the toy story). I also couldn't get enough of the moment when working as the assistant in the steel mill he gets his supervisor stuck in the gears of the machine, only to break for lunch and though not getting him out right away, does do his best to keep the man sated with food. Or a little mishap that sends an unfinished boat sailing off, or getting a chicken stuck in a lamp in the buzz of a restaurant...And so and so forth. Chaplin puts his character- and his lady in the form of a 'Gamin' played brilliantly and charmingly by Paulette Goddard- in the time frame of the title. Not just with what happens at work with the introduction of new technology, and the insanity of the industrial age (another tiny running gag- the tramp can't stop moving his body even after he stops turning the screws), but the social side as well. It's sad that the United States immediately called Chaplin a communist, because for all of Chaplin's sympathies and depictions of the working class in the film, he's always playful in mocking the wealthy and considering the time frame (it was the depression after all, I'm sure more than few could relate to having a shabby house like the tramp and gamin get). There's the sense in the film too of how modern something like a union march or a strike are, and in general I got the sense that Chaplin was out to mock the dangers of going too far with the processes of industrial age and all, and of the added authorities that goes with it, not capitalism itself.Besides, Chaplin's sense of morality is meant to be a given- if one's seen City Lights one can see it even clearer and stronger there. The same poetry of that film might only come out in spurts here, like when the tramp has to sing for the restaurant crowd, or the last scene. But it's really how Chaplin pushes the boundaries of the absurd in a manner that's never meant to be too mean or cruel (even with the police he gets his jabs at them in a playful manner). The use of sound and music are also extraordinary here, as the only time we hear voices, aside from the singing, are through mediums, and also the sounds of gun-shots. There aren't any gray areas in Chaplin's black & white world, but then there isn't any need for them, if anything it would shatter the atmosphere and innocence of the main characters. And even set in the 30s, it hasn't aged much at all; it's very likely one of the great comedies of its time, or any time.",

This one is superficially similar, but not nearly as enjoyable or novel.Yes, the factory sets are well architected to participate in Chaplin's ballet. Yes, the then current Mrs Chaplin has an aggressive feline sensuality. Yes, Charlie's energetic approach and commitment is admirable. Yes, this is highly visual, especially compared to the word gags of the Marxes. But too many elements have become already formulaic.In `City,' there was a clear dependency of concept, clear to us as viewer but built into the story as well: we knew that at root this was a coherent statement coming from one mind rather than the common case, films designed by committee.we knew that the goal was to amuse us in the tradition of the British stage: fun at all costs using clever extensions of extremely familiar notions and techniques. The world of abstractions into which we agreeable enter was known beforehand and part of the amusement; how they are bent is part of the amusement.clearly subservient to all this was the creation of the character in a context of social situations. The relative importance of those was important: `City' was intended as a creative endeavor whose success depended on a collaboration between him and what we brought. But look what has happened to `Modern.' The situation: the Tramp, the technology  and personal context of the movie, social injustice all have taken on lives of their own and become additional participants in the contract. No longer can we `let our guard down' and participate. Now we have to worry about how to receive the `message' of the movie.In this project, the hierarchy is all reversed. There is an element of overt social commentary, something that would become even more evident with the Hitler film. But there it is so bold and imaginative it is admirable in its own right.There is also the elevation of the familiar over the novel. There is no innovation here, in fact the whole idea is to emphasize the familiar. He himself is guilty of the same mechanical thinking he criticizes.\nThat's the strange thing for me: the same recipe in two films with the slightest variation on emphasis: one is transcendental, the other amusingly troubled.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

Chaplin hilarious slapstick comedy is also present in this film while still keeping serious undertones. The best example of this is the eating machine. This particular scene was a perfect representation of the problems in our society (a machine meant to further regiment the day of a worker only to break in the process) while also causing a laugh out loud reaction. My favorite part of this film is definitely the ending in which Chaplin sings a song and dances. What makes this scene so great is not only the fact that it was the first time Chaplin/The Tramp ever spoke but that it was also a stance against \"talkies\". Although Chaplin sings the lyrics are complete gibberish but the audience understands regardless.

You never get the feeling you're being lectured about anything, you're laughing too much.The element of tragedy lurking in the background makes the comedy that much stronger. When Paulette Godard comes into the picture, the tone changes from industrial to romantic.

            "content": "\"A story of industry, of individual enterprise - humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness\" \u0085 In the opening scene we see a herd of moving sheep which morphs into a mass of humanity (the working class) rushing to work in the early morning. Everyone in the throng is anonymous, like a vision of 1927's \"Metropolis.\" In the president's office of a modern factory, the Electro Steel Company, the magnate occupies himself with a puzzle and reads his newspaper. He turns on his closed-circuit television to check out his workers in the vast complex (yes, TV was already available in the 1930s although its use was limited).Our hero Charlie is struggling to keep up his repetitive job on the incredibly fast endless conveyor belt. What is the uncaring mogul's response on the intercom to the turbine operator? \"Mack, section five, more speed!\" Charlie, who tightens bolts on a plate, becomes a nervous wreck, and staggers away on break time. There are absurd moments like the Billows human feeding machine, which is designed to feed men fast without wasting time on an entire lunch hour, improving production. Charlie is the guinea pig, and the machine fails (spilled soup, fast- spinning corn, desert shoved into his face). When he returns to work, his foreman is merciless (work, work, work). Charlie is forced on the conveyor belt into the insides of the gargantuan machine, moving along large gears. Although Charlie is helped out, he becomes a madman. Sent to the psycho ward of a hospital, he has his nervous breakdown cured. He is without a job, however. Trying to avoid excitement in a busy city is difficult, especially with fire engines, traffic noise, crowds, etc. Charlie picks up a flag (likely red) that fell from a lumber truck and inadvertently discovers that he is leading a Communist demonstration. He is promptly arrested.In a parallel story attractive Paulette Goddard (a 30-year old gamin, far too old to play a juvenile) steals bananas at a wharf and hands them out to poor folks. She and two younger sisters (the smaller one is Gloria DeHaven, who grew up to be a beautiful actress) are motherless, with the father unemployed. The depression rages and the girls' father dies in a demonstration. The gamin's two sisters are sent to an orphanage. Meanwhile in prison Charlie is exposed to the effects of \"nose powder\" (cocaine). Subsequently, Charlie thwarts a jail break, an action that first gets him a comfortable cell, and later a pardon. As he is unemployed he does not really want the pardon. While Charlie is walking the city streets, the hungry urchin steals a loaf of bread and runs into him. Charlie and the gamin meet for the first time, and Charlie helps her out of trouble. He takes a fancy to her (as he did in real life). In the meantime Charlie gets a job as a department store night watchman. After hours he lets the waif in, to eat and sleep courtesy of the store (lots of slapstick here, with Charlie floundering on roller skates). Charlie fails after lasting the night and is arrested again.After spending ten days in jail he is released; the gamin is waiting for him. She is thrilled to tell him that she found shelter in an abandoned shack by the ocean. There is more slapstick here: Charlie dives into shallow water; a board falls on his head inside the shack; his chair crashes through the weak floor. When he discovers that factories are reopening, he rushes to one of them and gets a job as a mechanic's helper. The machinery that they work on is as dangerous as they come: huge exposed gears and rollers with no guards or covers (or machinery lock-out procedures in place). The mechanic is soon trapped neck down between gears; Charlie tries to feed him his lunch during the noon break. The message? Machines dominate the working man. Before long the workers strike and there is a riot. Charlie is arrested yet again. Meanwhile our waif gets a job as a dancer in a restaurant/caf\u00e9. Finally, out of her rags, the gamin looks clean and glamorous. After Charlie is released she helps him get a job at the establishment as a singer/waiter. Charlie passes as a singer, but you just know that the duck dinner will not make it to the customer (more slapstick)! They soon lose their jobs, but Charlie tells the scamp to cheer up. In the last scene, as they walk away together from the viewer along the center stripe of a rural road \u2013 two bindle stiffs \u2013 we hope for something optimistic. What will happen to them? Not only does the Tramp not conform to the modern world, but also Chaplin implies that the deck is stacked against the poorer classes. The waddling vagabond himself has no support system: family or funds or stability. As they disappear into the sunset, we say goodbye to the Tramp for all time. Note that Charlie Chaplin, well into his forties, walks away with a supposed teenager. Of course, in real life that's just what he did; Charlie always liked young girls. For instance, at age 54 in 1943 he married Oona O'Neill, who was age 18. The movie has mostly title cards with exceptions. Talkie sounds (sound effects) - that seem to be dubbed recordings, not synchronized sound - come from the radio, intercom, barking dog, Charlie singing, people clapping (but no speech). Chaplin obviously did not enjoy progress; sound killed The Little Tramp. Yet its lack is not detrimental to this particular motion picture. Chaplin \u2013 writer, producer, director, actor \u2013 made only two films per decade from the 1930s through the 1950s, and only five after \"Modern Times.\" All in all, \"Modern times\" is so well done that it probably belongs on USA's Top 100 listing along with \"City Lights\" (1931).",

            "content": "Although \"Modern Times\" was made as late as 1936, nearly a decade after the coming of sound to the cinema, Charlie Chaplin decided to make it a \"silent\" as he had done with his previous film, \"City Lights\" from five years earlier. I place the word \"silent\" in inverted commas because both films make some use of sound; both, for example, have a recorded musical soundtrack. (Chaplin, a gifted musician as well as a comedian, composed this himself, as he did in a number of his films). \"Modern Times\" also has sound effects and a limited amount of spoken dialogue. Chaplin himself does not speak, but does sing a nonsense comic song.There were two reasons for Chaplin's reluctance to embrace the sound revolution. Firstly, he had grown up during the silent era and had become a master of the art of silent comedy, which was very different to verbal comedy. Secondly, he wanted to make films for the whole world, not just for English-speaking ones. \"Modern Times\", however, was to be his last \"silent\"; his next film, \"The Great Dictator\" from 1940, was a fully-fledged talkie.In \"Modern Times\" Chaplin plays his iconic Little Tramp character, now a factory worker on an assembly line. Unable to cope with the work, he suffers a nervous breakdown, and the film then chronicles a further series of misadventures. These are too many and varied for me to write a full synopsis, but the themes which run throughout the film are the Tramp's essential innocence, his inability to cope with the stresses and complexities of life in 1930s America and his love for a girl whom he meets in the course of his adventures. This girl, played by Chaplin's wife Paulette Goddard, is sometimes referred to as \"Ellen\", although in the cast list she is simply referred to as \"a gamin\". (This surprised me. I always thought that \"gamin/gamine\", like \"blond/blonde\" and \"fiance/fiancee\", was one of those French loan-words which always take an extra \"e\" in the feminine, even in English).The most famous scenes in the film are those set in the factory, in which Chaplin satirises the production-line techniques of modern industry. On one level these scenes are highly comic, but they are also serious in that they highlight the way in which each worker's role is reduced to that of repeatedly performing a single unskilled task all day long. Management even begrudged their workforce taking time off for meals; at one point the Tramp is subjected to an experimental \"automatic feeding machine\", designed to do away with the need to lunch breaks by allowing workers to be fed at their posts.Chaplin's critique of the soul-destroying effects of industrialisation led to him being attacked as a \"Communist\", although he was defended by Graham Greene, who stated \"Chaplin presents, he doesn't offer political solutions\".Chaplin was certainly on the Left, but it is important to note that his satire was directed at the modern world in general, not just America. This was, after all, the period when many Leftists were praising Stalin for industrialising the Soviet Union, using production and management techniques borrowed from Western capitalism. Yet, although factory work may have been dehumanising, during the Great Depression people considered themselves lucky to have work of any kind, something emphasised in the film when we see a demonstration by unemployed workers. (The Tramp inadvertently gets caught up in it and is mistakenly arrested).\"Modern Times\" is a difficult film to categorise. It has been described as a black comedy, a description which is apt if one takes that phrase to mean comedy with a serious edge, less so if one understands it as an attempt to get humour from cynical bad taste. It is certainly a comedy, a film in which Chaplin was able to use his finely honed silent comic skills to great effect. (Apart from the factory scenes, I loved the scene where the Tramp roller-skates on the edge of a steep drop without ever falling off, an effect achieved by the use of trompe l'oeil painting). It is also, undoubtedly, a political and social satire. Yet the Tramp is more than just a figure of fun, more than just a political symbol. He is also a recognisable human being and a symbol of our common humanity, the little man who always manages to find hope even in seemingly desperate situations. As he says at the very end of the film: \"Buck up - never say die. We'll get along\". 9/10.",

            "content": "'Modern Times (1936)' is considered to be the last American 'Silent Film', made long after the era had essentially come to a close. It's fitting, then, that some use of sound seeps into the piece and usually signifies the modernisation of society, machines replacing man and bringing audio with them. It also gives us the first taste of The Tramp's voice, as he is forced into an uncomfortable situation simply to find work - though the song he sings is gibberish to keep the scene universally understandable. This picture is perhaps Chaplin's finest silent work because it not only has a message, taking a stance against the industrialisation of the workforce and its replacement by unthinking machines, but is also riotously entertaining throughout. It puts a smile on your face in the first scene and keeps it there until the last. Each slapstick set-piece comes incredibly close to brilliance, with a few easily crossing that threshold, and the feature is funny in the way only a film of this kind could be. It really is effortlessly entertaining and endlessly enjoyable, remaining a purely visual treat from beginning to end with some fantastic themes and inventive scenes. There isn't really a moment that doesn't work and the Tramp remains as endearing as ever. It's made even better because of its underlying point, one that is all the more relevant today and was actually somewhat clairvoyant, and is certainly one of the most purely cinematic pictures I've ever seen. It's a proper Chaplin classic. 8/10",

            "content": "The final scene in 'Modern Times' is stunning, and in many ways. There is a message of hope amidst the poverty of the Depression, with Chaplin's responding to Goddard feeling overwhelmed and defeated by saying \"Buck up - never say die. We'll get along!\" (and lip-reading after that, perhaps \"Smile, C'mon!\"). We then see his signature move, walking off down the road, but this time he isn't alone, he has Goddard with him, which could be viewed as overcoming through love and togetherness, or perhaps Chaplin's real-life marriage to her. The most tingly interpretation for me, however, is as a symbol of end of the silent era. Chaplin retired his the character of the Tramp with this film, and while he uses sound in some very creative ways, it's mostly silent. Long after almost all other movies had become talkies, when I see this iconic character walking off down the road, I really feel like it's a final good-bye to an era, which gives me goosebumps.Chaplin is also absolutely brilliant in the film's very impressive opening scene. He's an assembly line worker who tightens bolts to some non-descript part as they rapidly stream by, having to work very hard to keep up. He and his fellow workers have been made into machines, watched over with technology ahead of its time, with his boss able to see and talk to him via giant monitors, including one in the washroom. In a hilarious scene, his boss uses him as the guinea pig for a new device meant to improve efficiency - an automated feeding machine. Chaplin is strapped in and must endure the machine going haywire through various courses of a meal. It's one of the funniest sequences I've ever seen. The film seems like it may be heading for a critique of automation, with Chaplin dehumanized, humiliated, suffering from repetitive motion, and breaking down, but it expands in to more than that.Through the character of a gamin (Paulette Goddard), we see the poverty of the times. It's ironic that the efforts made by engineers to develop an automated feeding machine are soon followed by Goddard stealing bananas for poor children and her family. It seems to be saying that the best minds should be working less on maximizing corporate profits by attempting to automate the most basic of human activities, eating, and more on making sure that everyone has enough to eat. Eating is a recurring theme in the film, with machines 'swallowing up' workers at times, and a thief explaining \"we ain't burglars - we're hungry.\" Chaplin realizes at one point that he's better off locked up in prison, where he has a place to sleep and gets fed.The film touches on other aspects of the times. Chaplin is inadvertently swept up into socialist strikes. He also accidentally consumes some \"nose candy\", and in a very amusing, cocaine-fueled frenzy, he stops other prisoners from escaping. Later he'll also accidentally drink a lot of rum. In addition to the comedic effect these things have, perhaps it's showing us that sometimes people are just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and that while socialism and drugs are such serious topics, there is a silliness to the things we do. The House Un-American Activities Committee took a dimmer view, however, believing the film to be further evidence of Chaplin being a communist. It's ironic, because if you think about it, Chaplin's character doesn't really have a problem with getting jobs, he just loses them (usually through incompetence), and his message at the end is one of hope. He's not saying let's overthrow the wealthy and levelize society, he's just saying let's treat people with humanity and respect, including those at the bottom of society.While it has social commentary, the film feels very lighthearted, and has many charming moments. Chaplin is a very graceful roller skater during an extended sequence, and has some funny dance moves. His 'nonsense' song towards the end is fantastic, and I was impressed that he also composed the film's score, which is quite catchy and was the basis for the Nat King Cole song 'Smile'. There are of course slapstick elements and pratfalls peppered throughout, some of which work better than others. Overall, it's a brilliant film by a true giant in the industry, and a must-view.",

            "content": "Somehow, this very old film is particularly modern today and the exaggerations are not really sooo extreme compared with the real world. The humans, enslaved by the machines and by those who control them, become more and more small and insignificant, like the hero of this very funny comedy (one of the best in the history) that speaks about very ugly things in a very amusing way. The Tramp, is not a tramp in the beginning. He has a real job in a modern factory, that almost kills him, as the factory becomes more and more modern. He becomes a tramp when he stays without a job. Picking up red flags in the street can get you in a big problem with the police, who are there to serve and protect the rich. An honest man can stay honest even in prison and get benefits from this. Even a new job. But honesty is not really enough. Trouble is always around the corner and modern society doesn't permit you to make a new start easily.Love gives you wings, or at list hope and the power to continue. A beautiful girl of the streets is more than our hero is asking for and he is ready to do whatever necessary. Even put his safety in danger to take care of her. And she, appreciates this. In the end, when everything is lost once again, all they are left with, is each other and that's all they really need.For the first time is his cinema career, our Tramp will find a girl that will stick with him and support him. (Chaplin obviously felt with Paulette Goddard something that he didn't feel for his earlier women, and I don't blame him).And this story of modern times, like all of Chaplin's films will end up with an optimistic feeling in a unhappy end. Never is everything lost.With obvious inspiration from Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\" and maybe Ren\u00e9 Clair's \"\u00c0 nous la libert\u00e9\", it made the strongest point about THE where we 're going, in all the cinema of the 30's (I think) 8) and with only Marx bros' \"Duck soup\" being able to stand anywhere close to it. Maybe the most complete, funny and mature creation of the best comedian of the seventh art, with a lot more than a non stop production line of great jokes to offer. If made without a single joke, this film would still be one of the greatest of all of our modern times.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (1936) is the final film to feature the great actor/director/writer's most easily recognizable incarnation: The Tramp. Here is a character that is so ingrained in the collective conscious of modern film audiences that many recognize him despite the fact that they have not seen a single Chaplin film. Indeed, several iconographic studies have labeled The Tramp (with his worn hat, distinctive mustache, dusty suit, cane, and trademark waddle) as the single most identifiable fictional image in history.Still, the film that perhaps most influenced the creation and thematic realization of Modern Times was not even a silent one. The Jazz Singer, which debuted in 1927, five years before Modern Times began production, is perhaps the most important watershed film in the industry's century-old history. In the film, comic great Al Jolson stands up in front of the audience and...sings. And as Millard Mitchell said in Singin' in the Rain, the public was suddenly in a frenzy for \"Talking pictures! Talking pictures!\" Sadly, with the advent of synchronized sound and dialogue, the world of silent filmmaking began to slip into obscurity with audiences and studios now viewing it as obsolete and undesirable. Nevertheless, Chaplin continued his passion for the subtle craft by creating City Lights (1931), which many critics and academics consider one of the greatest films ever made, but by the time Modern Times was released, Chaplin was one of the last directors left clinging to a dying art.Modern Times is not an entirely silent film, (there are dialogue snippets and sound effects), but if you look closely, every character with dialogue (excluding Chaplin himself) is being mocked. Even when The Tramp opens his mouth (the only time he ever did so in a film), the words are nonsensical, defying the burgeoning convention that dialogue is mandatory for substance, entertainment, and quality.Despite the film's status as one of the greatest comedies of all-time, it is hard to ignore the political component. In his movies, Chaplin often exhibited a great mistrust for authority and progress, as often embodied through the social elite, the police, and wealthy entrepreneurs. The irony of the film's title, then, is two-fold. It connects with Chaplin's own bitter feelings regarding his moribund art form, but also refers to the plight of the working classes during the Great Depression (long working hours with little job security and meager salary, while the upper classes remain wealthy and bide their idle time) The world was changing fast, and Chaplin foresaw that many of these changes were far from beneficial.As we watch The Tramp struggle through the modern, mechanized world, we laugh at his antics and the absurdity of their results, but we can also feel pain and pity. He is clearly a man who does not belong. Indeed, The Tramp can almost be thought of as a misfit who has passed through a membrane from some alternate reality and unwittingly fallen into our familiar world (notice that he does not have a name or identification of any kind, and as far as we know, he has no friends, family, funds, or history).He takes on assembly lines, feeding machines, department stores, policemen and various other mass-oriented aspects of the industrialized world (all which demand and exhibit sameness and conformity), but The Tramp (and his symbolic extension, the individual) never seem to fit.This is, consequently, why Modern Times is also one of the most poignant love stories ever put on film. The only character who is on the same level as The Tramp is a young, homeless woman who is referred to as \"The Gamin\" and is played by Chaplin's then-wife, Paulette Goddard. These two are brought together by the fact they have almost nothing except the will to live and continue forward, despite adversity. Both are nameless, neither has a home, and they each have no money or material possessions.It is here that Chaplin makes his most poignant and saddening statement about modern living. The Tramp and The Gamin are the only characters who exhibit individuality and idealism, yet they are also the ones lowest on the social and economic food chain. The conclusion of the film, which most likely reflects upon Chaplin's own emotions, is tinged with sadness, but also a lingering hopefulness that resonates as loudly and clearly today as it did more than sixty years ago.Then there is, of course, the comedy, which is the stuff of legendary status. Some of the most memorable comic images in film history are found in Modern Times. These include The Tramp's bout with an assembly line (and his resulting twitches), his unfortunate encounter with \"nose-powder\", the moment when he quite literally becomes a cog in the wheels of industry, and his epic struggle to bring roast duck to an angry customer.In my opinion, however, the two standout moments are the scene in a department store involving a blindfold and some rollerskates (the most exquisite moment of comedy in the film) and the sequence where The Tramp is submitted to the mad whim of an out-of-control feeding machine (the most uproarious moment in the film).These are just a handful of moments that make Modern Times the enduring masterpiece that it is. On a personal level, the aspect of the film that resonates strongest with me is its appeal to the idealistic misfit in all of us. In our hearts, many of us long for the simplicity and exuberance with which The Tramp and The Gamin live life (with attention to the bare essentials and an absence of need for materialism and modern trappings).As Chaplin so skillfully shows, however, our modern times make this lifestyle a faded dream, lost among the sheep-like herds of men and women scurrying through a modern metropolis that only Fritz Lang could make seem darker and more devoid of true humanity. Still, the final image of Modern Times refuses to let the film end on an exclusively tragic note and demonstrates that the individual is still alive and may yet find his way in an ever-changing world.",

Later, moreover, Chaplin will be heavily attacked by the government on charges of being a communist sympathizer.I liked the film, and its story full of hope and good humor, but also full of sharp criticisms of the labor system, unbridled capitalism and the lack of social support for those in need. Chaplin is excellent, but Paulette Goddard is not. In addition to looking old for the role, she doesn't fit well with Chaplin. But he easily overcomes that and completely dominates the film, to the point of overshadowing the actress and everything else with her antics and acrobatics.Technically, the film is very well done and very elegant. It is probably one of the last classic silent films, since when it came out the spoken cinema was about ten years old and silent cinema was clearly doomed to disappear.",

But did this world really change a lot when nowadays we walk to the subway (or we drive in crowded streets) like cattle in order to reach our working place? In fact, what Charlie Chaplin and the beautiful Paulette Goddard (a close up of her face after The Little Tramp is arrested for the theft of a loaf of bread is magnificent) really wants from modern times is a small, decent house where to have dinner together, an apple to grab by stretching your arm outside the window and fresh milk from a cow. Charlie Chaplin doesn't need to speak on the screen (while talking pictures were already widely produced since late 20's) to deliver his brilliant view on 1936's world; and even when he does talk during the floor show towards the end of the movie, we don't need to understand what it is said to appreciate once more his talent and genius. There are two moments that stand out during the movie: the feeding machine that feeds The Little Tramp on the assembly line in the first part of Modern Times (note also some similarities later when the mechanic assistant feeds his boss). And the splendid final scene when before fading out, The Little Tramp invites The Gamin to smile while walking on an empty street at dawn; a scene that alone is worth a full movie, a smile that becomes the essence of the use of trying. This last moment is full of hope and full of humanity; things that we still struggle for in our modern times.",

            "content": "Everywhere people look, there is someone staring at a machine. Computers have become more popular than they were ten years ago. Gameboys and iPods are constantly used by young people the world over. Even \"mom and pop\" stores rely on machines. Who predicted that all this was going to happen? One person did in 1936 and his name was Charles Chaplin. The world's greatest director said all this in his best film Modern Times. Obviously predicting the future wasn't Chaplin's only intention. He also wanted to take his beloved Tramp character to bigger and more exciting settings. The gags are important for all of Chaplin's comedic pictures and Modern Times is no exception. Finally, the Tramp was given a real love interest and one who the viewers want Chaplin to get together with. Modern Times stands as not only one of the funniest, but also one of the most important movies of all-time.One of the most famous images from Modern Times is one showing the Tramp in the middle of a group of cogs. What most people don't know is what occurs after, which involves the Tramp becoming crazy and being sent to a mental asylum. This represents something that was happening to factory workers at the time. Chaplin understood the workers' problems and was able to show what was happening to them on screen in a comedic, but respective manner. However, the main reason that Modern Times has become timeless is because it is still relevant in today's society. Technology can be found everywhere nowadays, so much so that people are now obsessed with getting the newest game system or portable video device. Chaplin feared that that would happen and he used his film to show the future decay of society. About a decade before the publication of George Orwell's 1984, Modern Times featured a factory president barking orders and spying at everyone using a television. What is even more impressive is that the television did not enter the world until the 1950's. Now, while Modern Times is a silent film, people are heard speaking, but only from electronic devices showing Chaplin's opinion on the \"talkie\" revolution. However, since this would be the Little Tramp's final appearance, it was time to give more space for more gags.Charlie Chaplin's short films concerned mostly simple gags repeated throughout its short course. When he made the large leap to feature-length films, he allowed the Tramp character to grow far from what he considered a comedy to be. He had said to Mack Sennett while leaving Keystone Films that all you need to make a comedy is \"a policeman, a park and a pretty girl.\" Yes, Modern Times does have various policemen as well as a pretty girl, but it has moved far beyond the park. Chaplin's wonderful idea to lampoon Henry Ford's assembly line involved him moving the Tramp from the park into the factory. He also renamed him the \"factory worker.\" People are so enthralled by the factory worker's actions due to how well constructed the story is. Chaplin's screenplay is so entertaining and thrilling. This is a story that makes one think and laugh at the same time. Only the Tramp could go through each job and fail miserably, but already be ready for a new adventure involving a new girl.In Chaplin's previous works, the Tramp is mostly seen going after a girl and trying to win her heart. However, there is always an obstacle in the way, whether it be a big bully also fighting for her affection or blindness. In the end, he never does get the girl and walks off into the sunset. For Modern Times, the Tramp and the gamin are a team ready for new adventures. With Chaplin not trying to get together with her, it actually works out better for him. Paulette Goddard's performance is very nuanced and she is a girl the audience likes and was probably the smartest female character in Chaplin's film. The Tramp and the gamin's combined knowledge of hard-knocked life make them fight the oppression of the world. Even when they're down on their luck near the end of the film, the Tramp gives this important piece of information: \"Buck up - Never say die. We'll get along!\" The Tramp was always not only raising the viewer's spirits, but the characters in his films as well. The gamin was the last character he'd give his advice to and it was probably his best. Anyone down on their luck should have a positive outlook on life, because it won't get better if someone mopes all day long. For those with negative minds will lead a horrible and unhappy life. These are the ideas that people should carry with them everyday.While one of Charlie Chaplin's main intention was to make people laugh, he also wanted to educate viewers about the problems facing people in America. Modern Times is a masterpiece where the Tramp fights depression, gets the girl and makes people have a jolly good time.",

Directed, written by, and starring Charlie Chaplin. The film boldly made statements that at the time would have been, very controversial, and remain relevant today. However, the film is at its most impressive when one considers the care, and shear brilliance that went into the making of this film.It seems straightforward to call Modern Times a Formalist Film, the ideas take clear precedence, while the narrative is very character driven. To further that, it would seem the main purpose of this film is to make a statement, technology and the business like approach of filmmaking are ruining the art form, however it's ingeniously hidden behind hilarious humor. The fact that the statement is so well hidden makes it all the more powerful when you realize what it is. For instance people who staunchly disagree with that opinion could laugh at, and enjoy this film without even knowing the film is making this statement.The motifs are ones that don't age poorly as some may. Chaplin chose such vague areas, that we can watch today and relate many arguments to modern day film issues. For instance the technology argument is still present today in the form of \"Digital Filming v. Film Reels\", or \"Computer Generated Images v. Practical Effects.\", etc., both modern arguments hold similar issues with the \"Talkie v. Silent\" argument of the 1930's. Chaplin consistently shows motifs such as the outcast being exiled for a more uniform approach (the black sheep imagery helps parallel this), the overly complicated, often dysfunctional way Chaplin sees technology , or his pessimism towards society, through a showing of eternal optimism. It's similar to when a filmmaker makes you empathize with a character you've grown to hate. All of these motifs are subtly hidden under hilarious gags, so they don't feel preachy, or heavy handed. This approach requires care, and talent, some of the best directors today can't even send a message as subtly as Chaplin did. Part of the reason Chaplin did so well hiding his views was his ability to, for the most part argue his point objectively. By that time colors were being used to influence audience opinions, red made audiences feel uncomfortable, while blue emphasized happiness, Chaplin avoided any colors. Not only did Chaplin avoid coloring his film, he showed the contrasting views, something most filmmakers wouldn't do. It's the brilliant subtlety, and balance that makes Modern Times such a great piece of art. Chaplin carefully crafted a film with a message, but made his film enjoyable for all, which is a true accomplishment. It's truly amazing to see a film that can send a message through the opposite viewpoint, and I can't stress how truly brilliant it is.",

I mean, after all, he was filthy rich yet he played a poor and broke man and yet audiences around the world supported the actor (even through some troubled headlines). It's easy to see why because his character is pretty much the working man that you can find everywhere and then there are the dreams that this simple man has.Of course, people connect with the dreams of the Tramp character but they also love the laughs that he brings and there's no doubt that there are plenty here. There are several great sequences here but of course the highlight has to be the feeding machine inside the factory. This entire sequence is one great laugh after another but then you've got the \"nose powder\" scene in jail as well as the now famous skating sequence. On top of that, movie fans were finally given their chance of hearing Chaplin speak and boy what a scene that is!What's really amazing about MODERN TIMES is the fact that Chaplin pretty much stuck to his guns by not including a lot of dialogue. This here is basically a silent film with the exception of a few scenes and there's no question that it works perfectly as one. I mean, can you really imagine spoken words in this thing?

The cute romance, the great laughs and the heart strings are certainly pulled by both here.MODERN TIMES is certainly one of the greatest films ever made.

After their lives cross paths, they try to help each other through the hard times.It all may sound pretty grim from that description, but it wouldn't be a Charlie Chaplin movie without some humor: he gets cranked through a machine in the factory, he gets mistaken for a march leader when trying to give a truck back its flag, and he accidentally swallows \"nose powder\", to name a few. It's probably his second best movie behind \"The Great Dictator\".",

Maybe working a somewhat tedious job and having to survive by myself out in the world makes it more relatable, emotional, and cathartic.I also think having seen a few more silent films since 2011 helps (yes I know this isn't 100% silent, but it's close). Chaplin was one of the first silent filmmakers I watched, and maybe I therefore took for granted just how good he was at the craft. His performance is great, the scenarios he crafts are great, and it's even really well shot to boot.While the aforementioned City Lights may have a more coherent and emotional story, Modern Times has the set pieces, and surely features the highest number of memorable stand-alone sequences of any Chaplin movie.It's wrapped up with a somewhat sudden but still very touching final scene that I think must have been intended to give the Depression-era audience hope in their own lives. On that note, I genuinely believe this is both one of the best movies about the Great Depression, and one of the best movies made during the Great Depression.Essential Chaplin, essential viewing, and essentially almost perfect.Definitely a must-watch.",

            "content": "'Modern Times' was Chaplin's last silent (not really a 'silent' as such-more on that later)containing the Little Tramp's last film outing. It is a brilliant piece of satirical comedy that ranks right up there with the all-time greats. Chaplin's artistry as a film-maker, intelligence and social awareness was never conveyed so perfectly as it is here.Chaplin's tramp was always an outcast- yet here it is perhaps most obvious and poignant, as 'The Little Tramp' is an outcast fighting the overwhelming force of the Industrial Revolution. 'Modern Times' is brilliant in it's social commentary and nuances. For proof, just look at some of the subtle images used by Chaplin. The opening credits roll, with a a mob of white sheep flowing endlessly towards the bottom of the screen- and a black sheep is seen. Yes, symbolism at it's most obvious yet it's most subtle. Many people I know watch that shot and don't pick up on the importance- yet it is brilliant. Scenes and timeless images of Charlie being bamboozled and flummoxed by machinery serve as reminders of the loss of personality and the individual due to mechanization and capital gain.It isn't really a silent at all- yet it still is. We don't hear normal conversation, but commands given over machines, radio's blaring and the amazing and haunting factory big-screen that must have transfixed and inspired George Orwell somewhat in his novel 'Nineteen Eighty-four'. Sound effects are used for comic effect, and Chaplin's own voice is finally revealed in a nonsense song of gibberish. There is sound, and the Little Tramp does emit noise, yet the mystery and allure of silent film-making still remains.Chaplin's real-life love at the time was his 'Modern Times' leading lady Paulette Goddard, and she plays a feisty, determined 'Gamin' here. Chaplin's infatuation with Goddard is obvious- her character is given a lot more screen time than other Chaplin women. She photographs beautifully here, and her gutsiness is sexually inviting- look at the frank, uninhibited way she attacks that banana! You'll fall in love with her immediately- just one look at that gorgeous grin and I was hooked. Goddard adds warmth and a touching sensitivity to her performance, and she is wonderful in the role- The Little Tramp has found his soul-mate and equal in her, she's every bit the outcast he is. One can imagine the odd little pair marrying and producing a child like Jackie Coogan's 'Kid'.Chaplin's genius can only be done justice in full-length essays, so I'll have to keep it brief and somewhat convoluted here. A few short notes to finish off the piece: -Chaplin's essential theme of survival at all costs is brilliantly (I think I've used that word a hundred times already, but I'll use it again) displayed through the food motif, and the charming and extremely original sequence where the tramp imagines a perfect home for him and his girl. The American Dream of milk and honey, indeed.-Chaplin's mastery of physical comedy in his astonishingly graceful skating and excellent gags involving cigars.Amazing, timeless score.Extremely funny takes involving Chaplin being jailed for picking up a red flag (a suspected Communist agitator) and his encounter with 'nose-powder' at the jail are sly social references.-Beautiful ending. Just beautiful. Inspiring, very sentimental- only Chaplin could get away with this brand of sentimentality. Lovely.I can't use enough superlatives to describe this. Just watch and enjoy.10/10.",

            "content": "On a technical and storytelling level, Chaplin made better movies than MODERN TIMES. The film is quite episodic even by Chaplin's standards and loses a little steam in some parts. However, this one might be the most socially relevant of his work. In fact, it transcends its Depression-era context: we of the twenty-first century know even more keenly than audiences of the 1930s how far technology has come and how dehumanizing its effects can be. Things like the feeding machine are not just satirical gags-- they feel like something Amazon or any other huge corporation might use in favor of saving a buck. The Little Tramp, always the outsider, was never more alienated than here, where the other characters often move like automatons or, as in the first allegorical shot, herded sheep, all of them sleepwalking through life and forced into repetitive, grueling work with little hope of a better life. The Tramp's sole kindred spirit is the Gamine, played with such a youthful vivacity by Paulette Goddard that you completely forget she's too old for the role. The film's original ending called for the Tramp and the Gamine's ultimate separation. She becomes a nun (presumably to escape the life of a wanderer) and he takes to the road, walking into the sunset alone while the Gamine dreams of joining him once more. In my opinion, the more optimistic ending with the Tramp and the Gamine walking off into the future together is more fitting to Chaplin's humanist vision: life is hard but we still have one another and the ability to try to face it all with a smile.",

The distinction may be subtle, but 'Modern Times' is not so much a silent film as it is a sound film without sound, and Chaplin's tramp is all too clearly an anachronism among the humming dynamos and labor unrest of the 1930s (he might have called the film 'Changing Times'). Enough echoes of the old days remain to qualify it as a classic (including the mad dance through the factory and another great roller skating routine), but after his earlier 'City Lights' his sense of humor would never again measure up to his social conscience, and the hope with which the Little Tramp faces the future at the end of the film is not nearly so clear as Chaplin's regret at leaving silent film behind.",

            "review_title": "Farewell to the Tramp",
            "content": "At a time when the art of filmmaking was rapidly churning toward the future, Chaplin was still fighting a one-man battle in favor of silent films. Famously he didn't think much of talking pictures and predicted that they would die out in five years. So, he gleefully pressed on, working his magic in, what was perceived, as a dead art form. Chaplin's contemporaries thought he was behind the times and he continued to fight a battle by keeping his films silent even though he didn't make many in the sound era. As punishment, his last two silent films, City Lights and Modern Times, did not receive one single nomination.Neither of the two silent films that he made after The Jazz Singer were totally silent, they incorporated sound effects and a line or two of dialogue, but both used sound as a means of being critical of the process. First was City Lights which opened with a political speech in which the audience only heard squawks coming from the speaker's mouths. The other was Modern Times, a red-blooded assault on madness of the machine age.Modern Times wasn't his best film but it was certainly better than anything else released in 1936. It was one of his most important films mainly because it was his transition from silent to sound. Here he satirizes the process but there is a tone that suggests that he's ready to move on. It is the most technologically innovative of his works yet it remains silent. The only noises come from machines and the only voices are heard over a radio, a monitor and a phonograph. The message is that Chaplin will move into the sound age, but that doesn't mean he will give it any respect. The reason that the film is important is because it displays his best gifts for satire. His other films had satire but it bubbled under the surface \u2013 this film is more of a full-frontal assault. He exposes the madness of over-dependence on machines, the economic crisis, communist paranoia and man's never-ending pursuit food, glorious food.Most importantly, perhaps most famously, this is the film in which Chaplin bids farewell to The Tramp. There was some discussion of the possibility of giving the Tramp a speaking voice but Chaplin wouldn't hear of it. When the studio insisted on it, he created a moment in which the Tramp sings a song, an odd tune called \"Titania,\" sung in gibberish.Five years after City Lights, Chaplin uses The Tramp to show how the society has changed, how it has grown past his gentle nature and threatens to crush his fragile spirit. In the blistering maelstrom of The Great Depression (this was 1936) we find that The Tramp has had to join the work force, working ten hour days at a steel factory turning the bolts on a grotesque machine that frequently breaks down and constantly speeds up. As he turns the bolts on the conveyor belt, he has to catch up if he misses one. The machine finally swallows him, and The Tramp finds himself bending inside the machine's cogs, but he's so loopy that he doesn't even notice.Although the film finds The Tramp working it also underpins the same theme that Chaplin has always worked with, survival. After going insane, The Tramp is sent to a mental institution and after having been cured, the rest of the film chronicles his desperate search for work. At the docks he meets a gamine (Paulette Goddard), a plucky girl stealing bananas for her brothers and sisters. Food becomes a dominating goal for these two and one of the central themes of the picture: The gamin steals bananas and later bread; The Tramp is nearly killed by an automatic feeding machine that short circuits; The couple have cake in a department store where he works as the night watchman; He eats a very large meal that he can't pay for in order to get thrown in jail where he will have decent food and a roof over his head; Later when he gets his job back at the factory he stops to have lunch even though his supervisor is stuck inside the machine; And he fantasizes about his dream house and coming home to the wife . . . at dinnertime.The world of Modern Times is not that far removed from Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Both films present a world besieged by the chaos of its own technology and both present the kinds of oppression that Orwell would brought to \"1984\". The inside world is a crush of machines and noise, the outside world is awash in riots, strikes and marches. The Tramp, as always finds himself caught in the middle of one damn thing after another. The message is that things are tough all over, but as The Tramp confides in the gamin to keep chin up and spirits high because if you keep trying eventually, it will all work out.Most of the Tramp's efforts come to nothing, just when he has something it blows away in the wind and he finds that he has to start all over again. This has been the theme of the Tramp all along and, given his determination, we know that he will never give up.It's fitting that Chaplin's Tramp bows out in Modern Times, one more film and I think he would have become dated. The world has moved past him, it's grown too large and too fast for his gentle spirit to maintain. In the end we find him still searching for his dream, the difference is that in the end when he walks into the sunrise of a new day he doesn't go alone. With that, we know he'll be okay.**** (of four)",

            "content": "1936's Modern Times is my first look at Charlie Chaplin. Despite everyone raving about his work, I never felt particularly attracted to his films because silent films were never my jam. Lucky for ever-changing tastes! This particular film is often considered one of Chaplin's best so why not use this film to enter his filmography. I loved this film! During it's breezy 1 hour and 27-minute length, I was enthralled with what this legend brought to the screen. This film, which was seen as far-sighted when initially released, is a politically relevant film even here in the 21st century. The film is also beautiful, romantic, hilarious, well-acted, well-directed, and just a wonderful film in general.The film was released in 1936, when talky films were in full force. Chaplin's main appeal was silence and his famed character \"The Tramp\" was based on actions, not words. He felt sound would alienate many of his fans, which is why he retired the character after this film. He did incorporate sound and a romantic score into his movie. For the first ever, Chaplin's voice can also be heard as his character sings a gibberish (perhaps, Italian?) song. His later works would be full dialogue, but none would hit the soaring heights of his silent films or so am I led to believe.Chaplin has always been a political guy, but he generally kept politics away from his films. Not this time. After touring Europe and seeing the ravaging effects of the Great Depression, he felt depressed by what he saw. He also had a discussion with Gandhi about the advent of technology. While Chaplin may not have agreed with everything Gandhi said, he did say he saw exactly what he meant. Essentially, this is a movie about trying to keep our humanity in world with technology that gets better and better. Technology that is used for profit. This theme is why this film is hits hard in today's extremely modern world.Chaplin returns to play \"The Tramp\" one more time here. I don't know if there is much of a plot as this film plays out like a series of sketches. The first part is Chaplin on an assembly line trying to keep up with the line. Then, Chaplin is chosen to try out a new automatic feeding machine. That is followed by Chaplin being accused of being mentally ill and being a communist. He also falls in love with a beautiful, homeless orphan played by the stunning Paulette Goddard.The film is all about Chaplin, and Goddard to an extent. This is my first time seeing him in action, and I instantly understood why everyone loved this guy. He does not need to use words to be funny. His slapstick is excellent, and it worked very well with the political themes. My favorite scenes are the assembly line and the singing scenes. The dude pays excellent attention to even the smallest details. The eyebrows, the hand movements, just everything is part of the act. Goddard is a lovely pick by Chaplin and she just has to be about the most beautiful orphan ever seen on film!Chaplin is associated with just about everything when it comes to producing his films. He directs them, stars in them, and even composes the music. This film is almost perfection when it comes to those aspects of this film. The music, which he originally composed with Alfred Newman, is one of the best scores out there. The score is one of those scores that would reduce you to tears every time you listen to it. It also works very well with the film.I cannot recommend Modern Times enough. It's a sharp, relevant film that is absolutely hilarious at times. For a film that came out when silent films were no longer popular, Chaplin had his work cut out for him. The result was one of the greatest films that he ever made, and apparently he made lots of them! I am definitely excited to see more of his works, especially those involving \"The Tramp.\" What a beautiful movie!My Grade: A",

As all baseball historians know Phil Wrigley was the last of club owners to put lights in his ballpark and the Chicago Cubs did not have lights on Wrigley Field and play night games until after his death. So to Chaplin was the last silent screen artist and Modern Times was his triumph in that art form. People actually did see it in 1936 and this was now an audience that was used to dialog from the mouths of movie performers.Modern Times has Chaplin and his little tramp character go after the effects of industrialization and how factory work robs the soul of its individuality and sense of accomplishment. The smarter bosses recognized this and provided workers with incentives and activities that ameliorated this feeling. Too many were like Chaplin's bosses who only thought of increased production.One of the great moments in the film comes when the manager selects Charlie as a test guinea pig for a feeding machine feeling that too much production time was lost while employees had their lunch. Charlie in that machine being force fed was hysterical. The gag was so good that Crosby and Hope used it for a double effect in The Road To Hong Kong.After losing many jobs and spending time in jail when he's picked up for union organizing, Charlie among other things gets a job as a singing waiter. Here Chaplin treads ever so gently into dialog when after losing the lyrics he sings a gibberish type ballad, similar to the Klopstokian language in Million Dollar Legs. Another treasured moment from Modern Times.Modern Times also introduced Paulette Goddard to the big screen and she and Chaplin were involved and got married. In his memoirs Chaplin ironically recounted that while she got many offers after the film was over he because he still would not consider a sound film just stayed at home until 1940 and The Great Dictator. He also said that costuming was difficult. It's easy enough to make a good looking girl enhance her beauty with the best of fashion. But Paulette Goddard who played a poor waif in the film had to look beautiful in rags. Chaplin recounts he spent a lot of time trying to get the right effect for Goddard.Among the many of Charlie's talents was that of composer. His famous ballad Smiles is heard throughout the film at poignant moments. Naturally only as an instrumental. I commend Nat King Cole's recording of the song.Speaking of poignant moments the uncertain future that Charlie and Paulette have at the end of Modern Times cannot be described. Charlie the tramp and Paulette the waif just looking for a spot on earth where they can be themselves. Isn't that something we all want.Though it has little spoken words and none from its leads Modern Times lived up to its billing in that it came out at a time when organized labor was given the right to finally organize and it was struggling to assert that right during the New Deal. A lot of the lessons of Modern Times on that subject need to be revisited. And often.",

The movie is a great satire on the post-Depression period in the United States' history when a little Tramp having had a nervous breakdown at the factory he was working at (greatest opening sequence ever and the most hilarious scene of all is when a self-feeding machine beats the Tramp with a mouth-wiper), went to jail and after being released from it had to go through hell to get a job and make a living.But Tramp quickly loses interest in trying to get a job as he is no good at anything and he wants to return to jail, the only place where he was happy and didn't need to worry about the future. That's when he meets a girl who is as lost as he is and together they must find a way, an open road for the two of them, to survive in this rapidly changing modern world.Chaplin always spoke loudly about poverty and people living from day to day without hope but this time he also touched upon changes that came with the Great Depression into the country: incapability of rehabilitation for ex-convicts and ordinary people in order to get a job, manpower for machinery substitution and even the drug trafficking. Charles himself changed a lot: he wasn't a young man anymore, he had become bitter about life and the times that were a-changing so fast and he felt the urge to speak his mind about it in his own manner, the one that anyone can understand, relate to and sympathize with; but no matter how difficult the modern times are we should never forget how to smile and keep going forward.",

He plays one of the hordes who slave away for low wages while the upper classes while away in their idleness.Charlie is at his best here and the film contains many memorable scenes, including his being caught in the giant machinery of a factory, his inadvertent leading of a protest march which lands him in jail, his blindfolded excursion on roller skates, his delightful song in the cafe and the memorable final scene as he saunters arm-in-arm down the road and into the sunset with his wonderful costar, Paulette Goddard, as the picture fades out.

            "content": "\"Modern Times\" would be Chaplin's last silent film stand against the encroachment of talking pictures, which in actuality were almost a decade under way by 1936. It also takes dead aim at the advance of a mechanized age, a modernizing society dependent on speed and efficiency at the expense of humanity. Fritz Lang's austere 1927 film \"Metropolis\" took a similar approach but with a much darker tone, daring to ask 'Who are the slaves of the machines\"? For Chaplin, opposition to that slavery is on display in his comedic, almost manic depiction of factory life and the assembly line. One can't help but notice the influence Chaplin had on later film makers; I immediately drew a comparison to Lucille Ball's hilarious attempt to keep pace at the candy factory, blending elements of Chaplin's frantic pace on the assembly line with the dehumanizing aspect of the Bellows Feeding Machine.A startling aspect of the story line for me was the introduction of the communist element when The Tramp is arrested for accidentally leading a workers' revolt. One doesn't immediately connect the term 'communist' to it's Bolshevik roots dating back to 1917, but it was obviously on Chaplin's mind two decades later.Knowing that he did his own stunts, it was truly amazing to see Chaplin's dexterity on a pair of roller skates. The blindfold scene on the fourth floor toy shop was incredible, and made me wonder what precautions were taken to prevent serious injury in case all didn't go well. Obviously, the man had talents that went well beyond making films.I mentioned that scene from an 'I Love Lucy' episode earlier, but there's another observation I'd like to offer that might have influenced the opening to a popular TV show of the Sixties. In his domestic daydream involving The Gamin (Paulette Goddard), The Tramp is shown walking away from the camera and tripping over an ottoman as he approaches Goddard. One could surmise that Dick Van Dyke took inspiration for his own pratfall gimmick from the master Chaplin some quarter century later. Chaplin's genius would find his ideas being repeatedly recycled under the slogan 'everything old is new again'.",

The little man\u2014it scarcely needs be said\u2014is Charlie Chaplin, whose \"Modern Times,\" opening at the Rivoli, restores him to a following that has waited patiently, burning incense in his temple of comedy, during the long years since his last picture was produced.That was five years ago almost to the day. \"City Lights\" was its name and in it Mr. Chaplin refused to talk. He still refuses. But in \"Modern Times\" he has raised the ban against dialogue for other members of the cast, raised it, but not completely. A few sentences here and there, excused because they come by television, phonograph, the radio. And once\u2014just once\u2014Mr. Chaplin permits himself to be heard.Those are the answers to the practical questions. They do not tell of Mr. Chaplin's picture, or of Chaplin himself, or of the comic feast that he has been preparing for almost two years in the guarded cloister in Hollywood known as the Chaplin studio.But there is no cause for alarm and no reason to delay the verdict further: \"Modern Times\" has still the same old Charlie, the lovable little fellow whose hands and feet eyebrows can beat an irresistible tattoo upon an audience's or hold it still, taut beneath the spell of human tragedy. A flick of his cane, a quirk of a brow, an impish lift of his toe and the mood is off; a droop of his mouth, a sag of his shoulder, a quick blink of his eye and you are his again, a companion in suffering. Or do you have to be reminded that Chaplin is a master of pantomime? Time has not changed his genius.",

I do not know how to find a flaw in this movie or in anything I have ever seen that was acted and/or made by Charles 'Charlie' Chaplin. Thus I cannot give it anything but a 10 out of 10. There is a consensus about numbers in reviews being abstract and arbitrary and not being necessarily able to back up the words, feelings and emotions of the review as it might be too mathematical, and in turn, ironically, way too inaccurate. Luckily, a 100% percent in math and in encompassing every other thing means just one thing - Perfection.I have recently started watching a continuous series of Chaplin material which do include his best works, agreed upon by a general consensus. I will try to write reviews but they won't inform you too much beyond how much I enjoyed those movies and how essential it is for you to include those memories in your life, possibly ;p.As far Modern Times is concerned, my opinion as is similarly reflected by rating that it may very well a timeless masterpiece. It immortalizes the story of the times of industrial progress and how it affected the various people, even though only two characters (It is enough considering their talent). Chaplin and Pauline Goddard don't utter a noise, as was necessitated by the genre of the film and the choice made by Chaplin, and yet tell a story so profound that it might bring tears to the corner of eyes in reaction to the clog in your throat as you subconsciously contemplate if this is just one of the greatest films in the comedy genre. Lastly, thanks to the people at United Artists and everybody who made the re-release possible. It shows the appreciation and love you felt to bring to every who couldn't witness it beforehand; it may or may not changer their lives but it will leave with a precious laughs and a better picture of what movies can be at their best.",

            "content": "First we need the definition of a 'gamin', the role that Paulette Goddard plays. (gamin, n : a homeless child who has been abandoned and roams the streets.)  Much of Chaplin's 'Modern Times' is a parody on modern manufacturing techniques -- assembly line and efficiency studies, the need to keep up with competition. That was 'modern' in 1936, and it is still modern today. It is interesting that years before commercial television came into use, this movie uses large TV-type screens for the factory boss, who works jigsaw puzzles in his office while workers slave, to monitor his workers, and for them to see him as he gives instructions. So what we have in this little movie is a commentary on working conditions, and a lot of typical Chaplin slapstick comedy. Looking at it fresh, I suspect that Rowan Atkinson got a lot of his inspiration for his Mr Bean character from watching Charlie Chaplin's 'Little Tramp.' Great old movie, but impossible to rate against all the fine movies made since then. Chaplin still preferred his movies 'silent', and most of it is. However, whenever there are announcements in the background, we hear them. When he dances, we hear the shoes slide along the floor. When he sings the improvised song, we actually hear his voice. The whole thing works very effectively.SPOILERS, for my own recollection, don't read any further. OK!? We first see him in a very fast-moving assembly line where is only task is to tighten two bolts as plates pass by. Later we see him on the moving belt, then sucked into the machinery, then he passes through the giant gear wheels. He loses this job, is unemployed, end up in jail and has it pretty good there. Several times, after he gets out, he tries to get back in, it is the best housing and food that he has had. When the girls' father dies her two young sisters are put into homes, but knowing her eventual fate she runs away, and is pursued by the authorities much of the second half of the movie. She and he meet, take to each other, and the movie ends with them walking together, away from the audience, down the middle of a rural two-lane road.",

            "content": "Could any other actor recycle the same character so many times and make it fresh and insightful each time? I think not. The Tramp (Chaplin) does what most people would really like to do to the assembly line that underpins modern industry that we love for its bounty and hate for its dehumanizing characteristics; he thumbs his nose at it. For that his character pays the price. And, yes, he pays the price for some of the usual perils of 1930s life -- its poverty and its desperation. He takes the blame for stealing a loaf of bread that a damsel in distress has stolen so that she could sate her hunger. Picking up a red flag that has fallen from a lumber truck, he becomes by accident a communist agitator who ends up in jail for what was then a serious crime. He keeps his humanity in a world that punishes assertions of humanity with hunger and humiliation.To put it simply, Charlie Chaplin masters, as no comedian since has, the art of saying as much with the fewest words; insteadhe expresses himself physical comedy that nobody since can imitate. He demonstrates as nobody else could the absurdity of the harsh realities of the assembly line that dwarfed persons in his time -- and that there was still some life to the esthetic of the silent movie. He offers double-barrel laughter: we laugh at the circumstances, but laugh with him, with a twinkle and a trace of a tear. Nobody else has succeeded at that since. Today we see more talking heads, more people resorting to body functions, more self-pity, and lots of four-letter words and blasphemy. Yet it is Chaplin who puts humanity into humor as few others before (Mark Twain? Will Rogers?) and few since could. We laugh with him, and laugh at the things at which he pokes fun.",

It may well have a scathing and critical view of an impersonal society, but that does not stop it from being a wonderful film. What I love most about Modern Times is that it is both hilarious and original, and decides to bring a serious message in and a great one it is too.Modern Times is great visually, the cinematography and editing are both excellent and I loved the machines too as well as the stunning ending shot. The sound is also astonishing, as is the direction. Modern Times isn't completely silent, as it does use some rather nonsensical dialogue, which is used very effectively in mocking the characters. The comedy is very well-handled, we laugh at the Tramp's antics and their consequences, but not only we sympathise with the Tramp but there is also a very poignant love story. And I love the music, actually mainly because of the poignant yet hopeful Smile it is my favourite soundtrack in a Charlie Chaplin movie. The performances are great, Paulette Goddard is wonderful to watch but once again it is Chaplin with his faultless comedic timing and physical humour that captivates most.Overall, wonderful, another one of Chaplin's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

I guess the same will happen now since \"Modern Times\" is the highest praised Chaplin film on IMDb.com and I'm giving it only a 7 out of 10. It's a very good film, a brave and interesting satire on the great depression in USA, but Chaplin's other films like \"City Lights\", \"The Gold Rush\" and \"The Great Dictator\" were in my opinion superior and much more enjoyable.\"Modern Times\" starts with a frame of a herd of sheep, then cutting right into a mob of nervous factory workers, pointing out how the capitalism and the industrialization are treating people like a bunch of slaves. Chaplin's Tramp is one of those workers who looses his sanity from non stop work and gets fired. He then meets a poor girl, lands in prison, gets bailed out for helping stop a jail break and starts finding new jobs, just to get fired again. The story doesn't flow as smooth as some other silent classics from the famous actor/director and is made out of little bits and events which aren't connected. Apparently Chaplin made this without any script, and it shows. Also, some of his Tramp's goofy jokes today seem a little outdated and childish.------------ Still, putting the flaws aside, this is a quality film with human message. In today's mechanical age it even seems somewhat visionary since the poor, jobless couple back then can easily be found even today on the streets. But not to say the film is without humor, like when the Tramp picks up a red flag on the street that fell from a truck and gets mixed up with a communist leader or when the feeding machine proves to be a real useless disaster, something the machine haters will love to hate.Grade: 7/10",

            "content": "Chaplin airs his left-wing sympathies in this polemic on the Depression and the rise of automation. At the start we see sheep herded into a run, and then workers emerging from a subway exit - industrial mechanisation is reducing humans to bestial anonymity.  The profit motive induces factory owners to treat their employees with callousness.  Not only are the workers coerced into repetitious, soulless tasks, but the boss even tries to automate their food consumption.  The lunch machine goes wrong, and Chaplin is pointing out that mechanisation is far from infallible, and what is more, utterly absurd when inflicted on human beings.  In the film, two men fall into the machine and are 'chewed' by the cogs, metaphorically having their individuality swallowed by the industrial behemoth.In 1927, \"The Jazz Singer\" had claimed to be the first 'talkie' by straddling the boundaries between silence and recorded sound.  When Jolson sings, it is a soundtrack of a prepared recording synched with the action, rather than a rendition of the 'live' studio performance.  In the nine years between that and \"Modern Times\", sound recording and reproduction made enormous technological leaps, but here is Chaplin using the Jolson format of a decade earlier.  Recorded set pieces such as the Tramp's song in the restaurant, or the wireless set, or the 'mechanical salesman' are inserted into a soundtrack of incidental music.Nine years after they were rendered obsolete, Chaplin made a silent movie.  \"Modern Times\" even has the old-fashioned caption cards of twenty years earlier: \"Her Little Sisters - Motherless!\"The real triumph of this movie is the musical score, composed (of course) by Chaplin.  It is like a ballet score in feel, with great melodic variety and expressive changes of texture.  It includes rhumba and waltz passages, as well as Chaplin's theme tune, \"Smile\".It's easy to lose count of how many times in the course of the film Chaplin gets thrown in the back of a van.  He has a nervous breakdown at work and is chucked into a 'mental hospital' vehicle.  Later, he gets the same treatment from the police for being a derelict and is slung in the van twice for leftist activities (a socialist demonstration and a labour strike).  Society sweeps up its 'problems' and hides them away. In prison, the authoritarian regime which underpins capitalism on the outside exerts a malign influence on the prisoners, who are forced to stand and march on the spot after their meals.  Being in prison is a mirror image of working in a factory.  The socialist march and the strike are both violently attacked by the police.  The Depression is causing righteous indignation among the lower classes: society is on the edge of open rebellion.  The headline on the Tramp's newspaper as he reads in his cell is \"Strikes And Riots\".  Thus Chaplin the socialist makes his points about the burgeoning power of the right.Paulette Goddard as \"the gamin\" is a delight.  She brings an air of freshness to the proceedings, and her expressive face conveys the emotions of each scene very effectively.  Whether a 40-something tramp should be taking up with a female juvenile would certainly trouble a modern audience, but perhaps the 1930's was a more innocent age.There are some good gags in the movie.  Chaplin does his acrobatic stuff, with the skates and the waiter's pratfalls, not spilling anything on the tray.  The scene in the dilapidated shack is rich in cleverly-worked jokes, and the heavy toolbox back in the factory is excellent.  The hunting for the shirt cuffs during the song is very amusing.  When Chaplin stops work at the sound of the lunch hooter, leaving his boss trapped in the machine, it is a reinforcing of the film's serious theme - that the rigidities of industrial life are distorting our human values.There are few criticisms to be levelled at this pleasant, well-paced comedy.  One subjective observation is the 'bee' joke, which Chaplin can't resist including.  I personally find it very irritating.  If the Tramp is released from custody after ten days, why does he walk to freedom through the door of the police station?  Surely he hasn't been held in police cells all that time?  The 'Italian' song is somewhat over-indulgent.  And if Paulette escaped from the detectives the previous night, wearing her stage costume, how come we see her the following dawn, on a lonely road, wearing a different get-up?These are minor carps.  \"Modern Times\" is a well-made film and Chaplin's tour-de-force.",

And Modern Times is definitely a masterpiece. For my surprise I didn't find the movie that funny, it's for a good part \"cute\", like, I can't be sad watching some scenes, but you not necessarily are laughing too. But, the topics it approaches are incredible important, and relevant even nowadays. If the whole \"captalism destruction\" back then was something, imagine how it is today. I love everything with Paulette Goddard in this movie, she delivers a such powerful performance, she is charming, funny, but also can provide a raw and brutal sadness, you just fell for her.Even though at some point they just forgot about her sisters fate, the themes her family's plot talks about are real, and make us think about our own lives, and how we're blessed to have what we have.And again, Chaplin is amazing, you can almost see his dedication to the role, and everything else surrounding the movie. The guy was a genius, and even thoug Silient Movie was in a way \"dying\" in 1936, he still made a 90% Silent Movie, with writting words and stuff, and it was great.In fact (didn't know that, I was reading the trivia section here on IMBd and saw this) this is the last American movie with that style, and, the last dialogue title card of the film, and in a certain way, the entire silent era, is from The Tramp, who says \"Buck up - never say die! We'll get along.\", coincidence? Anyways, the movie is just cinema history being written on screen. I've said that in other silent movies I've reviewed before, I really don't know for sure how am I supposed to grade a movie like this, if I had to say on issue that I had with the movie it would probably be that some comediac scenes seems \"too long\", as I said, I didn't find the movie that funny, so for those scenes were just trying to get more laughs from me, when they actually hadn't even got the first one. But anyways, it could probably be the \"common style\" of the time.To wrap up, Modern Times is an amazingly important movie, that has some prety serious and dense subjects, but is done in a subtle way with a cleaver and lightful approach.9,5/10",

MODERN TIMES introduces Chaplin's iconic screen alter-ego aka. little tramp as an assembly-line worker in the Depression era, the factory's pristine props hark back to Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS (1927), but less futuristic, more realistic in its scale of grasping capitalism under the efficiency- prioritizing doctrine whereas a proletariat like the tramp, has no means to secure an auspicious future and is inescapably subjected to the exploitation by the industrialized society, picked as a guinea pig for a novel lunch-feeding contrivance, constantly under the duress of the ever- accelerating assembly-line, after being engorged by it (a brilliant surreal light-touch), he is driven mad and wreaks havoc on the machine and is sent to hospital, subsequently, being mistaken as a Communist and thrown into the prison, where he accidentally becomes a hero by thwarting a jail- break attempt, but ironically because he is high on cocaine, which he mistakes for salt in his lunch. Yet, whenever he is given a new lease on life, reality will cunningly squash his effort although in some cases, he has only himself to blame for. There is a skewering political spin aiming at the modernized assembly line, the humongous machines, the callous industrialists and the oppressive authority, being buried underneath the surface of bang-up farces, which has been scarcely actualized in Chaplin's works before. The plot mainly consists of a string of superlative skits de rigueur, which is completely in Chaplin's elements, the tramp's free-flowing pantomime, delightful slapstick and ingeniously devised set pieces (although the stomach-churning duet crops up as a head-scratcher) are typically endearing to watch, what is more astonishing is how he can make tough stunts look incredibly effortless, in particular with sleight of hand, an arresting trompe l'oeil is accomplished when he roller-skates blindfold against a matted painting which puts viewers at the edge of their seats for his safety. The story also presents a fiery heroine, the gamin (Goddard), a recently orphaned girl who is anything but a damsel-in-distress, Goddard, although is not endowed with Chaplin's bent of physical comedy, is impeccably elemental in foregrounding the gamin's gallantry and loveliness, takes on a weighty counterpart against the tramp's unostentatious playfulness, together, they help each other out in the difficult times, share bitter-sweet moments. A self-encouraging coda might betray Chaplin's precaution that comedy has its built-in calling to look on the brighter side, by and large, MODERN TIME is a reverberating showcase of Chaplin's competence which further transcends its time and context.",

Henry Bergman is the cafe manager at the San Pedro waterfront cafe, and Chester Conklin is the mechanic caught in the machinery. Stanley Sandford is Chaplin's partner on the assembly line in the factory. Chaplin tells the story of a man who tries to succeed in these modern times. His opening title tells us \"Modern Times-a story of individual enterprise, of humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness.\" This sets the stage for a realistic yet hilarious film about a homeless man who has lost his job at a factory. He meets up with a gamin of the streets. He is convinced to help them get a nice home in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Along the way on the streets, he is put in jail. Then he foils a jailbreak. Then he is set free. Then he is put back in jail. Then he escapes and meets the gamin. Then he gets a job as the night watchman in a department store and is sent back to jail for helping in a robbery during the night. He then meets up with the gamin, who has found a shack on the waterfront for them to live in. Next, the tramp gets a job in a local factory, but only succeeds in creating some havoc. Afterward, he gets into a fight with a policeman and is jailed. Upon release, he finds the gamin working at the San Pedro waterfront cafe, where he gets a job as a singing waiter. He proves a success at singing an impromtu song and dance number, but then the authorities arrive. They have come for the gamin. She has run away from juvenile officers after the death of her father! Together, Charlie and the gamin make an escape.  The next morning, they decide to take life as it comes, and they set out down the open road, hand-in-hand.

The film is mostly silent - going against modern times in 1936 - though sound effects, music, radio announcements, that type of thing, can be heard throughout. The Tramp and the Gamin (Paulette Goddard) are always silent. Yet they convey anything anybody ever needed to know.Modern Times is about a little man who just doesn't seem to belong anywhere. In the beginning, he's working in a factory on an assembly line, and when an efficiency expert brings in a \"feeding machine\" that will require workers to take less time for lunch, our Tramp is chosen. The machine breaks down while still connected to Chaplin, making for a fabulous scene. In another scene, he becomes part of the machine as he goes through it.The Depression is on and jobs are hard to come by, especially when you keep getting into trouble, so the Tramp goes from job to job. Eventually he meets the homeless Gamin, who is quick on her feet, and the two attempt to survive the hard times together.A small but handsome man, Chaplin as the Tramp is still recognizable today with his funny walk and little mustache. The most astounding thing about Chaplin is the way he used his body. The most brilliant example of this is the roller skating scene, but there are so many others - Chaplin's flexibility and balletic grace made him the greatest comedian ever. When he fails as a waiter and is called upon to sing in a restaurant, his movements to the song are phenomenal.Goddard is young and beautiful as the Gamin and does a terrific job as a streetwise girl who can't help getting discouraged. But The Tramp won't let her - he knows that together, they can make it. As funny in parts as this movie is, we're reminded of how poverty victimizes people and how try as some might, some people just don't belong in these modern, practical times that don't allow time for some of the simpler pleasures.One scene that foreshadowed corporate America today - there is a large television screen where the boss can see everything that's going on, even in the bathrooms, where he yells at people to get back to work. I'm sure that, even if that isn't available in most, if any, companies, workers definitely feel they are being kept track of every minute, with the use of time sheets, security cards, sign-ins, computer monitoring and the like.A truly great film by a master.

Yet elements of optimism shine through the weary film-Chaplin and his gamin dream of a home of their own, with cows ready to be milked and steaks crackling on the stove. Though their reality-a depilated shack \"Is no Buckingham Palace\" the two are able to sustain themselves on the \"American Dream\" of a more secure, fruitful life.Several aspects of the film called to mind a 1984-type reality (Though 1984 was written in 1949, 13 years after the birth of Modern Times) including the large two way screen in the factory, allowing the owner to be \"Big Brother\" to the workers as well as the police brutality and Ford factory line of men and machine.The film ends appropriately; dusty and bruised from pursuit, hardship and hunger, Chapin and his orphan girl head of hopefully into the sunset, convinced of a better reality awaiting them on the sun's return; a hope shared by many in America's Modern Times",

            "content": "Along with Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS, Charlie Chaplin's MODERN TIMES ranks as one of the greatest (and earliest) examples of the sorry plight of the working poor. MODERN TIMES begins with a shot of a clock (a time clock?) before cutting to a shot of sheep being herded along (to their deaths?), followed immediately by a shot of a herd of workers pressed shoulder to shoulder in their haste to get to work. Not exactly subtle, but the point is made. When The Assembly Line Worker (Chaplin) is selected to test an automatic worker-feeding machine (which will allow the workers to continue working during lunch), the contraption proves impractical. Not long thereafter, The Worker has a nervous breakdown and ends up quite literally caught up in the gears of The Machine. He's extricated and hauled away to a hospital. (Which means that he has better health care coverage than I ever did...) No sooner has he been released from the hospital than he's mistaken for a labor leader (a \"communist\") and hauled off to jail. He does his time, then meets a homeless girl (\"the gamin\") and they fall kinda sorta in love. He vows: \"We'll get a home! Even if I have to work for it.\" And so it goes, from one f---ed up situation to the next. MODERN TIMES could very well be \"rethought\" for today's audiences, though I seriously doubt anyone could come close to what Chaplin wrought.",

I really enjoyed this and am actually pretty surprised at how much I liked my first REAL silent film (The Artist doesn't count, it was made in 2011 and was meant to pay homage). Chaplin was hilarious in this movie, and did a great job directing/writing. I gotta admit it was pretty mesmerizing watching all the people do s*** in the 30s, like bro that was almost 90 years ago. I think one of my few complaints would have to be that some of the scenes went on for too long. Like the part where Chaplin feeds that dude his lunch, I thought most of it was unneeded lol. It was a very heartwarming and fun experience nonetheless, and I highly recommend.",

            "content": "A TIMELESS story of industry, of individual enterprise - humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness. Perhaps the most timeless theme in any Charles Chaplin movie - a man's struggle inside the insanity of the modern world. Technology is technology, no matter how advanced and small. And novel technology, no matter how good it might look on the paper, doesn't usually work as it's supposed to (the magnificent scene with the automatic feeder). Already in that era, Chaplin compared the people rushing to work with the herd of sheep, a metaphor that is widely overused nowadays.'Modern Times' is a pure lighthearted comedy, with slight tragic undertones, but in this case, they are so brief that barely the audience has the time to shed a tear when another fantastic burst of humor wipes the drama out of our minds. Yet, this is not a simple comedy. Lighthearted, I said, yes, but the movie carries a heavy message.Chaplin performs some of his better-known stunts - rollerskating in the department store and swimming through the heavy machinery and of course the unforgettable singing scene at the end. I'm sure that people at that time were quite surprised by how good a singer Chaplin was. And how anyone can forget Paulette Goddard as a fiery-eyed Gamin. That performance is the epitome of a self-reliant strong woman who can handle any situation. Real badass woman.Chaplin has created a movie that offers us joy even nearly ninety years after its release. And with the final uplifting line from the movie I end this review - Buck up - never say die! We'll get along.",

And of unemployment (between a Great Depression and a World War)? Written by, directed by, produced by, edited by, music composed by, and starring Charlie Chaplin. A true genius.The factory is not just \"modern\" but futuristic in a sense, looking like 1950s and 1960s sci-fi films. There are monitors everywhere (shades of \"1984\") and gigantic switches and cranks, and robots doing uniquely humanlike things.Chaplin, a socialist sympathizer, was clearly attacking the capitalist system in this film, particularly the idea of the assembly line and how monotonous it is. The film even goes so far as to show ways a company could make men even more like machines -- feeding them in line so as not to need a lunch break.Hooray for the \"gamin\" (Paulette Goddard), the child of the waterfront who refuses to go hungry! (The film's use of \"gamin\" is interesting to me for two reasons: one, the word is male, with the female being a gamine; two, it is today a more or less dead word, with the current popular term being \"street urchin\".) And hooray for Chaplin's dancing, which was just about the highlight of the film.",

            "review_title": "Modern backward-looking classic",
            "content": "In which Chaplin demonstrates his mastery of his medium in instinctively reverting his would-be talkie debut to a mainly silent piece reliant on skilled writing, timing and direction in delivering an indictment of the \"modern times\" he was living in. It's a brave movie for much more than just flying in the face of the prevailing Hollywood \"The Silents are dead\" trend, in indicting the soulless dehumanisation of factory-working, imprisonment and on a deeper level the suppression of individualism in society, yet makes its point by making us laugh at all this and more in a succession of hilarious set- pieces reliant on the great man's genius for mime, slapstick and comic invention.Interestingly, the movie does employ some speech, but only from the detached, inhumane factory owner, in an almost eerie prediction of Orwell's \"Big Brother\" from 1984\" penned a full 12 years later. There're also background sound effects and the musical number near the end is given voice too. However Chaplin's little tramp central character and Paulette Goddard's \"the Gamin\" utter nary a word and indeed old- fashioned title cards are used to convey speech as well as scene-changes.There's little to criticise here other than an episodic feel to the narrative, like so many silent-sketches knitted together, bit when the quality of the sketches are so well-done, this can be forgiven. Even Chaplin's much-criticised over-sentimentality is reined in somewhat (and Goddard never does get reunited with her two younger siblings who are put under the care of the court) with an open-ended finishing fade of the two-against-the-world deciding to take the hard road back to fight for the conventional house-on-a-hill dream of most Americans, all the more so given the background of The Great Depression.Some of the scenes are sheer genius, including Charlie's depiction as a cog in the inner- workings of the industrial machinery, his guinea-pig forced participation in the automated feeding process experiment of a dotty inventor, his foiling of the prison jail-break, the hilarious protest-march, his French song and dance routine near the end and so much more. In fact the only comedic scene which missed its mark for me was the tummy-rumbling scene with the visiting senator's wife. I also liked the more adult humour he introduces to give the lie to his cuddly family image as his traumatised factory-worker looks to tweak the dress-buttons-as-nipples of a passing female's clothing.Chaplin's direction show him at home in combining old-time fixed-camera slap-stick with sight-gags using combinations of imaginative camera-shots. His body movements and facial expressions are wonderful throughout. Goddard is beautifully fresh-faced throughout and successfully acts \"older\", which thankfully lessens the \"cute\" factor, if not quite belying the old criticism of his penchant of employing too young an actress as his female lead.For me then, this movie shows Chaplin confronting the modernising of society (and Hollywood itself) with complete mastery and redoubtable courage, not to mention plenty of laughs too.",

            "review_title": "The Chaplin six pack",
            "content": "This is a brief review of Charlie Chaplin's last six feature films.A comical take on Lang's \"Metropolis\" (1927), Chaplin's \"Modern Times\" opens with the words \"a story of industry and individual enterprise, humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness!\", an ironic jab at the mantras of industrial capitalism. The film then finds Chaplin reprising his iconic role as \"the tamp\", a poverty-stricken but lovable outcast whose ill-fitting clothes epitomise, amongst other things, his inability to fit in.The film watches as the tramp struggles to survive in a depressed economy. Like \"Metropolis\", it satirises labour, management and dehumanising working conditions. Elsewhere life for the worker is seen to be precarious, alternatives to playing the game are but death or prison, giant clocks speak to the daily grid of blue-collar workers, bosses are shown to be obsessed with speed and production, the property class relies on police brutality and all-encompassing surveillance, and the workplace itself is painted as an absurdest torture chamber. The film ends with the tramp on a road, America's future uncertain.\"Modern Times\" made waves when it was released. It was banned in fascist Germany and Italy, then allies of the West, and scorned by those in power in the United States. It was also heavily praised in the Soviet Union and France, particularly by philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Maurice Merlau-Pony. The film's middle section, which featured Chaplin waving a red flag and unwittingly leading communists and worker unions, would get Chaplin on several government watch-lists.Chaplin followed \"Times\" with \"The Great Dictator\". Hollywood studios wanted the film scuttled, so Chaplin financed it himself. It contains two criss-crossing plots, one about a Jewish barber who is essentially persecuted by Nazis, the other about a brutal dictator, a stand in for Adolf Hitler. Funny, scary and sad, the film would rock the US establishment. Hitler was, at the time, a US ally and good for business. What's more, he was viewed by those in power as a tool to destroy communist Russia. For many, Chaplin was a \"subverisive\" who was \"inciting war with an ally\". Deemed particularly offencive was a last act speech in which Chaplin urges the people of the world to \"love one another\", \"throw away international barriers\" and foster an \"international brotherhood\". Though deliberately vague, this speech was viewed as inflammatory. Was Chaplin extolling the virtues of the United States or the Soviet Union? Regardless, the US' approach to the conflicts in Europe promptly shifted. It became an ally with Russia, Hitler became the enemy and Germany attacked Russia. In the blink of an eye, \"Dictator\" went from being sacrilege to prophetic.Chaplin, British, was born into extreme poverty and often found himself sleeping on the streets of London. As such, he identified with his \"tramp\" character completely, as did millions word-wide, who saw themselves in the tramp: desolate, poor and forever bumbling down life's highways. Prior to shooting \"Times\", Chaplin would embark on a tour of the world, intent on seeing the effects of poverty. He'd talk to many prominent figures, most notably Churchill, George Bernard Shaw, Einstein and Gandhi.As Chaplin grew in consciousness, so would FBI files on Chaplin. He was put under government surveillance and forced to appear before a Senate subcommittee in 1941 where he was accused of being \"anti American\" and an \"unofficial communist\". Many newspapers, including the Times, began a campaign attacking Chaplin, and called for his deportation. In the mid 1940s he was charged with the Mann Act and the FBI would collude with newspapers to smear Chaplin as a sex maniac who \"perverted American culture\". From here on, conservative political pressure groups would attack each new Chaplin release. Some of his films would be boycotted or outright banned. In 1947 he'd be brought before the HUAC committee.Chaplin followed \"Dictator\" up with \"Monsieur Verdoux\". A black comedy, the idea for which came from Orson Welles, the films stars Chaplin as a bank clerk who loses his job and so murders women for cash and land. The film's point is explicit: if war is an extension of diplomacy, then murder is the logical extension of business. And so banking terminology is used to rationalise murder, weapons manufactures are idolised and the poor are condemned for trying to play by the rules of the wealthy. \"Numbers sanctify!\" Chaplain says, pointing to Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the ruthlessness of post-war capitalism; kill millions and you're a hero.Next came \"Limelight\", Chaplin's ode to silent film. Elegiac and autobiographical, the film stars Chaplin and the legendary Buster Keaton as two fading comedians. A meditation on time's passing, the film's also relentlessly optimistic; man must assert his will, his desires, no matter how glum the times! The film would be banned from several US theatres. Chaplin himself was swiftly banned from entering the US and several of his assets were seized. He'd live in Switzerland henceforth.\"A King In New York\" followed. It finds Chaplin playing an usurped \"dictator\" who seeks refuge in America. Also autobiographical, the film pokes fun at various aspects of US culture, its irrational hatred of all things left-wing and the way in which humans are both always branding and refuse to look beyond the political, beyond superficial branding, to tolerate even the slightest bit of difference or dissent. Chaplin's son would play a hilarious anarcho-communist, but the film as whole messily mixed silent gags with sound comedy.Chaplin's \"A Countess from Hong Kong\" confirms that Chaplin's films were moving from the lower to the upper echelons of society. Here Sophia Loren plays a Russian \"tramp\" who is taken in by a wealthy politician (Marlon Brando). His worst feature, the film watches as \"humane\" capitalism benevolently absorbs the \"detritus\" of Russia and Asia. Chaplin accepted an honorary Oscar in 1972. He received the longest standing ovation in Oscar history.8.9/10",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin specialized in short films, which might explain that \"Modern Times\" seems a little bit too long. The film has undeniably this 'great classic' feeling that never quite deserts it, but still, somewhere in the middle, it kind of loses its track and becomes an assemblage of cute sketches without the relevance and the power of the first half.The opening of \"Modern Times\" announces an excellent satire encapsulating its era. The score almost reminds of Bernard Herrman's \"Pscyho\" music, something virtually thrilling and disturbing. Indeed, the film opens with a powerful visual metaphor, sheep running to the slaughterhouse. The image directly dissolves to workers in the subway going to factory. We're far from the laughs and tears of \"City Lights\" or \"The Kid\", Chaplin shows that he's not just a slapstick director, there's an engaged heart beating, and the movie is not just made for laughs. It's Chaplin's more mature film before \"The Great Dictator\" and only for that accomplishment, it deserves respect.And the first part doesn't disappoint this feeling. It's well crafted, with a sort of perfectionism a la \"Metropolis\", combined with an incredible social commentary on the role of the workers as human sheep in the 'Industrial New Order' \u0085 and it's just so darn funny. The part is full of iconic moments like the working chain mocking the secondary effects of the Taylorism, the eating machine, and the famous breakdown, a symbol of the alienation of a man trapped in his own condition. The iconic image of Chaplin eaten up by the whizzing gears is the perfect symbol of a man who's become part of the industrial machine. He's a piece that can be replaced any time. Chaplin clearly denounces the dehumanizing effect of industrialization when even the most basic actions must be ruled by a mechanic system, an absurdity reaching its paroxysm with the eating-machine \u0085 Chaplin even denounces the way denunciation is handled. In the scene where he was waving what seemed to be a red flag fallen from a truck, which was mistakenly taken as a protest march, a bunch of workers join him inviting the Police to put them to jail. The jail sequence is full of amusing gags, among which the one where after accidentally putting \"nose-powder\" in his plate, in an epic fight scene, Chaplin prevents prisoners from escaping and the jail becomes a haven of safety. The film doesn't just play on slapstick, there's a lot of irony going especially when, as a free man, Chaplin wants to stay, underlining the idea, that in those days, prisons at least guaranteed a roof, and regular food. The efforts, Chaplin, as the Tramp, put to go back to jail are not only hilarious but very eloquent about these hard days. A hardship endured by the heroine of the film, the Gamin.There's no Chaplin's story without romantic subplot, without the heart and the tears, and the Gamin part worked quite well. Paulette Goddard has such energy, dedication to her family, such vivacity sparkling in her eyes that \"Modern Times\" opens ours to the people's routine with the right mix of pathos and optimism. And the death of the father, and the social workers taking the orphans was a touching reminiscence of Chaplin's \"Kid\". Of course, there would be no doubt, the Gamin and the Tramp would end up together. But when they meet, something happens, it's like the romantic aspect submerged the social commentary, and maybe Chaplin meant it as a pause, but it's certainly not the highlight of the film.It happened twice so I don't think it's a coincidence if I didn't enjoy the dreamy parts, or the rediscovery of childhood's joy in the department store. The movie could have made it with the same length than \"The Kid\" and be still powerful. I also think the part where he went back to the factory was useless, we've had enough of the factory and it was perfect, why bringing back the same stuff? Chaplin is my favorite director so I must be sincere, especially since I appreciate the film, and that it doesn't end on a wrong note. Anyway, as someone said, every film should feature at least three memorable moments, in \"Modern Times\", there was the factory sequence, but it needed something else to lurch it into Pop Culture forever, among the greatest classics, and this was the Restaurant scene, \"Garbo laughs!\" for the first time in \"Ninotchka\", now, Chaplin \"speaks\"! Questioning the relevance of this scene in \"Modern Times\" would be pointless, and this reinforces my disliking of the previous scenes, which could have worked, had they been funnier. But the restaurant part still remains as one of the most enjoyable moments from any comedic film, especially when you know what will happen, when Chaplin will sing his most memorable song. It's gibberish, but the sound, the music, will become Chaplin's signature. Everything was perfect; the timing, the build-up and Paulette Goddard, as beautiful as ever, finally enchanting the screen without her dirty clothes, she was Cinderella in the ball, and her little seconds of dancing were pure beauty in motion. And Chaplin's meaningless lyrics still sound as the hymn of an era and the pride that conceding words doesn't mean making them intelligible. Chaplin knew how to make his scenes universally appealing and this one is stuck in memories forever.And the third last memorable moment comes at the end, where the Tramp and the Gamin, after so many misadventures walk into the sunset for a better future, with a shining smile in their face \u0085 this is Chaplin reminding us that it's still about optimism, about laugh and joy. And that as long as there are men with dreams, with hearts full of love, times, modern or not, will be better",

It depicts the life of a very ordinary working man, with a job in a factory when the economical state is damaged by the event that occurred in 1929.It is a very beautiful depiction of how a persons life can change when the life they know is completely ruined by a major event and how they choose to cope with the fact that their lives may never return to its original state.Another great and amazing thing about all of Charles Chaplin's movies are the other characters in all of the movies. You can sense that all of the characters of this movie were, in some way, affected by the Great Depression and that emotion is transmitted on the silver screen.The last thing I want to say was how long was my smile at the very end of the motion picture.

            "content": "\"Modern Times\" is one of the most famous films by Charlie Chaplin and \"by\" could not be more true actually because once again he was in charge of key aspects in making this film, namely direction, screenplay and lead performance. At almost 1.5 hours, this is among his longer movies and I am a bit surprised to read there is really just one version/runtime. Anyway, this is from 1936, so it will have its 85th anniversary next year. It is really not one of Chaplin's oldest works, that much is safe and the then new technology of sound in films also made it to his movies. I don't think this is really a problem. On the contrary, the used it wisely and for example when we hear these words about the feeding machine (or whatever it is called), it has something really sterile and monotonous to it, which clearly stayed in the mind. This machine is from the early parts of the film and these were the parts that I liked the most, namely when the action takes place inside that factory where Chaplin's character goes more and more crazy, which makes for some nice laughs, for example how he basically turns into a machine himself. And also all the action at the assembly line was quite hilarious too I'd say. Chaplin really worked his talent there and the big guy next to him, who constantly struggles with Chaplin being too late with his performance, made it even funnier. Honestly, if there is one job in the world that I maybe would not want to have, then it is this one. The very first shot from the film with these really many sheep and immediately after really many people was extremely telling and a nice symbolism.Unfortunately, the film gets worse qucikly once the action moves out of the factory. Good for the protagonist that the shrink could help him, but most of the other locations included in this movie did not make a big impact on me at all. First Chaplin is mistaken for a revolutionary, by definition a criminal back then apparently, and ends up in jail where he initially struggles, but then manages to help when some dangerous convicts get in control. Now this did not work at all and with that I mean the bizarre cocaine sequence that I did not find funny at all and also how he actually defeats these hunky criminals there. It just wasn't Chaplin/Tramp how we like him. He felt like Superman almost and that is not the right approach to take. So yes like in many other films, there are constant clashes between Chaplin and the law or the opposite of the law, but here rather the latter as it feels that the police are constantly on his trail and when they are not for once, then they are chasing his sweetheart. She is introduced earliy, somewhat uncreative honestly and a sob story for the sake of it with her sisters and father, but oh well. Next problem is really her scene with the bananas is such heavy overacting from Paulette Goddard that it is painful to watch honestly. Somehow I did not like her character/performance overall and as she does have a lot of screen time, that is a problem. I usually like brunettes, but she was not even physically attractive to me, so it was difficult to really cheer for her. Also there is very little to her character compared to other love interest from Chaplin films. The best example is when he asks her if she would share her life with him and the two live together in a house and she says yes so quickly, way too quickly and still the way she was thinking about it was exaggerated once again. Judging from this film (only) Goddard is not a good actress and the should have cast somebody else. Or maybe it was intentional I don't know that she does not look too good next to the male protagonist who it is all about. Maybe it is for good reason that they do not meet until halfway into the movie.However, there are other struggles too away from her. the comedy just isn't good. I said the first act as really funny and judging from that I would have given a far higher rating had they managed to keep this level, but they did not. Or I should say \"he\" because it is once again almost a one-person project again with Chaplin. Or well, maybe not that much this time because there is a much bigger cast than in almost all other works by him. You can see that he is a star already. He relies on his star appeal atg times and the cuteness and charm to his character is frequently not there. Or the really funny clumsiness like when he accidentally launches this ship into the sea and the faces of the workers afterwards were really hilarious. However, these moments are not enough and this is why I give this film a negative recommendation overall. Pretty surprised to see this is still one of the 50 highest-rated films here on imdb. I mean the final concert scene made it really obvious. The song was good and I love the French language. It sounded nice too. But it was not Chaplin. There was really zero comedy to it the moment he begins to sing until when he ends (except that him being that good also makes no sense from the story perspective with what we knew before that). It is like from a musical, but it is zero funny. This is a very different Chaplin film and clearly he was looking for new directions that could work given his approach and depicting him as a serious singer really did not turn out convincingly, even if I can see how people liekd it back then because sound was really still so new back then. Oh yeah, it may have sound, but of course it is still a black-and-white film unlike stuff like Robin Hood or The Wizard of Oz that came out really not much later. So yeah I have seen several Chaplin full feature films (by imdb standards) in the last weeks and this one here is probably my least favorite. It is also not typical Chaplin and I suggest you do not pick this one, if you want to start exploring him. There are many superior choices.",

            "content": "Known mostly as The Tramp's last motion picture, \"Modern Times\" is physical comedian and gifted writer/director/composer Charlie Chaplin's take on the quickly changing world around him. It's fitting for what's considered his last silent movie and the last hurrah of early Hollywood's most iconic figure and one of the greatest in cinematic history.In \"Modern Times\" the Tramp is fired from his assembly line job because he literally can't keep up with the grueling speed of his machine, a fantastic introduction to Chaplin's central idea of the breakneck speed of technology. He's even made the guinea pig for a new \"eat while you work\" machine that breaks during the test, resulting in the film's most comical scene. After surviving jail, the Tramp looks to find a new job, failing multiple times and dodging policemen left and right. Along the way he meets a gamin, a young orphaned woman (Paulette Goddard, Chaplin's then wife) and despite being at the bottom of the barrel, they strive to live in their own house and find work together.Throughout the film, the Tramp and his new gal desperately try and fit into a society that naturally rejects them like bad shrimp. The Tramp looks completely out of place and seems incapable (of course humorously so) of doing even the smallest of tasks, like assisting a mechanic by carrying his tools. But he will not be deterred, his ambition to live the American dream is as strong as every working class American who struggled through the tough times of that era (the film was released in 1936).It's not hard to draw a personal comparison between Chaplin's art form and the struggles of the Tramp in this film either. Silent movies were dying if not dead by the time \"Modern Times\" was released, but Chaplin was determined to prove that talking pictures were not the only suitable form of entertainment. He proves his point in an ending musical act where the Tramp speaks for the first time but must make up words because he's lost the lyrics. The ending shot is even more hopeful than the entire rest of the film.\"Modern Times\" might not be Chaplin's most hysterical physical humor, but it's certainly one of his most biting social commentaries as well as a somewhat inspiring love story. As wacky as the Tramp might be, we certainly identify with his dream and secretly admire his propensity to act outside of social norms like we ourselves wish were more comfortable doing.",

The film was made to comment on the Great Depression and the effect automation and industry had in making it happen. At least according to Chaplin himself.Beyond that the film is your typical Charlie Chaplin film. The Tramp is introduced, the Tramp faces difficulties, physical comedy segments, the Tramp meets a girl, the Tramp does something funny to impress the girl, difficulties, physical comedy, and it all ends in a funny, bittersweet yet uplifting way. If you've seen Chaplin's other films, you've seen this for the most part.That being said, the sets in this one are some of the best I've seen. Modern Times has some of the most iconic comedy scenes in cinema history for a reason. I also really like the heroine played by Paulette Goddard. A girl of spunk, character and resources, who takes care of the Tramp more than he takes care of her, which is a refreshing turnabout. Especially for a film this old.Modern Times is a fine film. Personally I do find it a bit too segmented to be a great film, and Chaplin's style of humour has never been my forte. But it's a fine film, no doubt about it.",

Silent films were long gone, and talkies were the thing of the future. Being Chaplin's last silent film he decided it was right to say goodbye to the little tramp. Anyways let's look at the plot. The tramp (Chaplin) is a factory worker. Chaplin illustrates his views on industry here by showing us huge gears and his daunting assembly line job. Chaplin inadvertently scares people when having a mental breakdown so he is sent to a hospital. After release he is inadvertently held as a communist and arrested again. After that Chaplin meets an orphan (Paulette Goddard) the oldest of her siblings who tries to provide for them. Chaplin and Goddard decide to make a life together and find a home and a job. The trouble is Chaplin always seems to get himself arrested after every job. After the final job that he has fires him too, the tramp and the girl walk off assured that they will make it somehow. This is just another one of those perfect films. The characters find trouble but you feel good for them in the end. Also Chaplin is just as funny as ever. I highly recommend this film.

The uncertainty of a world that in the measure of its modernity, excludes the individual and the spaces for the human feeling.\"Modern Times\" uses the facet of satire and at certain times of the parody to result in a critical and conscious comedy. It promotes a laughter contained in a world where the population is comparable to a flock grazed by large corporations and corporations, and even being a film scripted and directed by Charlie Chaplin in 1936, has a strong prophetic or futuristic character, timeless and certainly helplessness, when we reflect In the position of the contemporary world.Chaplin in \"Modern Times\" already philosophized on so many important issues that when reviewing his films, we were amazed by his futuristic vision in terms of technology with surveillance systems monitored by cameras, a mix of reality show with face time, (Such as Skype), voice messaging (WhatsApp), digital recording, and the interference of man's banal activities, such as having lunch, being interfered with by machines and everything to ensure more work efficiency, Wasted time with human activities.In addition to the technological advances, there is in the film, or at least in its first part, an analysis of the effects and reflexes of modernity on man and the world, expressed by relations of subordination and power, by the totalitarianism of business groups and by the inexpressiveness of trade union movements Which result in meager advances and are brutally repressed by the police force. A well-presented paradox in the film is how man has managed to advance in technological modernities that, on the other hand, only increase the differences of social classes, generating groups concentrated by industrial power and a whole mass that is at the mercy of a great employment opportunity Part exploratory and enslaved. Living in miserable conditions, in a daily struggle for survival and without the prospect of a better future, there is nothing left but a passive position of the people, who fulfills their expectations with dreams and fantasies of consumption and a life less unworthy.The critical character of \"Modern Times\" knows how to measure well the moments of comedy, in fact, they mix in a homogeneous mass so well structured that allows the public, if it so wishes, to stick only to moments of comedy, but if you want, Just look more closely and we can see and see our world through a critical humor perspective. Perhaps the fear of Chaplin and his tramp Carlitos is the fear of the common man. The uncertainty of a world that in the measure of its modernity, excludes the individual and the spaces for the human feeling.Particularly, I believe in an attempt by Chaplin to soften his critical stance, for, in structuring the script of \"Modern Times,\" the story is divided into chapters that resemble chapters, and which can, as a filmmaking feature, be relocated without Major implications, since the dependence of one chapter does not strongly interfere with another. This structure that border the sketch or \"sketch\", are, in my opinion, a weak and harmful feature to the film. So much that the resolution for this is a passage of days, there are no missing cards that inform the next action (chapter), it occurs ten, seven, five, two days later or within weeks. This division is so explicit that we can structure the film in the following way:Chapter I - Factory; Chapter II - The Prisoner of the Tramp Chapter III - The Life of the Poor Girl;Just in the middle of the movie, we have an unfolding of this critical and political comedy for a romantic comedy that nothing resembles the initial idea proposed to the film. The only vestige that remains of this trait is in the labor relations, the search for a job and a change of life.With the proviso to the slip of his narrative structure, you had a great work, and one more impeccable work of Chaplin. When \"Modern Times\" was made, cinema already had the sound feature, but Chaplin, mainly for his ideologies of creating a universal art cinema, which was not hampered by differences of languages \u200b\u200band other motives, remained faithful to the comic of mimicry , Which made him deservedly famous and admired all over the world.Conversely to those who say of their fear of using the soundtrack, we have in this film a Chaplin conscious of the advances of the sound and that knows to take advantage of that, the sound is presented as a technology that allows the sending of recorded messages, in the sound games like beats In the door that serve to confuse the actions, in the use of a radio to inhibit the sound of the gastritis and where the radio announcer remembers exactly to take the medicine to heal this evil and especially the sound, like match point of the history. If the hobo can not get a joint job, how about trying life as an artist? But for this it is necessary to sing, therefore he who never speaks. The result",

Chaplin has seldom faulted and here he is standing at his genius best.So many elements are new in this, the effect of industrialization on humans. The need and greed for money. Craving for love and doing work so as to keep the lover happy. This is one of the most poignant films culturally and on humanitarian terms. Charlie as the Tramp delivers an immaculate performance that is a treat to watch. From being a hero in jail and struggles outside of jail. He comes to terms with the world that has become a flock, like flock of sheep that braze on grass, humans now braze on their new jobs as workers in factories. OK, technically, this is a Silent film, now considering 1936 where the \"talkies\" have become regular in Hollywood, it seemed somewhat anachronistic. Yet, had the tramp spoke he would have become one among many, a common man and his mystic characteristics might have surfaced and he would have lost his charm. So it was a good thing that it was kept silent just for the sake of maintaining the uniqueness of \"The Tramp\".There are so many unique things in this film that even today, it would to be tough to scale the magnanimity of the sets involved, the charm of the love story and the simplicity of the humor. Be it a scene where he looks at buttons of a woman as nut and bolts trying to fix them, or his fall into the damp water realizing that it is not a lake or pond. So many moments are beautiful and simple and this is one of the rarest films, that will bring laughter irrespective of time and age. And it indeed brings a tear drop at times too. Emotions are universal, and the better connected they are, more beautiful the film will be. Chaplin knew the art if film making, yes and more than that he knew the art of being a simple human being. What it takes to live a life simply, what goes through a simple man trying to earn his bread. What goes through a lover who is trying to win the heart of a girl. He knew all this so well and many traits of his thoughts have surface in this film, making it a wonderful film and how many times ever I watch this, I never got bored and I never will. To distinctly say that so and so in this film is wonderful would be demeaning the essence of the film. So, everything is superb and I can bet on this for laughs any time. A 5/5 for one of the greatest films ever.",

And the beginning seems to give us voices through machines ... well it is fitting for a movie called Modern Times ... of course considering where we are now, the times may not seem too modern. Although the CCTV thing (invention) was quite ahead of its time.Chaplin is universal - and while this is a movie where you hear people talk, it still is mostly gestures and impressions/faces. Many things stay silent - except for music, which you had anyway, even with the silent movies - where you had music accompany the movie. But back to Chapling being universal - anyone could understand him, when he was just doing his usual thing. Moving his body, facial expressions and so forth. No matter the generation, no matter the age (young or old), everyone was getting him and the jokes/humor.The movie right here is a bit of a piece work. And I believe the commentator that having a woman center piece was quite new - I reckon not just for Chaplin, but also for him. A woman whom he took a liking to and was also romantically involved. Why they broke up, as in if the talking pictures had anything to do with it ... well maybe there is a documentary who will bring light into it. Does not play a role in the movie anyway (no pun intended).The sketches or whatever you want to call them, work ... it may seem like patchwork at times, but it is a whole movie. And a very good one at that. Modern times was in fact ahead of its time. I missed watching them and I look forward watching more of the so called classics. The Criterion Collection has quite a few extras - some behind the scenes pictures are showing Charlie without a mustache ... and I have to admit I did not recognize him at first ...

There was a section that didn't need to be included - the 2nd time the machinery gag was used and the boss's head gets stuck. Paulette Goddard had some good moments, eg, she knows how to get by on the street and it's quite satisfying to see her going to bed in the department store, but I felt that she was too old for the character that she was playing. No way was she a teenager! I found the film funny. It's a love story with hope and it gives us the great message that you can have absolutely nothing and still be happy. Chaplin has converted me.

The work is there to be had and even the little tramp is gainfully employed. Sadly, a form of RSI sees him have a breakdown and find himself jailed. A series of fortunate events see the tramp foil a jailbreak and earn himself his freedom but life is almost harder on the streets now, with unemployment and crime soaring.Considered one of his classics, Modern Times was of course going to be one of the film that I come one when brushing up on my film education. Opening with a wonderfully tongue-in-cheek caption, the film delivers a story about one of the masses, lost in a world of working to earn enough to get by, where individualism is not encouraged and the pressure to do more with less is always on. Sadly it is a relevant theme more than 70 years later as it was then and I was looking for something sharp from it in this regard. I suspect it was my expectation rather than anything else but I was surprised that it didn't have more in terms of teeth towards authority figures. Instead it takes the softer root of supporting the little guy rather than attacking the big one \u0096 the message of the film appearing to be \"don't let the b*stards get you down\".So in this area I did not get what I expected, but this was not a \"failing\" of the film so much as of my expectations of it. In the area of comedy the film does deliver with plenty of wonderfully delivered gags and routines. Of course the classic clips we've all seen are here (Chaplin going through the cogs of the machine) but there are plenty of other moments that are funny. Chaplin's delivery makes most of the material of course. It is testament to his talent that he did the same character so often but yet made it funny every time: his physical work is great. He is well supported by Goddard, who is fresh, charming and gorgeous even in rags, she really makes her character important. Sandford, Alexander, Conklin and others do well with Chaplin to deliver the physical routines.Do I think that Modern Times will wow audiences as it once did? Well, no because it is not sharp enough to build on the laughs. However this is not to suggest the film is not good, because it is very good. The story may lack teeth but it is warming while the routines and gags may vary in regards how famous they are but all very funny.",

Basically a factory worker, let's just call him the Tramp, is struggling to keep up with machinery of the modern society, specifically tightening bolts on plates. He is at one point selected to try out a new experimental employee feeding machine to speed up production and breaks, but of course the boss is unconvinced. It is when the Tramp gets stuck in the large cogs of the machine that he has a nervous breakdown, where he has a laugh mucking up, and this takes him to prison. Meanwhile an orphan girl known only as Gamine (Paulette Goddard) faces going into a home with her sisters, but she manages to escape and is scrounging to get by. When the Tramp has been released he is immediately put back in when he is mistaken for the leader for a communist parade waving the red flag. In prison he is out of place, but at the same time he prefers to modern society, and when he mistakes cocaine for salt and he unintentionally foils a breakout he is rewarded with release. This release leads the Tramp to meeting Gamine stealing a loaf bread and trying to take the blame to go back to prison, and again getting himself loads of food without paying. He does get arrested for this and sees Gamine in the paddy wagon, but it crashes and they tumble out to make something of themselves, specifically the Trap getting a job in a department store as night watchman. After initially starting out well, the Tramp is caught in a pile of womens' clothes and arrested again, and when he is released ten days later Gamine meets him to show him their new home. She has found a run down old shack house almost falling apart, and while hanging in it and breaking some planks, the Tramp reads a new factory is hiring, and he manages to get a job. Soon enough just after starting, and getting a co-worker caught in a mess, they finds out the workers are on strike, and he gets arrested again because of a brick. Two weeks later, the Tramp is released and finds Gamine working as a caf\u00e9 dancer, and she tries to get him a job as a waiter/singer. He fails at the waiter job getting a duck all over the place, but he proves a worthy singer with his own improvised piece which proves a hit. In the end, Gamine is wanted for arrest, but she and the Tramp manage to get out of the caf\u00e9, and the films ends with them starting a life on the road. Also starring Henry Bergman as Cafe Proprietor, Stanley 'Tiny' Sandford as Big Bill, Chester Conklin as Mechanic, Hank Mann as Burglar and Stanley Blystone as Sheriff Couler. Chaplin is lovable, Goddard is lovely as the troubled love interest, the feeding machine scene is great fun, and the other slapstick moments are memorable viewing, so it is a must see silent (there are sound effects and some dialogue) comedy.

A lot of predictable, obvious, unclever slapstick, and awful lot of it really contrived or just stupid (I longed for death during the interminable scene where he goes round and round the dance floor carrying the tray).But the worst part of all was the \"social commentary\" aspect. This film is pure Luddite-ism. In a nutshell, Chaplin couldn't handle the fact that technology-- talkies-- was displacing him and his silent movie approach, and so he railed against all technology. NINE YEARS after talkies came in, he's still stubbornly clinging to silents; apparently these \"talking pictures\" are just a fad. It's the most pathetic of crusades.Oh, and it's not hard to see why people thought Chaplin was a communist. The character of the owner of the steel mill might as well have leapt off the pages of Marx himself, he's such a grotesque caricature of a capitalist, sitting around doing jigsaw puzzles, reading comics, and yelling at the proletariat to work faster.Happily, for the most part, the movie doesn't maintain this virulently anti-capitalistic tone. But its attempt to capture the pathos of the depression is itself pathetic. When the factory reopens, Chaplin exclaims \"Work at last!\"-- but the reality is that he's already had THREE jobs during the movie, and he lost ALL of them through his own incompetence, not because of the depression. The great moral stance that this movie takes is that it glorifies bunglers and thieves.Let it not be said, though, that I found nothing good in the film. Chaplin's stunt work (I assume that was actually him) in the blindfolded rollerskating scene is mindbogglingly good. Truly remarkable.

Of course, people should be the masters of the machines. The movie, however, pokes poignant fun at how machines have reversed the roles by becoming the masters over people. Of course, this mastery is presided over by an all-seeing owner, who must further mechanize (the automatic feeding machine, for example) or risk losing out to the competition.Chaplin manages to make his points in a number of amusing set-ups that are also poignant in what they reveal. For example, Chaplin's getting pulled into the machine's great digestive cog system amounts to a stunning metaphor. Of course, this was also during the Great Depression, so the threat of unemployment and starvation acted as goads to putting up with all the on-the-job humiliation (being surveilled in the bathroom, for example). Also, Chaplin's use of crowds of unemployed and cordons of mounted police makes its point without need of dialog.I suppose it's not surprising that the nation's anti-communist watchdog committee, HUAC, would 10 years later find a movie like this suspect. But, it strikes me that anyone finding the movie's overall humane message politically objectionable has already been absorbed into the machinery Chaplin so shrewdly satirizes.",

It is forever talked about and made by a Director/Star who is relentlessly talked about and most likely anyone involved in Film History or just casual lovers of the Art will never go silent on the famous Chaplin.Charlie did shut up for the longest time. Here in 1936 he bucked all trends and common sense to produce a \"silent\" picture with the most amazing result. It seems that it is so well conceived, so rich in Sociology, so funny in its slapstick and biting satire that once the sheep were herded into the theaters everyone instantly forgot this was a Silent Movie.There are numerous set pieces that are part of the social consciousness and subconscious of American life that will remain as long as there is a collective. A sense that we all belong in some sort of macro life force and have the ability to empathize, and have an awareness of our social structure and can feel. Chaplin felt deeply. It is obvious in his Art. In real life he paid a price for anti-establishment views and expressions of discontent. But he never lost the Love and respect from his admirers and Fans. This Movie is considered one of his best. It is, because of its insights and sight gags, its heart and its mindful attempt to enlighten while entertaining.",

            "content": "OK so in essence this movie perhaps is like the just as brilliant French comedy \"\u00c0 nous la libert\u00e9\" but \"Modern Times\" is a real classic on its own right. To be honest I think that some Chaplin movies and other classic comedies in general are a bit overrated but \"Modern Times\" always had been a movie which I enjoyed watching.\"Modern Times\" is Charlie Chaplin's protest about the fast growing modern industrial society (seems a like a pretty silly to protest against now days of course). It makes fun of industrialism, with as a result some highly amusing and innovative sequences, when things start to go wrong in the factory, when the tramp starts to loose his mind. This spoof and protest however got him in trouble though, since the American government was not amused by it and labeled him as a communist from that moment on. After that Chaplin left to live for the rest of his love in Switzerland and he never returned to America.Although the movie does feature sound in it, the movie is still shot as a silent movie and also features hardly any dialog in it. It makes this movie of course quite unique and I actually wonder if the movie would had been better if it did feature full sound and more dialog in it. I really don't think so though. Charles Chaplin of course always had been a king of slapstick and silent comedy.Chaplin is in good form in this movie. He shows off his silly antics as his famous tramp character, although in this movie his character is simply listed as 'A factory worker'. His timing and execution is fine as always and provides the movie with moments that will make you laugh, guaranteed. Also Paulette Goddard is fine and looking lovely in this movie. She married Chaplin the same year but then again which co-star didn't Chaplin had a fling with throughout his life.Like so often he also directed and wrote the movie. With this he shows that he not just had a talent for comedy acting but also really for comical writing and directing. For a silent slapstick movie the movie simply features a good and likable story. Also the directing is done with lots of pace and sense for timing.It also has some great looking sets, for factory sequences of course most obviously.A great Chaplin classic!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Chaplin focuses on the plight of the working man, and while his message is pretty well always hidden beneath hilarious and inventive gags, it nonetheless remains poignant. He frequently takes pot shots at the greedy factory owner, showing him as unconcerned with the work-conditions of his employees and driven solely by the desire for profit.For me, the film's dual-purpose makes it extra appealing. Being a Chaplin film, it is hilarious throughout, with scenes of Chaplin being forced to eat from an insane feeding machine (to increase productivity), and him inadvertently becoming the leader of a Communist demonstration. The extra appeal comes from its teeth, though. Chaplin obviously had some strong feelings towards the issue of the individual's exploitation at the hands of the corporate machine, and these feelings permeate throughout the entire film. And, best of all, he manages to mix the meaning with the humor so well that often you'll be unsure whether to laugh or to reflect on what the man was saying. My tip is, do both.",

            "content": "The myth of the Garden of Eden is so potent because it is true.  When I was younger, I was innocently enraptured by Chaplin and his balletic sense of physical movement, and thought all his films were works of shining genius. But the more I read about them, and the more I learnt about cinema, the less miraculous they seemed.  Critics' nagging made me see all the flaws, the hesitant construction, the lack of visual inventiveness, the replacement of emotional depth or ideas with sentimentality, especially in comparison with his dark contemporary, Buster Keaton.  The apple of knowledge had soured a little my taste for the Little Tramp.So how does 'Modern Times', a film I once considered his masterpiece, and one of the great American movies, hold up?  Pretty well, actually.  While you look in vain for the layers and nuances of a Keaton, it is heartening to think that a film like this was made in the largely escapist Hollywood of the 1930s.  It might seem trite to us now, but can you imagine what a largely working class audience must have felt seeing themselves compared to penned sheep at the beginning of a comedy?  That first sequence, of automated men going to work in a ghostly, futuristic city is haunting, owing as much to T.S. Eliot's 'The Waste Land' as Lang's 'Metropolis'.Similarly, it is fashionable to mock Chaplin's political commitment, and not just in the light of his tax-exile in a Swiss chateau.  It is true that every time the tramp is thrust unwillingly into a collective, a political protest, a strike or demonstration, he manages to duck it, his individuality shunning group responsibility.  It is also true that the Victorian mugging of the Tramp and the gamin contrast with the rough facelessness of the masses.  But in what other film, American or otherwise, in the period or now, will you see vicious policeman brutally attacking peaceful protestors, or have theft, flight and mockery of authorities shown as economic neccessities? The taking over the department store by convicts, thieves, juvenile delinquents and the unemployed may not be as potent as the Last Supper scene in 'Viridiana', but it comes close, and how many Americans actually saw Bunuel's film?My comparison to Bunuel is not entirely gratuitous, and is one way of insisting on Chaplin's modernity, to rescue him from a ghetto of expert vaudeville.  There is one scene where the Tramp, the Gamin and a policeman fall out of a prison van.  We don't see the physical act of falling, just the scatter of bodies.  The framing of this shot, the stillness, the silver stylisation, the lighting, the gestures, jerk the film out of slapstick comedy into something as magical as Cocteau.  A later scene, the Tramp dreaming of domestic life with the Gamin, is a superbly comic variation on this.Another sign of Chaplin's modernity is the treatment of the Tramp.  If we see him as a continuous character, he might seem insufferably unctuous.  But the Tramp isn't a coherent character, but a cipher who fits the demands of wildly differing scenes, who serves as a figure with which Chaplin makes satirical points.  He is no more psychologically plausible than, say, Candide.  His appalling treatment of his co-workers in the factory, his decency to the Gamin, his life in prison cannot be plausibly reconciled as coherent character development.This makes the narrative and the form that contains it more interesting and full of tensions.  For instance, in the opening factory sequence, there is an obvious opposition between the worlds of management and workers which is dramatised in the difference between silent and sound cinema, the latter linked to authority (the boss speaks and looks through cameras and cinema screens), the former is physical, disruptive, linked to the body, a real body that, even just tweaked a little, can destroy the mechanical body of a huge firm (and maybe the body politic?).  When the automated worker becomes a human, his disruption is expressed as sexual, as, in wonderfully bisexual fashion, he tweaks and chases workers and women (how did they get some of these scenes past Hays?).'Modern Times' might seem like a ragbag of barely connected sketches, but the governing metaphor of the film is the circle, from the clock over the opening credits and the circular mechanisms of the huge assembly-line machine, to the circles the Tramp skates, or the dance moves as he does his singing act.  The circularity of mechanised life, of doing the same routine, is formalised by a structure in which the Tramp ends each sequence where he began, having to pick himself up and start again, hence the physical circles he makes.  But the circle is at least familiar and reassuring - you know at least what's coming up.  When the Tramp and Gamin finally break it, take to a straight road, we have no more idea than they do of what will happen to them, as brave a Hollywood ending as there has been, and probably the reason Fellini loved Chaplin so much and, yeah, me too.I would only like to add that Paulette Goddard is a remarkablly rare thing in a Chaplin film, a non-simpering woman - her bug-eyed first appearance, stealing bananas from a boat, knife in hand, and later eating a very suggestive spoil, throb with fierce, libidinal energy, like some demon from a German Expressionist film.  And yet she convincingly matures into a strong, loving woman, one who gets her man a job.  The other thing, continuing the theme of the physical body, is perhaps cinema's first gross-out sequence, as the Tramp as convict and a vicar's wife belch-spar each other.",

            "content": "Of all the timeless classics Charlie Chaplin came up with throughout his decades-spanning film career, Modern Times remains my absolute favourite. A perfect farewell to the era that made him a household name all over the globe and permanently engraved his legacy in the annals of cinema, Modern Times is the final silent feature film from Charlie Chaplin and also marks the last appearance of his signature character on the film celluloid.A satirical take on industrial age & modern society, Modern Times follows the adventures of The Little Tramp who undergoes a nervous breakdown while working rigorously in a factory & is placed in a mental institution. Once out, he's mistakenly arrested during a Communist demonstration & put in jail again. Finally, he manages to secure a job temporarily & meets a young homeless woman with whom he tries to survive the modern, industrialized world.Written, produced, directed & scored by Charlie Chaplin, Modern Times presents his critical view on the transition America was going through during the Great Depression and how the reckless industrialization had reduced human labour to just another piece of machinery. The story is infused with social commentary from beginning to end but it doesn't rob its viewers from having a good time for Modern Times is possibly the funniest film Chaplin ever made.Crafted at a time when silent cinema had become a thing of the past, the film isn't silent in the traditional sense for it makes effective use of sound effects & also marks the first time we get to hear Chaplin's voice on the film canvas. And the technical aspects are refined to the smallest of details under Chaplin's supervision for sets are meticulously detailed, black n white photography efficiently captures the unfolding events and Editing keeps a firm grip on its pacing & action.The slapstick humour is used to perfection and there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to be found in this film. From the moment we meet our protagonist on the assembly line to his final walk down the road, there isn't a moment when the film stops being funny and even after nearly 8 decades, it retains its ability to make its viewers collapse from laughing. How Chaplin continued to find ways that effortlessly evoked laughter & admiration from the ever- changing audience is a strong testament to why he is still second to none.The background score in an amalgamation of adventurous, sweet & melancholic tracks that are seamlessly integrated into the story and enhances the whole experience by a great deal. Coming to the performances, Chaplin is at his craziest here and the nervous breakdown his character undergoes in the first act is hilarious as hell. And that's just one of the too many rib-tickling segments present in the picture. Paulette Goddard also does an outstanding job in her first major role, and her chemistry with Chaplin is endearing to watch.On an overall scale, Modern Times is a masterwork of perfection from the perfectionist that bids an ideal farewell to the silent era of filmmaking, remains one of the finest achievements of Chaplin's illustrious career & is rightfully acknowledged as one of the greatest films ever made. Just like every other Chaplin film, it has endured the test of time & will continue to do so for as long as cinema lives. The final image of The Little Tramp walking down the road as the camera fades is poignant to watch but then, Chaplin couldn't have ended the journey of his most memorable creation on a more perfect note. A definite must for everyone.",

            "content": "Modern Times is a social critique of the new technology that dehumanizes people, and a powerful statement against the technology and rules that inhibit progress. Chaplin clearly holds an anti-\"system\" stance, and both his character and his leading lady refuse to reform. He likens industrial workers to sheep in an early montage, and squirts oil on them during his nervous breakdown, likening them to cogs in the machinery or automations. They are never depicted as humans. The most striking scenes often include shots of the machinery in the factory. When Chaplin is trapped in the machinery, he literally becomes a cog in the wheel, totally replaceable since he is fired soon after. Near the end of the film, he is again working in a factory and a long shot presents the machinery towering over the men, literally overpowering them and figuratively dominating their world. When a second man is stuck in the machinery, the viewer sees how the technology literally consumes his life, and he is not happy. He repeatedly yells to get him out, because humans have a natural desire to fight off the technology that oppresses and contains them.By taking technological mishaps to the extreme, Chaplin presents a powerful statement about progress. The Deluxe Feeding Machine spills hot soup on Chaplin, the mouth wiper slaps him, and the corn cob makes sizzling noises as he tries to eat it. This machine does not serve its purpose of feeding, but rather reduces Chaplin's power over himself and takes an aggressive role against him. In another lunch scene in the factory, Chaplin has to feed another man his lunch because he cannot serve himself; he is reduced to the level of a baby. Chaplin clearly holds a very strong view of what technology is doing to men in making them everything but men. The assembly line process gives Chaplin a weird walk with kinks, a comment on the strain of doing that kind of tedious work. This scene complements a montage of workers on strike, factories closing, and industrial people out of work, tying the movie's humor to the real life seriousness of the industrial process. While all of these people are out of work, only two fix the idle machine that is useless, unfixable and inefficient. Without it, many people would have work and be doing a better job.The other major setting of the film is the jailhouse, the scene for Chaplin's attack on \"rules.\" Chaplin is arrested three times, once (wrongly) for leading a strike. Ironically, the conditions of the jail are better than the constant search for work and attempt to conform to societal norms. Chaplin tries to return to jail, where civilization seems to lay in this ridiculous world. Here he is treated as a human and has tea with the minister's wife. He who is viewed as a criminal is innocent and those typical criminal robbers of the department store we come to pity because they are simply hungry. It seems the \"system\" is as inefficient as the factory machines because the arrests, paperwork to find wanted people, and strikes waste time that could be spent finding work for the millions unemployed.Chaplin shows his contempt for the \"system\" in his statement that he would get a home even if he \"has to work for it.\" He does not enjoy following the rules, which is why he is so often out of work, but even he espouses the suburban ideals of America that so many cannot attain. He makes the audience consider the inequity of wealth with his first humble abode that constantly falls apart. His critique comes through strongest in the closing scene. Both the orphan girl and he have jobs, nice clothes, and success, demonstrating that the individual can succeed when given the opportunity to have the spotlight. They can not succeed when they are just one of a million other \"sheep.\" When they walk off into the sunset, they are two people against the \"system\" smiling as they walk down the road to opportunity, away from authority, industry, technology, and the silliness of the established rules.In a purely technical aspect, Chaplin reinforces his critique by largely ignoring the available addition of sound. Sound is linked to the dehumanization of people and is only used with those linked to machinery. He believed this new technology in the film industry would detract from the truer human emotions and messages that had been perfected in silent films. Modern Times is a perfect example, as the indigestion scene is a type of crass humor that does not work as well as the visual humor he presents. Chaplin has a physical grace and power over himself and each scene, giving him an aura of control that extends to audience interpretations of the film. In this film too, he perfects his portrayal of \"The Little Tramp,\" a misfit in society. He stands for our common humanity and is the hero that transcends the oppression of the industrial machines, rules, and society. Chaplin is not just a talented filmmaker; he is also an astute social critic.",

            "content": "Modern Times (1936) :\nBrief Review -A satirical take on struggle during unemployment era couldn't get more hilarious and genius than this. Modern Times, often cited as Chaplin's best satirical work ever is definitely underrated as a comedy. I don't see many people talking about how hilarious and funny it is and all the way intelligently, not mad comedy. In my opinion, this is Chaplin's most intelligently choreographed comedy ever. Many comic situations and funny sequences in this film feels impossible and unbelievable, just like we saw in Buster Keaton's adventurous comedies. The question that how did Charles Chaplin managed to perform all the scenes so perfectly without any fumbles is still eating my head. That first scene when he's working in the factory then the Robbery scene and so many and at last the Waiter's scene in the hotel all are simply stupendous. Modern Times lacks the emotional touch and impulsive Nature, may be because it was set on serious issues like industrialization and commercialization, however, the Satire is perfectly built by Chaplin. The film tells a story of a tramp who struggles to live in modern industrial society with the help of a young homeless woman while both of them are in search of employment. As always, Chaplin gives an inspiring message from the film and this time it is, \"Never give up, we'll get along\". Modern Times came very late for a silent film as Talkies had became popular by 1936. The same film in silent era i.e before 30s would have had bigger legacy left. Nevertheless, Modern Times is still a Classic and a timeless entertainer for all ages. The similar concept was presented by Chaplin later in 'Monsieur Verdoux' which was hardly a comedy, so naturally this one more enjoyable.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest.",

Story depicted the life of the working class and in one scene Chaplin was arrested also for raising voice for workers , although he not have done it intentionally. The situation of the job crisis gives him the idea that Jail was much more peaceful and better for him, even when he was released. Even when in the Jail he fought against some troublemakers , he was not in proper state of mind , which is a good humorous way to depict that peoples actually are not with the police or the administration. But the depiction was so beautifully done that decoding is also easier for the audience\n3. The main female character also here a part of the suffering society which sensitively affected by job crisis and overwork issue. And that pushed her to steal food for her motherless sisters. Depicting the poverty and this crisis situation is not regular or normal for western society film, most of the time they try to depict it with some larger than life characters, super heroes or war etc kind of subject with glamour , violence , colorful content in their films, with entertaining music etc. to focus mainly on business but Modern Times , in a humorous way brought the shortcomings, inequalities, discrepancies in the society , in a manner that it will keep on bouncing from laughter, enjoyment to sadness , melancholy mood. This film take audience to a proper emotional journey to make them understand their real situation around\n4. Modern Times is a story for all time.. Even today this film can be aligned with present condition of workers and the society in most of the cities. A must watch for all.",

The boss wanting to maximize production, worker's strikes, drug use, jail life, he has to actually work to make money isn't always true, and life isn't always that grand; where Matchstick Men has a feel good ending that is false here Chaplin ends his film genuinely in a bittersweet ending.  It still amuses me how he was locked up in the film for mistakenly being labelled a Communist while in a few years he is prevented from reentering the US.\nIt's worth watching many, many times.

            "content": "Modern Times is Chaplin's take on the desperate employment and fiscal conditions that people faced during the Great Depression that hit the world between the 1930s and lasted till the late 1930s or mid-1940s. Charlie Chaplin took the depression and the problems it caused and found a way to make you laugh it off. Modern times is an addition to the classic movies of the last 100 years, as it stands out as one extremely funny movie, that you have to see before you leave the earth.Modern times is a movie done in 1936, that depicts Chaplin's take on the modern world and what industrialization brought with it. Set during the Great Depression era the movie's plot is about how the tramp was coping with the depression and with him was an orphan who too was struggling with the causes of the depression.Our Tramp also discovered that life in jail is better than life outside.Chaplin had long been against \"talkie\" and his last film before this City Lights (1931) was a silent film and he began preparing for this flick in 1934, and it was supposed to be his first \"talkie\", but he later abandoned the idea of making a talkie because he felt the world was not ready to hear the tramp talk. The movie does have some dialogue, but that can be found in the early scenes soon after the movie went back to the silent film genre. Nearing the ending there is a scene where Chaplin's tramp had to sing to keep his job, this scene was the first film where Chaplin's voice is heard in any movie. The song that the tramp sang (the song is known as The Nonsense Song) was L\u00e9o Daniderff's comical song Je cherche apr\u00e8s Titine. This is one of my favorite scenes in the movie as Chaplin's version of L\u00e9o Daniderff's song was all gibberish with the lyrics being a mixture of French and Italian words in a nonsensical manner that it made no sense but his comical gestures tell the story of what he actually meant.The movie's opening scene shows where the tramp was in a factory and he had to keep up with the speed of production, this scene has been used by many filmmakers even Disney and in the sitcom I Love Lucy used the idea.Modern Times, is my 2nd favorite Chaplin movie after City Lights and the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) rated the movie78 in its list of 100. There is no reason why you should not get a feel of one of the best Chaplin's film out there, so find it and watch it.www.lagsreviews.com",

            "content": "The ending is heartwarming and there are a few standout scenes here - Charlie's song and dance at the end, his rollerskating through the department store, and the factory machine feeding early on, but otherwise it is short on laughs, and the story feels like some loosely pieced together fragments that don't totally belong together.The 1930's camera seems drunk on its ability to move freely, and as such can't stand still, panning slightly this way and that, and dollying when there is no cause to, and all the while being completely unable to mask the lack of laughs - the complete opposite of Charlie's best work, which could make you laugh despite the most simple of camera set ups.It is also difficult to believe the lead female is in poverty. She is made up, beautiful, dressed nicely enough, and has a face full of laughter and charisma - impossible to believe the circumstances of her life have been too difficult, as the film wishes us too. The apparent confusion on whether it ought to be a silent or sound film adds to the problems, sometimes giving title cards and sometimes spoken word, and to top it all off, even Charlie's performance is not at his usual high standard - tending to overplay things.Thematically it is splitting. On the one hand it may be an argument for creativity and individuality amongst a rigid, soul-sucking, mechanical world - and this is a fine message - but on the other hand it glorifies thieves. All things considered, I would say modernization did not suit Charlie very well.",

            "content": "A Film by Charles Chaplin as Writer,Producer,Lead Actor,Composer of Musical Score. with Paulette Goddard,Henry Bergman,Tiny Sandford,Chester Conklin,Hank Mann,Stanley Blystone,Allan Garcia,Richard Alexander, etc,etc...... Mr. Charles Chaplin saw himself as a sort of \"Champion of the oppressed, the Figting Hero of the Little Guy\",a sort of real-life Charles Foster Kane; albeit one with his own motion pictures to use, rather than the mythical newspaper, The Daily Inquirer. To a high degree, this was largely true.His Little Tramp character was indeed a reflection of all of the countless anonymous, ordinary folk who go about their business, day in and day out, looking for no help from government or anyone else. Charlie's character is much more than an image of a man in a story. He is a sort of symbol, often times functioning like an editorial cartoon.Chaplin was also fortunate to have been a man of good business sense, as well as a singularly gifted Actor/Artist/Director/Writer/Composer. He always had a keen interest in Political and Socio-Economic systems, including the then fashionable types of Socialism in the world. This favourite party-time talk fodder was little more than that, in that he was never too willing to open up his check book in order to aid either the Fabian Socialists or Joe Stalin's Gang or whoever else. None the less, this interest would help to categorize him as \"an Undesirable Alien\", who was refused re-entry into the USA in 1952. As a further indication of his Business Sense, he had the re-release of the gems from his vault coincide with his triumphant return to the United States after 20 years exile.* That's enough of that business. We've all heard it before. Let's get on with the examination and evaluation of this film, this MODERN TIMES (1936).Chaplin definitely was also a champion of another cause, almost one at that. This would be the Silent Movie form. Here was a movie type, previously the only kind, but by now, the mid '30's, that was now old hat, pass\u00e9, outmoded, old fashioned and all but deserted. Yet Charlie made fine use of the art form of the silents twice in what we will call the \"Post JAZZ SINGER (1927) Age\". Twice in the decade of the 1930's a Chaplin Feature was made as a Silent, the sound track being used for musical score and some sound effects.In this MODERN TIMES the period viewed by our 1972 audience was then nearly 40 years old. It could be even older in a sense; the period in which young Mr. Chaplin formed his attitudes and opinions would set this story,attitudinally,back to a Pre-World War I society.So, we saw a serio-comic look at Industrialization, Labor Relations, Economic Boom, Governmental \"assistence\", Red Tape and uncontrollable human emotions of true love and despair(leading to suicide!). In presentation of such matters, the Writer/Director was wise in spreading all the \"bitter pills\" throughout the story.And the scenario itself is slowly developed. The elements of the story line are given plenty of cushioning. The plot is unfolded in a series of extended situations, using different circumstances, changing settings. It is almost as if there were 5 or 6 2 Reelers contained within this one Supersized Comedy.Whereas this is a Chaplin homage to the Silent Screen, it was also their Swan Song. Sir Charles realized that no one, not even the Little Tramp would or could delay the eventual inevitable for very long. Here are several instances of dialog on the sound track. Other than a fine comical song an dance by the Little Tramp ,the other 3 or 4 occasions of sound all originate in a mechanical devise, Radio, Closed circuit television or phonograph record.So MODERN TIMES bids a fond farewell to not only the silent, but to a style of writing. In his previous films, the rule of thumb was avoid the use of Proper Names for the character in favor of only the descriptive terms of the characters in the story. Hence, we had terms like \"a Tramp\", \"a Gamin\", \"the Mayor\", a Drunk\", \"a Millionaire\", \"a Factory Worker\", etc., etc. (For some reason \"Tiny\" Sandford's character in MODERN TIMES rates a name, \"Big Bill\"!) Chaplin Features made after this generally assigned full names to their main characters, e.g., Henri Verdoux-Charlie's name as the main character in MONSIEOUR VERDOUX(1947).So we, of the Post War Baby Boomer crowd were introduced to Mr. Chaplin's work. This was in a big way utilizing a whole season of screening most of his top features,rather than the viewing of an occasional old, butchered up Keystone Short, sans title cards. This was the story on early Television, and mainly on kiddie shows.The release schedule wenta lika thisa: MODERN TIMES(1936), CITY LIGHTS(1931), THE GREAT DICTATOR(1940), MONSIEUR VERDOUX(1947), LIMELIGHT(1952), A KING IN NEW YORK(1957) and the compilation, THE CHAPLIN REVUE(1959)**. After this series was screened, one could be properly classified as an expert in Chapliniana.As a sure sign of change, Chaplin's Signature Ending of Walking Off, Down the Highway of Life, features a companion. The Little Tramp is joined by the Gamin(Paulette Goddard),as an offering of Hope, but forever altering the Chaplin Film.NOTE* The invitation was from the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences. They gave Sir Charles a Special Oscar for Lifetime Service to the moving picture business. It was at the 1972 Oscars seen on ABC. NOTE** The film THE CHAPLIN REVUE(1959) was a fine compilation of 3 of his short subjects from his tenure at First National Pictures. It consists of SHOULDER ARMS(1918), A DOG's LIFE(1918)and THE PILGRIM(1922). Added footage is shown of super sped up construction of Chaplin Studios, mock \"Rehearsing\" for the Camera's benefit and original musical score and crisp narration by Mr. Charles Chaplin, himself!This film is highly recommended as a Chaplin Primer for anyone's initial Chaplin experience.",

However I was determined to see Modern Times because I wanted to see what the fuss was about. At first, I wasn't really impressed because I didn't understand what they were doing. I also found the first few minutes pretty boring. I was wondering, \"I thought he was supposed to be FUNNY.\" I even thought of calling this review that. I was not laughing. I felt that way until he does his hilarious signature walk, twirling around the jail. I was feeling very tired and sick at the time and I burst out laughing. I rewound it and I laughed again. That was a turning point. I was beginning to love Charlie Chaplin. Not only was I amazed by his comic genius, but his physically daring (or what would seem so) stunts. My dad and I were amazed at it! We had to rewind several scenes to try and figure out how it worked. It just worked perfectly. Another person who I was impressed with was Paulette Goddard. Although I think she wouldn't have been a good Scarlett, I think she is stunningly gorgeous in this. She really has a screen presence and I loved her in this. Yet another thing that was so relevant was the political element. Charlie Chaplin hits the nail on the head about the industrial situation in those days. So here I am, reflecting on this wonderful movie. Although it took me a little while to get into it, I am now a very big Charlie Chaplin fan. His modern genius amazes me.

The skit here with the 'nose-powder' leads to Woody Allen's \"Take the Money and Run\" and \"Sleeper\"; the struggle to serve the roast duck was extensively borrowed by John Cleese in \"Fawlty Towers\" (and the hapless 'Manuel' character); the department store robbery was the basis for John Hughes' \"Career Opportunities\". The recently and sadly departed Marcel Marceau drew hugely on Chaplin's mastery of the physical language of silent film.In particular, when Woody affected silly, lecherous behavior (his 'Orgasmatron' skit), he tapped directly into what made Chaplin great -- his ability to simultaneously convey innocence and naughtiness. See how his Tramp attempts to adjust the strategically-placed bolts on women's outfits, and scratch your head as to just how this got past Code restrictions.It seems all the ingredients for greatness are there, the key being the brilliant idea of a 'talkie' vs. 'silent film' construction. But that's all it adds up to: a jumbled collection of ideas that is less than the sum of its parts. It tries to carry a 'message'; it tries to cross pollinate a satire of politics and the dehumanizing power of the industrial state with 'progress' in the form of talking films (all of the vocal parts emanate from machines); it tries to hold together a coherent romance. It's too much to assemble all at one time\u0085I look forward to seeing 'City Lights', and then reconsidering this movie in the context of having seen both",

A foreigner named Charles Chaplin plopped himself down in Hollywood for DECADES (but never took an oath of allegiance to the country which fed and housed him by becoming a U.S. citizen!) and took control of almost everything out there by producing, writing, directing, editing, scoring, and of course starring in a string of salacious flicks. MODERN TIMES indeed! The just mentioned moving picture was his worst assault on American values. Disguised as a \"talkie,\" this throwback silent movie makes fun of the man who enabled modern America, Henry Ford, and his assembly lines. (No one would have a pick-up or an AK-47 today if the workers were like Chaplin's \"tramp\" character in MODERN TIMES, who gets fired from two factories, a boat yard, a department store, and a night club during his first day at each U.S. institution.) Chaplin's tramp snorts cocaine during one of his many prison stints, loafs, defies authority, and leads multiple Communist strikes when he tires of the taxing demands of workplace sabotage. For fun, he gives cigars to young boys and corrupts an under-aged orphan girl. Unlike James Stewart and KING KONG director Merion C. Cooper, Chaplin did NOT become a brigadier general in the U.S.A.F. during WWII. Rather, he became an apologist for Hitler with his MODERN TIMES follow-up, THE GREAT (!!!!!!) DICTATOR. Fortunately for U.S., the next time Chaplin left America our stalwart Legion guys did what was needed to make it illegal for him to set foot on our sacred soil ever again. When President Nixon gave this decadent director a 12-hour furlough to collect an honorary Oscar from his pinko Hollywood cronies, this \"last straw\" resulted in \"Tricy Dick's\" impeachment. He was forced to resign, just as Chaplin was forced to quit making movies at an age when Clint Eastwood was just getting started.",

I mostly am strict about not watching movies released before 1960s since I neither can connect with them nor appreciate the technology used. But this movie baffled me on both fronts dealing with everlasting topics like employee management, changing times, love and hope bundled in beautifully orchestrated scenes like the blindfolded skating, video teleconferencing and automation. Considering the frame rate, scope size, loud background score, this movie didn't put me off as much as I thought it would with a large help from the screen presence of beautiful Paulette Goddard.A Factory Worker (Charlie Chaplin) works in a large manual assembly line and due to his hypnotic work schedule goes into a temporary nervous breakdown causing havoc in the operations. When sent to jail, due to a freak accident and a bizarre incident ends up thwarting an escape plan by fellow prisoners thus building a rapport with the police. With the outside world crumbling in union strikes, unemployment and hunger, the little tramp seems to be making a good life for himself inside the prison walls. When the day finally comes for his release, he makes up his mind to do something to get back to prison which is when he meets a beautiful but down on her luck young girl A Gamin (Paulette Goddard).Chaplin's entire screenplay revolves around coincidences, pure good or bad luck and how he deals with his positive outlook. Though loud, light hearted and in your face on the outset - the power of human spirit, current political satire and hope are always the underlying themes of most of his movies. The perfection of the finished product is easily seen in most of the scenes which actually looked quite technologically superior for its time. Paulette Goddard looked gorgeous and her pleasing presence elevates the likability of the movie. The background score has some melodious tunes but mostly spoiled by the loudness and acoustic nature of the sound available at the time.

In \"Modern Times\", the silent era and The Little Tramp return phoenix-like in arguably their zenith. Long after most talkie films released during this time are considered outdated, this film will be looked upon as an entertaining commentary upon disturbing technological and social trends extending well into the future. Although basically silent, with occasional written inserts, sound is sparingly used, though not in dialogue. Among Chaplin's films, it shares with its talkie successor, \"The Great Dictator\", the distinction of being not just a comedy, but a clear satire on the underbelly of evolving western civilization. In this film, it is the question of whether machines were rapidly becoming the new slaves of men or whether men were becoming the slaves of machines. The inhumanity of working on an assembly line that ever increases in speed is the first target of satire. Lucille Ball would return to this subject in one of her most memorable comedy skits. Henry Ford found that the cure for the astronomical turnover rate of workers on his assembly lines was to pay unheard of wages to his largely immigrant work force. The next target of satire is the invention of mechanical aids that are more trouble and danger than they are worth, or which rob us of our remaining sense of humanity. This is his famous automatic feeding machine comedy scene, one of the most hilarious comedy scenes in the history of film making. Next, Chaplin satirizes the increasing overcomplexity and bodily danger of machines and of life in general. Throughout the film, he mixes routine physical and situational comedy with occasional specialized situations.The Little Tramp is soon fired from every job he lands, whether it's on an assembly line, a construction job, a singing waiter or a mere night watchman. He lands in jail several times, sometimes for his own misdeeds, sometimes for the misdeeds of others. He is a misfit in an age where employees are expected to follow the rules to the letter and to be competent at their tasks. That's why he remains basically a vagrant, at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Each of us knows people who are less extreme versions of The Little Tramp. The Hippies of the later counterculture were rather like Charlie, except they mostly indulged in mind-bending drugs. Like Charlie, they thumbed their noses at the expectations of conventional society, often managing to survive on the throwaways of that society, by sometimes stealing the essentials for living or on occasional odd jobs. In the parting scene, Charlie and his street urchin girl friend(Paulette Goddard) are traveling onward, looking for a way to make their fortune or alternatively for work lives they can live with: something they are competent at, that doesn't maim them or give them a nervous breakdown and that gives them a sense of satisfaction. Most people in western society must travel this road at least once, if not periodically.",

            "content": "MODERN TIMES (United Artists, 1936), was written, produced, scored, directed, and stars Charlie Chaplin in what was to become his final role as the Little Tramp. It also marked the close to the silent screen era. In fact, MODERN TIMES, though not essentially a silent film in a sense, but more like some made between 1927-29 equipped with underscoring, sound effects and talking sequences. While silent movies officially ended by 1929, Chaplin kept that genre going with CITY LIGHTS (1931) and MODERN TIMES, demonstrating that silents is still golden. Chaplin, having come a long way from London music halls to American silent comedies dating back to 1914, not only developed his character but established the greatness in his work. Reportedly in production for two years, possibly more, Chaplin's ability to perfect comedy routines into a simple story like MODERN TIMES is amazing. Supporting Chaplin is Paulette Goddard, an movie extra since 1929, now awarded the opportunity in a major role opposite the comedy legend. Unlike Chaplin's other leading ladies of the past, Goddard is reportedly the only one to become successful, especially during the 1940s following her second pairing in Chaplin's first talkie as THE GREAT DICTATOR (1940).The opening credits super imposed in front of a clock, indicates time as now, while its opening title that reads, \"Modern Times is a story of industry - of individual enterprise - of humanity crusading in pursuit of happiness\" indicates something else, a satire of the machine age, past, present and future, while in fact being one story with two related themes. The first revolves around two people of different backgrounds facing uncertainties with their present lives while the second half turns into a love story between these two same people who have fallen through hard times of the Depression. Before their devotion to one another occurs, their introduction begins with Charlie (Charlie Chaplin), a factory worker of the Electro Steel Corporation where he tightens bolts on moving belts. Unable to adjust to the advanced technology as a tester to a a new type of feeding machine, he acquires a nervous breakdown that has him committed to an asylum for a rest cure. Next introduction is on the Gamin (Paulette Goddard), a waterfront girl whose unemployed father (Stanley Blystone) is killed in a riot, leaving her two younger sisters to be sent to an orphanage while, after escaping from the juvenile officers, struggles to survive in the outside world. Caught stealing a loaf of bread by the law, Charlie, who has since been released from the hospital and struggling himself to find work, comes to her defense admitting he stole it. The lady and the tramp meet again in the patrol wagon that soon breaks down in an accident, leaving these two strangers to make their escape together into the world of uncertainty. Their uncertainty finally turns to hope when a cabaret owner (Henry Bergman) hires the girl to work as a dancer while Charlie is employed as a singing waiter. All's well until the juvenile division track down the girl to have her arrested.For one of Chaplin's most admired films, there's no spoken dialog, at least from Chaplin's standpoint. Talking sequences comes from the factory president (Allan Garcia), who, at one point, yells at Charlie to \"get back to work.\" Other sounds include a radio announcer's voice, police sirens, a barking dog and stomach churning. Chaplin, who preferred to keep his tramp character silent, did offer audiences the opportunity to hear his voice for the first time, in song, for the cabaret sequence, doing some double-talk rendition to \"Titina.\" \u00a0 While MODERN TIMES has become relatively known throughout the years, it was rarely revived until Chaplin's reissued it some time prior to his death in 1977. Having attended the 1980 theatrical revival of MODERN TIMES at the Regency Theater in New York City where it played to a full house, I witnessed patrons, young and old alike, laughing hysterically and watching with amazement at many key scenes being the feeding machine sequence; Charlie roller skating around the department store blindfolded; and his method of feeding lunch to his employer (Chester Conklin) while stuck inside the machine's safety wheels. Considering MODERN TIMES to be not quite so modern by today's standards, it demonstrates how comedy never grows out of style. Acquiring less pathos than CITY LIGHTS, MODERN TIMES is most memorable in the way it bids goodbye to Chaplin's world of silent movie making through its underscoring to the sentimental \"Smile (Though Your Heart is Breaking\"). MODERN TIMES, along with other Chaplin features and short subjects, were distributed on CBS Home Video in 1989 to commemorate Chaplin's centennial year of his birth. Though frequent revivals on various cable channels, ranging from Turner Network Television (1989), American Movie Classics (1991-2001), and Turner Classic Movies (as part of \"The Essentials\") assures how this and many other Chaplin films are to remain in view as long as there are those around to appreciate his art and style the way he originally intended it to be, through laughter and a little tear, especially during these modern times.

            "content": "\"Modern Times\" was made during the Great Depression era (1929-41) and comments on surviving during that time as well as the dehumanizing effects of mass production assembly line techniques just introduced. If Jon Stewart (of USA's TV \"The Daily Show\") had made a movie during that era, maybe this is a much gentler version of what he might have created.World-wide, Chaplin was often called the most famous person alive on the strength of his many previous \"Little Tramp\" shorts and feature silent films. But the modern progress introducing \"talkies\" in 1927 meant the demise of silent films and of those rich techniques Chaplin had honed for communicating without speech. (This film is a hybrid between being a silent film and a talkie.) Also, just previously (the early 1930s), Chaplin had made a couple round the world trips in which he saw the effects of the world-wide depression and assembly lines in many countries. In the USA, some typical factory conditions of that era were described in a recent (April 2011) NPR report: (Google: \"NPR Flint Sit-Down Striker: 'Equal Pay, Equal Conditions' \") Overall, this movie knits together five distinct segments that could be called: factory work; jail time; the night watchman; the waiter; building a life together. The sets for some factory scenes (giant intermeshed gears that swallow and transport people) were astounding; Charlie's waiter scene when he sings made up foreign words while dancing the intended words in pantomime is fantastic; his athleticism and coordination as he skates backwards blindfolded is breathtaking; his anticipation of television monitors is remarkably prescient/ foresighted; and the beauty of Paulette Goddard, (one of his many real-life loves & possibly wives), is striking.The overall message of this film is to find a way to adapt to whatever adversity comes your way and to \"smile.\" Chaplin composed all the music used in the film including the song \"Smile\" and its music and message often recur throughout. (Google: \"Chaplin's 'Smile' Modern Times\" for music & words) (\"MT\" was shown at our monthly \"Great Films at the Cathedral\" series. We saw the Criterion version of \"MT\"; this includes a 2nd disk with several earlier \"Little Tramp\" comedy shorts. Comparing these early slapstick performances with \"MT\" shows how much work Chaplin put in to refining the Little Tramp's silent but so expressive communication with his audience. If you can watch this version, please do--no flicker, dirt, or extraneous noise.)",

            "content": "This is a Chaplin classic; it is funny, touching and has all the hallmarks of Chaplin at his best. However, the film is a hybrid film that is a semi-talkie and a semi-silent film. Chaplin wasn't yet comfortable working entirely in sound but apparently the studio was unwilling to allow him to make a pure silent film ala City Lights. On a technical level the film struggles trying to be of this hybrid form. I wish either the studio or Chaplin got their way entirely on this point. This is a minor quibble.A more pressing problem is the film is a pastiche of the then current social issues of the mid 1930's. The Great Depression, labor unions, police repression of labor strikes, moral panic over communism etc. Etc. All get used as background material. The film's design sensibility is vaguely reminiscent of Lang's Metropolis. This sociopolitical material is not the focus of the film-the storyline is a set of The Tramp's misadventures-but too much of it is included to be mere color. One can feel Chaplin aiming to be more overtly political but is unsure of exactly he is trying to say here. It is distracting from the charms and laughs of the film.This is a work of a gifted artist but one that was always suffering midlife growing pains.",

Chaplin's character is a factory line worker doing speedy and redundant work. Cue tons of physical comedy. Later, he meets the impoverished young woman and they enjoy the slower and simple things in life yet get swept up in the rushed modern society. Chaplin meshes together a touching story of kinship with his stellar well-honed and well-timing physical comedy. This would be Chaplin's final silent film of his famous silent film catalog as the world had moved on. It is a silent film yet incorporates some recorded spoken dialog through radios and machines while still using the traditional title cards; perhaps his hat tip to the future. This is a great film of pure Chaplin style. Also try to tally up how many times he gets arrested. Ha",

Perhaps all the things that are clich\u00e9d to me were new 75 years ago when this movie was released. Even if that is so it doesn't help my opinion of it today. I honestly believe I would have found them clich\u00e9d even in the movie's own age. To think of other similarly released films like Gone With the Wind and then to consider how backward and simple this movie is only underscores how out of place it is in our time. There is only so much hapless buffoon I can take in a movie. This film crossed that threshold and left it in the dust before the first minute had passed. Then there were 87 more of those minutes.The female lead is not as bad as Charlie Chaplin. For what it's worth her physical appearance reminds me a bit of Emily Deschanel of Bones fame. It may be that she is on screen less and thus doesn't wear as thin as Charlie does.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times (1936) is the final film to feature the great actor,director,writer's most easily recognizable incarnation: The Tramp. Here is a character that is so ingrained in the collective conscious of modern film audiences that many recognize him despite the fact that they have not seen a single Chaplin film.Sadly, with the advent of synchronized sound and dialogue, the world of silent film making began to slip into obscurity with audiences and studios now viewing it as obsolete and undesirable. Nevertheless, Chaplin continued his passion for the subtle craft by creating City Lights (1931), which many critics and academics consider one of the greatest films ever made, but by the time Modern Times was released, Chaplin was one of the last directors left clinging to a dying art.Timeless Charlie Chaplin satire savagely critiques the industrial age and its dehumanizing effects on the working class. After his monotonous assembly line job leads to a stay in a mental asylum, Chaplin is released and encounters lovely hobo Paulette Goddard. Soon, his desire to make a better life for his new love leads to a side-splitting series of failed jobs and prison stays.Modern Times is also one of the most stirring love stories ever put on film. The only character who is on the same level as The Tramp is a young, homeless woman who is referred to as \"The Gamin\" and is played by Chaplin's then-wife, Paulette Goddard. These two are brought together by the fact they have almost nothing except the will to live and continue forward, despite adversity. Both are nameless, neither has a home, and they each have no money or material possessions.Final shot is among Chaplin's most famous and most moving. The final image of Modern Times refuses to let the film end on an exclusively tragic note and demonstrates that the individual is still alive and may yet find his way in an ever-changing world. 10/10The Chaplin-Goddard Marriage: Was It Legal?Charlie Chaplin. Famous for his tumultuous early marriages, his third \"marriage\" to actress Paulette Goddard has been the source of much scrutiny and doubt. Some say the issue even cost Goddard the role of Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With The Wind.The pair met in 1932, when Goddard was still a chorus girl, and became fast friends and lovers, Paulette even moving into Chaplin's Beverly Hills home. He bought her contract from producer Hal Roach and cast her in his classic Modern Times, which took two years to develop and film. After the release of Modern Times in 1936 the couple went on a tour of the Orient where they supposedly married secretly aboard ship. However, no official paperwork was ever provided to substantiate the claim which had the potential to further harm Paulette Goddard's career. They went on to co-star in Chaplin's next film, The Great Dictator, but the relationship began to fizzle. When the two decided to part ways in 1942, Goddard obtained a quickie divorce in Mexico and allegedly received a handsome settlement.Goddard went on to become a major star at Paramount and Chaplin (after a nasty paternity suit) married his final wife, Oona O'Neill in 1943.",

His Tramp's constant attempt to find comfort in any way possible (even institutionalizing himself) along with the plight of the orphan girl is yet another example of his perfect handle on comedic drama and how to make people laugh while feeling really depressed at the same time.This movie was made in 1936, long after sound had taken over cinema, and beyond just being a satire of industry and \"modern times\", it's a farewell of sorts to the Tramp proper. People wanted to know what the Tramp sounded like, and Chaplin knew that his character didn't work in sound, so even though this was made late, it's still silent... except for sound added in primarily to create a feeling of abuse.A few things are turned around this time. Instead of trying to get the girl, the girl gets along quite fine staying with him. But what's most interesting, especially to Chaplin fans, is the finally where the Tramp \"sings.\" Finally the image of sound as oppression is discarded, the Tramp learns to be vocal, everyone loves him and thinks he's brilliant, yet still the world oppresses and he's forced to walk away with the promise that \"We'll manage.\" And we never see the Tramp again.It is quite a powerful film (even while it splits your sides with laughter) and definitely one of his best.--PolarisDiB",

It was one that I knew I've eventually check out again with a critical eye. I finally did as it is on the Internet Database Movie Poster that Jaime and I are working through. I jumped on watching this when she begrudgingly agreed since I kept making jokes about how we could watch it.We start this off with a factory worker, Charles Chaplin, as he creates issues. This gets to the point where a protest breaks out and the factory is closed. It leaves him out of work. Chaplin gets arrested when a brick is accidently thrown at a cop. He goes back a few other times, including when he ends up marching with a group of communists. He is released when he thwarts a prison breakout while on cocaine.There is another story that joins up with his where a gamin, Paulette Goddard, is left an orphan. Her mother is deceased and her father is killed by accident. Her siblings are taken in by the state, but she flees. When she meets Chaplin, the two of them decide to start a life together. Things aren't easy though and everyone is out to stop them.Now I'm sure when I watched this in class, I was taught about the social commentary. This came out and is set during the Great Depression. Work is hard to come by and the capitalist people who run the factory as well as other businesses are just looking for mindless workers. Chaplin's character doesn't fit. He is bumbling which cause stoppages and damages machinery. There is a great scene where he gets sucked into one of them and we see that him, as well as the other workers, are just a cog in the greater economy.This movie makes this message easy to take with the slapstick comedy that Chaplin is known for. Jaime wasn't impressed, but I laughed quite a few times. He is just a master of what he does. From his look in the oversized clothes that he wears and make him look like a tramp. To his innocent smile and his distinct mustache. We even get to hear him sing at the climax of this movie as well. To compliment him, there is Goddard who is cute. They're doing what they can to make it, but the world isn't helping.All that is left to say is that this is well-made. There is a scene in the department store that gives me anxiety. The cinematography is fine. The settings and effects are basic, but they are effective for what they need. Other than that, I'd say that the soundtrack fit for what was needed. What is amazing is that the commentary is still relevant today. I can't recommend this to everyone, but if you like older films like this. I would say give this a watch as it is a classic.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10.",

Despite the weighty deeper implications, it remains a genuinely charming set of skits and Chaplin is at his emotive, expressive best from curtain to curtain.

            "content": "\"Buck up - never say die. We'll get along.\"I can't think of a more fitting line than that final one from the Tramp to the Gamin to say farewell to silent films as they cheerfully walk towards the horizon. By 1936 everyone was watching talkies and they expected Modern Times to be Chaplin's first one considering his previous film, City Lights, had already incorporated some sound effects five years ago. Modern Times is considered one of Chaplin's finest movies and perhaps a lot of it has to do with the fact that it was his last silent film so it has the nostalgic factor going for it. The way Chaplin incorporates sound in Modern Times is pure genius because the only moments where we hear sound is when they come from mechanical devices, so in a way he blended the social critique of the Industrial age with his own critique of the use of sound in film. This mechanical monster that was taking over his industry was putting an end to the silent era which made him such a popular figure. Chaplin may have stated that his films aren't social critiques, but I don't think anyone managed to capture the human spirit during that era better than he did. During the first hour of this film which I earnestly enjoyed I couldn't quite understand why this film was considered superior to his other films which I enjoyed more. Up to that moment there wasn't really a scene that stood out for me like there had been in all his other features. Then suddenly when I was about to lose hope came the restaurant scene where the Tramp performs a song where we can't understand what he's saying, but through his gestures he makes himself perfectly understood. That was the scene that sold this movie for me and reminded me of Chaplin's genius. The ending in Modern Times is perhaps my favorite ending in all of Chaplin's films, although I still think I would rank City Lights as his best film. In his last silent film Charles Chaplin stars as the Tramp once again, and this time we find him working at an assembly line in a factory. The quick working pace and the mechanized movements he has to make slowly begin to affect him. He can't keep up with the pace in the assembly line and production is delayed because of him. During a lunch break he is chosen for experimentation with an automatic feeding machine that they want to sell to the president of the steel corporation. The machine goes haywire and the Tramp also begins to lose his sanity so he is sent to a mental hospital. Eventually he is released but after an unfortunate incident he is mistaken for a communist and imprisoned. In prison he becomes a hero by stopping several prisoners from breaking out of jail so he is released. Unemployed and unable to find a job all he wants is to go back to prison, but when he meets a Gamin (Paulette Goddard) and falls in love with her, he makes it his goal to find a job and buy a house where the two can live happily ever after, but in these modern times it won't be an easy task.Charlie Chaplin and Paulette Goddard have excellent chemistry together although the film is a little too sentimental at times. In Modern Times, Chaplin manages to once again balance pathos with slapstick, but I found some of the scenarios to be a little too similar to his other films so I felt it was getting a bit repetitive. However, what Chaplin does really well here is include the social elements of the time and use it to his advantage by focusing on the struggle the people had adapting to the modern industrial age. He does this by using satire through his brilliant physical comedy. In an era of dehumanization, Chaplin humanizes Modern Times with a sweet and tender story reminding everyone that the obstacles can be overcome. With every new problem that the Tramp has to face somehow he always finds a way to remain hopeful and rise to the occasion. That is perhaps why his comedies still remain timeless and continues to touch the hearts of those who encounter Chaplin for the first time. They will also understand that dialogue was not always necessary to tell a story, and the best to do so was Chaplin with his unique energy and brilliance.",

            "review_title": "Chaplin making a silent movie in a talkies world",
            "content": "With \"Modern times\" (1936) Charlie Chaplin took a considerable risk. During his previous film \"City lights\" (1931) talkies were on the rise, but in 1936 talkies were very much the standard. Silent movies were dead. Chaplin however believed in the strength of pantomime and had the opinion that dialogue would weaken this strength. For \"Modern times\" he made the decision to incorporate sound effects but not dialogue (but intertitles!). This is most manifest in the end when the little tramp (in his last film) sings a song in a sort of esperanto language. For Chaplin the tramp was an international figure and he hated to destroy that image by making the tramp talking English. His next film (\"The great dictator\", 1940) contained dialogue but did not cantain the little tramp anymore.Not only with respect to sound but also with respect to his political engagement took Chaplin a mixed decision in \"Modern times\". It is clear that Chaplin is critical about mechanisation and subordinating men to machine. This message is however wrapped up in a film full of slapstick moments. In \"The great dictator\" Chaplins political views became more prominent and his leftist image would cause him problems in the USA.\"Modern times\" is often compared to \"A nous la libert\u00e9\" (1931, Rene Clair). Some people were of the opinion that \"Modern times\" was on the verge of plagiarism. It is undeniable that there are similarities (for example assembly lines going too fast, lunch hour in the factory getting out of hand). In \"A nous la libert\u00e9\" Rene Clair compares factory workers with inmates. In \"Modern times\" Chaplin compares them with a flock of sheep.There are however also differences. \"A nous la libert\u00e9\" is during the whole film faithfulll to his theme that liberty is incompatible with the way labour is organised in a modern economy. In \"Modern times\" this theme is mostly visible in the beginning of the film. Thereafter the film is a series of loose slapsticks according to the principle of 12 jobs, 13 accidents. Maybe Chaplin didn't want to make the film too political. Maybe this latter part of the film reflects the economic crisis after the stockmarket crash of 1929 and the massive unemployment that came with this crisis. According to the last hypothesis we should not compare the second part of \"Modern times\" with \"A nous la libert\u00e9\" but see it as a comical version of \"The grapes of wrath\" (940, John Ford).\"A nous la libert\u00e9\" ends with two friends walking a lonely country road. \"Modern times\" ends with the little tramp walking on such a road. He walks away from the movieviewers, never to come back again. Fortunately he doesn't walk alone, but with the love of his live (the gamin played by Paulette Goddard).",

On the surface, it's a black & white feature with scarce dialogue & cheap slapstick humor. I personally don't like slapstick comedy, but I realize that was Chaplin's forte. Besides, coming out of the silent film era, films had very little else to do for humor. Imagine a mute stand-up comedian (amen)!However, there's a second level. The opening title shot establishes that this film concerns the American dream. The next shots show a mass of herded sheep, then a mass of herded people on the street. Later, Chaplin's boss observes an automatic feeder meant to eliminate a worker's lunch hour; this demonstrates the drive for inhuman efficiency. Then, Chaplin meets the gamin, and they dream of a life together; Chaplin describes a dream home to Goddard's character. The film contrasts the ideal with their soon-acquired home, little better than a barn with a lean-to shed. This is a classic example of Chaplin's struggling common man in a time much larger than himself. I could go on, but it's 12:30 AM...Chaplin's ingenuity lay in the fact that he could convey a stark message while simultaneously providing cheap laughs/entertainment. Directors such as Michael Moore fail in that respect; I found Fahrenheit 911 alternating between thought-provoking and ridiculous, but unceasingly difficult to sit through. Perhaps somebody should have written an entertaining drama or satire about an inept president named after some piece of vegetation...well, you get the idea.

As well as a perfect example of the absurdly meticulous care Chaplin invested in his film-making process and enormous risks he took for his art, the sequence proves allegorical for the film as a whole: breathtaking, dazzlingly beautiful, hilarious and yet always on the brink of a fatal crash, each time veering away at the last moment. Considering all the factors against, it remains astounding that Modern Times works as a film - an almost entirely silent film released several years after talking pictures had permeated the film industry which also proved a daring social critique masked as a silly slapstick comedy. Yet despite what a difficult sell such a film must have been, Chaplin's frantic energy, confidence and eternal courage instead elevate the film into a monumental accomplishment, simultaneously challenging and enormously entertaining, decades ahead of its time, as its ironic title would suggest. Of course, as such it inevitably proved a box office failure, with audiences uneasy about a film seeming to rally communist support for striking workers (an interpretation Chaplin wryly mocks in a sequence where the Tramp is jailed for accidentally leading a worker's revolt), but such an initial failure only served to demonstrate how innovative Modern Times was and remains. For a film appearing to be loosely structured around a series of sight gags, it is easy to mistake the remarkable complexity inherent in Chaplin's masterpiece. The seamless integration of barbed satire of authority and social commentary on poverty into Chaplin's hysterical slapstick were hard worn cinematic traits of his by now, but his critique on the dehumanizing monotony of industrialization and factory work is what generates the real spark, providing a whole new setting for Chaplin's irreverent tramp to wreak havoc and expose the inherent problems of (one particularly witty situation sees the workers, chasing the tramp magnetically dash back to their assembly lines as soon as the lines are turned back on). But every time the depiction of rising poverty and unemployment rates grows too sombre, Chaplin veers the film emotionally off into the opposite direction, perfectly counterbalancing such sobering undertones with astonishing acrobatics, inspired silliness and an ever infectious cheeriness, even in the face of increasing adversity. While poverty may not be entirely avoidable, Chaplin seems to imply, everlasting persistence and optimism are often the best one can do - a potentially overly saccharine message, but from a film which produces such genuine, unfiltered movie magic (the aforementioned roller-skating scene being only one of countless examples) it is difficult to imagine a more fitting culmination.The fanatical dedication of Chaplin pervades every aspect of the production (most of which he personally toiled on) from his subtle but rock steady direction and perfect pacing, to his wonderfully resonant musical score to his usual knack for ingenious setting choices, firmly imbedding the viewer in both unsettlingly realistic dank, dirty depression era streets and one of the worst imaginable industrial black holes. Chaplin's factory setting is a fascinating, albeit grim cinematic marvel, both fantastic and frighteningly real, with horrific machinery no doubt inspired by Fritz Lang's dystopian Metropolis, but serving instead as an unconventional playground, with the nightmarish turning cogs and spewing bouts of steam making for some of the film's best sight gags. Of course to downplay the performance of Chaplin himself would be an unpardonable offence, as the last outing of the delightful Tramp proves arguably one of his most rounded performances. As the tramp is continually hard done by, struggling to survive in an impoverished, industrial nightmare of a world, the everlasting twinkle in his eye and bumbling gait make such a journey a hilariously enjoyable and poignant one instead of a melodramatically downbeat one. Ever hysterical and brimming with cheery pathos, Chaplin's tramp is as much a joy to behold as always, his final appearance truly one for the ages (fittingly enough, his 'last words' are \"C'mon - smile!\"). Backing up the irresistible dynamo of a lead, Paulette Goddard brings a rawly determined vulnerability and feisty charm to her impoverished female lead, making her infinitely more compelling and likable than the usual starry eyed love interest role. Easily one of his very best (if not singularly best) pieces of work, Chaplin's Modern Times is a masterpiece of film-making, a pinnacle of cinematic comedy and an exuberantly emotional triumph, perfectly blending an underbelly of dark satire and social commentary with irreverent silliness and wit. It is impossible to imagine a more fitting or all around majestic swan song to the tramp's legacy, instantly worth seeing for any viewers unfortunate enough to have not yet experienced it. -10/10",

            "content": "If you are among the audiences who have heard some points about the story but do not know how it will be told, you will most probably hope to watch a political and social film which talks in a 'political' way, to not to touch and disturb anybody else, especially anyone with a political and social power. As an accustomed cinema audience, who never expects a Hollywood film to tell about real life, I had prejudices about Modern Times before watching it. But all my prejudices have cleared out with an unexpected astonishment in the first scene of the film: a flock of sheep moving ahead with a strong and obvious oblivion compared to a huge group of labor at a rush hour peak. There could not be a more honest and brave way of explaining such a message: if the modernity, technology and the ambition for more money, that is 'Modern Times' turn the people into industrialized, standard and identical creatures, and make them forget their humanity; the society that they constitute will not be a society, but a herd. Just for this first scene, I can claim that there can hardly be such a film, which knows and explains what it wants to say without any fear of all the world powers watching.First of all, we watch the Modern Times through the life of Charlie Chaplin as the Little Tramp who works in a factory assembly line and the gamine who is terribly poor and has to live in the streets. Between these two, the audience cannot decide which one to have pity for: Tramp is in a better condition compared to the gamine; at least he earns money and has clothes to wear on. The gamine seems to be in a terrible condition with her bare feet and dirty face. On the other hand, she has something that Tramp does not have: her own willpower that she can use to choose what she wants to live. In contrast, Tramp even does not have a chance to go to toilet comfortably, because he is seen as a machine- a part of the assembly line he is working - by the system, and a machine can not go to even a toilet. The system, or the Big Brother as the icon of the system in the film, believe that making the production more effective goes on the way of turning the labor into machines. In his opinion, effectiveness of production only means 'producing as fast as possible'. You can increase the speed of a machine by using its buttons, but what about labor? At this point, the Big Boss chooses to see and behave the labor as machines. The way he gives his orders not physically but through the technology- those big screens and especially in the scene of the feeding machine, we can clearly see the mistake of the system about the labor class: working 'with' the machines does not make them machines.With the fact that Modern Times was shot nine years after the speaking films have started, it becomes even more interesting to see that Little Tramp still does not talk. We cannot say that this film is a totally silent film, because we hear voices and some specific people talking. But these specific people are the ones who have social status and power. Just as in the real life, we can hear only the powerful people of the capitalist system in the film. This is a genius contrast, because this film was made to be the voice of the people- the labor, the poor, the gamine - who do not have the chance to talk in real life as much as the boss, the rich- people who belong to the upper levels of society due to their monetary power. On the other hand, they still cannot talk even in this film, which is their voice. By this way, the Modern Times becomes the 'quiet scream' of those people, which makes this film even more dramatic and stronger. Another contrast is that when we hear the voices of those specific characters, such as the Big Boss and the feeding machine company, we do not directly hear them talking. Their voices come to us through an artificial tool, such as the big screens, the loudspeakers and the radio. As the age of technology, this is another criticism made to Modern Times. With all those tools that are named as technology, Modern Times kills our humanity. It becomes a barrier in front of us that hinders our communication and empathy. That is why the bosses start to see their labors as machines. That is a trick that Modern Times has made us since the day it was born: to kill the consciousness of being a human.To conclude, the movie Modern Times will certainly have its place in the cinema history, as one of the most brave and honest films, which warn the humanity against the danger of 'Modern Times' turning into 'Mean Times', that may bring unconscious, standardized societies full with people who have turned into easily controllable sheep.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin's Modern Times is a wonderful little film. It is in effect a series of shorts strung together and connected by the two leads, Chaplin's tramp and Paulette Goddard's gamin. The tale is about how the machine age has taken over industry, throwing men on the streets with no jobs or money to keep their families afloat. In a brilliant stroke of ingenuity, Chaplin decides to scrap the idea of making this a \"talkie\" and allows only machines to have a voice. For instance, if the boss needs to bark orders, he does so through a TV screen and if Mr. Billows needs to explain how his feeding machine works, he plays a record containing his full speech. The sound effects are great and the visuals stunning, especially while at the factory. What its essentially a silent film at its core, Modern Times is so much more. A commentary on technology and the dream of making a home for the ones you love, it is also a very sharp comedy that will have you laughing throughout with its physical gags.During the course of his travels, Chaplin's tramp gets mixed up in some impressive set-piece jokes. From the assembly line shenanigans, to the giant gear trappings, to the feeding machine, inadvertently leading a Communist march, a couple stints in jail, a department store disaster, a dilapidated house, and the struggles of waiting tables, he always finds a way to get out of trouble. With all these things happening, the film can appear a tad disjointed, but as his character continues to evolve and the title-cards give us elapsed time, it still holds together as a complete story. A king of physical laughs, Chaplin never holds back either. His nervous breakdown at the plant shows his dedication to the comedy by being unable to shake the arm motion of his job even when he is outdoors and, of course, the rollerskating stunt later on is impressive. I'd be interested to see how that was shot, either composed post-filming to add the drop, or if he really was that close to the edge.You can't deny the man's gift as an artist. How each vignette plays out is inventive and humorous on its journey. Even the moments with the beautiful Goddard are funny in their own right. Her manic facial expressions and piratelike mannerisms while stealing bananas on the docks during her introduction bring some good laughs. Her character is used pretty much as a straightman to Chaplin's lunatic, but she plays the part well. The dream sequence of the two living in a nice house with fruit hanging at every window is priceless and the final scene at the restaurant is a riot. With her trying to help him out in getting a steady job and him mucking it all up to end up needing to sing in gibberish, it is the best part of the movie.While I feel people of all ages can appreciate the film on its own merits\u0097the comedy is broad and kids will enjoy the stunts and bodily harm stuff\u0097it does contain some adult situations. Besides the Communist march mentioned previously, there is a short scene with Chaplin drunk along with a more lengthy part with him after imbibing some \"nose powder.\" It is never actually labeled as being drugs and the scene could be effective still without knowing what the powder is, so one should not use it as the sole reason to not show it to children. Modern Times is a classic on many levels and has proved so by standing the test of time for seventy years thus far.",

            "content": "Following the release of City Lights, Chaplin met with several world leaders as he toured the world for eighteen months. Chaplin formulated ideas for his next film during this tour while the United States was caught in the grip of The Great Depression. It was the wave of automation in the industrial economy which peaked Chaplin's interest. His visit to the auto and industrial factories in Detroit served as the basis for his opening scenes of Modern Times. Chaplin preventing his co-workers from chasing him by throwing the conveyor belt switch makes a huge visual statement which correlates with Chaplin's views of workers' lives being controlled by economic oppression. Chaplin, the artist unencumbered by daily life, views individuals in The Great Depression (literally) as cogs, in one late scene, in the industrial machine, left behind or replaced at will due to a changing economy. In Modern Times, Chaplin plays the tramp for the final time with his latest female prot\u00e9g\u00e9: Paulette Goddard stars in her first featured role as the gamin. Chaplin again combines all the known trademarks of his craft into an immensely entertaining experience: Acrobatics and athleticism, allusions to previous films, crisp cinematography, great editing, pantomime, perfect comic timing, sight gags, social commentary, and some pathos. The combination is nearly perfect in a film which often feels not like a feature film but like a series of short films strung together. Several scenarios feature delightful changes in plot and setting, mirroring the necessity for the everyman to adapt to the changing world around him (although not always understanding it or being successful). The tramp is cast as an everyman trying to balance his penchant for protecting pretty girls with maintaining a job in spite of his inability to gel as one of the crowd in the industrial environment. The tramp works in an electric company factory, in a shipyard ever so briefly, as a floorwalker at night in a department store, and again in the factory as an assistant to a mechanic. In between, he spends a few stretches in the hoosegow. He defends the gamin, who tries stealing bread from a storefront. Bit by bit, the tramp and the gamin join forces and realize it's more hopeful trying to make it together in life than by oneself.Chaplin wrote, produced, and directed the film with a keen awareness of American society at the time. The film was released during the height of The Great Depression in 1936, and many aspects of the film speak to that, including the common themes of sticking together under trying circumstances and worker oppression. This is the second film which Chaplin composed the music for at the time of a film's original release. The song \"Smile\" can be heard multiple times during the film, has been used over and over many times since, and has become a standard in the cannon of great American songs.Highlights of the film include the factory scenes, reminiscent of both Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Rene Clair's A Nous La Liberte a few years before. Modern Times created a controversy between the makers of A Nous La Liberte and Chaplin, taking many years to resolve. The scene where Chaplin inadvertently leads a mob of protesters turned bitterly ironic when over fifteen years later, it was used against Chaplin by those accusing him of having communist and socialist leanings. Chaplin paid for it, informally forced into exile to Europe from which he returned only briefly to receive a special Oscar in 1972. The automation scenes, while highly exaggerated for 1936, turned out to be not so far-fetched in the end. Today we can see this in everyday life, like self serve pumps and checkouts, and not just behind the scenes in factories and businesses. The prison scene serves as a visual metaphor for the working man enveloped by the industrial economy; success may be just as much a result of fate or luck as hard work, just like the reasons for his arrest and eventual release from prison. As the night floorwalker, Chaplin recalls his two earlier films The Floorwalker and The Rink, displaying his extraordinary athleticism on the escalator and with the roller skates.Chaplin sings off the cuff (literally) as a singing waiter in a commentary about sound in films, echoing the public speeches at the beginning of City Lights. Chaplin has always relied on charm, facial expressions, gesticulations, and personality in films. In Modern Times, his message is clear that sound is as intrusive in film as the mundane requirements of the working world are in the lives of us all. He wisely chose to leave sound confined to the music he composed for the soundtrack and the factory's hierarchical communications filtered by mechanical means; an example of this is the big boss looking over the tramp's shoulder in the bathroom from the monitor, berating the tramp to return to work. The big boss also bears more than a passing resemblance to industrial giant Henry Ford. The film ends with one of the most recognizably upbeat scenes in American film history. Chaplin regular, Henry Bergman, makes his last film appearance as the caf\u00e9 proprietor near the end. Chester Conklin plays the factory's mechanic. **** of 4 stars.",

            "content": "The arrival of sound to films in 1927 (in the movie \"The Jazz Singer\") was definitely a major turning point in history of cinema, and one that would have enormous consequences in the motion picture industry of those years. Only 2 years after \"The Jazz Singer\" was released, sound films (\"talkies\") became the dominant format in cinema, and slowly the silent era reached its end and with it the careers of those who couldn't make the transition. Of course, sound faced harsh opposition from many prominent artists of silent movies like directors Sergei Eisenstein and Charlie Chaplin, who felt that sound diminished the art of cinema instead of elevating it. Soon, both directors would find themselves forced to get with the times and make the transition, but Chaplin wouldn't quit without a last laugh. 1936's silent movie \"Modern Times\" would be Chaplin's sweet farewell to his beloved silent era, and with it, to his most famous character: the Tramp.\"Modern Times\" is the story of a factory worker (Chaplin as the Tramp), who works at an assembly line in an enormous industrial facility. The constant overworking begins to take its toll in him and suffers a mental breakdown that sends him to the hospital. After his recovery, he discovers that he is no longer an employee, as the workers are on a strike, and are now marching towards the factory. By a weird series of circumstances, the Tramp is arrested after being confused with a Communist leader, and sent to jail where he spends literally the best time of his life. After being released for good behavior, he finds himself again jobless and on a very difficult condition, so he plans to return to jail as soon as possible; however, his plans will change after he meets an orphan girl gamine (Paulette Goddard), who is living in a harshest condition than his.As usual, \"Modern Times\" was not only a movie directed by Chaplin, but also written and produced by himself; and once again he returns to his familiar mix of drama and comedy that he had been perfect over the years with monumental classics like \"The Gold Rush\" and \"City Lights\". This time however, Chaplin takes a more politically charged approach and fills his comedy with his ideas about the harsh life of factory workers, dehumanization, and the Great Depression. While this often unsubtle use of comedy as an outlet for his ideologies could had been damaging for the story in other writer's hands, Chaplin creates a joyfully optimist and very humanist plot that helps to make easier to enjoy and understand the overtly political tone of the film. The story is written in an episodic form, but it flows with nicely thanks to its nonstop series of excellent gags that keep the fun coming.Visually, the movie is probably Chaplin's greatest artistic achievement, as he extends the themes of his screenplay to the overall look of the film. With a clever use of montage (obviously inspired by Soviet filmmakers) and several nods to German expressionism, Chaplin brings to life his vision of society slowly transforming into a industrialized monster where there is hardly any place for love and happiness. The excellent art direction by Charles D. Hall and J. Russell Spencer is an essential piece for this and it's definitely a highlight of the film, as it truly makes \"Modern Times\" feel \"modern\". While for the most part Chaplin manages to keep a good balance between the drama and the comedy of the film, he can't help but fall on excessive sentimentalism, making the film feel a bit too preachy at times.The main cast, as in every Chaplin movie, is remarkable in their performances, and each one of them truly add a lot of their personalities to their roles. As his most famous character, the Tramp, Chaplin here is pure gold and as always, he fills the screen with his charming presence and enormous comedic talent. His body control shines in several scenes of slapstick comedy that are nowadays classics, and he also shows off his total domain of pantomime as he easily transmits the audience that joyful optimism that has become the Tramp's trademark. As the Tramp's counterpart, Paulette Goddard is simply beautiful, displaying a natural charm and freshness that makes her character the Tramp's best sidekick since Jackie Coogan in \"The Kid\".While this movie was supposed to be Chaplin's first \"talkie\", he quickly dismissed the idea as he considered that his Tramp character worked better without speaking; so with this in mind the legendary comedian decided to transform \"Modern Times\" into a hybrid: a \"talkie\" in the silent era style, where every sound in the film is audible except the human voice. In fact, the only spoken voices that become audible are the ones that come out of machines (radio for example), keeping in touch with the script's themes of humanity trapped by the modern industrial nightmare. This could also be seen as Chaplin making fun of \"talkies\", as while technically he shot a movie with sound, he faithfully followed classic conventions of the silent era like title cards and specially, the pantomime style of acting.\"Modern Times\" is without a doubt one of Chaplin's best films, and one of the most interesting comedies of all time. While it kind of lacks that naivet\u00e9 that made \"The Gold Rush\" such an amazing experience, it offers a new and more sophisticated style of comedy. As the last movie of the silent era and the Tramp's final on-screen apparition, \"Modern Times\" is a timeless classic that even today helps us to remind that despite the advent of the modernization, there's still place for happiness, as in the Tramp's words, \"Buck up - never say die, We'll get along.\" 9/10",

            "content": "MILD SPOILERS!Though far from perfect, \"Modern Times\" is a quintessential movie.  Chaplin knew that movies were called MOVE-ees because they were a celebration of kinesis, that is, movement.  In fact, according to Chaplin, only fights and chases were \"pure cinema\".  Fortunately, his actual practice was less adamant than his rhetoric.  \"Modern Times\" is pure cinema to be sure but in a broader sense than Charlie would've defined it.  Though not always humorous (sometimes even when it's trying to be), \"Modern Times\" has some genuinely funny moments.  I love The Tramp's morning swim in his new pond.  Smartly outfitted, and spry of step, The Tramp skips out of the changing room, down the path, and to the end of the diving platform. Then, with prowess and aptitude, he dives...into about 2 inches of water! Of course, there are several delightful moments like this and, like so many of Chaplin's scenes, they are the stuff of legend.  In addition to humor, there are some dazzlingly tense moments.  As The Tramp is pulled through the gears of the machine you catch yourself saying, \"That can't be safe, can it?\"  And, of course, the blind-folded rollerskating scene is as good as anything in \"The Matrix\" (and no CGI either). \nFinally, in my opinion, (don't know about Charlie's) my point of entry into the movie was due to its pathos.  I liked the relationship between The Tramp and The Gamin (wharf-child).  Paulette Goddard is a strikingly attractive woman (with an eerie resemblance to Molly Shannon) and their relationship is touching and innocent.  As those first strains of \"Smile\" faded in, I knew that they had me.  To me, this is just as much pure cinema as the rest.       A second definition of kinesis illuminates what could be considered the flat side of the movie.  Kinesis is also defined as a movement that lacks directional orientation and depends upon the intensity of stimulation.  This is a pretty accurate description of large sections of \"Modern Times\".  Like many of the early Disney shorts, it suffers somewhat from a manic, unpredictable plot.  Until the middle section, \"Modern Times\" is little more than a series of gags.  Of course, this was probably quite intentional and Chaplin could've done whatever he wanted.  Nevertheless, I do think it holds the film back from perfection.  Finally, (and, for some reason, this almost completely stops at the half-way point) repetition of gags has a way of subduing some of the humor.  There CAN be too much of a good thing.Chaplin's Tramp, especially in \"Modern Times\" reminds me of two fictional creations, both on radically opposite ends of the spectrum.  While I'm not the first to observe this, as an inveterate Disney fan, I couldn't help but notice the similarity between The Tramp and \"The Mick\", Micky Mouse.  Like, Mickey, The Tramp is simple, uncomplicated, good (without being too good), resilient, and indomitable.  It's clear that Chaplin had a large influence on this little mouse and (seen accordingly) Chaplin's influence on cinema (and the world) is immeasurable.  Finally, and I just thought of this, The Tramp is a modern version of the mythical Sisyphus (especially as portrayed by Camus in his essay, \"The Myth of Sisyphus\").  Sisyphus was the guy who (due to his impertinence) was forever cursed to push up a mountain a boulder which refused to stay put. Camus sees all of us as toiling in equally grueling and fruitless fashion and yet sees something admirable in Sisyphus.  Though he never seems to get it right (like The Tramp), he refuses to quit.  Camus says that he imagines Sisyphus happy.  I have seen with my own eyes that The Tramp IS happy.  In a final act of blind un-reasoning optimism, The Tramp and his girl-friend walk away into the sunset in search of new ventures (and adventures). Their chosen path is right down the middle of an empty highway (desolate and empty as well as a blank canvas of hope).  Their faces are turned to the future and, therefore hidden to us, but we KNOW that they are smiling.",

            "content": "This is now the fourth Chaplin film I've watched in succession. I'm aware that I'm going with the favourites in The Kid, The Gold Rush and City Lights, but still what a career. He's The Tramp again here, this time struggling to keep up with a modern world that's speeding up around him. It strikes me that although on the surface we think of The Tramp as the lovable fool. Where Chaplin excels is placing him in worlds that the audience recognise and can emphasise with. How would Chaplin back in 1936 imagine these films being enjoyed nearly a century later. Sure our connection to the changing world of the 30s isn't really there, but I think in 2022 we can all still empathise with things changing around us without our control. The Tramp is a factory worker, thrust into a world of machines, electricity, productivity. He seems ill suited. The Tramp appreciates life, his calm polite energy at odds with this steel and chrome environment. He's certainly at odds with his boss, the president of the factory (Al Ernest Garcia), who was also the millionaire's butler in City Lights. He wants everything yesterday. Why let workers stop for lunch, when you can get a machine to feed them faster while still on the job! The Tramp, always the genuine pig expertly shows why some things are best done old school. This feels like a much more physical performance, as The Tramp loses his marbles in the industrial frenzy, literally caught in the machine. The camera moves more too though, giving this a phrenetic pace. Until it all becomes too much and The Tramp looks for a life without excitement. Without any effort though, excitement always finds him. Mistaken as a communist leader, accidentally getting high on Coke whist banged up, thwarting prison breaks. It's not short on drama. As is often the case with Chaplin films though, the heart of it is people. Here his understanding that modernisation isn't working well for everyone. Machines are taking jobs and the mass unemployed are being left behind. The Tramp's affable nature puts him in situations that aren't just funny, but allow him the chance to help those around him. He can't help it. He's looking out for himself too, but is just inherently programmed to do the right thing, even when it's the wrong thing. The score, also by Chaplin as well as writing and directing is great. He understands the rhythm of the story, how each scene moves things along and how the music brings the emotion and voices to the silent characters on screen. The Tramp finds himself a partner in crime with a young homeless woman (Paulette Goddard), who's an interesting character in herself. She's not the stereotype of the usual female roles of the era. Shoeless and slightly bedraggled she has a wonderful unencumbered freedom to her performance and she compliments Chaplin perfectly as they dream of a different life in a department store after hours. They're a sweet pair, happy in their version of domesticity, but the call of work is never far away, as is The Tramp's ability to find the humour in every situation. Like helping a trapped coworker with his lunch by funnelling tea into his mouth through a chicken, brilliant! Will he find a steady job though and will The Tramp and his partner's checkered past catch up with them? It's certainly the busiest looking Chaplin film I've seen so far, but he never loses sight of the importance of character, of story arc, of keeping an audience on its toes and doing it with a delightful sense of purity.",

Chaplin's foreword to his picture was dangerously meaningful. \"'Modern Times,'\" it reads, \"is a story of industry, of individual enterprise\u2014humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness.\" We should prefer to describe \"Modern Times\" as the story of the little clown, temporarily caught up in the cogs of an industry geared to mass production, spun through a three-ring circus and out into a world as remote from industrial and class problems as a comedy can make it.With \"Modern Times,\" a fable about (among other things) automation, assembly lines and the enslaving of man by machines, he hit upon an effective way to introduce sound without disturbing his comedy of pantomime: The voices in the movie are channeled through other media. The ruthless steel tycoon talks over closed-circuit television, a crackpot inventor brings in a recorded sales pitch, and so on. The only synched sound is Charlie's famous tryout as a singing waiter; perhaps after Garbo spoke, the only thing left was for Charlie to sing.",

            "content": "Often referred to as the \"swan song\" of the Little Tramp, MODERN TIMES is perhaps also the film which most thoroughly examines the various aspects of this character's personality. Equipped with the playfulness which turns him into a child-like creature in our eyes, he does at the same time possess an unquestioned humanity, and is clearly capable of showing affection towards others. True, Chaplin had demonstrated the multi-dimensionality of the Tramp many times prior to this film, but never, I believe, quite on this level; although never mean-spirited, the Tramp can still be quite outrageous to his surroundings, and sometimes prone to take advantage of others. Yet, he is also generally well-intentioned, and this soft spot is made all the more evident after acquainting \"the Gamine;\" the chemistry between Chaplin and Paulette Goddard may explain, in part, why the Tramp turns into such a full- fledged personality in this film.The seed of MODERN TIMES is reported to have occurred in Chaplin's mind after the comedian was invited to Henry Ford's factories. Although quite certainly invited due to his celebrity status, Chaplin turned out to be more shocked than impressed. Prior to his visit, Chaplin had recently returned from a year-long world tour, and actually considered retiring from making movies; one major reason being that he felt uncertain as to whether he'd be able to enter the world of \"talking films.\" His first production completed after the \"talkie\" revolution, CITY LIGHTS, had been a huge hit despite being essentially a silent, but Chaplin felt far from convinced that he could sustain his popularity at a time when not only Hollywood, but the whole world had long since greeted synchronized sound on film with open arms. He finally decided to gamble on yet another silent production, albeit with a soundtrack and a few instances of audible talking now and then, not spoken by the Tramp but used whenever devises such as radio were required for in the film.The result is one of Chaplin's finest films. Although often considered a satire, the Tramp and the Gamine display a tenderness into the film which assures that the more thought- provoking moments never appear truly dark or depressing. The Tramp struggles to survive with the Gamine much as he had done with Jackie Coogan in THE KID; however, this instance is interesting in particular because it is Chaplin's very leading lady who is made into his partner for survival. The Tramp is finally united with a woman who is struck at the same level in society as himself. Although we are reminded several times throughout the film that their relationship is not really romantic, but rather has the feel of a sort of friendship, it makes for a fascinating contrast to Chaplin's previous feature films, where the leading lady to a larger degree had functioned as a vessel to the story.Besides Chaplin's ability to make us truly care about the Tramp and the Gamine, MODERN TIMES is also very arguably the comedian's funniest film. One highlight occurs early on in, while the Tramp is still employed in the factory, and chosen as a guinea pig in order to demonstrate a \"time-sparing feeding machine.\" Inevitably, the invention turns out to be disastrous. So much time is spent on installing and repairing it that even a truly slow eater would be more effective. I've seen this sequence a countless number of times by now, but I'm still likely to lose my breath with laughter upon the next viewing. The feeding-machine is a great example of how Chaplin never abandoned a good idea; in his memoirs, he claims that the idea had occurred to him some twenty years before, when he'd briefly considered making a science-fiction comedy. Other obvious highlights include when Chester Conklin is served lunch by the Tramp while being hopelessly stuck in the machinery, or the Tramp's famous Nonsense Song towards the end. However, one should note that many of Chaplin's funniest moments include the small things which one might miss at first; such as when the Tramp, in a daydream he's sharing with the Gamine, with a solemn and proud expression picks a fruit from a tree, only to be told that dinner is served, whereupon he indifferently kicks it away!No doubt about it; MODERN TIMES is still hilarious and touching after all these years. One question hard to ignore, of course, is whether the satire on the industrial world still holds up; I do not quite share Stan Laurel's opinion that Chaplin made this film solely for the sake of comedy, though the plot's potential for great gags was obviously a major motivation. My own response is that yes, also as a satire MODERN TIMES definitely stands the test of time. Do keep in mind that the design of the \"factories\" in this film were likely seen as ridiculous exaggerations also in the 1930s; thus, it may not be too difficult to accept these as abstractions still able to get a point across to audiences of today. The essence of the madness which Chaplin portrays in these \"factories\" is highly recognizable. In my opinion, Chaplin does not so much criticize technology in itself; indeed, we are also presented here with examples on how technology has made everyday life more comfortable for many, as seen in the Tramp's daydream. As Chaplin himself experienced great poverty during much of his childhood, he likely recognized this. What rather was on Chaplin's mind, may have been how the employees at the factory were treated as part of the machinery. This may not have been that much of an original idea; but Chaplin's ability to make humor out of it, quite definitely demonstrates his uniqueness.By Chaplin's standards, MODERN TIMES was not such a huge financial hit; it made less money than his previous features, and reviews were mixed. Thankfully, today it is rightfully considered by most to be a masterpiece, and it provides several of Chaplin's most iconic moments.",

            "content": "Modern Times is funny movie about a factory worker (Charlie Chaplin) who always tries to do the right thing in work and life, but he always gets a negative result and gets fired. The movie is also about a homeless woman (Paulette Goddard) who steals food for her family to survive. The factory worker and the homeless woman meet each other when the homeless woman steals a loaf of bread, and the factory worker tries to help her when she gets in trouble with the police. Throughout the rest of the movie, the Chaplin character helps the woman and she helps him until they are both successful workers in the end.Although the movie was a comedy, it communicated some ideas about society and workers. The theme was focused on the factory worker and his as well as others' struggle for dignity. He always tried to do the right things, even if it meant going to jail for someone else. Both the factory worker and the woman wanted to have a good life, but they often made bad choices (stealing food). This movie reminds me of Housefull, a movie from Bollywood in India. The character Aarush is like the factory worker in Modern Times. In the first part of the movie, it shows that wherever he goes and whatever he does, he has bad luck. For example, he works in a casino and one scene everyone was winning, but when he walked into the casino, everyone started to lose; that was good for the casino but not for the customers. His life changes when he meets his true love.The movie was filmed in black and white and there wasn't much difference throughout the movie in the lighting. It is a comedy movie and shows some scenes that would normally be something impossible to happen and a person survive. For example, when Chaplin's suitcase gets stuck in the machinery and they try to get the equipment out. This part of the movie was very funny, but a person would never survive if it would happen in real life. The Modern Times film was a silent movie but some dialogue was dubbed in later. The mouth movement and words were not synchronized. Sometimes someone was speaking but no one's mouth was moving.I really enjoyed the movie, and it was interesting how I could understand what was going on just by the way they were acting; there was very little speaking. The movie did a good job of showing the struggles of the factory worker in funny way.",

There are funny moments, but it seems, at times, that the social commentary of the film overpowers them. The repetitive and draining nature of factory life, as portrayed in one of the opening scenes, is likely all too familiar to those who earn their livings in this way. Unemployment, homelessness and just plain bad luck are other elements that are explored throughout the film. On another note, the film doesn't remain completely silent since there are several instances when music or dialogue can be heard. It's a type of hybrid silent/talkie similar to The Jazz Singer. Overall, this is a good film that should be viewed and enjoyed by film buffs, but I would give a somewhat reluctant recommendation to casual film fans since it does require patience to allow the story to develop.",

            "content": "\"Modern Times\" (1936): Charlie Chaplin isn't my favorite comedian from the 20's & 30's. I'm partial to W. C. Fields, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd... Chaplin is a little too stylized and feminine for my taste, but this is an interesting film for a couple of reasons: One, it's presented as though a SILENT film from the earlier days of movies \u0096 yet was more than a decade past silence by then. Two, the sets, costumes, and locations are pure 1936 middle and upper class Art Deco, which is a pleasure to peruse. WHY was \"Modern Times\" done as a silent? It HAS music and dubbed tracks of all sorts, so it's NOT actually silent, but all the dialog IS, with the old style use of caption cards. I think the film tried to straddle eras and audiences. It was the middle of the Great Depression. People needed laughs, and comfort \"food\" - so to speak. Presenting a new film in the old style took the audience back to BEFORE the stock market crash of 1929, if for no longer than 90 minutes. I also wonder (and have not researched) if Chaplin, though still famous, was by then something of an anachronism, and could not make the full transition. This WAS the last appearance of his \"Little Tramp\" character. LOTS of actors lost their careers when \"Talkies\" came along. They did NOT have good voices. Valentino apparently sounded like a girlie-twirp. Chaplin also got himself into trouble with the Government - OUR \"free speech\" Government \u0096 by espousing unpopular politics. There are other reasons I enjoy this film: the black/gray/white value range is lovely, and so is the leading lady, a young Paulette Goddard. What a babe! She could easily be Courtney Cox's genetic Great Grandmother. Oh, and I laughed out loud a few times...some of the wit still holds up. You have to hand it to Chaplin \u0096 he directed, wrote, scored...did it all in this film, and THAT'S a serious effort worth respect.",

The bare-footed wandering girl is waiting for a surprise to another wanderer after the corner of the police station. She said she found her home. While waiting again, she danced barefoot on the street in front of the door. The children with messy hair looked at her. The big-bellied boss with a gold pocket watch in her pocket stared at her.

He didn't, maybe he didn't know in the era when he was destined to get no results, maybe it was meaningless for the wandering people. He just encouraged her, with warmth and strength, and this is the power of no solution. Some are like \"live\" to live for life, and the end of the effort is only effort.Why did Chaplin add love to \"Modern Times\", in the cold and hard industrial society, in the rapid rotation and crushing of gears, people only make fertilizer for others' desires, but no one can fight the smell of gasoline The desire for generator smell. What can be left after rolling, or what might be left? The answer he gave us seemed to be love. It is too extravagant, too romantic, too gentle, and gold-like love in this black background that is too cheap, too cold, too suffocating. This arrangement is a cruel comfort.Do the men and women really understand each other? do not know. I can only say that they may not understand themselves, and the two of them are so similar, that is, the front and back of the flame. In this world, there is no way to go. Where are they going home? The vague answer is sad. The author seems to realize this, he let the hostess put on shoes and let them both go on the road together. It seems to convey us again: buck up, there is no reason and maybe you can't see the back up of hope, it is the only way out of nowhere.",

I just watched the film today, thinking I should see it at least once. But then I kept recognizing vignettes that I must have seen within the last six months. That's the impression it made on me. And frankly, I was appalled by the socialist themes that an uber rich capitalist embraced. The Tramp is supposedly jobless, except that he gets jobs easily. He loses them not to the Depression but to his own poor performance and incompetence. He celebrates theft of food but celebrates it through gluttony. In short he has very few redeeming features here. When you can't identify with the \"hero\", much of the interest in the film is lost. All that said, it wasn't a bad film, just not a very good one. I give it a 6.",

Telling the story of The Tramp as he struggles with the change with modern society, he meets a young girl whose father was killed and whose sisters were taken from her, Chaplin forms a bond with her and does everything in his power to assist her. Perfectly directed with stunning cinematography and iconic shots (none more so than Chaplin in the interior of the machinery as he goes through the assembly line), Chaplin masters everything once more. The score is beautiful, his direction is perfect, his performance as perfect if not better and with a strong supporting performance, Chaplin's \"Modern Times\" masterfully conveys the struggle of poverty better than most \"talkie\" films ever could. Brilliantly paced for a film with no dialogue, \"Modern Times\" is a hilarious film that is satisfying in every possible way.",

Even now, more than 70 years later, when I watch the film, I still have a lot of resonance.\nThe hero charlot is a modern times a line of the large factory worker, day and night neurotic repeating the same work, even go to the toilet of a cigarette to enjoy all selfish capitalist deprived of ruthless, finally because of strain, charlot mental disorders, was taken to a psychiatric hospital, factory at the same time, he also lost survival job. Soon after, he left the hospital. On the street, however, he was mistaken by the police for a leader of the workers' revolt and put in prison. While in prison, he mistakenly eats heroin, which leads to excitement and guilt. A series of bizarre events take place on charlors. Finally, he is released early, and the warden says to him, \"you are free.\" But charlough said, \"can you keep me here for a few more days? I'm fine here.\" Perhaps it was only in that absurd age that charlough had such an absurd idea.\nIt was true that he might as well have been in prison as out. Although he had gained a semiotically free existence, he still lived in a larger prison, in which the rich did as they pleased and the proles had no home. After a series of adventures, the heroine falls in love with charlough, and they find their own paradise -- a small shack by the river. They had imagined the ideal paradise, such as the life in the villa of a rich family, such as the happy time in the big department store, but these were only fantasies, the paradise that really belonged to them, and it was only the small hut by the river. Here, I see the warmth and happiness they never had.\nBy the end of the film, charlough and the beautiful heroine are on the run again, but the chapter is titled \"dawn.\" I think Chaplin wished they were walking on the road to the dawn. When charlough saw the heroine frowning, he told her to smile and smile at the dawn.\nMore than 70 years later, when I watched this film, I did not feel the passage of time at all. Today, it is true that the story in the film happens every day around me. Maybe there are a lot of charlors around me, maybe I'm charlors after all, who knows.\nAt this point, I think of a scene at the beginning of the film. The first scene is a flock of sheep scrambling to get out of the sheepfold. When I see this, I think of myself, as I walk in and out of the subway station with thousands of people during my daily commute. I think the two shots at the beginning of the modern era have every reason to be the greatest and most classic montage in movie history.\nAs dickens said, it was the best of times, it was the worst of times.",

But, that doesn't matter as long as the movie that I watch is a masterpiece or special feature of its time. And Charlie Chaplin, as everybody knows, is maestro for silent film era. He is funny but genius, yes, a best figure of early cinema.\"Modern Times\" is my first Charlie Chaplin's, this is important because first time watching can create a pure impression. Yes, I surprised with Chaplin's impossible yet dangerous scene like skating in the second floor. That scene really makes me thump. Every single accelerated act is honestly weird for me, but sometimes it looks funny with great acting of Charlie himself. Other peculiarity is its absurd scene, like suddenly fallen to river, enter to the heart of machine, and singing also dancing. With some touch of sentimental soul, that's just make the whole film amazing.That's only the outer part of the movie, but the soul of the film is critic for the government, or economic system, especially in the United States of America. Explicitly, you can watch the crowd in front of factory to get a job, and some kind of misjudgment in the real life. What I want to say is even the innocent and kind man like the tramp will suffer if the system is not fit. That's the 1930's America, it's also like the system of developing country nowadays. As the country develops, it meets so many problem that's make many people become a victim. The Tramp is a symbol of poor man struggle with violent world, you must work hard and smart to be the \"winner\" of your life freedom. I mean freedom of possession, prosperity, and to opine.That's a deep message that is delivered with this complex yet humble movie, \"Modern Times\".

Rather the both of them set out to greet the dawn, smiling in a heart-warming finale...But \"Modern Times\" is also a film that addresses the dehumanizing aspects the rationalization of labor brings to the modern employee, where the sheep flock into the factories only to become cogs among cogs in a machinery which eats them up. You can take that quite literally in a Chaplin film. And to this day the poignancy of Chaplin's ingenious take on the consequences of industrialization which he fights against as the black sheep are as valid as they were when the film was made. And as funny - after all it's perfectionist Charlie Chaplin who is at work here, who wrote, directed, composed music for and starred in his film. See him tighten screws at the conveyor belt and everywhere else he is not supposed to, head a communist movement, sink a ship, roller-skate with a blindfold, being fed by a new invention, or cause chaos in a magnificent set piece that could have been taken right out of \"Metropolis\".

In Lang the society is infected and fallen, dystopic, but in Chaplin and Tati the society itself seems to be largely unaware of its mechanics, which adds a tragic dimension.In this sense Chaplin and Tati after him are more concerned with the individual's, the outsider's, perception of a world to which the general population seems to be oblivious to. That something's wrong is felt to the core by the poor workers within the factories in this film. It's this hopelessness that leads the Tramp to excel in Vigoan anarchism.Some of the jokes are iconic in their visual creativity, others make use of sound quite brilliantly. What is surprising is how Chaplin takes many of the jokes to their extremes, as the visual gag of the lunch machine plays far too long for my taste, just as the scene with the lady on the bench.This might summarize this film for me: on one hand wildly creative, on the other unexpectedly prolix, perhaps because of its self-awareness.",

Think of the inimitable Lucille Ball's fight with the chocolate assembly line!Later on the film drops to 8 stars as the story moves to the usual Chaplin pathos of mistaken identity and waif-like ing\u00e9nues that share with him the rough times.

It is nothing of the sort. It is a rather tedious mix of sentimentality and slapstick, and was anachronistic even when it was made in 1936 in that it pretends to be from the silent era, which had ended in 1927.To be fair, there are a few funny scenes, all of which take place in the factory. The ones involving food are the best. All the scenes outside the factory are boring and many of them are hopelessly sentimental. The music, composed by Chaplin, is horrendous. Chaplin's wife is pretty, but can't act.If the film had had a proper story developing the factory theme it could have been better. As it is, it is a typical collection of music hall / vaudeville set pieces which are only loosely connected. Many of these scenes do not advance the plot and aren't funny. The scene where Chaplin sings is also not at all funny.In my view Chaplin was a one-trick pony with one character and a silly walk. What he does, he does well, but there is really no range in it, and those who claim there is are deceiving themselves.In short - there is no deep meaning to the film at all - don't believe those who say there is.",

            "content": "Initially, I found it hard to appreciate Modern Times because it is so unlike the films I usually admire and enjoy. I am used to feature films that either tell a story or expound a coherent and consistent idea. This movie does neither.It starts with the Little Tramp being driven to a nervous breakdown by the regimentation of factory life. He recovers but is then imprisoned (by accident). He meets the Gamin (Paulette Goddard). He then accidentally foils a prison escape and is released. He has a succession of jobs, each of which he quickly loses. He sets up home with the Gamin and finally gets a more permanent job but is then forced to flee with her when the authorities try to put her into an orphanage. The movie ends with the couple walking off down the road to bravely face whatever the future may hold.This is a sequence of events in chronological order, but not really a story.It does have some sort of narrative arc, but most of the individual scenes are irrelevant to it. Similarly, it does have some (garbled) ideas to expound, but Chaplin is quite happy to shelve the ideas whenever he sees a good gag on the horizon.For example, he clearly wanted to say something about the dehumanisation of the assembly line. This is the inspiration for the opening sequence in which the Tramp is literally chewed up and spat out by the machinery. This leads on quite naturally to his final breakdown, where he dances round the factory like a disruptive, anarchic imp. These two scenes have an obvious thematic and dramatic link, but wedged between them is a whimsical scene with an automatic feeding machine. Although this idea plays better than it sounds, it does not really help develop the movie's story or its themes and feels like an awkward intrusion.After the Tramp's recovery from his breakdown, Chaplin's attention suddenly switches from the demoralising nature of work to the lack of it. However, his concern with the problem of unemployment is completely undermined by a plot device which means that the tramp is actually able to get work whenever he wants it. Of course, he quickly loses the various jobs he lands, but that says nothing about the precariousness of employment during the Great Depression \u2013 he loses the jobs by accident and purely for comic effect.The muddle and contradiction become even more apparent as the picture develops. After a period of deprivation, the Tramp bursts in on the Gamin to triumphantly announce that the factory has reopened and is hiring workers. He then thrusts himself to the head of the queue of people fighting for a job and is one of the last to make it though the gates. At this point we have to remind ourselves that this is the very factory, and the very work, that drove him mad in the opening scenes.There is also a scene where the couple try to visualise what it might be like if they were leading normal, middle class, suburban lives, but it is not clear whether Chaplin regards this as desirable or simply as a bourgeois trap, so the sequence ends inconclusively.And so on.At this point, it might seem that I am saying this movie is almost completely worthless, but against all these criticisms must be set the wonderful elegance, grace and precision of most of the comic set pieces.Chaplin perfected his art in a long series of classic short films, where he used the camera very simply, to record his performances, not to create them. Despite his growing ambitions in the Twenties and Thirties I don't think he ever really developed beyond this stage. His feature films, like Modern Times, are really just a succession of more or less stand-alone sequences, loosely strung together. He was still making shorts.Modern Times is undoubtedly less than the sum of its parts, but I found that once I had accepted this I could appreciate that most of the parts were pretty damn good. In the end I didn't regret the ninety minutes I spent on it.If you just ignore the pretentious claims often made for this movie (and Chaplin's own pretensions) I think you will find that Modern Times still has a quite a bit to offer.",

How would his so called masterpiece be?Well, Modern Times follows the classic Chaplin character, the tramp, as he tries to earn some money without losing his mind in modern society - and during the great depression, no less! As you might imagine, the cartoonish tramp has a hard time doing so, and the cold industrial world is cruel and unforgiving to him.I'll be honest here: I had such a hard time focusing on this movie. It has a couple of fun moments (the nose-powder scene is the best moment in the whole movie imo, and the fantasy home is quite funny as well), but most of it falls flat for me. It's like watching an old Disney cartoon without much of a plot or charm for about 90 minutes - it gets old really, really quickly. And cinema elitists truly be like \"dude, bro put social commentary in a film in the frickin' 1930s! What a genius fr fr\". Astonishing to me.But in all seriousness, yeah, I think it's kinda boring. It has some scenes with visual symbolism and it's not done that badly, some scenes here are considered iconic for a reason, but I just feel almost nothing watching this film. The gamin is boring, the main plot feels like stitched-together ideas and sketches, and most jokes aren't funny to me - slightly amusing at best. Maybe I'm just fed up with Chaplin's style after watching 3 of his films, but that's how I genuinely feel watching it. 5.1/10 on this one.",

            "content": "By 1936 silent pictures were relegated to the dustbin of history, and most of its stars had fallen on hard times. The only luminaries from to era to survive were Greta Garbo and Ronald Colman, both of whom saw their careers shine brighter following the transition to sound. Oh, and let's not forget Charlie Chaplin.....sort of. Having honed his craft in the days of the music hall, Chaplin was reluctant to part with the art form that made him a millionaire many times over.When CITY LIGHTS came out in 1931, Chaplin stubbornly preferred not to let his voice do his talking for him, making him the only silent star to continue using his tried and true formula and still come out on top. He did, however, make a concession or two by employing some sound effects, such as a whistle. Chaplin's next project, MODERN TIMES, took five years to reach the screen. The idea came to him when he was in London promoting CITY LIGHTS..After being introduced to Mohandas Gandhi, who was also in England at the same time, both men expressed their concerns over how technology was threatening to make the workforce redundant.Chaplin was equally worried about the exploitation of workers during the Great Depression. This was a time when a quarter of America's population was unemployed, and those who were lucky enough to have a job toiled for more than ten hours a day with only a meager paycheck to show for their labors. Well aware that comedy is the most potent form of social commentary, Chaplin used his Little Tramp as a microcosm for the working class.Our hero is one of many cogs in the machine, working on tightening bolts in an assembly line with nary a break. Management, seeking not to lose a minute of productivity over something they consider inconvenient such as the lunch break, attempt to test out a contraption which will automatically feed the employees while they toil on the assembly line. Guess who the guinea pig will be???After the experiment goes hilariously awry -with sound effects- the Tramp is sent back to the assembly line where the non-stop toll brings about a public, extroverted nervous breakdown, leading to his institutionalization.",

I am a snob of sorts when it comes to movies, refuse to see beyond the first American Pie movies (and the first would have been the same if I would have known) and the Farrelly brothers make me ill, and there's really no way to change my mind when I see movies like Charade, and Pressure Point.  Looking back on movies put out in the past and trying to compare them to movies now is like trying to compare a steak dinner to a BigMac.  Sure we're all CG-ed up, and I enjoy my share of new movies, but last night I decided to watch Modern Times.  Now, black and white?  Silent? I was not all about it at all.  I like old movies and what not, but Im not about to jump into Metropolis or anything, but I have to say that I laughed about 150% more then I thought I would.  It had some great footage of the funny man of the early 1900's and the situations were just Laugh Out Loud.Even though I'm not a Chaplin follower I did get a wow feeling when he started singing in the restaurant, knowing that this is the first time Charlie Chaplin has spoken in a movie.  On of my favorite scenes in this movie is when the Tramp tries to work as a night watchmen in a department store.  He takes his homeless girlfriend in to have some food, fun and a comfortable place to sleep.  Part of the fun is when they try out the roller-skates and its all funny from there.  I truly enjoyed watching this little film and I will definitely be seeing more Chaplin movies.  To think, I thought this was going to be one of those films where everything was spoiled because of the thievery that goes on today.  Glad to see that this gem was virtually left untouched.",

He knew all too well how fast the future was coming up, and how cinema had changed with the advent of sound recording. Like many, he feared mechanization and modern industry. He knew that his legendary Tramp character had to be put to bed, so he decided to go out in style. The picture is a tribute not only to The Tramp as a cinematic icon, but a showcase for Chaplin's truly varied talents as actor, writer, and director.To go without sound when you don't have to do so is a mark of true class. Chaplin reminds us of how much we can rely on visual information to understand a story. The quick close-ups, tight edits, and the slightly exaggerated, histrionic scenes with Paulette Goddard are a stunning and pleasurable flashback to the simple melodramatic silent films of earlier years. It is sophisticated and serious despite the hilarious scenes. It was almost as if Chaplin wanted to remind modern film audiences that pictures of the silent era are an entirely separate genre from the \"talkies.\" The closing scene, with the two leads walking off down the road, is elegaic and touching. I simply cannot understand why the Academy did not recognize the artistry that went into so many components of this picture.

He struggles to keep up with the ever quickening pace of the production line where he screws nuts onto bolts and suffers a mental breakdown. After being released from hospital, The Tramp finds himself as the accidental leader of a Communist rally and is thrown in jail. Once released he finds life in the Depression ruined 30s difficult but meets an orphan girl with whom he develops a friendship. The film then follows their ups and downs as they try to scrape by and stay out of jail.Modern Times is one of Chaplin's best remembered films and features some wonderful set pieces. Just some of the iconic scenes include; when he gets caught up in the cogs of the factory machines, when he mistakes cocaine for salt, when he roller skates blindfolded and when he is used to test a new feeding machine. All of these scenes are laugh out loud funny. While the film features some of Chaplin's funniest moments, the laughs are spread more thinly than in some of his earlier films. This is much more of a comedy/drama than out and out comedy.Chaplin's politics are obvious to see throughout. The opening scene shows sheep being lead out and then cuts to men streaming into a factory. Once inside, the workers are worked to exhaustion and we see the harsh conditions of the unemployed. Chaplin is later falsely accused of leading a Communist march and gets thrown in jail, an eerie premonition of what later happened to him. It is obvious that Chaplin blames modern industrialization for the conditions of the Great Depression and understandable why it came under scrutiny at the time.Chaplin is joined on screen by the beautiful Paulette Godard, who was also his wife at the time. Despite playing a homeless orphan she still manages to dazzle and is also superb in the more touching scenes. Chaplin as always is sublime. There are little touches in every scene that cement him as cinema's greatest entertainer.The film is still considered 'silent', despite it containing 'talkie' moments. Most of these moments come from inanimate objects or from one or two characters but I wish it had been one way or the other. It's a bit of a cop out to be a mixture of silent and spoken but by 1936 silent films were considered very old fashioned so its understandable why the decision to introduce some dialogue was made.Unfortunately, Modern Times was one of Chaplin's final films and the last to feature his Tramp character. For that reason its ending carries even greater significance and is wonderful. The film contains some of Chaplin's best moments and is a wonderful reminder of his genius and the class of his film making.www.attheback.blogspot.com",

Perhaps the most timeless theme in any Charles Chaplin movie - a man's struggle inside the insanity of the modern world. Technology is technology, no matter how advanced and small. And novel technology, no matter how good it might look on the paper, doesn't usually work as it's supposed to (the magnificent scene with the automatic feeder). Already in that era, Chaplin compared the people rushing to work with the herd of sheep, a metaphor that is widely overused nowadays.'Modern Times' is a pure lighthearted comedy, with slight tragic undertones, but in this case, they are so brief that barely the audience has the time to shed a tear when another fantastic burst of humor wipes the drama out of our minds. Yet, this is not a simple comedy. Lighthearted, I said, yes, but the movie carries a heavy message.Chaplin performs some of his better-known stunts - rollerskating in the department store and swimming through the heavy machinery and of course the unforgettable singing scene at the end. I'm sure that people at that time were quite surprised by how good a singer Chaplin was. And how anyone can forget Paulette Goddard as a fiery\u00e4eyed Gamin. That performance is the epitome of a self-reliant strong woman who can handle any situation. Real badass woman.Chaplin has created a movie that offers us joy even nearly ninety years after its release. And with the uplifting line from the movie I end this review - Buck up - never say die!

            "content": "Most people consider industrialization as a move forward in time because of decreasing necessity of physical labor despite increasing efficiency. Charlie Chaplin's 1936 film Modern Times takes a different stance by portraying industrialization as one of the casual factor of unemployment during the Great Depression.To begin with, the movie opens with a graphic match between farm animals and factory workers. This aims to show that the workers are living the life of farm animals, which implies unsanitary housing, poor nutrition, and disrespect from those in charge, whether they be farmers or employers. This is further elaborated on when Chaplin is working arduously in the assembly line, where he repeatedly falls behind and gradually begins to loose his mind. Eventually, his condition deteriorates so that the movements of screwing on a bolt become a stereotyped behavior that he is unable to stop during even his lunch break or after he leaves the factory. Consequently, he looses his job and is sent to a mental institution. The efficiency of the machinery is so high that it becomes impossible for an average man like Chaplin to keep up with, making him obsolete to his employer.After recovering in the mental institution, Chaplin is in search of a new job. As he is leaving the hospital, the film cuts to images of automobiles and throngs of people in an urban setting. Not long afterwards, he is wrongly imprisoned as a communist. Both the hospital and the prison represent an escape from the world of fast-paced machinery and waves of people moving in a purposeful and robotic manner. This is evident in that Chaplin repeatedly attempts to be arrested throughout the film so as to escape the harsh reality of unemployment. Keeping in line with its classification as a comedy, Chaplin ironically portrays a mental institution and a prison as more attractive living options for the protagonist than facing the modern industrialized world in which he is unable to find a job.Later in the film there is a quick scene of the Gamin's father, \"one of the unemployed,\" sitting in his empty kitchen, clearly concerned about the livelihood of his family. This is an important, although brief, moment in the movie because it deviates from the comedic tone of the film as a whole. Here, we see the serious impact of unemployment on a family, one whom viewers may better relate to. Due to the nature of the Chaplin's loss of employment, as a viewer we can infer that the Gamin's father has likely lost his job due to modernization. Had the father lost his job due to personal vices or lack of professionalism, Chaplin would have included a man drinking, reclined comfortably in a chair. Instead, Chaplin's use of an unadorned man sulking in a wooden chair shows that the man is more concerned than he is relaxed.Later in the movie, Chaplin finds work at a factory while staying in a rundown shack with the Gamin. The scene begins with a crowd of people outside the factory gates, all waiting to be let in for work. Chaplin has a difficult time learning how to use the new machinery on his first day of work. He accidentally places a co-workers jacket into a machine, destroying a \"family heirloom\" that was in the pocket. This can be interpreted as the end of older traditions which are being dominated by modern industrialization just as the watch was \"ruined\" by the machine. Chaplin's co-workers also gets trapped in the machine and despite Chaplin's efforts, he is unable to free his coworker. Defeated and hungry, the co-worker asks Chaplin to feed him his lunch while immobilized in the machine. This clearly illustrates the domination of modernized machinery over human beings.Chaplin's film represents his perspective on the negative effects of industrialization on unemployment during the great depression. Although he makes some good claims, it is important to note that he uses hyperbole of the workers' conditions for comedic effects. For example, workers are rarely completely immersed in work with new technologies without any prior training or introduction to the methods necessary to attain efficiency. Nevertheless, on a whole, Chaplin's Modern Times rightfully earned its acclaim as a \"culturally significant\" work as deemed by the Library of Congress because it intelligently highlights some of the key downfalls of industrialization\u2014unemployment being the most significant.",

In this memorable, hilarious and touching movie, Chaplin takes on the modern era along with his newfound girl friend (Paulette Goddard) in a quest for happiness.Chaplin is a factory worker at a rather boring factory controlled by a boss who talks to his employees through screens (If that's not television, then I don't know what it is). With the same lame, repetitive work each day, Chaplin suffers a breakdown and is sent to the hospital. He recovers and is released, only to be arrested for accidentally being the leader of a communist parade. Goddard is a homeless girl who struggles everyday to live. Chaplin and Goddard eventually meet and the two vow to get a new home, `Even if I have to work for it!'There are countless memorable sight gags in Modern Times. My favorite is when Chaplin, employed as a mechanic's assistant, gets his boss stuck in a machine. Another equally memorable gag is when Chaplin, in prison, gets hyperactive after sprinkling \u0091Nose Powder' on his food and inadvertently adverts a prison break.  There is much symbolism in this movie. For most of the film, the only things that have sound are mechanical objects such as machines, cars and radios. But for most of the film (As he was through the beginning of the silent era) Chaplin refuses to talk. His memorable song at the end, however, seems to show that he had given up and was ready to enter the modern times of cinema.But he did not change his slapstick humor. If only all comedians these days could be as funny or creative as Chaplin was without using sex jokes or molesting animals. I guess that's the `Modern Times' for you.",

This is the first Chaplin I have seen outside of a few short pieces when I was a kid. \nWhat struck me is how applicable this movie is to the society of our times. I guess this transcendancy over time period is a sign of any good art.  As I watched \"Modern Times\" I couldn't help but think that living in 2001 seems to actual be old-fashioned if you reflect on the dittohead pundits that rule the airwaves, mega-corporate owned & controlled media, politicians that fire up the masses over religion, Iraqi radar, and the usual sanctimonious hypocrisy to make them forget about how they work harder & longer for less, or other important problems.  Heck, insinuating healthcare for the masses in our modern times gets one labeled a \"commie pinko\" by Rush Limbaugh et al.  So can you imagine the reaction in modern times of a group of workers peacefully walking down the street with a guy waving a red flag?  They'd have the riot cops out spraying Mace & pepper gas before you can hum a few bars from \"Smile.\"  Can you imagine a film with leftist, socialist sympathies being released in these modern times?

The gibberish singing of the tramp will probably never get old, it's quite sublime.There's also some very cool cinematic tools such as the classic gear scene, which was probably pretty innovative, or the final scene with the tramp and the girl walking towards the camera.

            "content": "In this film Chaplin explores the alienation suffered by men in, as the title goes, \"Modern Times\" in which man is just another cogwheel within a colossal machine -as can be literally observed at the beginning.The movie starts criticizing everyman's role in society: immediately after a shot of sheep passing by there is another one of workmen coming out of the subway for work. Man has become not only unnecessary but just a mere element of that herd unthinkingly going wherever the shepherd (i.e., the leaders) wants to.Chaplin displays strong criticism towards capitalist society for it seeks production alone, leaving worker's well-being aside (even trying to minimize lunchtime by using worker-feeding machines) and splitting work into minute tasks up to the level of driving the protagonist crazy: forced to repeat once and again the sole act of fastening hex nuts he ends up spastic and compulsively trying to fasten anything that might resemble hex nuts (we could say \"he's nuts over hex nuts\". Easy joke, but I couldn't resist it.) Critique goes on: constant surveillance (even in toilets), bureaucratic management of orphanages (already explored in Chaplin's \"The Kid\"); fear of freedom (expressed by the main character's willingness of staying in prison for he's much safer and even cozier); Police draconian measures (as seen when a starving kid is arrested after stealing a loaf of bread.) Chaplin employed sound to further elaborate his statement. Thus, even though the film is mainly silent, sound is used throughout its footage with a clear intention: voices are only heard when they come out of mechanical devices, meaning the dehumanization of technology (the president of the factory's voice whenever he speaks on-screen, the recorded disc that accompanies the worker-feeding machine, or the radio in prison.) Sheer differences between rich and poor, or political persecution of dissenting ideas are some other issues related to post-1929 USA's capitalism dealt with in this movie. Something which in turn cost Chaplin being blacklisted due to his alleged communism. Although he always denied these charges, pressure finally drove him out of the USA and to Switzerland.",

On the other hand Chaplin tells us a story about capitalism, bureaucracy, dehumanization, poverty, of the little man trapped in the big machine of the government and thrown out on the street as a piece of trash, after his employer have sucked his brains out of work. The metaphor es are so direct and colorful sometimes that you can only sit and watch speechless while the whole story is told. My favorite moments are so many but I cannot forget Charlie trapped in the big machine, Charlie going crazy on the production line, Charlie and his girl friend dreaming of a better life, etc.I repeat the story is so totally and overwhelmingly human that even the big factory and the machines cannot spoil but only stress the man, a man fighting for his normal life in a crazy and anti-human society.",

It transcends what were \"modern times\" in 1936, and it every bit as relevant and powerful in 2005, our \"modern times.\" A story of man vs. machine, individual vs. \"the system,\" and hope in the face of a world that seems to have grown apart from humanity, Modern Times is an inspiration! It is not inspirational because of the laundry list of problems facing our heroes, but because of their unrelenting resilience, their ability to \"Smile\" at the end of it all. Chaplin social commentary is presented in a satirical, yet optimistic, way, so that we are free to recognize the size of the problems at hand, but never allowed to sink into the hopelessness that such troubles often bring. We are led by Chaplin through a tumultuous time in American history; one of labor disputes, high unemployment, poverty, and despair. Fortunately we are guided by The Tramp, in his final screen appearance, all the way to the light at the end of the long, dark tunnel, his humor and pathos as poignant as ever. Through his phenomenal brand of physical comedy and ingenious directing, we see that all we need to do is smile, and not give in to the world that surrounds us, and we will see a brighter day. An extraordinary film of great power, with a message that should be seen by anyone who has ever struggled through a hard time in their life! A masterpiece!",

            "content": "I loved this movie from the fist time I've seen it and would watch it for countless times without getting tired. This is what I call flawless&timeless comedy.Yet a comedy of the more serious sort,a somewhat humorous version of a movie symbolically anticipating modernity,in the style of Metropolis or 1984. Instead of depicting this topic in an apocalyptic style,he analyzes the issue in a humorous style,at the same time critical. The story is set in hard(by the way might the title be inspired by Dickens's famous novel \"Hard Times\"?,Dickens also being a ruthless social critic,both Dickens and Chaplin having grown up in London's most desolate neighborhoods,both having experienced hunger,utter poverty,society's worst parts before they both became rich and famous)rather than modern times,in the time of the Great Depression.Whatever Chaplin stated,the film has a clear social message,the opening scene beginning with a black sheep among white ones,the very next second instead of the sheep you see a very sheepish crowd of busy workers flocking,hurrying to work(needless to say that the black sheep is,of course,the Tramp)-a brilliant symbol standing for the way consumer-society is altering mankind into animal-like,unidentified,mechanized masses. This time the Tramp,again nameless,appears in the cast simply as \"a factory worker\",but still he is nameless and also unfit for living in an industrialized(or any kind of)society. The way industrialism and modern living is altering our natural self is depicted in various scenes:long after work Chaplin's character compulsively and convulsively repeats the repetitive moments he is daily performing at the assembly-line(criticizing Ford?),the feeding machine: it feeds the worker automatically so he doesn't go on lunch break and therefore he saves time-it just shows how extremely thrifty and greedy capitalist bosses can be to introduce such appliances,and,the most iconic,best remembered scene from this movie when the little fellow is literally turned,twisted among the wheels of a huge and surrealistic industrial machine.Following various mishaps the Tramp is first believed to be a Communist,as a red flag accidentally fell of a truck and as he is following the truck in order to give the flag back he unintentionally waves the flag,attracting the masses of hungry,unemployed,angry people into the streets and into a demonstration(after all this is the Great Depression). In a series of adventures,in which the Tramp is involved,including being jailed,being taken for mad,being employed and then fired,he doesn't much alter his characteristic lifestyle-extremely miserably poor,yet somewhat careless. And he's got a female companion to stand by him,the(also nameless)Gamine,superbly acted by gorgeously attractive then-wife Paulette Goddard,as poor,wild,bohemian,good-humored as he is: they even fancy Paradise together,in a respectable home combining both modern comfort and luxury but also a return to a more natural,country-style living(almost like Biblical Paradise).Then comes my favorite scene from this movie,one of the most funny in movie history,the scene where Chaplin sings gibberish his all time hit the Nonsense song-pity that i don't have the text,I would so gladly sing along!Ironically Chaplin first wanted to sing the original version of it,the than famous hit \"Titine\" complete with all its lyrics but by not doing so he made film history-as the Tramp has the text written on his cuff which he accidentally lost he has to improvise in front of his audience,singing imaginary words sounding,without actually being so,somewhat French or Italian,accompanied by Chaplin's characteristic gestures,depicting a possible storyline for the imaginary lyrics-later on this scene was copied,without the same wit and fun in many films-for instance,look carefully at the act performed by the wandering entertainers at the hotel from Death in Venice or the carnival scene from Fellini's Vitelloni,where an overlong instrumental version of Titine is played by the band,the effect being,as expected,terribly entertaining and hilarious,matching the mood of the partying crowds,being still the perfect party music in 1953 like it was in 1936(and probably even today).Seldomly a film has captured the essence of consumerism more accurate than this-applying to our today's world more than ever,seldomly a comic has inspired so many other great comics. Should never be forgotten-that is if you need a huge portion of healthy and yet intelligent laughter over and over again.",

Being 21 years old I may have a different view on comedy and older films but I failed to see the deep emotional side of this film.The ending is emotional, thought out and very touching, but I personally felt that the simple plot consisted largely of slapstick comedy (which I have never been fond of) performed by a protagonist who could not function as a normal human being in modern society. Because of this, I found myself unable to relate to the film. I believe that a more 'normal' protagonist could have given this film much more meaning... saying this, if we had a 'normal' protagonist then this would not be a Charlie Chaplin comedy film.To summarise, my relatively low score out of 10 comes down to my age, my lack of understanding of Chaplin's history and my dislike of slapstick comedy. The reason the score isn't lower is due to my respect for Chaplin, silent films and old cinema as well as finding some of the moments in this film both amusing and touching.",

            "content": "Joe's current Rank: 1/1034 Where to begin? How to describe a film of such beauty, genius and wit? In my opinion, not only the greatest Chaplin film, but the best comedy film of all time, and a contender for the greatest film of all time.This is Chaplin's attack on modern capitalist society \u2013 attack is the wrong word, as Chaplin never attacks, he is too smart and too kind. He holds up a mirror and says, 'isn't this absurd?' We see the factory owner who constantly increases the speed on the assembly line, resulting in The Tramp being unable to stop wrenching things when he has moved off the machine and causing an uncontrollable twitch; there is the automatic dinner machine to prevent lunch breaks halting productivity; the state removing children from a caring sister in a poor but happy home; the homeless being arrested for stealing bread; the police attack on communists (a grim foreboding of Chaplin's later career). You could include all these areas in a social drama and it would be thought-provoking, but Chaplin puts these things in comedy and it is even more powerful. By representing something in drama, the creator is asking 'have you noticed that this happens in society?' But for something to work in comedy, the creator has to assume we all already know these things occur, he's showing that these things are commonplace, and yet they are absurd. There is even the great visual metaphor when Chaplin literally becomes a cog in the machine.But it's not just the social commentary that makes this film great, it's the beautiful sweetness of Chaplin's films that I love. Take the scene when The Tramp and his new girlfriend find themselves a home, a tiny wooden shack on the edge of a swamp, where a broom holds the roof up, and The Tramp enters and states, 'it's paradise!' Or when he attempts to get arrested, so whilst being held by the policeman (off screen) he helps himself to a cigar and hands out chocolate to children, taken from an unsuspecting shopkeeper trying to promote his goods.Then of course, there are the laughs. A few have already been mentioned, but the scene that, for me, is perhaps the funniest in film history, is the dancing waiter. Chaplin writes the words to a song he must perform on his cuffs, only for them to fly off as he swishes his hands in the opening of the song. His delivery is impeccable, he continues the same smile, unknowing of the situation he is about to enter, and the dramatic irony is genius. We know the problem, and our sympathy is with the poor Tramp, but we can't help but laugh. And so he quickly forms a plan to make up the words by stringing together nonsense French and Italian words (maybe others?) for the ignorant crowd, who lap it up. His delivery and timing of the song are perfect. The first time I saw it, I began by laughing so hard, then pausing and just staring as I realised what a feat of cinematic triumph I was witnessing, and then continued laughing hysterically again.If you're someone who doesn't usually watch films from as long ago as the 1930s, I urge you to reconsider and give it a chance, and this is an excellent place to start. There's a quote which I had wrongly believed was from Einstein but the internet tells me is from folk singer Pete Seeger: 'Any darn fool can make something complex; it takes a genius to make something simple.' Modern Times is the epitome of that sentiment, it boils down all the beauty of humanity and the absurdity of society into something sweet, hilarious and moving on the most basic of levels. It's the story of the pursuit of happiness in spite of the world's attempts to derail it, and a statement on the human condition. It is also very, very funny.",

We want him and the girl to get married, to have a happy life together. They need each other, and we, as the audience, need them to need each other. I think it's odd indeed that we can feel so deeply for a man who never speaks. It's odd and wonderful.Now onto the actual subject of the movie.What Chaplin does with the story is beyond brilliant. The Little Tramp lives in a world of whirring gears and blaring buzzers; a world where the only sounds are those of electronics. Machines are taking over and the Tramp has to deal with it. Then, in the final act of the film, the Tramp gives in, he enters this new world, he becomes a part of it even: He speaks. But it's like your grandfather trying to use a computer for the first time, it's a mess; his \"speaking\" ends up being a mess of gibberish, words from different languages thrown together randomly to form some strange, beautiful sounding poem. But, like your grandfather trying to use a computer, just at the end he turns back to the old ways: Pantomime and intertitles.He can't give himself over entirely; maybe next time, but not this time.

Adrift in the chaos, the Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) wanders in and out of jail, from one short-lived job to another, at the mercy of his nerves and his penchant for explosive accidents. During one of his many run-ins with the cops, he meets up with the gamin (Paulette Goddard) a poor but feisty patron of the streets. In love, in abject poverty, with nothing to hold onto but each other, they struggle to carve out a life for themselves, in spite of the odds and the brutal demands of a slapstick comedy.Unlike City Lights, my favorite Chaplin film, the screwball moments in Modern Times began to feel extraneous, and had me glancing at my watch, waiting to get back to the meat of the story. I've always loved Chaplin, but loved him for his skill as a director and actor, for his uncanny ability to make beautiful women look natural and unadorned, and for his knack at presenting poignant satire without ever sounding preachy, and not because I find him especially funny. The childish romp through the department sore is whimsical, heartwarming, and more than a little forlorn, but less can be said of the Tramp's accident-prone attempts to aid the master mechanic, which, like many sequences in the movie, feels overdrawn, and a little superficial compared to the weightier material it supplants.Sometimes I found myself wondering if the film could benefit from a hack job or two, yet it was never irksome enough to get between the movie and its reputation, for indeed, Modern Times is every bit of the classic it's purported to be. Chaplin was a man of great endings, and the ending of Modern Times \u0096 first its triumph, then its tragedy \u0096 leaves little to be desired. Also great are the opening scenes at the factory, which feel just as creepy today as they must have felt in 1936.",

            "content": "There are some movies which are more meaningful and unforgettable than they seem. Doesn't matter how many years passed filmed them, there are still impressive. Charles Chaplin's movie Modern Times (1936) is basically seen as a classic Chaplin film, with his unforgettable clumsy character The Little Tramp. As in usual Chaplin movies he does some funny acts and makes audience laugh. However, if we look from the right perspective, it's so meaningful than a basic comedy movie. It'd be considered as a great sociological analyze which is about industrial revolution and labor class. Controlling of labor class, effects of this control are just one of the topics we can see in that movie. So, I'd like to explain these topics from three sociological concepts.The first sociological concept I've seen in that movie is of course Marx's theory of alienation. It was so obvious in the first scenes of movie. There is a manufacturing process which requires no creativity; it's a routine and repeating job. Our character The Labor Boy starring by Chaplin, is a victim of this alienation process of capitalism. We see that in scenes like; where he acts like a robot, an alienated being has just got one purpose; producing. He's job is bolt tightening. However, he has no control of what he is doing; he just has to do it. So, he is absolutely alienated from the product of he is working on. Finally, because of all these process he has a breakdown. Nervous breakdown scene is a really good example of surreal comedy. Also it shows as the control imposed on workers how can badly affect them with an absurd way.Then if we could related it with another sociological concept, It'd be another Marxian theory; the class structure. Private property divides people into social classes. The relationship between one of these classes which are; bourgeois (factory owner) and proletariat (workers) is so simply portrayed in the movie. Factory owner is belonged to his own class, he doesn't even need to communicate with his workers directly, he uses tele-screens or other people to give directions to them. Workers are belonged to their class, which they have to just follow the directions from the upper-classes. So, this relationship between them reminds me the Pyramid of Capitalist System which is more-likely based on Marx's class struggle. Also, we can be related it with Marx's Exploitation of Labour theory, which leads to class struggle.So, if differences between classes are so certain, you should to control lower class for the possibility of rebel. About controlling of working class, there is an example in this movie, which we can see even in these days. In protest scene, there is a police intervention. Police is portrayed as an instrument of Bourgeois class to control working class. Considering police is a legal force, we can be related it with Marx's base and superstructure idea. There is a superstructure which is built on a legal base; police force. To sum up, Modern Times is a really important picture for the history of cinema. It's examples from real life and society give us an opportunity to analyze that examples in a sociological concept. As far as capitalist system remains, we can always see similar examples in the real life like in this movie.",

From the initial appearance of the steam engine to the embedded chip under one's skin, automation has portrayed its real facet, that of a persistent evolution which replaces man and his fragility with a more perfect machine and immortality. Is it nonetheless worthwhile? A 1936 Charlie Chaplin anticipates time and science by disputing the benefits of a technological contribution to life as we know it. Forcefully led as sheep into a subway, modern individuals sacrifice their Heimlich for the unknown; a rush towards a new slavery in order to acquire properties that are the fruits of personal fatigues rather than for overabundance. Useless belongings call for even lesser useful belongings, while the prize at stake would be an unconditional submission to a technological yoke that can induce the overpowering twitching of a body to relentlessly continue even when the machine stops. A machine that ought to remain a simple extension of individuals' will or greed, throughout perseverance accompanied by a considerable number of failures and short circuits, slowly takes over and transforms humans into its own prosthesis. In this Deus Ex Machina (ap\u00f3 m\u0113chan\u0113s the\u00f3s) situation, human beings are no longer champions of the Tragedy, but surrender to the solution itself. It is the genesis of a manichaeistic battle between two worlds; one where the desire to remain faithful to senses is only achievable through nonconformity and another that provides means of sustenance only through conformity. The inability to cohabitate both existences becomes unsustainable. Traditional ways of providing food or a roof over one's head become obsolete, and Law itself no longer protects the accidentally defenseless but accuses him, or her, of treason (\"the communist\").What is one to do? Act like the cabman in Robert Louis Stevenson's short story The Body Snatcher, who shifts from an initial assumption of digging graves and provide corps for scientific purposes, to uncontrollable and impulsive murders? Perhaps abandon ourselves like Dr. David Kibner (Leonard Nimoy) to an emotionless, yet eternal, dimension in a 1978 San Francisco (Invasion of the Body Snatchers, 1978)? Or possibly allow a victorious artificial intelligence to facilitate our final transformation into humans' next biotechnological essence, just like HAL 9000 (IBM) did with Dr. Dave Bowman by turning him into a new \"Star Child\" (2001 A Space Odyssey, 1968)? For what purpose is it all if, in the end, artificial intelligence is moved by the sole aim of resembling Human Kind in its \"perfection\"? Humanity would then face a situation in which a highly advanced robotic boy name David desires to become human in order to feel his mother's love (Artificial Intelligence, 2001). \"Buck Up \u0096 Never say die. We'll get along!\" (Modern Times, 1968). Let us walk toward the sunset a little bit longer",

The movie brings back some memories of my theater class under another genius, Professor Anton Juan, who is probably already a legend in the Philippine Theater history. Sir Anton required us to watch Modern Times in order to get insights about basic acting movements. Back then in 1998, it was extremely difficult to find classic films because there weren't any pirated DVDs available. Good thing, a classmate found a video rental shop where classic films in VHS were available to be let. We watched the movie in White Plains, at the house of one of my classmates. Prior to watching the film, we haven't seen any single film by Chaplin. We knew who Charlie Chaplin was but we didn't know any of his works. He was just that funny tramp with a funny mustache known around the world.Watching Modern Times was a revelation for me. It was laugh-out-loud funny yet picturesque and thought-provoking. The film depicts the plight of Man in the modern world of industrialization, where men are like robots literally being winded by gears of monstrous machines or droves of sheep moving side by side aimlessly without a shepherd.It is a story of a factory worker who became jaded by the monotony of his job, tightening the screws of some metal plates. The dreariness of his life messed his sanity and he was sent to the hospital after attacking people with his monkey wrenches and tools. After being released, by pure unlucky accident, he was put into prison after being mistaken as a leader of a strike. Once in prison, he felt that it was much better to live there than out in the streets where people lead miserable lives, jobless, hungry, and desensitized. In and out of prison, he just survived--until he met a woman whom he felt a connection with--then, he started to live.Chaplin brilliantly explores and satirizes the greatest burden of Man: work. As time flies by quickly, Man finds himself unable to keep up with everything happening around him. He feels lost and defeated, realizing how small and unimportant he is in the society.Chaplin's remedy to this universal problem is simple: positivity. For the simple tramp who always sees the bright side of life thrives and survives. The world is one big comedic act. More than any other film, Modern Times was the first film that made me appreciate the language and beauty of film. It made me a film addict, rummaging through various DVD kiosks, looking for classics, searching for beauty.In our modern times, we are trapped in a fast-paced world, jarring with montages and mountains of images, issues and crises that have been unthought of in the past centuries. But as Charlie Chaplin delivers it plainly at the end of Modern Times, the only way to live through all of this is just to... smile. :)",

There are some heart-string tugging moments as well, because this picture as a real heart to it. It's probably the most emotionally resonant of Chaplin's silent films, with a real emotional payoff. Of course the feature is dated, it is nearly a hundred years old, and there's a bizarre fantasy sequence towards the end that stands out as an odd and unnecessary aside. The piece's silent styling and heightened reality setting allows it to more-or-less totally stand the test of time and provide some honest enjoyment, though.

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin was clearly a true artist- because artists are the observant types who think ahead while everyone is worrying about the now. He was capable of seeing the negatives of advancements in technology long before James Cameron's 'Avatar' would dumb down our views of cinema as to no more than film being just a painting, and the screen its canvas.At first, I wondered why Chaplin would show several hundred sheep wandering toward the opening of the film, until realizing what it was entitled to represent- us. We are seen as cattle. All the men in the opening sequence go to work at the exact same time, all dress in the same outfit, and most of all, live their lives in routine. We often tend to go by the likes of what an authority wants us to do, otherwise without order we are lost.For example, The Tramp is arrested for allegedly \"harassing\" a poor woman, which was a simple misunderstanding resulted from being overworked. He is sent to prison for some time. Once he is released, he does everything in his power to be sent back to jail, because that is where he is most comfortable.The Tramp has difficulty adapting to society and is used to being in a place of the same ol' routine, constantly being told what to do, therefore he cannot make decisions for himself. This is what has happened to society- technology has overpowered us to the point where we have created machines which control human, rather than human controlling the machine.Another aspect I noticed from the film is how the workers and everyone else around use The Tramp as a scapegoat. They blame him each time there is an issue within the factory. Not only so, but the boss also uses him as a guinea pig when testing the feeding machine. He is their favourite outsider, who is simply too trusting and rather clumsy when handling large tasks. This makes it clear where the unique Tim Burton got his inspiration when creating the quirky Edward Scissorhands, another beloved underdog in cinema.When does it end? Where do we put a limit as to how far technology can lead, or will it be like the 2007 Will Smith film \"I Am Legend\", where a lone man is forced to face the results of the world we damaged because of technology? Chaplin was decades ahead of his time when asking such questions. He knew people would be over-dependent toward technology, to the point where one could not survive if their computer broke down.",

It's easy to enjoy the set pieces and Chaplin's physicality. There are many memorable moments, and I was chuckling throughout.Yet, I found The Kid easier to appreciate, particularly when moving back-and-forth between the comedic and sentimental moments. Modern Times felt like vignettes. The Tramp-Gamin relationship had less depth than the Tramp-Kid relationship. The Gamin's frustration in the final scene was also confusing. Did her momentary hopelessness stem from their financial woes or her being chased for her vagrancy charge? I understood it to be mostly the former. Yet, if having their dream home was really so important, why were they so self-destructive, particularly in the department store scene? The ending felt sudden. I left not understanding the characters or the deeper message - if there was one.I understand this was made towards the end of the silent era, and even includes small amounts of spoken dialogue. Are the Tramp's frustrations with technology intended to mirror Chaplin's own sadness with the transition to talkies? There's certainly some kind of commentary about capitalism - particularly in the opening factory scenes and in the labor movement references. Again, not sure if I grasped the full message.I watched this one with the whole family. Everyone liked it, but also felt similarly to me. I'll need to read some reviews to get more context.",

Instead, he was able to craft a relatively simple storyline that allowed him to sling his satirical arrows at the social structures prevalent in the world at that time. And on top of it all, he used his genius slapstick humor to drive these points home.These are the very best types of comedies--ones that make you laugh and are entertaining, but also contain some deeper context about elements of a society just below the surface. It's a refreshing combination to see very funny set pieces (The Tramp trying to serve the man with the roast duck) and scenes where you just marvel at Chaplin's gracefulness (the blindfolded skating scene in the department store) mixed with elements of satirical social commentary (the comparison of a herd of sheep to people going to work by the masses). Especially when compared to the feather-light substance of Chaplin's first short, The Tramp, or even The Jazz Singer, it's remarkable to see American film evolve and develop from a medium whose main goal was to just entertain, into something much smarter and deeper through Modern Times.",

            "content": "The 1936 film, Modern Times, was the end of an era. Well, not exactly. The era was that of silent films, and the end had taken place nine years earlier with the film The Jazz Singer. By the time of Charlie Chaplain's farewell opus to his iconic \"little tramp\" character was released, silent films were out of fashion. The film is a commentary of both Chaplin's distaste for industrialized society and a \"thumbing of the nose\" to the \"talkie\" film as well. Modern Times' writer, director, producer, and actor Chaplin gives his charming \"little tramp\" a fine send-off in a film that is not only thought provoking but hilarious as well.The very first frame of the film shows crowds of workers pressing together to go to work in factories, superimposed over them were droves of sheep being herded. The viewer is then taken into a \"modern\" industrial workplace of controlled chaos. Chaplin works on an assembly line doing the same motion repetitively so that even when he's not working his arms and hand continue their jerking spastic motion that leads to some comical situations. He's later subjected to an automated \"feeding machine\" that goes berserk. The boss keeps an overbearing eye on everything happening in his factory by way of video cameras. Production keeps getting sped up and there's a building pressure to work harder. It doesn't take long before the little tramp has a nervous break-down (hilariously, of course) and is taken to a hospital. Paulette Goddard (who was secretly Chaplin's wife at the time) is introduced as the impoverished, and soon orphaned, female lead. Chaplain, after having been released from the hospital is arrested shortly thereafter under suspicion of being a trade union leader (and you thought you were having a bad day). He's released and he and Goddard meet by chance when she steals a loaf of bread and he tries to take the blame so he can go back to jail. He wants to go back so he wouldn't have to deal with all that was happening in the world around him. Neither ends up in prison and they begin trying to make a life together in a hectic society in which they don't seem to fit. Similar themes, though not presented quite as outright comically, can be found in the Terry Gilliam film Brazil.Though Modern Times was Chaplin's final silent film, there was some sound and even a few spoken parts. Music played an extremely important part from beginning to end. The music (written by Chaplin) reflected the mood of the characters or the situation in which they found themselves involved. Sound effects were also prevalent. Some were simple sounds of machines, or comic noises used to enhance some comedic situation. The spoken parts in the film were very few. Of those few, all but one of them came from inhuman things such as a radio, a recording, or the factory boss speaking on a large screen.Modern Times was a great farewell to a motion picture icon. Both poignant and witty, the film makes you laugh and think. Many, if not all, of the societal issues Chaplain touched upon are still around today almost 75 years later. The \"little tramp\" that never seemed to fit in anywhere was able to sing his first and last song on film, get the girl, and walk off into the sunset.",

            "content": "Yes, I know that Modern Times were not Chaplin's first attempt at drama (the first one was A Woman of Paris, that did not go well with the critics or the audience, and the poor Chaplin even had to apologize for trying out something honest!), but it is his first successful and winning formula of smuggling a drama in the disguise as a comedy. While even City Lights showed Chaplin in a dramatic role, Modern Times seems to me, even today, as primary a dramatic, tragic film about the Great Depression, and only secondary as a comedy. Bear with me, I am aware that there are a lot of laughs in this one, yet watching the movie as a whole, as a context, they seem to be there to at least keep a little will for life in the otherwise bitter, sad and depressing story. Heck, even the ending is revealing.Chaplin here plays his iconic Tramp, except that this time practically half of all the characters in the movie can be labeled as such - bums, poverty, unemployment, poor living conditions, the story is even more relevant today after the 2008 financial crisis. Heck, you could screen this at the shelters, the people would identify with this for sure. Chaplin was rich, but he came from a very poor family and never forgot how it is to work hard for a living. He was aware of the changes in the society and how millions of people were struggling to survive, so he channeled their frustration into this movie, a warning to the people in charge to do something. Things eventually improved, only to just recently get back to a state Chaplin was warning all along. Modern Times are a classic of unobtrusive social commentary, an ironic tragedy where technology - instead of making jobs easier for the people - just made them work even more, and the wages were so low you could not afford to live. Inside Job (2010) or Capitalism: A Love Story (2009) cannot even hold a candle to this. The sequence where Chaplin is frantically trying to keep up with a production line, tightening bolts, may not be as iconic or recognizable as his 'shoe dance' in The Gold Rush, but it is way more identifiable and easier to connect with the daily life, at least for me.",

But along with a homeless young woman he is able to face every challenge that comes on his way and able to enjoy life.The movie when compared with modern day comedies, differs a lot. In-fact the modern day comedy producers should learn from watching movies like \"Modern Times\". The movie doesn't contain any profanity and sex at all unlike many comedies seen nowadays. However without any of these modern techniques of making people laugh, \"Modern Times\" is still able to make people burst out of laughter.Though it is a silent movie, it keep the viewers engaged in it for almost 90 minutes and makes sure that they get something for their lives at the end of it. It teaches how to enjoy life despite all the obstacles life bring along its way.Overall, this is one of the best comedies ever produced and will stay the same in centuries to come. So, don't hesitate to have a go at it even-though it is produced black and white. It will surely keep you entertained and is a movie that the whole family could watch together.",

The movie kicks off with a harsh comment on modern society as Chaplin combines a shot of sheep with people pouring out of the underground. A nice detail is the black sheep, which can be seen as a reference to the outsider (Chaplin) The strongest points of the film are the visual gags. Chaplin plays with his audience and opens every register of his acting-skills.Technically he uses a variety of shot-techniques without making them too prominent. Especially the fluidity of the movie comes to mind. Notice how he lets scenes intermingle by echoing the pose of the actor. The directing skill can also be detected in the way he avoids the problems connected with filming in black and white:we know the colour of the flag Chaplin is carrying is red, because it was attached to a truck with an extended load. The weak points are that he isn't able to keep up the pace all through the movie. Also his critique on society is not very sharp, and the end is moralizing and too positive. Nice detail: Chaplin's comment on the talkies. He sings a song with nonsensical lyrics, to prove that suggestion is as strong or even stronger than the real thing",

In Modern Tines, Charlie Chaplain attempts to portray the industrial and technological boom and evoke feelings of resentment for governments and the sponsors of industry by use of satire, comedy, and drama. Although Modern Times is a near-silent film, the core themes, mainly industrial progression and the idealistic deterioration of society, spoke volumes during the Great Depression and even in present day.Modern Times by Charlie Chaplain was the first box office comedy released in the 1930s and perhaps the most marvelous of Chaplain's illustrious works in the 1930s and 1940s. There are several prevalent themes in the movie, the first one being the adverse effects of industrialization and technology. The second is the redundant nature of life as result of technology and over reliance on industry. The third major theme of the movie is the hardships faced by the lower classes during the Great Depression. The major bias presented in the movie is that technology and industry is overwhelmingly negative and will contribute to the downfall of American society.Charlie Chaplain's beliefs lean to the extreme left of the 1930s and 1940s which shared common ideology with Marx and the Communist Revolution. Many Americans felt that American society could not progress in an age dominated by machinery and technology. Chaplain's efforts to downplay the benefits of technology fall short of success because his notions and assertions are depicted on the big screen and not in real life. While the main character was supposed to represent the typical factory working residing in one of the many up and coming suburban areas of the US, the main character was viewed by many critics as a degenerate that was not able to conform to the new standards of society. Even though Chaplain includes plenty of satire, he attempts to contradict the thoughts and notions of modern times by portraying the downfall of the main character. Nonetheless, the film provided much needed comical relief in an age dominated by poverty and hardship.",

This immediately makes one imagine that the humans are exactly like the pigs being led to slaughter, but the slaughter the humans are facing, or so the film espouses, is the slaughter of their individuality. The movie shows all of the workers in the factory toiling very hard to keep up with their grinding jobs as the factory owner sits on his rear and has breakfast and relaxes as he watches the workers through a closed circuit television system. He constantly is forcing the workers to work harder for the same pay. One of the most interesting things done in the movie is having the thing selling the automatic feeding machine be a machine itself. This shows a glimpse into our own future commenting on machines taking our jobs like most jobs at car factories are now done by robots. The factory owner tries out the automatic feeding machine on the factory worker, hoping that the machine would allow him to stretch his worker's days even longer by ending the lunch break. This shows the rich, the factory owner, exploiting the poor, the factory worker, and how the rich continue to get richer on the backs of the poor. Eventually the stress of it all takes its toll on the factory worker and he cracks. The themes of modernization ripping away individuality, the rich exploiting the poor, and individuality sticking out in a bad way continue throughout the movie. You at once laugh at the factory workers exploits but at the same time feel his pain. The comedy shows a less depressing way to look at the problems allowing for a hopeful view for tomorrow and the possibility of finding solutions. The movie has great meaning even today about the injustices of modernization.",

            "content": "\"Who's that goofy looking man with the over-sized suit stuck in that machine?\" One would ask catching a glimpse of Charlie Chaplain's Modern Times (1927). Charlie Chaplain, bent and contorted between gears and sprockets, provokes laughs as well as thoughtful insight into man's relationship with technology. This film entices one to consider the conflict between the human body and machines.To stimulate thoughts on man's relationship with machines, Modern Times places the main character, a happy-go-lucky factory worker who inadvertently finds trouble with the law and has difficulty keeping a job, in a variety of awkward situations. In telling his story, the movie exposes themes surrounding industrialization, unemployment, and social stratification. These themes reflect the movie's main point that industrialization can lead to unemployment and a stratified social structure.Industrialization is a major theme in the movie. At a factory, it is obvious that machines play a large role. In fact, it seems that the men are secondary to the machines. The workers do their work based on what the machines do; a machine is even brought in to feed the workers. This is apparent during the main character's struggle to keep up with an ornery conveyor belt. Eventually, the main character finds himself sucked into the machine. Watching a man surrounded by the inner workings of the machine, one cannot help but reflect on the ubiquitous nature of machines in society. Although the machines are helpful, their presence causes hardship amongst many.The increasing use of machines is depicted in the film as a chief cause of unemployment. While trying to find work, Chaplain's character experiences the hardships caused by vast unemployment. A young female friend of his personifies the struggle endured by many who could not find work. The machines are directly connected to unemployment through a newspaper clipping. The clipping reads, \"Factories Open: Men returning to work.\" Were it not for the machines in these factories, men would have no work, but one must remember that it was the machines who put them out of work in the first place.The movie goes on to suggest that machines have stratified society. While many suffer from unemployment because of the machines, others thrive. The president of the factory provides the best example of this. He sits in his office doing puzzles and occasionally shouting an order through a machine. While his workers exert themselves and others starve on the streets, this man has benefited greatly because of machines.Through these themes, one notices the constant conflict between man and machine. Chaplain's character struggles against conveyor belts and escalators and suffers at the hands of an uncontrollable feeding machine. While in a constant struggle with machines not to be replaced, man finds himself in need of them as well. They make his life easier in some cases. Although produced seventy years ago, the social commentary provided in this film raises pertinent questions for today. As machines become \"smarter\" and more useful, how can man maintain his value?",

            "content": "Movie Review: Modern Times The movie Modern Times provides a funny point of view about the unemployed people. Charles Chaplin characterizes an unemployed person who tries to stay in jail for life. At the beginning of the movie, he is wrongfully accused of communist and stayed in jail. One day after he is in jail, some inmates try to escape, but Chaplin killed them and saved the policemen's lives. As a result, he is freed from jail. However, he does not want to leave. He did not have a home or place to live. When he left the jail, he met a girl who is also unemployed and poor. He tried to get back to jail, but the girl gets him out of jail. After a couple of weeks, he found a job as a night watchman for a department store. However, he felt sleep at his job and was put back in jail. While he was in jail, the girl found a job as a dancer. After he left jail, he finds a job as a waiter and singer, but the police finds them and they escaped. Finally, they decide to move to another city to find new adventures.The music adds a special touch to the movie. Even though there are hardly any words, the few sentences that are pronounced or written in the movie helps the audience keep up with the story. It is a beautiful story where two people meet and fall in love. They are both poor, but with each other's help they decide to continue and try new adventures. I would have liked to see a happier ending where both will have found a steady job and bought a house.",

            "content": "Modern Times (1936), filmed between 1932 and 1936, it was directed, written, and produced by Charlie Chaplin. This was Chaplin's first film after his successful City Lights (1931). This film is Charlie Chaplin's protest against what is lost from silent films through the sound industry revolutionizing the film industry. There is no traditional voice dialogue in the film - but voices and sounds do originate from machines (e.g., the feeding machine), television screens (i.e., the authoritarian on the screen in the lavatory), and Chaplin's actual voice is heard singing as well as special sound effects are used. Set during the Great Depression, the movie's main concern reflected the millions of Americans in the era - joblessness, destitution, and famine. It had a number of marvelous and memorable scenes that showed the frustrating relationship between man and machine in the Industrial Age and social institutions. The scenes of the Chaplin's character Tramp is alternated between scenes as a factory worker, a shipyard worker, a night watchman, a singing waiter, or a criminal put in jail. The Tramp also deals with various authority figures during his abuses: a 'Big Brother' factory boss, a minister, juvenile authorities, a sheriff, a shipyard foreman, a store manager, etc. Under the overlaid credits, a clock face approaches 6 o'clock. The preface explains the film's topic: \"'Modern Times.' A relationship between industry, and individual enterprise - humanity exploring a median between efficiency and happiness.\" The film starts with an overhead shot of a flock of sheep crowding their enclosure, and rushed through a shaft. Instantly, sheep dissolve into a related overhead shot of industrial workers pushing out of a subway station on their way to work in a factory during their commute. Modern Times by Charlie Chaplin is a milestone film, showing numerous changes in Chaplin's film making. It is also one of Chaplin's most famous films. It contains quite a few first attempts by Charlie Chaplin. It is Chaplin's movie used to make a social remark. It introduced Paulette Goddard, his partner both on & off screen. It is his first true talking film; in keeping with the movie's topic of the dehumanization of society, all of the voices in the film came from non-living sources (radios, a phonograph record, etc.)",

            "content": "Change the film to color, update the wardrobe, give everyone speaking parts, and you got yourself a movie one might think came out last Friday. Modern Times is a whimsical tale of an unlucky man, struggling with the oppressive, impersonal nature of technology and the unattainable \"American Dream\". Evidence of the film's negative take on technology can be seen in the automated lunch feeder, for which the owner of the factory reluctantly agrees to a demo, in hopes of cutting the costs of needless \"break time\". The machine inevitably fails and ironically, produces more problems taking up more of the worker's time. Another example is the assembly line, which could arguably be one of the most revolutionary technologies ever made. The assembly line, which requires a worker to know only one piece of the puzzle, thus making the worker replaceable, is portrayed in this movie as mind numbing and monotonous. Even after the worker is finished, he continues the physical motions until he zones back in to reality. If this film were made today, instead of an assembly line we might see cubicles and their anti-social effects on the employee. Maybe there's a scene where an employee requests an icon in \"cornflower blue\". Or maybe there's a scene that shows the pointlessness of staff meetings and how nothing gets done. Actually, updated versions of this movie have been made. All three scenarios are found in Office Space, Fight Club and the television show, The Office. Although the US is now an information/services economy, the ideal business is still seen as running like a well-oiled machine. Eliminating inefficient practices by maximizing employee output and eliminating service gaps. Although Modern Times is a comedy, specifically physical comedy, the message the creator is trying to send is clear. The negative effects of industrialization portrayed in this film are poignant and moving. These \"modern times\" only benefit a select few, those at the top. Maybe physical comedy was the creator's only way of getting his message across, knowing that if his film was a serious piece, he might have been ostracized, perhaps worse.John V. Govt. 490",

Unemployment was extremely high and many families struggled to get food on their dinner tables. The world's economy was in shambles and many countries were on the verge of war in 1936 when Charlie Chaplin released his silent comedic movie \"Modern Times\". Just as many of Chaplin's movies he directed, produced and starred in this comedic masterpiece. Similar to his past movies Chaplin uses his \"little tramp\" character to illustrate the different trials and tribulations many men and women where facing during that time. This is one of Chaplin's first political themed movies. \"Modern Times\" is a story in which still relates to our everyday lives. As technology improves there will always be people similar to the little tramp character of \"Modern Times\", just not as hilarious as Chaplin's antics. This hilarious movie follows the Little Tramp as he attempts to find means to survive. Once he is laid off from his factory he is mistakenly identified as a communist protest leader, and quickly incarcerated. The hijiinks continue for the Little Tramp within the prison walls, one such instance was when he mistakenly consumed cocaine during lunch. As soon as the cocaine hits his system lunch is over and the prisoners must return to their cells, while he is being transported from one room to another a prison break erupts and he is once again thrown into the middle of an intense situation and he has no idea. Unknowingly he breaks up the prison break and is award for his brave actions with a pardon, once again he is free man, and however he is still broke, hungry, and homeless. Determined to get imprisoned again where he will receive three meals and a place to stay becomes his number one priority. Instantly his dream to be imprisoned again comes true as a young orphan girl whom is also dearly struggling to survive is caught stealing and as she fled from the police she ran into The little Tramp. He quickly takes the blame for the theft and is arrested. Once released from jail he his re-introduced to the young girl whom had escaped the police. The two of them immediately create a bond between them and vow to do whatever they have to do to survive. Chaplin eventually returns to work at the factory, and even though he's really not good at anything he still makes a valiant effort. His factory career doesn't last long before the workers go back on strike; once again he's unemployed and hungry. He eventually gets a job as a server/ entertainer at a local caf\u00e9 where his young friend is performing at. Similar to all his other professions, Chaplin is thrown into the hectic lifestyle that was prevailing at the time. The increased industrialization and modernization was a huge conflict for The Little Tramp, whom was incapable of adapting. Ultimately he finds his calling, without the intrusion of technology he perfects his natural calling of an entertainer.",

It is easy for all of us to express what we think, feel, and are concerned of by simply opening our mouth and speaking out, but Chaplin shows us that the ability to communicate with the other actors and the audience can be accomplished not only by the verbal speech, but also by the body language and our inner intentions. In the movie \"Modern Times\", he gives us a show of his sarcasm towards the fast-paced technology and the inability to catch up with the modernization in the world he lives in. The technology he describes and is concerned of supposedly should help us in our daily tasks as well as improve our life for the better; miserably it not only creates difficulties for him, but also makes it emotionally unbearable for him to deal with. He tries to be as fast as he could be when screwing in the nuts of the machines; he tries to adjust his attitude and physical body to perform and give his one hundred percent, but unfortunately he is left with disappointment when catching up with the rapid environment he is surrounded by. His skills and mind become rusty as he works only on one part of the assembly line over and over again like a robot without a break. His body is beaten- up from work and there is either no excitement at the work place or no direct benefits from the technological advancement. He tries to work hard and by the acceptable norms of the society, but his happiness is diminished as his soul and his inner self suffocate by the cruel demands from the management of the factory he works at. His dedication to accomplish his work requirements creates not only a problem for his co-workers and his superiors when slowing down the factory production, but also creates a nervous break for himself that only makes him physically and mentally weak and vulnerable when he foolishly plays around and annoys others by spraying them with machine oil. Throughout the movie Chaplin shows to us the dysfunctions of the new technology and he sadly transforms the difficult moments in his work career into comic laughter for the audiences. The situations he develops in front of our eyes make us question the advantages much argued and discussed to us about the positive influence of the new machinery. Back then human persona suffer to adjust to the new world which created obstacles and frustrations with the technology. The humanity was challenged by the new and changing future of the technological expansion. The movie shows us different unexpected scenes and aspects that the working class was dealing with at the times of scientific adaptation. Was it worth it or not for the human race to pass through the discomfort and discontent that the future had in store? Deeper insights are needed when conducting a formal or informal research on the case. Chaplin acts astonishingly in order to maintain his view for the present and future evolution concerning the human attempts to improve and benefit the society; and the movie brings us to our senses in observing the reality of the advantages and disadvantages in the new worldly- and quickly- changing technology.",

            "content": "Modern TimesThe Tramp, a fictional character created by Charlie Chaplin, made his final screen debut in 1936 in the silent film Modern Times. Released after talkie movies had gained popularity, the film was directed in a classic silent film style with limited use of dialogue. By going against the newest technology, Chaplin creates a comedic story about the problems an average man has with technology. Modern Times is a reflection of Chaplin's believed that advances in technology, in particular adding sound to film, did not add to the average man's life in a significant way. Using advances in technology to highlight how progress could be detrimental to the average man by separating him from both physically and emotionally from others and creating a wider barrier separating the wealthy from an easily replaceable poor man. Chaplin's use of limited dialogue provided the best example of separation and isolation individual experiences as result of advancing technology. Most evident in two scenes in the original factory, the manager speaks to the workers on a screen from a distance place and the use of a recorded salesman to demonstrate the feeding machine. This creates a barrier between the actual speaker and those the information is being conveyed to. The removal of human interaction from the voices represents the isolation and feeling of man being replaceable. The wide barrier between the wealthy and the poor is highlighted by how the social classes use the technology. The poor are shown needing the technology to live but the wealthy is shown to have technology to help them, best shown by the manager's use of the radio in opening scenes. In contrast, the tramp rushes out on breakfast when the newspaper advertises the need for workers at a new factory. Hundreds of workers are cramped together like sheep, herding forward to gain employment. The actual hiring is based on the number of people needed not that actual skills or knowledge needed for a position. The ideal of all men created equal is quickly replaced, as poor men are replaceable because of technology. Originally written during the Great Depression Chaplin's story is still relevant seventy years later. Advances in technology have resulted in man feeling more isolated as computers and i-pods replace human interaction. The fast paced society of today is simplified in Modern Times as corporations continue to view workers as replaceable and trying to make workers able to do more by being more efficient.",

            "content": "Said BarodiCharlie Chaplin And a Look at Our Own Modern TimesOnce again I get to enjoy watching Charlie Chaplin's master piece Modern Times. The movie possesses this quality that I can interpret it in many different ways according to the events prevailing in periods during which I watched it. The movie could be interpreted politically, artistically, socially and technologically. It possesses these prophetic and futuristic visions of the world we live in today. But this time, as I watch Modern Times again, it came at a very interesting period in my generation's lifetime which is the worst economic crisis since the depression of the thirties. Watching Modern Times reminded me that our economy hasn't learned the lessons taught by the depression of the thirties and that if we don't shape up the economy we might as well be heading for another one soon. As I watched the movie I couldn't stop thinking about my last tour in the state of Michigan with my in-laws. During my last visit to Michigan I watched the iconic state of United States economic power disintegrate in front of my eyes. They were abandoned houses everywhere in Detroit, lines of jobless people lining up in front of day labor spots and unemployment offices. The infrastructure of the city is falling apart, rust everywhere from abandoned factories to bridges. Roads were filled with pot holes. The iconic towers of GM simply looked miserable and macabre; the State of Michigan was dying. As we all followed on the news for the last few months, the iconic state of Michigan was falling apart as the big three, Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler were preparing to file for bankruptcy and were laying off thousands of their workers and shutting down many factories and dealerships. The chain reaction from the fall was not limited to Michigan or to the auto industry, it was everywhere, it was nationwide. When I watched Modern Times again it gave me another insight as to what happened exactly, or part of what I believe happened. As Charlie Chaplin carries on his monotonic and tedious task of screwing two bolts to a part moving fast on a mechanized belt, I thought about the generations upon generations of blue collar workers who were brought up in an industrial culture that supremely valued efficiency to the point it neglected the human factor in the production chain. Generations of blue collar workers who where brought up in the auto industry of Michigan and other industries that use the same production methods as those portrayed by Charlie Chaplin in Modern Times. The results were disastrous every time an economic crisis hit, the industry produced hordes of unskilled workers who received no cross training or opportunity to advance within those industries in a way that would allow them to compete and obtain jobs in case they were laid off. The monotonic tasks immensely limited the workers' creativity and skill level to the point were they became solely reliant on the same employer and work place and unable to adapt to economic and industrial changes such as recessions and outsourcing. I believe that Charlie Chaplin's critic of the efficiency-above-all model of production is time-proof and still applies to our own modern times. It is time to restructure the US industry in a way that it puts emphasis on the human factor and instills ingenuity and creativity in the American worker.",

            "content": "Charlie Chaplin's \"Modern Times\" was released on February 25, 1936. This film would be Chaplin's last silent film. Charlie Chaplin reprises his role as the Tramp in this film set during the Great Depression. Chaplin continues his mastery of silent theatric humor in this film, whose storyline many people would have a hard time finding humor in. This film is fittingly produced in black and white. Modern Times is based in the midst of the Great Depression. The main theme of the film is to make the viewer aware of the conditions of the Depression and how they affected most people. This film raises our awareness of issues such as poor work conditions, unemployment, poverty, hunger, and the harsh reality of broken families during this time in history. Charlie Chaplin plays the Tramp who recently becomes unemployed after having a nervous breakdown, as a result of being worked too hard. The Tramp struggles to find and keep a job in these tough times. Discouraged, he resorts to trying to get thrown in jail so he has a place to sleep and food to eat. During his attempts to go back to jail, the Tramp meets the Garmin, played by Paulette Goddard. The Garmin is a young runaway orphan who recently lost her family, as a result of her father being shot in the street. The Garmin and the Tramp are now homeless, hungry and poor. They come find hope in each other and find a new determination to survive together and beat the odds. This film follows their struggle to overcome the odds, earn an honest living, keep nourished and maintain hope throughout all of the obstacles they encounter. Charlie Chaplin wrote, directed, composed and produced this film. Chaplin's masterful use of sound draws the viewer into the scene. In this film, sound is vital in establishing mood and atmosphere of scenes. One defining scene in the film that is a perfect example is a scene where the Garmin loses her father. The Garmin and her sisters are on the dock collecting wood (happy, joyous music is heard), next a gunshot is heard and the music becomes frantic. The Garmin sends her sisters off and she rushes to see what happened. She arrives at her father lying in the street and takes him in her hands as the music turns sad and she mourns her father's death while holding him in her hands. Chaplin also uses masterful body language to portray the emotion and tempo of the film. This is a vital component to this film, like so many other silent films. One good example of this is when the Garmin and Tramp are sitting on the side of the road. The Garmin suddenly comes to tears and dramatically places her head in her arm to cry on. The Tramp and the audience are fully aware of her mood at that moment. This films overall theme is similar to that of Cinderella Man. Even though these films were produced about 70 years apart, they share a theme. Regardless of the circumstances you are dealt, you should never give up. While Cinderella Man is based on a true story of the Great Depression period, Modern Times is based on Charlie Chaplin's unique portrayal of the period. I would strongly recommend viewing this movie to gain a better understanding of this period in American History.",

Although I have yet to see all of his performances, this one so far is the best that I have seen. Not completely a silent movie due to sound effects and an added sound track yet still delivers the same charm and eloquence, and again Chaplin puts his signature comic styling together with compelling social commentary. In this film, Chaplin's character, The Tramp, is mainly a factory worker, yet he takes on many roles from factory worker, to ship hand, even an extremely happy occupant in the city jail. Of course at the time this movie was set, jail was at times the best place to be and The Tramp tries many times during the film to return to the jail where he was the most comfortable. Set in the depression, this film is Chaplin's protest against industrialization and modern advancements. It also shows what life was like during that time in American history.During the film, The Tramp is accompanied by The Gamin, a homeless girl portrayed by Paulette Goddard. The two characters meet while the Gamin is stealing bread and runs into Tramp while trying to escape. Different plot points throughout the film involve the two characters, who eventually fall in love. There are many other lively characters in the film, from the co-workers at the factory to the inmates at the jail, all of whom play into and off of Chaplin's talents. Keeping with the theme of man against establishment, the characters that Tramp interacts with run the gambit. He has run-ins with many different authority figures such a factory boss, a minister, a sheriff, a shipyard boss, and different managers. All of these people Tramp saw as the source for all his problems, but even with the string of bad luck, Tramp as always makes the best of the situation. A central motif or repeated idea in the film is common working man versus the establishment. No matter how hard he may or in some instances not try, he gets shot down, is brought back up and is shot down again. This film is Chaplin's rage against the industrialized age, and against the ones in charge of it. This idea remains prevalent throughout the entire film.Another technique that is quite interestingly used in this silent film was the use of sound. Even though this was a silent movie, it did have a soundtrack. Some of the characters have voice overs, and there is a singing track in the cafe scene. The song the Tramp sings is interesting to say the least. I am not sure if it was his voice they used, if it were, it was the only time I have ever heard it, but it worked very well and was an interesting tune.Well although not of the same genre, Modern Times theme is reminiscent of a movie I watched called Metropolis (1927). This film was set in the future but carried the same premise which is basically man versus the establishment. Not sure why Modern Times reminded me of it, Metropolis is an old film and a lot of it was lost,but the general theme is the same. Not saying that Modern Times is a socialist movie, but it was filled with much social commentary on the time.There are ideas in Modern Times that I generally do not agree with, but for the comedic value Chaplin does it again. The industrial revolution has brought great wealth, and yes great poverty. Chaplin adds those characteristics of good and evil with his vast talents and weaves out a movie that manages not only to encourage thought of the times he lived but bring a smile and a laugh to a time when there really was not much to laugh at. Well done Charlie, The Tramp lives on.",
