            "content": "My favorite Bogart movie is also Key Largo. Even before Edward G. Robinson and his hoods take everyone hostage in Lionel Barrymore's hotel there is a tension that does not let up for one second. Movie goers had to be on the edge of their seats in 1948.There is one scene however that I don't think viewers today can fully appreciate. Lionel Barrymore had been acting from a wheelchair for 10 years and movie audiences were used to that. When Robinson and his goons goad him to a futile gesture of bravado, Barrymore rises from that chair and moves slowly towards the snickering Robinson. He swings and misses and falls down and Bogey and Bacall pick up Barrymore and bring him back to his wheelchair. The shock value of that scene for 1948 audiences would have a dimension that can't be appreciated now.Robinson's Johnny Rocco is based on Lucky Luciano who had been deported a few years back. He's evil incarnate and Humphrey Bogart as Frank McCloud is the jaded, cynical former idealist who redeems himself and becomes the countervailing force for good. They play well against each other in a reverse from the 1930s Warner gangster flicks where Robinson was usually the good guy.Who could have known this would be the fourth, last, and best of the Bogey and Bacall teamings.",

            "review_title": "Post World War II pessimism !!!",
            "content": "John Huston's 'Key Largo' is set in a Post World War II America and the film is unapologetic about showcasing the pessimism that had enveloped America and Americans after the war. It's about the loss of a self-respecting identity. This is epitomised by the character of Frank McCloud played by Humphrey Bogart. This is not a very characteristic role for Bogart. McCloud is a war veteran who has now become a homeless drifter due to his lack of interest in a settled life. He is a sane version of Travis Bickle, he might have been a vibrant, hopeful man in his pre-service days, but after coming back from the war and watching an America that has further collapsed into corruption, mob activity and evil, he has slipped into a state of depression and deliberate indifference. Bogart gives a subdued performance with moments of tenderness reminiscent of the tenderness of Rick Blaine in 'Casablanca'. But McCloud also shows signs of selfishness and cowardly reluctance which are a consequence of his pessimism towards life after war. There is an ambiguity to his character that makes him interesting.Lauren Bacall doesn't give us the quintessential 'Lauren Bacall' performance either. Instead of being the 'Femme fatale' with the seductive allure and the sharp tongue, her character Nora is a sweet, kind-hearted widow taking care of her father-in-law. There are genuinely sweet and charming moments between Bogart and Bacall. Nora's presence and her innocent sweetness has an undeniable effect on McCloud which makes him reconsider his moral stance and contemplate the idea doing something instead of continuing his reluctance about standing up to the gangsters.Edward G. Robinson is a dynamite in every scene he is in. Johnny Rocco oozes charisma and a sense of control. It takes a lot to be in the same scene with Bogart and go toe to toe with him in terms of exuding authoritativeness, but Robinson does it effortlessly.Although Huston doesn't use too many attention seeking shots or too much fancy camera work, one can easily see the noir-ish elements in the lighting and prominent shadows in the film. There are some carefully used tracking shots and extreme close-ups for artistic purposes that work perfectly and the film on Blu-Ray looks very pleasing to the eye. Huston's biggest achievement is maintaining a tone of suspense throughout the running time. The staging of 90 percent of the film in the confines of the interiors of Hotel Largo adds to the claustrophobia which the viewer feels along with McCloud, Nora and Temple. The only flaw is that the shootout scenes are very clumsily directed and almost look comical now after all these years.'Key Largo' is thematically a film which wrestles the idea of whether someone should or shouldn't give a damn even if he/she feels an assertive action doesn't mean much in the bigger picture. A thematically potent core along with good direction and acting make 'Key Largo' an easy recommendation.",

            "content": "Key Largo is a remote island off the coast of Florida. It's connected to the mainland by a concrete causeway. Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) goes there to visit the father of a dead army buddy. He meets him (Lionel Barrymore) and his buddies widow (Lauren Bacall). He also discovers criminal Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) is holed up there with his gang and alcoholic girlfriend (Claire Trevor). A hurricane hits and they're all stranded on the island together...and Johnny and his gang have guns and nasty tempers...Bogart and Bacall's last movie together and a good one too. This was based on a play and it sometimes shows. Characters tend to give long speeches explaining who they are and their motivations. Still it's well-written and acted and beautifully directed by John Huston. When the hurricane hits the special effects are actually pretty good with cool sound effects too.The acting is (with one exception) good. Bogart seemed incapable of giving a bad performance and he's just great here. Robinson doesn't show up until nearly 30 minutes in--but you always know he's there. He's OK but I think he played the gangster role once too often. Barrymore is given little to do but he is good. Trevor is superb in her small role--she understandably won a Best Supporting Actress award for this. Surprisingly Bacall is terrible! She's stone faced throughout and gives a bad performance. Maybe she didn't click with the director (Huston was not known for his tact and tended to be a screamer).Still it's a good solid drama--worth catching. I give it an 8.",

            "review_title": "Enduring Warner Gangster Melodrama.",
            "content": "One of the finest of the great gangster melodramas KEY LARGO is still a firm favourite with fans and cultists alike. Produced by Jerry Wald in 1948 for Warner Bros. it was based on the stage play by Maxwell Anderson and was beautifully written for the screen by Richard Brooks and John Huston. Stunningly photographed in low key black & white by Karl Freund it was expertly directed with his customary flair by Huston. The cast assembled couldn't be better with Humphrey Bogart delivering one of his very best subdued performances and arguably being almost eclipsed by a riveting Ed. G. Robinson. The rest of the small cast is fleshed out with Lauren Bacall, Lionel Barrymore, Claire Trevor and Thomas Gomez. And complimenting the on screen proceedings is the splendid music by the tireless Max Steiner who provided one of his best forties scores. It is 1946, the war in Europe is over and a returning GI (Humphrey Bogart) arrives at The Largo Hotel in Key Largo. Asked who he is Bogart coolly replies \"McCloud, Frank by John out of Helen\". He is here to meet with the hotel owner John Temple (Lionel Barrymore) to talk about the death of his son George Temple and how he lost his life in combat in Italy saving his unit. But McCloud notices that also staying in the hotel are a undesirable crowd of sinister looking characters. It's not long before he learns that they are a gang of mobsters led by an abrasive deported racketeer - the infamous Johnny Rocco (Robinson). When McCloud reveals who Rocco is and lists his many illegal and crooked enterprises the aging wheelchair bound John Temple gloweringly chides him \"You Filth\" which elicits little more than a snigger from Rocco. Then the gang declare themselves and display their violent ways (they murder the deputy sheriff) and make known their intention to force McCloud to sail them to Cuba. However after Rocco's moll (Claire Trevor) slips McCloud a gun he takes them on in a surprise move out at sea which makes for an intense and exciting sequence. The picture ends with McCloud's dispatch of the baddies and turning the boat around he heads back to Key Largo and The Largo Hotel where a new life awaits him.With some remarkable ensemble playing performances are top notch. Bogart gives one of his best portrayals in a likable reserved manner. Here proving yet again that he remains one of the most enduring icons of the silver screen. But there's little doubt KEY LARGO is Robinson's picture! His snarling and totally mean spirited Rocco is the best thing he has ever done. Good too are those in support especially Lionel Barrymore as the irascible aging hotelier, Lauren Bacall as Nora his daughter in-law and Claire Trevor giving a great turn as Rocco's moll in her Acadamy Award winning best supporting actress performance.And holding the whole thing together is Max Steiner's great score. His main theme is a lovely gentle anthem-like cue which points up the sadness of George Temple's death in the war and the loneliness now felt without him by his father and widow Nora. Also heard are some great action cues and an appropriate swirling piece for the Hurricane sequence. 1948 was a bumper year for the busy composer. In twelve months the man scored an unprecedented eleven films which included such amazing classics as \"Treasure Of The Sierra Madre\", \"Johnny Belinda\", \"Silver River\" the exceptional \"The Adventures Of Don Juan\" and of course KEY LARGO.KEY LARGO remains a memorable and enduring classic from Hollywood's Golden Age. In the tradition of the great noirs it exudes an engaging dramatic thrust throughout and an all encompassing intensity rarely felt in movies today. John Huston demonstrated yet again his prowess as one of film's outstanding directors and with his inspired casting in KEY LARGO the movie will forever maintain its appeal as long as there are movies and a place to screen them..Footnote: It is interesting to note that the boat used in the final sequence was Bogart's own boat \"The Santana\".",

            "content": "People often criticize this movie for really not being much more than a filmed play. Yeah! So what's wrong with that when the characters are three dimensional and the actors are brilliant. This movie gets dull only when it moves out of the hotel (the stage) and becomes a traditional action movie. The black and white photography is brilliant (I once saw it colorized and it was dreadful). The production design is perfectly honest. The direction is so clear and unpretentious; when you have faces as brilliant as these, you gotta take advantage of closeups. There is not one less than outstanding performance. Bacall's role doesn't call for her to do a lot of \"acting\" and as a result, she is very moving. Trevor had tough competition for her Oscar that year and she won because she understood that too much restraint would have been wrong yet she never goes too far. Bsrrymore is unusually tough and commanding, almost heroic against the thugs. Bogart is quiet and direct and when he gives Trevor her drink has the most powerful moment in the movie. Robinson? It is a real showy role, and Edward knew what not to do. He is savage. And he almost is sexy when he gets Claire to sing her song but he can revert to a monster within seconds and give the audience chills. It really is his movie. Gomez and his fellow stupid thugs are funny at times but the script is unusually honest and barbaric. Take away their guns and these guys are wimps. But why didn't they just stay in the hotel? The shootout at the end could have been done that way. The escape to Cuba isn't believable or compelling. Those who call this movie slow, just don't get it. They don't understand that artists use pacing for effect. Today's generation loving special effects and action and over-the-top acting will hate this movie. Their loss. And the loss for the future of film and theatre.",

            "review_title": "Edward G. Robinson at this best",
            "content": "Key Largo is just one of John Huston's many memorable films that somehow always seem to transcend the intention--the Hollywood intention being to make a few bucks--and to this day still plays very well and indeed appears as something close to a work of art. It features what I think is one of Edward G. Robinson's finest performances as Johnny Rocco, a sociopathic gangster holding the off-season personnel of a seaside hotel hostage as he concludes a counterfeit money deal.The story begins as Major Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) pays a visit to the family of one of his G.I. buddies who was killed in Italy during WWII. He finds the welcome from the hotel's only \"guests\" chilly except for Gaye Dawn (a funny and perhaps prescient Hollywood stage name) played by Claire Trevor who is drunk and befriends him. After a bit McCloud discovers that the hotel's owner Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall) and her invalid father-in-law James Temple (Lionel Barrymore) have been tricked into allowing Rocco's gang to stay and now, as a tropical storm begins to blow, are being held at gunpoint. McCloud's delicate task is to keep the megalomaniac and murderous personality of Rocco under some control so that he doesn't murder everyone.Note that this is a splendid cast, and they all do a good job. Note too that Huston adapted this from a play by the versatile American playwright Maxwell Anderson. So the ingredients for a good film are clearly in place; and aside from some self-conscious mishmash with the Seminoles of Florida, this is a success. Anderson's desire to explore the psychopathic personality (some years later he adapted William March's novel The Bad Seed into a stage play) finds realization in Huston's direction and especially in Robinson's indelible performance. The utter disregard for the lives of others and the obsessive love of self that characterize the sociopath reek from the snares and callous laughter of the very sick Johnny Rocco. I especially liked the crazed and thrilled grin on his face when he emerges from the hold of the boat in the climactic scene, gun in hand, imagining that he has once again fooled his adversaries and is about to delightfully shoot Humphrey Bogart to death. What I loved about this scene was that Huston did not think it necessary to contrive a fight in which the good guy (Bogart) beats the bad guy by fighting fair. What happens is exactly what should happen, and without regard for the fine points of Marquis of Queensberry-type rules. Also good is Rocco beginning to sweat in fear of his life as the storm moves in while Bogey gives us his famous laugh and grin as he assesses the essential cowardice of the petty gangster.Lauren Bacall, in one of her more modest roles, does a lot without saying much, and Lionel Barrymore is very good as the cantankerous old guy in a wheelchair. Claire Trevor actually won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for her work, and she was good as the alcoholic moll with a heart of gold. Robinson won nothing, but he really dominated the picture and demonstrated why he was one of Hollywood's greatest stars.Bottom line: watch this to see the gangster yarn meld into film noir with overtones of the psychoanalytical drama that characterized many of the black and white Hollywood films of the forties and early fifties.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

Bogart and Bacall have an intense personal chemistry that sparks on screen, and the supporting cast of Barrymore and E. G. Robinson give their best performances ever. Robinson, in particular, as the slimy gangster johnny rocco is great - his portrayal of the 'banality of evil' is the best I've ever seen.The screenplay is magnificent. Not just the dialog, but also the balance of characters is perfect. For each good character there is a bad one of equal weight, forming a perfectly complementary totality, a yin/yang balance that teeters between triumph and disaster according to the finest shades of personal choice. It's an examination of freedom, of corruption, of courage and betrayal - a perfect encapsulation of the world, focused upon a hotel on a tiny island in the middle of a hurricane.This movie deserves more recognition than it gets. The action is understated but intense, densely-packed with meaning and significance, at both the individual and cultural level. Watch this movie with new eyes!",

            "content": "John Huston was a remarkable man who was an excellent director, as well as a superb adapter of other people's materials, as he clearly shows in \"Key Largo\". This movie, based on Maxwell Anderson's play, is a triumph for Mr. Huston, who co-wrote the adaptation with Richard Brooks, another man who would go on to direct his own movies.Mr. Huston had an uncanny way to get the best people in the business in his projects. Karl Freund's black and white cinematography is wonderful, as is the haunting music provided by Max Steiner, a man who was a genius in his own right for always giving that special touch to the scores he was hired to do.\"Key Largo\" has been compared with \"The Desperate Hours\", in which Humphrey Bogart also appeared. In fact, both were theatrical plays, and perhaps that's the basis of the comparison. As much as Mr. Huston tried to open \"Key Largo\", it still has a certain feeling of the drama one would get in a stage production.This is a film that has Humphrey Bogart playing a good guy, Frank McCloud, not his usual bad guy from other movies. Also, we see a rather quiet Lauren Bacall as Nora Temple; in her other films with Mr. Bogart she played more sultrier roles. Edgar G. Robinson is perfect as the crooked Johnny Rocco, the gangster that has decided to take over the Largo Hotel to do his business. In a great performance, Mr. Robinson shows an ugly side. Claire Trevor plays a gangster moll Gaye Dawn and has a great opportunity. Also Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Gomez and Harry Lewis are seen in supporting roles.\"Key Largo\" will not disappoint because it shows a tense situation in which at the beginning seems a hopeless cause, but the hurricane will change things around and justice and sanity will prevail.",

Robinson the vicious, antiquated symbol of raw brute force\u0085 Paul Muni had appeared in the original Maxwell Anderson play in 1939, and director John Huston and Richard Brooks updated the piece to make it more contemporary\u0085 As a film, it was treated in a slightly heavy-handed, overly talky manner, displacing action in favor of strong character studies of a group of disparate individuals trapped by a kingpin gangster\u0085 Claire Trevor won an Academy Award as Gaye Dawn, Rocco's boozy mistress who was willing to lower herself to any depths for the mere expedient of getting a drink\u0085 She is finally pushed too far by Rocco, has accepted too many insults and been rejected once too often, so she decides to help the besieged prisoners\u0085Lauren Bacall was Nora Temple, an antiseptic dreamer who persisted in believing that evil should always be opposed by a valiant Sir Galahad and temporarily has her illusions shattered when Bogart apparently doesn't agree to fit into her mold\u0085 As Bacall's grandfather, Lionel Barrymore was another heroic figure who, could afford to be a verbal hero, knowing that a retreat to the safety of his confining wheelchair could protect him\u0085Edward G. Robinson as Rocco was a mass of contradictions\u0085 Brutal with a gun safely in his hand, dreaming of the glories he once knew in the good old days when he was a big shot, all he has left are the memories\u0085 He was a man whose criminal wisdom permits no ethics and few feelings\u0085 He offers Bogart an empty gun to shoot it out with him... He is also a man afraid, who sweats when the hurricane approaches and poses a threat to his safety...

Robinson, commanding, convincing, was still not so coldly frightening a villain as Humphrey Bogart\u0085 And, one can imagine how the idea of the storming hurricane appealed at the time\u0085 The violence and the drama outside, as the wind tore at the palm trees and the waves threatened to swallow the little wooden hotel, would surely underscore and heighten the tensions within... Not so! And not only because the studio storm was not always up to nature's level...

            "review_title": "Superb cast and taut drama",
            "content": "While chiefly remembered as a Bogart/Bacall vehicle, this story of expatriate gangsters commandeering a sleepy tropical hotel is, in actuality, a tightly directed ensemble piece with acting chops to burn.There's Edward G. Robinson as Johnny Rocco--the brash, boisterous, sleazy gangster whose frailties (cowardice and a yearning for better times) gradually unfold before us.  There's Lionel Barrymore as James Temple, the delightfully feisty and crusty hotel owner overcome with revulsion at Rocco's presence.  There's Thomas Gomez, Harry Lewis, Dan Seymour and William Haade as Curly, Toots, Angel and Ralphie--Rocco's colorful but hard-edged thugs who are presences unto themselves.  There's Claire Trevor as Gaye, Rocco's declining, alcoholic moll who symbolizes more than anything how far Rocco has fallen.That's an awful lot.  Too much scenery-chewing from Bogart or Bacall would push it over the top--and director/screenwriter/demigod John Huston knows it.  He coaxes remarkably restrained and subtle performances out of his star couple.  The romantic tension between them is suggested but never shoved in the audience's face.  Bogart's wandering war vet Frank McCloud keeps his lips tight and plays his cards close to the chest--a streetwise outsider through and through.  Bacall's Nora Temple lets her anger and distaste pour out through her smoldering eyes more often than her mouth.Ultimately, the subtlety is so well-hidden between the gigantic performances of Robinson and Barrymore that you might miss just how sophisticated Frank's story is.  Disillusioned and drifting since the war, he stops in to visit the wife (Nora) and father (James) of a fallen comrade whose bravery he admired.  Implicit in his visit is an unspoken apology that it is he, and not their loved one, who is returning home.  The fallen soldier is a constant unseen presence in the film--his bravery and honor mocking what Frank sees as his own cowardice and inability to stand up to Rocco (Bogart's fast-talking explanation of why he didn't shoot Rocco when he had the chance is classic and rare--a protagonist lying to his friends and his audience--\"One Rocco more or less isn't worth dying for!\").  Frank's eventual decision to take on Rocco and his hoods is a victory against the fear that plagues and shames him.In a larger sense, this is a true period movie about a generation of men returning home from the greatest conflict the world has ever known.  Most of our national memories of World War II are proud and triumphant, but, as with any war, it left countless people scarred physically and mentally.  Though Frank is a decorated soldier, he feels somehow that what he did wasn't enough (because he lived and his friend did not?), and he returns back to a country in which he has no place with no real pride or satisfaction.  The confrontation with Rocco affords him a chance (perhaps only possible in Hollywood or on the stage, where the story of \"Key Largo\" was first performed) to make things right with his world.While it has not aged as well as the better-known films of Bogart's and Huston's careers, \"Key Largo\" is a film that, for a little investment of attention and thought, will pay big dividends to anyone that really and truly loves movies.",

            "content": "Repeat viewings of \"Key Largo\" will only enrich your appreciation of it. The superb cast and directing by John Huston make this a must see film for fans of the 1940 classics, particularly fans of stars Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. Robinson, and Lauren Bacall.Bogey and Bacall made four films in a space of four years, this being their final appearance together. Bogey's character, retired Army Major Frank McCloud seeks out the family of a war buddy killed in action. He finds Nora Temple (Bacall) and her father James Temple (Lionel Barrymore) as the owners of a seasonal hotel in Key Largo, and comes to realize that all is not quite right in the serene setting. Bogey's response to an inquisitive Nora Temple is about to be tested - \"Life on land has become too complicated for my taste\". Edward G. Robinson's appearance as mobster Johnny Rocco is suitably delayed in the film to build suspense, and he breaks on screen with all of his classic nuance - the sneer, the braggadocio, the \"What's with you wise guy?\" sarcasm. Rocco suffers from a fall from past glory, a time when he was regarded as \"the one and only\", a virtual emperor of the crime world. Now he's a two bit hoodlum, holed up in a Key Largo hotel, hoping to cash in on a counterfeit money scam. With him are a coterie of henchmen, and an alcoholic moll superbly portrayed by Claire Trevor, earning a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance. Johnny Rocco is desperate to make a mob connection to unload his counterfeit money stash, and refuses to submit to the might of an impending hurricane. Fueling Rocco's desperation is a stoic Bogart - \"You don't like it Rocco - the storm; show it your gun why don't ya, if it doesn't stop, shoot it!\". Helpless in the face of the coming storm, Rocco's anxiety mounts, and in a tense scene he confronts war hero McCloud by throwing him a gun to force a showdown. But Bogey's not buying it - \"One Rocco more or less isn't worth dying for\". In a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation, McCloud must decide to man a boat to Cuba for Rocco's gang to make a getaway. In the one improbable scene of the film, Trevor's Gaye Dawn character secretly maneuvers Rocco's gun away from him and slips it into Bogey's hand, while surrounded by all of the bad guys. How Rocco would not have missed his weapon (until later on the boat) is an element that is not suitably dealt with in the film.McCloud's resourcefulness while skippering the getaway boat is sheer cunning, taking out one mobster after another with surgical precision. The desperate Johnny Rocco even shoots one of his own men rather than have his authority challenged. McCloud remains silent to Rocco's taunts, causing the gangster to force his own hand and become a target for the heroic McCloud.As Bogey heads back to port and the hurricane fades, the film ends on a feel good note as Nora Temple opens the shutters of the hotel and the sunlight streams in - all is well in the world again; the symbolism is extraordinary.Bogey and Robinson appear in four other movies together (Kid Galahad, Brother Orchid, The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse, and Bullets or Ballots), but this is the only one in which they share equal footing, Robinson cast in the lead role in the other films over Bogart. For Robinson fans, the Clitterhouse film is a blast and is recommended to see him in an offbeat role.Another point of interest for film buffs, Jay Silverheels appears in an uncredited role as Tom Osceola, one of the Seminole Indian brothers on the lam from the law in the movie's back story. For an actor as typecast as Silverheels (Tonto in the Lone Ranger), it's always a pleasant surprise and treat to see in an entirely different setting.\"Key Largo\" ranks right up there with \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" and \"The Maltese Falcon\", and perhaps just a notch below \"Casablanca\" among Bogart's finest films, and a true classic worthy of the name.",

            "content": "\"Key Largo\" is one of three Humphrey Bogart noir mysteries that have become classic films. The other two are \"The Petrified Forest\" of 1936 and \"The Maltese Falcon\" of 1941. Besides being intriguing stories, all three films have other things in common. Most notably are the sizable casts of leading and top-drawer actors. Besides Bogart, \"The Falcon\" had Mary Astor, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet and others. \"The Forest\" also had Leslie Howard, Bette Davis and others. \"Key Largo\" had Bacall, Edward G. Robinson, Lionel Barrymore and Claire Trevor. She won the best supporting actress Oscar for her portrayal of Gaye Dawn. Bogart plays a former Army major who had served in Italy during WW and was a friend of James Temple's son, who was killed in the war. He has stopped by to see the senior Temple who is played by Lionel Barrymore. Bacall is his daughter-in-law Nora, who is the widow of his deceased son. Robinson plays Johnny Rocco a once big-time crime boss from the days of prohibition. He and his gang have taken over Temple's hotel in Key Largo where they are arranging an underworld trade. Trevor's Gaye Dawn is a one-time top club singer and girlfriend of Rocco. She has become an alcoholic in the years that Rocco has been away. He had been kicked out of the U.S. There are many tense scenes in this fine film. Local police are checking for two Indians who have escaped from jail. A hurricane is developing. The local Indians have come to the hotel for shelter in the storm, only to be turned out by the gangsters. A good supporting cast play Rocco's sidekicks, and the intrigue intensifies until the very end. The film has an ending that comes as a bit of a surprise. But this is one very good, superbly acted, and interesting mystery thriller.",

            "content": "This is a terrific film and it's among the best performances by Humphrey Bogart. I think the only reason the film is more widely recognized as a classic is because Bogart had so many terrific performances.The film begins with Bogey arriving at Key Largo (a large island off the SE coast of Florida). He's there to see the widow and father of an army buddy. Before long, however, storm warnings occur--a bad one is headed their way. And, near the same time, a group of gangsters arrive. It seems that the boss (Edward G. Robinson) was deported some time back but is sneaking back into the country. Well, due to the storm and Robinson being recognized, the gang decide to stay--during which time they menace and torment everyone simply because they can. In many ways, the film is similar to Bogart's later film, THE DESPERATE HOURS, though in this case Bogart isn't the gang leader but an innocent man pulled into this situation.What is best about this film is Bogart's character. For a long time, you really aren't sure who he is or what he really stands for--is he a hero or just a jerk trying to save his skin? Sure, Robinson is great to watch, too, but his role is much more typical of Robinson's earlier gangster roles. Exceptional writing, a great sense of suspense and great acting--this film has it all.",

            "content": "Humphrey Bogart is a man disillusioned by war who comes up against a gangster and his mob in \"Key Largo,\" a 1948 film directed by John Huston and also, starring Lauren Bacall, Clare Trevor, Edward G. Robinson, and Lionel Barrymore.James Temple (Barrymore) runs the Largo Hotel on Key Largo with his daughter-in-law, Nora (Bacall). Frank McCloud (Bogart), is paying Temple a visit to tell of his son's bravery and death in his regiment during the war. Though the hotel is closed for the season, there are people there who seem anxious that McCloud leave immediately. Since a hurricane is brewing, Temple agreed to shelter them, not knowing who they are - a gang of thieves, led by the notorious Johnny Rocco (Robinson) who are awaiting a shipment of some kind. Soon Temple, Nora, and Frank are held hostage until the storm passes and the men can get their shipment and leave. Ultimately they expect Frank to sail them to Cuba.A storm rages outside and inside in this film, with Robinson playing an abusive tough guy who is terrified of the weather. Besides his lackeys (Thomas Gomez, Harry Lewis and Marc Lawrence), his drunken girlfriend, Gaye Dawn (Trevor) accompanies him and is at his beck and call though he's horrible to her. Like Rick in \"Casablanca,\" Frank doesn't want to stick his neck out for anyone, which disappoints Nora who believes in fighting for what's right. Frank holds onto his resolve as long as he can, but like Rick, while his mouth says one thing, his genetic makeup causes him to do something else. Bogart, of course, could have played Johnny Rocco as well as he does Frank McCloud and been equally convincing, just as Robinson could be evil incarnate and turn around and play Dr. Ehrlich. Both are magnificent actors of the golden era, though their techniques are quite different. Where Robinson would grow a beard, assume an accent and a gentler tone playing \"good\" people, Bogart plays Frank just as he would have played Johnny or a lawyer for the poor in \"Knock on Any Door\" - yet the results would be vastly different. With Bogart, internalization of a role gives him uncanny timing; you don't know how he's different - he just is with a mere tweak of his screen persona. The most telling thing he does as Frank is, when Barrymore thanks him for telling him about his son, he extends his hand - instead of shaking hands, Bogart sandwiches Barrymore's hand in both of his - a tender gesture from a supposed tough guy.Lauren Bacall has a role that could have been played by any ing\u00e9nue in Hollywood, taking part in the film because of both Huston and her husband. She's neither sexy nor glamorous in this. In fact, she looks like she's not wearing any makeup. She comes off as very feminine, vulnerable, and beautiful. She doesn't hold back her anger - when she spits at Johnny, you want to cheer but are afraid for her as well. Barrymore is excellent as a man humiliated by the realization that he's helpless against these goons.Acting kudos, however, go to the showiest role, that of Gaye Dawn, for which Claire Trevor won an Oscar. Gaye is a former singer successful in clubs - when Johnny makes her sing for a drink, she describes with pride and wistfulness her gowns, her lighting, and her act - it's one of the most pathetic scenes ever, this broken-down lush singing flat with the remnants of a great sound. It's a terrific performance, full of anger, desperation, and finally bravery.\"Key Largo\" isn't the most exciting film ever made, but it's a rich character study which will keep the viewer absorbed. And years later, it even inspired a song: \"We had it all Just like Bogie and Bacall Starring in our old late, late show Sailing away to Key Largo.\" For film aficionados, Bogie is indeed the stuff that dreams are made of.",

In the play, the gangsters are Mexican bandits, the war in question is the Spanish Civil War, and Frank is a disgraced deserter who dies at the end to protect the family.For proper atmosphere Director John Huston and screenwriter Richard Brooks hammered out their story while actually staying at a Key Largo hotel off season. There they heard from witnesses about the Florida Keys Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 which caused over 400 deaths.Huston personalized the script by making Bogie's character a World War II veteran who had served in the Italian campaign at Battle of San Pietro where Huston himself had served.Edward G. Robinson became a major star playing a gangster in Little Caesar back in 1930. His character Rocco was modeled on real life gangsters Al Capone and Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano. At the start of his career he was the lead and Bogart would get killed off before the end. Bogart and Robinson appeared in four films together before this one, Bullets or Ballots (1936), Kid Galahad (1937), The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse (1938) and my favorite Brother Orchid (1940).Director Huston wanted take away the glamour of the gangster and show him for the thug he was.Bogart's character was tired of war and killing and wanted nothing to do with fighting.In her autobiography, By Myself, Lauren Bacall recalls Key Largo as \"one of the happiest movie experiences. I thought how marvelous a medium the movies were, to enable one to meet, befriend, and work with such people.\" Bogart never gave Bacall direction in front of anyone but choose to coach her away from the set telling her don't over act\u0085 if someone points a gun at you the audience knows your scared, you don't have to show it. Robinson later commented on his marquee status in his autobiography (All My Yesterdays): \"The journey down. No suspense to this. I didn't even argue. Why not second billing? At fifty-three I was lucky to get any billing at all.\"Claire Trevor plays Rocco's alcoholic companion, a character based on Lucky Luciano's mistress, Gay Orlova. Trevor kept asking Huston when could they rehearse her singing, he always answered they had plenty of time. Then one day after lunch he told her to get into costume they were filming the scene. With no practice or warning a piano hit one note and he made her sing it cold \u2013 at the end of the song one of the crew said to another \u2013 \"She's going to win an Oscar for that\" \u2013 and she did. This was Lauren Bacall's 5th film, she was 24 years old. Today she is 84 (the sexiest over 80 actress I might add) and since turning 70 she has made 24 films!Jay Silverheels plays one of the Osceola Indians, he was so good the next year he was cast in the LONE RANGER TV show and would appear in 220 episodes of that show. Harry Lewis plays the young gangster in the white suit, Edward 'Toots' Bass. Unfortunately his acting career never took off. Poor Harry Lewis and his wife wanted to stay in Hollywood while he looked for more acting work so they opened a restaurant and called it Hamburger Hamlet. He worked occasionally and the restaurant did well so he opened more locations, in 1987 he sold all his restaurants and the name for 33 Million dollars.

The Mummy\u0085 and was the chief cameraman on I LOVE LUCY) 15) Music: Max Steiner (Citizen Kane, King Kong, Top Hat, Gone With The Wind)Did I mention the song? The 1981 song \"Key Largo\", by singer-songwriter Bertie Higgins, draws heavily on influences from the film. This song hit the Top 10 on the pop chart in the United States and went to #1 on the adult contemporary chart.",

            "content": "Edgy, suspenseful, dramatic. For what more could you ask? This has to be one of Bogey's best performances, but how can you tell? All his performances were darned good, but this time he seems almost relaxed even as his character goes through some major changes. His apparent relaxed state does not in any way translate to a dialed-in performance or a seeming calm where he should be anything but, but comes off more as a comfort within his own skin; a confidence and self assured quality he seemed just shy of, in past performances.Although I'm no fan of war movies, I've never seen a Bogey performance I didn't like. But Key Largo carries with it a large amount of suspense that starts from the early scenes, and survives all the way through to the very end, with no release or break. This must have had theater patrons literally on the edge of their seats way back when. We were more innocent as a nation then...as a society.All in all? I cannot recommend this for younger viewers, as there is a base roughness in it most modern movies, even with all the cursing and gore, never seem to achieve. I suppose that, in our innocence, it wasn't just our naivet\u00e9 as a society that was heightened, but our darkness, as well.This is very well written with believable dialog and tremendously enigmatic characters.

            "content": "Stunning entertainment with twisted intrigue , thrills , realist frames and dramatic happenings . The big main star , Bogart , Bacall , Robinson , is backed by a host of fine support cast . It begins when a man visits his old friend's hotel and finds a a mob of gangsters running things . As a hurricane approaches, the two end up confronting each other . As a storm of fear and fury in the sizzling Florida Keys and the events go wrong . It is starred by Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) who travels to a run-down hotel on Key Largo to honor the memory of a friend . The dead soldier's father, James Temple (Lionel Barrymore was severely disabled by arthritis and was confined to a wheelchair) runs a hotel in Key Largo with the help of his now widowed daughter-in-law Nora (Lauren Bacall) . But the motel is taken over by a bunch of mobsters led by Johnny Rocco (Edward G Robinson, his role was modeled on Al Capone, who retired to South Florida shortly after the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and died there of complications due to advanced syphilis) and his hoodlums (Thomas Gomez , Harry Lewis , Marc Lawrence) . Rocco is accompanied by his drunk moll (Claire Trevor , her role was based on real-life moll Gay Orlova , gangster Lucky Luciano's girlfriend). Exciting and thrilling picture with a complex intrigue , nice character studio , suspense , a lot of killings and interesting deeds . One of the most grueling of even Bogart's mobster movies all done in gripping realism and well shot by the great John Huston . Interesting and moving screenplay by Richard Brooks , John Huston and based on the play by Maxwell Anderson . However , the film version of \"Key Largo\" has very little to do with Maxwell Anderson's original play , all the characters in the play had their names changed in the film version. This was very unusual for a play written by Anderson, who was then one of the most highly regarded American playwrights, and whose best-known plays had, on the whole, been filmed faithfully . The picture has a Noir treatment though excessively stagy , but stars can quite compensate for some claustrophobic moments . This first-rate but slow-paced picture draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama and emotion . Twisted film Noir about gangsters , robbing , forgery , treason , troubled relationships and dark secrets . It is a tough and tortuous thriller that has a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail . Exciting as well as rare film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , attractive cinematography in black and white by Karl Freund and magnificent musical score by the classic Max Steiner . This is pure cinema from the first to the last shot, where there's nothing left and each image has its sense and meaning . Stirring ending , in fact the final confrontation on a boat is actually the ending to the book \"To Have and Have Not\" which wasn't used in the film version . The ramshackle hotel where most of the drama unfolds was constructed on the Warner Bros lot along with the beach area. Exterior shots of the hurricane were actually taken from stock footage used in Night unto night (1949).Here Bogart is extraordinary and as cool as ever , his scenes with Lauren Bacall are awesome though underplayed compared to those they shared in The Big sleep , Dark passage and To have and to have not . This was fourth and final film pairing of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall , a fifth film was planned several years later, but Bogart died before it could be made . Additionaly , the subjective camera record Humphrey's impressions giving a top-drawer acting . It's splendidly played by Humphrey Bogart ; he was in his best period of the late 40s and early 50s when he starred classic movies such as \u00a8The Caine Mutiny\u00a8, \u00a8Sabrina\u00a8, \u00a8Beat the devil\u00a8, \u00a8The African Queen\u00a8, \u00a8Sirocco\u00a8, \u00a8In a lonely place\u00a8, \u00a8Chain lightning\u00a8, \u00a8Knock on any door\u00a8 and \u00a8The enforcer\u00a8. Supporting cast is frankly well , such as Lionel Barrymore , Claire Trevor , Thomas Gomez , Harry Lewis , Marc Lawrence , Monte Blue and uncredited Jay Silverheels , famous Indian Tonto of Lone Ranger . The motion picture produced in enough budget by Jack L. Warner and Jerry Wald was well directed by John Huston , though being extremely theatrical. The main character, Frank McCloud/Bogart describes having served in the WWII battle at San Pietro, Italy similarly to director/co-screenwriter John Huston had been involved in that battle as the creator of the documentary film San Pietro (1945) while he was in the U.S. Army's motion picture unit . Nice work by John Huston in demonstrating his skill at all areas : as technical , using all kind of resources for illustrating the interesting as well as dramatic story with an engaging screenplay , adding great actors , adequate filmmaking and enjoyable narration . The movie was filmed in only 78 days, virtually all on the Warner Bros. lot, except for a few shots in Florida used for the opening scenes . This film \u00a8Key Largo\" or \"Hurac\u00e1n de Pasiones\" or \u00a8Cayo largo\u00a8 is absolutely recommended . Rating : Above average , it is a nice tale with enough drama , thrills and turns to keep you guessing .",

Along comes Bogey, who has come to visit the father of a war time pal who was killed, and of course, gets drawn into the drama.Huston's cast is flawless. Bogart as Frank McCloud is suitably laid back and brave as he confronts the gangsters headed by Edward G. Robinson as Johnny Rocco. Lauren Bacall plays the widow of Bogey's war time friend and the venerable Lionel Barrymore is outstanding as Temple, the hotel proprietor.

This time their roles are reversed. This film was unfortunately, the last time Bogart and Robinson appeared together. It's a pity because they always played against each other so well. I always liked Robinson better on the wrong side of the law. His Rocco is a slimy brutal villain. He even gets to slap Bogey around in this one.It is interesting to note the name of the boat that the gang make their getaway on is called \"Santana\".

Robinson) holding a group of people (Humphrey Bogart, Lionel Barrymore, Lauren Bacall) hostage in a hotel while a hurricane blows over. This might not be as legendary as Casablanca or as mind challenging as The Maltese Falcon but I still think this film holds up very well against those classics and I'd go even further by saying this is one of the most entertaining films ever made. I hear a lot of people say this film is a classic but it's not very deep but I say so what? The film is fast, tense and entertaining from the first scene to the last and I think you could call it a greatest hits type of film as the studio and director certainly wanted and needed a hit with this film so they just threw everything at the viewer and delivered a lot of fun. Robinson gives another terrific performance and seeing him go up against not only Bogart but also Barrymore is priceless. The scenes of Robinson freaking out as the storm nears is perfectly done by the actor. Barrymore is flawless as the cranky old man not wanting to take anything from the gangster. Bogart is also excellent in a film that delivers him one of his strongest roles. Bacall and Claire Trevor are wonderful in their supporting roles. This film is certainly dialogue driven but this is enough to pack all the energy that the film needs as the actors really bring the script to life.

            "content": "Humphrey Bogart and John Huston must be considered the artistic equivalent of De Niro-Scorsese.  Huston and Bogie made several films together, this being one of their best.  But there is another combo that comes to an end in cinema's history:  Bogie and Bacall appear on screen for the final time together.  It is their finest collaboration.  Edward G. Robinson, \"Little Caesar\" himself, returns to gangster form after years of playing the good guy (Wilder's DOUBLE INDEMNITY, Welles' THE STRANGER) and has one of the more memorable entrances in film villain history.  We see him in a tub, smoking, a fan in front of him.  He seems to be decaying in a way, but \"Johnny Rocco\" is still to be reckoned with.  This is the Robinson we all love, demented and wise, sinister yet humorous.  The Largo Hotel is the setting and a hurricane of drama, heroism, and rain is coming.Huston stages the film much like the play it is based on, yet we never feel confined.  There is enough colorful dialogue to go around.  Surprisingly, much of it is not by Bogart, who plays probably his most quiet role, promoting his character through facial gestures more than words.  He plays off Robinson and his posse of mobsters perfectly in this way, allowing Edward G. to dominate the majority of the film, which is the point. Lionel Barrymore plays the chair-ridden owner of the Largo and his daughter Bacall is falling in love with Bogart, naturally.  They are at the mercy of Rocco and his boys, all of whom have some itchy trigger fingers.  Bogart is just buying his time to make his move.  The finale is extremely well done and foresees suspense endings to come.Lauren Bacall is one of the most beautiful actresses to grace the screen, especially in black and white.  Her perfect features look sculpted in this light and her sensual stare is enough to make you melt.  Her smoky voice and attitude is an excellent match for Bogie's simple, heroic character.  Film Noir becomes Florida Noir here, as the lightening outside the windows of the hotel play games with the shadows and atmosphere of events inside. Robinson murders an innocent man with the look of a terrifying ghost, lightening flashing on him and all.  The thunder substitutes for the sound of cars and street-life normally heard in classic noir pictures.  KEY LARGO is a very good film, dark and suspenseful, in the most pleasant of locales.RATING: 8 of 10",

            "content": "When I think of the colorized version that, regrettably, is the only copy of this excellent film noir in my video store, I can't help but think of a comment Orson Welles made to a friend a few days before his death in regards to Turner's plans to colorize \"Citizen Kane\"(thankfully defeated, because of the fact that it came under Welles' original contract with RKO, which specified that only Welles would make changes): \"Keep Turner and his g**d*** Crayolas away from my movie.\" Watching this version of \"Key Largo\" more than proves Welles' point; the lighting becomes terrible in several key scenes, particularly the closing ones on the boat, to whereas before, you could see what was going on, now you can just barely tell a thing. That said, it can't destroy the fine work that this film truly is.I was led to this film by my mother, who called it one of her favorites from Bogie (another being \"The African Queen\") and now I can see why. Leave it to John Huston, the man who was bold enough to make a true adaptation of Dashiell Hammet's \"The Maltese Falcon\", to give us a tightly woven drama that never feels forced. Bogie's Frank McCloud is probably the most silent of all the strong-silent types he ever played, barely saying more than is necessary for the scene he's in. Such reticience leaves some large blanks for the audience to fill; though he says that he doesn't care one way or another, I really don't believe him. The feeling I get the entire time he's in the clutches of Johnny Rocco's gang is that he's just waiting for his moment. After all, you don't survive WWII's Italian campaign and not know when it's best to stay still and when it's best to make your play. That's why he threw away the gun offered to him by Rocco; no way was Rocco's gang just going to let their boss be gunned down even if the deck was stacked in Rocco's favor. The murders of the deputy and the Indians on the lam just adds to the need to take care of business.I was a little disappointed to see Bacall in such a minor role (it still had to be better than what she was given, sans Bogie, after this film, from reports I've heard), but her spitting in Rocco's face is an undeniably powerful moment. As for Edward G. Robinson, one of Hollywood's original tough guys imported from Bucharest, Romania, he literally runs away with the part of Johnny Rocco, the former big-shot with delusions of grandeur. He's a casually vicious, ruthless fount of hate, bitter over his fallen status and hungering for a comeback. But he still fails to draw an important lesson from his soused ex-galpal: times change and not necessarily for the better. He may have defied a ton of police in his day or gun down a deputy in this one, but it still doesn't change the fact that the outside world (nicely symbolized by the hurricane) can and will eat him alive without the slightest trace of indigestion. All Rocco is is a dinosaur: proud, strong, but too stupid to realize that his kind have become extinct.In fact, that may very well be why McCloud was such a natural match for Rocco as an opponent. McCloud had changed his spots many times in his life to fit the job situation he was in, while Rocco has never been anything else but what he is now. Small wonder that one can see the confrontation between them coming to full steam. This core element, and all the others mentioned and not mentioned here, help make \"Key Largo\" one of the great unsung classics of Humphrey Bogart AND Edward G. Robinson. Here's looking at you, tough guys.",

Ah intense, what a truly befitting word to use as regards John Huston's direction here, perfectly capturing the stifling heat of Largo and coupling it with the sweltering tension inside this run down hotel.Key Largo is often thought of as the lesser film from the Bogart/Bacall production line, which in fairness is against some pretty special opposition, maybe we do lose the sexual chemistry of the mighty duo here, but in its place is a mano mano face off teetering on the brink of explosion, Edward G Robinson's weasel Rocco in danger of becoming a loose cannon to McCloud's staid drifter, the atmosphere is palpable as this room full of hate and mistrust starts bubbling to boiling point.Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Edward G Robinson, Lionel Barrymore, Claire Trevor (Academy Award Winner Best Supporting Actress), Thomas Gomez and Harry Lewis are all excellent, all benefiting from master director Huston moulding them together, whilst Karl Freund's deep focus photography perfectly encapsulates the mood of the piece. I just love Key Largo so much, from a heart tugging singing for your drink scene, to a retreating in the shadows shot of Bacall, Key Largo is one of the reasons I became a cinema obsessive. 9/10.",

A great location and setting, a real credit to John Huston.In short, Frank McCloud (Bogart) an ex war hero and living at no-fixed-address, visits (by request) his dead war buddy's father (barrymore) & widow (Bacall). As he arrives, it doesn't take long for Frank to work out the Hotel is temporarily hostage to a big mob gangster - Rocco (robinson) and his cronies.The film instantly grabs you, it looks beautiful, there is a lot of substance and well thought out scripts, nothing glamorous or smart, just very good story telling. A good side line to the story, are the Native American clan, who due to an approaching hurricane need to find shelter, their plight is placed nicely into the story. There is a scene in which Bacall introduces Bogart to the oldest member of the clan, a 100 and something year old Native woman which is just so genuine, I still don't believe this woman was an actress, Huston must have improvised this into the script.Not only is Bogart superb in this, but also the whole cast. It goes without saying Edward G Robinson's performance was second to none as to was - his right hand man (Harry Lewis I think), Bacall & Rocco's girlfriend - Ziggy..pretty much the entire cast.The whole thing ties up well, without Spoilers it does have a great ending. This is a must not just for Bogie fans but for anyone who can appreciate an intelligent film.-Paul Browne.",

The movie its story and setting really all have the typical stage-play ingredients but thank goodness the movie does not feel like a stage-play. Yet the movie knows to maintain all of the elements that make a stage-play powerful. The movie has some great written dialog and constructed story and one great cast that knows how to handle it all.What an incredible dream cast this movie has. It's the fourth (and last) collaboration of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall and it even isn't their best but that says something more about their other movies than this one really. It's above all a perfectly cast movie, in which all of the actors suit their roles. Edward G. Robinson is of course great as the big, mean, tough gangster boss. The movie also features other acclaimed actors such as Lionel Barrymore, Claire Trevor and Marc Lawrence.It's a movie that is mostly set at one location (a small hotel), which allowed the writers to use their creativity to make the movie interesting and intriguing to watch and gave the actors as well the opportunity to let their talent shine. The end result is also an extremely well constructed and intriguing movie to watch, from start till finish. Never a slow or dull moment here! It's of course also thanks to John Huston's professional directing that the movie and its 'simple' concept works out so well.In my opinion this is not really a film-noir, even though it uses some of its elements. It's more a 'modern' crime thriller, that lays its emphasis mostly on the dialog and characters, that get deepened out a lot.A fantastic John Huston classic.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "What would 1940's American cinema be without Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall? It's a rhetorical question of course. But in this 1940's Bogie and Bacall classic, their presence is almost overshadowed by the combined talents of Claire Trevor, Lionel Barrymore, and the inimitable Edward G. Robinson. What a cast!Their story, about being stranded in a quaint, isolated, Florida hotel with high ceilings and ceiling fans during a hurricane is well known. Most film buffs regard \"Key Largo\" highly, partly because of its star power, partly because of the ingenious story, but also because of the excellent high contrast B&W lighting that gives the visuals an Expressionistic cinematic style. When the electricity goes out, and the only source of lighting in the Largo Hotel is the oil lamps, the film oozes a wonderfully noir atmosphere. The howling wind outside, combined with the threatening presence of gangsters inside adds a strange mix of tension and danger.Bogie plays Frank McCloud, a WWII military man who seems to have lost his courage; he's now branded a coward. It's a tough position to be in when you're in the presence of a gangster like Johnny Rocco. When Rocco demands that McCloud helm the boat, to take the gangsters to Cuba, McCloud's courage is tested again.The film's acting is terrific. Claire Trevor deservedly won an Oscar for her performance as Gaye Dawn, the has-been nightclub singer and companion of Johnny Rocco. Thomas Gomez is great as Rocco's sidekick, Curly. But my personal favorite performance is Lionel Barrymore, as wheelchair-bound James Temple, the crusty and amiable owner of the Largo Hotel. That he is confined to a wheelchair adds immensely to the depth of his character.The only weakness in the story is the subplot about the Seminole Indians. That element seems awkward and out of place. Also, the film's nondescript background music is too loud and intrusive. And it tends to be manipulative, not unlike other noir films of that era.Those issues aside, \"Key Largo\" is the perfect movie to watch late at night during a thunderstorm. The film has a ton of cinematic atmosphere. It proceeds at a pleasantly slow, lazy pace. And it's got some of the greatest actors of that era, including Bogie and Bacall.",

            "content": "There may be other Bogart/Huston collaborations that are better known and it may not be the first movie people think of when Bogart/Bacall are mentioned, but Key Largo is a fine movie in its own right. Bogart is an Army Captain visiting the wife and father of one of the dead soldiers who served under him. The wife and father run a little hotel on Key Largo. Bogart's not the only guest at the hotel, though. A group of gangsters has decided to hold up there for a while. But the gangsters aren't the only threat to Bogart and the others. A hurricane is blowing on shore that threatens everyone - even the guys with the guns.Bogart and Bacall are good as ever. Lionel Barrymore is a pleasure to watch. And Claire Trevor's Academy Award was deserving. But I want to spend the rest of this review discussing Edward G. Robinson's performance. Robinson has never been a particular favorite of mine. But, it's difficult not to enjoy him in Key Largo. To be a man of such slight stature, on screen he comes across like a giant. His character, Johnny Rocco, dominates almost every scene - even scenes he's not in. Before we meet Rocco, he's already on of the biggest characters in the movie. All his hired stooges have to do is point to the bedroom door and say something like \"He's in there, taking a nap\" and Rocco immediately becomes the most important person in the movie. Robinson is amazing to watch as he demonstrates his dominance by threatening everyone (even his own men). But Robinson saves the best for last. As the hurricane hits, he changes and becomes like a frightened child. That Robinson was capable of playing the heavy so convincingly in one scene and the weakling so perfectly in the next is evidence of his wonderful abilities. It's really a joy to behold.",

            "content": "While KEY LARGO is certainly no masterpiece, it IS highly entertaining, thanks largely to two larger than life performances from EDWARD G. ROBINSON (at his mightiest) and CLAIRE TREVOR (who manages to steal every scene she is in as a lush past her prime as a torch singer).But it's not quite the sort of thing Bogart and Bacall fans were used to. Lauren is much more demure than usual, very low-key but earnest in her performance and she does well in a part that is not quite as sultry as her other roles of this period. Bogart too is low-key in a rather colorless role (for him anyway), as a soldier who drops in on Bacall and her father (Lionel Barrymore) at a hotel in the Florida keys to give them information about her soldier husband.The oncoming storm is nothing compared to the histrionics of EDWARD G. ROBINSON who chews up all the scenery in sight as a gangster almost as black-hearted as his Wolf Larsen in THE SEA WOLF, even though most of the scenery is confined to a couple of hotel settings. Surprisingly, for a film directed by John Huston, he has allowed the storm aspect to be the least realistic part of the setting. It all seems to take place on a Warner sound stage with banging shutters and loose pictures on the wall, but not much of a storm to be concerned about except when miniatures are shown of a very strong tide and a hotel battered by winds and rain.But these are minor squabbles when all the performances are edgy and wonderful, particularly Thomas Gomez, Dan Seymour and Marc Lawrence. But it's CLAIRE TREVOR and EDW. G. ROBINSON that have the most powerful roles and they play them with every bit of professionalism they can muster--and that's plenty. Trevor has never been more effective and richly deserved her Supporting Role Oscar.Some of the film drags, burdened by too much of Maxwell Anderson's stage dialog which tends to give a static look to some of the scenes, but the last half-hour is full of vigorous movement as the story reaches a satisfying climax.If you're looking for a typical Bogart/Bacall film, this is not it.

Otherwise the action's pretty much confined to a small hotel lobby with a few forays out to the foggy dock. Without the expert histrionics, things in a tight space might get boring. But then, who's got a bigger personality than Robinson when he's playing the gangster kingpin as he is here. He snarls, threatens, cajoles, and pretty well dominates the screen, while Bogie low-keys it as the reluctant idealist, a signature role he perfected in Casablanca (1942). But you've got to feel a little sorry for Bacall who mostly stands silently around like a loose appendage. Her role looks like an add-on, maybe to please husband Bogart. Of course, it's Trevor who gets the plum distaff role, and she looks the shopworn part to the proverbial 'T'. When she warbles her little ditty, however, her face lights up like girlish innocence restored. And, oh yes, mustn't forget Barrymore who, for once, avoids hamming it up, in a well played part as the hotel owner.I'm not sure how much of that showdown aboard the boat I buy, but I guess they had to find some resolution. Anyway, the movie manages to generate a lot of claustrophobic suspense, with a crowd of characters coming and going. So bring your scorecard to keep track. In most ways, it's worth it.",

            "content": "Stage-to-screen adaptations are always going to pose problems. Actors have to play it differently, and the strongly visual nature of film has to compensate for theatre's emphasis on dialogue. Counterintuitive as it may seem \u2013 since both stage plays and screenplays are essentially just a story told in lines of dialogue and actions \u2013 many adaptations from one to the other are not so much a tweaking as a complete overhaul. However, writer and director John Huston's reworking of the Maxwell Anderson play Key Largo apparently had more to do with changing the political slant. It still contains the small number of locations and lengthy dialogue scenes of a typical stage production. Instead, it is the way Huston stages the action, and the solid performances of the cast that make this workable for the screen.Huston had an expert handling of foreground and background, and he often used it to preserve the length of the shot. For example, in the scene where we first meet Lauren Bacall, rather than change angle to a mid-shot of her, she appears in the background, and then walks towards the camera without a cut. Shots like these keep the action flowing smoothly, especially in these more relaxed early scenes. Despite the sometimes highly elaborate long takes, Huston rarely moves the camera, and those moves that are made neatly follow the action and are never obtrusive. What is obtrusive is the positioning of actors within the shot \u2013 sometimes almost bizarre arrangements of people, with close-ups overhanging the edges of the frame. This puts the focus on the actors in a way that is very intense and exaggerated \u2013 like our experience of a stage play can be.The cast of Key Largo is predictable but worthy. Humphrey Bogart plays the same taciturn, grudgingly-moral lead man that had been his type since the Maltese Falcon. The twist here is that for most of the picture he is an inactive hero, a mere observer, yet one who is constantly thinking and emoting. As such it's one of his more satisfying performances. Lauren Bacall is plainer here than in her previous pairings with Bogie, although I guess to have made her the sultry seductress would have seemed a touch indelicate, given that she is playing his buddy's widow. Edward G. Robinson plays a mob boss yet again, and I'm sorry to say this is him at his most average.As to the supporting players, we see Lionel Barrymore at his most restrained and subtle, although perhaps he was by now too frail to be so vigorously hammy. Claire Trevor was the picture's only Oscar nominee (and indeed winner), for a performance that is notable but overacted. For the record, my vote for Best Supporting Actress that year would have gone to Ellen Corby in I Remember Mama. Finally, an honourable mention goes to silent screen veteran Monte Blue, who is quite impressive in his brief role as the sheriff.While the unevenness of the cast can be overlooked, the one thing I feel really threatens to spoil Key Largo is the score by Max Steiner. He horrendously overworks the dramatic moments with blaring melodramatic arrangements, inappropriate for both the scope and tone of the picture. And the stereotypical \"Red Indian\" theme he gives to the scene where we meet the natives is just an embarrassment. Steiner's failure to \"get\" Key Largo is sadly indicative of a recurring problem in post-war Hollywood. As the studio system began to crumble and the smart producers of the previous decades began to die out, there were no guarantees on having a tight consistent team.",

He was the war buddy of the late son of Key Largo hotel owner Lionel Barrymore who left behind a beautiful widow (Lauren Bacall). Visiting Barrymore and Bacall to share memories of the deceased man, Bogart finds the hotel taken over by mobster Edward G. Robinson, even though the hotel is closed for the summer. Robinson and his gang are bullies, and Bogart's visit doesn't come at a good time. Eddie G. is waiting for a fellow gangster to deliver counterfeit money he plans on running off to Cuba with, but that might not take place because there's a hurricane a-comin'. At first, Bogart wants no part of Robinson and his gang, having become rather world-weary after finding America greatly changed after returning. But quietly realizing that Robinson is nothing more than a coward surrounded by his protective goons, Bogart must decide whether to suppress Robinson for good or just continue to be a pacifist.This is an analogy of many things of the 1940's, particularly with Edward G. Robinson's character. The gangster is representative of the dictators the Allies fought against in the war, courageous when all seems to be going their way, but total chicken as everything falls apart. Robinson is excellent in showing his character's cowardice, especially in a scene where the hotel starts to shake with the elements pounding the island off of the Florida Keys. To think this great actor never got an Oscar Nomination is a shock, let alone not being nominated for this very dimensional performance which could be a continuation of his \"Rico\" character from \"Little Caesar\". Robinson is memorably cruel in a scene concerning his former moll Claire Trevor, an alcoholic nightclub singer whose heart is bigger than the island they are stuck on. Robinson evilly taunts her into singing, then refuses to give in to his promise of allowing her to have a drink if she sang. Trevor, who did win a well-deserved Oscar for this performance, is the heart and soul of the film, a dark lady deserving of love whom we hope will find a new strength and sobriety after facing certain truths. The fact that Bogart, Barrymore and Bacall all sympathize with Trevor without judgment concerning her drinking was very touching.Lionel Barrymore goes from being the evil of \"It's a Wonderful Life\" to the grandfatherly hotel owner and is delightful. Thomas Gomez is the most memorable of Robinson's henchmen. There are some truly haunting moments, particularly the scene of the Native American grandmother who, supposedly 112 years old, must face the elements along with her family when Robinson's gang refuses to allow them into the hotel room during the hurricane. Bogart and Bacall would work together again on TV but never on film, and if this had to be their swan song in working together, it was a swell one, memorably given a tribute in a pop love song years later. I thought the reference to the gangsters hoping for the return of prohibition was quite ironic and amusing. Fine direction by John Huston (who directed Bogart and Gomez in \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" the same year), outstanding photography and a magnificent screenplay make this one of the year's best films.",

They are gangster Johnny Rocco and his henchman; who are waiting to sell their illicit merchandise. Trapped in the hotel with armed gangsters inside and a hurricane raging outside things are about to get very dangerous!This Humphrey Bogart classic raises the tension nicely from the moment Frank enters the hotel until the final confrontation. Bogart is great as the laconic Frank and Edward G. Robinson is suitably villainous as Rocco; a man who is brave with a gun in his hand but cowardly in the face of real danger. Leading lady Lauren Bacall puts in a decent performance as Nora Temple but it is Claire Trevor who stands out as Rocco's Moll Gaye Dawn; a woman desperate for a drink. Most of the film displays its theatrical roots as it is set almost entirely within two rooms in the hotel; this is no bad thing though as it serves to provide a sense of claustrophobia\u0085 these people aren't going anywhere till the storm subsides.

            "content": "\"Key Largo\" is a tense drama which takes place in a stiflingly hot, hurricane prone island off Florida and most of the action takes place in one room of a rundown hotel. The atmosphere this creates is predictably claustrophobic and oppressive and also has the effect of heightening the intensity of everything that happens in its confined environment. The screenplay was based on Maxwell Anderson's 1939 play of the same name but the changes made by John Huston and Richard Brooks also made the story much more topical for the audiences who saw the movie soon after its release in 1948.Shortly after the Second World War, ex-army major Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) travels to the island of Key Largo to visit the family of George Temple who had served under his command in Italy and been killed in action. At the hotel run by George's father, James (Lionel Barrymore) and his widow, Nora (Lauren Bacall), Frank describes the circumstances which surrounded George's demise and the grateful family invite him to stay for the night.The hotel is officially closed for the off-season but is temporarily occupied by a small group of people who turn out to be the infamous gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G Robinson), his henchmen and his mistress, Gaye Dawn (Claire Trevor). The only other person in the building is Clyde Sawyer (John Rodney) who's a Deputy Sheriff who'd been caught and beaten up by the gang whilst hunting for two Amreican Indians (the Osceola brothers) who'd recently escaped from prison.Rocco is awaiting the visit of another gangster and is due to complete a deal involving counterfeit money before returning to Cuba. His plans are disrupted when a hurricane warning is received and his contact's arrival is delayed by the weather.As the storm grows outside, Frank and the Temples are held at gunpoint by Rocco who amuses himself by trying to needle him into using it to shoot the gangster who also has a gun pointed at Frank. When Frank tosses the gun away, he's seen as a coward by Nora but when Sawyer picks up the gun and tries to escape, he's unable to defend himself because the gun has no bullets in it and the gangster kills him.Similar brutish behaviour follows as Rocco makes a pass at Nora (and she spits in his face) and he also humiliates the alcoholic Gaye by making her sing for a drink and then refuses to give her one. When the storm builds up, Rocco's normal threatening and cruel behaviour changes and he becomes fearful and very agitated.After the storm passes, Sheriff Ben Wade (Monte Blue) calls by and finds Sawyer's body outside the hotel. Rocco tells him that the Deputy was killed by the Osceola brothers who are nearby and when the Sheriff pursues them, they try to escape and he kills them both. Rocco and his men discover that their boat has disappeared and in order to enable them to escape, force Frank to pilot the Temples' boat to Cuba and this leads to the story's dramatic ending.A powerful theme of entrapment runs through the action as the Temples and Frank are held hostage by Rocco's gang and everyone in the hotel is trapped by the storm. James Temple is confined to a wheelchair and Gaye Dawn is trapped by her dependency on Rocco and alcohol. Sawyer was held captive by the gang and Frank is a prisoner of the psychological effects he's suffering as a result of his experiences in the war.The quality of the main characters' lives has also deteriorated. Rocco's status as a criminal has diminished because of the ending of prohibition and his exile from the United States, Gaye's alcoholism has taken its toll on her singing talent and her looks, James Temple has become disabled, Nora has been widowed and Frank is struggling to come to terms with the profound feelings of disillusionment and cynicism which are the legacy of his time in the Army. All of this is reflected by the appearance of the hotel which has also obviously seen better days.The characters in \"Key Largo\" are particularly memorable and the acting is consistently top class. Robinson is immense as the menacing mobster who is also a coward. Bogart is brilliant as the war veteran who finds it difficult to settle back down into civilian life and Claire Trevor is impressive in her Oscar winning role as the alcoholic gangster's moll whose addiction has transformed her into a pathetic shadow of her former self. Bacall portrays Nora's range of moods convincingly and Barrymore gives a strong performance exuding a mixture of sadness and pride on hearing about his son's exploits abroad and then almost bursting with anger and frustration during the siege.\"Key Largo\" features the final Bogart and Bacall on-screen collaboration and the famous chemistry between them is evident throughout. In deference to the circumstances of their characters, however, their feelings for each other are seen to develop in a way which is very subtle and steady.",

It turns out that they have rented the hotel for a fishing holiday, but after an alcoholic woman they are with, Gaye Dawn (Claire Trevor), is manhandled by one of the group, Frank starts to suspect that there is more going on than it first seemed. With a hurricane approaching, Temple closes the hotel to wait out the storm, but the arrival of notorious gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) and his injured police officer prisoner, confirms Frank's fears.John Huston made many films in his long Hollywood career, and this was the last of four films that Bogart and Bacall made together, but Key Largo is far from the most fondly remembered of all their films. Yet although it doesn't achieve true greatness, especially when you compare it to the likes of Huston's masterpieces The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) and The African Queen (1951), the talent on display allows it to be a tense, visually striking and occasionally riveting little film noir. The theatrical roots (it was adapted from Maxwell Anderson's 1938 play) of the film means the scale is minimal, but if nothing adds to the sweaty, closed-in atmosphere, all rendered beautifully by Karl Freund's cinematography, and Huston and Richard Brooks' script gives plenty for the cast to chew on, especially the colossal Robinson and the Academy Award-winning Trevor.Although he comes second in the credits, Robinson dominates the film when he enters about twenty minutes in. He lies sprawled in the bath chomping a huge cigar, like a revolting beached animal, and emerges to truly push Bogart out of the limelight. Even the opening title sequence reflects this, with Robinson's name higher than Bogart's. It's an alarmingly restrained performance from Bogart, who we are all used to as either the bad guy, or the tough anti-hero, and Bacall is disappointingly mute, her character being no more than the put-upon love interest when will always be remembered for playing the sultry femme fatale.Robinson dominates, but Trevor steals the show as Rocco's boozy, gambling ex-star girlfriend, who is the figure of desperation when Rocco masochistically makes her sing for everybody for a drink. She sings a story of a woman abused by her partner, and breaks down during the climax. Rocco, affected by the similarity, refuses her a drink anyway, only to have Frank pour her a hard drink and hand it to her, enraging Rocco. It's a great scene, and most likely the scene than won Trevor the Oscar. It is the quality of the acting, and some fine technical work that really bring the B-movie plot to life, as well as Huston's ability to craft an exciting, yet dark thriller.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",

            "content": "With an all-star cast from the period- Bogie, Bacall, EG Robinson, Lionel Barrymore- and one of the most successful studio auteur's ever, John Huston, it's not too much to wonder that there is a bit of a high expectation before watching a film like Key Largo. I watched it very late one night, and did not feel tired for a moment. This is the kind of thriller that takes its time in the storytelling with enough attitude and specific scenes with pathos that add to its appeal. Bogie's character comes down to Florida to see an old friend, an old man in Lionel Barrymore. It's at a hotel that also features Barrymore's daughter, played by Bacall, and Claire Trevor as well. But then gangsters, led by Rocco (Rosbinson), break in holding everyone hostage, even as a hurricane rages on outside.I would be inclined to note, as some other reviewers have, that the tendency for Robinson &/or Bogart to go with scenery chewing is almost a given of the dish that's served. But for fans of the two iconic masculine Hollywood figures, Key Largo is an essential viewing. Robinson especially has one of his very best turns as Rocco, a gangster without much remorse or sympathy, though some of his weaker side starts to show as the hurricane outside impedes further on their plans. A lot of the film, in actuality, is talk, and the film was even once a play. What Huston as a director is able to get right are the subtleties of certain scenes (even Bogart's presence as a star is subdued at times with its supporting players, especially Barrymore). One that stands out for me is when Robisnon forces Trevor to sing, which she does with more emotion and fear than talent. I also loved the way the people outside of the hotel were left to fend against the storm and Rocco's insistence to keep them out- rather tragic in the midst of the rest of the story, really.But, when the film does pick up the pace with the action or thrills, the audience is not left unsatisfied after many scenes of back and forth dialog that rings as very 'movie-like' (\"You don't like it, do you Rocco, the storm? Show it your gun, why don't you? If it doesn't stop, shoot it.) The scenes towards the end on the boat are some of the better scenes Huston's done with the tension and excitement that he can stir up in his thrillers. Key Largo in the end turns up to be one of those full-on classics of the Hollywood Golden age that may not be seen as much as some of the other Bogart films or even his work with Bacall (I would bet more have seen The Big Sleep than Key Largo). But I would definitely say for future filmmakers who want to get into the action genre or the blockbuster to take a look at this picture, that starts off with solid characterization- that we truly care about the good guys and despise the bad guys- and concludes with a good bang. And some hefty atmosphere on part of the hurricane doesn't hurt either. Grade: A",

Bogart, as had become his screen persona, IS the reluctant hero. Edward G. Robinson is unforgettable as arguably the ultimate gangster (though Bogart himself and James Cagney would undoubtedly contest him for the title). Lauren Bacall's role isn't as prominent as in some of the other films she costarred with Bogart but nevertheless she is more than competent. I think Claire Trevor won a best supporting actress for her role as the lush dame in this film. The rest of the supporting cast is also top notch and is unusually memorable for secondary characters. That's a credit to both the screenwriters and the actors. One of my top twenty films of all time, 10/10.",

The material is just as tub-thumbingly preachy as we would expect from Anderson; we're still dealing with the struggle between good, (Bogie, Bacall and Lionel Barrymore), and evil (Edward G, Thomas Gomez and various henchmen), set in an hotel in Key Largo during a literal and metaphorical hurricane. Caught in the middle is Claire Trevor's lush Gaye Dawn. She won the film's only Oscar and gets to sing \"Moanin' Low\".The difference between this and other Anderson adaptations is in the handling, in the superb cinematography by the great Karl Freund and in most of the casting. Bogart's character is too much a mouth-piece for decency, Bacall is still insipid and Barrymore is still his usual hammy self but Robinson is magnificent as is Gomez and Trevor is simply iconic. Of course, it's \"The Petrified Forest\" all over again only this time Bogie is on the side of the angels and it's still a second-rate play but thanks to Huston, a second-rate play has become a first-rate film.",

While Key Largo is in most ways a lighter noir, it still creates a great amount dread and ominous situations, all a tribute to John Huston's wonderful direction here. Key Largo re-teamed Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall for the 4th and final time and it is yet another gem in their resumes. Lionel Barrymore, Edward G. Robinson, and Claire Trevor round out a tremendously talented cast. It helps that Key Largo is based on a play which gives the actors plenty of room to thrive in this crime drama film noir. Trevor won the Oscar for supporting actress and she's incredible, but Barrymore never fails to amaze me in a wheelchair. Between this, You Can't Take it With You, and It's a Wonderful Life, he has gave me some of the most enjoyable movie experiences, so thank you Mr. Barrymore.The film delves into a man's (Bogart) post World War II trip to his friends hotel when they are stranded with a bunch of gangsters during a hurricane. The premise itself thrives as a stage production by it also manages to give us an engaging and thrilling cinematic experience as well. I love how there is never any real assurance from the writing or direction that this film will be a happy ending, which makes it such a great noir. A hurricane and a bunch of gangsters? The only actor qualified for such circumstances has to be the one and only Humphrey Bogart.In all seriousness, Key Largo is a really good film. With a setting that sticks to the confinement of the hotel for 90% of the film, I can't speak highly enough of the directing and acting. It's difficult to make an action film with plenty of vivacious settings to be engaging for 90 minutes but Key Largo manages to it with one hotel, that's impressive. The character arcs of both Robinson's Johnny Rocco and Bogart's Frank Mcloud are interestingly paralleled. Both have nowhere to go or fit in and they both plenty of desires and hopes. To me, the scenes between both of them were the most fascinating. So overall, Key Largo is a classic. It gives you everything you want from a noir standpoint, while also creating a solid crime thriller in the process.+Direction+Barrymore always steals the show+Noir elements8.7/10",

            "content": "A simply sensational claustrophobic thriller from director John Huston, and far better than his more acclaimed and remembered film from the same year, \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre.\" Humphrey Bogart plays a war hero who pays a call on the father and widow of a dead buddy at the hotel they own and operate on Key Largo. The absolutely smashing Edward G. Robinson plays Mr. Brown, a mobster who has holed up at the hotel with his gang while he awaits payment from another group of mobsters. A hurricane hits and the group are trapped inside while tensions mount, almost to an unbearable pitch. Huston fills the movie chock-full of memorable moments and frames shots brilliantly to make the audience feel the sweltering humidity and oppression of the tropical locale. Robinson tears up the character of Mr. Brown, playing him as a relic from a past age; it's as if his character from \"Little Caesar\" found himself transplanted forward fifteen years to a world that has passed him by. But it's his insecurity and eagerness to still prove himself top dog that makes him so dangerous. Lauren Bacall mostly fades into the background as the widow, but Bogart does great work as the steely hero. Lionel Barrymore is also memorable as the benevolent hotel owner who is literally unable to stand up to Mr. Brown (though he does so in his heart), and Claire Trevor won an Oscar for her portrayal of Mr. Brown's drunken floozy of a girlfriend, the kind of whore with a heart of gold character the Academy has always loved to recognize.The brooding atmosphere is topped off by a thrilling Max Steiner score.

Whether the bad guys will succeed, or get what they deserve, will depend on the courage and resourcefulness of one man ...     \"Key Largo\" was the second Bogart-Bacall project, and to watch the film is to be left in no doubt that these two are a couple.  Their silently-exchanged look of love, sitting on the lobby carpet, is a piece of cinema magic.  Earlier, when tying-up the boat, they function naturally as a team.  Watch how Bogey draws closer to Bacall by hauling on her rope.     Bogart plays Major Frank McCloud, the war hero who has turned into a drifter.  He has made his way down to Key Largo to pay his respects Nora, the widow of one of his men, killed in action at Monte Cassino.     Also staying in the family-run hotel is a bunch of Illinois hoods involved in a money-counterfeiting scam.  Their leader is Johnny Rocco (Edward G Robinson), deported from America some years earlier as an undesireable alien, and now making a surreptitious comeback via Cuba.  The mobsters look and feel grotesquely out of place on the Key, urban gutter-rats polluting a natural paradise.  Old man temple refers to them contemptuously as \"You city filth!\"  The strong northern accents and inappropriate clothing of the mobsters emphasise the sense of their 'wrongness'.  Johnny Rocco's respiratory problems in the Southern humidity are symbolically important.  In every sense, he doesn't belong here.     The villains have captured and tortured young Sawyer, a decent local cop.  They will have to make their getaway before the search for Sawyer brings the authorities to the hotel.     A hurricane is sweeping in from the Gulf.  The storm stands as an image of the gangsters and their sudden, violent invasion.  In a scene of sombre foreboding, Frank goes around the hotel closing all the shutters, narrowing down the world inhabited by the occupants.  An extended family of Seminole indians has come in from the mangroves to shelter in the hotel.  Old man Temple has always made them welcome during hurricanes, but now Rocco ruthlessly excludes them, abandoning them to fare as best they can in the storm.  The no-good alien, constantly bleating about America's inhospitality towards him, shuns the true Americans mercilessly.     Gaye Dawn (played by Claire Trevor, who died recently) was a beautiful woman a few short years ago.  Now she is a broken-down alcoholic, a gangster's moll with no dignity and no prospects.  Johnny humiliates her for amusement, forcing her to sing in return for a drink.  She knows that her association with Rocco has ruined her.  She sings, \"What Have I Gone And Done?\"     Rocco keeps his malevolent underlings in place by constantly confronting each one, and extracting professions of loyalty.  Each of the mobsters in turn has to undergo the ritual degradation.  Rocco seems all-powerful in this little universe of the battened-down hotel, but Nora understands Frank, and knows that he will not accept vasseldom.  \"The cause isn't lost as long as someone is willing to go on fighting.\"     The screen images are assembled in tight compositions of almost painterly sensibility (watch for the grouping of figures as Toots reads the newspaper jokes).  An excellent long tracking shot sweeps down the staircase as Frank, silent and tight-lipped, endures the garbage spouted by the fat man.  Extreme close-ups help establish a mood of great tension as the inmates wait for the storm to hit.  Clever back-lighting picks out the craggy features of Bogart in the murk of the beleaguered hotel.  Rocco is shot in silhouette as he whispers smut to Nora, the very incarnation of an evil angel.     The hurricane passes, and hope returns.  Nora throws open the shutter, allowing daylight to stream into her life once more.  The nightmare has passed.  \"There'll be little to remind you of what happened tonight.\"",

The screenplay was adapted from a stage play so that means there's only a limited number of settings and the characters, especially the supportive ones, sometimes seem a little basic. Yet this is no restraint for a skilled director like Huston, as he patiently builds up the intrigue and tension towards a terrific anti-climax (the hurricane). Like only he can pull it off, Humphrey Bogart plays an embittered man who, shortly after the war, visits the relatives of a fellow soldier who got killed in action. The Temples own a small hotel on an island off the coast of Florida, where also a lot of Indians live and the menace of tropical hurricanes is constant. Just at the time when Bogie is about to score with beautiful widow Bacall, the hotel is taken over by Italian mafia boss Johnny Rocco and his henchmen, and he's pretty damn angry because the American government wants to deport him. \"Key Largo\" contains a large amount of dared and effective criticism towards political corruption and the American legal system and it's surprising how the post-WWII heroism of Bogart's character is minimized. This is a very sober film which emotional impact largely only begins to show after the movie is over. The acting is downright terrific with, apart from Bogart and Bacall who always connect greatly, powerful roles for Lionel Barrymore and particularly Edward G. Robinson as the almighty personification of organized crime. Claire Trevor's Oscar-winning performance as the disillusioned gangster puppet is truly memorable as well. Essential viewing!",

The build up of tension between the main characters is set well against the backdrop of the impending storm seemingly threatening to cave their hotel in literally and figuratively. Frank's character arc from jaded passiveness to the restrained heroism he is inescapably drawn towards has been seen in other Bogie characters, but usually those guys were either willing participants on the trigger end of their guns, or they were fulfilling their own agendas as well. However Frank McCloud has no ulterior motives. Here, there is a refreshing change from the usual Bogie-isms; Frank doesnt engage in any verbal bravado with Rocco, there are no confident smirks on his face, or promises to 'get even' later. As for Barrymore, he was just simply an acting genius. Look no further than the scene with him getting out of his wheelchair in a futile attempt to fight Rocco as proof. Fantastic. E.G. Robinson delivers his vitriol so well on-screen, you cant help but hate his guts and wait for his come-uppance.

            "content": "Gangster Edward G. Robinson and a handful of goons take over a hotel on the Florida keys. The hotel is run by Lionel Barrymore and his widowed daughter-in-law, Lauren Bacall. Humphrey Bogart, the hotel's only guest, is an ex-soldier who was a friend of Bacall's husband during the war. The plot involves chiefly the conflict between Robinson, the boss who knows exactly what he wants, and Bogart, who lost any ideals he might have had during the war in Italy. A secondary story has the minions of the law running in and out searching for a pair of miscreant Seminoles. The drama is heightened by the arrival of a dangerous hurricane at the end of the second act.The movie is resolutely middle brow. Everything you need to know is spelled out for you. What does Robinson really want? \"More.\" And does Bogart know what HE wants? \"I used to have dreams but I gave them up.\" (Something like that.) This isn't high drama. This is vernacular art. Every character we meet is either good or evil. Oh, I suppose Bogart has some doubts about being a hero, but we know what will happen before the end of the movie rolls around.The single exception is Gaye Dawn (nee Maggie Rooney), played by Claire Trevor, whose character is reasonably complex and who shows some development that isn't entirely predictable. She won an Academy Award for her performance, and she deserved it. Not just for the scene in which she, as a pathetic drunk, agrees to sing \"Moanin' Low\" for a shot of scotch, but for the far more subtle ways in which she signals her character's thoughts and emotions. Her slightest glances are given meaning.The movie is shot by director Huston mostly as a staged play. It's just as well because the special effects, mostly models, seen during the hurricane are pretty sleazy by today's standards. It's far spookier with everyone scattered around the hotel lobby, the bad guys shaking in their boots, listening to the wind ululate, staring at the swinging chandeliers and gaping as the walls practically billow inward, tumbling the liquor glasses off the shelves behind the bar.Is there a moral in tow? Nah. Not really. Bogart learns that the war was worth fighting. Robinson, who is playing Lucky Luciano in the closet, learns that you can't kill Nature with a bullet. Robinson is great, by the way. Huston has him made up to look like a caricature of himself. I swear he's wearing lip rouge. And he's got those lips wrapped around a huge phallic cigar when Huston introduces him. He's given a chance to sneer \"Mnyeah\" a couple of times too. He resembles the cartoon figure of himself that appeared occasionally in the Bugs Bunny shorts that Warners produced. You have to love it when he whispers inaudible obscenities into the unsullied ears of the rapturously beautiful Bacall.The dialog, which I take it comes mainly from Maxwell Anderson's play, sounds as if it were written by a guy who knows absolutely nothing about real gangsters of the 1920s and 30s, although he may have seen many movies about them. \"Say, boss, I wonder if it was such a good idea to leave Dawn behind. She might squeal.\" And, \"I betcha prohibition comes back, only this time the mobs will work together instead of blastin' each other.\" At the end, when the stage of ejaculatory inevitability is reached and Bogart improbably offs all the bad guys while at sea, he radios \"Nan Mike Able\" for assistance. That was the U. S. Coast Guard radio station in Miami. Then there is a cut back to the hotel, where Bacall gets a phone call from Bogart telling her he's coming back. Then another cut to Bogart -- smiling but still at sea in the Santana. How do you make a phone call from a fishing vessel? Especially when the phone is dead? (What, then, did the hand of the potter shake?)Immensely enjoyable stuff.",

It's got some of the best elements from all the great film noir's, plus an amazing cast and an added \"exotic\" location.Like the claustrophobic and sweaty Deep South melodramas from Tennessee Williams and such, Key Largo has lashings of ripe and heated verbal conflict, kidnapping and colourful characters, complete with an impending hurricane, just to spice things up further.Whilst it might not have the iconic visuals, or classic lines of that other Bogart/John Huston classic 'The Maltese Falcon', Key Largo is actually easier to watch and easier to follow. And as with any film pairing the Hollywood Golden couple of Bogart & Bacall, it remains essential viewing for any self-respecting film lover.A run-down Florida hotel is taken over by a gang of thugs and their mobster boss, (an excellent, sociopathic Edward G Robinson, who reprises his mega sinister 'Little Caesar' role) and his pathetic alcoholic floozy, an Oscar-winning Claire Trevor. Wheelchair-bound James Temple, the Hotel owner, played by the reassuring Lionel Barrymore and his daughter, Nora, played by Lauren Bacall try to handle this assault on their personal freedom but it soon gets out of hand. She's the widow of a WW2 buddy of Humphrey Bogart's character, who died in action and who Bogart visits out of respect.Notorious 'public enemy', nasty criminal, Johnny Rocco, presumed dead by some and his cronies is making his escape with loads of loot in the Keys when the winds whip up and so they take refuge in the resort. There's a battle of wits, followed by a battle of guns, bombardment by crashing palm trees and ferocious storms and then a finally a mad rush to escape (again) with the concluding final battle of everything between Robinson and Bogart.It's all entertaining nonsense, really but with more than a dash of bravado and plenty of action toward the end. I think it's an overlooked, under-appreciated gem, far from perfect but one that still glints and continues to catch my eye.",

            "content": "\"Key Largo\" is an American 100-minute movie from 1948, so this one will have its 70th anniversary next year. At this age, it is of course a black-and-white (sound) film. It is one of the more known works from the film noir genre and also by writer and director John Huston, who scored one of his many Oscar nominations for his work here briefly before winning twice in the same year. The main character is played by the legendary Humphrey Bogart, a man returning to a hotel to talk to a fellow soldier's girl about her late love and also to meet an old friend. But he finds a great deal of trouble there as gangsters have gained control over the place. As a result of that, almost the entire film is a hostage situation and with all the trouble inside, things outside are not looking much better as a dangerous hurricane is moving closer and closer.Bogart does a solid job overall, but it is a character that is not too demanding. The biggest letdown is Bacall here though, who was already married to Bogart at that point. She plays the widow and honestly the film would have been the exact same without her, maybe even better as that moment when she looks at Bogart during the song is a bit cringeworthy. Shouldn't she be mourning her man instead? In general, the film lacks shades quite a bit. The characters are either 100% good people or 100% bad people with the exception of Claire Trevor. This may also have helped her in winning her Oscar here as she plays a character who is relatively close to the gangsters' boss, but has turned into a wreck of her former self because of alcohol, smoking and gambling. The moment she sings is only a brief return to her former glory days as she really only does it to get some booze as a reward. She really is the only one with some character development as we see her beg her boss not to leave her behind, but then she quickly becomes one of the good guys at the very end. This also shows that she wasn't really evil, but just a victim of her situation. I still have to see many more 1948 films to decide if she really is the best from that year.It's either her who is the most interesting character here or Edward G. Robinson's who dreams of bringing back the old days of crime and becoming truly influential again. But it is obvious he is really only strong thanks to his gun and has nothing that makes him an even match for Bogart's character. Even his henchmen do not seem to take him seriously all the time and maybe they still are the aftermath of the old days, but you can see them drifting apart too. Maybe it is the great deal of screen time and the question if he was lead or supporting that kept Robinson here from becoming an Oscar nominee too. A bit of a pity. As for the film itself, I would not rate it as highly as it stands here on IMDb, but it was a fairly interesting and tense watch from start to finish. Definitely worth checking out for those who love the old days of Hollywood, even if they probably did already. So maybe it is actually a good start for those who want to find out if this era in filmmaking is to their liking. It's a thumbs-up and I suggest you go for it.",

They try to dissuade Bogart, but he persists in meeting crippled old Lionel Barrymore (as James Temple) and his beautiful daughter Lauren Bacall (as Nora).

            "content": "With a cast that includes Bogart, Edward G Robinson, and Lauren Bacall all in one film, was there ever any doubt this was going to be worth seeing? Key Largo's plot concerns itself with Bogart playing a major in the military who visits the family of a friend who served with him in the italian campaign during the second world war. However, things don't go as planned for the charismatic officer, and a hurricane soon begins to close in on the Floridian island where the characters are staying. Soon, it makes itself known that he has wandered into a trap, and Bogart is taken hostage by the men he thought he was on good terms with. They then reveal that the last member of their gang is the notorious gangster Johnny Rocco, played by Robinson, who is waiting for someone to arrive so he can settle a deal. The tension between Bogart, Rocco, and Rocco's henchmen is put to good effect, and especially entertaining to watch since the former major and Rocco are played by two epitomes of excellence. In one part, Edward G Robinson slaps Bogart in the face simply because he can, and Robinson was probably the only person alive brazen enough to do such a thing. Towards the end of the film, Robinson gets the huge amount of money that he was originally promised in his deal, and demands Bogart to use a boat to take him back to Cuba, which doesn't end well for Robinson as Bogart uses a stolen gun acquired earlier to kill him and his cronies. To put it simply, this movie has a somewhat convoluted storyline that can be confusing at times because there are so many things going on, but with such great performances from Bogart and Robinson, there's really no reason you shouldn't watch this at least once.",

            "content": "With a great cast headed by Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, and Edward G. Robinson, and a story and setting filled with tension, \"Key Largo\" has much to offer.  It provides some fine atmospheric drama and some great acting that make us forget its comparatively minor defects.Director John Huston makes us feel part of the setting, bringing us to the island of Key Largo and to a resort hotel on the island that is in the middle of its slow season.  Bogart is an army officer back from World War II, who has come to the hotel to see the family of one of the men who died while serving under him.  The hotel is run by the dead soldier's father and widow, but has been largely taken over by a sinister looking group headed by Edward G. Robinson.  When a hurricane comes, there is tension of every kind, as Robinson's gang becomes openly threatening.  Meanwhile, a group of local Indians is seeking shelter from the hurricane, while the local sheriff is trying to find two of the Indians who have broken out of jail.  The damage and fear caused by the hurricane is an effective parallel to the conflicts among the characters.Bogart is in his element as the disillusioned war hero who wants to stay out of trouble, but who finds himself in a situation where only he can help. This is the kind of character Bogart played better than anyone.  Bacall's character is not as interesting as the ones she played in her other films with Bogart, but she is good in her role.The acting in \"Key Largo\" is so good that you don't notice, unless you think about it, that most of the other characters are rather stereotyped. Robinson's fine (as always) acting turns a routine gangster character into a real presence, Claire Trevor is memorable as his drunken, mistreated girl, and Lionel Barrymore gives lots of life to some often lame dialogue in his role as the hotel owner.The fine acting and the tropical, stormy setting make the most out of the drama as it is played out.  It all leads up to an ending that is exciting, though perhaps a bit implausible.  Despite a few imperfections, it is one of the best films of its kind.",

            "review_title": "The fascinating paradox of \"Key Largo\" : a salvation key for its entrapped souls ...",
            "content": "Released in 1948, John Huston's \"Key Largo\" is a Post-War movie. Obviously. In this suffocating behind-closed-doors thriller, the moral relics of the War sweats out the characters' pores, with the obligatory evil : Johnny Rocco, played by an exquisitely confident Edward G. Robinson, and a self-doubting good side incarnated by a former WW2 veteran: Bogart as Frank McCloud, Lionel Barrymore as the father of his ill-fated Army buddy George, and as Nora, the precocious widow, Lauren Bacall in her fourth and final co-starring with her legendary husband.Swinging between, there's Oscar-winning Clair Trevor as Rocco's moll, Gaye Dawn, desperately seeking for a last drop of alcohol, how much she drinks says a lot about the wounded past she has to conceal, something Frank, the only one to give him a drink, can relate to. A former idealist probably, Frank had to fight with the assurance that his death would have a meaning: clearing the world of its poisoning vileness and barbarity. Yet Rocco stands for everything Frank fought against and is very much alive and cynically proud of his achievement.Men like Rocco highlight the pointlessness of George's death and that's what the Film-Noir genre is about, disillusion, the same after the victory's euphoria was toned down by the uncertainty of the world's fate, at the dawn of the Atomic Age. Who could put his faith in human nature after that? \"Key Largo\" is one of the most quintessential film-noir. War is the prominent shadow of Frank's past and the light of hope is this visit to Florida, an escape from the pessimism inherited from the past and the certitude that George's death was the ransom for a better world, seeking the real Post-war peace, peace of mind, but the light at the end of the tunnel might be of a passing train, a train named Johnny Rocco who'd confront Frank to the very demons he's escaping from.And in the pivotal moment when Rocco dared Frank to shoot him, Frank chose to drop his gun. There would be plenty of Roccos to take his place anyway, like the War didn't deprive the world from scum or evil. For long as there will be men, there will be wicked ones, so why should the good ones die to leave room for them? That dilemma is perfectly captured by Gaye Dawn's line \"Better to live a coward or die a hero\", which in Frank's mind resonates as, \"calculated weakness can be more resourceful than pointless bravery\". There's no point in heroism if it's deemed to fail, it's as meaningless as being called a coward.If not a hero, Frank is an existential character, because his life is worthier than his cause, if only to better serve the cause. It's not the action that counts, it's the one you do according to your personal beliefs. Basically, Frank's self-preservation commanded him not to waste his life for Rocco or for the sake of peer pressure. And who could ever think of him as a coward? Whether for giving a drink, taking a few slaps (and what slaps!) and shielding Nora, Frank never acted brave, he was brave ... something he might've learned from the War, like Patton said \"you don't win a war by dying for a country, but by making the other bastard die\".George might've been a hero, but it was Frank smelling Florida coolest breezes and toying with Nora's beautiful hair. Life isn't an act, it's reality and reality commands to accept some bits of failure, the quintessential Hustonian theme. All Huston movies are about characters who try to escape from their inner condition but fail because they're essentially tragic. Rocco's success was Frank's failure, the living incarnation of his bitterness and anger toward the world. But being a failure is one thing but no Hustonian character is a loser, the relative quietness of Frank is only the silence before the storm, after the real one would be over.Indeed, Frank knew that he had to fight no matter what, postponing the time of the confrontation wouldn't avoid it and it's only after Rocco kills the innocent Indians (Sawyer took a chance and wasn't a 'civilian') that Frank makes up his mind. He knows killing Rocco won't change anything, but not killing him would leave a much more indelible stain in his soul. He had to act, that was his destiny as a fighter, a soldier, a man of morality who wouldn't let the killing of the two innocents get unpunished. An existential character gives a meaning to his acts, but paradoxically, believes that he's got but one destiny. He chooses what to do but most times, there's only one thing to do.And the climax conveys the fascinating paradox. Frank, now dispassionate, cold and methodical, eliminates the bad guys one by one, killing the last demon who'd ever have to torture his soul. This is the light of excitement that ignite Bogie's eyes while staring at that door from the boat's rooftop before Rocco would show his face for a last time. He knows he's going to accomplish himself once and for all and really escape from his tormented past. Escapism is another symbolic device in Huston's oeuvre, full of people trying to transcend their own condition yet their quest for freedom or success lead them to a physical or moral entrapment.There's something of Fred C. Dobbs in Frank McCloud, something of The \"Night of the Iguana\" in \"Key Largo\", people isolated and entrapped to give the word 'escape' its fullest meaning. Frank wouldn't find peace in Florida but also the peace of this soul. A hurricane is ravaging the outside, but the climate is even more dangerous in the inside. It's escapism as the quest for any trapped soul and entrapment for any soul trying to escape its condition, you've got to earn it, whether you lose or fail. \"Key Largo\" was Frank's key to his own salvation.",

Edw. G.

Bogart provides a terrific psychological study of a post WW2-veteran struggling to adapt to society once more. It's one of his best performances, and provides him with a chance to show his impressive range. Bogart didn't just play himself over and over again. Every cynical outsider he plays is different, with Bogart bringing more to the role than just his incredible presence.Edward G. Robinson is terrific also as the gangster who holes Bogart, Bacall, Robinson and Trevor up in the motel Key Largo on one eventful night. He is repulsive, and representative of the old-style greed and power-hungry figure that Americans grew to detest after the War. He battles Bogart in this film, and there's no doubt as to who our hero is.The great Lionel Barrymore is, well, great as the wheelchair-bound owner of the motel Robinson holds up. One can only imagine the reaction of an American audience, accustomed to watching Barrymore act in a wheelchair for many years, to Barrymore's wobbly rise to his legs. Trevor's performance was Oscar-winning, and she certainly is scene-stealing as the drunken floozy who Robinson relentlessly bullies. Bacall is is fine form as Nora Templeton, war widow and daughter-in-law of Barrymore.The Bogart-Bacall teaming is used to marvelous effect again in their last screen outing together. It's a tender, tentative love we are watching evolve (Bogart and Bacall don't actually lock lips in this film), based on mutual need and growing affection. Nora is weary like Frank McCloud, and their lies the equality essential to every Bacall-Bogart film.Great camera-work, and fine sense of atmosphere from Huston. Filmed basically in one building, 'Key Largo' certainly conveys film noir's central thematic elements of pessimism, disillusionment, mistrust and danger.Definitely a classic.9/10.",

I don't get all of the social cues that are going on. I have no idea what the subtext of all the dialogue is. And yet, I've gotten used to certain patterns over time. I can tell when something's about to go down or if a character's lying or pushing buttons. Still, words aren't needed for certain facial expressions, you can immediately tell what someone is feeling or thinking.Most of this movie takes place in a hotel. Something comes up and some gangsters are forced to reveal themselves and take the guests and owners as hostages. They don't want any trouble. But then a hurricane comes and things get more complicated. Nobody can leave, at least for a while. Maybe someone will try to be a hero or talk smart. The tension builds.Johnny Rocco is a famous gangster (based on Al Capone and Lucky Luciano) who all the regular people despise. So much so that some of them can't keep it to themselves in spite of the harm it might bring to them. Edward G. Robinson really gets into the role alternating between brutal coldness and smarmy talking. He's confident but Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) begins to see weaknesses, giving him some leverage. Frank talks logic, he thinks ahead and explains things.Key Largo seems to have a bit of a theme about war veterans in contrast with gangsters, these two extremes of Americans. The really noble, brave kind Vs. the heartless, selfish, evil kind. Frank (like every Bogart character) announces that he only cares about his own business and it seems true. But even he has to morally conclude that stopping someone like Rocco by any means could only be a good thing. This means he's willing to take some risks to harm Rocco which puts himself and the others in danger. I think there's a bit more emotion here from Bogart than usual. He even smiles a couple of times.The finale was pretty riveting and satisfying. It's always good when you're actually rooting for the good guys and you want the bad guys dead (because they're that bad). And you're on the edge of your seat because you hope things turn out well but know that anything could happen. It shows that you believe in and care about the characters.

            "content": "A bunch of Cuban mobsters show up on a small island in Florida. They don't reveal who they are. At the same time a man who served in WW2 shows up. He has served with the killed in action husband of a woman, Lauren Bacall, who works in the hotel on the island. The mobsters soon kidnap everyone in the hotel and the plot makes a big deal of Humphrey Bogart being brave enough or not to take on the mobsters. At the very end he does and kills them all.Frankly, it's a waste of time. It doesn't do anything new or fresh. This veteran shows up and the mistress falls in love with him in the very first scene. That's that. There is no relationship going on there. She just stares at him and this romance is never really brought up again. The mobsters also act like cowards. The boss himself, Rocco, let himself be kicked around. The woman spits him in the face. Bogart disobeys his orders and he just slaps him a bit. The guy is a wuss. Even a low level mafia boss would get you killed for shoving him. Look up Bath Avenue Crew from the 1990's. One young lower-tier mobster wanted a promotion for doing a kill. He showed a medium level boss in anger. 2 of his very best friends killed him. That's in the 1990's when such killing and rules subsided.The main issue is just that Rocco gets pushed around from start till end. The kidnapped group all get angry and make it dangerous for themselves. The Bacall spits on him and scratches him. Her dad fights him as well as he can and constantly calls him names and mocks him. Bogart mocks him and doesn't follow orders. A cop tries to escape from the hotel. His old girlfriend also irritates him constantly. He's just a loser. Not a single person is killed before these fools can't keep their mouths shut for merely 2 hours. The mobsters wanted to leave as soon as possible. Then the cop dies trying to escape a house full of mafia. Even though he is 100% safe in there. Then his partner shows up. Rocco tells him that the Indians were up to no good after he sees the dead body. His partner shots the 2 Indians after they try to run. What? He just shoots them? He doesn't get a death sentence for it? Are we acting like shooting 2 unarmed guys in the back is just fine? What is this movie? At least at the very end we have a mediocre gun fight. Bogart and all the others shoot from the hip only. They just shoot and pray they hit. Bogart was waiting for Rocco to walk out the door without even aiming the gun. What is this? Amateur hour?I also didn't like how everyone was constantly shouting. Overall it didn't feel real. The mobsters were stupid. But there was zero danger whatsoever at any point. Yet 3 innocent people died because they are all fools. It's a shame because there are good scenes too. You just have to remove all the kidnapping stuff that is 70% of the movie. None of it was real in any way. With the 2 Indians dying the movie jumped a shark too many for me. It makes zero sense. The cop didn't even know if they were innocent or not. He straight up shot them for no good reason and he wasn't presented as a bad guy. Similarly to how everyone else just acted suicidal. If the mobsters started killing right away it would make more sense. Or if they had killed the Indians. So many possible fixes.",

            "review_title": "Claustrophobic; strong performances",
            "content": "This movie has all the right ingredients, but falls down if \"movie claustrophobia\" bothers you. And that's the one real negative here. Almost all of the action takes place in one or two rooms of an old hotel, with occasional brief scenes outside to remind you you're at the Florida Keys and/or that there's a hurricane. Only the first 5 minutes of the film and the last 15 take place outside those couple of rooms at the hotel. As a result, there are times that it seems like an overly-talkative film with less action than you would expect from a team of actors including Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson. I had the same feeling when watching \"The Petrified Forest\" -- too much like a stage play.However, once you get past that \"movie claustrophobia\", there's lots to like here. Overall, the story is a good one. World War II has ended and ex-soldier Humphrey Bogart travels to Key Largo to visit the father (Lionel Barrymore) and wife (Lauren Bacall) of a soldier-friend who was killed in a battle. Barrymore and Bacall own an old hotel on Key Largo, and they unknowingly rented the place to a mobster (Edward G. Robinson) and his thugs who are waiting there for a counterfeit deal to take place. Robinson is an Italian mobster who was thrown out of the country, but hoping to return, and appears to currently be based in Cuba. Robinson is somewhat sadistic, particularly toward Bacall and his alcoholic ex-girlfriend (Claire Trevor). While waiting for the counterfeiters, a hurricane strikes, making things all the more tense. Once the deal goes down, Bogie is forced to sail the thugs back to Cuba. Will they make it, or will Bogie thwart them and return to fall in love with Bacall? This is a strong performance by Humphrey Bogart as a sort of anti-hero who seems to be balancing the need to be wise and not cowardly in dealing with the mobsters. A problem here is that Robinson shots him in the stomach several times in one scene, but the gun misfires or is not loaded. Why? One might say that Edward G. Robinson \"eats up the scenery\" as mobster Johnny Rocco. Another strong performance...or is it stereotypical of the era? If it is the latter, I'd prefer to blame it on the director, rather than Robinson.Lauren Bacall doesn't sizzle here...that would have been inappropriate. She's rather docile, and as a result less interesting than in her other film encounters with Bogart. But the role didn't call for sizzling; it called for a grieving wife.I'm not sure that Lionel Barrymore's character was appropriate, either. With his mouth, I would have expected him to be the first to be killed by Robinson. But again, Barrymore didn't write the script or direct the film, so I'll not blame him. Barrymore made 6 films after this, and was alive for 6 more years, but he looked very unwell and surprisingly fat in this film.Perhaps the best acting in the picture is by Claire Trevor as the alcoholic Gaye Dawn. The key to her Oscar winning supporting role was that she was careful not to overact her drunkenness, and as a result she gains the sympathy of the viewer here.Of the supporting actors, Thomas Gomez as one of the thugs is outstanding, giving a different characterization than one might expect; he was an accomplished character actor. The brash young punk role was played by Harry Lewis; I guess he was \"okay\". Marc Lawrence was somewhat interesting as one of the counterfeiters. Monte Blue is somewhat interesting as the overwhelmed local sheriff. You'll also recognize Jay Silverheels as one of the Indians in an uncredited role; Silverheels later became the much-beloved Tonto in \"The Lone Ranger\".The stage-like nature of this film prevents it from becoming a great film, but it's still quite good and definitely worth a watch.This viewing I watched the new Blu Ray release. While it's a \"good\" transfer, I'm not sure it was worth the upgrade from DVD. I've seen much better Blu Rays from the same era.",

            "review_title": "The gathering storm..",
            "content": "A fine solid psychological gangster movie, post-scripting the careers in this genre of two of the greats, Bogart and Robinson. Although the film ends with bullets and deaths a-plenty as Bogart finds the inner fibre he was lacking earlier under provocation, to take out Robinson and four of his gun-totin' goons (no mean feat), it's more about the clash of wills between Bogart and Robinson not to mention the changing emotions and loyalties of fine supporting characters such as Lionel Barrymore and Lauren Bacall as the wheelchair ridden old-timer and his army widow daughter as well of course the Oscar winning performance by Claire Trevor as Robinson's one-time moll, now callously ridiculed and discarded by him after being driven to drink by his treatment of her. Quite what point was of the two Indians who are mistakenly murdered by the cop on the trail of his murdered (at Robinson's hand) colleague, I'm not sure, but the film moves forward all the time, broodingly with the metaphor of the growing storm in the background, until the climax of Bogart's ultimate grace under pressure. The acting by the two leads is first rate, Robinson (whose character name Rocco coincidentally recalls his first major gangster role Rico in \"Little Caesar\") so completely \"The Man\", used to ordering his thugs around and treating everyone else as inferiors (especially the chilling scenes where he whispers menacingly but silently in Bacall's ear) and Bogart as another of his archetypal flawed heroes who finally does the right thing, no doubt inspired by the bravery of the Trevor, Barrymore and Bacall characters who in different ways stand up to Robinson. The direction by John Huston is sure and inventive, often using tracking shots to keep the plot moving and often involving dissolves into darkness, one particular scene where Bacall's face in close-up fades to black, being most memorable. However his job must have been made easier with the quality of the ensemble cast at his disposal.I did find Max Steiner's music distracting and detrimental to the narrative but I'm nit-picking now. Just a fine intelligent watchable movie from the old school, with many on board (in front of and behind the camera) on top form dramatising an interesting and suspenseful story.",

            "content": "\"That big gun in your hand makes you look grown-up, you think! I'll bet you spend hours posing in front of a mirror holding it.\"I really enjoyed this one. It's got a fantastic, atmospheric setting out on the Florida Keys during a storm at night, and a star-studded cast to say the least, with Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. Robinson, Lionel Barrymore, Lauren Bacall, and Claire Trevor. Bogart plays a vet visiting the family of an army buddy who was killed in the war (Barrymore is the father, Bacall the widow), and he stumbles into a group of gangsters led by Robinson and including Trevor as an alcoholic moll. A battle of wills develops, complicated by a pair of fugitive prisoners, an expected handoff of counterfeit money, and the raging storm. A quiet tension pervades the film, amplified by the isolation of the island and later out on a boat in the fog, and director John Huston moves things along with a good pace.Bogart is so assured and in command of his craft here, and turns in another brilliant performance (seems like I say that a lot about him!). Robinson and Barrymore exercise restraint and are rock solid as well, and the moment Barrymore got up out of his wheelchair briefly was riveting. Bacall is a teeny bit off in a couple scenes (the one where she tries to scratch Robinson's face comes to mind), but dials up suitable emotional intensity when she starts seeing the goodness in Bogart's world-weary and resigned character. One of the best scenes is when Trevor's character is humiliated into singing a song as a condition for getting a drink; it's brutal but she's wonderful in what's probably an unenviable role for actor, to sing in a way that reflects faded ability and glory (though she won an Oscar for it so....). Otherwise, the film embraces the virtues of the era - modesty, stoicism, and toughness - without creating cartoon characters, and I loved watching the emotional depth often shown only in subtle facial reactions.Members of the Seminole tribe are depicted in small roles and there may be some stereotypical broken English, but it's not awful I don't think, and they're sympathetic characters, unfairly accused at one point in a moment which certainly rang true. Near the end Barrymore's character laments that \"We can't do anything but harm to those people, even when we go to help them,\" which was nice, though undercut a little by getting the response that it wasn't him or \"the law or anybody; it was only Johnny Rocco.\" You see, we've been told earlier that Rocco is an Italian immigrant, and so by responding this way to the larger harm that Barrymore raises, it seems to put that at the doorstep of \"bad guys\"/immigrants. It's a small aspect of the film though, and maybe I'm reading too much into it. Regardless, the film had built up so much equity with me by then and it didn't lower my opinion of it.",

I know that compared to the other three, it is considered a \"lesser\" work, but it is my favorite Bogart. I am not going to write about the brilliance of all the performances in Key Large:  Lionel Barrymore, Lauren Bacall, Edward G. Robinson, and Claire Trevor.  Enough has been said about them all.  I wish to concentrate on Bogart and the loneliness of his character in the movie.Bogart often played damaged characters; i.e., men who had been hurt, badly hurt, at some time in the past.  Frank McCloud in Key Largo is one of those characters.  He is not a tough guy like Sam Spade or a \"sharp\" character like Rick.  He is a nice man and a very lonely one.  Frank has no family, he was an orphan.  He was an officer in the war, but the war is over.  He has no job, no family and no prospects.  He is tired; tired of being alone and tired of the violence of the war.But Frank has one dream, a borrowed dream. During the war, one of his men often told him stories of his own life with his father and wife and their small hotel in the Florida Keys.  It is a tale of family closeness and love, of clean salt air and colorful characters.  It is everything Frank has never had in his life.  After the war and the death of his friend, Frank has nowhere to go and nothing to look forward to.  So he finally drifts to Florida, to this family, to tell them how much he respected and liked his friend.They, Nora and Father Temple, are very glad to meet Frank.  Just as Frank had been told about them, they had been told about Frank in letters sent home from the war.  Into this comes Johnny Rocco and his goons and his moll. Frank is a decorated soldier and a brave man, there are too many innocent lives at stake, Nora and Mr. Temple and even Gaye Dawn, the alcoholic moll. Frank cares about these people, even Gaye, and he does not want them to be hurt and perhaps more than anyone else there, he knows the terrible devastation bullets can wreak on the human body.  This sets up the conditions for all the talk while they are trapped by the hurricane.  I will not say any more about twists of the plot because I do not want to include spoilers.Let me just say that in the end, Nora and Father Temple realize that they need Frank as much as Frank needs them.  And so Frank is finally able to come home.  He finally \"has it all ... in Key Largo.\"",

Both are about a disillusioned traveler caught up in a hostage situation during adverse weather conditions.Edward G. Robinson continues to play the ruthless sociopathic gangster that made him famous in LITTLE CAESAR. While he was usually entertaining in the older roles, here he is a more threatening and convincing menace. I find it remarkable how effectively he was able to portray those type of characters which were reportedly in sharp contrast to his real life persona. There are so many twists and turns in the story, that the first time viewers are never quite sure how the story will turn out or what will happen to the characters. \n(SPOILER: I am glad that Bogie's character was spared, unlike the characters of that type like in THE PETRIFIED FOREST or BULLETS OR BALLOTS).

Key Largo takes place on an island where a retired war hero goes to see his dead friend's family. He sees that a gangster is running things over there and it is causing everyone suffer a lot. The tension builds as the hero gest involved in it and had to find way but his so called thinking doesn't allow him to do. Therefore i had to use the word 'Coward'. But then Key Largo sets up for a Brave climax. John Huston is one quite filmmaker who always love to build atmosphere around the storyline. In most of his classics he did use all the properties, locations and characters to the priority. Even in Key Largo he sets all tones right. There is War period, there are gangster, there are poor people, there are good people, there are evil ones and then there a story which totally immerses everyone equally. Humphrey Bogart seems coward and i personally don't like to see him that way but as the matter of fact he had to be like that for the sake of the character. He still looks dashing enough whereas Lauren Bacall looks innocent. She doesn't get a chance to romance him but we can feel their inner bond. Edward G. Robinson as Johnny Rocco is in top form. He scored merits in this deadly villainous role while Claire Trevor as his dame does a fine job. Key Largo doesn't include heavy substances but all it got right is the basic morals of any common man. You had to fight even if your morals doesn't care for bad world. Key Largo succeeds in sending the message in gripping runtime of 100 minutes along with solid performances of fantastic four. The fifth one is John Huston, of course.RATING- 7/10*",

A place where people own as many boats as they do cars, there's only one main road, and it's never more than a five minute walk from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico, the Keys have a unique low-key atmosphere with a serene sense of quietness. The black-and-white photography did indeed live up to my expectations, bringing the Keys of fifty years ago to life. Going slightly out of order, I'll now give the basics of the story, which starts out with one of the most original first twenty minutes I've ever seen. Essentially, nothing really happens here, except we're just getting to know the characters who are conversing in a hotel lobby without the presence of conflict. You might call it an overly long exposition, but I enjoyed the pace of the film, because like the photography, the dialogue between the characters is very lifelike. After a sluggish pace, things pick up rather abruptly, as the bad guys starts shaking things up. As it turns out, several of the hotel guests are part of a vicious gang led by a the notorious mobster Rockom played by Edward G Robinson. I really enjoyed the fact that to compensate for Robinson being a little too small to be taken seriously on stage presence alone, there's a lot of hype about him before he actually appears on screen. Essentially, things turn into a hostage situation with Humphrey Bogart's army officer Frank McCloud as the group's best hope of saving the day. Reminiscent of 12 Angry Men or Hitchkock's Lifeboat, Key Largo is able to create tension and excitement within a very small space. The battle of wits between two highly-revered men, McCloud and Robinson, and the degree to which the film blows them both up, really adds a lot. There are also a number of scenes, which standing apart from the film, are very well-executed. For example, the arrival of a sheriff whose uninformed of the danger, really keeps us guessing, because we're not sure if anyone will confide anything to him, or even if they should. A lot of this is driven by Humphrey Bogart, whose natural ease translates into a guy who knows what he's doing. Bogart's character was literally never wrong in any move he made over the course of the movie. Looking back and pondering why this film didn't get more critical acclaim or make the AFI top 100 list, my guess is that there were just too many established Humphrey Bogart films on that list such as `Africa Queen', `Maltese Falcon', or `Casablanca.' Nevertheless, that's no excuse to overlook a movie like this one.",

I think I like her more here than \"To Have and Have Not\", though (the two are so similar, you have to compare them).Edward G. Robinson is added to the mix, which I think is another reason this film stands superior. Robinson has the noir and mobster parts down to a science. His work with Fritz Lang is amazing, but honestly he can hardly ever do anything wrong (nothing bad comes to mind just now).Cinematographer Karl Freund was on this film, and he's a genius. You need to see this film cleaned up to really get the full affect, but with Freund the camera was not just a tool, but an active part of the filming process, a spectator just as much as the audience.I find it interesting that there is a little known fact from behind the scenes: After the film wrapped, director John Huston, writer Richard Brooks, and cameraman Karl Freund all peed on the floor of the set.

At times I found its dead-serious dramatics to be almost comical in nature.There were a number of scenes when someone was being threatened with a nasty remark and a loaded gun and I found myself actually chuckling away at the unintentional humor that prevailed.I also thought that Humphrey Bogart (50 at the time) looked very tired and haggard and about 10 years beyond his actual age. As well - The role of Frank McCloud that Bogart played was, pretty much, a real nothing part where the character only seemed to come to life in the story's final showdown, and that was it.All-in-all - Key Largo turned out to be nothing more than a so-so Crime/Drama.

And I presume it was effective in its day.We probably didn't notice that the actors (especially a young Bacall) are what Brando called lazy personality actors. Or that the characters and dialog are cartoonish, and not in the way we allow, but in a stagy artificial way. Or that the effect of the storm (created on a sound stage) really doesn't threaten, with shaking light fixtures and all.It is to drama in today's context what Mystery Science Theater is to science fiction. We've moved so much in what we expect that this has become self-parody.But it is illustrative of the battle that was going on at the time for the form cinema would take. It wasn't until 1941 that the matter was mostly settled. For the ten years before, all sorts of contenders were trotted out, one of them being this form: a stage play with some wild nature or scope that couldn't be conveyed on stage.Fortunately for us, it is all but dead now. So when we view this, we somehow have to appropriate a different world. Its not simpler, what's happened is that the things we simplify have moved.This is a good lesson in noir, which is the form that flowed into the hole left when the simple stage play was blown away by the storms of an evolving audience. Compare this to \"African Queen\" which has many of the same sensibilities, personalities and weaknesses. But it has fully abandoned both the reliance on theater conventions and the reliance on a stage.The emotional pull is on the US appreciation for the silent war hero who helped rid the world of large evils through merely their natural (American) goodnesses.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",

The pace was rather slow, but I was rarely bored.That acting in this movie is superb. Humphrey Bogart plays the same \"tough guy\" character he is known for, and he does it well. I truly believe that Humphrey Bogart is the \"coolest\" man who has ever lived. Edward G. Robinson stole the show as far as I'm concerned, playing perfectly the washed-out Prohibition-period gangster who is trying to get back into the game. Lionel Barrymore and Claire Trevor also deliver solid performances in their supporting roles (although I'm no sure I'd go as far to say that Claire Trevor deserved an Oscar).I loved the story in this movie. I love Al Capone-like gangster/noir stories, and the whole hostage situation was very fun and well done. It really allowed the characters to develop, especially of Humphrey Bogart's character, who at first is indifferent and tries to stay out of the gangster's way, but because he is a good man he eventually comes to the conclusion that the man must be stopped. We also see Edward G. Robinson's gangster character try to keep control and remain a \"tough guy\", but eventually start to panic and lose control of everything.There is also some good action and some memorable scenes, specifically the final showdown at sea, and another scene in which Robinson hands Bogart a gun and almost dares him to fire. The performances by Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson alone is enough to make this a great movie, let alone the excellent story, direction and supporting cast. A must see, especially for Bogie fans!8/10",

On an overnight stay, a storm hits the hotel and everyone is under the control of megalomaniac Rocco. When the storm passes, Rocco's gang make their move but they need Frank to skipper their getaway boat.The problem with this film is that it is a bit too stagey. The cast are all good, especially Claire Trevor in her role as gangster moll \"Gaye\". She has some good scenes including the sequence where she has to sing for Johnny Rocco before she can have a drink. Rocco's refusal to give her one and dismissal of her as 'rubbish' is a good climax to the scene. But, annoyingly, the scene then goes on to have Frank defy Rocco and give her a drink himself. It's moments like these where we are so predictably given Bogart as a man acting by himself that it gets annoying. We have to have scenes where Bogart spouts his \"I'm a man acting alone\" crap. Claire Trevor also has a good scene towards the end when she pleads with Rocco to take her with him, and her final words to Frank of \"Yeah, good luck\" are delivered in a way that has a resonance that seems completely lacking from anything that Lauren Bacall says.The film has a few daft moments, eg, Rocco's fear of the storm, the story drags in parts and the ending is a bit cheesy but overall it's OK.",

            "content": "Set in the Key Largo Island, Key Largo places itself above its contemporaries as one of the definitive crime/gangster movies of the 1940's due to a superb cast, an excellent story, an unnerving setting and tense camera-work. John Huston holds the film together, allowing the characters, settings, and atmosphere to thrive on the screen.Johnny Rocco, played by Edward G. Robinson, remains one the most memorable gangsters to grace the screen, threatening but mortal. He knows there is such a thing as a fatal mistake, as he panics when a hurricane hits the resort, nearly ruining his deal with American associates. Yet even when the hurricane is hitting the resort, Rocco remains domineering and frightening, forcing his hostages to keep quiet when a sheriff visits with the threat of death, and even kills one that tries to escape. On the other side of the coin, Humphrey Bogart plays Frank McCloud, a World War II veteran and one of the hostages captured by Rocco. Unlike most heroic hostages in other movies, McCloud not only knows he's at a serious disadvantage, he subjects himself to that disadvantage and doesn't fight back, but waits. And waits. And waits until the end. In one of the movies tensest scenes, Rocco offers McCloud the chance to kill him. McCloud declines the chance, knowing he would be shot by Rocco's henchmen soon after. One of the other hostages takes the chance, and is promptly shot by Rocco. Rocco quickly reveals the gun he offered McCloud had no bullets, thus being a complete waste and instant death. McCloud proves himself as the standout hostage because of his common sense and his stoicism, barely flinching when Rocco threatens him.Other notable mentions in the cast include Lionel Barrymore as James Temple, the hotel owner who despises Rocco; Lauren Bacall as Nora Temple, the widow of a veteran whom McCloud knew; and Claire Trevor ended up winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal as Gaye Dawn, a drunken singer and the moll of Rocco.The ending to Key Largo seals the movie's reputation, finally allowing McCloud to take his revenge on Rocco and his henchmen, thus giving him his freedom. The ending shootout remains one of film's more memorable, handled with care yet as tense and surprising as the scenes inside the hotel. With its superb cast and tense atmosphere, Key Largo remains one of the definitive gangster films of the 1940's.",

Those talents, alone, would make \"Key Largo\" a very watchable film, but throw in the elements of a storm that is raging around them, and an Oscar-winning role for Claire Trevor, and the viewer has a superb film in front of him/her.Bogart plays an ex-army major who comes to the area of Key Largo to visit the family of a deceased soldier who was in his unit during the war. Barrymore plays the father of said GI, and Bacall his widow. They are glad to see Bogart and make no bones about having him stay over. However, in the hotel run by Barrymore, there are some gangsters posing as guests who are basically holding everybody as prisoner until they make a criminal deal, and leave the area. Heading the gang is Edward G. Robinson, who as Johnny Rocco, was a big-time hood once, and who aspires to climb that pinnacle of success again. The storm rages outside, and the criminals hold everybody captive inside. Compounding the problems to be endured is the fact that the local sheriff and his deputy are looking for two escaped Indians whom they suspect have come to the hotel, because Barrymore has always been a friend and benevolent benefactor to them. All the emotions that can be brought up come to a head in a small boat at sea after the storm comes to an end.Directed by John Huston, who always seemed to be a good director for Bogart, this film rates very high on Film-noir lists.

This is one helluva CAPTIVE cast of assorted characters indeed. The theme is simple enough; good versus evil, with Bogey the sympathetic hero on a mission to bring closure to a fallen hero's family. Edward G. Robinson, in what may be his finest hour, portrays the virtual last gangster of the gangster era whose biggest enemy is a lethal hurricane that, ironically, is holding him hostage. This, unfortunately, was the last of the Bogart/Bacall movies, however it may be the best of the lot as it is just plain mesmerizing, drawing you to some fascinating character studies, if not a lesson on human nature at its worst. Claire Trevor won an Oscar as Robinson's \"retiring\" alcoholic gal pal, probably as tired of him as he is of her. Thomas Gomez, likewise, turns in a super performance as another of Robinson's hanger ons, only more philosophical, if not talky. Lionel Barrymore displays his tremendous acting ability as the atypical old man, not willing to take.. (blank)... from anybody. Special nod to veteran Monte Blue as the earnest sheriff who also walks in to this Twilight Zone-ish drama. It's all here and more in a dynamic screenplay that actually may have helped build the future of Key Largo, Florida itself. Absolutely NO excuses. NOT TO BE MISSED. THIS IS IT.",

I also didn't find their characters very compelling, either.John Huston was in the director's chair and he did a fine job. The film looks polished, if not particularly remarkable.

And one of them brought his dame with him.For the purposes of the film, that would be Edward G. Robinson's Johnny Rocco character, a semi-retired mobster who moves into a hotel in Key Largo off-season to make a big score, taking with him a few of his boys and an old flame, Gaye Dawn (Claire Trevor).Humphrey Bogart's Frank McCloud is a former Army major who fought in Italy, and comes to pay his respects to the father (Lionel Barrymore) and widow (Lauren Bacall) of a fallen comrade, who run the same hotel. He's not a gangster this time, but he's still a tough guy, as Rocco and his bulls find out when they try and take McCloud for a ride.\"Key Largo\" is a brilliantly acted, moody and suspenseful film worthy of the talents of all concerned, including director/co- screenwriter John Huston. It's got a distinct Hemingway vibe about it, kind of \"Soldier's Home\" meets \"The Killers\" with McCloud a sort of Nick Adams figure. He hardly says very much, but he makes you pay attention when he does speak. (Bogart and Bacall earlier made a movie based on a Hemingway novel that didn't seem much like Papa at all!)Trevor won the film's lone Oscar, and deserved it, but Robinson steals the picture. As mark.waltz points out in his July 2012 review here, the name seems a callback to the crime-boss character Rico that Robinson played in \"Little Caesar,\" and he's still the same trigger-happy dumbbell here that he was then. He exudes menace and cruelty, and also a sense of bewildered helplessness at his present condition that's rather affecting:\"After living in the USA for more than 30 years, they called me an undesirable alien. Me, Johnny Rocco. Like I was a dirty Red or sumthin!\"The gang around him is great, too, hard-boiled stereotypes but quite well acted. I particularly enjoyed Thomas Gomez as Curly, Rocco's number-two. He chews a mean wad of gum and has a hilarious monologue while trying to distract an angry Rocco about people bringing back Prohibition so the gangsters can have the old days back.What I don't like so much about the film is the odd subtext, which plays up McCloud's current disillusionment on account of Rocco being present. Did he really think World War II was the war to end gangsterism?There's also a subplot about some local Seminoles who huddle around the hotel when the hurricane strikes. You kind of need them late in the film for the tragedy that triggers McCloud's late burst of action, but it doesn't make any sense on its own. It feels tacked on and a bit stagey, like much else in this film.And what's with the anger directed at McCloud for not plugging Rocco? Did that scene ever make sense as a display of apparent cowardice on McCloud's part? What was he supposed to do?Max Steiner's overbearing score is another letdown. I didn't even think much of the final confrontation between McCloud and Rocco's gang. It's a bit too easy and low-key.But what's good about \"Key Largo\" outweighs what's not. Bacall does fine work playing a part rather than burnishing her star power, and Bogart shows how to let another screen legend (Robinson) rant on and on without losing his own magnetism. And did anyone make a shave seem as hilarious and terrifying as Edward G.?",

It looked so great and interesting that I just had to get and own a copy of it, which I did later, afterward, eventually. I believe I've heard of both Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson, but I've never really seen nor followed a Bogart and/or Robinson flick until viewing this earlier this year. Glad I caught it and saw just what I've been missing all this time, as long as I had been doing so. Lately, I've been getting into watching some movies from the first half of the 20th century, they're all really good. And this one is no different. Clearly I made a great choice, especially considering the many good reviews it's gotten on here. Haven't checked to see if whether or not it's mentioned in the list of genres under which this feature falls, but just in case it isn't, it also has suspense.Frank McCloud (Bogart) heads to the Floridian Keys (particularly Largo) for a getaway and settles in a hotel. There, he visits the Temples, the owner James (Lionel Barrymore) and his daughter Nora (Lauren Bacall). But they are interrupted by the sudden intrusion of Johnny Rocco (Robinson) and his henchmen, all of whom take the guests and staff hostage. Things go from bad to worse when a hurricane approaches and hits Largo. Will the protagonists find a way to work their plan of rebellion and escape against Johnny? I fell in love with this film the moment I first discovered it. The only complaint I have with it is that I wish the DVD had at least a couple of bonus features (audio commentary and a colorized version as an option, which would've been nice also, not just on the DVD menu). Not that I really have anything against black and white movies, by the way, I came to appreciate them too. In fact, this is among the many films I wish I'd check out sooner and others I would've and should've waited to air on t.v., and skip renting/buying certain movies if I had, now that I look back on it. For all those who haven't seen it, try it on for size. I'm glad I came around to seeing it at last. Among the best of what at the time probably was still considered to be Hollywood's golden era.",

When he gets there, the hotel they run is being inhabited by city men of the shady kind. He gets a drink from a woman at the bar, and then goes out to meet the family. At the same time, the hotel receives a storm warning, a hurricane is on the way. They shut up the hotel, and then it is revealed that the shady men are working for Johnny Rocco.Rocco was a Prohibition era gangster, and he is in Key Largo to collect a payment. As the hurricane comes and the characters are all trapped under the same roof, danger ensues.If Hollywood was good for one thing in the 1940s, it was making films like this. This kind of adventure film speaks to the masses, while still managing to entertain. This was the kind of action film you got back then, except less action and more buildup and talking. This is the kind of film they don't make anymore, and the kind I wish they did. A film like this doesn't need a good director, or a good plot, just good actors and great dialog. This film has all of the above.The acting is consistently excellent. Humphrey Bogart plays his typical stoic hero, but that's okay because the part never gets old. Lauren Bacall does good work as the widow of Bogart's old army buddy, but her part is the most clich\u00e9d and uninteresting. Still, she holds her own against the rest of the cast. Lionel Barrymore is also quite good, a contrast to his despicable character in It's A Wonderful Life the year before.However the two standouts among the cast are Edward G. Robinson and Claire Trevor. Robinson gives a performance that acts like a swansong to the gangster characters he cut his teeth on in the 1930s. He is crass, rude and evil, yet he has a bit of heart. You don't cheer for him, but you do feel sorry for him. However the pity you feel towards Robinson is nothing compared to that of which you feel towards Claire Trevor.While Trevor mainly stays in the background for the film, she does come out in one terrific scene that definitely justifies her Oscar win. In the scene, she sings one of her old songs so that Robinson will give her a drink. Trevor makes the best of the scene and her rendition is pitiful. Robinson won't give her the drink, but Bogart gives it to her anyways. It's one of the film's best scenes.While the performances are quite good, they wouldn't work if it were not for the great dialog by Huston and Richard Brooks. While not endlessly quotable like Casablanca, their writing does give the story it's edge, and it works perfectly, although there is one line that comes out of nowhere that doesn't quite fit. The last scene, borrowed from To Have and Have Not, is a thrilling end to the story, and although it may be called cheesy by some, I believe that it was the perfect way to end such a film.The cinematography is rather simple, but for a stage bound film like this, it is perfectly adequate. The score is unmemorable, or maybe there was no score. If there was it was too boring to remember. The hurricane scenes are surprisingly well done, and the sets are well built and convinces. For a studio production, it sure tries hard to make it look realistic.Now to Huston's direction. While this story really carries no directorial trademark, it is still very well done and thrilling. Huston keeps an iron grip over the story, and though his direction is lax, it still accomplishes what it needs to.Overall, I found this film to be a nifty little thriller. It is very entertaining and still contains enough to think about afterwords. Definitely one I'd watch again.Key Largo, 1948, Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Edward G.

Yes, they're used effectively as a way to build tension, but they also carry the unwelcome side-effect of making things seem staged, and therefore much easier to telegraph. There's very little spontaneity in this film, all that takes place is either conveyed in showy monologues or brooding silence. No dynamism until the end.It's nice to finally see the chap who's supposed to be the hero conquer his demons and stand up for the people he loves, however I felt it all came a little too late to properly endear me to a character who spent most of the film either obscured or overshadowed.I have to consider this as a waste of one of the greatest couples The Golden Age ever gave us.",

Director Huston receives a credible performance where Bogart uses brains over brawn. Huston previously directed Bogart in The Maltese Falcon. Bacall is limited as a hinted damsel whose gushing scene in the conclusion gives happy endings a bad name.

Claire Trevor steals moments as his drunken lounge singer whom he mistreats. Lionel Barrymore plays Bacall's father who own the hotel. He didn't plan on a second disaster though.

It boils down to an exciting climax shootout between Robinson and Bogart.Thomas Gomez has a very underrated performance as Curly, and there is not a simple weak link in the cast. Key Largo is an excellent film that simply isn't held in the high regard it deserves. This film is more then a must for fans of Barrymore, BaCall, Bogart, or Robinson.",

            "content": "John Huston directs an adaptation of a stage play but never really opens it up. It is essentially a home invasion thriller not too dissimilar to The Desperate Hours.Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) is a drifter who arrives at a hotel in Key Largo during hurricane season to visit the family of an army buddy, George Temple killed in Italy. George's father, James Temple (Lionel Barrymore) is in a wheelchair and pleased to see Frank who he sees as a war hero. His widow Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall) manages the hotel with her father in law. The police in the area are looking for two native Indian prisoners who have escaped, while other native Indians are coming inland to escape the worse of the weather.Frank senses that a few of the characters hanging around the hotel are shady and they are hostile to Frank apart from a woman called Gaye (Claire Trevor) who is fond of a drink. It turns out that holed out in the hotel is gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G Robinson) who was deported from America but has returned. His cronies hold them all hostage as he is working on a deal with other gangsters regarding some counterfeit money.Frank recognises for Rocco of who he is. Despite Rocco telling everyone that they will be unharmed as long as they do what he says and he will leave the hotel once his business has concluded. James and Nora antagonise him which leads Rocco to show his menacing side.It really is a question of if and when Frank would be able to stand up to Rocco and his men. He had one opportunity but spurned it leading people to think he is a coward but Frank might be biding his time for the right moment.Robinson delivers a malevolent performance, Bogart gives the impression he only cares about his own self preservation but the audience senses otherwise. It is a tense film but it gets grating to see the Temples constantly putting themselves in danger by insulting Rocco and his men when they are in no position to defend themselves.",

Its two main stars take a bit of a backseat than before as this is more of an ensemble piece. To me, Edward G. Robinson really stood out in his role as a has-been gangster looking to make a comeback. Beyond that, everything was impeccable on a technical level, and Max Steiner's score contributed a lot to the atmosphere of foreboding. I've also lived through multiple Florida hurricane seasons and believe me, they're no joke. There also seemed to be an underpinning of sociopolitical commentary, but I can always suss that out when I watch it again. Overall, this put a nice bow on one of cinema's great partnerships.",

            "content": "I was overwhelmed when I read the cast and crew for this movie. Another Bogart/Bacall-Bogart/Huston collaboration is alright, but featuring Edward G. Robinson, Lionel Barrymore and Claire Trevor also? My expectations were sky-high. And that's the main reason I was a little upset with this picture. My problem was with the story. Although the movie has a good plot, it isn't well-told, and some of things felt out of place. Richard Brooks did a much better job adapting the script of \"In Cold Blood\" and \"Elmer Gantry\". I think that's mainly because those are based on novels, and this one is based on a play.The story is about a WWII veteran (Humphrey Bogart) that goes to the island of Key Largo in Florida to talk with the wife (Lauren Bacall) and father (Lionel Barrymore) of his old-friend from the war. That's when a gangster (Edward G. Robinson) takes control of the place and turns everyone into his hostages. At first, I didn't really get what was that gangster doing in that place, but it's latter explained that he's waiting for a hurricane and needs protection. But why that tiny island? I still don't get this, but alright. This flaw is compensated by one of the best climax I've ever seen in a movie. I'm not gonna spoil it here, but it's great.About the acting, Bogart did much better jobs in other pictures. This is the final movie with him and Lauren Bacall together, but I prefer their first collaboration in \"To Have and Have Not\". Edward G. Robinson also gives a great performance, but again, he was better in other movies like \"Little Ceaser\". In my opinion, the members of the cast that gives the best performances are Lionel Barrymore and Oscar- winning interpretation by Claire Trevor. They are both excellent.John Huston, as always, does a nice direction, but I prefer much better his masterpiece of the same year \"The Treasure of Sierra Madre\". That's where Huston proves the great director he is, and Bogart gives an outstanding performance.Overral, this movie has a fine acting, along with John Huston's direction and an excellent climax, but the bad-told screenplay takes away the good things about it.7 out of ten.",

Problems with this movie do not outweigh the sheer fun of watching it. Edward G. Robinson gives his last great performance as an old time mobster who is very much out of his element in the tropical heat. Lauren Bacall is fetching in a very demure early performance as the city girl who has found roots with her late husband's father. Humphrey Bogart is just right as the disillusioned yet courageous veteran.But oh, those Seminole Indians! It is grindingly inappropriate to paint Rocco as the last word in human evil when every five minutes a bunch of Seminole Indians are paraded as moronic, childlike victims, knowingly looked after by the good old white man who owns the hotel. It's no good, get me? It makes everything seem rotten, see? You don't have to read Howard Zinn or be a card-carrying lefty to figure out that the mugs who stole Florida from the Seminoles were a lot dirtier than Rocco. Dirtier, see? Andy Jackson was a hood, mixed up in rackets like slavery. He stole Florida so some tired old geezer could wheel around in his wheelchair making faces at mugs like Johnny Rocco, see? Old man Barrymore plays the geezer in the wheel chair, the Great White Father who loves his Seminole children. Every time he opens his mouth you just want to throw up. The movie seems to know that he is just a big phony baloney, that he has benefited from genocidal crimes far more horrible than Rocco's. But the movie keeps quiet, see? These are good Indians, just like children, get me? The other problem is that the movie makers are secretly in love with Rocco. When Bogey makes his big speech, \"the one and only Rocco\" you get the impression that EVERYONE, not just Rocco, wishes that Prohibition had never ended. The movie pretends to believe that the new, post-war world will be better, because \"there will be no room for the Johnny Roccos.\" (Or for the Seminoles either, pop? Nyaaah?) But Robinson presents Rocco with such relish, and the movie captures him in such color and power, that it seems clear that everyone, including Bogart's McCloud, is really in love with the past.",

The embarrassing waste of talent here is shameful: Bogart, Robinson, etc. ... but Lionel Barrymore!!!???The other cast were poorly chosen and / or mechanical.3. The story, aside from being a complete hack, was flat, dull, and lifeless. Nothing complex or dramatic.Yes, they tried to leverage patriotism here, but it's a waste (or just propaganda).4. Lastly, it's sad to see John Huston direct this crap. His talent is in a different sphere. He should have passed.Notice I didn't mention Bacall, and here's why: she can't act. Frankly, Bogart was like Wayne, Stewart, etc. That\nessentially found a character, Hollywood bolsters that ideology, and thus the same people pump out the same drivel.Bogart actually surprised me in \"The Caine Mutiny,\" but here (with his wife Bacall) it's back to pointlessness.To be clear, contemporary actors absolutely suck, and I mean hollow, empty bodies. There are a few exceptions:\nMeryl Streep, Christian Bale (not American), and a few others. So compared to her contemporaries, Bacall was a decent actor.Anyhow ...

Pretty good dialogues and intrusive hurricane raised the atmosphere to desiring tension.Edward G. Robinson as Johnny Rocco rightfully got the most space. Gangster in the true sense of the word. Character full of vulgarity, selfishness and deceit. Humphrey Bogart as Maj. Frank McCloud comes from the side angle. Stubborn character who must first clear with yourself and then with others. As expected, the last minutes belonged to him. Claire Trevor as Gaye Down, performed unworthy one Oscar. Honestly, I have not seen her role so. One of the biggest climax of the film is caused her singing. Trevor was not bad. Her character regardless of alcoholism has made some key strings in the story.

Frank has travelled to the Florida Keys to visit the widow of a friend from his unit played by Lauren Bacall who runs a small hotel with her wheelchair bound father-in-law played by Lionel Barrymore (Mr. Potter from It's a Wonderful Life). Unfortunately, a notorious gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), along with his men, and the prototypical gangster moll (Claire Trevor in an Oscar winning performance) have also stopped at the hotel. The final complication is a powerful hurricane which is bearing down on the area.The performances alone from Bogart, Bacall, Robinson, Trevor and Barrymore make this a film worthy of attention. The role's may be typecast with Bogart and Bacall playing recognizable roles that also find them in love, Edward G. Robinson playing a gangster and Lionel Barrymore playing the somewhat cantankerous old man but these performers are wonderful in their roles. But it is Claire Trevor as the alcoholic and abused Gaye Dawn who gives perhaps the most impressive performance in a role that could easily be expected to have been secondary. The film is directed with considerable flair by John Huston.The film is based on a play by noted playwright Maxwell Anderson but takes considerable liberties with its source material, the ending is actually taken from another Bogart and Bacall pairing \"To Have and Have Not\" which was not used in that film and was provided to Huston by that films director Howard Hawks.This film was the fourth and final pairing of Bogart and Bacall on screen and this is unfortunate because the interaction between the two which is perhaps heightened by their real life love affair is always effective.Typical of the era the film was made entirely on the Warner Brothers back lot but this certainly didn't affect the impact of the film for me.",

            "content": "An array of stars in this sub-genre of noir with a disaster premise. Since most film noir assumes that fate plays a (often decisive) role in life, a natural disaster is great device to drive that theme home. Actually, the criminal element (Edward G. Robinson's Rocco, Claire Trevor as his 'dame' Gaye, and hopefully-named underlings) usually represents the agents of fate; the hurricane in Key Largo adds another fateful dimension. Also it brings the noirish atmosphere of isolation and claustrophobia.The innocent folks are represented by the Temples--Lionel Barrymore as the father James and Lauren Bacall as his daughter-in-law Nora. Everyone else is pretty much on-the-level too; Bogart, as war buddy to the dead George Temple is a little harder to classify. Why exactly does he show up at the remote Temple family hotel? He says he wants to settle in there.Actually, there's two criminal plots. Aside from Rocco's mob trying to escape to Cuba with some counterfeit loot, there's a couple of escape prisoners on the lam from the two local cops Wade (Monte Blue) and the unfortunate Sawyer (John Rodney). First Sawyer is ambushed by Rocco's guys, then shot by Rocco in an unfair game of chicken. Given the chance, Frank is unwilling to shoot Rocco in cold blood--although he risks instant death from the underlings, plus his gun isn't loaded. Sawyer gamely gives it a shot, so to speak, but draws blanks.At the height of the storm, James is able to unnerve Rocco with tales of previous hurricanes, probably embellishing a bit with 200mph winds, derailed trains, and floating corpses,etc. Rocco's the only one to show obvious fear of the storm; his type fears anything they can't control. In an odd way, the hurricane is a positive force; bottling up the criminals, and distracting them as well.When Wade shows up after the storm abates, Rocco is able to finger the Native-American prisoners for Sawyer's death. By the time Wade figures out the whole deal, it's too late to save the prisoners. Rocco's accomplice Ziggy (Marc Lawrence) pops up, setting the end-game in motion. Fittingly, Gaye is the one to get the drop on Rocco; she's the one who knows and hates him the most.The denouement involves a sting of finely-crafted noir scenes. The boat, itself a very confined space, its the interior a maze of shadows and compartments; and topside in the fog, Frank bides his time with his concealed gun. As the long shoot-out develops and Rocco's guys start hitting the deck, Rocco starts panicking. He lamely tries to negotiate with Frank. But, solid-noir hero that he is, Frank doesn't bite, and, though wounded, manages to plug Rocco, call for help, and presumably make it back more or less in one piece.Nora and Frank's romance is implied by her opening up the curtains to the returning sunshine. key Largo doesn't miss a step: the pacing and tension are palpable, and everything's lit-up by some great performances--especially Bogart, Robinson, and Trevor. Barrymore's and Bacall's roles are more passive, but their scenes finish off what the other three don't chew up.Not to be missed; one of the best film-noirs. 10/10.",

So I would like to concentrate on another of the film's great roles........that of Gay Dawn played by the incomparable Claire Trevor.Trevor was a mainstay in films for a number of years before she got the chance at a role she could sink her teeth into.........as a result she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress and brother, did she deserve it. Her pathetic has-been alcoholic nightclub singer and paramour of Edward G. in better days is as good as it gets. When Edward G. forces her to sing \"Moanin' Low\" with the promise of a drink, it is heartbreaking. However, she may have been a bit too good looking for the part since all concerned keep referring to her great looks in earlier times. Trevor was never to top this performance but it is a lasting tribute to her acting abilities.Keep an eye out for Jay Silverheels (of Tonto fame) as one of the Osceola brothers and the beautiful Rodd Redwing as his brother (what a classic face he had).This is a film that deserves it's reputation and is in the \"do not miss it\" category.

The scene at the end when Frank walks out of the hotel with the mobsters and Nora looks fearful at his retreating form with her face half hidden by the shadows.

Robinson, Humphrey Bogart, Lionel Barrymore, Claire Trevor, and Thomas Gomez. In a much more subdued, cerebral and less charismatic role, I add Mrs. Bogart, Lauren Bacall, to that list. During my earlier viewing, I did not fully appreciate how she handled this more complex, thoughtful character.Disillusioned after World War II, Frank McCloud (Bogart), as a drifter, visits the Florida Keys hotel belonging to James Temple, the wheelchair bound father (Barrymore) of his Army buddy, George Temple, who was killed under McCloud's command during the Italian campaign. At this \"historic\" and weather beaten hotel, he not only finds a very lonely Nora Temple (Bacall), George's widow, but a bunch of nasty, despicable criminals, led by notorious gangster Johnny Rocco (Robinson). Having taken over the establishment, they hold James and Nora hostage. He also discovers Rocco's washed up, alcoholic moll (Trevor in an Oscar winning role), a couple of brothers from a local Seminole tribe on the run from the law, and the threat of a powerful hurricane on rapid approach. When the skipper of the hoodlums' boat secretly evacuates before the storm, the thugs conclude that only McCloud, an experienced seaman, has the ability to ferry them to their destination in Havana. After McCloud misses one opportunity to kill the detestable Rocco at the hotel, will he forego a second chance against enormous odds as he stands alone and outnumbered among the gang far out at sea?And what is Johnny Rocco repeatedly whispering in the ear of Nora Temple that revolts her so? We can only imagine the extent of his depravity. Mr. Barrymore, with intense loathing and contempt, describes Johnny best. \"You filth!\"In the aftermath of the war, the most significant theme, at least for me, is the film's deep exploration of the subject of courage in the face of formidable danger and intimidating odds. The superior acting, script, and Huston's superb direction make the daunting challenges that confront McCloud and his fellow captives very real to us. Another very significant theme is the sacrifice that so many Americans made for freedom and democracy during World War II including the \"freedom\" of criminals such as Johnny Rocco to thrive and to oppress innocent citizens by their disdain for the law and the rules of civilized human beings. Frank McCloud observes their blatant disregard of the rules and can't help from questioning the suffering endured by so many during the war, including the ultimate sacrifice of men such as George Temple and of those who loved him.",

And that will only inflate and inflate until its ending which is full of tension like i've rarely seen.The movie is mostly a clash between robinson and bogart, a man that's kinda discovering himself since he left the war. somehow i managed myself thinking how obviously people returning from wars are like everyone else: with their hopes and fears, and an experience that's obviously unremarkable for the good and the bad - but they might not be or not feel they were heroes. bogart was able to impersonate all of this, while robinson was perfect as his nemesis - the reflection he could do better.the movie adds elements to this highly suspenseful piece. but what matters is that there are the bad guys, he was just visiting and there's an hurricane in key largo which means the will be stuck for a bunch of hours together. this movie is also perfect on depicting its time: from the beggining to its end not 24 hours have passed - and we can totally feel that. it's frenetic and tenseful, and we really don't know how our \"heroes\" will get away with this.there's also bacall and barrymore, (he's very good on playing the elder man) plus the alcoholic gaye dawn, that gave an oscar to Claire Trevor. the acting here is good and that's important because the scenes are amost all in the same interior scenarios. this is a movie that relies on dialogue, effects and acting in order to fully function. The result of that is one of the most tense films ever where there's like an hostage situation, even though not totally. but the feeling of impotence is total. we feel that.nd then it's brilliant ending: the pace is incredible, the sound effects too, my heart started to race a bit. yes, it was that amazing. i think the movie itself has some minor flaws, like a few bunches of the dialogue, but then the ending...god. so, so good. it was as if everything made sense and the movie couldn't have ended better. This is a very intense film about the growing of a character, by giving him closure about his own ghosts in a way. definitely a must-see.",

However, upon entering the hotel where the family lives, Frank is surprised by a group of men led by a notorious gangster by the name of \"Johnny Rocco\" (Edward G. Robinson) who had been deported several years earlier and has now returned to the United States to carry out an illicit business transaction with another gangster from Miami named \"Ziggy\" (Marc Lawrence). But before Ziggy can arrive to complete the deal Frank has to somehow manage to keep himself and the family he came to visit safe from not just Johnny Rocco and his men but also a hurricane which is headed right in their direction. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an enjoyable crime-drama for the most part but it suffered to a certain extent by some overacting-especially on the part of Claire Trevor (as \"Gaye Dawn\") and Lionel Barrymore (\"James Temple\"). Even so, both Humphrey Bogart and Edward G. Robinson managed to keep things interesting and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",

            "content": "Someone listening to the misleadingly-worded 80's pop song 'Key Largo' by Bertie Higgins might be led to believe that the 1948 film of the same name tells of another classic Bogart/Bacall romance along the lines of 'To Have And Have Not.' Such is not the case. 'Key Largo,' the movie, is instead a taut, mean gangster flick set in the Florida Keys with a hurricane as backdrop. There's really no romance at all between Bogart and Bacall; she plays the widow of a man who served with Bogie's character in WW2. Both are more featured players than anything in an acting ensemble, and the film itself looks and feels like a brutal cousin of 'Petrified Forest,' released eleven years prior. No, the star here clearly is Edward G. Robinson, giving a defining blockbuster performance as Johnny Rocco, one-time top of the heap gang boss who is determined to claw his way back. As with Bogart's Duke Mantee in the earlier film, Rocco and his gang are holed up temporarily, in this case in a hotel waiting to sell a batch of counterfeit money then high-tail to Cuba in a rented boat. The owner and his daughter (Lionel Barrymore and Lauren Bacall) are held hostage, and when Frank McCloud (Bogart) stops by briefly to tell them about the soldier/husband's death, he becomes one as well. Even though Bogart's character is very different than the one in 'Petrified Forest,' it is similar in presentation; McCloud, like Mantee, is largely a brooding presence in the background, only occasionally coming forward to offer a wry comment or challenge. Nora, Bacall's character, is similarly used in key moments but is also seen more than heard. Rocco's gang is a bunch of unredeemable louts. By comparison, Rocco himself almost seems like a reasonable person. Almost. In actuality, Rocco struts around, giving orders, bullying, taunting, teasing... his girlfriend Gaye is a hopeless lush and he berates her endlessly. For the most part, McCloud must stand by and watch, despite wanting to lash out. He is biding his time until he can make his move without risking the others being killed. This is Robinson's show though, and you can't take your eyes off him. Everything people remember about this great actor is right here. There is one long close-up of him getting a shave and he talks non-stop through it, punctuating the lines with his trademark, \"yeah... yeah!\" every few seconds. Rocco isn't one-dimensional. He is alternately worried and yet oblivious to certain dangers. The hurricane, for instance. At first, the blustery gangster doesn't see what the big deal is. To him, it's just a rain storm. Later, when the hotel is literally shaking on its foundations from the wind gusts, Rocco becomes frightened and paces back and forth. Even later, he is back to being cool and in control, completely unflappable. The alcoholic girlfriend, Gaye, is played by Claire Trevor and she won an Academy Award for her performance in 'Key Largo.' She's good, but Robinson is better. In the end, McCloud agrees to take Rocco and his gang to Cuba and manages to kill them all on the way. He calls the hotel afterward and tells Nora he's coming back. Sorry, Bertie Higgins, but that's the extent of the big romance in 'Key Largo.' And Bogart never says, \"Here's looking at you, kid,\" either. Then again, I guess it's hard to write a romantic love song based on Edward G. Robinson.",

            "content": "John Huston had a special touch with the film noir: his MALTESE FALCON, coincidentally also starring Humphrey Bogart, is one of the best examples of the genre. And the team of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall is to film noir what Tracy and Hepburn was to other forms ranging from melodrama to comedy. Bogey and Bacall made only four films together, all of them noirs, and all of them unforgettable. My personal favorite is their final on screen pairing, KEY LARGO, loosely based on a play by Maxwell Anderson and set in a part of South Florida that I have always loved.Bogart is Frank McCloud, a World War II veteran who arrives at the title location in search of the family of a friend from his unit who died during the war. James Temple (Lionel Barrymore), the dead man's father, and Nora Temple (Bacall), his widow, together operate the Hotel Largo. When Frank arrives, he finds the hotel closed for the season, but nonetheless occupied by a motley collection of men whose words, looks, and actions are all a trifle suspicious; Frank picks up on the tension immediately, but cannot put a name to it yet.Soon enough the plot unfolds; the hotel and its owners have been taken hostage by a gangster and his henchmen, who are using the hotel as a rendezvous point for a shipment of counterfeit money, destination: Cuba. Complicating matters is the fact that a hurricane is approaching, something the locals know all too well but which takes the intruders by surprise and shakes their confidence.After some preliminary words between Frank and the gangster's men, he finally meets \"Dad\" Temple, who is confined to a wheelchair, and Nora. Their liking is mutual and immediate. Bogey is really at his best here; he seldom got to show his softer side, but whenever he did, the results were always marvelous.We finally meet the gangster face-to-face: one Johnny Rocco, played by Edward G Robinson in yet another one of his memorable turns on the wrong side of the law. It is a testament to the man's talent that he played gangsters so often yet somehow made each man an individual.Rocco has brought along his erstwhile paramour: a boozy former lounge singer named Gaye Dawn, played to a fare-thee-well by the great Claire Trevor, who won a much deserved Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance as a woman broken by men, alcohol, and life, but who still has a few resources of her own when she can summon them up.With this sensational cast and set-up, Huston adds one more character to the proceedings: the hurricane. It becomes a part of the story and in some places drives the actions of the characters. Most tragic is the fate of some Indians who came to the hotel seeking shelter from the storm, but whom Rocco refuses to allow Temple to let in; they spend the whole storm huddled outside the front door. Two of them are young men who escaped from jail for a minor charge; Dad Temple has persuaded them to turn themselves in, but when they are denied admission to the hotel, they get angry and run, and are tragically killed by the local sheriff.This is in some ways an atypical noir: it has a heart, and characters with real feelings, in a genre that is usually cold and dark. KEY LARGO is dark, but the goodness of the returning veteran and his friend's family is like a lantern illuminating this darkness; the contrast between them and Rocco and his gang is utterly stunning.I've always thought that if they had made more films together, Bogart and Bacall would have equaled, if not surpassed, Tracy and Hepburn; they are sensational here, as always. And the rest of the cast is right up there with them in an exciting film that keeps you on the edge of your seat until the final scene.",

What I do mind about this movie is the placement of the Bogart & Bacall characters into such an odd, ill-fitting plot structure & milieu. Here he's required to be a passive hostage for the entire movie. This just isn't where I want to see the Bogart character. Bacall is transformed from a sultry tease into a hand-wringing, passive '50s housefrau. No thanks. Instead of a plot that develops, a \"held captive by gangsters\" scenario is introduced in the early portion that renders everything inert. Rather than introducing tension via plot developments, it's a device to infuse all the proceedings with tension, but tension can't last for 90 minutes, and the gimmick makes for a film which is claustrophobic and stagey.There's more to viewer identification than liking the moral characters and disliking the criminals. The ailment that requires Lionel Barrymore to use a wheelchair is never named, so I guess he's just a lazy overeater. (He even gets out of the chair at one point.) He has an enormous belly and the costume designers chose to just move the waistline up to his armpits. It takes about a yard of extra fabric to cover his entire gut. Its repulsive and ridiculous. That alone made me resist identification with him. He looks like an absolute ass. Worst of all, he spouts tiresome, self-righteous, salt-of-the-earth, hick opinions at the drop of a hat, always half an hour after a viewer has thought the same thing and assumed the movie was smart enough not to verbalize it. Not so. I wanted to throttle him every time he opened his mouth.The tone of noir is abandoned for full-on sentiment. Dramatically this represents some rotten moment when stars thought that great acting meant a characters sub-text was expressed explicitly on their faces at every moment. What world is that? An annoying, hammy, crappy, overwrought song in the Judy Garland idiom, is coaxed out of an alcoholic gangster moll (Claire Trevor), and signals all the horrible, gratuitous songs that are coming in the 50s (i.e Que sera sera).It's just so homey & conventional.

When he arrives at their hotel - just ahead of an impending hurricane - he finds that gangsters, led by Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), have taken over the establishment. Rocco and company hold everybody at bay while waiting for the storm to blow over. McCloud would be the one character best suited to standing up to the overbearing criminal, but he's become very battle-weary, with seemingly no fight left in him.Yes, it's true that you can tell that this was derived from a stage play (by Maxwell Anderson), but writer Richard Brooks and writer / director John Huston do an excellent job of turning the material into a film. The characters are all compelling in their own way: multi-dimensional and convincing. Huston creates a lot of tension out of the set-up, with the swaggering Robinson enjoying his position of power, regularly mocking those who would dare to tell him off. It's positively creepy when he whispers to Bacall; while we don't know what he says; her reaction tells us basically all we need to know. Bogart, by contrast, is a haunted man who after his service has drifted from job to job with little enthusiasm. But when Robinson begins being particularly cruel and nasty, his nemesis finally finds some motivation to put a stop to him.The entire cast is first-rate, with Marc Lawrence, Thomas Gomez, Dan Seymour, Harry Lewis, Monte Blue, William Haade, and John Rodney filling out the rest of this talented ensemble. Jay Silverheels, the future Tonto on the 'Lone Ranger' TV series, has the small uncredited role of Tom Osceola. But it's Oscar-winning Claire Trevor who gets the juiciest supporting role, playing Roccos' pathetic and sympathetic, boozy moll.Wonderful atmosphere, music (by Max Steiner), and lighting (by the masterful Karl Freund), all help to make this one of the more potent films from this post-war period.Eight out of 10.",

He is searching for his place in the sun, and unwittingly enters into it at Key Largo.  There he is forced again to survive another dark storm, faced with vanquishing evil again before he can find the peaceful and happy life he yearns for.  He completely comes across as a weary warrior who wonders what he fought for, and if it's worth it to stick his neck out anymore instead of just taking care of number one.  In their genuine honesty and kindness, Bacall and Barrymore represent the light that he believed in defending during the war, Trevor the mistreated victim of tyranny he no doubt saw time and again.  You know Bogie is more than capable of dealing with Johnny Rocco and his goons despite his seemingly less than heroic actions early on and the suspense builds right up to the final shootout on the fishing boat.  Bacall, far from being the provocative and world-wise good/bad girl she usually plays, is effective here playing the young widow with a gentle heart.  As is Barrymore as the respected hotel owner who carries a deep wound at losing his son in war and attempts in vain to honor his memory by standing up to the villains who hold his hotel hostage.  Bogie is the only man who can do this and scene by scene they help to renew his faith in human nature enough for him to fight for what's right. A fascinating piece of ensemble melodrama.

            "content": "As one might expect from a film noir starring Humphrey Bogart, Key Largo is once again a great display of clashing morals and uses its main character as a kind of anti-hero who struggles to find those morals himself.Frank McCloud ( Humphrey Bogart ) is a WWII veteran who decided to go on visit to a hotel of the family of a friend he had in service who met his demise there. McCloud is this troubled kind of man, who struggles to see the 'Good' in life after he probably witnessed a dehumanizing experience during the war, with many of his friends presumably dying in front of him. As soon as he arrives this is further tested as he realizes gangsters have taken over the hotel who are led by Johnny Rocco ( Edward G. Robinson ). Whereas McCloud's deceased pal's father ( Lionel Barrymore ) would rather kill the gangster if he got the chance, McCloud is given the choice but refuses, stating that the world will not change with 'One Johnny Rocco more or less', and that he refuses to become a victim because of him. This makes McCloud the complex kind of anti-hero that doesn't follow typical moral codes but seeing as he went through the war, this kind of behavior is most realistic. He understands the world isn't a perfect place due to his experiences and refuses to take the fall for that fact, but near its ending his character development does indeed make him feel compelled to act and do something about Rocco, as even though he wouldn't take back the words he said when he could've shot Rocco earlier, he still feels he has to do something about him and his hoods due to his humanity still being very much intact.This is not that much of a typical Bogie film noir role, as Bogart is held a captive for most of the picture, but he still has this arrogant and self confidence you would expect from a Bogie role, and his acting brilliantly emphasizes his character. Lionel Barrymore is fantastic as the wheelchair bound father who has a enormous disdain for Johnny Rocco & his hoods. The real star has to be Edward G. Robinson however, as his performance as Rocco is excellent. His screen presence might not quite be James Cagney level, but it comes very close. Lauren Bacall is acceptable as the widow of McCloud's friend Nora & Claire Trevor is fantastic as the troubled Gaye Dawn.The true decider into creating such a classic also attributes for a large portion to the use of weather as mood changes. When McCloud arrives it is a very hot & sunny day, but after he progresses in the hotel and realizes it is being held hostage a hurricane outside turns up, which represents the 'hurricane' that is happening inside the hotel too. The hurricane also symbolizes Rocco's only fear, since he has no control over it. As McCloud says: 'You don't like it, do you Rocco, the storm? Show it your gun, why don't you? If it doesn't stop, shoot it.'. After the gangsters are gone and peace has returned to the hotel, we get a beautiful shot of Lauren Bacall opening a window which shows us that it is once again sunny outside, symbolizing that all evil has passed.The character development in McCloud is represented in the best way with him gunning down all the bad guys in the end, although this scene could have been better since it seems highly unlikely all bad guys would be dumb enough to be gunned down consecutively by one guy on a small boat, but it still provides a satisfying finale to an excellent picture.The acting is top notch, the screenplay is, as is usual in most 40s Hollywood pictures, once again fantastic. The score by Max Steiner is great & the struggling moral issues are still extremely relevant today. All this makes Key Largo an exceptional Film Noir that is a welcome addition to Hollywood's golden age.",

A somber ex-soldier (Bogart) visits a hotel run by his dead fellow soldier's wife (Bacall) and father. He gets entangled in their predicament as a bunch of gangsters have taken over the hotel and are waiting for a hurricane to pass so that they could take a boat to Cuba.Edward.G.Robinson steals the show as Johnny Rocco - the leader of the gang. He is helped by the fact that both Bogie and Bacall are playing extremely submissive roles. His use of face expressions and posture helps distract attention from his short and portly demeanor. Even the cinematographer and the writer seemed to be in love with the character. He gets many close ups and obviously the best lines.The film foregrounded the sweeping power of evil as it renders everyone helpless and impotent. The film might as well be an allegory for the plight of the common man during the great war. The ending establishes the self-destructive nature of evil.A fine rollicking score by Max Steiner sets the mood for a tense night in a hotel during a hurricane attack.Brian De Palma was obviously inspired by the shaving scene in Key Largo for the opening scene in The Untouchables. A group of people forced to spend time together in a confined space due to the forces of nature ..... The Hateful Eight? The fact that the film completely ignores the outdoors of Key Largo is a drawback. There are shots of a few monstrous waves. That's it.Best Regards, Pimpin.(7.5/10)",

The interaction between Bogie and Bacall sizzles; it's better in hindsight because we know they were in love. Claire Trevor as the \"lush\" is incredible. Each character has his/her faults: \"Did he, did he, did he really?\", is the plaint of an ageing and desperate father (Lionel Barrymore), crippled, in a wheelchair, asking the Major (Humphrey Bogart) about the death of his son in 'the Italian Campaign'. Given the dramatic introduction of Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), the wannabe Mafioso and stone killer, it can only get better. And it does. Rocco's need to humiliate all before him is, of course, always going to be overpowered by the force of nature-the hurricane. Rocco, the \"Emperor-of-Crime\" is, eventually, displaced by the notion of the laconic hero. Fortunately, Major Frank is an \"Untouchable\": waiting for the moment when he can kill ALL the badguys. He's going/riding back to his love. A rider, on a pale horse, perhaps. There is a belief that Mafioso were used and were central to the landings in Italy during the Second World War. Look it up.

            "content": "Key Largo was the fourth and last picture that Bogie and Bacall were in. In striking contrast to their first effort together, To Have or Have Not-a stilted World War II propaganda piece-Key Largo features excellent low key, restrained performances by the iconic duo. What's more, both appeared to fit in perfectly with what was essentially an ensemble piece.\nKey Largo begins with an unusual scene of a police car stopping a bus as it crosses a causeway bridge in the Florida Keys. The protagonist, Major Frank McCloud (Bogart), is on board, headed for the Hotel Largo in Key Largo, run by James Temple (Lionel Barrymore), the aging and crippled father of a soldier in his unit who was killed in combat during World War II. Also living at the hotel and helping Temple is his daughter-in-law, Nora Temple (Bacall). The bus is stopped because the police are looking for two Native Americans who recently escaped from prison. The film's scenarists deal with Native Americans as real people, long-held victims of discrimination--unlike other American films in which they are presented stereotypically.\nIt takes a while for Key Largo to really get going. It's made clear that Frank is just passing through but wanted to pay his respects to the father and widow of the soldier under his command. One is impressed by Bogart's earnest acting here as he so soulfully relates vignettes about the fallen son and husband.\nWhen Frank first arrives at the rundown hotel, he meets a motley crew purportedly staying there. This group of men are openly hostile to Frank insisting that the hotel is closed; Frank persists in attempting to meet with James Temple. Only an alcoholic woman at the bar, Gaye Dawn (Claire Trevor), is friendly to Frank (notably Trevor won Best Supporting Actress for her role as the washed up nightclub singer). The atmosphere of dread is further enhanced by an approaching hurricane with Frank and others helping to shut the storm windows.\nAfter all the exposition, we finally meet the antagonist, \"Mr. Brown\", aka former Chicago gangster Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) who's taking a bath upstairs. Known for his roles as a gangster in his younger years, Robinson as Rocco is a way more fleshed out criminal (a full-fledged psychopath), than in his previous roles. Robinson really is what makes Key Largo the excellent crime drama it is!\nRocco's sadistic nature is revealed in the way he teases Temple, who calls him \"filth,\" gets out of his wheelchair and tries to strike him, only to fall helplessly to the floor. Nora springs into action, pounds on Rocco's chest and scratches him in the face. He twists her arms behind her back and contemptuously kisses her. Later the tension gets even worse when Nora spits in Rocco's face. Frank uses psychology to defuse the situation pointing out that if he killed Nora, he would have to kill all the other witnesses there.\nThe tension in the plot increases when Rocco hands Frank a gun and challenges him to shoot him. After Frank declines, the captured Deputy Sawyer (who had been looking for the escaped Native Americans) grabs the gun and attempts to shoot Rocco, only to find there are no bullets in it. Sawyer is immediately shot dead by Rocco.\nWhile Rocco and his gang await Miami gangsters to arrive and buy counterfeit money off of them, we have the iconic scene in which Gaye, desperate for a drink, begs Rocco to give her one. He'll give her the drink only if she sings one of the songs she used to sing when she was a prominent nightclub singer. After a rather pathetic rendition of Billy Holiday's Moanin' Low, Rocco reneges on his promise to give her the drink, Frank goes over to the bar and pours one and gives it to her. In response, Rocco slaps Frank in the face. His reaction is great: he simply says \"you're welcome\" to Gaye after she had thanked him for the drink!\nEarly on Frank in typical Bogie fashion claims he doesn't want to get involved in trying to stop Rocco as it's not worth bothering with someone like that. Nora thinks of him as a coward but later apologizes after she sees him standing up for Gaye. And it's during the storm that Rocco shows his true colors, trying desperately trying to hide the fact that he's actually scared.\nPerhaps the greatest tragic moment is when the Sheriff finds Sawyer's body (which had earlier been dumped in the sea by Rocco's henchmen) outside the hotel. Rocco convinces him that the two Native American prison escapees were responsible and guns them down. Later he feels awful when he finds out that Temple and the others were being held hostage by Rocco and could not reveal how Sawyer had really meet his end. The tragedy of the Native American experience is highlighted in this scene as even in a contemporary setting, they end up experiencing the brunt of the white man's wrath and prejudice.\nIn the end Rocco and his buddies get their just desserts at the hands of a cool-headed Frank inside a small pleasure craft, while they attempt to make their way back to Cuba. The expectation is that Frank will stay indefinitely at the hotel, perhaps shacking up with Nora. Bacall notably matured tremendously since her first picture with Bogart. Both their performances contribute to the film's dark verisimilitude. Despite its stage play origins, Key Largo will draw you in until you're on the edge of your seat.",

Robinson is at his absolute best here as Johnie Rocco, introduced by big cigar while in the bathtub.Bogart as the world weary vet comes to return a medal of a dead war hero while the wind is quickly becoming a storm. He gives the medal to the hero's father Barrymoore and can't help noticing the widow who returns the notice played by Lauren Bacall. The classic story of a stoic dark stranger who comes and rescues the damsel in distress.Among those under Robinson's beck and call is a boozed up Claire Trevor whose pathetic singing of a song for a drink is one of the highlights of this tightly knit drama.Huston shows us the mistreatment of native Americans and whites as an entire community is forced to stay outdoors when the hurricane hits. Jay Silverheels is one of the two who gets shot by the sheriff though he is innocent and it is through Robinson's double dealing which makes the viewer hate him even more.Special mention of Lionel Barrymoore. Most of his career was under MGM and this is his only appearance with Bogart and Robinson.

            "content": "Though 'Key Largo (1948)' lacks a strong sense of threat, this claustrophobic classic is steeped in a decidedly noir aesthetic - its hard-boiled, matter-of-fact dialogue and harsh, black-and-white cinematography contrasting with its otherwise sunny setting. It makes a point of portraying the weather as a shifting, somewhat antagonistic force that keeps the core cast uncomfortably close together; the stifling heat, roof-ripping rain and water-tossing wind combine into a devastating, and properly palpable, hurricane that mirrors the escalating, eventually stagnating, conflict seen inside the movie's main location. The piece has a strong sense of character, each as compelling as the last; even the henchmen get their time to shine. The performances are good across the board, from Robinson's cigar-chewing gangster to Bogart's self-preserving soldier. Temple, in particular, is great in her bold, beaten-down, alcoholic role (which she actually won an Oscar for) and Barrymore brings an optimistic, earthy wisdom even in his explosions of anger. The majority of the movie relies on the ever-shifting dynamic between its limited number of core players, which is successful and compelling all the way through. The situation doesn't always seem as dire as it really is, though; the gangster and his crew aren't all that menacing and there isn't always an appropriate level of threat. You aren't really scared for the characters, even if the story is rather suspenseful. Still, it's an entertaining experience. All its tension eventually bubbles over in a boat-based finale that successfully ratchets things up to action movie levels. This climax is exciting and well-staged, a great note on which to end. The picture does show its age in regards to its Native American characters but it doesn't feel ill-intentioned, a product of its time rather than malice. The overall affair is confident, compelling and enjoyable. It isn't constantly gripping but it's a good effort nevertheless. 7/10",

            "content": "World War II has been over for a couple of years, and Maj. Frank McCloud (Humphrey Bogart) has become basically a drifter. No home address; no real home. Although it may not have been the focus of the movie, I thought the point was made that adjusting to civilian life after the war was difficult for many vetarans, and continues to be a challenge for many veterans up to the present day. I thought that there was a certain sadness to McCloud that Bogart captured quite well - an uncertainty about who he was and confusion over what his place in society was now that he's no longer in the army, no longer a Major, no longer in command. McCloud was an interesting character who intrigued me right from the start of the movie.McCloud drifts in to Key Largo, Florida - apparently planning to briefly drop in on the father and widow of a soldier (James and Nora, played by Lionel Barrymore and Lauren Bacall) who was killed under his command in the Italian campaign. They run a hotel in the Key and McCloud discovers that it's been \"rented\" by a suspicious cast of characters. Invited by James and Nora to extend his stay, he quickly discovers that the hotel is occupied by a group of mobsters headed by Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson, in a pretty cliche role for him.) The bulk of the movie is about Frank and the Temples trying to co-exist with the mobsters until they move on - something complicated by a major hurricane that strikes.The movie is driven by Bogart and Robinson. Both of them were very good in their parts. I was surprised to discover that Claire Trevor won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress for her role as Gaye - Rocco's girl. She was fine, but I honestly wouldn't have thought of her performance as Oscar-worthy. Bacall's role was somewhat limited; she was quite overshadowed by Bogie and Robinson. Generally \"Key Largo\" is an interesting enough film noir type of movie.It's quintessentially of the 1940's. People get shot and not only is there no blood - mysteriously, not even holes appear in their clothing. There was even an interesting (and somewhat progressive) reflection on the role and status of Indians and how they've been treated historically, a reflection largely pushed forward by Barrymore's character of James Temple, reflecting on his relationship with a local Seminole tribe. \"Key Largo\" was the last film Bogie and Bacall starred in together. It's a decent movie with some interesting characters and a little bit of social commentary that remains relevant to this day. (7/10)",

It turns out that MCloud is in for a rough time with both a major hurricane brewing and about the hit the Keys as well as big time gangster Johnny Rocco, Edward G. Robinson, planning to make his way back to the states, via Cuba. This after eight years in exile in Italy after Rocco was drummed out of the country as an undesirable alien.Besides wanting to go out in the Caribbean to catch fish McCloud is eager to meet the Largo Hotel's owner and his daughter in law James & Norma Temple, Lionel Barrymore & Lauren Bacall,who's son and Nora's husband, George Temple, McCloud was with when he was killed in action at Mount Casino back in 1944. At the hotel there's Rocco's gang waiting for the big man himself to finally make his grand appearance and jump start, after eight of inactivity, his criminal career. Rocco is planning to ship a load of counterfeit money ,\"round robin\", from Key Largo to Havana and then back to the USA with his gangster friend Ziggy, Marc Lawrence,bank rolling the deal.With everything planned to perfection by Rocco and his hoods things get a bit strained when the hurricane hits the Keys and then blows, or was it that the skipper chickened out and took off, their getaway boat to Cuba out to sea. With just a few hours left to get out of the state, as well as country, before the cops and feds get wind of what's going on at the Largo Hotel Rocco has McCloud take him and his boys on his fishing boat to Cuba planning to knock him off before they makes port. McCloud who's on to Rocco and what he plans for him turns the tables on the arrogant hoodlum by getting his men, lead by Richard Curly Huff (Thomas Gomez), to drop their guard. After offing all three of Rocco's hoods, Curly Angel & Toots, McCloud then has a showdown on the high seas with Rocco who has to do something that he's not at all that used to; whack someone, who's both armed and dangerous, by himself without his hoods there to protect him.Even though he didn't show up on the screen until almost an half hour into the movie Edward G. Robinson is by far more effective as the deported Mafia Chieftain Johnny Rocco then his co-star the, for once in a gangster movie, All-Amerca good guy Humphrey Bogart as \"Soldier\" McCloud. There's also in \"Key Largo\" the woozy girlfriend of Johnny Rocco ex-showgirl and singer Gaye Dawn, Claire Trevor, whom he mercilessly and sadistically tortures by keeping her away from the hotel's bar and liquor cabinet. The movie takes place within the space of a 24 hour period with the real star in it the hurricane that hits the Keys and prevents Rocco and his hoods from making good their getaway. The Rocco Mob plans to reestablishing a newer and better, as well as more effective, mob that will uses it's both power and influence to have probation again enacted and put on the books. With probation back in business it will put the mob back in the money by it pushing cheap cut and and water down booze to the, by then , bone dry American public and make millions, like in the 1920's and 1930's, off it. What happened instead is that after the war it was drugs like heroin and cocaine that took the place of bootleg booze which was not only deadlier but far more profitable for the mob. Rocco in a way did get it right with his idea of using Cuba as a hub for his criminal operations in the states. In just four more years, in 1952, Sgt. Batista took over the country as Cuba's dictator and worked together with the Mob, or Mafia, as his partners in establishing Cuba as the only country that let it run it's illegal operations up front and in public with him and his boys getting a piece of the action. It's just too bad that in the end that great seer and visionary Johnny Rocco never lived to see that great event in Mafia history ever happen.",

            "content": "Key Largo would be the perfect film for someone who had never seen or heardof either Humphrey Bogart or Edward G. Robinson to get a primer lesson on the charisma and screen presence of both of these great screen legends.The premise of the film is as follows: Bogart's character, Frank McCloud, is an ex-GI returning from World War II . McCloud is anxious to meet the wife andfather of his fallen soldier friend. This leads McCloud to a hotel in the Florida Keys run by the widow, Nora Temple (Lauren Bacall) and her father-in-lawJames Temple (the always excellent Lionel Barrymore, perhaps most familiar to moviegoers as the evil Mr. Potter in Frank Capra's 'It's A Wonderful Life').Things seem slightly off-kilter from the moment McCloud (Bogie) walks into the hotel. An alcoholic woman, loud and obnoxious, crowds the hotel bar and ishandled roughly by a couple of strange men who apparently are guests at thesame hotel. McCloud takes this all in but remains distant from all of thesecharacters. McCloud meets the invalid owner Mr. Temple (Barrymore) and hisdaughter-in-law Nora Temple (Bacall). There is some immediate chemistrybetween McCloud and the widow Temple.Unbeknowst to both the Temples and McCloud two huge problems are loomingin their immediate futures shortly after their initial meeting. First, a hurricane of tremendous force is poised to strike the Keys and their hotel in a matter of hours. Secondly, and what drives the plot of this film, a supposedly deported big-time gangster, Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) is the guest who makes hisidentity and motives known shortly before the hurricane arrives.The previously mentioned alcoholic woman at the bar is Gaye Dawn (ClaireTrevor), Rocco's girlfriend. An ex-nightclub singer whom time has not been kind to, Miss Dawn sacrifices her dignity at even the slightest opportunity to get a drink.The strange men at the bar turn out to be Rocco's henchmen.McCloud (Bogart) knows who Rocco (Robinson) is, and while he won't directlychallenge the gangster, McCloud takes no small delight in playing mind gameson Rocco. The scenes in the hotel between all of these diverse characters really are the highlight of this film. Even though Rocco and his gang are holding McCloud and the Temples hostage you get the definite impression that McCloud has theupper hand psychologically and that things will eventually go bad for Rocco.Bogart is fantastic. His nuanced portrayal of a basically decent non-committal drifter fits hand in glove with Bogart's reluctant hero screen persona. This is Edward G. Robinson's movie though. His performance as ruthless but paranoidmobster Johnny Rocco is one of, if not his very best screen role. Claire Trevor is great as tragic moll Gaye Dawn. Trevor won an Oscar for Best SupportingActress for her acting in this film. Lauren Bacall is good but really doesn't have to do much heavy lifting, acting wise in this film. Lionel Barrymore is great, a crusty old curmudgeon with a huge heart for those he cares for.This is a great movie and a wonderful opportunity to see some screen legendsat the top of their respective games.",

Bogart is reticent, but Robinson is willing to variously analyze the situation before undertaking any action. He's very patient, he looks Bogart in the eyes. Who among criminals in contemporary films is sophisticated like that? We--our society--is supposed to progress along with the progress of our technologies, but our films depict criminals like Jack Nicholson in \"The Departed\". Robinson displays humanity, he displays feelings and depth, and his demise, though desirable, is tragic. Maybe it was the period in American history following that in which many ordinary adolescents drifted into criminality through the opportunities Prohibition provided. Maybe mature, sophisticated persons with the ability to discriminate well the motives and deceptions of the Bogart character did really live, were a real development from the prohibition on the sales and distribution of liquor. Or maybe respect for individual life was more prevalent in the early days of film-making, and Robinson played a likely 1940s criminal. Respect for individual life is more prevalent when people have only each other, mostly only each other, for companionship.

The director is John Huston, who combines with some of his favorite actors; Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Lionel Barrymore and Edward G.

Here, amidst a terrible hurricane ravaging the tiny island of Key Largo, Bogart and the rest of the gang must dig down deep inside and find the courage to stand up for what is right and take down the evil mob boss, Johnny Rocco.I realize that even though this plot is so clich\u00e9 now but it wasn't sixty years ago, it still leaves me unimpressed as to the entertainment value of the movie. Sure, the acting is fine, but Bogart is so cool and under control you sit there waiting for him to blow like he does in his other great roles. Lauren Bacall doesn't do much and neither does Barrymore, who are both terrific character actors. Edward G. Robinson gives the best performance but even he is not truly frightening or intimidating. Nothing really incredible happens here, the story just moves along at a steady pace and we are to enjoy the actors reciting their mediocre dialogue.

The naming of storms has a unique history. Early on, storms were named for the location they hit or the particular day they made landfall, i.e. the Labor Day Hurricane. In 1953, the Department of Defense started the naming of hurricanes by a numeric naming, i.e. Able, Baker, Charlie, etc. After three years, this was abandoned and alphabetical naming of storms using female names was implemented.

            "content": "John Huston was a busy director in 1948. Not only did he release one of the finest adventure films ever made in 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,' but he also produced 'Key Largo,' a smaller-scale film perhaps, but a very good crime thriller. Both, of course, starred his long-time collaborator Humphrey Bogart, a man who needs no introduction. The film was based (very loosely, I hear) on Maxwell Anderson's 1939 play of the same name, and concerns a returned war veteran who finds himself a hostage when a hotel on the island of Key Largo, in the Florida Keys, is temporarily taken over by an infamous gangster and his men. In this film, Bogart plays his typical, grizzled hero, albeit a somewhat flawed one. Frank McCloud is no coward, but he doesn't believe in the practicality of a \"noble death.\" First and foremost, he is always looking out for his own wellbeing; McCloud seems to wish for the courage of his deceased war comrade, but perhaps it's already there and he just can't see it.Though Bogart in pretty good in 'Key Largo,' he is definitively overshadowed by the film's prime villain, Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), the notorious fugitive gangster who's making one final bid to enter the United States and recapture his former glory. Though short and plump in stature, Robinson is wonderfully chilling as the deranged, sadistic and unpredictable Rocco. There is an ever-present anxiety about his character; he is an aging, decaying mob boss clutching so desperately at his final straws of authority that he is liable to do anything. As the powerful tropical storm descends upon the island, we get to watch Rocco's nerve slowly unwinding, his greatest fear stemming from his inability - for the first time in his professional life - to control the forces around him. His predicament is succinctly summarised by Bogart's hateful taunt, \"You don't like it, do you Rocco, the storm? Show it your gun, why don't you? If it doesn't stop, shoot it.\" Rocco is surrounded by an assortment of slippery sidekicks, and my favourite was the guy who started sniggering maniacally at the most inappropriate moments (the actor's name escapes me at this moment, I'm afraid).I didn't really think much of Lauren Bacall. Whilst she certainly wasn't bad, I felt that any average actress from that era could have replaced her without any major consequences. The chemistry between Bacall and Bogart also struck me as being rather weak (imagine my surprise to later discover that, not only did the two enjoy a fruitful cinematic partnership, but they were also married at the time!). Conversely, Claire Trevor won the film's only Oscar as Gaye Dawn, Rocco's washed-up former girlfriend, who, after years of mistreatment, is finally given an opportunity for redemption. There is really something pitiful about her character, and Rocco sadistically toys with her deficiencies, demanding that she sing for a drink, only to reject her tortured and heartless performance. Lionel Barrymore, playing from his wheelchair as was the norm after 1938, also plays his character with strength and passion.John Huston is excellent at creating suspense, and 'Key Largo' is no exception. Much of the film takes place in the one house, with the powerful hurricane battering outside, creating a feeling of isolation and imminent danger. The climax with Bogart and the gangsters on the boat, a thick mist surrounding them on all sides, also proved extremely effective, at least until the obligatory happy ending. I probably would have preferred it if Bogart had lost his life in his successful bid to rid the world of one more Johnny Rocco. Then again, we can't have the audience going home depressed, can we?",

In my opinion it is the best one, although the role of Lauren Bacall is relatively small (the Bogart - Bacall chemistry is tangible nonetheless). The main attraction of this movie is the duel between Humphrey Bogart and gangster boss Edward G. Robinson.Apart from the star actors Bogart - Bacall - Robinson it is in particular the strong performance of the support actors (if we may describe them as such) that determines the quality of this film. Lionel Barrymore is very convincing as the wheelchair bound hotel owner and Claire Travor even more so as the alcoholic former singer now gangster sweetheart.Claire Trevor even won an Oscar for her role. Her most disturbing scene is where Robinson makes her sing a song (although she is not a singer anymore) in return for a drink (she badly needs one). The insecure, fragile and fearful way in which she sings that song would later be repeated by Christiane Kubrick in \"Paths of glory\" (1957, Stanley Kubrick) as she sings for a tavern full of (drunken) French soldiers in World War One.The film (which was adapted from a play by Maxwell Anderson) is situated nearly in its entirety inside Hotel Largo at the island of Key Largo. The hotel is occupied by the gang of Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson) and the owner (Lionel Barrymore), his daughter in law (Lauren Bacall) and the only guest (Humphrey Bogart) are held as hostages. The hotel is shut off from the outside world by a hurricane. A storm as an insulating device was also used in \"The old dark house\" (1932, James Whale), but in \"Key Largo\" the presence of the storm is much more explicit. We see the preparations in anticipation of the hurricane, and we see the lamp dangling on the ceiling when the hurricane has arrived.Despite the hurricane the sheriff somehow reaches the hotel to ask some questions to the owner. Huston makes this one of the most tense scenes of the film. Help has finally arrived, but no one can / dare say they need help. Ultimately the sheriff goes away thinking everything is OK. Even more clever is the way in which director Huston makes a tense scene out of something ordinary as a shave. At some time Johnny Rocco wants a shave and orders one of his gang members to give him one. In the meantime he keeps on talking. Knowing the hot tempered character of Johnny, the viewer is anxious to know how this is going to end.",

Bogart and Bacall actually acting a bit instead of just playing themselves, as they usually did, also helps a bunch.The acting as a whole ranges from great (Bogart, Bacall) to good to stock. Lionel Barrymore, as Bacall's father, does his usual tired old man character- his arthritis was so bad by this point that he was confined to a wheelchair and largely overweight.Some of the actors who play gangsters are above average, others are your everyday Warner Brothers stock gangsters. Claire Trevor was pretty good, but wasn't given a lot to do with her character...yet come would argue that she was in fact given too much to do.The noir atmosphere isn't overly apparent in the beginning, but when the gangsters hold the hotel hostage, it becomes a tense atmosphere. You are leaning in your seat, wondering what will happen next, hoping that the characters get out okay but also secretly hoping for some killings and violence.Your appetite for violence will be satisfied with this one, unless you are a sick little cookie, even if the violence is implied and not seen. You feel as though you are really there, trapped in the hotel with the characters. And when the hurricane hits, the picture goes full-on noir.The set for the hotel manages to be gritty and attractive. It's a hotel you would want to stay at, but not one you would want to be held hostage in \ud83d\ude2c. Warner Brothers was better at designing more realistic sets than a studio like, oh I don't know...M-G-M?

A true example of noir, and by far the best of the Bogart-Bacall pairings. In fact, I would go so far as to say that it's the only one worthy of its IMDb rating.",

Robinson.\n\u26aa\nAll in all, the fourth collaboration between Huston and Bogart might initially encircle the viewer with its packing exposition and intriguing premise, but after that, it surprisingly blows off its steam very quickly and loses its vehemence from second to second, and even though the overall performances are fine, the inexplicably uneventful plot, the unpacking development and the lack of a distinctly intense atmosphere sadly make this film a light sighing rather than the unstoppable tempest that was implied in the beginning.\n\u26aa\nThe third entry to my #ItsAHumphreyBogartChristmas project is the film that was generally distributed together with last week's film \"The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre\", simply because, who would have guessed it, it reunited John Huston and Humphrey Bogart yet once more. This time around, they left the desert behind and went back into the gangster/noir direction, and as solid as it sounds, it surprisingly wasn't anything like what I hoped it would be, quite the contrary, it disappointed me. Huston adapted a stage play by Maxwell Anderson, and believe it or not, the premise is totally intriguing: An ex-soldier, a hotel owner and her invalid father and a group of gangsters are involuntarily trapped at a resort in the Florida Keys, where a fierce hurricane rages outside and keeps them from going out. What I was expecting, and what was in fact promised, was a packing game of chess, full of intense verbal altercations, tricks and unexpected twists. However, it was only rudimentarily something like that, because many things were severely off with this film. It hurts me to say that, but Huston did a poor job here. In the beginning, it honestly seemed like it was going in the right direction: Bogart was nonchalant as always, the characters as well as the scenario were interestingly established and it had an undeniably great exposition, but it is what happened afterwards that irritated me completely. After the storm begins to bluster, everyone reveals their true identities and it turns into a hostage situation, the thing however is, that there is no distinct development going on. It literally stays on the same moderate level, there are no highlights and no unnerving power games going on. Furthermore, the character focus is extremely off. Like, you cannot promise it to be another Bogart/Bacall masterpiece only to centre the film around the antagonist. As fine as Edward G. Robinson portrays the smudgy gangster boss Johnny Rocco, he is way too present and dominates the screen, but not even in a good way. The alleged main characters McCloud and Nora, played by Bogart and Bacall, respectively, are degraded to side characters who act in the background most of the time, and that was nothing short of outrageous to me! Yes, there were one or two moments where there was a certain tension, but as highlights, they deliver poorly. Like, I wanted claustrophobia, mind games and a certain kind of danger, portrayed by finely elaborated characters - what I got was a bunch of half-heartedly conceived, unambiguous personalities that literally bored me. Neither the dialogues nor the plot displayed anything worth being called outstanding, quite the opposite, it was generic and felt totally unfinished. There was not the iconic cleverness that most of the director's other films usually radiate, instead it was a poorly conceived, anything but thrilling gangster story with no great moments. Also, after the first half the hurricane, the story's quintessential element, is no longer a part of the events - what? Seriously, it passes right after an hour into the film, and thus it lost the bit of tension it had developed completely. The only factor of relevance ceases abruptly, and what comes then is painfully generic as well: Bogie at last fools the gangsters and, without any decent build-up, kills them one by one, in the matter of seconds. A few minutes later, the credits rolled, and it left me speechless - but not because I was amazed, but because I couldn't really comprehend how mediocre it was. A John Huston film with the legendary Humphrey Bogart, his real-life wife Lauren Bacall at his side, and even the veteran actor Lionel Barrymore in it - terrible? Almost, because there is at least one factor that keeps it from sinking completely: the acting. Aside from two scenes (namely: Toots' laugh and Nora's ridiculous attempt to hit Rocco), it displays totally fine acting, and everyone did the best they could with their shallowly written characters. In the end, it guts me unimaginably to write this: but this film simply isn't great, although it had all factors to become a masterpiece. Only shows that you can blow a production despite having all the right ingredients.",

Lionel Barrymore has to pardon the script and go through several ridiculous representations of his character, whereas Lauren's dear husband does not really have to channel any effort, since his role is already imbued with all sorts of psychological complexes. The cinematography, on the other hand, is not bad, though the quality is rather unbalanced. Huston's vision can be calm in scenes like the one in which Lauren lights up all the lamps in the lobby while her husband shuts all the windows from outside. Throughout this single take, Rocco's men never cease showering their ominous gazes onto Lauren, until her husband enters the lobby and breaks the silence. This shot is the one of the few saving graces of this catastrophy. The real catastrophe is caused by the horrible intrusion of unnecessary music, that accomplishes in making the scenes look more cheesy than they are supposed to be, as if the laudable absurdity is not enough to shatter the audience's appetite.Despite the heartfelt advice from the late film critic Andrew Sarris, I still rented this movie out of my unrestrained infatuation with young Lauren. Furthermore, I was curious to discover why John Huston's career has been so severely undermined in Sarris' review. He is the man who made The African Queen, and I remember liking it. This has been an unpleasant yet worthwhile experience, because I know that I do not have to waste any more time on any other Huston film.",

            "content": "What an awesome film! I just feel so lucky to have seen this little piece of movie history. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall were the greatest couple ever, and throughout their career they made 4 movies with each other: To Have And Have not, The Big Sleep, Dark Passage and Key Largo. Personally I have only seen The Big Sleep and Key Largo, and if I have to choose a favorite then it would probably be The Big Sleep, because it has more Noir, which I like, but Key Largo is a great film too! The story is basically that an ex-soldier or something comes to visit the family of a passed away soldier friend in Florida. The widower and the soldier starts having feelings for each other, but then they find out that a gangster sort type boss has taken over the hotel the family owns and that with the help of his \"men\" they take the family hostage. And all in the middle of this, a horrible storm comes along, causing panic and fear in the sizzling Florida Keys!! The tension and the drama in this film is really something special... It's real! I would recommend this fourtys classic to anyone, knowing that other people will love it as much as I did. So take a little time and go see Key Largo. You won't regret it! I think...",

            "content": "There are many bad people out there, the ones who know no remorse, no pity, no compassion and no honor. They think about themselves as kings of the world, that everything they do will go unpunished - the only fear they got is to lose control of the situation. There will always be such people. But there will also be another kind - those who stand up for themselves and for the people around them, the ones who have a fear too but not the fear of losing control but of losing themselves.\"Key Largo\" is a wonderful piece of art, directed by John Huston and starring such big names in the game as Humphrey Bogart, Edward G. Robinson, Lauren Bacall and the great Lionel Barrymore. Personally I never fancied either Bogart or Robinson and thought of them as way too overrated for its time and any other time for that matter; I guess the problem that I had with watching their movies is that they were mostly typecast all the time - Humphrey always plays a lone stranger that didn't want no trouble but has to get into it, go on and solve it and Edward is always a scumbag, a gangster and authority figure who everyone is afraid of. This movie is no exception but it's their marvelous performances that really stick out and their charismas drive this masterpiece all the way through.Shot on one location this movie gives us everything we love about a great movie: masterful dialogues, perfect acting, bedazzling score that builds up the dismal atmosphere, fine camera work and the most fascinating play with lights. The protagonists and antagonists are trapped together in the hotel during the hurricane and they have to wait for it to pass through or die trying.All of the actors have really shown their finest performances here and I'd like to especially point out Edward G. - despite him being a villain you can't help but adore this man, the way he handled the role. It's not easy being bad, especially when there's so much left unsaid behind this man's eyes. The way he sees the storm and how it installs the biggest fear in him because this is the only thing he cannot have control over - simply outstanding.",

            "content": "There were a number of films made during the war years which had the same theme: a disguised form of altruism where the man who stood aloof, thought for himself, refused death, risk, imposed duty or responsibility in any form was shown being convinced by the dire nature of wartime events and brutalities that he needed to risk sacrifice, even die for others. In other words, there was a deliberate or inadvertent confusing of the morality of emergencies with those of normative circumstances, leading to demands being made on any able man to give up his liberty. One of the best of these was \"Key Largo\", also one of the best plotted and best considered of such film. The storyline in Maxwell Anderson's interesting play is classically simple. Frank comes to keep a promise, visiting James Temple and his daughter-on-law, his friend's widow.. He is unaware that Johnny Rocco and his gang have taken over the place and are holding them. When he sees how Rocco treats his alcoholic girl friend and murders two Indians, he decides he must risk his life to stop Rocco; his chance comes during a ride on a boat by means of which he is taking Rocco to escape authorities in Cuba.he succeeds and decides to stay. The theme of the film is the responsibility each man has to every other. Soi the chosen vehicle is an emergency one but interesting. As Frank, Humphrey Bogart is low-key and charismatic. Lauren Bacall as the daughter-in-law, Lionel Barrymore as Temple and Claire Trevor as Gaye, Rocco's mistress, are all very good, Trevor having the most to do and doing it brilliantly. As Rocco, Edward G. Robinson is strong and at his best whether snarling, pulling a trigger or issuing loud orders. others in the cast include effective Thomas Gomez, Monte Blue, Harry Lewis, Marc Lawrence, John Rodney, Dan Seymour, and William Haade. Credit needs to be given to John Huston and Richard brooks for turning the play into a slightly claustrophobic but well-paced and well acted movie. Perc Westmore did the makeup, Max Steiner the fine music and old pro Karl Freund the cinematography. The dialogue here is expectedly exceptional; the characters are given opportunities to reveal their true natures. And the growing closer together of Bacall and Bogart is handled as Huston usually does, through word, gesture action and reaction. This is a powerful and often moving film that bears repeated viewings well.",

In the scene where Rocco gives Bogey the gun and says \"here's your chance to rid the world of Johnny Rocco\", Bacall has a go at Bogey for being a coward. Her reaction to his statement that he doesn't care whether Rocco lives or dies and the only battles he fights are his own is shock.Is this how Bogey's character really feels or is he playing a game with the gangsters, trying to get them to think he is not a threat.For example when Old Man Temple starts to doubt himself \"no, Nora, maybe Frank's right, maybe he's right.\", you can see that Bogey is visibly upset by his reaction. As if he doesn't want Old Man Temple and Nora to believe what he is actually seeing.So who is Frank McCloud really, in this film? Is he really a cynic, or are the things he does and says during the hurricane an act for the gangsters?",

            "content": "What a cast with so much character. Hard to pick a favorite. Edward G.'s middle age gangster return is right up there with Cagney's in White Heat. Bogart's disillusionment and cynicism creates a complexity that ranks as one of my favorite roles for him. 'Why should I stick my neck out for anybody?'. Read a few negative reviews of Bacall's performance. I thought she was believable as a war widow. Amongst all the character; somebody had to be more understated. Trevor's Oscar; well-deserved; pure character. Barrymore's performance and scene trying to get out of wheelchair and praying for the hurricane to destroy the hotel; great. Dan 'I'm the electrician'is a hoodlum/punk almost as memorable as Elisha Cook's Wilmer in The Maltese Falcon (Huston seemed to have a knack for these characters). But the character that I've been noticing more after a few viewings is Thomas Gomez as the assistant to Johnny Rocco. Gum chewing and eyes relentlessly shifting and surveying the situation. Trying to put off Bogart, Bacall, Barrymore,and all with a pleasant affront with barely concealed badness. He exudes a convincing familiarity with Johnny Rocco; nervously anticipating him and trying to keep him from losing his cool. As great a supporting role as you can get I think. Also noteworthy are Marc Lawrence as Ziggy. The sheriff character is good, too. One of my all-time favorites. The only negative I've read here that I could agree with is it may be too stagy for some. With that I give it 9 out of a 10. Lastly say 'She sells sea shells by the seashore' five times.",

A few 'special' guests are in residence, including Thomas Gomez. Deflecting attention from having dealt drunk as a skunk Claire Trevor a hefty slap, he waxes lyrical- with a mouth like a workhouse oven- about his zest and zeal for deep sea fishing. No doubt talking to death any fish he's unable to land, leaving them with little chance of escape. When he fishes a gun from his pocket, it's clear that the storm clouds are not confined to the skies at Key Largo.Fat man in the bathtub, Edward G. Robinson joins his accomplices and the not-so-nice clean old man announces that the remaining occupants (disabled owner, Lionel Barrymore, his daughter, Lauren Bacall and visitor Humphrey Bogart) will be HIS guests for the next few hours. Bogart soon identifies Robinson as notorious gangster Johnny Rocco. Strange how gangsters are never encumbered with names like Horace Higginbottom!As the escalating storm begins to vent its anger and sundry items crash to the floor, there is a measured calmness within the group. Robinson being the exception. Already humiliated and raging at having been scratched and spat upon by Lauren Bacall, he starts pacing the floor. Back and forth, back and forth, drastically reducing the life expectancy of the carpet. His mounting anxiety fuelled by Barrymore's statistical recollections of the hurricane of '35. Twelve foot high waves, 200 m.p.h. winds and 800 people swept away.When the tempest subsides and Robinson collects his shipment of hot money, he receives news that his boat and skipper are nowhere in sight. With their package deal of seven nights in a luxury hotel and exclusive excursion to Cuba in tatters (It's a fair bet they didn't take out holiday insurance) Bogart is pressed into piloting the one remaining vessel at the quay. When Robinson refuses to take super-lush Claire Trevor along, mindful that once beyond the hotel, her breath is likely to stop the traffic, she uses her ensuing histrionics to steal Robinson's gun and sneakily thrust it into Bogart's hand.Embarking upon their crossing, questions remain. Will the notorious gang succeed in their escape? Armed, but outnumbered, can Bogey devise an ingenious plan to take them down? When it's all over will Thomas Gomez be in a good plaice? Either way, there are choppy waters ahead for all involved.A hugely successful adaptation of Maxwell Anderson's play, Key Largo is one of the touchstone movies of the period, intelligently cast, smartly scripted, tautly directed and well acted. Contrasting, clearly defined and sometimes complex characters, particularly Bogart with his exemplary war record, but who has had issues readjusting to civilian life.Claire Trevor took the Oscar for best supporting actress. There's a brief appearance from a youthful Jay Silverheels, before he found fame as Tonto and over two decades before he acquired his Expanding Head Band.",

Claire Trevor plays a similar role as in Stagecoach, the \"tainted\" and tragic woman. She does redeem herself by helping McCloud and the police. She did deserve her Oscar. Robinson's acting though is what makes this movie so watchable, his speech about how he made certain politicians is excellent. His portrayal as the charming face of evil is very fun to watch.

Huston was a fine director, one of the greats, but his only failing was his soundtracks. They never suited the tone or the integrity of his films. The music cues in his films are utter garbage. The 'Indian' scene in this film is typical. Great acting and direction, but the music falls back on clich\u00e9s of 'Indian' modes and rhythms which, incidentally, sound NOTHING like true Native American musical forms.Max Steiner, who accomplished the impossible with 'Gone With The Wind' in creating a score even more memorable than the film, should have known better. But he can't bear the weight of the blame. The blame falls mostly on Huston himself. While it's clear that he accords some respect to the indigenous people he presents on film -- to his credit, far more than most filmmakers of his time -- it's also clear he views them as something of at best a curiosity, and at worst a kind of cute sideshow attraction. In this film, as in 'The African Queen', he gives no context for their existence or behavior. They are strangers to our Western European tradition, and as such are accorded the same deference we might give to the first deaf or blind person we've ever met. The soundtrack in particular reflects this. Fortunately, it's mostly in the background, and we can ignore it and focus on the performances. All of which are first rate and engaging. Robinson, as usual, is a pitch-perfect son-of-a-bitch, Bogart plays the iconic reluctant hero, and Lionel Barrymore is flat out one of the finest film actors of all time, and once again he proves it without even trying.This film is so worth watching that it would be plain stupid of you to miss it.
