            "content": "The performances are terrific (with only the odd unusual line delivery, partly due to english being many of the actors' second language, and partly due to the fact that all of the main dancing characters, are not professional actors at all, but dancers - including Moira Shearer, Australia's Robert Helpmann, Leonida Massine and Ludmilla Tcherina - which fact considering, they do marvellous jobs).The story's passion for ballet and music comes across to the audience, and the story is compelling and fascinating, due to the way it is told. Moira Shearer, in a career-defining role, has a wonderful presence as the young dancer Victoria Page, who becomes a star of the Lermontov Ballet Company, and dances the lead in the ballet The Red Shoes. But Anton Walbrook is truly terrific as Lemontov. One particular moment i was very impressed with was when he begins to write a letter to Victoria, and there is a closeup of his face, and on his face we can read the emotions of his letter in a very subtle way. A marvellous scene. He has a germanic cold stare in this part which really brings it to life - the character of Lemontov is entirely in his eyes.The score is fantastic, particularly the original ballet of the red shoes itself, composed for the film by Brian Easdale. The film has such a wonderful look partly due to the fact that its production designer was a painter, Hein Heckroth.But the element which really makes this movie great is how superbly it is directed. With glorious use of colour, it is directed in a smooth, impeccable style in the manner of Renoir - except here each frame poses not as a painting, but as a moment from a ballet.A wonderful film to watch.",

            "content": "We saw this film years ago. It was a surprise when it was included as part of a Michael Powell's work at the Walter Reade recently. The film still has a great look as it seems it has been lovingly restored. Mr. Powell, working with his usual collaborator, Emeric Pressburger, created a film about the world of ballet that has proved to be, not only a timeless classic, but a crowd pleaser to those who watch it for the first time.\"The Red Shoes\" is basically a fairy tale loosely based on a Hans Christian Andersen story. Mr. Anderson and Mr. Pressburger gave it a vivid look that even today, appears fresh and glamorous. Those glorious colors in the film stays in the mind of the viewer forever.The ballets shown are magnificently staged. The Red Shoes ballet by Sir Robert Helpmann and The Shoemaker by Leonide Massine, a giant in the world of ballet. The music conducted flawlessly by Sir Thomas Beecham lingers in one's mind long after the movie is over. The glorious Technicolor cinematography by Jack Cardiff is amazing.The acting by Anton Walbrook, Marius Goring and Moira Shearer serves the story well, although the director got better performances in later films, \"Peeping Tom\" and \"Black Narcisus\", to name two. Ms. Shearer with her red hair and peaches and cream skin projects such a refined presence in the film that is hard to forget her features. The actress dressed by Jacques Fath, the famous French designer, shows why she was one of the best things that happened to the picture.\"The Red Shoes\" is one of the best films about ballet thanks to the vision of its directors.",

            "content": "`Why do you want to dance?'  Anton Walbrook asks of Moira Shearer part way through Powell and Pressburger's inventive ballet film.  `Why do you want to live?' is her cool response.  Suggested by the Hans Christian Andersen story and a project long in development by P&P, this sumptuous colour production allows Shearer to display her excellent ballet skills alongside Robert Helpmann and Leonide Massine, and all three are excellent. \nIn fact, the `Red Shoes Ballet' alone is enough to recommend this movie in the strongest terms.  Also in the cast is P&P regular Marius Goring, as the composer pushed aside for the lure of the stage.  Walbrook, as the emotionless impresario who is only alive within the confines of his art, is superb, and perhaps only his role as Theo in `Colonel Blimp' served him better.",

            "content": "The film isn't THAT closely related to Hans Christian Andersen's story; but it would be a good idea to read the story before seeing the film.  It's one of Andersen's better stories, anyway.Another minor note: if no other consideration will sway you, see `The Red Shoes' for a perceptive look the position of the ballet composer relative to that of the dancers.  For Powell and Pressburger it's no more than a diverting side issue, but it's one of the things that especially interested me.  If you look at advertisements for ballet productions today, you'll notice that the composer's name is NEVER printed - even if the ballet is called `Cinderella' and the public has no way of working out whose score is being used.  It puts the composer in his place, no doubt.  Yet musicians at the ballet are in the habit of thinking that they're the most important people there.I'm on their side.  I happen to loathe classical ballet as such.  `Swan Lake' strikes me as a lovely score disfigured by people who insist on dancing to it.  Yet `The Red Shoes' makes me put all of this aside.  Indeed, it would be fair to say that I simply CAN'T dislike ballet while watching the film - which is especially odd, considering some of the things it does to people.So, yes, if `The Red Shoes' can have this effect on ME, of all people, it's surely one of the best films ever made.  I can't agree at all with the people who describe the film as `melodrama' or `camp'.  (The latter charge I scarcely even understand.)  The story is what it is and it's told at the most realistic and sincere level appropriate.  The characters who act theatrically (NOT melodramatically) are all creatures of the theatre, and have not spent not just their days but their lives in Lermontov's troupe. If you want a more understated view of things then watch the musicians.  To put in a word for one of them, Brian Easdale's source music is superb: GOOD music of a kind that an English composer like Craster might well be expected to write.  It's clear that Easdale wrote Craster's compositions first, and then constructed the rest of the score around them, rather than vice versa.",

The Red Shoes I consider to be the ultimate dance film, and is absolutely beautiful in every sense. The cinematography is fabulous, and the choreography is dazzling. The screenplay is excellent, and as the lovers Anton Walbrook and Moira Shearer head the fantastic cast(including Marius Goring) and do an impeccable job at it. The music was just gorgeous, and this is coming from a classical music fan, very lyrical, and just exactly what a ballet score should be like. All in all, if you see the Red Shoes on television, I advise you to watch it, even if you don't like it at first. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

            "review_title": "A true masterpiece",
            "content": "A great film speaks to each of us in a different way.  To me this more than a colourful piece of escapist entertainment, this was  a glimpse into a world of magnificent color, sumptious settings, French Haute Couture, the theatre, music, luxury hotels, elegant opera houses, chaffeured Rolls Royce cars, travel to the South of France - in short, everything that a child in the near bankrupt England in 1948 had never seen and could barely imagine. \nI was fascinated not only by the glimpse of an elitist life, but of the time capsule which the film presented of a time and place that no longer exists as it was at that time.  The views of London in 1948, are similar to watching \"World War II in Color\" on the history channel.  When the ballet company travelled, they took the train.  Rationing may still have existed back then, and travellers could not take money out of the country, except for a ridiculously inadequate amount; therefore, if you went abroad you had to know someone with whom you could stay.   I also found myself wondering how they got the money to make a technicolour film in 1947, when they began filming. Part of the film takes place in Monte Carlo, only 20 years after the heyday of the famous Ballet Russe.  In fact the ballet company in the film is quite obviously based on the Diaghilev Company.  Former member Leonid Massine has a major part in the film, and Marie Rambert has a cameo role. \nThis is also a ballet film for those who do not really care for ballet.  The plot is simple - rising young ballerina falls in love with rising young composer and must choose between him and a career possessively controlled by the impressario - and acts as a frame for the ballet.   The film is as near perfection as it is possible to get, and watching it in 2004, it does not seem to have dated at all.  Everyone, especially Anton Walbrook, is perfectly cast.  The script is witty and occasionally humorous.  The technicolour photography is superb, especially capturing Moira Shearer's flaming red hair. The audio commentary on the DVD adds immensely to the enjoyment of the film, which is one that can be watched over and over.  o understand how great this film really is, try watching Baz Luhrmann's \"Moulin Rouge\" travesty afterwards.",

            "review_title": "A Duel for Art: a Hero *for* our Time",
            "content": "Art as vocation; art as religion; art as the purpose of life: The Archers team of Powell and Pressburger aimed high with 'The Red Shoes' - and scored a bull's-eye. The film is a feast for the senses: cinematography (by Archers regular Jack Cardiff), music, acting and ballet are combined to make a magnificent whole. Emeric Pressburger's story appears simple at first glance, but is a challenging study of the value and purpose of art, and of aestheticism as a creed (a term not used lightly). It is given life by some of the most talented dancers of the era: Leonid Myasin/Massine as lovable Grisha; Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina as glamorous, flighty Irina; Robert Helpmann - who choreographed the title ballet - as Ivan; Marie Rambert as herself, and Moira Shearer (Ashton's 'Cinderella') highly appealing as the heroine Vicky. The non-dancing cast is led by Archers regulars Anton Walbrook (magnificent - why no Oscar?) and Marius Goring (so convincing I ended up wanting to slap him).The plot combines Andersen's fable, 'The Red Shoes' with elements of Dyagilev's relationships with Nizhinskii and Myasin, and the effect of the younger men's marriages. Dancer Vicky Page (Shearer) and composer Julian Craster (Goring) are taken up and encouraged by ballet impresario Boris Lermontov (Walbrook). Boris is the film's dominant character, an obvious portrait of Sergei Pavlovich Dyagilev (1872-1929), one of 20C culture's greatest figures, the driving force of 'Mir Iskusstva' and the 'Ballets Russes'. However, his Scots-Russian surname alludes to Mikhail Yur'evich Lermontov (1814-41), poet and author of 'A Hero of Our Time', Pushkin's successor as the voice of Russian Romanticism. Boris is an aesthete and perfectionist, a true believer in the religion of art. All his passions and energies are channelled into bringing out the best in the company that is his 'family'. He demands equal dedication from his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. He believes that if you have an outstanding talent, your primary duty is to give that talent its fullest expression, not fritter it away through mundane distractions and dalliances. Human relationships are transitory: what matters is the art. It is a stern, unsentimental creed, but a noble one.Vicky and Julian begin an affair during the creation of the new ballet, 'The Red Shoes' (which we see in full, and has, in its sacrificial death-by-dancing, echoes of Stravinskii's 'Sacre du Printemps', choreographed by Nizhinskii for Dyagilev). Their love tests their commitment to Lermontov's ethic. What makes the conflict interesting and effective is that it is not trivialised as sexual rivalry: Boris is discreetly signalled as gay, like Dyagilev - something reinforced by the casting of Walbrook. (It is unnecessary to highlight the courage, in 1948, of placing centre-stage a dignified, powerful, non-caricatured gay character, played by a gay actor who had escaped Nazi persecution.) The struggle is between real Romanticism - hence Boris's sharing his name with the Byronic poet - and mere 'romance'. But the brutal climax, bringing together Andersen's story with suitably Russian overtones of 'Anna Karenina', is an evasion of decision: a character choosing death rather than commitment one way or the other. The final scene combines tragic lyricism with awareness of the unnecessary waste: and the dance, of course, goes on.My understanding of and relationship with 'The Red Shoes' has changed and deepened with time. In girlhood, I was inclined to be relatively indulgent to Vicky and Julian. In middle age, they seem plain self-indulgent. Julian, frankly, isn't worth any sacrifice. Ballet is a \"second-rate form of expression\", he says in a quarrel with Boris - who, of course, launched his career. (If Boris had punched *him* instead of the mirror, how I'd have cheered!) He regards Vicky as a muse for his own fulfilment as a composer, while she frets with frustration, her pointe shoes in a drawer, her own artistic fulfilment denied. Their separate beds after marriage seem a revealing insight, not merely '40s film censorship. On the spectrum of fictional obnoxiousness, Julian's not far behind Angel Clare in 'Tess of the d'Urbervilles'. Boris's manipulations are actually *less* selfish - directed towards enabling Vicky to express *her* creativity to the maximum - not bury her talent in a drawer.Yes - Boris's passionately held vocation and values now evoke my strongest sympathies and recognition/identification as a fellow 'true believer' in art (and long-time Dyagilev-ite). Young sentimentalists may hate him (he knows \"adolescent nonsense\" when he hears it!), but he speaks hard truths and much wisdom. Personal relationships are fragile; a dancer's active career can be short. If you have a gift, service to it must come first: it is a sacred duty. Domesticity can wait. Yes, he is autocratic, temperamental: prophets and visionaries usually are. And what is his job? To unite other exceptionally gifted people from diverse disciplines - painting, costume, music, dance - with *their* competing egos and artistic temperaments, to create the multifaceted art of ballet. Herding cats is easier! And yet he is capable of generosity and forgiveness, as with the prodigal Irina. A complex, moving, genuinely heroic figure, 'The Red Shoes' is more his film than Vicky and Julian's.But what went wrong with British film? The Archers made 'The Red Shoes' in 1948; now we have vacuous romantic-comedy/chick-flick pap or drab kitchen-sinkers that might as well be TV soap episodes, betokening a loss of cultural and intellectual confidence. (In visual flair, has The Archers' torch passed to Baz Luhrmann? Time will tell!) The present cultural climate treats the arts as an optional add-on to civilisation, rather than a defining part of what it means to be civilised. The arts are constantly called upon to justify their existence in commercial or social engineering terms, not for their intrinsic worth. A film, then, in which the most compelling character advocates Art for Art's Sake - art as a sacred calling - flings a gauntlet in the face of a market-driven, anti-intellectual, anti-beauty, utilitarian society. Sergei Pavlovich/Boris Lermontov, where are you now we need you?!!!",

            "content": "I first heard of \"The Red Shoes\" when I read the liner notes to an album by the jazz/fusion group Weather Report, called \"Tale Spinnin'\". Therein it said that saxophonist Wayne Shorter had seen the film a few dozen times. Intrigued, I watched it when I noticed it in the TV listings. What a discovery!With its focus on the tangle of lives of a ballerina, a composer, and a dictatorial impresario who uses them both, the story may have elements of a soap opera, but it's a superior soap opera. What appealed to Shorter, I'm sure, is the film's depiction of the artists' creative process. It may have been done better elsewhere, but I haven't seen it. Besides that, it's beautifully directed, beautifully photographed and sumptuous to look at throughout. The surreal title ballet is performed in a segment that is stunning, and I'm not just using that word as a cliche.Anton Walbrook stands out as Lermontov, leader of the ballet troupe. There are many real-life artists from the ballet world in the film, including Leonide Massine and Robert Helpmann. Massine is particularly effective.Don't be put off by the notion that this is some effete art film; it's high quality AND accessible.

The characters are quite interesting in themselves, and the story brings out some worthwhile aspects of each of their natures while giving a realistic and often fascinating look at their world.By no means do you have to be a ballet fan to appreciate and enjoy the story or the settings. While fully convincing in themselves, they are also set up so that the most important aspects and conflicts of the plot could easily be applied to those working in other creative fields as well.Moira Shearer, Anton Walbrook, and Marius Goring make a nicely balanced and intriguing trio of main characters. The opening scenes work very well in bringing them together while being enjoyable to watch in themselves. From there, the creative tensions are built up steadily as the story itself becomes even more interesting. The script makes use of the best conventions of its genre, while never allowing itself to become formulaic.There is also a good deal of creativity in many of the individual sequences. The opening scene at the opera is particularly clever in playing off of a viewer's initial expectations. The most spectacular sequence is the \"red shoes\" ballet segment itself, a very imaginative and enjoyable mini-movie that also parallels some of the main story's most interesting ideas.

            "content": "I guess the lesson to be learned is that when one is in the arts and striving to be the best it demands 100% of you. At least that's the lesson I took away from The Red Shoes. The film itself is a reworking of the plot from Maytime with dance instead of singing as the art form.Moira Shearer plays aspiring ballerina Victoria Page and her talent is immediately recognized by ballet impresario Anton Walbrook. He takes her under his wing, but Walbrook seems to want to control every aspect of her life. Walbrook also gives a break to young composer Marius Goring whom he hires to help orchestrate the music that the dancer's use. Goring is talented but also quite full of himself as well. Soon enough Shearer and Goring fall in love and that does not fit into the long range plans Walbrook has.The title comes from a story by Hans Christian Andersen about a ballerina who sees a pair of red ballet slippers and puts them on and she can dance better than anyone has before. But The Red Shoes have their own enchantment, you can't stop dancing once they're on. The ballerina arranges for her feet to be cut off to stop dancing.The ballet is an allegory for the terrible price one of these three has to pay for art's sake. The ballet itself which we see in its entirety is maybe the best ballet sequence ever brought to the big screen. Pieces of other classic ballet numbers are also scattered throughout the film and are woven and completely integrated into the plot.Though John Barrymore who was the manager and husband of Jeanette Macdonald in Maytime was no longer available, Anton Walbrook got his career role out of playing Boris Lermontov who constantly walks back and forth over the line between dedication and obsession. Marius Goring is far from Nelson Eddy in this, he's ambitious and wants it all wife and career. To the extent that Shearer is also in the arts, he wants her in no small part to support his ambitions. In fact he becomes as unlikeable as Walbrook. Torn between these two men it is no wonder Shearer meets the fate she does.Wonderful ballet sequences splendidly photographed by Jack Cardiff and well tuned acting performances by the three leads are the hallmark of The Red Shoes. This one is a timeless classic.",

            "content": "I am biased because I have loved this film ever since I was four years old. Some films, as you grow and age, lose their magic and you forget what made you love it as a child. This film has only strengthened my love and appreciation of it as I have grown older. I am not one to narrate a storyline, as this film is great for more than, and even despite, it's story.The beautiful colour photography of the locations, including London, Paris and Monte Carlo, will take you back to a fictional glamorous 1940's where everyone wore chic clothes and were perfectly mannered and groomed and make you wish you could visit there sometime.The music is a highlight for me. Brian Easdale has written such a detailed and nuanced lyrical score that does not overpower any moment in the film. There are moments where the music so perfectly conveys a character's very thought, even though they are not saying a word and their face betrays not a hint of emotion.The story is a familiar one, particularly today, of ambition and the balance between career and personal life, between a creative passion and a human one. And of course, yes there is the ballet element. I have no interest in ballet and I love the film. It does play up the prima ballerinas and haughty choreographer stereotypes, but as they are played by real ballet dancers, I think it makes it all the funnier. Robert Helpmann and Leonide Massine are particularly hilarious and over the top, so full of pathos and themselves.Anton Walbrook is the star of this film, playing a Diaghilev type character and absolutely dominates any scene he is in. He is not bombastic in a showy, hammy way. It is a more silent but deadly charismatic performance. It is a pity he did not receive an award for it. He is stern, uncompromising, cold and passionate and absolutely deadly. He is a gentleman tough guy.Moira Shearer and Marius Goring, unfortunately do not fare so well in comparison, but they are perfectly adequate in their roles and have some touching and funny moments. It is not altogether their fault, the characters are a little bland, especially in comparison to all the other larger than life characters they are paired with. Shearer really comes good as soon as she starts dancing.Which brings me to the fifteen minute ballet in the middle of the film. It is beautiful (and brief). The dancing is fabulous, it looks beautiful and the music is amazing. No one should fast forward this masterpiece of filmed ballet. It is cinematic, not (as filmed ballet usually is) procenium stage bound. It is a modern ballet, choreographed by Robert Helpmann and Leonide Massine and is a story, perhaps even a mirror, within and of the film.The Red Shoes combines every one of it's elements into a perfect whole. Some elements are a bit lacking, the story is very simple and given another context a bit soap opera like, but combined with the visuals, the music, the characters and the human comedy-tragedy, it is a beautiful complete film and one that will keep improving with age.10/10",

The \"Red Shoes\" ballet sequence is, of course, the highlight--and it's interesting to note you do not see it from the audience's point of view, but from within the dancer's imagination. This centerpiece alone puts all other ballet films to shame, and in fact makes some (like Herbert Ross's \"The Turning Point\") seem downright irrelevant. Problems with the last act may be due to the constraints of (and faithfulness to) the Hans Christian Andersen fable the plot derives from, but the finale is so over-dramatic it may provoke some giggles. The picture manages to capture happily frantic backstage life like no other movie, and is memorable and exciting for many different reasons, but when the final bows come, the story has somewhat molded over. *** from ****",

When a young composer (Craster) is also employed it sparks conflict within the creative trio.  Craster and Victoria fall in love to the detriment of their careers as Lermontov begins to realise he is not only losing Victoria but also losing the chance for her to ever dance Craster's `The Red Shoes' ballet again.With time this film appears to have become more famous and have a better reputation.  This seems to be mainly because of praise and commendations from modern directors like Scorsese and Spielberg who cite it as a reference.  But to ignore that fact that the film is worthy of praise even without such famous referees to fight it's corner.  The reason that it is worth seeing is simply the richness of the production.  While much British cinema in 1948 was black and white this film not only used full colour but is a rich vibrant colour which is combined which a lavish production and wonderful imagery.The ballet scene itself is worth watching it for and is a perfect example of what I'm talking about.  By taking it beyond the stage and into the minds of the dancers it adds layers of beauty where before we would have only had the audience in the background.  However I don't hold the same opinion as many who feel it is one of the greatest films ever made \u0096 it isn't, although I can understand how it would make such an impression in a black & white world \u0096 even now it is visually impressive.The weakness for me is the actual story.  I know that it is loosely based on the real life unresolved relationship between Diaghilev and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Nijinksy but the telling here lacks the wonder and power of the production. Instead much of it is a more mundane love-triangle melodrama that often fails to involve.  It is still gripping at times and the climax is worthy but it still can't compare to the overall production that is to the detriment of the film.The characters aren't as full as they needed to be and they don't involve as well as they should have as a result.  Walbrook is good as the driven ballet master and adds passion as well as restraint to his performance.  Goring is a little less complex and plays it a little plainer for much of the film as a result.  Shearer is wonderful when she has to dance but as an actress she doesn't always convince.  However for all my reservations they all do pretty well for the climax that could have been ridiculously overwrought but is good enough.Overall this is a wondrous film despite the slightly weak melodramatic telling of the central plot.  However the colour and richness of the film more than make up for these problems.",

Sooner Vicky becomes the lead dancer of his company and a sensation in Europe. Craster composes the ballet \"The Red Shoes\" based on the fairy tale of Hans Christian Andersen and Vicky falls in love with him. The jealous Lermontov sends Craster away and Vicky decides to leave the company and marry Craster. However, when Lermontov meets Vicky one year later, he offers the position of lead ballerina in his ballet back to her; the youth feels divided between her passion for dancing and her love for Craster, leading her to a tragedy decision.\"The Red Shoes\" is a magnificent work of art and one of the most beautiful features I have ever seen. The story of the ballerina Vicky, a woman that can not live without dancing and is pressed by her beloved husband and by the manager of the ballet company to choose between her life of wife or ballerina, is heartbreaking. Moira Shearer is very beautiful and the color of the restored DVD released by Continental Distributor is fantastic. \"The Red Shoes\" deserves the awarded Oscar of Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Color, and Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Os Sapatinhos Vermelhos\" (\"The Little Red Shoes\")",

            "content": "\"Why do you dance?\" ballet impresario Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) impassibly asks Vicki Page (Moira Shearer), another of these Covent Garden dreamers who can't fool him.\nBut Miss Vicky plays in another league, she marks a pause and retorts \"why do you want to live?\", the man who was so stingy in smiles lets one slip, he's obviously amused by that question, it's a rhetorical one but he answers nonetheless, that's how thrown off he is: \"I don't know, but I must\" That's her answer too.\nAnd that simple exchange encapsulates what Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger's classic masterpiece \"The Red Shoes\" is about: Passion.\nThe film is one of the greatest, if not the all-time best movie about ballet, it's all fitting that the title contains the word \"shoes\", but its soul rests in the word \"red\" word, red like the fire that ignites three people caught in an odd triangle of love and dedication to art. Some do arts for a living, some live for art, what when these two visions collide? What when there's a choice to make? But I'm being hasty here, let's get back to the genesis ... or how a simple screenplay meant to be a vehicle for a Hollywood star became another bull's-eye from the Archers!\nThe screenplay is actually both an original and an adapted one, like many self-referential show-within-show movies, it is based on a pre-existing work and make backstage realities and fictional shows converge toward the sameconclusion. One can make an easy comparison with Darren Arronofksy's \"Black Swan\" and Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\" as the emotional skeleton. Working on an existing work is crucial because two original stories can strike as contrived coincidences while a work with an existence of its own allows a better suspension of disbelief.And it's like Hans Christian Andersen's tale was begging for such a parallel story. The tale is about a woman who puts on some red shoes from a Demonic shoemaker and then can't stop dancing, what starts as an enchanting musical escapade with her boyfriend turns out into a nightmare, the girl dances until she wears nothing but rags and end up so exhausted she got her feet cut to stop the curse... the story is the perfect embodiment of the way passion can drive people to extremes... with a few Faustian undertones.\nPowell and Pressburger made a lavish movie about people who are all deeply dedicated to their art and can't allow anything to interfere with it, it's just as if there was a sort of a pact with the devil in a movie that doesn't seem to have any villains. Lermontov is the closest to one but it's more a posture than a nature. Played with dignified severity by Walbrook, he's the kind of man who doesn't let any emotions interfere with work and his only outburst of genuine sympathy happen to be approvals of good work. And when he hires a young pianist as an assistant conductor, it's because he can recognize talent when he sees it.\nJulian Craster (Marius Goring) doesn't have the flashiest role of the leading trio but his seemingly lack of physical appeal justifies that he would be the easiest to surrender to love while enhancing Lermontov's frustration that Vicki make a rival out of such a bland man. Lermontov' fortress of confidence is obviously shaken; he could have lost Vicki's heart for Art but not for Julian. We know from that point that tragedy is tiptoeing toward their people's lives. Lermontov himself was based on famous Ballet Russes founder who fired two dancers after they fell in love.\nBut as riveting as the story is, it doesn't tell one tenth about the film's greatness.\n\"The Red Shoes\" is a dazzling looking film served with Technicolor magnificence, restored with the sheer passion of Martin Scorsese who holds it as one of his favorites, a movie where the hair of Moira Shearer can't inspire any better description than the one written in Powell's memoirs \"an autumn bonfire\", and where the score and the cinematography render all the grace and magic of the ballet and the tragedy of great art, summed up in that meaningful statement: \"a great impression of simplicity can only be achieved by great agony of body and spirit.\"\nWhile \"Black Swan\" was an introspection into the agony and spirit of a tormented soul with the same tragic perfection at the end, \"Red Shoes\" is a more extraverted hymn to the beauty of dance and the way the music can command the most graceful fantasies, and the film couldn't have conveyed that message had it not contaminated the crew, which means the director, art-designers, the camera operators, the writer and the choreographers.\n\"The Red Shoes\" is renowned for a long ballet sequence when we can have a proper view on Moira Shearer's talent as a professional dancer. That Powell wanted a real dancer was the right approach, proving that he respected viewers, art and artists and that a debutante like Shearer or professional dancers such as Leonide Massine or Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina could be so natural is one of these miracles allowed by the Gods of the reel when you show them enough respect.\nThe dancers might have made a pact with the Devil, the Archers made one with Heaven. And as for the ballet in itself, it's a moment of pure heavenly magic that transcends the story and puts us viewers in Vicki's state of mind, it's a surreal combination of stage artifices and camera magic, an extraordinary symbiosis between reality and dreams. It's also a masterstroke of directing featuring many daring special effects we would be wowing over if we weren't so drawn by the music and the art-direction (two deserved Oscar wins for the film).\nTruffaut demanded that a film expressed \"either the joy of making cinema or the agony of making cinema\". That's exactly what \"The Red Shoes\" are about: joy and agony disguised as sheer virtuosity.",

Kubrick was cold, Bergman dour, Welles flamboyant, Godard pretentious, PP are melodramatic. They toyed with melodrama throughout their career but the great shift I appreciate in The Red Shoes is towards intelligent cinema, where melodrama is only a trope for it, a way to make that cinema. Powell's camera often gives the characters room to walk in broad shots, it creates a stage for them so that the ballet is played on two levels, it's danced and it's acted out and the story is mirrored between the two, played out in one then the other. Filmmakers as disparate as Hitchcock and Godard would go on to explore that narrative mirror, but PP were there first and that for me, not the pretty colors, is the testament of their greatness.The movie is selfaware, it's artificial, not because it doesn't know any better but because it does, because it grasps the idea that through the contrived we may begin to make something real that shapes the world. In this case the ballet shapes the story of the movie and even as it spirals deep into the soap operatic, PP's cinema does't forget it's giving a performance. In other words, there's soap here but it's truly operatic. Colors dazzle and the camera seduces, but first of all The Red Shoes demands the analytical mind to approach it bravely.In the PP canon I prefer Black Narcissus to this, for different reasons, but this is still superb stuff that needs to be seen by cineliterate people.",

As a rule I really dislike ballet. I don't get it. I am also not a particular fan of the directors Powell and Pressberger. Why would I bother seeing the film with two things going against it? because I have been told as long as I can remember that its a great film.I don't see what the fuss is about.The story of a girl who must contend with the men who love her while giving everything for her art is on the face of it compelling. However Powell and Pressberger have made a tale that is highly artificial. Yes I know its suppose to be art, but to me great art should seem natural and real, even in its artifice. Everything in the Red Shoes feels unreal and unnatural beginning with the pumped up color. Nothing in real life looks like this. Actually I felt as though I was watching a German expressionistic film but in color, and with out the connection to the heart (the fate of our heroine made me giggle).To be honest I can't argue about the film on a technical level. Its a brilliantly made film. Its as finely a constructed film as they come. However I can't see past the construction. I can't see anything else. There is no heart, no connection to the audience. There is only the artifice passing as art.I don't think this is a truly great film in the way that the best films are, I don't think it truly touches ones heart the way that it should.

            "content": "\"The Red Shoes\" is set in the world of the ballet, and is a variation on the \"A Star is Born\" theme. Victoria Page, a promising young ballerina, joins the prestigious Ballet Lermontov as the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of its autocratic impresario Boris Lermontov. Under his tutelage she becomes a major star and dances the leading role in a new ballet he has commissioned, \"The Red Shoes\", based on a story by Hans Christian Andersen about a girl who dances herself to death after putting on a pair of magic shoes. Lermontov is an obsessive man for whom ballet is virtually a religion, and the requirements he makes on his dancers (at least the female ones) are quasi-religious. He believes that great art can only be produced by those who dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to it, which means that they must give up all other attachments, including love. When Victoria falls in love with, and marries Julian, the young composer who has written the music for \"The Red Shoes\", she is forced to choose between her love for him and her place with the company.The film is more than a simple melodrama about a girl forced to choose between the demands of love and those of art. I have never been convinced by Lermontov's theory that great art can only arise out of ascetic celibacy, if only because a casual glance at history will show that most great art, in all fields of artistic endeavour, has not been produced by celibate ascetics. In some cases it has been produced by those who were very far from being so. I doubt if Powell and Pressburger were convinced by the theory either- both were, after all, married. Although Lermontov is named after a great Romantic poet, his artistic credo is the precise opposite of that of the Romantics, who believed in the primacy of emotion in art and that strong emotions, particularly love, would supply the artist with inspiration.The film works on three levels. On one it is an exploration of the world of the ballet, a subject not often dealt with in the cinema. Even I (and I am far from being a balletomane) was fascinated by the lengthy dance sequences in the central part of the film. Secondly, on the metaphorical level it is an allegory of the artist's need to make personal sacrifices in order to achieve his or her goals. (Andersen's story was clearly chosen as the subject of the fictitious ballet because its theme parallels Victoria's own life). Thirdly, and on a more personal level, it is a psychological drama based around a variation on the \"eternal triangle\" theme.Unlike some reviewers I do not believe that Lermontov is gay. (That idea probably stems from the preconception that any man who takes an interest in ballet must be homosexual). Indeed, I believe that the film makes more psychological sense if one takes the view that he is heterosexual and that he is, on a subconscious level at least , in love with Victoria (just as he was previously in love with her predecessor as his prima ballerina, Irina, who also left the company when she married). He is unable or unwilling to make any direct romantic approaches towards her- possibly he does not recognise his subconscious feelings for what they are, or possibly he prefers her as a remote, idealised figure on a pedestal than as a real-life wife or mistress. Nevertheless, he is as jealous as if she were his real wife or mistress, and knows that she cannot be his ideal woman as the wife of another man. His \"art versus love\" theory can be seen as the sublimation of his own desires for her. It is notable that he does not take the same interest in the love-lives of any of his male stars, and although he admires Julian's work as a musician and is reluctant to lose his services, his relations with Julian do not have the emotional force of those with Victoria.Julian has little understanding of his wife's art- he describes ballet as a second-rate form of expression- but it is unfair to compare him, as one reviewer did to Angel Clare (the faithless husband in Hardy's \"Tess of the D'Urbervilles\"). He never insists that Victoria should abandon ballet altogether- he merely insists that she should not work with Lermontov, whom he dislikes with good reason, seeing the older man as a threat to his marriage. Victoria's dilemma is that she believes that she needs Lermontov to inspire her creatively and that she could not reach the same heights of excellence with another ballet company. It is her inability to resolve this dilemma that leads to the film's tragic conclusion.Of the three main actors, I found that the weakest was Marius Goring as Julian. The lovely Moira Shearer, however, is enchanting as Victoria. Shearer was herself a ballerina who made her acting debut in this film. Anton Walbrook is excellent as Lermontov. It would have been easy to make him simply a bully out to ruin the happiness of two young people, but Walbrook invests him not only with dignity but also with a sense of pathos. At their best Powell and Pressburger were capable of producing work of the very highest quality, some of the best films ever made in Britain. (Walbrook also starred in two of their other great films, \"49th Parallel\" and \"The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp\"). \"The Red Shoes\" is among their finest works. 9/10",

She gives up her career to be with Julian, which as far as I'm concerned, was a big mistake. Lermentov believes you can't have it all; you have to marry your career.The centerpiece of the film is the exciting, elaborate \"Red Shoes\" ballet, which is an allegory for Victoria's own life. Shearer is wonderful in the role, though she has always said she wished she danced better. As a bit of trivia, she was part of the Sadler's Wells Ballet when it came to the U.S. after the film was released. The prima ballerina was Margot Fonteyn. Guess who got all the attention?

Both wish to work with the Ballet Lermontov and Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook), who lives only for the ballet, is shrewd enough to hire them both.  After shaky starts, they achieve first success when Vicky plays the lead in Craster's 'The Red Shoes' at Monte Carlo.  But Lermontov demands total commitment to their art, so when Vicky and Craster fall in love, they must leave the company.  They marry.  Some time later, Vicky returns to Monte Carlo on holiday.  Lermontov relents and she is again to star in 'The Red Shoes'.  Unexpectedly, her husband turns up to reclaim her, with tragic consequences.Who but Powell and Pressburger would have the nerve to present an entire ballet, specially written, within a feature film drama?  The \"Wanna Dance\" sequence in \"Singin' in the Rain\", is, though magnificent, but a bagatelle compared with the \"Red Shoes\" ballet.  The ballet itself is lavishly staged and is a clever cheat, slipping smoothly in and out of the theatre into a world of pure cinema, seeing with the eyes of the audience at one moment, then looking out into an amphitheatre filled with swirling colours.  So, too, the more prosaic moments are perfectly rendered, with the wonderful sense of colour and design and costume that is a badge of The Archers.  And the dancers!  Robert Helpman and Leonide Massine (also the choreographer) dazzle us with their energy and command.  And the puppeteer, or rather the Shoemaker to the the Ballet Lermontov, sits in his Monte Carlo office.  To Vicky's Sylphide he is the basilisk gargoyle that sits on the parapet outside his window.Anton Walbrook delivers a masterly performance as the fanatical, tyrannical, director of the Ballet.  He can be ice cold, but then, a faint smile will seem filled with warmth.  Every nuance of his performance is perfectly timed and delivered.  In his final, passionate, pleading that Vicky abandon love and dedicate herself to dance, he glances momentarily at her dresser, indicating that Vicky is ready to put on her shoes.  He calculates and he controls them all.  But he has miscalculated, and his subsequent address to the theatre audience is delivered with raw chunks of grief, his voice strained, rasping.  Marius Goring, too, is completely convincing as the young musician, his every word and action witnessing his commitment to his art.  So, too, the collection of Russian emigres around Lermontov give sympathetic and well-modulated performances.  Brian Easdale's music supplies all that is needed credibly to support the claims of the film.  But, in the end, even amongst such talent, it is the image of Moira Shearer that endures, dancing her heart out in the ballet, then losing it in the shocking closing scenes.",

This film is quite simply an incredible example of what can be done via the medium of cinematic art. The story itself is a simple one. A dancer and a composer are independently employed by a great ballet producer, and are immediately set to work in a new adaption of a Hans Christian Andersen story called The Red Shoes. As a result of the intense connection between the music and dance these two people are brought together through their art and fall in love, much to the great anger of the producer. As the story progresses we discover that life indeed imitates art.The Red Shoes is a visual and aural tour de force. The central 20 minute sequence that depicts the performance of the ballet illustrates this fact and is undoubtedly the highlight of the film overall. Its presentation is far from a straight stage performance. Instead, it intertwines realistic ballet performance with fantasy visuals and expressionistic use of colour. In other words it combines theatre production with cinematic artistry. In this way it maximizes the power of its medium and uses it to emphasize both the beauty and emotions of the piece. It's one of the most brilliant and spectacular moments in contemporary fantasy cinema. And is unquestionably worth the price of admission alone.Although I know next to nothing about ballet, I was taken in by the whole thing and was surprised to discover that I loved the graceful dance routines. The fairytale narrative of The Red Shoes was quite beautifully told via this particular medium and intertwined into the contemporary story quite beautifully. Moira Stuart was a perfect choice in the lead role, due to her background as a professional dancer. Her flame-haired and porcelain skin were a great combination in a film that is surely one of the greatest examples of the use of Technicolor. The dramatics out-with the ballet were certainly on the melodramatic side, but they do fit in perfectly with the tone of heightened realism as a whole. But more than anything, The Red Shoes is a celebration of cinema as artistic expression. The colours and photography are mesmerizing; this truly is the place where artistic brilliance and huge commercial success have beautifully collided.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.Over the past two years, I've been working to see and understand what I think important in film. My primary value is in the exploration of selfreferential storytelling. That's where the story in the film is about the story of the film. The filmmakers have surrogates. The film is represented therein by a show or writing of some kind.Another thing that I value is the self-aware, active camera. That's one that participates in the action. Clearly, this an the self-referential construction can support each other. But the cinematic camera can go places not reducable in narrative terms.The third thing surprised me. I've become enchanted with the role that redheaded women play in film. I believe their use can carry significant power, and that some sophisticated entanglement between reflecting and creating society is at work.Well, this film has all three. It has a lovely redhead. She is the subject of the film and also the creator of the show within the show. She is the focus of the motion around her and the generator of motion which illuminates all. The film can be seen as her own fairytale, beginning in her dream with her in princess garb going up that marvelous stairway. And she is absolutely enchanting until the end where she has to act and can't quite pull it off. But she is photographed as a person with a loving lens.And this film is deeply, deeply self-referential. I think it springs from the similarly structured, French `Children of Paradise,' of a couple years prior. The initial backstage scenes are strikingly similar as well. `Who's in charge?' The important similarities are the focus for multiple control over a girl, the nesting of performance within the performance and the mixing of the creation of the film with the creation of the performances displayed. The Hungarian producer has a surrogate in the impresario played by a Hungarian, the director in the composer. The girl is an actress, a character as dancer and the character within the dance. All three are cursed by the strength of the story to take over the reality in which it is placed. I love this stuff.But there's more: this is the first time to my knowledge where the camera self-consciously enters the action, changes reality, even creates new frames of reality> The camera dances. The camera allows the dancer and magical shoes to create their own realities. The camera is never a static audience, even in the framing sections that come before and after the ballet. This camera, in this film, changed our visual imagination forever.And it has the best DVD extras I have ever seen. The Jeremy Irons/Humbert connection is delicious.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 4: Every visually literate person should experience this.",

Maybe it's because I am not a huge fan of ballet, or just found all the goings-on rather pretentious, and over-dramatic, but this movie was OK, not great.

            "content": "A fascinating glimpse into life behind the theater curtain, gorgeous color photography and a number of well-staged ballet sequences are the factors that make THE RED SHOES such a wonderful film to watch. On top of that, the performances are masterful--especially Anton Walbrook as a theater impresario with an obsessive drive to control the girl he believes he can mold into the finest ballet dancer (Moira Shearer). Shearer's flaming red hair reminds one of a British Susan Hayward with the delicate features of Vivien Leigh. Marius Goring is the struggling young composer who falls in love with her as they collaborate on THE RED SHOES and gives one of the film's most interesting performances in a vivid role.I know that it was the intention to give the viewer a glimpse of \"The Red Shoes Ballet\" as it exists inside Moira Shearer's mind--but it illustrates a point of weakness that is always present when we are watching--presumably--a stage presentation in the movies. None of the scenes could realistically have been performed before an audience of theatergoers. It's all strictly cinematic in conception. While I view this as a flaw, I'm sure other devotees of this film don't.Marred only by an ending that seems too hurried to be accepted but does follow the framework of the Hans Christian Anderson fairytale.All in all, a rich viewing experience not to be missed if you want to see the best of British film-making in the late '40s and their truly wondrous use of color in film.

I was moderately impressed, mostly by the centerpiece, the titular ballet, but felt that it lacked something, too. I was hoping that it would connect more on a second viewing, as at least one other Archers film did, Black Narcissus. Unfortunately, I liked it even less. Let me establish this right away: that centerpiece is one of the best pieces of cinema ever created. But each of the hours on either side of that is nothing special at best, something awful at worst. The direction is once in a while good, a couple of times great, but the script is generic and emotionless. The actors are generally dull. I disliked both Marius Goring and Anton Walbrook the first time around (both of whom I liked in other Archers films). I still didn't like Goring, but I absolutely hated Walbrook the second time. He seems to be channeling Hitler through most of the film, or maybe Werner Klemperer (especially when he makes that announcement at the end of the film). Part of it is certainly his character. Pressburger just doesn't give him any humanity whatsoever, and I just can't sympathize with him. I remember liking Moira Shearer a lot the first time around, but I found her acting pretty bad this time. I guess I was just fooled because she is so beautiful. That happens sometimes, of course. Can't criticize her dancing, though. She does a lot of mugging with those big, beautiful, deeply blue eyes, but not much acting. The only actor whom I still like is L\u00e9onide Massine, who plays Grischa, the lead male dancer. The script holds 90% of the film's problems. The characters are very poorly developed, for the most part. Walbrook's would be good if he weren't such an execrable one. The plot is made up of cliches, and the parts that are not seem rather forced to me. Yet I can't dislike the film. Powell and Pressburger are just too clever with their direction. I think, for instance, how romantic that scene in the buggy would be if it were to be found in A Matter of Life and Death, my favorite film from the pair. And the centerpiece! Again, I can't stress how much I love it. It brought me to tears. Of course, so did the rest of the film, but those were tears of boredom. I'll just proclaim that it is, if not the greatest sequence in cinema, the greatest sequence in cinema to be found in a mediocre film. 7/10.",

            "content": "The team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger direct and write one of the great ballet melodramas of all time. Hans Christian Andersen's tragic fairy tale serves as the outline for a film about a backstage love story. The film's core relationship between the impresario and dancer was a take on the one between Diaghilev and Nijinsky. It's the kind of dance film that can appeal to a wide audience not just balletomane devotees.Originally, Emeric Pressburger's story was commissioned by producer Alexander Korda for his wife-star Merle Oberon (Oscar nominated for \"Wuthering Heights\" in 1939). One problem was Oberon could not dance. Pressburger then bought the story back and decided to co-direct it with partner Michael Powell with Moira Shearer, a pro dancer who could also act, in the lead. Red-haired Shearer was then a ballerina at Sadler's Wells. In the film, she is joined by such skillful dancers as L\u00e9onide Massine, Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina, and Robert Helpmann, who also worked on the choreography.It begins when a talented but impoverished musical composer Julian Craster (Goring) attends a London performance of the Lermontov Ballet Company and recognizes his own score being performed without his authorization. Complaining to ballet impresario Boris Lermontov (Walbrook - who gives the films best performance), things get resolved when the composer is hired to compose the score for his next work -- a ballet version of \"The Red Shoes.\" It's based on Hans Christian Anderson's story about a pair of magical shoes that permit their wearer to magically dance without ever stopping. The impresario also hires a gifted sweet young flaming red-haired dancer, Victoria Page (Moira Shearer, the Sadler's Wells ballerina's debut as an actress), to perform in the ballet.The centerpiece of the film is a stunning 20 minute ballet sequence, where we see The Red Shoes performed, first on traditional stages, but then on increasingly expressionistic and fanciful sets, until it's clear that the brilliant dance and music have taken the performance away from anything approaching reality, onto a plane of pure art, where such things as the laws of physics and time and space don't seem to apply. It's a heartbreaking and wonderful experience. Leonide Massine, who plays the choreographer and who created the unforgettable character of the Shoemaker within the ballet, is considered to be one of the greatest choreographers in the Western World, creating over 50 ballets. It is he, not Moira Shearer, who makes the ballet sequence so entrancing (and I can't say that I traditionally like ballet). You just can't take your eyes off him. Not bad for someone that his mentor, Sergei Diaghilev, called nothing but a good-looking face and poor legs.As a result, the ballet is well received and Julian and Victoria fall madly in love. Meanwhile Boris recognizes how talented Victoria is and puts all his energy into making her the perfect dancer and a slave to her art, as The Red Shoes is set to go on tour throughout Europe. Things get dicey when Julian leaves the company and Victoria marries him over the objections of the overbearing and jealous Svengali-like Boris, who believes her art comes before love. Boris uses his power to prevent her from dancing the role that brought her fame. After the music stops the film comes down from its lofty heights to tell its mundane story. The dancer misses performing her magical role and after meeting the impresario by accident after a long time not seeing him agrees to dance for him again just one more time, thus missing her possessive hubby's premiere of his new work. There's a hidden \"gayness\" to all these melodramatic moves as the three protagonists in the concluding scene in Monaco confront one another and each makes an earnest case for how they stand. It leads to a tragic ending for the dancer who is torn between love and her world of dancing.The Red Shoes is one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking films one could ever see, certainly one of the best uses of Technicolor cinematography (if not the best) in the history of film. It's one of the best looks at the tensions that tear at artists who want to devote their lives to their art but find themselves entangled in the affairs of humanity. It's also a very good portrait of the difficulties a woman in the 1950s had deciding between her career and her so-called womanly duties as a wife and mother. Directing/producing/writing team Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger did not--could not--make a bad film in the whole decade of the 1940's or the years bookending it, but with The Red Shoes they created one of the screen's great tragedies.",

            "content": "There are many films about ambitious young people trying to make a career in showbusiness. Think about \"All about Eve\" (1950, Joseph Mankiewicz, film), \"Singin in the rain\" (1952, Stanley Donen, musical) and \"A star is born\" (several years, several directors, pop music). In al these films the aim is stardom and the means is getting to know the right acquaintances (by chance or by manipulation).Not so in \"The red shoes\". Here the aim is perfection and the means are total dedication or (formulated differently) bedevilment. In this respect \"The red shoes\" has much more in common with films such as \"Black swan\" (2010, Darran Aronofsky) and \"Whiplash\" (2014, Damien Chazelle) than with the above mentioned films.Central in \"The red shoes\" are the characters of Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) as the impresario of the ballet Lermontov, Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) as a young ballet dancer and Julian Craster (Marius Goring) as a young composer. Victoria and Julia are discovered by Boris Lermontov, but during the course of the film they fall in love with each other. This much to the displeasure of Borils Lermontov, who demands of his collaboraters total dedication to their art form. It is impossible to combine a human romance with this total dedication (is the opinion of Boris Lermontov). And so Victoria Page has to choose between her love for Julian Crastor and her love for ballet.In \"The red shoes\" Boris Lermontov is a sort of Mephistopheles. When you sell your soul to him, he delivers greatness (in for example a specific art form) but there is no way back. Surprisingly I did not find the charcter of Lermontov less sympathetic than that of Craster. Apart from the fact that Walbrook is a beter actor than Goring, I think there are a few other reasons. In a certain dialogue Lermontov asks Victoria if she would ask Craster to give up music. When she says that she would never do that he asks on what ground Craster can ask her to give up ballet. Lermontov certainly has a point here. In another scene we are witnesses of the marriage of Page and Craster. They sleep in seperate beds (unusual for a newly married couple) and Julian stands up in the middle of the night to rehearse a new piece of music. How deep does their love go?\"The red shoes\" is based on the fairy tale of the same name by Hans Christian Andersen. This fairy tale character is most prominent in the best known scene of the film, a ballet sequency of more than a quarter of an hour. This ballet sequence begins as a life performance but than assumes a surreal character as it reflects the subjective emotions of Victoria Page while performing. This scene easily matches and even surpasses famous long dancing scenes as in \"The earrings of Madame de ... \" (1953, Max Ophuls), \"Il Gattopardo\" (1963, Luchino Visconti) and particularly (as this is also a surreal sequence) the Broadway melody sequence with Cyd Charisse in \"Singin in the rain\" (1952, Stanley Donen).The scene is a perfect co-operation between actress (Moira Shearer, one of the most beautiful red heads I have ever seen), set design (Hein Hecktoth) and cinematographer (Jack Cardiff).",

            "content": "After the War, the British-based writing production and direction team of Emrich Pressburger and Michael Powell's cinematic ambition grew apace. Following on from one of my all-time favourites \"A Matter Of Life And Death\", came this fantastical almost operatic piece purporting to be a backstage drama set in the balletic and classical music world. The opening scene of a horde of young students charging into a theatre for the cheap seats to a programme of classical music looks incredibly anachronistic today, as indeed does much of the film with its highly mannered acting replete with cut-glass accents and flashing eyebrows everywhere.Thus my point about opera where the players have to aim for the back row with both voice and gesture, accompanied by an other-wordly plot and of course a Carmen-like death at its conclusion. In fact for the first half-hour the action is somewhat stilted as we're introduced to the almost clich\u00e9d characters of the aspiring young composer, played by a wide-eyed Marius Goring, the pretty deb-cum-prima-ballerina Moira Shearer with even wider eyes and widest eyes of all Anton Wallbrook as the dastardly dictatorial musical producer, Mr Lermontov. The movie titles are very quick to posit the \"Any resemblance to the living\" legend which makes me wonder if some of the characterisations were drawn from the real world, but it all rolls along quite conventionally until Ms Shearer dons the red shoes and we're transported into high fantasy with the arguments of life versus art, life imitating art and art for art's sake played out by the three principals.Shearer's extended \"Red Shoes\" sequence at the centre of the film must be one of Powell's most imaginative pieces and from there to the end, we're treated to dazzling visuals, arresting music and wonderful ballet dancing. Especially memorable in this fifteen minute segment are Shearer's jumping into the red shoes initially and her later dance with a newspaper which comes magically to life. To be truthful, the human story gets lost somewhat along the way under the glory of set-pieces such as this, but then again, I understand that plot isn't really what attracts people to the opera anyway.This film will be remembered above all else for Shearer's beauty as the doomed heroine, destined to play out the \"Red Shoes\" legend to its tragic conclusion and director Powell's wonderful vision in elevating the world of the theatre to the screen in a glorious construction of music and colour.",

            "content": "The Red Shoes is what a dictionary is for: if you flip to any of those high remarks of comment: beautiful, gorgeous, hypnotic, daring, you may find the movie listed as a prime example. What Powell and Pressburger achieve with their film is a multi-faceted classic of art forms. There's dance, there's melodrama, there's sweeping production design, there's Technicolor, and there is the classical music performed to accompany the ballet. It crosses over from being just a movie about dance or a drama about dancers in love or even a movie about an obsessed ballet company director who can't stand to part with his prized possession into being a piece of art that can be enjoyed by anyone. Take it from me, the last place I would usually be found is at a ballet. But this is a movie I intend to see many times over in my lifetime.On the outset one (me) wondered if it would be much like the Hans Christen Anderson fable, about a woman who puts on red shoes and can't take them off and in the end, as the ballet impresario Boris Lermontov so simply puts it, \"she dies, that's it.\" It is and it isn't. It starts off, for at least the first hour, looking like a version of the 1933 film 42nd Street (a theater company putting on a Broadway show) as it shows the taskmaster Lermontov prepare his next show, with the addition of a new composer, a young upstart Julian Craster (Goring), and a young woman Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) who impresses him with the very simple question to a question: \"Why do you want to dance?\" \"Why do you want to live?\" From then on Victoria, slowly but surely, becomes a fixation for Lermontov, putting her forward from the background of the line of dancers to front and center and then, ultimately, the main part of the Red Shoes, which he has Craster rewrite completely.We see how this one decision, one that Lermontov sees as just another part of his word-as-command motions, changes everything, for the better for Victoria and Julian as artists and in their careers (and as lovers), and for worse for Lermontov. Conventional wisdom would think that Lermontov, as performed by the dark-eyed and deviously subtle Walbrook, is jealous and wants Victoria all to herself romantically. This is not correct, though it's fair to think that as it's invited to expect it. Powell and Pressburger subvert this expectation by emphasizing how much Lermantov wants Victoria not for love but for, quite the opposite of Julian, his own sort of creation. \"Do you want to be the greatest dancer in the world?\", he basically asks Page point blank? Her response is, simply, yes, without even thinking about it. What is most intriguing is not even so much how Lermontov acts but how Victoria does, too. For every artistic quasi puppet master, frankly, there is probably a puppet somewhere.And while the story of this strange love-not-love triangle takes us along - and, first and foremost, Powell and Pressburger are consummate storytellers of a near perfectionist nature within their studio-bound limits - it becomes like a fable unto itself. It borrows from Hans Christen Anderson mostly for its centerpiece, which is the actual Red Shows ballet production on stage. This is such a staggering set-piece because it transcends the stage and the audience (we never see the audience itself, a contrast to the opening of the film where we mostly saw audience and little dancing), and becomes just pure cinema. Powell and Pressburger invite- no, demand, that you watch and be absorbed by how Victoria Page becomes absorbed into this world of the Red Shoes, and the sets and color palette reflects this, not to mention how characters go and transform into others (she sees Julian and Boris transform at one point, and then Julian on stage with her). It's so immediate and passionate and awe-inspiring that you could watch it over and over for a week and not attain all of the layers of craftsmanship and style. Only the climax of Singin' in the Rain tops it for sheer spectacle and heart-thrilling magnitude, and just barely.It borrows from the fable for that, yes, but also towards the end of the film it becomes all the more clear that it is in fact a real-life fairy tale, which makes it all the more frightening and haunting. Victoria may be trapped forever in her own ambitions, and the metaphor of the title is just far too much, and the inevitable happens (it's not spoiling since, frankly, it is part of the original fable). And yet most remarkable is that one knows that the film is only in part, on the surface, about this (putting it lightly) ambitious woman with fiery red hair and a determined face in love with this equally brilliant composer. It's really about something deeper, more elemental to people in general. Critics often cite the exchange between Victoria and Boris about dancing and living that I mentioned earlier in this review as a key moment, but the one for me is at another point in the film. The exchange happens between Boris and one of his stagehands: \"You can't alter human nature.\" \"No? I think you can do even better then that. You can ignore it!\"Throughout the film, we see human nature put up on the screen, as vibrant and as beautiful and (sometimes) disturbing as anything else in movies, and how Boris is doomed precisely because of his ignoring nature of what people really are. And it's his conflict, his ultimate demise, that makes the film so tragic and elevates it from being tawdry melodrama or just another ballet movie. Quite frankly, unless something of a sucker punch comes along, I don't need to see another 'ballet movie' for quite a long while, if ever.",

What sets the film apart, however, is the actual production of the ballet, which directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger give us in a visually stunning extended sequence, using various film effects to enhance its dreamy feeling. You don't have to be a lover of ballet to appreciate the artistic beauty of these scenes, and it's no wonder the film won Oscars for Best Art Direction and Best Score. Shearer being asked to choose between a husband and a career may be a little maddening and sound familiar to women, but the demand is not from her husband, it's from her producer. The ballet shoes that she puts on which promise worldwide fame are a bit of a Faustian bargain, with Walbrook's character Mephistopheles.

Thanks to a new score by a new conductor (Marius Goring) the show is a huge success but the dancer and conductor fall in love, which is something that the manager is against because he believes ones focus should always be on the work. THE RED SHOES has been called one of the greatest films ever made by many people but it also has a fair number of critics who call it nothing but melodrama. The thing that took me by complete surprise is how one could make an argument both ways but the amazing thing is that the story might be 100% melodrama but directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger don't let that stand in their way. The story of a dancer falling in love with the man who made her a star only to make someone else jealous could have came from a dozen Hollywood musicals but the directors of this take that story and turn it into so much more. I was really impressed with the way the personal drama has an effect on the work and the decision of doing something you've always wanted and questioning yourself on if it's more important than love. Of course, the performances by the three stars are a major plus here as all of the actors fit their roles perfectly and really bring them to life. This is especially true of Walbrook who is simply divine as the manager who demands work to be the most important thing. Another key thing to the film's magic is the wonderful cinematography by Jack Cardiff who really brings the film to life and gives it a fable look that makes it feel so original. There's also no question that the Technicolor really helps and especially during the ballet of The Red Shoes. At 133-minutes the film never seems too long and even when you think you know where it's going. Again, story wise there's nothing ground-breaking here but when you put everything together you're really left with something special, unique and fresh.",

This is a boatload of clich\u00e9s without the nuance I've come to expect from Powell & Pressburger. This is a movie with one measly idea, and it takes both too long to get to it, and too long to finish up.I was watching the clock for the entire first hour. I never found this movie the slightest bit engaging, because it repudiates everything that film does well. It's like taking the worst part of Oklahoma (the dream ballet) and making it three hours long. It reminded me of the quote \"Talking about music is like dancing about architecture,\" it may also be like reducing film to the conceits of the stage. Abstract ballet is still vital and compelling. Narrative ballet is about as relevant and heavy-handed as silent film, even when done by P&P, even with film tricks. Perhaps if I was an exceedingly girly thirteen year old... The only pleasure I got out of this was when I began fast-forwarding over gratuitous ballet performances and melodrama in the final hour.Any crappy movie can make you conclude, \"Gee, that was pretty.\" It's a rare movie that makes you think. (about anything!) Powell/Pressburger films usually do. But this was exactly the movie I expected and dreaded.

Okay--half the movie or so is ballet, so automatically it CAN'T be a great movie to some. But, what did I like? Well, the cinematography was gorgeous for 1948 and the acting was generally first-rate. But, the ending of the movie was a letdown because it seemed a bit silly and overwrought. Plus, I was REALLY hoping someone would punch that really pompous producer (Boris Lermontov) in the nose instead--now THAT would have been a great ending! So, in conclusion, if you LOVE ballet, this movie will make you go nuts because it is so wonderful.

He loses one prima ballerina to love, and sees his new young ing\u00e9nue, Victoria, following down the same path. In Boris's mind, the Hans Christian Anderson tale of The Red Shoes rings true, once the dance begins, it should consume all. It is the only thing that matters. Heart and mind and soul must be in the performance. Vicky initially wants nothing more from her life but to dance, but by the end of the movie, she has to choose between her passion for ballet and her passion for the rest of her life. Alas, some decisions are too difficult to make.\u00a0One of the coolest parts of The Red Shoes are the ballet performances. Elaborate choreography and costumes are made even more impressive by the excellent special effects (especially for the 1940's!)\u00a0that augment Victoria's performances as she completely submerges herself in the music and the dance. The imaginative and surreal sequences take us from the passive perspective of the audience to a view from the other side, where the dancer transcends performance and accepts the dance as their reality. The rendition of The Red Shoes ballet that comes about halfway through the movie was my personal highlight of the entire film. It's really awesome.For a movie like this to thoroughly impress someone who doesn't have any particular fondness for dancing or dancing movies, well, that just lets you know how good it must be.

At breakfast the next morning Lermontov also meets an inspiring young composer by the name of Julian Craster (Marius Goring) and he too is invited to join the company. The two talented youngsters begin to work their way up through the company ranks as a romance blossoms between them. There are tough decisions to be made however when it comes to a choice between ambition and love.I bought The Red Shoes of Blu-Ray about three or four years ago after hearing Martin Scorsese say it was one of his favourite films. Now I've finally seen it I can see why someone would enjoy it on an artistic and technical level but it left me feeling very bored.The first thing to strike me about the film was its wonderful use of colour. Everything is so bright and vivid and it's incredibly striking. Although Technicolor had been invented in 1916 it wasn't widely used in the film industry until the 1940s. After the success of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, studios began to think of the medium as the future. The use of colour in The Red Shoes is stunning and is definitely one of the highlights of the film for me. I wondered if the colour was made to be so bright and vivid because the directors were working in a relatively new and unexplored medium, just as today 3D films seem to make an extra effort to have things poking out of the screen at the audience. Unlike 3D which is in my view rarely if ever improves a film, the colour in The Red Shoes most definitely enhances the viewing experience.The plot revolves around a story within a story with Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tail The Red Shoes being performed inside the film. I was never really interested in the characters and I think this is because the film was very predictable. I was always one step ahead, able to anticipate what was coming next. This was true even of the shocking ending which I worked out just a couple of minutes earlier. This isn't a film with twists or surprises. Even so I thought that the ending was done very well and I loved the thirty seconds on stage after the 'surprise'. I thought it was beautiful and moving. One of the problems I had with the film was my indifference to ballet. I've tried to enjoy it a couple of times when I've been to see ballet and although I have huge admiration for the ability of the dancers I can't help but find it confusing and dull. I'd love to be able to say I can follow a ballet but I just can't. As about a third of the film is purely dancing I often found my mind wandering to other things.Although I'm no ballet fan I did find the performance of The Red Shoes ballet sometimes interesting. The fairy tail element peaked my interest a little and it felt almost surrealist at times. I was reminded of Disney's Fantasia at various moments. The prolonged dance scene half way through was also very well edited. The costumes' were also well designed and the music, although not to my taste, was excellent. Occasionally the film was overacted, perhaps in part due to the cast been predominantly ballerinas first, actors second. I let this go slightly as a lot of the cast were working in their second or third language. Both leads were very good and Anton Walbrook stood out as the charismatic but vicious impresario. Another thing I liked was to see London's Covent Garden as it was in the 1940s. It's an area I've been though many times and looks very different today. The same is true of Paris and Monte Carlo which are also interesting to see over sixty years ago.For me The Red Shoes is a lot like ballet itself. It is admirable and I wanted to enjoy it but I often felt bored and kind of couldn't wait for it to be over.www.attheback.blogspot.com",

            "content": "Perhaps like no other film I've ever seen, I've put off watching The Red Shoes for as long as I can remember. Maybe it's because the film is focused on dancing (something I have barely any interest in), or the inflated running time. It might be a combination of these things. Regardless, even by the time it was over, the movie failed to change my thoughts on an art form I've never thought of as very exciting. Despite the fact that I will probably never find enjoyment in ballet or anything related to it, I can at least appreciate what is often labeled one of the best British movies ever. Like many other films around this time period, a love triangle is what makes the story advance, since without this, the ballet wouldn't have a leg to stand on (no pun intended). The story begins with a ballet performance at a London opera house, organized by Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook). In attendance are a music student named Julian and an aspiring dancer named Victoria Page (Marius Goring and Moira Shearer respectively). After the show, Lermontov and Vicky meet each other and the former asks her to go to a rehearsal with him. Meanwhile, Julian writes an (according to him) silly letter to Boris, in which he explains that his music teacher has ripped off one of his compositions. Julian shows up too late since it turns out Boris has read the letter already. Still, Julian proves to him that he is the one behind the work (Hearts of Fire) by playing it for him on his piano. Boris is so impressed with him that he hires him to coach his ballet dancers, and also to assist Lermontov's main conductor. Later on, Julian and Vicky arrive at the Mercury Theatre, where the latter dances to Swan Lake by Tchaikovsky. After witnessing what a talented ballerina Vicky is for himself, Lermontov takes it upon himself to invite her to France (and later Monaco) with him. While in Monaco, he says how he wants her to be the lifeblood of his new ballet, \"The Ballet of the Red Shoes.\" Julian is going to compose for it. As Vicky and Julian work together on Boris' project, they learn to hold each other's talents in high regard. When the time comes for the play to debut, it's a great success, but behind the scenes, Vicky and Julian have fallen for each other. Lermontov eventually finds out about their relationship; something that's supposed to be kept secret. Julian is relieved of his music related duties, and Vicky chooses to leave with him to get married. However, Boris doesn't want to lose such a good source of talent (and revenue), so he seeks out Vicky at a train station. He tells her to put on the red shoes once more, since that's what made her such a hit in the first place. On the night of a new play, Vicky is in her dressing room when Julian and Lermontov appear simultaneously. Each one of them tries to convince her that her only chance at being happy is to go with them. Boris says how she always wanted to be a dancer, so she should focus on that, and Julian tries to remind her of her affection toward him. Vicky, tears in her eyes, comes to the decision that her commitment to being a dancer is more important than Julian and tries to go to the stage. As Julian departs for the train station dejected, Vicky suddenly has a change of heart and goes after him. She jumps over a balcony and lands right in front of an oncoming train and gets struck. Boris gets on the stage and makes the announcement that nobody wants to hear: Miss Page won't be performing tonight (or ever). As a nod to her, they perform the Red Shoes instead of what was originally planned, and Vicky dies holding Julian outside. While I thought this movie was very long for what it is, I do at least admire how they chose to use Technicolor. After all, with a color in the title, there was no reason not to use it. The coloring process was expensive, but for an elaborate movie like this with a lot of scenic locations and ornate buildings, it had to be done. Even though I typically despite musicals, I was able to watch this because it's actually a debatable question whether this qualifies as one. I personally don't consider it as such since the majority of scenes have little to do with music. Even the highlight of the movie, where Vicky performs the actual ballet, is only around 20 minutes. I was disappointed that it wasn't longer. Overall, The Red Shoes is a movie I was kind of let down with, but not because of the film itself. I feel like if I had more of an interest in dance, I would have loved it, but as it is, it just felt like a love story with a ballet theme in my eyes. Add on to this the fact that it's a british production and didn't include any actors I was familiar with, and I felt like I squandered the experience for myself a little bit. Still, it's understandable why it's considered one of the best movies to be made in britain.",

But after seeing the meagre amount of comments this film has received, it's time to try.The Red Shoes is one of the most exquisite pieces of art I have ever seen, every shot is tightly composed, brimming with colour and texture, there's a real feel of the hustle and bustle of the everyday world these characters inhabit. But unlike other Powell & Pressburger films, The Red Shoes is very weak when it comes to characters. As many have pointed out there aren't really any likable characters, most are either too meek or just not emphasized enough to get a real connection with them. No this should have been first and foremost a ballet film, that sadly only features one real dance sequence, the haunting production of the titular \"Ballet of the Red Shoes\". The performances are good enough, with all three principals (Anton Walbrook, Marius Goring and Moira Shearer) delivering, but the script just doesn't fit them. However the ideas of the film are so timeless, that you can't help feel for all of them at the tragic conclusion. So I give The Red Shoes a rating of 8/10, mainly for the Red Shoes sequence and Jack Cardiff's cinematography. This is a classic that should be discovered by every generation.",

            "content": "First of all, some disclaimers \u0096 this is my first experience with Powell and Pressburger, and my knowledge of ballet is very limited. So please don't be upset if I don't offer too many insights along those lines \u0096 these are just my personal reactions and reflections on this great film on first viewing.I was mostly taken in just by the style and grace of the film, both in the musical and most of the dramatic moments. Of course in this, as with most great musical films, the line between them is fine. The actual \"Red Shoes Ballet\" itself is an astounding work of art. The themes and their application to the story are quite apparent, but this section has its own integrity and could stand alone as art. Then it's interesting to think about how the overall theme of the film is art itself \u0096 specifically the tension between art and individuality, or the works of the artist which stretch for a timeless and placeless value and the personal desires and ambitions of the artist which are limited in scope but have their own value to any person. Like I said I don't really understand ballet, but this sequence is really impressive. We're immediately clued in to the fact that we are not seeing the ballet literally as it was staged, but as a kind of impressionist picture of how it feels to be the dancer in the ballet. To the few who have complained about the fact that it's not showing things that are possible on stage, I feel only pity for those who are so habituated to the pretentiously \"realist\" styles favored in today's cinema that they won't let the cinema explore feelings and fantasy instead of the tiny portion of the human experience that actually exist within the limits of our field of vision. The point of showing the dance in the form of the dancer's impressions isn't simply to provide an interesting spectacle. It's also very important for the filmmakers to keep the focus on the artistic experience not as it would be experienced by the audience but rather as it would be experienced by the artist. In fact the audience itself becomes part of the impression, interpreted as the rolling waves of the sea. If they had not been able to accomplish this remarkable feat, the melodrama that develops \u0096 the conflict in Victoria's (Moira Shearer) heart between the domestic life offered by Julian Craster (Marius Goring) and the artistic one offered by Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) \u0096 would feel just like a shallow exercise in romance. Instead we are made here to feel the romance that the stage offers for Victoria ourselves. It's impossible for the filmmakers to give that kind of personal access into the romantic affair with Julian, and perhaps they didn't really want to. Most \"backstage\" melodramas of this era end up heavily emphasizing the appeal of the romantic/domestic situation and to various extents demonize the practitioners of art and theater. But Lermontov is definitely a more complex character than most producers on film, and the way Powell/Pressburger have shown us the dance also compels one to favor the artistic option over the domestic one.The dancers in the film are all superb, particularly Leonide Massine, who makes every scene he's in a joy to watch even for this non-ballet fan. His performance is very good in the dramatic scenes as well, highly stylized but appropriate in the theater setting. For the most part however, in my opinion the actors don't really rise to the level of the material. Shearer came off the best even though in a few of the dramatic scenes her inexperience shows; the directors have carefully protected her screen image and manage to project a kind of fantasy of artistic achievement through her excellence in the dances to the point where we're inclined to accept her in other scenes. Perhaps in an effort to reassure us that Lermontov's emotional connection with art is real and powerful and not just an excuse for melodrama, the directors have included too many close-ups of Walbrook, making his performance feel more forced than it needs to. As for goring, I wasn't too impressed with him but I found the character so hard to empathize with that it's hard to say how much is his fault and how much just depends on what he was given \u0096 mostly very difficult scenes in carriages and boudoirs that he pulls off perhaps as best he could.These are small complaints in comparison to the quality of the whole work, and probably unavoidable given the need to accommodate some of the formula of melodrama, which this film doesn't so much subvert as it does personalize. When I was watching the movie, I was fascinated with every single frame. So to me the directors came off very well. A good example of excellent direction would be in the scene where dancer Irina Boronskaja (Ludmilla Tcherina) is introduced \u0096 from a slightly wider set-up showing several actors including Goring and then only a slight movement of the camera is necessary to bring Tcherina's face into almost full-frame close-up, and another movement (as I recall, no cuts, although there might be a subtle one) as we follow them up the stairs. The scene's kinetics specifically match the feel of her character and the way she contrasts with Victoria Page. Also the direction in the ballet sequence is extraordinary; this isn't just an impressive use of FX. I noted how the directors once again had to use only minimal camera movement and editing to alternate at various points between extreme close-ups of the actress' face and the movements of her body and the other dancers.A very impressive film that I hope to rewatch in the theater some day so that I can fully appreciate the style of the dynamics of these scenes.",

Taken to it's extreme, the advice can cause much conflict, and it does when ballerina Irina Boronskaja (Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina) is forced to choose between her career and marrying the man she loves. The same predicament confronts Ms. Page when she falls in love with songwriter Julian Craster (Marius Goring), an affair that quite honestly didn't feel very credible to this viewer as the two didn't appear to have much chemistry given the story line. It would have made more sense and been a more compelling picture if Lermontov got a taste of his own medicine and was the one who went after Victoria, as then his stricture would have faced a severe test. Be that as it may, the movie will probably appeal to ballet fans, of which number I do not count myself. I'll concede that Ms. Shearer's execution of 'The Red Shoes' was beautifully performed and a tribute to her talent and stamina as a dancer, while the picture's cinematography was exceptional given the era of film making. Given it's reputation, I'm glad I got around to finally catching it, but found myself basically ambivalent toward the picture.",

            "content": "Aside from a few compulsory school-related occasions upon which I look back with the utmost antipathy, I've never danced in my life. I've never wanted to, and I plan to hold firm at least until the day of my wedding. As late as last year, I regarded ballet as among the least interesting forms of dance, my assertion based not on experience, but mere conjecture. Then I saw Norman McLaren's extraordinary short film 'Pas de deux (1968),' in which an optical printer is used to demonstrate how the dancers' movements transcend space and time, the majesty of human motion revealed in every gentle, graceful spin. Suddenly, inexplicably, I saw beauty where I'd never seen it before. I consider 'The Red Shoes (1948)' the affirmation of this revelation. The child of writing/directing team Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, under the banner of The Archers, the film showcases the pair's talent for imbuing their work with lush colours, warmth and personality, displaying a faculty for capturing atmosphere that is unmatched then or since.'The Red Shoes' revolves around the production of a stage adaptation of Hans Christian Andersen's eponymous fairy-tale, in which a ballet dancer receives a pair of cursed red shoes that keep her dancing until the day she dies. However, rather than being a simple story of success in show- business, the behind-the-scenes events are themselves a loose variation on Andersen's fairy-tale. When asked what she wants from life, young British ballerina Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) replies, \"I want to dance.\" Just as Mephisto offered Faust everything he wanted at the cost of everything he held dear, Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook, of 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943)') offers Victoria immortality in the art of ballet, but at the expense of life, love and happiness. Finally, torn between her two great loves \u2013 to her husband Julian (Marius Goring), and to ballet \u2013 she chooses to abandon both, throwing herself in front of a train as though compelled to do so by the red dancing shoes that had so overwhelmingly commanded her life.As in most Powell/Pressburger collaborations, it's not adequate to merely praise the co-directors. Hein Heckroth's costumes, Arthur Lawson's art direction, Jack Cardiff's lush cinematography, Brian Easdale's musical score; all are utterly masterful, the fruits of a alliance in which every crew member understood perfectly what was required of them. The film's incredible centrepiece is a twenty- minute balletic interlude in which the audience is shown the stage production itself, perhaps the most breathtaking and purely cinematic musical sequence I've ever seen. As Victoria Page is swept up in the fantasy of her role, she is inundated by surreal visions of Faustian tragedy and horror that deliberately recall F.W. Murnau's 1926 film. In Hollywood, 'The Red Shoes' proved hugely influential, noticeably inspiring the likes of Stanley Donen and Vincente Minnelli: 'An American in Paris (1951)' featured a similar, if not so comfortably integrated, ballet interlude, and 'The Band Wagon (1953)' feels like a sunny feature-length rebuttal to the tragedy inherent in The Archers' film.",

Based loosely on the Hans Christian Anderson story of the cursed red shoes, this is a very unusual film with over the top acting styles and offering a glimpse of the ballet world to which the non-performer is not privy. Some may find it a bit too stylized for their tastes but it draws you in, just as the red shoes weave their spell. The major players are quite good with the exception of Marius Goring, a rather bland actor. It calls for a suspension of belief to imagine Shearer giving up her one love, ballet, for Goring. Anton Walbrook is mesmerizing as Lermontov and we expect him to win in the end, although his victory is short-lived. Several well known names in ballet offer support....particularly notable are Leonide Massine and Robert Helpmann. Powell and Pressburger bought the screenplay from Alexander Korda who had planned to film it in the 1930's but didn't. Bad call by Korda since the film won 2 Oscars and has become a classic for the ages. It's a fairy tale film which is not to be missed.",

The intimate details, too, of backstage life has meant that the film has dated not a jot. Psychologically, of course, the film's study of jealously and madness is novelettish at best but is in perfect keeping with the nature of the story.

Hollywood would never have risked such a downer. But once under the red shoes spell, there is no escape. Thus, the movie amounts to a sublime blend of fable, narrative, and dance.

            "content": "\"The Red Shoes\" (1948) is a fantasy/musical/romance/drama set in the world of ballet and it could be possibly the best or one of the best ballet movies ever filmed. The red shoes of the title are from Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale about a girl who tried the shoes on and possessed by their spell, dances to her death. The shoes gave her dance unearthly ethereal lightness and elegance and she paid with her own life for them. Andersen's fairy tale was transformed into a ballet in Michael Powell's and Emeric Pressburger's glorious film. 21-year-old Moira Shearer, the real life ballerina gave a heartbreaking and awe-inspiring performance as a ballet dancer Vicky Page for whom to dance meant to live and to live meant to dance. She never included love in the equation and one day she found herself trapped in the red shoes forever just like the girl from the ballet \"The Red Shoes\" that was written by a young composer with whom Vicky fell in love. The ballet was produced for the stage by a powerful talented world famous impresario Boris Lermontov (based on Sergey Diaghilev, the head of the celebrated Russian Seasons, as brilliant as he was tyrannical, played to perfection by Anton Walbrook). The short ballet is included in the movie and it is 15 minutes of unbearable perfection where colors, music and dance blend into unforgettable delight. When you watch dancing Shearer with her glowing red hair of rare shade that matches the color of the magic shoes you would want to capture the moment of beauty and keep it forever in the vaults of your memory.9.5/10",

            "review_title": "When your art becomes your obsession !!!",
            "content": "'The Red Shoes' directed and written by the legendary British filmmaking duo Powell-Pressburger is very often called the greatest ballet film or even the greatest dance film of all time. After watching this, I can understand why. The screenplay written by Emeric Pressburger takes inspiration from the fairy tale of the same name written by Hans Christian Andersen and it employs the story within the story technique. The storyline of the film is pretty simple but effective. We are introduced to three principal characters namely Victoria 'Vicky' Page, Boris Lermontov and Julian Craster played by Moira Shearer, Anton Walbrook and Marius Goring respectively. The film can be in a basic sense described as a love triangle between the three with the seductive ghost of dancing hovering over all of them. In a way it is a horror film too, because the central theme is something that many artists have or will face in their real lives. What do you choose between your personal life and your art? This is the question that this film asks. Even if you choose one over the other, the option that you abandon will continue to haunt you. This particular issue is beautifully conveyed visually in a long uninterrupted shot of Victoria and Julian in their bedroom towards the end of the film.The acting is good from everyone. Moira Shearer's performance off the stage when she isn't dancing is good, but when she is dancing on stage, she just becomes this almost heavenly figure with unending grace, elegance and charisma. Marius Goring is also good as this talented young composer who is eager to make his mark and won't stop till he gets what he wants. But for me the stand-out performance comes from Anton Walbrook as Lermontov. He could have easily played the role in a very generic way to make the character a standard villain in the context of the film. But the depth, charm and pathos that Walbrook brings to the character elevates him from being a generic villain to a complex, interesting human being. The issue as to why Lermontov became so adamant about what choices Victoria should make has been analysed by many critics and viewers. Roger Ebert compared Lermontov to Mephistopheles since he is willing to help Victoria all the way to make her a great dancer as long as she gives him complete and unflinching obedience in return. This analogy does make complete sense from a symbolic point of view. But for me Lermontov is a human being who is lonely and has no real connection with any human being. He hides behind his mansions and flamboyant housecoats. His ballet group is his only connection with others and his family. He loves dancing and considers it his religion. He develops an intimate relationship in his heart and mind with these dancers. He became intimate with Victoria too after discovering her talent. But this intimacy is not a romantic one as far as I am concerned. He loves them as his creations. But once he accepts them, he expects these dancers to be singularly dedicated to him and his ballet with no other distractions. This is where Lermontov's comment about dance being a religion becomes a bit of an irony in itself. He calls dancing as his religion but instead he expects the dancers to take him as their god and any semblance of 'disobedience' is blasphemy. Michael Powell's direction is absolutely unflinchingly operatic. He takes Pressburger's script and conveys it in the most dramatic manner. The film's narrative comes to a halt temporarily at a point and the famous ballet sequence starts and what follows is absolutely other-worldly. Powell dissolves the distinction between cinema and ballet. Shearer is absolutely spellbinding. The ballet itself tells you everything you have to know about how the rest of the film will move along. Powell adds some dream-like elements to the ballet sequence which doesn't make it realistic, but they do make it a form of psychedelic storytelling.This is one of the most influential films of all time and I can refer to few films that were heavily influenced by 'The Red Shoes'. 'Black Swan' is a film that owes a whole lot to Powell-Pressburger's style. When it comes to the theme, a heavy resemblance can be seen in 'Whiplash' which also deals with the dilemma of how much sacrifice is someone willing to make in his/her own personal life to pursue perfection in an art-form.My favourite Powell-Pressburger film is still 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp', but even then I consider 'The Red Shoes' to be a masterpiece and a breathtaking exploration of the life struggles of an artist. A must-see for film lovers.",

Still you don't have to be a dance lover to appreciate this movie and it's well choreographed and filmed dance sequences.In its essence its basically a movie about the rise and fall of a ballet dancer. A star is being made of a young woman but her stardom comes with a price. She has to sacrifice certain things to keep her career going and she wonders throughout if it's all really worth it.Well, I'm probably making the movie sound deeper than it really is, for foremost \"The Red Shoes\" remains an accessible movie at all times, that is steadily being told. The movie benefits from its well written story and it of course also had the good fortune that it had Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, two of the movie visually impressing directors of their time.A Powell and Pressburger is always something grand and special. They already started making movies in color when most big studios were still a bit reluctant, also due to the higher cost of the whole process of course. Visually the movies are always something special and with basically every sequences they did their very best to make it come across as something visually spectacular. They also knew how to tell a relatively simple story as something epic. The drama is being handled very well throughout the movie and the characters are being portrayed greatly.Mainly due to its subject- not my favorite Powell and Pressburger movie but it remains a visually and technically superb made one as well as with some great story-telling and writing in it.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "The beautiful 35mm restoration of The Red Shoes spearheaded by Martin Scorsese and his long-time editor Thelma Schoonmaker is a sight to behold. Made in post-war Britain, this hopeful yet tragic drama-musical about a ballet dancer torn between romance and ambition is still one of the best examples of the use of Technicolor.The glowing primary colors, especially that of bright red, shine exuberantly within the frame of many of the shots, be it the red shoes or the turning red wheels of a cart. The visuals are accompanied by the quite magnificent (but not very memorable) Oscar-winning score, elevating the film into a dream-like fantasy.Perhaps the most effective directing partnership the world has ever seen, at least in the context of cinema of the forties and fifties, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger have given us a number of well-received works such as A Matter of Life and Death (1946), Black Narcissus (1947), and The Red Shoes, the latter often thought of by many to be their finest achievement.Based on the story by Hans C. Andersen, The Red Shoes is given the filmic treatment by Pressburger, who wrote the original screenplay. As Moira Shearer plays Victoria Page, a promising ballet dancer who is given the opportunity to perform The Red Shoes, her life slowly follows the trajectory of the character in Andersen's book when she falls in love with Julian Craster (Marius Goring), the ballet's music conductor. Their relationship is frowned upon by their boss and director Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook), and this creates a triangular tension that builds up to a tragedy for all parties.In the film's most talked-about sequence, the brilliantly choreographed twenty-minute stage presentation of The Red Shoes as performed by the elegant and graceful Shearer, and her co-actors, is a marvel of aesthetic beauty and technical innovation. Employing a host of special post-production optical effects and through some magnificent art direction, The Red Shoes comes alive because of the rich melding of colors, set design, and orchestrated movement.What is the purpose of life? A character answers, \"To live!\"; another answers, \"To dance!\". The film questions the nature of passion. Can passion, which is of an affective nature, help us to understand the philosophical importance of living? In the case of Page, she is torn between two passions \u2013 that of dancing, and for her lover. When the dilemmatic moment of truth arrives, can one wisely choose one passion over the other? If I could point out a flaw, the romance between Page and Craster does not seem to be developed to its fullest potential. There are two main reasons: (1) their romance came rather late and abrupt in the film, and (2) there were only a few scenes of them together, albeit one that was quite long \u2013 the horse carriage in the night scene. As a result, the romantic passion between them comes across as more weak than strong; it does not, in my opinion, warrant enough justification for Page to be forced into the romance-ambition dilemma at the end.I would still give The Red Shoes my recommendation though; it is funny, entertaining, and features several great lead performances. From a purist perspective, it also captures cinematographically (in glorious Technicolor) a period in the 20th century where black-and-white films still reign.SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",

Vicky: Why do you want to live?\"Julian: \"Vicky, VICKY, dance to whatever tempo you like, I'll follow you!\"Powell-Pressburger's re-work of the gruesome Hans Andersen tale which delightfully, then darkly depicts the eternal struggle all serious artists will face, here, impresario Lermontov (Walbrook), ballet dancer Page (Shearer) and Craster the composer (Goring): The consuming, often selfish impulse to create, versus the need to live.Like any 70s kid who tried to watch as much television as was parentally permitted, I grew on cartoons, westerns, epics, Disney and low-budget crime-dramas (noirgesse). But on viewing The-Red-Shoes, a true art-noir, my film sense soared and it hasn't landed yet. I've not seen a movie more dreamy, and like all nite visions, it is beautiful and inspiring and strange and frightening and though finally tragic and without certainties, leaves artists, lovers and sentimentalists with a lasting joy for having partaken in P&P's Technicolor\u00ae tale of the most talented love-triangle in cinema history.Consider these conundrums while watching The Archers visual (Cardiff Mills Heckroth Lawson), musical (Easdale) and scripted masterpiece (P&P Winter): 1) Is Boris jealous of Julian's place in Vicky's heart or just angered artistically as Craster blows her kisses; 2) Does Vicky breach a moral-contract with Lermontov, an act of severance he'd seen before (Irina), by engaging romance with a co-worker that proves incongruent with achieving artistic greatness (\"You CAN'T have it both ways!\"), or, is her break justified by what Ljubov calls \"human nature\" and its necessities that are impossible to ignore; 3) At THE END, as Vicky is torn by her love for Julian and passion for her art that includes Boris (she'll dance no other ballet), the Shoes seem to decide her fate in life as on stage (see her look of terror as they take control), or, is it Vicky who chooses death, making shoes the scapegoat, better that if she cannot dance (\"Why .. want to live\")?The battle between art and life is ever present. Appreciate too its charms and variation in voices. The evolution of conductor Livy (Knight), first jealous, then fearful and finally supportive of the young genius, Julian. Montague to Craster: \"It's marvelous (his score)! I just wish .. oh, go on (pushes him on stage)!\" At the Royal Opera House, Miss Page, who plots to mouse-trap the impresario, upon hearing he's accepted the invite to party, gives an impressed eyebrow raise that denotes her station and confidence. In the first scene, life & death of a stairway event poster (Ballet Lermontov) is metaphorical, and drink in the raven-haired beauty that is prima ballerina, Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina. Her Irina wanted love too, leaving Covent Garden to pursue it, but when the impresario beckoned her back to fill the Vicky void, le Parisian returned. The power of Lermontov.And avoid the blame-game. It has come in vogue to bash Lermontov, a \"gifted monster\" and Craster, the same sort of self-serving artist who coaxed his mate into a prison of love on her singular self-sacrifice, both who could've made Page's return stress-free on reciprocal apologies, Boris for firing Julian on spite, the latter for dismissing the ballet in anger (\"2d-rate\"). But none of the trio began their collaberation seeking romance, quite the contrary. In truth, what reasonable viewer could expect the two to be anymore capable of giving up Vicky than could they? Making a lasting love, like creating great art, is a possessive pursuit. And keep in mind, Page did have choices, her last a matter of debate. No question both men loved Vicky dearly, but as Keaton spoke of in My-Life (93), maybe they didn't \"like\" her enough to be her dear friend?What I know about ballet you could fit on a matchbook (Waterloo-Bridge: \"entrechat 6\"), even less of music composition, and yet, as I watch TRS, I feel I belong. That's great movie-making. Even a fan of Caddyshack can feel wise in writing that P&P's gem may be the greatest film ever made. And such claims are always flawed, but what an enchanting flaw it would be, if true. Ahhh, the power of The-Red-Shoes (4/4).",

Also new to the company is a young composer with whom she falls in love, thus earning the scorn of their dictatorial director.Written, produced & directed by Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger (collectively known as The Archers), the film attempts to find a middle ground between ballet & cinematic style of storytelling, and exudes the qualities of both mediums in an elegant fashion. While the mergence works in the film's favour at times, there are also moments when they are at odd with one another.The most striking aspect however is the use of colours. The vivid colour palette & grading process gives its images a facelift that makes them stand out. Editing isn't its strongest suit, for its runtime is severely felt in the second half. The characters seem interesting at first but remain distant throughout. The entire cast play their roles responsibly. And the ballet segments are executed with precision.A tad too preoccupied with getting the dance steps & gestures right than the plot & characters inhabiting it, The Red Shoes is gorgeous to look at and is beautifully orchestrated but still left me detached from anything & everything that happens in it, and eventually became a chore to sit through.

And then, I taped it too.The version of the story for this film, is about a woman named Victoria (Vicky) Page who dances in the Lermontov Ballet Co. After dancing the leading in the ballet version of the fairytale, she rose to ballerina fame. Until she fell for the ballet's composer Julian Craster. And when they married, the ballet's director Boris Lermontov got angry about it, and scornfully relents his decision to enforce Vicky's contract, and permits her to dance where and when she pleases. The one exception is The Red Shoes: Lermontov retains the rights to the ballet and ownership of Julian's music, and refuses to mount it again or allow anyone else to produce the ballet. So, I won't give you anymore details, you'll have to see the film for yourself. Also I hated the cold-hearted bastard Lermontov.I thought \"The Red Shoes\" ballet is the best part of the film. And overall, I love this film from beginning to end.",

I know that The Red Shoes was \"just-a-movie\", but, all the same, I'd still boldly go so far as to say that lurking behind its enticing, Technicolor facade lay something of a dire warning.And, like a flashing red light, that warning was definitely cautioning all aspiring, starstruck, prima ballerinas to give up the ultimate thrill of a pirouette, and be prepared to quickly snag a husband and make do with that suburban home with the white picket-fence.In other words, girls, ballet can kill you (seriously), like it did Vicky Page - So get out while you can! Believe me, once Vicky Page donned those infernal red shoes she (like a candle in the wind) was jinxed and dogged with more troubles than was Dorothy Gale (sporting the ruby slippers) in the Land of Oz.Regardless of being quite a sumptuous production, I still found The Red Shoes (with all of its backstage dramas, catty jealousies and obsessive lunacy) to be something of a bore. It didn't help matters much that, at 134 minutes, its story seemed to drag on forever, and a day.If you've already seen Darren Aronofsky's 2011 production of Black Swan (which didn't thrill me much either), then it couldn't be plainer than the nose on your face that his dreary, little movie was nothing more than a big, bloated rip-off of The Red Shoes.",

She does both a believable acting job and was brilliant in the ballet scenes. The Red Shoes are symbolic on many levels. They represent a fairy tale and symbolize the cruelties of the dancing world. Victoria must choose between a dictator producer and director played marvelously by Anton Walbrook or her love for Julian (beautifully played by Marius Goring). The cast is perfect but I would have liked to see more of Dame Marie Rambert. The art direction is colorful. For a film done in 1948 color, the red stands out especially in Moira's hair and the shoes. The ending has quite a twist too. The Red Shoes is a ballet classic movie about the loves and difficulties of such an under appreciated art form of dance, the ballet.",

            "content": "Early on in THE RED SHOES (1948), ballet company director Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) encounters tiny, young flame-haired dancer Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) at the refreshments table after a spellbinding evening of ballet. Walbrook, half-interested, half-annoyed, asks her what seems a throwaway question \"Why do you want to dance?\". The young girl considers him for a moment and coolly retorts \"Why do you want to live?\" Clearly taken aback, Walbrook replies \"I don't know why exactly...but somehow I must\". For Victoria Page, his answer describes her exact feelings towards dancing. And so THE RED SHOES (1948) follows Vicki's journey from ambitious unknown to famous ballerina, and her inability to separate the lure of art from real life.The entire production is a triumph. Powell and Pressburger, British cinema's finest collaborators in the 1940's, weave a dazzling interpretation of Andersen's story of The Red Shoes. Their regular cinematographer, the still-living Jack Cardiff, films the action in dazzling Technicolour. The sets and compositions of every scene are a masterwork- it all adds up to near-perfection. The technical wizardry is topped off by the stunning ballet sequences, most notably the mid-way set piece 'The Ballet Of The Red Shoes'. American imitators such as he Gene Kelly films ON THE TOWN (1949) and AN American IN Paris (1951) would try and replicate THE RED SHOES'(1948) re-telling of the larger story through dance, yet the THE RED SHOES (1948) stands alone.Aside from the vast technical achievements, THE RED SHOES (1948) is also astonishing for the level of engagement it provides with it's plot and characters. Shearer is amazing and entirely convincing as Vicki, caught between her artistic passion for the wondrous, almost-mythical Lermontov ballet company and her all too human love for composer Marius Goring. Walbrook is equally perfect in his role, making what should be a typically villainous, repulsive character infinitely watchable and almost sympathetic. The central love story behind THE RED SHOES (1948) ends in tragedy, yet one can forget the inevitable anguish of it's final moments for the glimpses of consuming romantic passion between \"Romeo\" Julian and \"Juliet\" Vicki, dreamily drifting through the night together in a carriage.",

More than that, it is a powerful art-house film with the theme of perfectionism, art and human feelings/love. Ballerina turned actress Moira Shearer, who died only recently, stars as Victoria Page, who quickly rises from the ranks of the lower-level dancers to star ballerina with the guidance of the imperious, cold and demanding impresario and ballet master Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook in a great performance). The relationship between them is at the heart of the film, much more so than the later relationship she develops with music composer Julian Craster (Marius Goring), with whom she falls in love. This love triangle is played out amidst the world of ballet in the 40's, directly after World War II, when such names as Leonide Massine and later on George Balanchine would become legend. Leonide Massine appears in this film as the exotic dancer Grischa Ljubov, basically a parody of himself. Ballerina Ludmilla Tcherina, herself a well-known name at the time, appears as Russian ballerina Irina Boronskaya, parodying herself as well. Shot on location in London, Paris and Monte Carlo, we follow the course of Vicky Page's phenomenal career in ballet. Again, the moving story and the stunning cinematography, make this a wonderful film of the 40's and a treasure of Technicolor. At times, the film borders on dreamy romantic escapism, as Vicky Page suddenly finds herself living the very life of the tragic character she portrays in the new and original ballet \"The Red Shoes\" adapted from the old Danish fairy tale by Hans Christian Anderson. In that tale, a ballerina puts on a pair of magic red shoes made by an eccentric shoemaker without realizing they are cursed, damning her to dance to her death. This original ballet is performed in the film, full of surreal nightmarish elements and breathtaking beauty, particularly in the choreographed dancing. The parallel between the fictional heroine she portrays and the actual woman is dramatic and ironic. Soon, Vicky Page becomes the object of Lermontov's obsession and repressed romantic love. She must choose between a normal life with Julian, whom she truly loves, or a life in the glamorous but physically demanding world of ballet. Anton Walbrook, especially, carries the film with his performance as Lermontov, who is a ballet slave-driver, making stars out of young girls and prioritizing art for art's sakes. He renounces love for himself and for his dancers for love makes them distracted and bad dancers. Coincidentally, in the Paris Opera of today, this sentiment remains.",

            "content": "Not as dark, yet definitely as disturbing as Black Swan. I had no idea what's this movie about, or what to expect of it. All I had known about this movie before watching is that it's hailed as one of the best-looking movies ever, and I couldn't agree more. This movie was shot in three-strip Technicolor, and it doesn't just look good for its time, but it dazzles and mesmerizes as if it was shot this year! It is simply one of the most beautiful movies to date. The Red Shoes is a visual carnival full with vibrant, and consistent colors that will easily captivate you as well as its characters. From the first scene I could see that the characters would be fully fleshed-out at the end of the movie. Powell and Pressburger's screenplay, who also directed the movie, gave our three main characters a lot of depth that they can be analyzed, while also balancing between them, and that by making them equally important to the main plot. Each one of the main characters has their own subplots, but I never felt there's a subplot that seems forced, or outbalance another. That wouldn't be achieved without the impeccable direction that walks a thin line between quirkiness and darkness. \n \nThe theatrical performances are completely intentional. They make me feel uneasy because the subject matter is so dark and serious. These contradictory moods made the movie painful and disturbing in its own way. Maybe in a way that kinda resembles dark comedies. You'll know that such decision is appropriate when the credits roll. You'll get a very agonizing and maddening feeling! Anton Walbrook delivered one of the best over-the-top performances ever as Boris Lermontov, a very complex, and compelling character that is hard to be understood.\nThe only hammy performance that I couldn't stand is Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina's. What a highly melodramatic! It's really unbearable and annoying. Between all the theatrical performances, this just feels off, and awkward. \nMarius Goring and Moira Shearer gave fantastic and appealing performances. \nGrischa, played by Leonide Massine, was such a very interesting character; he is the comic-relief, but it's a character that seems if it is came out of a literary work. It made me see all the other characters differently. I saw them as I saw Grischa; fictional literary characters, and it really made sense! Grischa was the key that made me see how Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger blur the barriers between cinema and literature, or theater, in a very smooth way. Powell and Pressburger proved that cinema is a real magic, and \"The Red Shoes\" ballet sequence is more than a fine example. I won't be exaggerate, even a little bit, if I said that this 15-min-long sequence is one of, if not the most enthralling and spellbinding sequences ever shot! 15 minutes of visual storytelling at its best. I was just hypnotized, and I wish it would never end. The Red Shoes is also masterfully edited. In fact, the editing is one of the main reasons this movie is timeless. The switching between one scene to another is very slick and smooth; however, there are many continuity editing glaring errors. Despite how simple this issue seems, I found that it's so obvious, and quite annoying, that I can't avoid mentioning it. All I can say is that The Red Shoes is an idiosyncratic piece of work that will never age.(9/10)",

            "content": "All the glories of this film have been articulated many times by more able commentators, so I'll just add that I still find it a powerful emotional experience. Considering how silly certain aspects of it are, when given any kind of careful thought (Shearer herself asserted the falseness of its central dichotomy between artist and lover), the sheer power of its vision overcomes any rational objection. In other words, it by-passes the mind and heads straight for the heart, which pretty much defines the word Romantic. And this is a great piece of Romantic art.Even so, the film's portrayal of the hierarchical, disciplined world of ballet has an authentic ring, as do the passions of its inhabitants, superbly and sympathetically played by the likes of Albert Basserman and Esmond Knight. The central trio are totally wonderful - I really don't think Marius Goring did anything better in his long career, and Shearer must have surpassed all expectations of her as an actress. For Anton Walbrook, praise is not enough: it is one of the great performances of cinema - the sheer accomplishment in those quicksilver changes of mood and scale invite comparisons with only the very very best.For those behind the camera, again, the highest possible praise, not least for that amazing central ballet sequence. Hein Heckroth's designs, Reginald Mills' editing, Jack Cardiff's cinematography - are all awe-inspiring: who can possibly forget images like the auditorium, as seen from the back of the stage, flooded with waves, confronting Shearer, as Goring conducts? Breath-taking stuff! And Easdale's music is excellent: essentially a melange of the three great ballet composers of the first half of the 20th century - Stravinsky, Bartok and Ravel - it presses all the right buttons at the right time, notably in the \"Red Shoes\" theme itself, which is perfect.Because of the nagging sense of silliness, I had wondered whether 9 out of 10 would be more appropriate, but when confronted with the sheer grandeur of this film, the breadth of the vision behind it, the scale of ambition matched to its complete realisation - it has to be full marks.",

            "content": "The creative force that was the Archers created a number of masterpieces, and this is probably the best known and the most influential. It's a sweeping blend of romance, drama, fairytale and tragedy, which was also a little-acknowledged great leap forward in the language of cinema.Powell and Pressburger had been experimenting with the musicality of their films for several years now, culminating in some brilliant, almost balletic moments in their previous picture Black Narcissus. With the Red Shoes however they created their first \"composed film\" as Powell described it in his autobiography. Music is an almost constant presence, and the imagery and movement always correspond to the music. The opening scene is a brilliant example (not to mention a great exercise in how to open a large-scale drama), in which the ballet performance going on all but ignored, but the music serves as a backdrop to introducing the characters and the interplay between them.The centrepiece of the whole picture is the performance of the Ballet of the Red Shoes itself. In a bold and completely unprecedented move the regular narrative entirely breaks off for a seventeen minute set piece that is both a genuine ballet performance and a piece of pure cinematic fantasy. On one level, it is a story within a story (Vicky's fate mirrors that of the heroine she plays). It is also a celebration of the possibilities of cinema, employing dozens of techniques (many of them harking back to the silent era) in order to enhance the ballet in ways that could never be done in a real performance. And yet it is never disrespectful to the older art form, as after all ballet bears a good deal of similarity to cinema, as it is story telling through music and movement.Although it's not technically a musical in the conventional sense, The Ballet of the Red Shoes certainly gave a massive boost to the evolution of the Hollywood musical. During the fifties few musicals were complete without a lengthy, slightly unreal dance sequence. Examples include the paintings-come-to-life sequence at the end of An American in Paris, or Gene Kelly's outlining of his \"Gotta Dance\" show in Singin' in the Rain. You can even see examples in the epic musical that began to appear later on \u0096 such as the \"Small House of Uncle Tom\" play in The King and I. The Ballet of the Red Shoes was the original inspiration for all these sequences, and is probably still the best.The ballet segment of The Red Shoes has also influenced successive generations of filmmakers in subtler ways. Not many would think there is a link between the Red Shoes and Martin Scorcese's violent boxing drama Raging Bull. However, Scorcese's mantra when shooting the boxing scenes was always \"stay inside the ring\". His aim was to show film the experience of the boxers, not show a tiny little ring from the audience's point-of-view. Thirty years earlier, Powell and Pressburger did the same thing with ballet. During that seventeen-minute sequence, the audience disappears, and the camera is inside the performance, not only showing us Vicky's point-of-view but also her hopes and fears through its expressionist techniques.Of course, most of these ideas had been explored before, perhaps most notably in the early Disney features which are constantly musical and merge fantasy and reality (Fantasia was a massive influence on Michael Powell). However, it's a lot harder to achieve the same effects with live action, and The Red Shoes brings back all those elements of exaggerated reality and cinema as a kind of dance which had been lost at the end of the silent era. It's also one of the earliest self-referential pieces of cinema, as it is an exploration of what it means to be a performer or a creator in a grand-scale collaborative artistic production.Talking of performers, The Red Shoes also features a nigh-on perfect cast. Marius Goring, who had already played several memorable supporting roles for the archers here gets a crack at a lead role, and does an absolutely brilliant job of it \u0096 it's a shame he never became a major star. Moira Shearer and Leonide Massine were hired mainly because they were world class ballet dancers, but their acting abilities were not far behind. Other Archers regulars like Robert Helpmann and Esmond Knight give good support, and Anton Walbrook is absolutely mesmerising as the Svengali Lermontov.The Red Shoes is one of cinema's absolutely perfect moments, without a single wrong note. Although its influence was everywhere, it remained something of a forgotten film itself for decades (typically for anything innovative or irregular, distributors regarded it as an expensive oddball), but fortunately all Michael Powell's films have recently been receiving a long overdue revival.",

Nevertheless, the film, which is not only about ballet, but for a good part also ballet itself, left a very strong impression on me. True, at times it was almost boring and the ending is overly melodramatic to me, but the overall impression is certainly positive.It is inspired by Andersen's fairy tale of the same name about a girl in enchanted red shoes, cursed to dance until her death. This fairy tale was transferred to the film with a ballet performed by our protagonists, but metaphorically also to their lives off stage.For a little over two hours, we follow the life of a young dancer, torn between love for her chosen one and her ambition to become a prima ballerina, that is, love for ballet. The girl's life story in itself did not leave a special impression on me, but the film does not concentrate only on her, but along the way realistically presents life in a \"backstage\" in quite a detail. The turbulent process of creating a theatrical play through the symbiosis of a large number of people, from composers and choreographers, set designers, through hard training of performers, to the ballet director who coordinates the whole process, often in cold-blooded and even cruel ways, combined with masterful camera and direction, especially during the surreal and mesmerizing title number, predominates over the melodrama and makes this film really noteworthy.8/10",

Based on the Hans Christian Andersen story, it is a study in obsession; the obsession of the Svengali-like Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) for his prima ballerinas, and the parallel obsession of dancer Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) to reach the top of her profession. Both characters are driven to extremes by their desires: Lermontov pushes his dancers beyond endurance, while Victoria ends up committing suicide. Technically speaking, THE RED SHOES is quite brilliant: Jack Cardiff's Technicolor photography consistently juxtaposes picture-postcard locations (in Monte Carlo and post-war London) with deliberately disconcerting shots, where the characters are photographed from disconcerting angles. We have to admire Powell and Pressburger's boldness in including a lengthy dance- sequence that rehearses the film's entire plot, and then photographing it in such a way as to emphasize the sheer strain for everyone involved, both on and off the stage. Some of the sequences are, quite simply, brilliant - for example, the point-of-view sequence where Victoria imagines the world around her moving round and round, faster and faster, as if she were caught on a roundabout and unable to get off. THE RED SHOES deserves repeated viewings, if only to understand just how brilliant the film is.",

The Red Shoes is battle of ambitious Dancer and Composer who are given wings by a smart businessman who turns obsessive and spoils their ambitions. Well, it doesn't end on powerful note because none of them stand still with thier ambition. Somehow love between them is the reason but i feel it shouldn't have been. She wanted to be the Best Dancer but she quit it, he wanted to the Composer and he also quit it then why were they so passionate at the beginning? There could have been a sensible and inspiring ending rather sad one which proves the curse of fairy tale of the Red Shoes. I waited for 135 minutes to see something intellegent or at least sensible enough at the end but i feel like i successfully wasted 135 minutes for the film in which i could have easily watched some other Classic film. There are many mistakes in execution by director as the film which is supposed to show the drama happening on stage is too unrealistic and artificial to disapprove with it's own content. Additionally, the director didn't do justice with any of 3 main characters in the film because none of them get nothing at the end. If no one is gonna get anything then why was this all mess for? The Red Shoes neither succeds to prove the philosophy of Curse nor it completes the love story and ambitions. It is not that i didn't understand the deep meaning philosophy there but it is just that i couldn't find any logic in that. A film with 8.1 IMDb rating should be better, this is so Overrated.. at least for me.Rating- 6/10*",

            "content": "The reason I saw The Red Shoes was because I am a tremendous admirer of Martin Scorsese. His work, his outlook, his style, everything about the guy. One of the influences of his that he mentions the most is Michael Powell's work, especially The Red Shoes. I was surprised that I wasn't quite as moved as him. I've never been a fan of musicals, but there are always anomalies. However, I just felt indifferent towards it. One of the things about The Red Shoes that impressed me the most though was Anton Walbrook's performance as the dark, cocksure, self-sufficient producer Boris Lermontov, especially during his spiral into obsession and jealousy. Sharing the charm is beautiful Moira Shearer, whose dancing and increasingly dramatic time on screen become very interesting.As for Michael Powell, he certainly has fashioned himself a majestic, lavish, elegant production in prototype Technicolor. I find that as well as most of Powell's earlier movies, he collaborates with Emeric Pressburger. Perhaps he does the musical numbers and choreography and Powell directs the rest of the movie. Whichever way it goes, the turning- point musical number with the red shoes is easily the best scene in the whole film. It's a fantasy-themed, very extensive musical number that expands further than the stage that the characters are performing upon and is brought into a realm similar to dream sequence or hallucination, but in the lushest possible way.What I find creative is the movie's interpretation of Hans Christian Anderson's story, \"The Red Shoes,\" but what I also find creative about it is also what I find perhaps a bit hindering about it. It doesn't spend enough time on the themes of fantasy, magic, and dance. It spends more time on the process of producing an expensive, elegant theatrical production. Anyway, what it is is a musical that is different and more interesting story-wise than a lot of other more famous musicals of its time, and that's part of its charm.",

It is loved by the critics as a masterpiece of direction and performance. They slap each other on the back, and totally ignore some really bad howlers (called \"boners\" in the USA).For a start, how many pronunciations are there of \"Lermontov?\" I counted three. We have a old friend of Boris Lermontov calling him not Borya but Boris, and he stresses the first syllable. Some Russian is he! If these actors, were struggling with their Russian they need only have asked the Moscow-born Leonide Massine. This is just plain sloppy. Instead of being slapped on the back, these so-called actors should have been punched on the nose! In fact, Leonide Massine turns out the only decent acting performance. He is superb throughout.As to Moira Shearer. The Scottish ballerina is a superb dancer but a poor actress. She is supposed to be in emotional turmoil over whether to choose love or career. Instead, she might just as well be choosing whether to have porridge or rice crispies for breakfast.And all the marvellous trick photography of the dance sequences is totally undone by a glaring blunder like high fidelity reception of the BBC Third Programme in Monaco.If the British luvvies spent as much time perfecting their work as they do telling each other how marvellous they are, they might avoid ruining promising films like this.",

She is the aspiring ballet dancer \"Victoria\" who must train under the positively brutal rule of acclaimed tutor \"Lermontov\" (Anton Walbrook). This maestro, however, expects undiluted devotion and so when this young woman also falls in love - with composer \"Craster\" (Marius Goring) she finds herself out of favour. Facing the toughest of choices, she chooses love - but even married, she is still torn. When she returns a few years later to visit - her new husband having now completed the eponymous ballet - the imposing \"Lermontov\" proves he can still pull her strings and she faces an heart-rending choice. P&P have created a masterpiece of rich and colourful cinema. They have turned a relatively simple Hans Christian Anderson story into a maelstrom of love, ambition, power, control - you name it, it features here somewhere. Emotions run high, cruelty runs rife and all under the baton of Brian Easdale who has created his own \"Ballet of the Red Shoes\" score. Both Walbrook and Goring were underestimated actors, in my view. They had an adaptability that demonstrated a surety of foot as their characters illustrate traits that at best celebrate humanity, at worst denigrate it badly. The dancing is frequently mesmerising with the media of theatre and cinema merged seamlessly to give us a really breathtaking experience. I felt vested in the fate of this young woman, I felt vested in the nasty Lermontov - which would I have chosen? This is a great film, marrying the vivid imagination of a timeless creative source with a visionary and highly entertaining ensemble adaptation. Recently staged by the Sadler's Wells Company of Sir Matthew Bourne, but good as that was - this still knocked spots off it.",

Usually, though, I find the recommendations surprisingly good, especially in the case of older movies, because even just the directing and cinematography impress me enough to enjoy my time spent with it.The Red Shoes was another film I was hesitant to watch because I'm simply not terribly interested in the driving forces behind ballet. I find ballet to be pretty and I'm really impressed by the physicality of the dancers, but I couldn't care less about what's going on behind the curtain. But this time, instead of being just impressed with the overall craft of the film, I was blown completely away.Basically, I'd like to remove the first and second half of the film for an instant and comment upon the short film that exists literally in the very center of this film. The Archers, I've heard, grade their films by how close the arrow comes to the bullseye during their insignia at the beginning of the film, and whether that's true or just lore, I think they've nailed the exact center of their goal at the exact center of the film. It's during this part where the in-film production of \"The Red Shoes\" suddenly floats off the stage and becomes this streaming myriad of color, shape, form, light, shadows, and dance beyond anything I've ever seen created in a visual musical place before and sense. It's very easy to see why this film so impresses filmmakers, artists, and dancers that it is pretty difficult to concentrate on any of those aesthetics without hearing its name. It's also easy to see now why An American in Paris exists, and also why it fails.The performance, with all of its different aspects, was so powerful and effective that I had to watch it again after the film ended, and ended up watching it several times. It's one of those moments in cinema where one wonders, \"And there isn't more stuff like this out there WHY?!\" but knows immediately that the reason why is that it could have been done only once, only from creators like Emmerich and Pressburger, during only that moment in time when it was produced. It's a meteor shower among the stars, but it's lucky enough to stick around long enough in a close-to-permanent form to be accessed.And I believe that's enough flowery majestic language for it, because the key thing that makes the entire movie work so well is how much it works beyond language.

There's no way her husband will just swallow his pride and let her perform for a man he hates, and there's no way she can find fulfillment dancing for anyone else. In lesser hands, this would be a forgettable weeper, but paired with fine acting, direction, music, and color cinematography, it becomes a haunting fairy tale about art and death.Moira Shearer is heartbreaking as the ballerina torn between two incompatible lifestyles. She also possesses an atypical beauty that you never see much during the classic film era or even today. Anton Walbrook plays a rather unlikeable character, but by the end, you feel sorry for the guy and can even understand where he's coming from. Marius Goring's composer is both infuriating and pathetic.A gorgeous classic. I honestly feel it should have won Best Picture rather than Hamlet (1948).

Certainly, for highbrow spectators, THE RED SHOES is an absolute humdinger even it is just for its eponymous ballet piece, written by Brian Easdale, choreographed by Robert Helpmann and headlined by a virtuoso Moira Shearer, this Hans Christian Andersen inspired magic tragedy has been roundly integrated into the narrative, where a budding prima ballerina Vicky Page (Shearer) is torn by her hankering to play her bespoke showpiece and the secular love with Julian Craster (Goring), a promising composer, and the blockade is set by the ballet impresario Boris Lermontov (Walbrook), who has discovered Vicky in the first place, and loathes whoever dares to blemish the purity of devotion to art by falling into that profane thing called love, already he has instantly dismissed another ballerina Irina (Tch\u00e9rina) when she delightfully apprises the news that she is going to get married, so both Vicky and Julian should have known better.First of all, the ever-dapper Austrian actor Anton Walbrook effuses a superb air of condescension, complacency and cruelty that gives to the propulsion that the lax plot needs the most, calibrating every line and gesticulation with tacit investment of Boris' warped tunnel vision, he runs rings around his co-star Shearer and Goring as inhabiting \"the man with no heart\" with unyielding determination, he is at once obnoxious and fascinating. The fascination must be dialed down towards the ill-sorted pair, Ms. Shearer, is a fabulous dancer but not exactly what one might call as a supreme hyphenate, and even under the slap, furrows materializes on the face of Goring, who was 36 years old and looks like a doppelg\u00e4nger of Dirk Bogarde (who would be a perfect Julian at a tender age of 27) to this reviewer's eyes, then yet has to play a sapling, so it is somewhat grating to see he is constantly referred as a \"young man\" by Irina (Tch\u00e9rina is only 24), premature senility prevails, and that is not to say he is given much to do as the thankless fodder who bewitches Vicky into wedlock and cannot let her embrace the glory she yearns. Whereas viewers are showering in divine immersion of the most astonishing craftsmanship ever been executed on the screen, the discrepancy between its visual-and-aural extravaganza and a hoary, faintly incoherent (no effort is made to emphasize what the titular ballet means to Vicky, for instance) and evasive (unpunished plagiarism needs some scathing condemnation here) script only mars the ascension of THE RED SHOES as an irrefutable chef d'oeuvre that creates a harmonious symbiosis of cinema and ballet, and by the time they launch another attempt in THE TALES OF HOFFMANN (1951), the duo's mojo has drastically faded.",

Initially enthusiastic to be mentored by the great director, Page soon suffocates under his possessiveness, after he forbids her romance to the company composer, the pre-eminent Julian Craster (Goring). When Walbrook dismisses Goring after he fails to persuade him to end the romance, Shearer leaves the company in protest, but finds herself torn between two loves \u2013 that of the stage and the promise of greatness under Walbrook's watchful tutelage, and of her now husband Goring, himself on the verge of becoming a noted composer.This Powell-Pressburger collaboration of the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale is neither a fairy tale nor a ballet, in fact, it might draw parallels with the recent \"Black Swan\" in its contrasts of seemingly unbridled beauty and torrid sacrifice. Walbrook is a consummate performer, affecting a character whose capacity for praise and sympathy is concealed beneath a rigid, perfectionist exterior, bordering on megalomania. The scene in which his rage boils over and he strikes out at the mirror is impressive. Set design is, as perhaps you'd expect from the subject matter, exquisite in detail and the location work in Monte Carlo and Paris is divine.Without revealing the climax, I found it to be sudden and unexpected, reminiscent of a Hitchcock thriller in its method and impact. Probably not for all tastes, still I wouldn't suggest you'd need to be a connoisseur to appreciate the colour, romance, paranoia and suspense that is \"The Red Shoes\" which in spite of its vintage, remains a taut psychological drama/thriller.",

The Red Shoes is a very emotionless film, a film that revolves more around style and film techniques than story, a very sad fact as the film could have been one of the best ever if it had, had just a little more to do with the character's lives and emotions. I just didn't buy the predicament that Victoria Page (Moira Shearer) and the writer Julian Craster (Marius Goring) found themselves in; their love just didn't transfer well enough for me to feel that bothered at the end. The performances (with the exception of Anton Walbrook) where underwritten and not all that well performed, but if the film has a saving grace, then it has to be the dance of the red shoes sequence, if only the film had had more ballet in it I might have been able to give this film a higher vote, but alas no. This is the only real dance number in the film. That said it's still one of the greatest scenes I've ever seen, with Jack Cardiff's amazing use of colour and angles. Not a great film, but it has enough beauty in twenty minutes that some films lack in a two-hour running time, for that the film gets 7/10.",

I always thought it would be a bit too high brow for my tastes as I knew it was set amongst the world of ballet. I was pleased to find that I enjoyed the movie a lot and it was one of those films that stuck in my mind.The central plot revolves around three character's and it is at times a complex relationship between the three. For what it's worth,this is my take on what exactly drove those people to act in the way they did.Boris Lermontov - A man with a true love of ballet. Driven,obsessive,selfish and above all a perfectionist. Always well groomed and immaculately turned out,he wants nothing but the very best for his ballet company. He grooms Victoria Page and sees in her the potential to be the best dancer in the world. Does he love her? I think that he loves the idea of making her the best dancer that she possibly can be. He does have feelings for her and that is something he has never felt for any dancer before. But love? No,just a selfish desire to own her,to feel that she can't function without him.Julian Craster - Similar to Boris in some ways. He too is driven and selfish but the major difference is that he is truly in love with Victoria. He is jealous of his wife's feelings for Boris as he states \"You can dance anywhere but NOT here\" when she is in turmoil after returning to Boris' ballet company. He too wants to own her and although his motives are selfish he is deeply in love.Victoria Page - A complex lady. In love with Julian and Boris but perhaps more in love with dance that anything else in her life. She leaves Boris for her love of Julian but it is dance that drives her to her death. Does she return because of Boris or the ballet? A bit of both and when faced with the decision to choose between her husband or dance,she chooses ballet,at least at first. Does she mean to kill herself? Her mind is in turmoil as she spurns her husband. She doesn't want to lose him,she doesn't want to lose her life's ambition to be the best dancer she possibly could be. It is here that the Red Shoes take over and as she runs to her husband she is blind to the peril that faces her. Ultimately she is stuck in the middle of a love triangle with her husband on one side and Boris on the other. The Red Shoes decide her fate.This is a film that deserves it's status as a classic. Gorgeous to look at and well acted. Moira Shearer exudes charm as Victoria, Marius Goring hits just the right note as Julian and there are nice touches from Robert Helpmann(Ivan) and Leonide Massine(Grischa). It has to be said though that the most compelling performance comes from Anton Walbrook as Boris. Confident,arrogant,charming and aloof,this is a fine performance that stays in the memory. Don't be put off by the theme of this movie. It is very well made and well worth watching.",

            "content": "This was the first film from the Powell-Pressburger team that I saw, and, to use a phrase that was popular at the time (early '80's), it knocked my socks off. Recently, it was among a handful of DVD's I loaned to a friend who was housebound for a week recovering from minor surgery. When she said \"Oh, I've heard of this\" with some trepidation, I responded, \"It was sort of the MOULIN ROUGE of its day,\" knowing she was a fan of that movie. Though it really came off the top of my head, upon reflection I realized the comparison was apt.Though I can't say I was particularly impressed by MOULIN ROUGE, I have to give it credit for much of the same things I admire about THE RED SHOES.\" Both are innovative, and stretch the boundaries of film-making technology, narrative structure and visual design. They also have a thematic kinship, having to do with the conflict between love and career, which is symbolically expressed in a show-within-a-show.Here (with the possible exception of the effect on audiences of their respective periods), the similarities end. I bring them up only (as I did with my friend) as an incentive to those unfamiliar with THE RED SHOES (or Powell & Pressburger) who may not realize that work which seems so cutting-edge today is not all that new, and that there may be exciting viewing experiences in store for them from films made during an era to which they may not have given much consideration (or by which they may not have expected to be impressed).I'd also encourage any prospective viewers who might be put off by the \"balletic\" plot elements (\"Ballet? Yuk!\") to overcome such reservations. I can't imagine anyone who appreciates cinema craft at any level (and who isn't a complete Philistine) not uttering a quiet \"Wow!\" more than a few times during this picture.As with many Powell & Pressburger productions, THE RED SHOES is highly stylized at times and, despite comparisons made earlier here, a unique piece of film-making. All cinephiles owe themselves the opportunity to hop onto this magic carpet and be dazzled.",

            "content": "Viewed at the 2000 Karlovy Vary film festival.\nOne of the great revelations of the week in Karlovy was the rediscovery, in a section devoted to older classics, of the great English ballet drama \"The Red Shoes\", from the year 1948. I had seen the film years before and remembered that it had impressed me way back then, but I had forgotten, or perhaps hadn't realized at the time, how truly magnificent and extraordinary this incredible picture actually is.\nThe basic plot is a love triangle between a beautiful red headed ballerina, her despotic impresario, and a younger musician, set in an incredibly colorful Monte Carlo. Moira Shearer, an actual professional ballerina was the dancer, and most imposing as the possessed impresario, was Austrian actor Anton Walbrook. This picture, based to a certain extent on a Danish fairy tale by Hans Christian Anderson in which a dancer dons red shoes which make her into a marvelous dancer, but then won't let go and force her to dance herself to death, is the perfect merger of classic dance, high Greek tragedy, and Hollywood staging. Unquestionably one of the most beautiful and compelling motion pictures ever made. \n \n\"Red Shoes\" directed by the British masters Powell and Pressburger, is the kind of picture that makes sitting through a thousand other banalities worth while, and makes you remember why you fell in love with the flickers in the first place. I was most delighted to find that the film would be repeated, and put everything else on hold so I could see it again the next night. Had there been nothing else of note during the festival, RED SHOES would have been enough to justify the trip. It's just one of those movies that satisfies you to the core and leaves you ravished. Words fail. See it if you ever get a chance, preferably on the big screen",

            "content": "*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*\"The Red Shoes\" is the story of a woman who would like to live a life that is both professionally AND privately fulfilling - but the two men in her life (one personifying Love and Private Happiness, the other her professional passion, Dancing) do not permit her to incorporate both in her life. The conflict comes from the fact that neither man wants to recognize her as an artist and a personality in her own right, but rather as a vehicle of their own aspirations.During the budding romance with Craster, though, we see that her dream could be fulfilled: she dances to the music that he writes for her; both live a professionally and personally fulfilling life by cooperating. But Lermontov wants Vicky to be his creation and not to be attached to anyone or anything else except dancing. (It is obvious that he is not interested in her sexually or romantically - some said he might be gay, which can well be, but in the end, it doesn't matter, as Lermontov is rather the personification of his own ideal, a person only committed to his profession and to nothing and nobody else.)As the story develops, it turns out that to Craster, she is nothing more than an inspiration for his own work (he doesn't seem to bother that she is professionally unfulfilled while he reacts aggressively when she takes a step to dance again); to Lermontov, she is the clay she wants to form his own creation (a \"great dancer\") of. Though most supporting characters seem to recognize Vicky as an artist in her own right, the two men that matter most in her life do not. This is what leads ultimately to her downfall, as she is not able to choose between love and dancing, because both form a whole inside her. She rather sacrifices herself (though in the end it is not clear, to what extent) and thus affirms herself as a person and artist.A beautiful film (though not as supreme as I had expected it to be), with a great performance by Anton Walbrook and beautiful dancing scenes (though the not-so-perfect special effects in the otherwise highly original and captivating centerpiece were a bit disconcerting). I also like the passionate conflict of the story (the passion here is of the \"sublimated\" rather than of the downright erotic kind - it is very refreshing that the conflict between Vicky, Craster and Lermontov is not reduced to a mere love triangle). And, of course, a must for ballet lovers.",

I also liked the music, and the ballet sequence was inventively directed, but Walbrook & Goring played characters who were not likeable which failed to draw you in to a story which was too melodramatic for you to care about. I've enjoyed all the Powell/Pressburger films that I have seen up to now and I think they are one of cinema's greatest treasures, but this one failed to excite me. (5/10)",

Even though she made very few films, (she retired around 1960 to dedicate herself to raising her family), her presence was always wonderful. There's not much I have to say that other users have not said, except that the romantic triangle between a dancer, an impresario and a pianist really works, and is the heart of the movie. (Not being a ballet fan myself, the ballet part was less appealing to me, though it wasn't bothersome either). The color is wonderful, and allows us to see the world in 1948 as if it were today. Perhaps the scene that stands most of my mind is the first one, with all the young people struggling to enter into the theater. This recalls an era where young people love classical music, and would treat its performers as if they were stars. That era would end just a few years later, when rock and roll come to the fore, and the world would never be the same. Whether this change was for the good or for the bad, let others decide. I know this, my late father was a teenager in 1948, and he left a lot of classical recordings of that era that he collected during that time, the same way young people collected rock records decades later.",

            "content": "This is undeniably a film of extraordinary power by any genre's standards; it is also, I suggest, one of the most absorbing looks viewers have ever been granted on screen at the way in which artists--not hacks nor artists going about daily tasks but rather dedicated and even obsessed professional pursuers of the heightened-realism of beauty in the arts--risk themselves in pursuit of excellence. The high-energy level of the portrayal of ballet people is like the approach to a final dress rehearsal, not an ordinary day's work. The story-line concerns \"The Red Shoes\", a ballet suggested by a Hans Christan Anderson fairy tale about a young woman who dons lovely magic red foot-gear at the urging of her young man and of an evil wizard--supplying them to a shoemaker--and who then cannot remove them until she has danced herself to death. The same story-line is played out allegorically among three extraordinary talents--a brilliant young composer robbed of his work by a professor who is then commissioned to write \"The Red Shoes\" ballet music; his employer, an obsessive and dictatorial regisseur who runs his Lermontov Ballet Company with ruthless but perceptive perfectionist methods; and a lovely young, ambitious ballerina whom both love, who brings the ballet to the world's audiences. She goes off with the composer, deserting the ballet master after he has made possible her triumph in \"The Red Shoes\"; her fires the composer who succeeds on his ability. But half of what she wants in life is the perfection as an artist only he can drive her to. Faced with compelling and magnetic appeals and rewards offered by both those she admires and in her way loves, she kills herself, unable to choose between two courses that have unbalanced her mind. The film is another in the small but quite extraordinary series of works produced by Emmeric Pressburger and Michael Powell, which included \"The Black Narcissus\". The script was developed by Powell and Pressburger, with additional dialogue by Keith Winter and Marius Goring. The cinematography was done by the great Jack Cardiff, with production design by Hein Heckroth and art direction by Arthur Lawson. Brian Easdale and Kenny Baker are credited with the original music; Carven did the costumes. The \"Red Shoes\" ballet takes fifteen minutes, but most viewers seem to feel this centrally-placed art-work furthers the plot, as did the ballet in \"Oklahoma\" for instance. In the large cast, Ludmilla Tcherina is a quirky and moving grande dame of the dance, Robert Helpmann is powerful, Leonid Massine is as good as always, Moira Shearer is young and lovely as the young ballerina. But the film is dominated by Marius Goring's extraordinary young composer and Anton Wallbrook's award-level Boris Lermontov. The triangle these three bring to the screen is one of the most powerful ever realized on-screen, by my standards. The film is not as good in content as many believe because of its fatality aspects; but to overpraise its artistry--its presentation of visual beauty by suggestion and minimally-graphic assertion. This is a triumph for Jack Cardiff, for the audacious writer-producers and for British cinema in general, in my view. Comparing this film to ordinary story-lines is impossible; the theme of \"seeking the highest, risking all for the highest in art\" is not ordinary, but here is made central and necessary--and very memorable to an unforgettable achievement.",

            "content": "When you watch the film documentaries of Martin Scorsese and read the reviews and commentaries of Roger Ebert, you might hear of names such as Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger and their films The Black Narcissus and The Red Shoes. And when you regard Scorsese and Ebert and their knowledge of film as highly as I do, you take note of their recommendations. Both men, particularly Scorsese who was involved in the restoration of the film, speak very highly of The Red Shoes. Based on this alone, I was interested in watching the film. I did, however, wonder if its subject matter of ballet would interest me. When I finally started the film with mom last night, I enjoyed it, but I must confess, at first I wondered what the high praise was for. Then, fifty-seven minutes into the film, came the first performance of The Red Shoes. It grabbed me and refused to relent. I was even entranced by the dancing. I then understood the acclaim. I shall attempt to convey the wonder of this film, but first a little background information.The Red Shoes came out in 1948. Its story concerns a dancer, Victoria Page, and a composer, Julian Caster. Both are hired by world renowned ballet producer, Boris Lermontov, with the promise that he will make them great. But this comes with a price: their undivided devotion to their art, to their dream, and to him. The film is about the pursuit of art and dreams and what happens when this is taken to its extreme, to the point of obsession.The title refers to a fairy tale, by Hans Christian Anderson, that Lermontov is adapting into a ballet. The fairy tale is described by Lermontov like this: \"It is the story of a young girl who is devoured with an ambition to attend a dance in a pair of Red Shoes. She gets the shoes and goes to the dance. For a time, all goes well and she is very happy. At the end of the evening she is tired and wants to go home, but the Red Shoes are not tired. In fact, the Red Shoes are never tired. They dance her out into the street; they dance her over the mountains and valleys, through fields and forests, through night and day. Time rushes by, love rushes by, life rushes by, but the Red Shoes go on.\" Although I have never read Anderson's story, from this description alone, parallels can be seen throughout the film.Now, let's get back to fifty-seven minutes, the first performance of The Red Shoes. The film in general and this fifteen minute sequence specifically, is beautifully shot, seamlessly edited, and uses light and shadows to wondrous effect. Characters are transformed into other characters, a knife into tree branch. The red shoes are made to stand tip-toed on their own and the ballerina transported from standing by on stage to inhabiting them. A dancer morphs into a dancing newspaper and back again. Shadows grow larger and larger, taller and taller, threatening to attack the ballerina. But, alas, my words cannot do this film justice. Most viewers today, constantly inundated with CGI, would not be able to fully appreciate the brilliant artistry of all this. Again, this was 1948 when you actually had to be creative and achieve your effects in reality not with a computer. I found myself in awe of some of these shots, wondering how they were accomplished.The films color was also quite stunning for its time. Often the color in movies from this era look unnatural, but in The Red Shoes it is vibrant and full of life. I read that Technicolor considered this one of their best films. But I'm sure the quality of the picture is also due to the restoration process. As usual, Criterion did a marvelous job restoring and transferring the film to DVD. Although it was shot sixty-two years, it looks like it could have been made yesterday.Anymore, there seems to be a stigma on \"old\" movies. Do not let this or any preconceptions of the subject matter detract you from seeing The Red Shoes. It is a great film that will stay with you long after it has ended.Check out my other reviews at: notexactlyaquote.tumblr.com",

            "content": "\"The Red Shoes\" lets us see the fabulous technique of Moira Shearer's (Victoria page) classical dancing, and also the dated and slow-motion technique of Ludmilla Tcherina (Irina). Except for Leonide Massine, all of the male dancers in principal roles were pathetic. These are the \"stars\" who were left-over from \"Ballet Russe\" ? Male dancers in The USA were much better, even in those early days. \"Trivia\" tells us that even J. Arthur Rank (whose name the movie was released under) walked-out of the movie, thinking it was a dud. The whole production was almost shelved, with only a print released to a theater in New York City, where it played for 110 weeks. Universal Studios realized it was a masterpiece and released it nationwide.Many of the reviews posted here talk about the brilliance of the colors in the film. Doesn't anyone remember that \"Gone with the Wind\" was released IN COLOR at the beginning of the '40s? By the time \"Shoes\" was released, Hollywood had made many wonderful films in color by 1948 !! I guess younger \"users\" think that was in The Dark Ages. The cinematography certainly helped \"The Red Shoes\" become the hit it was and is.Moira Shearer's fabulous technique was apparent even in the rehearsal scenes for the new ballet - here was a major talent, over-shadowed by Margot Fonteyn. Both of them appeared in The Sadler Wells company, as soloists, at the same time. Scandals and gossip about that lady's romance with a certain Russian dancer helped to keep Ms. Shearer's superior technique in the background. However, she was a major dancer for years, but actually was not too anxious to dance in \"The Red Shoes\" - in which the fame for her dancing could not escape her and surely set an example for other ballerinas.This movie showed the backstage politics of ballet companies. Powell's script only had to be minimal, just to let the viewers see how a company worked, with small sub-plots to depict how a temperamental assembly of performers interacted. Pressberger's skill to get it all together was essential, a job well-done. The real star of the movie was Brian Easdale's score for \"The Red Shoes Ballet\" and Ms. Shearer's dancing.It's difficult to realize that Russian audiences could attend the theater for pennies for decades, while the art had barely caught-on in this country. Now, major ballet-companies are struggling to stay onstage, even the Russians having financial problems. I clearly remember rehearsal-halls being built in a famously old theater in Los Angeles for a major company, who got cold feet after the riots in the early 1990s. I understand Los Angeles ain't \"The Big Apple\", but that theater has turned into a major venue for rock-stars and bands, because it's big enough to make money, but small enough for them to play a more intimate venue to get close to their fans. The seats on the bottom floor were removed and a dance-floor put in, and it's rocking........it also can be set with tables and chairs for more romantic acts. The Wiltern is always busy.The actual \"Red Shoes Ballet\" in the movie is a miraculous piece of work. Nothing was spared to present its fairytale to let every viewer escape into its magic, getting actually involved from all sides, not just looking at it from the front. Anton Walbrook (Lermontov) was brilliant in his role - the perfect dictator of a talent-driven company. His acting was totally believable. All the supporting actors-actresses were superb, with the plot being about ballet - period. I wasn't impressed with Marius Goring's (Craster) role, because he wasn't nearly handsome enough for the gorgeous Ms. Shearer - he needed to be dashing and full of fire. That her character gave-up her career to be the wilting wife was a stretch for me, because her whole life was about dancing.The tireless red shoes that refused to stop dancing drove the plot of the entire movie - and provided a tragic, fairytale ending. One viewing of this masterpiece is not enough - although the movie is older that most of the people seeing it today - except me - it is ageless. Give yourself a treat that you'll never regret - buy this DVD or VHS to watch when you need inspiration. I'm sure you'll rate it a 15, just as I did.....1/23/08 - just lucked-up on TCM/s presentation of this brilliant film last night. The print was fabulous, apparently transferred to DVD - so thankful to see it was done in it's original, full-screen version: wide-screen would have cut all the heads off. If you haven't seen it yet, search for it - it's still a thriller.",

            "content": "In an era where nothing is sacred and corporate profits supercede personal worth, watching a movie as beautifully created and finely acted as this helps us remember how much beauty there really is around us.Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Red Shoes\" - a moral tale about a mischievous shoemaker who tempts a young girl or boy into buying the beautiful shoes, only to discover that they cause him/her to dance restlessly until he/she dies - is the metaphor central to this movie and plays itself out both in the movie's ballet masterpiece and the lives of the characters.The ballet company producer is a tortured and possessive man who wants to own the prima donna of the story in the same way that incomplete people want to own and absorb the beauty of something or someone else. But an off-stage romance between the leading lady and the genial composer leads to a rivalry of ownership and a seminal final scene where the Moira Shearer character is forced to choose between her husband or her dancing career.I gather this was a highly political movie of its time. Made in the years shortly after the war, it was probably an attempt by the British film-makers to make sense of the war's madness; this probably accounts for the looming Lermontov's possessiveness and ultimate destructiveness.However, not only the movie's plot line and beautiful direction appeals. Also, the moments when the movie depicts 1948 street life have an amazing effect on you. Seeing steam-trains and pleated summer dresses and reflections of a more innocent age all contribute to the movie's beauty and appeal.",

This wonderful movie uses the tale as the beginning of a tragedy for a young ballerina who has to choose between her love of dancing, and the love of her boyfriend.The acting by the entire cast is brilliant. I watched this on DVD, and it revealed that the majority of the cast were actual ballet dancers that had to act, not the other way round as would be normal. The result of this is that the acting side does have the occasional flaw (as for most it would be their first acting experience), but it makes all the dancing and behind the scenes action almost real.As I said most of the actors were real dancers, but special credit has to go to Moira Shearer. Already established as a ballerina, she does very well in her performance of the girl torn in two. The acting star of the movie though is Anton Walbrook. His performance as Lermontov, the owner of the ballet company is sensational. At times brutal, others almost compassionate, his performance dominates the movie. Watch his last speech in the movie for proof of this.The real stars of this movie are Micheal Powell & Emeric Pressburger. They'd already made several classics, such as A Matter Of Life And Death (a personal fav. of mine), and Black Narcissus. This easily sits alongside those movies. Also deserving special mention is Jack Cardiff's stunning photography, and the production design by Hein Heckroth. More of an artist, his sets and imagination shine through, especially with the stunning 17 minute ballet sequence in the middle of the movie. This scene, the ballet version of the red shoes story, easily sits up there as one of the best dance sequences ever put to film...and I never thought I'd say that as I'm not a ballet fan, but the scene is extraordinary. This sequence at times shows more imagination and originality than some newer movies do. And the effects used, though dated by todays standards still hold up well.I'm not sure I'd go so far as to call it a musical, more a romantic drama set in a ballet company, but whatever you wish to class it as, it deserves to be seen.",

With an initial rentals gross of over $5 million, number 1 at the U.S./Canadian box-office for 1948, easily beating off challenges from Road to Rio, The Paleface, Easter Parade and Red River, each of whom grossed $4.5 million. Oddly, this superb result was not duplicated in the U.K. itself. The film did manage to claim the number 10 position, but it was beaten by British picture- goers' far greater preferences for (in order) Spring in Park Lane, The Best Years of Our Lives, My Brother Jonathan, The Road to Rio, Life with Father, It Always Rains on Sunday, Naked City, Oliver Twist, and Unconquered. Second to The Paleface at Australian ticket windows for 1949. Number 1 English-language movie at the French box-office. Number two in the 1949 Film Daily poll of American film critics. A New York Times \"Ten Best\" for 1948. Film debut of Moira Shearer.COMMENT: A marvelously entertaining movie which succeeds brilliantly \u2014 against the odds. The idea of planning the ballet in advance (see Jean Osborne's review below) sounds crackpot to me, but it works. And it just doesn't come off reasonably well, but with power and certitude. Also none too promising were such old hat plot stratagems as a Diaghilev impresario thwarting young love (cf. Waterloo Bridge) and a composer whose music is stolen (cf. the Claude Rains Phantom of the Opera). But thanks partly to absolutely riveting performances; partly to a script crowded with realistically drawn characters, given some wonderfully caustic dialogue, and jam-packed with fascinating incidental touches; partly to masterful direction; partly to evocative music and appealing dancing; partly to superb color in sets and costumes, beguiling outdoor locations and breathtaking production values, The Red Shoes is a masterpiece of absolutely engrossing entertainment. Hard to believe it runs 133 minutes. Seems more like 33.Needless to say the mysticism and religiosity of Andersen's tale has been completely expunged from the main story, though these elements are still reflected in the ballet.",

We see spellings like Grischa Ljubov and Ivan Boleslawsky. It appears that someone tried to mix English transliterations of Russian names with German transliterations. Proper English ones would be Grisha Lyubov and Ivan Boleslavsky, while proper German ones would be Grischa Ljubow and Iwan Boleslawski. It proliferates even further once you get to French and Italian transliterations (don't even get me started on Czech and Polish).OK, that was tangential. My point is that while one can admire the dancers' passion with their work, you're likely to find the movie's pompous, heavy-handed seriousness a little corny, and some of the sequences will leave you thinking \"I want some of what they're smoking!\" Still, Moira Shearer is definitely a real babe in this movie.",

            "content": "The question isn't whether The Red Shoes is the best movie of all time-- it belongs in the discussion-- but whether it's the greatest work of art, period.Its famed centerpiece, The Red Shoes ballet, alone qualifies it for such consideration. Never has there been such full display of visual and aural art-- the music, sets, and costumes are a culmination of modernist art up to that point in time (1948). Surreal and expressionist, with touches of jazz and Dada. This, accompanied by inspired dancing from world-class ballerina Moira Shearer and others, and shot in phenomenal three-strip Technicolor.The experience is like walking through the most vibrant art museum imaginable.The film is more than the set-piece ballet, of course. It's the ultimate depiction of the creation of art. As a character says, of \"something from nothing.\" A must-see for anyone who aspires to create-- for the ideals expressed in the film as well as the created film: the structure holding the ideals and ideas in place. Plot threads overlap then come together. Notice how the featured ballet is set up, backstage flurries, worries, and nerves, and expectant audience, the building of suspense, so we the viewers of the movie are as filled with anticipation and tension as the dancers themselves.(Films used to regularly set up their most thrilling sequences, instead of throwing them at the audience non-stop. The 1959 version of Ben-Hur for instance, does this with its justly famous chariot race.)One could write volumes about everything going on psychologically in The Red Shoes. One of them is impresario Boris Lermontov as all-controlling artistic god. This shown from the beginning when he's unseen behind a curtain while his ballet company frolics on stage-- seeming from a distance like puppets. Like a wrathful god, Lermontov also displays anger when two of his puppets later disobey him.Or: the male gaze, when Lermontov in the audience views fledgling star Victoria Page dancing with a local theater company-- and she realizes he's there.The restored-version DVD from the Criterion Collection is the next best thing to seeing The Red Shoes on film in a movie theater.A perfect work of art? Maybe, despite the melodramatic-but-inevitable ending. All elements of cinema work together flawlessly-- acting (special nods to Anton Walbrook and Ms. Shearer), the Brian Easdale score, cinematography, script, direction: everything.",

            "content": "Art films are rarely successful interpretations relying more on arts for arts sake than to carry through a complete story through development to conclusion. The Red Shoes is an ballet art film and it is a successful dramatic film which excels in telling the story of a lovely young dancer who must decide between her desire to dance or to live as the wife of a composer. Moria Scherer is the lovely ballet dancer who is placed in the cross hairs of a powerful impresario, Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) who is both mentor and obsessive that his principal dancer remain faithful only to the company and his direction. As she tries to make her way in the company, she is plucked from the chorus by Lermontov to dance the principal lead in the new ballet, \"The Red Shoes.\" To familiarize her with the music, Lermontov asks his assistant conductor, Julian Krasner (Marius Goring) to play for her during her off-stage as well as on-stage moments. Throwing the two young rising stars together, Lermontov accidentally set the scene for their falling in love, a situation that is intolerable for the jealous, controlling director.A cinematic high point of the film is the 20 minute ballet of the Red Shoes, which for students and lovers of the ballet is one of the great treats of dance film history. Incorporating the stylized ballet of the 40s, it is a window into the formal method of partnering and choreography which was the European style of ballet and staging familiar to European audiences, but rarely seen in the U.S. Incorporating a surrealistic look, the ballet foreshadows the dilemma which the young Vickie is soon to experience herself with disastrous results. Other snips from the classical repertoire featured in the film include Copellia, rarely danced today, Ballet Fantastique, Les Sylphide, and Swan Lake. One dancer who appears in the film from the noteworthy companies of the period is the brilliant choreographer and dancer, Leonide Massine, who as Grecia Lubov, recreates several of the leading roles from his own stellar career in Russia and Europe.This is a film made for color with shocking use of vibrant reds and blues which literally stun the eye. Shot on location in Monte Carlo and London, the film reflects the plush settings of the great resort lifestyle with its opulence and grandeur. If films of art, music, and fantasy are your cup of tea, The Red Shoes is the film to watch. It is a visual exultation of music and ballet through the work of a great production team of Pressburger and Powell, and is a film never to be forgotten.",

The film is about a young ambitious female dancer Vicki, who joins a ballet company directed by an authoritarian impresario, Lermontov. Vicki's first performances of 'The Red Shoes' have brought her fame and fortune, and her romantic relationship with a younger composer Julain Craster develops; however, Lermontov's discovery of Vicki's romance with Julian leads to his rage, and results in both Vicki and Julian leaving the company. Lermontov's curt demeanour, and demands for obedience puzzle Vicki. Vicki's quandary in choosing between her romance and life as a prima ballerina leads to tragedy.The compelling cinematography, riveting and atmospheric music, the thrilling dichotomy in Vicki's are the elements in which mark this film as one of the classics of all time. Three art forms, dance, music and film are intertwined skilfully in The Red Shoes. Powell Pressburger team provides the audience enigmatic experience throughout the film with the use of mystifying lighting, compositions, and character development. The scene where Lermontov in his sombre room breaks the mirror with his fists, symbolizes and signposts the upcoming tragedy which is looming towards the end of this film. 17 minutes sequence of the ballet scene makes this film grand-breaking and exemplary to other films in the decades to come. Surreal elements in the scenes of The Red Shoes create parallels with Vicki's life as a lover and ballet dancer.",

I will leave a detailed analysis of the film to other viewers who know its history. I'll just say that the staging of the actual ballet of  \u0091The Red Shoes' is brilliant. Powell and Pressberger have managed to take you into the subjective world of the dancers while keeping them on the stage. It is perhaps the finest cinematic representation of art's magical ability to transport the artist into another world. One note on the Criterion DVD transfer: while the color saturation is good, there seems to have been a problem with the timing. You can watch an actor's flesh tones change several times in the course of a few seconds (which is a little distracting). Given the great quality of Criterion's other transfers, I can only assume that this is a problem with the source material. The audio quality also suffers by comparison to modern standards.\nBut my complaints about the transfer do not diminish the accomplishments of Powell and Pressberger in turning the story of \u0091The Red Shoes' into a great ballet and a haunting metaphor about art, artists and sacrifice.",

            "content": "Over the last month,I have unexpectedly been drawn to watching films that have ballet dancing as a main theme to the plot.Soon after I had ordered Suspiria and Black Swan,I began to hear about a film which is meant to be the main inspiration for all future ballet films.Searching round for information about the film,I was thrilled to find out that it had been made by Michael Powell and Emeric Preesburger,whose stunning work I had just recently in the sadly forgotten film Gone To Earth. With having read the huge amount of praise that this particular film of theirs has received,and also having been hugely entertained by Gone To Earth,I started to get myself ready, for something very special which I was about to see..The plot:For Victoria Page dancing has been something thats been in her veins since the very beginning of her life.With having spent most of her young adult life taking part in small,independent ballet productions.Thinking that she is never going to reach the top in her career,Victoria is left speechless when her aunt,tells her that she has sorted out an opportunity for Page to meet one of the worlds most successful ballet producer's:Boris Lermontov.At the after-show celebration of Lermontovs latest production,Victorias aunt goes up to Boris to ask him if her niece Victoria could do an audition for him.Being left almost speechless,due to a \"nobody\" thinking that they are worthy to even attempt to get a role in his production,Lermontov instantly leaves the party.Despite Borises signs of obvious anger towards them,Victoria keeps trying to get him to watch an audition of her's.Realising that Lermontov is never going to give her opportunity she so desires,Page instead decides that she will stick to doing local ballet performance,although Victoria is completely unaware that Boris has accepted an invitation to go and watch the \"small\" ballet show,which she has a lead part in.. With at last having (actidentally) seen Victoria perform,Lermontov rushes up to tell her that her ballet perform is \"the most pure and beautiful\" that he has ever seen.Having now become very impressed with her performance,Boris finally gives Victoria Page the offer her whole life has been building up to:being in a Lermontov production.Shortly after Victoria signs the contract,Boris gives her the opportunity of having the lead role in his next production,due to his main dancer having been fried for getting married.After accepting the offer,Boris tells her that there is one rule that he has,which she and everyone else has to follow,which is to never fall in love,due to Lermontov feeling that it completely ruins the performance of the show.Shortly after having signed Victoria,a young wannabe composer called Julian Craster runs into Lermontovs office,demanding that he be given the chance to play some of the music he has recently been writing.Feeling intrigued by the brash confidence that Craster has shown him,Boris accepts Jullians offer.Due to having caught a glimpse of Craters talent,Lermontov decides to hire Julian as his main composer,and instantly gives him the huge challenge of writing the next production.To his amazement,Julian writes the next production (The Red Shoes) in record time.On the opening night,Lermontov is thrilled when everyone tells him that this is one of the best ballets that they have ever seen.At the after show party,he looks round for Victoria and Craster without any luck at all.Suddenly,someone that has worked backstage on The Red Shoes tells Boris that the reason he can not find either of them,is because they have both gone to take a ride in a horse and carriage,due to having fallen deeply in love for each other... View on the film:The first thing which I feel this truly beautiful film should be praised for,is the astonishing,twenty minute long performance of The Red Shoes ballet.For this twenty minute sequence Producers/screenwriters (along with Keith Winter) and co-directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger create,what is possibly the nearest I have ever seen a film come to showing an actually dream!.The sequence cleverly mixes the theatre setting of the film,with the stunning filming technique of Powell and Pressburger,who with some well timed sudden jump-cuts,120 brilliant paintings by the under rated Hein Heckroth and some very tough looking wire work for the dancers,that help to give a strange gravity-defying feel to the sequence.Whilst most film makers would perhaps just let one sequence in their film be the main thing that blows everyone away,here Powell and Pressburger show that there is no chance at all,that they will let any moment of the film just be \"ok\".For the great screenplay,which they co-wrote with Keith Winter,Powell and Pressburger very elegantly balance the script,so that there are quite a few funny moments early on in the film with Boris Lermontov (terrificly played by Anton Walbrook),whilst they make sure that Victoria Pages never ending desire to dance is the main foundation for the films plot,with her first attempts to get a role in Lermontovs productions being shown in a slight comedic light,and then gradually changed,into showing her addiction to ballet dancing consuming entire soul.After having immensely enjoyed Moira Shearers performance of Victoria Page,I went searching online to try and find out some more information about her,Which eventually led to me discovering the complete surprise that Shearer was not keen on the film at all,and although I can understand the reasons why Moria disliked making the film so much.(mainly due to the intense amount of dancing and wire work which she had to do) I strongly feel that her performance is truly mesmerising,with the scenes where Victoria feels the pain of her addiction to ballet,that has caused her to lose everything else around her being painful to watch,thanks to Morias very intense performance. Final view on the film:One of the greatest,most beautifully perfect films that I have ever seen.",

The whirlwind drama created by commanding auteur Boris Lermontov builds slowly and gradually, increasingly dramatic pace and tension culminating with the performance of the Red Shoes.Here we are shown the truly graphic nature of the musical imagery Craster (it's composer) describes earlier, the dance, fabulous by itself is supported by visual and musical invention that transcribes the ballet and the role of the dancer. She becomes intertwined with the art itself until glimpses of Craster and Lermontov intervene and we are returned to mere theatre. It is here where my reservations begin. Somehow, during the performance, Lermontov has been transformed. From a remote but vital creator surrounded by a bunch of supportive, equally creative adjutants where his work is everything, he is reduced to a love-sick puppy blinded to his ambitions by an overwhelming physical love for one woman. This to my mind is just too big a fish to swallow.Circumstances dictate that he never has the opportunity to declare this love, but instead hides his emotions behind his previous persona, before setting in train a chain of events that lead to the films shocking but inevitable climax. Unfortunately, though it is dramatic, it's also a bit of an anti-climax, whereas the death of Lermontov in some equally dramatic fashion would have given a much more satisfactory conclusion to the whole endeavour. Whatever, don't be put off by my musings, if you love film, you must watch this.",

            "content": "Cited by many directors and critics as one of the greatest films ever made, The Red Shoes was recently remastered under the care of Martin Scorsese. Directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, whilst having made many truly brilliant films, are still not held in a high enough regard. Their films were always awash with Technicolor masterstrokes, and their is no finer example of it than in this film. I truly believe that this is the most beautiful film ever made, and that you could freeze frame any second and hold it up as a work of art.Telling a story within a story, The Red Shoes focuses on two young, aspiring artists - one is Vicky Paige (Moira Shearer), a beautiful young ballet dancer who makes an impression on ruthless producer Boris Lermonotov (Anton Walbrook). When he asks her the ultimate question - why do you want to dance? - she instantly responds 'why do you want to live?'. The second is Julian Craster (Marius Goring), an ambitious and talented composer whose ability to create great scores gains him the honour of re-writing the score for a new production of Hans Christian Andersen fairytale The Red Shoes. Vicky is cast as the lead, playing a girl seduced by a pair of red shoes that will not stop dancing as much as she tries to stop. Vicky and Julian work closely together, and then inevitably fall in love, much to the jealousy and rage of Lermonotov.What stuck in mind the most about the film was the fact that my eyes were never allowed to rest as the film progressed. Even during the solemn moments, I found my brain struggling to absorb all the visual magic on display. As the camera pans through a busy rehearsal session, the frame is full of moving characters, colourful costumes, highly detailed sets and complex mise-en-scene. Legendary cinematographer Jack Cardiff, who worked on The African Queen, as well as Powell/Pressbuger masterpieces Black Narcissus and A Matter Of Life And Death, deserves every award available for his work here. The centrepiece performance of The Red Shoes which lasts for around 15 minutes, is as imaginative and as breathtaking a set-piece as in any film I've ever seen. Cardiff was given an Honorary Oscar in 2001 for his contribution to cinema.Not to say the rest of the film is lacking. Pressburger's original script includes some fantastic lines. The complexity of Lermonotov's jealousy and anger when Vicky leaves the stage to be with her love is summed up in a great scene - Lermonotov and Julian stand in Vicky's dressing room, as Vicky is torn between her love of dance and to her husband. Julian simply accuses 'you're jealous of her', to which Lermonotov replies 'yes, I am. But in a way you'll never understand.' It's brilliance lies in it's simplicity.The Red Shoes' legacy is it's influences of many filmmakers and cinematographers, cementing it's place as one of the greatest films of all time, and the pinnacle of the body of work produced by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. The film was practically remade recently with Black Swan, which shared much of the films style and plot, but little of its intrigue and importance.

Technicolor never looked better then it did here. The sets and costumes are gorgeous and fully taken advantage of by the directors. The performance of \"The Red Shoes\" which serves as a centerpiece to the film is simply one of the most impressive sequences I've ever seen. This movie also has one of my favorite cuts of all time. After announcing she is engaged to the company, a dancer notices Boris has left and says to herself he is a cruel man. We then cut to a wide shot of Boris alone in a large dark room, framed by a moonlit window. It is a stunning moment to behold. The performances are for the most part subdued and cold,but match the tone and subject of the text enough that they are not a distraction. I particularly thought Walbrook, who played the producer, nailed a few of his more difficult scenes. The only real problem I had with the script was the ending, which felt forced and not truthful to the character of Victoria. Definitely a must for any die hard fans of lavish technicolor productions.",

            "content": "The ballet in this movie is better than \"An American in Paris\". This one inspired my lifelong participation in dance. American in Paris did not come out until later, and perhaps was a copycat in retrospect. Oh, \"The Red Shoes\" is absolutely the best. I still love Gene Kelly, but Moira Shearer in this movie is better than anybody. Even in American in Paris, the ballet clothing worn by Leslie Caron is a little too risqu\u00e9 and revealing for children to watch.I first saw \"The Red Shoes\" as a child, and immediately begged my mother to give me ballet lessons, which she promptly did.Kudos, forever, to Moira Shearer, from an ex-little girl fan in America. Hugs to her. 15/10.P.S. Sad update: On January 30, 2006, Moira Shearer passed away. \"The Red Shoes\" has died. I had surgery that day; biopsy for breast cancer. Thankfully, the results were negative. In 1998, I had a similar surgery, with malignant results, and an ensuing mastectomy and chemotherapy. This year, however, I am so thankful my life was spared again. I cried and cried when I heard Moira Shearer had passed away. She did a great deal to cheer me up in my life, and I will always be indebted to her. I just happen to have \"The Red Shoes\" movie on tape, thankfully. Today is June 11, 2006. :)Update July 3, 2014: Still one of the most spectacular films of all time, dance or otherwise. Lermontov came off as extremely evil, yet tender in his love(s) for ballet and Victoria Page. IRL there were other exceedingly possessive impresarios, for example Charles Frohman and the great diva actress Maude Adams. IRL Frohman died in tragedy, not his prot\u00e9g\u00e9.I watch The Red Shoes again and again. I keep looking for red regular street shoes in the store. I like to drive a red car. I like pink and purple in my color choices, but red is always my number one favorite color of all time.I marvel at the real-life ballet legends in this movie; famous names. Leonide Massine, Robert Helpmann, Ludmila Tcherina -- not to mention that young newcomer Moira Shearer.Observations: Moira dancing with the newspaper predated (by two years) the newspaper dance done by Gene Kelly in 1950's Summer Stock (Judy Garland movie). Boronskaja and Page (Ludmila and Shearer) tried to give up their ballet careers for marriage, but in today's dance world may have made the career number one -- and the husband may have had to wait at least until the ballerina had hit retirement age. I sometimes FF the student-early-show part of the movie; it can seem long and boring. That dastardly professor who stole Julian's musical composition -- what an idiot. I liked Victoria Page's aunt, Lady Neston. She had tricks up her sleeve, and Lermontov was on to her. Vicky wasn't exactly innocent in the deal, either. I guess she put Boris in his place when she asked him if he wanted to live.Update December 2018: More reflections. Shoemaker scary and evil. Red shoes beautiful. Stunning. Moira magnificent. A classic.20/10 :) :)",

            "content": "Okay,I admit it...I'm not the biggest ballet person (although I can respect it as an art form). However,this did not sway me one bit from enjoying 'The Red Shoes',one bit. The story concerns a young,up & coming ballerina,Victoria Page (played by Moira Shearer),who wants nothing more than to dance in the legendary Lermontov dance company. When good fortune drops in her lap,she joins the company. She has to win the admiration of it's founder,Boris Lermontov (played to the nine's by Anton Walbrook),who is shrewd,controlling,calculating,but wants nothing more than to have the best dance company in all of Europe. When a young English composer,Julian Craster (Marius Goring) becomes the new conductor/music arranger/composer of the company,potential romantic sparks fly between him & Victoria,much to the chagrin of Boris,who also has an eye for pretty,young Victoria. All of this makes for splendid drama. One of the high points of the film is a ballet rendition of Hans Christian Anderson's fairy tale,The Red Shoes,with an original musical score by Craster. All of this makes for a beautifully filmed event (shot in the old I.B. non fading Technicolor process by Jack Cardiff),with superb editing by Reginald Mills. The production design,by Hein Heckroth & art direction by Arthur Lawison conjures up a dreamy,surreal look to it (especially during the Red Shoes ballet sequence,that reminds one of some of the films of Jean Cocteau,at times). The rest of the cast turn in bravura roles. Michael Powell & Emeric Pressburger co direct from a screenplay written by Pressburger & Keith Winter. What I really admired is that this film reminded me of another film from the same era (Childern Of Paradise),which concerned people in the performing arts,their lives & loves,and the sacrifices they make for their art. Perfect film entertainment for the whole family. Currently making the rounds in a superb,brand spanking new 35mm print,with restored Techicolor (overseen by Martin Scorsese,and others)on the revival/art house circuit. Not rated by the MPAA,but contains absolutely nothing to offend",

            "content": "Between 1946 and 1948 the film-making team of Michael Powell and EmericPressburger produced, in quick succession, three of the greatest British films ever made: A Matter of Life and Death, Black Narcissus and this, arguably their masterpiece in a career studded with masterpieces. The Red Shoes follows the careers of two young artists as they join theprestigious Ballet Lermontov. Vicky is a beautiful, red-headed ballerina, Julian a gifted composer. The two are brought together by the impresario BaronLermontov, who rules over his company with a combination of ruthlessdiscipline and suave charm. The Baron's arrogance and intensity are matchedonly by his genius for assembling talent \u0096 Vicky and Julian join a team thatincludes flamboyant principal dancer Grischa, kindly set designer Ratov andeccentric conductor Livy. The whole team is brought together in Monte Carlo to begin work on the company's new project: a ballet based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale of \u0091The Red Shoes'. Vicky is plucked from the corps to dance the lead and Julian produces an entirely new score. As the pair are drawncloser by intense rehearsals, Lermontov's initially paternal gaze curdles into vicious jealousy\u0085 This is a film that thrills and delights on every level. From Jack Cardiff'sgorgeous Technicolour photography and Brian Easedale's strikingly modernistscore to Hein Heckroth's exquisite production design, every aspect of the film achieves nothing less than perfection. Performances \u0096 and remember that three of the main characters, Helpmann, Massine and Tch\u00e9rina were not actors butprofessional ballet dancers \u0096 are uniformly excellent. The 15-minute dancesequence \u0096 in which the viewer is taken literally \u0091into' the world of the Red Shoes \u0096 is justly famous, a swirling assembly of colour, sound and image that has never been equalled.Of special note is the writing: Pressburger, a Hungarian immigrant to England, wrote delicious dialogue for his largely upper class characters. Here \u0096 as in \u0091The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp' \u0096 he sees the English as only an outsider can, sketching the characters with rare affection and insight. This applies not only to the two, English leads, but also to the Eastern European Baron, whose devastating wit is exhibited like a slender epee in more than one scene. Indeed, even the minor characters are etched out like tiny, perfect miniatures by their gleaming dialogue.  Powell and Pressburger brought to the screen some of the most dazzlingdisplays of visual ingenuity ever created. The Red Shoes is their highestachievement, their gift to the cinema-going universe.",

The two men who love her are very cruel towards her and everyone else around her. And their loves for her seem to only exist so that the plot will advance.

            "content": "Overlong, overly melodramatic and weighed down by a silly plot, \"The Red Shoes\" is nevertheless some kind of masterpiece, thanks largely to some strong photography by directors Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell. Filmed in glorious Technicolor, this is a film of deep blacks, luscious reds, ghostly whites, some fine sets, scrumptious lighting, an audacious 17 minute ballet sequence and a number of experimental, camera tricks.The plot? Moira Shearer plays Vicky, a ballet dancer who's torn between impresario Boris Lermontov and composer Julian Craster. Boris, almost ascetic in his obsession with art, sees artists as creatures who must repress love and emotions in favour for some larger, almost spiritual goal; the body must suffer, must renounce worldly pleasures, for art's sake. Julian, meanwhile, is a more fickle creature, acting on his whims and wildly expressive of his love for Vicky. Boris loves Vicky too, but it's an aloof, ornamental love. He wants to possess Vicky as a work of art to be sculpted, controlled and presented to audiences. Julian's different; he loves Vicky as lovers do.Torn between these two impulses, Vicky eventually catapults herself over a ledge and onto a train track. Dying, she whispers: \"take off the red shoes.\" Of the film, Powell would say: \"We had all been told for ten years to go out and die for freedom and democracy, but now that the war was over, 'The Red Shoes' told us to go and die for art.\" But does the film really say that? Is Vicky's death really emblematic of an artist dying for her art? Not really. Vicky is asked to choose between romantic love and artistic expression, but only in a very vague way (and Julian, who she chooses, is still an artist). The film's more about men in power engaging in petty games for petty reasons. Less a glorification of dedicated artists, the film's more a chastisement of egotistical artists. Indeed, its message seems to be the opposite of what Powell offers: no work of art is worth causing suffering, abuse or another's life.Regardless, the film contains a number of excellent sequences in which a ballet within the film (\"The Red Shoes\", based upon a fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen) echoes in sophisticated ways the drama of the film. Elsewhere Powell and Pressburger delve into the behind-the-scenes, preparatory work which goes into a major ballet production. They see the spectacle of ballet as an analogue for the film experience, both endeavours requiring much elbow grease and collaboration. The film would be parodied with Paul Verhoeven's \"Showgirls\".\"The Red Shoes\" was once idolised by a whole generation of young film-makers, particularly Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Ken Russell and Brian De Palma. Scorsese has tried numerous times to emulate the lush tones of Powell and Pressburger. Most recently he's failed to do this with \"Shutter Island\", but over a decade earlier captured their qualities remarkably well with both \"Kundun\" and \"The Age of Innocence\". De Palma's \"Phanton of the Paradise\" shows hints of Pressburger as well. Incidentally, \"The Red Shoes\" is oft compared to Pressburger's \"Black Narcissus\", a more interesting, though equally luxuriant looking film.8/10 \u2013 Worth one viewing.",

Moira shearer is the striking centre of attention in the film, and she does hold the film together. The ballet sequences whilst polished, do suffer from the lack of more daring moves modern dance could achieve. The acting is too mannered except for Moira shearers, though for the story to work you really have to believe Moira shearer could be interested in Leodentev as a mentor. He is such a cold fish, that to return to him, even with the promise of dancing 'the red shoes' is difficult to believe. Her other admirer; Marius Goring is not much more interesting either. To throw herself to her death in front of a strangely on time train for either of them doesn't seem credible. I think there could have been a brilliant film here, but the acting is too staged, and the characters too uninspiring to make an exploration of passion in art, as opposed to passion in real life work. I did stay the course of the film, but it doesn't have the feel of a great film for me. I would recommend reading Ken Russell's 'fire over England' which does a typically overstated but very interesting examination of 'the red shoes'",

All of the dancers are straight and date the ballerinas, the prima ballerina dances in fantastic locations like Monte Carlo, London and Paris. Is this what the life of ballet was like in Europe in the late forties? Probably not, but certainly the image that they wanted out to their audience both in 1948 and 2007.

That's pretty cool to know, but like 2010's Black Swan, the movie makes anybody that takes ballet, a tragedy figure. This also, might be hard to believe, but famous director known for gangster films, Martin Scorsese loves this movie so much. He loves it so much, that help with the film restoration of the film to get it back to what it look like in 1948. Like the Dutch fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen, 'The Red Shoes' is about a woman who cannot stop dancing. I was intrigued by the obsession of the character. Ballerina, Victoria Page (Moira Shearer), to play the lead in a new ballet called \"The Red Shoes\". It was a long hard journey to get this far, and she had to reject human needs such as love with a brilliant young composer, Julian Craster (Marius Goring) because Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook), the ruthless but charismatic impresario of the Ballet Lermontov who she dance for, fears that she will leave his company for a chance of love. Now she is torn between her love for Julian and her need to dance. The question is which one will she picked. The movie has a story within the story, by having a long, long epic dance number of Hans Christian Andersen 'The Red Shoes'. This is one of the best ballet sequences I ever saw on screen, but it's still a creepy trip. It's out there. You don't know if it's a dream in her mind or a stage play. The movie score is dramatic and moving. The ballet was choreographed by Robert Helpmann, who plays the role of the lead dancer of the Ballet Lemontov and danced the part of the boyfriend, with L\u00e9onide Massine creating his own choreography for his role as the shoemaker; both Helpmann and Massine were major stars of the ballet world along with Moira Shearer and Ludmilla Tch\u00e9rina. The dancing is respectable. Still, I wouldn't say Robert Helpmann, and Ludmilla Tcherina were the best actors as when they were on screen speaking; it really sound pretty wooden. Too much exaggerated facial expressions and emotions, and continuous loud talking. The plot is kind out there and pretty dated. Vicky's transformation from chirpy English rose to suicidal fanatic doesn't connect right. I believe you can dance and find love. I don't buy the fact that choosing love over your career ultimately spill suicidal for you. Some people might not like the dark undertones of the film. The ending is depressing, but make sense. I don't buy the love affair between Vicky and Lermontov. Lermontov comes across as too anal to create any sexual tension between himself and Vicky. The visuals of the film were amazing and its cinematography, particularly its use of bright colors was beautiful. Although depending on the DVD, you got, there might be some strange variations in color. I kinda wish this movie was restored to the excellent viewing quality that some of the other classics have. I'm surprised how badly damage the film is in some of these DVD versions. I have to say that the Blu-Ray is probably the best one for this type of a film. Overall: Be prepared to be swept away by the music and the dancing, it's a good movie to watch. It's truly a classic.",

But personally, I find the ending needlessly forced. Still I love it, and cherish it. Anton Walbrook and Moria Shearer's performances are exceptionally glorius and just splendid.Once a great poet said \"What is Love? Baby don't hurt me, no more\" The answer is, as magnificent Boris Lermontov character put it: \"Adolescent non-sense\" (compared to art). Compared to the magic of 15 minutes Red Shoes Ballet scene, love is nothing. It is just a selfish hormonal activity lasts a year or two. Love is temporary, but art, the real art is eternal. And how many million times we have to watch movies revering and celebrating love (or family)? Why can't we have once in a while a movie revering and celebrating art? This movie was meant to be the one for me, but it failed short with a forced ending.Hans Christian Andersen's short fairy tale The Red Shoes is actually a suprisingly sick, twisted, puritan garbage. In it, a girl named Karen is obsessed with a pair of red shoes. When she gets them, she is doomed because the red shoes represent her (sexual and/or materialistic) desires. No, it does not end with the shoes forcing her to dance until she dies, as many of us heard. What really happens is, she begs an executioner to chop his feet off! So does he. Then she gets some wooden feet and a cane to walk and tries to move on with life, but the bloody shoes show up dancing in front of her Church. Only when Karen regrets and repents her sins, then the bewitched shoes go away. She finds her repentant and relieved self in her Church again, living happily, piously ever after, without feet, without desires but fear. Her religious faith is restored. You can listen to the whole short tale read by Liam Neeson in Criterion DVD/Blu-Ray.The Red Shoes fairy tale is rightly altered from its original by almost everyone. Same was done in this movie. The famous ballet sequence has little to do with the original fairy tale, other than the function of the red shoes. Same thing had to be done with the ending of the movie.Why the hell, Vicky -the woman- have to choose between her carrier and her love? Why is she so powerless and just takes her own life. It is such a disappointment that a perfect film ends like that. It does not have to be a tragedy like the crooked fairy tale. Instead, Vicky should have chosen her art, her performance, her blood and tears, and she could have just meet half way with his selfish husband. Then it would totally be a reverence and celebration of art, not just in shape and style, but in its core message.",

All important in the portrayal of the excitement in the movie. it is nice. not the boring kind. you'll not regret watching it.",

            "content": "Directed by Emeric Pressberger, The Red Shoes tells two stories, one on the stage based on the Han Christian Anderson fable about a ballerina who acquires a pair of magical dancing slippers, and then a similar parallel story behind the scenes about a woman who cannot give up dancing. This is, of course, the most famous film ever made about ballet, and it is brought to life from the team of Emeric Pressberger and Michael Powell (known as The Archers) whose films were always exquisite Technicolor productions. To see The Red Shoes is to see these two at their best.In the middle of one of the most glorious looking productions ever put on film is gorgeous, red-headed Moira Shearer. She plays Victoria Page, a socialite with such a talent for ballet that she joins the company of the rigid taskmaster Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook). She falls, almost immediately, in love with the company's new composer, Julian Craster (Marius Goring) despite the fact that Boris forbids those under his study from having romantic relationships. He feels that it steals the performer's concentration.Victoria becomes a sensation with her colleagues and the public. Boris promises to make her career under the condition that while she is in his service that he, essentially, owns her. He is a powerful man who has a way of making and breaking careers. \"You shall dance,\" he promises her \"and the world will follow.\" He offers her the lead in an adaptation of Han Christian Anderson's \"The Red Shoes,\" the story of a girl who comes into the possession of a pair of red ballet slippers that cause her to dance continuously until she dies.Victoria is caught between her love of dance and her love of Julian and despite Boris's disapproval; she carries on her relationship with Julian and eventually marries him, leaving the company behind. Boris is deeply hurt but is convinced that she will change her mind. She does, when he offers her a chance to once again perform in \"The Red Shoes,\" which he has forbidden to be performed in her absence.What happens in Victoria's mind and in her heart pulls her in two different directions, torn between her devotion to Boris and her love for Julian, she makes a decision that shocks us, her mind falls between two great loves and she cannot bear to choose. The tragic ending is built, not on contrivance, but on what has happened before. These three characters and their world are so specifically drawn that we understand fully why Vicky loves to dance and her deep love for Julian. We understand fully what drives her creative impulse and the passions that possess her heart.Shearer is brilliant in one of the great crossover performances in the history of the screen. She isn't tied down to a great deal of dialogue, but is a very physical actor, conveying more with her eyes and her body and her face than she does with her voice. She is allowed to dance in this film and dance she does. We understand fully what drives her creative impulse and it is displayed most beautifully in a 20-minute, dreamlike performance of \"The Red Shoes\" as she dances in and out of sequences that could not possibly exist on a real stage. The dancing is real but the surroundings are not and there are moments that are especially dazzling as when she encounters a newspaper that becomes a dancer, dances with Victoria, then becomes inanimate again. The joy and passion in this sequence give you an appreciation for her art and illustrate what it is that she sees when she is performing.In the real world, the relationship between Boris and Victoria is established at the beginning. He looks at her with suspicious eyes and asks, \"Why do you want to dance?\" There is a breath between them and she asks, \"Why do you want to live?\" He is shocked by her answer and stammers for a response: \"Well I don't know exactly why, but I must.\" She smiles, and says, \"That's my answer too\".From that moment, I think Boris has her number. He understands the kind of full-blooded passion that drives her heart. She will dance and he will command and he won't lose her to any distractions. He commands his company by reminding them that \"A dancer who relies upon the doubtful comforts of human love can never be a great dancer. Never.\" The film moves back and forth through the parallel stories of Victoria's struggle with her own heart and the ballet that is being constructed.The two performances are at opposite ends from one another. Boris is closed, imperious and cold. Victoria is open, passionate and full of the joy of life. She isn't allowed a great deal of dramatic scenes, which makes the final confrontation all the more powerful. We see in her face, joyfulness, a lust for life, this porcelain beauty with fiery red hair whose dancing is pure magic.Despite her brilliant performance, Shearer didn't think much of filmmaking. She never considered herself an actress, never liked the film industry, stating \"If I am dubious about films and film people, the film industry has only itself to blame.\" After making The Red Shoes, she went back to her ballet company, only occasionally returning to films. Her performance here would leave an impression behind \u2013 a performance that would draw many young girls to want to become a ballerina. I don't know if she would have given any notice to an Oscar nomination for her performance in The Red Shoes, but that doesn't mean she didn't deserve it.",

Everyone is happy for Irina except Boris who you figure out quickly, worked Irina day and night because he loved dance and had little tolerance for anything else.He finds his next prima, a dancer named Victoria to whom he stages Hans Christian Andersen's The Red Shoes for. Not only that, he finds his next Maestro at the same time, Jullian, who adapts the music for the ballet. Julian and Victoria fall in love, Boris NEVER has time for anything but his ballet and dance and wants everyone around him and in his ballet company to be the same so this new development upsets him greatly. And here is where art starts to imitate life.I've seen this movie only a few times in my life and every time I see it, I just love it..and those red shoes. I too am bias, I've always loved dancing but I am a compulsive. The Red Shoes would be me, I'd dance and dance and dance...and let the shoes just take over to the inevitable end.A wonderful motion picture that stands up to the test of time.",

            "content": "Words are hard in coming to mind in trying to describe the joy and beauty of witnessing a production like The Red Shoes. Often hailed as the masterpiece of British filmmakers Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, it tells the multiple stories at once, most notably that of a beautiful ballerina caught in a love triangle between the composer she loves and the lifestyle of dance she lives for. Love vs. dance. Which does she choose?The screenplay is based in part on Hans Christen Anderson's fairy-tale, but Powell and Pressburger take the material one step further by not even introducing the story until about an hour into the film. The first 50 minutes or so are strictly a behind the scenes look at how a ballet company is run. This particular one is managed by the stern and passionate Boris Lermentov, played to sublime perfection by Anton Walbrook, a most incredible actor who is unjustly unknown outside of a few British films. His acting holds this film together as he creates a character both envious and sympathetic as we somewhat understand the devotion he has to the art of ballet. None seem to be able to match it, of course, until the fiery-haired Vicky Page comes along who tempts him in ways possibly no other person ever has. To sum it up partially, this is a production of the most glorious quality. The art direction, cinematography, editing and direction perfectly synchronize together to create a film that causes feeling rather than simply the act of watching. The real theme of this film is the conflict between art and life and the consequences this can bring. Certainly there is much truth to this. One needs only to look at this film and understand that.",

            "content": "This RESTORATION 2 disc special DVD is as fantastically luminous as must be possible. The colour saturation as deep as is possible. Remember those TVs back in the 70's & 80's where, if you turned the colour up, you ended up with a garish and sickly nightmare?Truth is, we would have been trying to make the colours back then to look like this sumptuous Technicolor. But, it's actually the editing that strikes me this time, watching this version after three or four over the years on TV. It whips up and strikes like a knife, sending a whirling dervish of dark beauty, agonising tension and tumultuous crescendos. Deriving its source material from a deeper European folklore than Hollywood counterparts (I'm talking of those amazingly choreographed MGM musicals, rather than Ballet itself) and interweaving stories of love and disloyalty, we also live and breathe the life of the troupe as they take us on a tour of Society Europe. No pains are pushed aside, no agonies diminished.This may well be supremo cinematographer Jack Cardiff's most resplendent picture and its sequences remain much more memorable than, say of Black Narcissus. There is so much in it, with nods to - and from - Dr Jeckyll & Mr Hyde, to Czech animation, to name just two and topped with a sense of classical master Russian storytelling. The peaks of melodrama topple any version of Moulin Rouge and perhaps even gives Phantom of the Opera a run for its money. Even lovers of Hitchcock will see similarities.This is supremely absorbing and intelligent cinema that will always be a classic and can be enjoyed from ages eight to one hundred and eight. The fact that it is a wholly British affair also, should add to the little hairs on the back of the neck being tingled, this time, in the name of Pride. And not just from those really quite spooky scenes, either.So, why not 10/10? Well, my excuses are few and many could say are simply not good enough. It is a little starchy at times and quite long. Most film lovers like myself, I guess, wouldn't probably automatically utter its title as an all-time favourite but when reminded - and pressed - couldn't justifiably explain exactly why not.",

            "content": "Actually, 20 out of 10.This extraordinary movie has been watched all over the world throughout the nearly sixty years since it was made. Probably no day passes without it being shown somewhere in the world. I doubt these statements are true of any other movie except, perhaps, 'Casablanca'. Moreover, many of the people that love it don't particularly like ballet. Some actively dislike classical ballet. How can this be?It is so successful because the director pulls so many of the arts together in one construct, each and all of them to an unsurpassed standard. Dancers, musicians, composers, choreographers, actors, painters, stage designers, cinematographers, lighting designers, studio technicians - even producers! - all gave of their transcendental best to tell a universally well-loved, traditional folk-tale interpreted by one of the greatest storytellers ever, and to tell it as a ten-hankie love story.Other contributors to 'Comments' have, between them, already given all the credits due, but I must mention two artists who often get left out, upstaged by the more obvious talents of Walbrook, Shearer and Massine. First, and perhaps greatest of the lot, Jack Cardiff for his brilliant, innovative camera-work and Technicolor photography, especially because these were the early days of Technicolor and he, a hitherto unknown Brit cameraman, introduced, for the first time, a painterly eye which amazed the American Technicolor wizards. Second, Brian Easdale's music rarely gets proper credit, probably because the Red Shoes' sprightly theme is lifted directly from Elgar's 1901 'Cockaigne' overture. The music is no worse for that, as Easdale creates his own evocative variations with brilliant development and orchestration, precisely reflecting the style typical of contemporary ballet music in the first half of the 20th century. Exciting, emotional, highly rhythmic, eminently danceable ballet music, perfectly interpreting the subject.Moira Shearer (a dancer at the peak of her powers on the classical ballet stage at the time) was famed for the unrivalled precision of her dancing. She not only entranced us with her talent and gorgeous combination of red hair and creamy skin, but, at a (much) lower level, reduced males to blubber with the shot of her pert bottom in little dance shorts as she walked towards the exercise barre. Wow! I saw Red Shoes when it first came out in 1948, when I was a boy of sixteen and head-over-heels in love with my own real, beautiful ballet dancer!! Which is, of course, why I have seen it several times a year ever since, will continue to watch it until I make my own final exit, stage right, and will never accept any criticism whatsoever. Of course the story is over the top - this is ART, for Heaven's sake! And that driven bastard Lermontov is, unfortunately, only too right. As he says in the movie - \"NOTHING..matters..but..the..music.\" As I was to learn the hard way, human emotions ARE transitory, while art lives for ever.No real art gets made without enormous sacrifice.

            "content": "Taking its name from the 1845 fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen which proves vital to the plot, this is an excellent dancing extravaganza / psychological drama. I have never been to the ballet and I don't know too much about it but I know what I like and I simply adored this film. The choreography by Robert Helpmann and L\u00e9onide Massine is exquisite and the score by Brian Easdale and Sir Thomas Beecham complements it perfectly. The central performance of \"The Ballet of the Red Shoes\" is a joy to behold and the Technicolor cinematography of Jack Cardiff adds to the veritable visual feast immensely. It was a wise decision on Powell and Pressburger's part to make the ballet performance itself as cinematic and fantastical as possible rather than feel constrained by what would be possible to achieve on stage. As such, the audience is made to feel as if they have been transported to another world, something which all of the best performances / stories should do. All of these spectacular elements fit together perfectly but other things are needed to make a film successful and two of the most important of those are strong writing and direction. It is hardly surprising that Powell and Pressburger managed to deliver very impressive results on those fronts, given their track record. The stellar script has many interesting parallels to the fairy tale to the extent that the characters seem almost doomed to live it out. The film does not really hit its stride for about 35 minutes but, after that, it was never less than completely engrossing.While she may not be on the same level in terms of acting as previous Powell and Pressburger collaborators such as Deborah Kerr, Kim Hunter and Kathleen Byron, Moira Shearer is quite good as Vicky Page and seems to get better as the film progresses. Of course, she was not cast for her acting ability but for her superlative skills as a dancer. It was always a delight to watch her dance so she was the perfect choice for the role. A very ambitious young woman, she seeks the opportunity to dance under the tutelage of Boris Lermontov, a brilliant but ruthless impresario. She tells him that she lives to dance and nothing has ever meant as much to her. However, she develops a relationship with the Ballet Lermontov's composer Julian Craster, played very well by Marius Goring. After Lermontov fires Julian, she tells him that she will not continue at the Ballet Lermontov without him and she makes an unhappy exit from the most prestigious ballet company in the world. She and Julian soon marry but she becomes torn between her art and her love for him.The cold, calculating and emotionally repressed Lermontov is played with a sort of understated menace by Anton Walbrook, who certainly gives the best performance in the film. He is a rather strange character. Over time, he develops an unhealthy obsession with Vicky to the point that he can think of little else about her. However, there is no indication that his obsession is fueled by sexual desire. It is instead fueled by his oft-stated desire to transform her into the greatest ballet dancer that the world has ever known. He becomes extremely resentful of Julian when it becomes clear that his relationship with Vicky is more than mere infatuation. I think that he views her as being essentially an object to be moulded in the same way that a sculptor might view a slab of marble before he has carved a figure out of it. He does not really care for or about her as a person, only as a dancer.Eventually, Vicky realises that she cannot live without dance and rejoins the company. Julian confronts her and his presence forces her to choose between ballet and him. She is unable to do so and becomes hysterical but Julian leaves as he believes that all hope of a normal life with her has been lost. The experience shatters Vicky and her emotional instability leads to what can perhaps best be described as a moment of temporary insanity as she flings herself off the balcony onto the path of an oncoming train. She manages to survive for several minutes and, with her dying breath, asks Julian to remove her red shoes, which is exactly what happens at the end of the ballet. I think that this represents the fact that she, like her character, had no choice but to dance until she died and only in death could see get any release. As well as choreographing the film, Robert Helpmann and L\u00e9onide Massine acted and danced in it as Ivan Boleslawsky and Grischa Ljubov respectively. They were both good actors but watching them dance with Moira Shearer reminded me of the experience of watching more or less any Laurence Olivier film or Kenneth Branagh and Judi Dench in \"The Winter's Tale\" at the Garrick Theatre: I knew that I was unlikely to ever see a better example of the relevant craft in person or on screen. Powell and Pressburger regular Esmond Knight is excellent in the supporting role of the composer Livingstone Montagne, who resented the younger and more talented Julian. In that sense, he reminded me of the way that Salieri was depicted vis-\u00e0-vis Mozart in \"Amadeus\". The film also features nice small appearances from Austin Trevor, George Woodbridge, Irene Browne and a very young and uncredited Leslie Phillips in the first scene. Towards the end of the film, the distinctive voice of Patrick Troughton can be heard as a BBC radio announcer but he is likewise uncredited.Overall, this is a superb film. The less serious elements might have made a fun 1930s Fox musical starring Don Ameche and Alice Faye but the darker, psychological ones were not the sort of the thing that Hollywood would include in a musical for many years to come.",

If Michael Powell had not been so ingrained in the process of making this film, I do not believe it would have been as majestic and classical as it is.A foreign film, mostly filmed in English, the love that ruins and saves everything is not flippant. It is not pure passion, or lust. It's sweet, without being overexaggerated, which is key. The score is unarguably the best of Powell's films, the choreography...okay, separate section for the choreography.The ballet was so original, directed with the eye of a magician and the fervor of a child. A fairytale retold by a captivated soul, the dance of their life. Such beauty, eloquence, and powerful passion could only be supplemented by the artistry in the cinematography.On the stage the elements of the ballet are exaggerated, with waves from an ocean crashing, as if to say we're a stone's throw from death itself. These elements are also in the actions of the people offstage, emphasizing the point that in ballet, nothing is as simple as it seems.The acting was superb, with such frabjous characters as the ballerina, prima, diva, Victoria Page, wanting acceptance from her mentor even after marrying the man who should make all her dreams come true. Lermontov, both wizened, talented, and shrewd, and manipulative, hateful, and eager. The scene on the train, after everything has come to a climax, is the best example of dependency I've ever seen. The actual ballet of The Red Shoes is such a beatific and favorable metaphor that it works on every level.The confrontation between Victoria and her husband made shivers flow down my spine. Such emotion, hatred and pity, a knowledge that weakness can also be what one needs to survive.Spoiler Alert: The ending, with Victoria's suicide, was almost traumatizing.

            "content": "For years I had heard of how many directors had been influenced by the 1948 film by directing team Michael Powell, and Emeric Pressburger. The story about a young ballet dancer who wants nothing else in the world than to dance, until she meets her first true love is set against a beautiful score and glorious Technicolor. Starring Moira Shearer & Anton Walbrook The Red Shoes is a remarkable classic and one that the audience is fortunate enough to have restored for years worth of enjoyment. Martin Scorsese, one of the notable directors to have been inspired towards filmmaking because of the film The Red Shoes, had the film restored with painstaking detail, then screened at Cannes in 2009; audiences owe a great deal to his efforts for guaranteeing the film lives on nearly 70 years after its release.Victoria Page is a young dancer absolutely smitten with ballet, believing it to be the reason she is on planet earth; what else is life but to dance, she often ponders. When she meets, quite by chance, Boris Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) a well-known ballet impresario of a famous ballet company, she sees her dreams finally coming true when given a chance to dance in his company. The catch with Mr. Lermontov is that he requires full devotion from his dancers. Mr. Lermontov even becomes enraged when the young dancers in his troupe become engaged and leave dancing to build families. Mr. Lermontov demands fierce loyalty of those who work for him, in exchange, he gives them a chance to become world renown dancers and an unlimited artistic potential for their craft. Victoria has no problem devoting herself to Mr. Lermontov because she sees no other purpose in life but to dance. She is living her dream and gaining notoriety as one of Mr. Lermontov's dancers, especially when she dances The Red Shoes Ballet. It is through her quest for perfection, however, that Vicky grows to know The Red Shoes composer, Julian Craster (Marius Goring). After working together to make sure the ballet is perfect, the two grow to love each other, earning the wrath of Mr. Lermontov. Seeing that his next star ballerina is no longer solely loyal to him, he fires Julian, which leads to the resignation of Victoria Page. Torn between her love and being loyal to Julian and her devotion to her craft, Victoria Page must decide if marriage and true love will overrule what she believes to be her reason for life, ballet dancing.This film is every bit of the perfection I have always been told that it is. The pacing is perfect, enrapturing the audience from the opening scene of young people rushing into watch a ballet of Mr. Lermontov's. The camera work utilized in The Red Shows was nothing short of incredible. The turning cameras as Victoria dances, the close ups on the posters announcing each ballet, the panning of the cameras as the red shoes are being selected for the ballet, and the brilliant overlays all go to show the directorial prowess of Powell, and Pressburger. What brings the whole film together is the character of Boris Lermontov. The character that may be one of the most wonderfully complex characters to ever grace the screen, Anton Walbrook played the part with extreme skill. The God-like character of Mr. Lermontov brimming with his various frustrations that can not easily be named is a fantastic illustration of good filmmaking. The character demanded loyalty and was so careful to present the image that he was secure in himself and self-assured, yet overwhelmed with questioning doubts of his worth after the curtains of his ballets dropped. It wasn't simply sexual frustrations that enraged Mr. Lermontov when his dancers left him, there seemed to be a deep abandonment complex that filled his soul, that the audience is never fully made aware of, and oddly, that lack of knowledge is forgivable. We don't have to know why Lermontov is how he is, we're simply blessed with the opportunity to examine such a brilliantly complex character. The Red Shoes gives audiences a chance to explore beautifully intricate characters, witness gorgeous shots, and coloration, and see a magical retelling of a grim Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, a chance we should never pass up. Whether you are a fan of ballet or not, The Red Shoes is a film anyone can not only enjoy, but grow from.",

            "review_title": "A film of great beauty",
            "content": "Powell and Pressburger's 1948 film The Red Shoes is one of their most celebrated, and often crops up high on lists of the best British films. A Technicolor masterpiece, it remains a thing of beauty, but exactly what it is about has long been a matter of some debate.\nThe screenplay - which Powell and Pressburger wrote with Michael Winter - is loosely inspired by Hans Christian Anderson's story of the same name (which also inspires the story's eponymous ballet) of a pair of cursed ballet shoes. It follows a young ballerina named Victoria Page, who meets ballet impresario Boris Lermontov and is soon starring a ballet written by composer and conductor Julian Craster entitled \"The Red Shoes\". As the story unfolds, Victoria is caught between Lermontov's controlling desire for her reach the pinnacle of career and her love for Craster, whilst becoming increasingly consumed by the ballet, resulting in a shocking and tragic finale.\nPart drama, part romance, The Red Shoes was described by Powell as a film about dying for art. From the moment that Craster rewrites \"The Red Shoes\" and Victoria is ordered to listen to the music at every mealtime, the ballet starts to occupy her every waking moment her, as the surreal imagery of the film's central ballet sequence suggests, and this is of course ultimately reflected in the denouement as life imitates art and the red shoes - perhaps - claim Victoria's life. Various film critics have found different interpretations of the film, reading much into the symbolism on the display; that, ultimately, is part of its enduring appeal.\nOutsider of cinephiles however, the film's success probably lies in the fact that it is a thing of beauty. Jack Cardiff - who worked with Powell and Pressburger on Black Narcissus - provides the cinematography and is as much responsible for the film's gorgeous visuals as the Technicolor is. Much of the film is shot on location, mainly in Paris, whilst some is shot in studio and it all looks impeccable; many of the sets are of course of sets. The story requires Powell and Pressburger not just to direct a film, but also a ballet, with the famous seventeen minute performance of the eponymous work. The sequence wasn't filmed as a ballet performed in front of a camera however, but is instead a far more technically complex accomplishment that involves a variety of sets and a whole host of extras, all of them dancers, not to mention special effects. It becomes increasingly nightmarish and surreal as it progresses, providing a great deal of the imagery that has fuelled differing theories as to what the film is actually about.\nPowell and Pressburger were determined to cast dancers who could act rather than actors who could dance, a gamble that pays off, most notably in the central casting of professional ballet dancer Moira Shearer as Victoria Page, who gives a fine performance throughout. Similarly, Australian ballet legend Sir Robert Helpmann is well cast as Ivan Boleslawsky and gives a hilariously arch performance. The two male leads are filled not dancers who can act since their roles require no dancing, but are instead played by Anton Walbrook and Marius Goring, both of whom unsurprisingly give consummate performances. Goring is astonishingly convincing as an impassioned composer and conductor, whilst Walbrook convincingly conveys Lermontov's obsessive jealousy when he learns that Victoria is in love with Craster and ultimately forces her to choose between her art and her love, resulting in her death.\nThe nature of the plot means that the film is a treat for classical music fans, thanks to Brian Easdale's soundtrack, which includes the music for the titular ballet; it is as pleasing to the ear as it is to the eye. Powell and Pressburger made many fine films at the height of their career and opinion is bound to differ as to which is their best; undoubtedly however, The Red Shoes is a strong contender.",

            "content": "The Red Shoes influenced a great number of filmmakers, actors, and inspired many dancers and those in the ballet. The Red Shoes combines the beauty of film, music, dance, ballet, and the human form. The story is based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale. Moira Shearer plays a young and beautiful ballerina named Victoria Page. Anton Walbrook is the zealous and tyrannical ballet impresario who sees a great talent in her and is determined to forge her into a great dancer and to make her a star in the ballet \"The Red Shoes.\" Rounding out the leading trio from which the conflict revolves is Marius Goring, a young composer who gets a chance to compose the music to the ballet. When Goring falls in love with Shearer, both their careers are put on the back burner. Walbrook and his ballet are threatened and he becomes more domineering than ever. Shearer becomes torn between love and dance and must ultimately choose between them. The story is done very stylized instead of realistically. The romance is very operatic and is right out of a tragic faerie tale. One of the most noticeable elements of the movie is the color of it. Jack Cardiff did the cinematography and it's absolutely gorgeous. The beautiful landscape shots work well juxtaposed with the matte paintings. The color red is prevalent and is a metaphor for love, passion, and jealousy. We see the vibrant color in Shearer's hair, her lipstick, the shoes. We see red in Goring's hair. All the lighting has a red tint to it with the gorgeous technicolor. Some of the special effects are absolutely miraculous and very innovative considering the release date. One of the most impressive things about the movie is how it offers both cinema and the ballet. The ballet sequences are spectacular and authentic. Shearer as well as the supporting dancers were actual performers of the ballet. In a stroke of genius director Michael Powell and writer Emeric Pressburger cast dancers and had them act instead of casting actors and having them dance. This is obvious during the ballet numbers in the film. The initial performing of \"The Red Shoes\" is a 15-20 minute sequence that is some of the best stuff ever caught on film. What the audience sees is an actual ballet performed and filmed, as opposed to just recreating and staging a fake ballet. Many of the special effects and backdrops during this dance number will leave the viewer in awe. If any criticism could be directed towards The Red Shoes it has to be the acting. But this isn't an actors movie. It's theatrical and doesn't demand realistic and down beat performances. The magic of film and dance make the audience forget the somewhat bland characterizations from the actors. The influence of this movie can be seen and hinted at in other movies. The storyline carries heavy tones in Moulin Rouge! There is a dancing newspaper, which no doubt inspired one of American Beauty's most talked about scenes. Since much of the film takes place at the ballet and the behind the scenes rehearsals it might be difficult for some movie-goers to get involved in the movie. But stick with it and let the beauty of it all slowly sink in.",

He adds Julian Craster, played by Marius Goring, a composer and conductor, and then he also accepts Victoria Page, played by Moira Shearer, a ballerina. In what was evidently his greatest performance, Boris Lermontov is played by Anton Walbrook. Before long, Julian and Victoria get to know each other, working together, and then the plot thickens.Boris Lermontov is not married. One could say that he was married instead only to the very concept of the ballet itself, and he did expect the same from his leading ballerinas. In a short time, in his professional capacity, he then surmises that Vicky, as he now calls her, with appropriate training, can become a most startling phenomenon, a truly great ballerina, dramatically surpassing all of his other leading ballerinas. However, what about the parallel growing relationship between Vicky and Julian?As it thereby happens, this motion picture has the unique quality such that every time you see it, it keeps getting better and better, and so you will always want to see it again. In fact, this could even turn out to be the greatest motion picture ever made. For example, here are three lines that are spoken that could easily give you goose pimples:Why do you want to dance? Why do you want to live?Time goes by, love goes by, life goes by.Julian, take off the Red Shoes.Even from these three lines, the genius of this motion picture emerges as we see how the role of Vicky in The Ballet of the Red Shoes reflects what for her is her real life itself. Time goes by, love goes by, life goes by.Concluding, when you do see this motion picture, be sure to turn off your mobile phone; and if needs be, turn off the player until you resume.

            "content": "The world is always saturated, in any field of art, with subpar works that are constructed in such a way as to not aim high but rather appeal to the generally vapid idea of a \"lowest common denominator\". But there are many filmmakers who have made many films that take cinema seriously. It doesn't translate to serious films, necessarily, but there are those films that are driven because they're obsessed, haunted and only art itself, their existence, seems to give remedy.\"The Red Shoes\" is such a film; striving towards the heights ambitiously, in this sense it is a film about itself. It's full of characters equally driven, all else crumbling beneath the vision and its realization. And as such we love it, because I suppose we are equally driven in our observational occupation as filmgoers. The central hallucinatory sequence is the highlight of the film for me, so modern (as vague a term as it is, but still), fresh even now, evocative not only of the fulfillment of the inner story of the ballet but also ours, a phantasmagoric ecstasy. The red shoes themselves become alive, seeping through from the inner ballet narrative to the larger narrative as a nightmarish emblem; not that it hasn't been just that for us from the very beginning, but now it also becomes that to the characters as well, so we become doubly involved.It would be a strange review of the film that wouldn't mention Moira Shearer at all. I suppose I just take for granted that we've all fallen in love with her. She is perfect as Victoria: fragile, her art full of ambition, yet completely seductive it makes no wonder the characters in the film fall in love with Victoria. But perfectly cast are also Marius Goring as Julian, his ambition expressed in youthful paroxysms of emotion, and Anton Walbrook as Bori Lermontov. Walbrook had already made a few brilliant films with the Archers, and he's also wonderful in Oph\u00fcls' films. They all enrich his performance here, I think. The new restoration is utterly gorgeous, and we're lucky to have it available on Blu-ray in several regions. I have the Criterion, and it is a lovingly put together edition, but one wouldn't go wrong in Region B, either, where the same restoration has been released by ITV. A film like this would deserve nothing less.",

The impresario takes a young ballerina under his wing. In Flesh and Bones we have the same with the director who takes a young ballet dancer under his wing. Both of these characters were like Svengali, and demanded much of the dancers to the point of excluding them a life outside of the dance. Even the premise was similar The Red Shoes a fairy tale, and for me I found Flesh and Bones was a dark and disturbing fairy tale of a young troubled dancer escaping her life and being finally set free by the Knight who slays the dragon. The one difference was for me it was so innocently produced, no horrific graphical sexual scenes covering such things as incest and sodomy.The story ended as the Ballet The Red Shoes came to life. It was quite sad at the ending and i must admit I did shed a tear or two on both of them. I would recommend this film to youngsters who love the ballet, even with dramatic content. The dancing was simply superb the scenery at times breath taking, and i actually felt sorry for the Impresario as i felt he actually was in love with Moria Shearers character, and used her love for the ballet to come back to him.",

The story is interesting, though the love interest of Walbrook and Goring with Shearer never quite seemed convincing.The main let down, though, was the musical score throughout. While Jack Cardiff was an accomplished composer his aesthetic values are simply not mine. Bereft of strong themes, logical structure and comprehensive form, the score supported dance sequences that for me lacked logical progression. Too, the initial themes seemed weak, followed by passages that lacked strong connection to the fundamental statements. The ballet's been compared to \"An American in Paris,\" though the latter was buoyed by Gershwin's incomparable themes and design. In short, I was underwhelmed by both the \"Red Shoes\" ballet music and its contrived love triangle.

Far too okay for those 1940s somewhat wink-wink The Wizard of Oz (1939). Music and camera work are on top; it's the story itself and how things unfold. Considerable amounts of lush color pop so does her red hair. It's overdramatic not Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) but All About Eve (1950). Michael Powell presents us with unlikeable characters that extend to our lady Victoria Page (Moira Shearer). This movie makes me love independent films even more. You may disagree. However, I think this movie was unbearable, and nothing feels like it starts in this movie, a plot hiatus. I had the clock on me almost every minute, at least once or twice a minute, and was busy doing something irrelevant.

            "content": "Thus is the central theme of The Red Shoes: to achieve true mastery of anything, one must make great sacrifice. It isn't a unique concept by any means, but a powerful one that has had very much success on the screen recently with phenomenal films like Whiplash and Black Swan. In fact, it is very clear after watching this film that Aronosfky was heavily influenced by it, even directly taking some camera techniques like the first-person angle as the lead pirouettes.But where Black Swan is a dark and disturbing thriller, The Red Shoes is more of a drama, firmly rooted in reality (save for the hallucinatory and breathtaking performance of the titular ballet midway through... but more on that later). Rather than portray a sacrifice of the mind as we saw with Natalie Portman's descent into madness in Black Swan, The Red Shoes focuses more on social sacrifice.Similar to Whiplash, we have a ruthless ballet leader, Boris Lermontov, whose greatest focus and ambition in life is to create the greatest dancer the world has ever seen. He is consumed by the art, likening it to a religion, and demands that his dancers abide by the same philosophy. To work with him, they most forgo simple human pleasures like love and marriage, as he believes these will corrupt their ability to practice and perform with all of their focus.Enter composer Julian Crastor and ballerina Victoria Page, both of whom are supremely talented in their respective fields and have lofty ambitions for their own artistic pursuits. Lermontov sees a similar passion in them as he has himself, and selects them both for his dance company, culminating in the on-screen performance of \"The Red Shoes\", their first ballet together as a trio.I can't say enough about the how great this performance is filmed and executed. While the rest of the film feels very realistic and dramatic, the ballet performance is like watching a dream. The themes of the movie untether themselves from the script and are brought to life visually in a magnificent way. There is some truly fantastic editing throughout the sequence and the entire thing is extremely compelling as Page's character is forced to feverishly dance by her magical red shoes until she eventually drops dead. The way the performance spirals downward to become more and more bizarre with imagery that is darker and darker is handled extremely well and helps the themes really hit home.After the performance ends, we reenter the real world and the movie continues in the dramatic, realistic fashion as had been previously established. The crux of the plot from here is that Page and Crastor develop a romance, which Lermontov obviously disapproves of. Long story short, Page must choose between her love of dance and her love of Crastor, ultimately driving her to an attempt at suicide. There is a lovely scene directly afterward where \"The Red Shoes\" is performed with everyone except Page as a tribute to her. It's moments like these that really separate good films from great ones - that image of the empty spotlight on stage packs an emotional punch which is very memorable and greatly reinforces of the themes at hand.Honestly, I thought the whole latter section of the movie was handled very well. I could definitely sense a theme of paternalism, which makes a lot of sense given the time period during which this film was made. After deciding to forgo dance and marrying Crastor, his career flourishes and she starts to live in his shadow - a \"housewife\", as Lermontov so eloquently puts it. There is some good commentary here on women's role in society at that time and how that ran contrary to their ambitions and visions for themselves. There is also a nice amount of depth to the character of Lermontov which reveals itself at this point. You begin to wonder if his displeasure with Page's marriage is purely due to his ideals about dance, or if he is driven by jealousy of their love which he has never allowed himself to experience in his own life. From what I could tell on a first viewing, it is left relatively ambiguous whether he actually has feelings for Page, or if he simply is jealous that they have something he doesn't. Even a further wrinkle here is that perhaps he is jealous of their raw talent as artists. Although he is a great coordinator and director of his ballet, during the actual performance he is ultimately relegated to the stands where he must sit and watch, but never participate. He may very well yearn for their talent which he doesn't possess himself.I really did enjoy this move quite a lot. It was an excellent exploration of this theme of sacrifice for art, and this is probably one of the first movies to really explore it in such depth. I will say that the dream-like ballet performance midway through the film is the true climax and pinnacle of what the film accomplishes, and the unfortunate result is that the more dramatic and realistic tone of the rest of the movie left me wishing for more abstraction. Also, the fact that the climax occurs midway through the film does take the wind out of the sails a bit for the rest, no matter how well it is handled and executed (which is very well). The very end of the movie is also climactic, but it doesn't really reach the heights of the full ballet sequence. In any case, this is still an excellent film from beginning to end and definitely leaves you with plenty to ponder about artistic pursuit and sacrifice.",

            "review_title": "The magic of Powell & Pressburger",
            "content": "British cinema often gets criticised for its so-called narrow milieu, be it historical/period dramas, feel-good comedies, social realism & gangster films. The films of Powell & Pressburger stand apart, distinctive in the English canon, the artistic marriage in this post-Brexit age of an English maverick (eccentric individualism) to the European sensibility of the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Pressburger. Their retinue (such as the cinematography of Jack Cardiff) produced films that are imaginative, passionate, full of dramatic power & beauty. What struck me about 'The Red Shoes', their wonderful modern take on Andersen's tragic fairy-tale, is how ravishing it must have looked to a post-war audience worn down by war & still enduring rationing. A film cannot fill an empty stomach, but the cinematography, the bright colours & exotic locales must have been a feast for the eyes, art as both escapism & entertainment.The story is elegantly structured with the ballet segment 'The Red Shoes', a stand-alone piece on its own as entertainment but which reflects the story set in the present (Lermontov as the shoe-maker who entices the girl to wear the red shoes, the circus represents international fame). Vicky & Julian are introduced, both overcoming initial obstacles to their dreams, then begin to impress the stern task-master Lermontov before fate offers them a chance to finally realise their ambitions.'The Red Shoes' is the story of a young woman who dreams of becoming a celebrated ballerina, though in the background hovers the whisper of 'be careful what you wish for'. It is the story of Vicky's relationship with two men & the eventual conflict which sees them wrest for control of her.Lermontov (Anton Walbrook) is a fascinating character, portrayed as darkly charismatic, detached & cynical, an aesthete, a Diaghilev-svengali type of figure, who runs a world famous ballet company. He is obsessed with art to the point that he demands absolute loyalty to its precepts, even to the extreme where he denies the human, which, in itself, is a contradiction because art is in itself the deepest expression of the self, of our selves & what it is to be human. He is a control freak (the miniature ballet stage on his desk in Paris), one of the ballets referenced in a montage is 'Coppelia' based on Hoffmann, a tale about a diabolical inventor & his mechanical doll. Vicky, too, makes a diabolical pact with the Mephistophelian Lermontov as he & his travelling ballet company casts its spell over her. It will also demand a human sacrifice (Rites of Spring). In the same Paris office, a slightly sinister plaster-cast sculpture of a ballerina's foot anticipates the tragic ending.Julian Craster, in a less obvious way, also mistreats Vicky. He is impetuous & passionate, perhaps representing the emotions. Together, Craster & Lermontov produce a masterpiece & platform for Vicky's talent. After his marriage to Vicky, he returns to his work as he cannot resist the creative impulse, but fails to realise that she, too, has a need for self-expression. Both Lermontov & Craster deny Vicky her individuality: the first views her as his creation, demanding absolute loyalty, the other views her as his muse, subservient to his wishes.The ending is poignant, the ghostly last performance of 'The Red Shoes' & Vicky's final haunting request.",

The performances, both acting and dancing, are spectacular. The choreography of Anton Walbrook is astounding and a wonder to watch - only Gene Kelly did a better job of choreographing for the silver screen. I highly recommend that people track down a copy of this film and watch it, it is a fine example of what I consider the peak period of British film making. As for those who claim it is not the best work of The Archers, I say it doesn't have to be their best to be damn good.

I could also not help wondering if the ballet sequences in several other movies were influenced by the Red Shoes...Singing in the Rain and American in Paris to name two. The acting was surprisingly good particularly Moira Shearer and Anton Walbrook. However Christopher Challis' camera work and the production design were sumptuous. My favourite scenes are when Moira Shearer jumps into the Red Shoes in the ballet sequence and when she and Marius Goring take the moonlit ride up the coast with the moon glinting off the Mediterranean. This movie must have been a breath of fresh air to the world after the second war with its sunny sets and energetic dancing shaking off the dark hues of death. I hope this movie is available on DVD!",

Also, here's some links that may interest: http://tinyurl.com/bjkf765 http://www.imdb.com/event/ev0000003/1948'The Red Shoes' is a colossal achievement and has so many inspiring details that the only question is how great it is compared to the rest of cinema's best. The script braves adhering to a fable where a universe defined in the beginning is erased by the one at the end. Of course the closing sequences are not plausible; but neither is the fable. The joy here is allowing ourselves to accept plot contradictions that are as clearly defined as are Moira Shearer's dance moves. The talent involved in this production is off the charts. In Shearer they found major eye candy that can plausibly pass for the \"greatest dancer in the world.\" In Anton Walbrook they have a suitably frightening source of power. Marius Goring's Julian Craster is youthful and passionate; and Craster's lines are legitimate for a composer. Robert Helpmann's choreography is on a short list for best dance in cinema ever. They needed a musical score that could pass for top-shelf and Brian Easdale provided it.With so much talent involved Powell and Pressburger deserve praise for just keeping them all on the same page. (For laughs, check out the recipients of the 1948 Academy Awards. How many of the major awards surpass the participants in 'Red Shoes'? I think \"Red Shoes\" should have swept the entire 1948 Awards.)Vicky's entrance is very quiet. We first see her apparently in the back row of the theater watching with Shearer's trademark sly grin. She is the only character that we will eventually view from her perspective. This happens notably when she spins in her London performance. (The repetition of the view of the crowd suggests she's hitting her spots on the dime.) We also view from her perspective during the astounding 15-minute, expressionistic ballet centerpiece. The script wants us to identify with her and feel her pain. Judging by the reviews so far, it succeeds.The early scenes are dazzling. I really love how the script makes us wonder if she is ever going to get her chance to perform for Lermontov (or us, for that matter). I also love it as Shearer's Vicky continually bickers with Goring's Craster over the pacing of a particular scene.Julian's lines when he and Vicky are together in the horse-drawn carriage are sublime. Has a character's love for another ever been expressed so memorably?Vicky and Julian are both artistic geniuses. Meanwhile, Lermontov's actions remind us that art is never going to persist in the face of reality. That's the lament of every artist who has ever, and will ever live.'The Red Shoes' has enormous appeal among those who create and those who dream.",

            "content": "Although I would rate both versions of \"The Red Shoes\" from good to excellent, I would rate the 1948 version slightly higher. Why? Because there are cultural differences, and something is lost in the translation. This is not to say that the 1948 interpretation is better or correct, but there are marked difference in the direction of each productions. In the cultural differences, there is a great diversity in beliefs and values. And, that diversity takes the audience on a different 1990's Hispanic trip, from where the 1948's Caucasian 'red shoes' were going. The 1990's version tells the audience that 'you don't have to have money, in order to be rich'. And, that 'if you're not connected to people, you might as well be dead'. In both versions, there is different music, and a different dance. And, there are different beats and different rhythms. This conveys a contrast in feelings. In the 1990's version, the 'red shoes' are dancing to an urban New York City, almost \"West Side Story\" kind of Latin beat. In the 1948 version, the 'red shoes' are dancing to the rhythm of a classical music's ballet, dominated by a golden-era Hollywood kind of Caucasian perspectives. The dancing, in both versions, is beautiful, moving, and striking. But, the pendulum in the 1990's version strikes a different chord, and that arouses a whole set of different feelings, evoking non-traditional and new ways of looking at traditional and nineteenth-century ways of looking at unresolved issues. Such emphatic differences make it clear that we as people, regardless of our ethnic and cultural backgrounds, are still engaging in avoidance and denial about some major and very significant issues, which are pertinent and relevant. Both versions of \"The Red Shoes\" make it clear that people are still unwilling to confront the pain, which sometimes accompanies the pleasures in life. Different beliefs and values are okay, but they must not interfere with people's willingness to look at issues with honesty and openness. The 1960's brought issues, out of their closets, in an attempt to evoke discussion. But, there was much bloodshed, chaos, and violence. Issues, which were brought out in the open to elicit discussion, instead evoked angry and frustrated reactions. In this, the New Millennium, the pendulum of time is swinging from the left's domain of liberal thought, to the right's domain of conservative expression. And, the rather ugly battle wages on, with the battering ram of liberal thought and conservative expression, and the middle-of-the- road dance caught in-between conservative and liberal thoughts, feeling, and acts. As I see it (and you don't have to agree with how I see things), the moderates are struggling to find a balance in their particular domain of thoughts and feelings. The problem is that the conservatives are on a narrow, rigid road. There is no flexibility. In sharp contrast, the liberals want a broad and tolerant, if not a completely-accepting road, and neither the conservatives nor the liberals will allow the moderates middle-of-the-road dance of in-between. It is clear that, in our battle for equality and fairness, a significant number of people still want all or nothing--they want the whole pie, or want none of the pie. As people, we still will not be satisfied with a more-equal, and more-fair, piece of the pie. We greedily want the whole thing, and we still have not learned to share. Will the 'red shoes' take us to where we need to go? Only time will tell us, for certain, but the 'red shoes' are learning new, non-traditional steps to an old and difficult dance between doing what is ethical, what is moral, what is politically correct, and what is the more equal and more fair thing to do. Caught in a dilemma, the 'red shoes' know how to dance, but they are uncertain of which way to go.",
