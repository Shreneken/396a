            "content": "\"The Magdalene Sisters\" is not, as some have claimed, a one-dimensional anti-Catholic film exploiting what are arguably especially gruesome atrocities.  It is a fact-based drama about three teenage girls who found themselves in 1964 sentenced to work in a laundry run by an Irish religious order for an indefinite term and under conditions that made most audience members shudder.In three brief vignettes before the main title, the girls are introduced. One is brutally raped by a cousin at a wedding while priests perform traditional Irish songs.  Immediately telling a woman, instead of support she becomes the subject of a hasty conspiracy to spirit the rapist from the wedding and to place her in the Magdalene asylum.A second girl gives birth to a baby - in the not long ago past, illegitimacy was the label.  She is pressured by a priest to surrender the baby boy and then she, too, is hustled off to the asylum.The third victim is in an orphanage where she gets under the director's skin for no other offense than she is pretty and boys from the neighborhood crowd a fence to call down to her.  Transfer to the asylum follows.The Magdalene laundries made money for the order running them and the asylum to which the three girls were committed is, in this film,  a moral charnel house.  Sister Bridget, the head nun, interviews the girls while fingering, with almost erotic delight, rolls of money. Her desk sports a photo of President Kennedy but a picture of Ilse Koch would have been a more suitable iconographic representation of her character.  She is a sadist, first class.What follows is almost unrelieved tedium for the girls interspersed with brutal physical chastisement and agonizing sexual humiliation inflicted by perverted nuns.  Sexual orientation isn't my issue, it's the awful victimization of helpless young girls.Through the fine acting of the cast the complexity of relationships and the nature of choices become engrossing. To accommodate or to resist.  To comply or to engage in sabotage, even in small ways as a declaration of non-surrender.  Sabotage is possible but can an inexperienced and angry teen foresee the consequences of a minor act of resistance?  An anticipated humorous defiance may well have tragic results.The film centers on the three girls as well as several other asylum inmates ranging from a young woman descending slowly into irreversible madness and an elderly crone who believes her lifetime of servitude guarantees entrance to the Kingdom of Heaven.  This tortured soul is the nuns' \"capo,\" the inmate without whose help the asylum's strictures can't be enforced. Comparison to the Gulag camps and the Nazi concentration camps is apropos.\"The Magdalene Sisters\" doesn't portray all the girls as angels but it does show the nuns and the occasional male clergy as evil exploiters and sadistic hypocrites.  Is that fair?  The end credits report that some 30,000 women were involuntarily placed in Magdalene asylums until the last one closed in 1996.  Were all inmates so tortured and beaten?  I don't know but these three girls certainly have had THEIR experience recorded for a population that appears to have turned a blind eye to what should have been a national scandal decades earlier.  Their life after the asylum is reported in the end credits. All paid a price for a stolen adolescence.The asylum in this film is pure evil, religious doctrine run amuck in the quest for money through cheap labor and in the riotous unleashing of perversity.  English judges for centuries have often used a word rarely found in  American case law to describe persons and events: the word is wicked.  This film projects an unending parade of wicked people performing wicked acts.  It doesn't condemn Catholicism, it indicts the operation by the church in Ireland of one type of soul and body destroying evil.  The Church can no more defend the Magdalene asylums than it can the predatory pedophiles in the priesthood.  That's the simple reality.Audience members loudly gasped and a number cried during the showing. This isn't a film for the fainthearted or those who want their illusions about a bucolic and verdant Ireland filled with dancing and music unaffected by the reality of a genuine tragedy now coming to light.8/10.",

            "review_title": "The other, other kind of terrorism.",
            "content": "I inadvertently found myself watching a whole string of movies the other day about people being tortured or torturing themselves, without even looking for movies like that. I saw The Magdalene Sisters, Osama, and that IMAX film Everest, all in the same day, and was surprised at their similarities, particularly between the first two. The Magdalene Sisters and Osama are strikingly similar in that they are both about religious terrorism, specifically centered around women. Osama was a look at how the Taliban keeps women under tight control, not allowing them even the tiniest freedom (indeed, women could be arrested and severely punished for such crimes as walking alone in public or speaking to a man, even for such dangerous statements as, 'My father is sick.'), while The Magdalene Sisters is about the Catholic Church in Ireland in disturbingly recent times, severely punishing women as a result of what appears to be the Church's frothing and highly irrational fear of sex.The film focuses on the plights of three women in particular, who have all committed 'crimes' of varying nature but who are all punished by being sent to the Magdalene laundry for an indefinite period of time. One girl, Rose, commits the greatest crime having a child out of wedlock, which neither of her parents will even look at. Interestingly, she had the child because an abortion would have been a sin. Bernadette makes the mortal mistake of flirting with boys outside the orphanage she lived in, and Margaret is raped at a family gathering by a cousin, only to be shipped off herself when she reports it to family members.At the Magdalene laundry, the girls are subjected to psychological abuse and endless physical toil, all under the old theory that it will cleanse their souls. Some of the women that the three girls in question encounter as they enter the laundry have been there for decades, and they eventually figure out that the only way that they are ever going to get out of there is to escape. Bernadette is especially aware of this, and makes increasing efforts to escape, for which she is brutally punished.I am genuinely curious to know what path of logic leads people to believe that such practices in the name of religion can have any beneficial value. The Taliban has taken religious torture to its extreme, debasing themselves and their religion by performing unbelievably inhuman acts in the name of their God, and it appears that, while certainly not on the same level of cruelty, the Catholic Church has performed similar crimes against humanity. That the Catholic Church in Ireland promptly condemned the film is not surprising, but if such things are being committed under its name (and indeed continued being committed well into the late 1990s), I should think that the Church would at least allow the film to be shown so that people would be aware of such abuses, which tarnish the reputation of the Church. I believe that it would have been possible for the Church to defend its own validity while at the same time acknowledging abuses committed in its name, especially if the accusations of cruelty were untrue, although in this case they were not. Running, however, only makes you look guilty.The Magdalene laundry is presided over by a nun who is simply evil. She is an elderly lady and generally soft-spoken, but this woman makes the wicked witch of the west look like a prancing schoolgirl. The viciousness of the rest of the Sisters of Mercy radiates off of this woman like some kind of sinister force, delicately but successfully walking the line between illustrating the harshness of a brutal religious regime and creating a movie monster. Her character is human, but she's not far from being a monster.It's disheartening to see the things that people do in the name of religion, especially when the crimes are something as little as behaving like a normal person. There are natural and perfectly healthy behaviors that unfortunately are violations of arbitrary religious laws, which are subsequently punished with outlandish punishments like those seen in this movie. Religion is thrown into reverse, causing pain and suffering rather than offering an escape from it, shown in a modern setting that is so backwards that it could just as easily have taken place in the 1600s.",

The actual names and circumstances appear to have been changed for the screenplay, but the original 50-minute documentary, filmed likely in the mid 1990s, tells us that everything, and more, happened to these children, virtually imprisoned for such things as having a child out of wedlock, or being sexually assaulted, or simply happening to look pretty. With no way out, they were forced to work long hours for no pay, operating the Magdalene Sisters' commercial laundry business, the last one until 1996. As one character, the old nun, explains, a strong Ireland requires that its men remain strong, so we have to remove temptation. The critic Ebert has a complete review. The only relevant \"extra\" on the DVD is the documentary, which features old photos and film, plus remarkable interviews with ladies who had been in a Magdalene Sisters asylum in the 1940s through the 1960s, including the three ladies around whom the movie's three main characters were built. A very gripping movie, well-acted.",

            "content": "Peter Mullan's (2002) film is based primarily upon the TV documentary 'Sex in a Cold Climate' by Steve Humphries which was first aired on RTE (Ireland) and BBC (England) in 1998. The documentary records the recollections of four Irish women who spent their youth and a good proportion of their adult lives as involuntary guests of uncompromising Roman Catholic nuns.The film is set in a particular example of this institution which, somewhat akin to the English workhouses of the late 19th and early 20th century, became established in Ireland after the Second World War. The Magdelene Laundries took their name from the biblical figure of Mary Magdalene, a 'fallen woman' whom Christ befriended.We join the main heroines of the movie - Margarette (Anne-Marie Duff), Bernadette (Norah-Jane No one), Rose (Dorothy Duffy) and Crispina (Eileen Walsh) in cameo as their entrance scholarships for the Magdelene Laundry are being sat.What's most uncomfortable about this part of the movie, is trying to work out what's going on. Trying to work out what it is that's being whispered and what will be the upshot of it, and why. At first, it seems like the soundtrack of the film and the contrast have failed. But before long, it becomes obvious that the soundtrack of the film and the contrast have succeeded. The dark and deafening silence surrounding the circumstances under which these young women are being consigned to the unwelcome stewardship of the Magdalene Sisters comes through loud and muted.We follow their induction into the laundry by Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan), ably assisted by the Sisters Jude (Frances Healy), Clemantine (Eithne McGuinness) and Augusta (Phyllis MacMahon) who contrive with formally celibate gentlemen like Father Fitzroy (Daniel Costello) to represent a world in which God's greatest ideal is achieved through punishment and penitence.As the film progresses, we begin to understand why it is no accident that these institutions should have been laundries. They could - after all - have been bakeries, dairies, canneries or places where mailbags are sewn.With every garment that passes through the process, unmentionable filth is cleansed - if the Sisters are to be believed. And if the Sisters are to be believed, the sins of the teenagers and the route to Heaven is bound up in hot water, salt and flagellation.And as we follow these unsaintly girls on their hapless journey, we finally learn that salvation is as straightforward as a letter we are not privileged to read and a brother who arrives with a suitcase - as if there is anything that anybody could possibly want to carry away from a place like this.This film is a powerful elegy to the suffering of these unfortunate girls who, constrained to silence for so long, have finally found a voice.",

Absolutely nothing; they were both guilty of unspeakable crimes against these girls.What is the difference between the nuns and Southerners? Absolutely nothing; they both used people as slaves.The nuns silence as a weapon to keep the women from getting to know each other. One woman (Mary Murray) who ran away is brought back by her father (Peter Mullan), who beats her up in front of the women in the dormitory. Her hair is then cut off by Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan) in an attempt to further degrade her. In another instance, the three new arrivals along with others are forced to stand naked in front of a nun who ridicules their body parts. Crispina (Eileen Walsh) is sexually abused by a priest.The Catholic Church has never apologized for the horrendous and inhumane treatment of over 10,000 girls that were imprisoned in these asylums over a period of 70 years, ending as recently as 1996. To this day, various Christian, Jewish and Islamic fundamentalists continue to subjugate women on account of their fear and hatred of female sexuality and freedom.",

The movie has it's flaws, but drawing empathy from the viewer is not one of them and this it does so well that I was emotionally exhausted by the end of it.The religious dimension of the film is an interesting one. Clearly people wanting opportunity for anti-Catholic or anti-religious diatribe would find plenty of fuel here, but I think the more reasonable viewer (religious or not) would see the issues raised for what they are - a perversion and distortion of Christian faith perpetuated and maintained by flawed institutional systems. In this vein, it's not necessarily an anti-religious film and not even anti-establishment as such, but it does show a terrible side of those things and, moreover, illustrate how human beings can take any ideology, belief system etc. and turn it to meet their own personal sadistic and evil ends.A sad and horrible film and one that reminds us all of what not do to, how not to treat people and how we should be ever vigilant as a society against evil and cruelty no matter the guise it takes.",

            "content": "Enough has been said about the plot and characters by now that I am only going to add a personal note...which I strongly feel I must. I had to wait for this movie to be released on DVD before I got to see it....having waited patiently since I first read it won awards at the Venice Film Festival.I am so grateful that Peter Mullen took this project on and that it met with such controversy because that was exactly what was needed for the film to get recognized and viewed by as many people as possible. The more people who see the film the better! The wonderful advantage of having waited for the DVD release is that it came with the brilliant documentary, \u0091Sex In A Cold Climate` which inspired the movie. As a X-Roman Catholic and a survivor of what I refer to as my incarceration...an oppressive Catholic education/indoctrination by the Sisters Of Charity (1957-1958) and the Ursuline Sisters (1959-1969), both old orders of the Catholic Church originating in Europe. I can state with battle-scarred alacrity that behavior as depicted in this movie is not only factual but not nearly cruel enough to tell the true story. From my experience...the Nazi's must have taken lessons in depravity and wickedness from the Sisters Of Charity! These were old world religious orders with dogmas and superstitions that have not changed since Christ's time. The practitioners of this primitive cult like barbarism were mostly ignorant of anything resembling reason or logic not to mention...science. The comparisons to the Taliban is not all that far fetched. Of course there was one or two nuns who had an occasional bout of compassion, but they were not only a minority, they were also downcast within the system. I also realize that not all Catholic orders are of the same cloth as the strict Roman Catholic variety, but I was born into the Irish Catholic variety...one of the worst.It took me years and a loving cheerful husband to undo the deep melancholia I felt from having grown up with this kind of repression. Now, as a middle aged adult my depression has amalgamated into a outspoken and healthy anger at a religious institution and church that has been allowed for millenniums to abuse it's power. The psychological methods employed by The Catholic establishment is so devoid of compassion and full of hate that had it still existed today in America it would be considered illegal. The only reason these zealot fanatics got away with their brutal treatment of innocent children for so long is because the people they tormented were brainwashed with eternity in hell for even thinking of questioning such God given authority. I spit on that authority! This movie is not an exaggeration! And it's not restricted to the religious orders in Ireland. If anything it didn't go far enough in depicting the true story. Not enough nefariousness has been said of an institution that routinely turned it's eyes on child molestation and the persecution of women perpetrated by it's leaders. I am so glad that all these Catholic Church and School survivors are suing the church and therefore bringing the atrocities to light. And I applaud Peter Mullen for making such a forceful case against inhumanity in the name of organized religion of any flavor. Christian, Catholic, Islam, Jew...they're all the same...it's all about control and power...and too often it's an aberration of it's original intent.",

            "review_title": "One of the better films of the year; Bergman goes to Ireland, you could say...",
            "content": "The Magdalene Sisters is one of the better movies of the year. It holds within it such emotional girth, such a sympathy with these girls and what they go through in such a society that holds the Catholic belief system as the absolute truth, that by the time you leave the theater, like it or dis-like it, you'll feel drained. Along with a heart-wrenching relentlessness by writer/director Peter Mullan in revealing the details of the nun's cruelty and coldness, there are a number of very good performances here. Geraldine McEwan's Sister Bridget, head Sister of the Magdalene reformatory, is on par with Nurse Ratched for being one of the most frightening of dominating female figures; Eileen Walsh's Crispina/Harriet is possibly the most touching of the lot of imprisoned women and could garner an Oscar nomination; Nora-Jane No one's Bernadette is a true balancing act between rebellious spirit and trapped creature; and the other players, including Anne-Marrie Duff and Dorothy Duffy add splendid supporting work.As fellow film connoisseurs know, Ingmar Bergman was renown for most of his films dealing with faith, the loss of it, and/or the absence of God and the pain that seeps through in living in such a world that doesn't question it. While these questions weren't as forward and evident in this film as they were in Bergman's masterpieces, often Mullan subtly brings these questions to light as the film progresses: if God is pounded over and over and over into these girl's heads, that they are here because they need to repent for their \"mortal sins\" (such as being raped, flirting, having children out of wedlock), and they are subjected to physical, sexual, and mental abuse by those who should be compassionate, life-long devotees to the faith, where is God? This question actually comes to a big head in a scene that at first shows itself to be rather amusing when a priest gets a poison Ivy rash, and then Crispina, who got it from him in the worst way, shouts out over and over 'YOU ARE NOT A MAN OF GOD!', and thus is silenced away to a mental asylum. Indeed, this is the part of the film where the question gets the most light, and it's the most harrowing scene in the movie among others and is one of the most powerful in movies this year. The only liability is the climatic ending to which is something against a Bergman=esque logic, and while I won't reveal it here, it tends to go to an (appropriate) timing that's akin to Cuckoo's Nest. Personally, I felt the film should have ended with the Bergman logic instead of the Kesey spirit, but that's neither here nor there, since the bulk of the film in and of itself is contains some passionate drama, and to those who see it will not only get an eye-opening view to the old-time (if old-time is up until seven years ago) Catholic ways, but also to the great dangers of control over human life.",

I attended a catholic school which was run by these social misfits, and from my very first day, I was persecuted for the following crimes: I had a short hair cut, my hand writing was not neat, I did not know the words to the Canadian national anthem, I had an English accent, I was good at drawing, I failed to smile at the right time during assembly, I slipped on some ice in the school grounds and hurt myself. etc., etc., etc. I was hit countless times during my few months there - before I left the horrible place. I was constantly referred to as \"the green horn Englishman\",mocked and imitated because of my accent, and belittled because I didn't know the Canadian national anthem, which we were required to sing every morning before lessons began - (I'd only been in the country weeks - I soon learned it). I was kept behind after school regularly because my handwriting was \"unacceptable\", causing me to miss my bus home (I had a long way to travel). I was once hit across the back of my head with the words \"you write like a boy, you talk like a boy - you even look like a boy\". I was eight years old. My sister, who was ten, received remarkably similar treatment. I was terrified to tell my parents because I thought they would speak to the nuns and I would be worse off. Instead they thankfully took my sister and me out of school after she admitted what was going on. I have nothing but contempt for these people.

Eileen Walsh should get a special award for an incredible performance as Crispina - Eileen, you are fantastic! I look forward to more from you! What shook me was the realization that this movie captured the interplay of Dickensian exploitation interwoven with the fascistic barbarity of the church. The laundry was a slave-plantation par excellence as it ground its physically, sexually and emotionally exploited slaves within an atmosphere of sheer terror and self-hatred - we deserve what we get because we are guilty - shame on us - this is what the masters of every plantation on this planet sought to instill in slaves. What I would have liked to see developed further was how this laundry-plantation fit within the wider Irish society - whose clothes were being washed, and what was their relationship to the people who were incarcerated here? Religion's role in the sheer brutalization of its adherents has been evidenced throughout history - no mass religion has brought anything other than terror, subjugation and self-hatred to women - this film proves it beyond doubt! As men, we are beneficiaries of such brutalities to women - and we are like Margaret's brother - who sheepishly mutters some nonsense about waiting to grow up while his sister lived in hell. What pained me most in this film was the terrible scene of uniformed men dragging Crispina out of the dormitory - to her destruction - and here the most painful part was noting that none of the women could shake off their terror to help their sister who cried for help. The scene captured in a brutal moment, the truth that tyranny can only thrive with our collective fear. Religion like other totalitarian ideologies rules by internalized terror. Enough, go on and watch this movie, its worth every tear you shed, because in the end, you will find that being disturbed makes you recognize the suffering of every Crispina, Margaret, Rose, Bernadette among us.",

            "content": "Based on true accounts and set in Ireland in the 1960's, three teenage girls are sent, against their will, to a convent for various reasons (pregnancy, rape, \"too pretty\"). The Magdalene Asylums, in existence until 1996, were not unlike the \"orphanages\" run by the Catholic Church in Qu\u00e9bec, during the Duplessis years. The inmates were treated as slaves, made to work in laundries and treated cruelly by those one could never imagine working in God's name.These unlucky girls, believers in the all-powerful Catholic church, suffer cruelty at the hands of nuns and brothers, often made to feel ashamed and of their sexuality, generating mental illness and self-loathing. The struggle, throughout the plot, is to make it out alive, despite the Asylum's religious roots to save prostitutes as early as the mid 1800's.This story, brilliantly acted, directed and written leaves virtually nothing to the imagination, which is intentional right from the beginning. The brutality is shown for what it is; in fact, one of the original \"inmates\" later described the movie as much worse in reality.At a loss for words, I do not have the eloquence to do this movie justice.

            "content": "I'm not going to act like a smarta** (like many of the other reviewers) attempting to rationalize the views and beliefs of the 19th century Irish and the influence of Catolicism on the society back then. Instead, I'm going to share my impressions of it, speaking as a casual observer: The first thing that comes to mind is... \"What the f***!?\" I mean, girls, can you imagine being sent to a place like The Magdalene Sisters for, erm, being pretty, flirting with guys, or being a single mother? No, really - WTF? It seems utterly ridiculous and inconceivable. What about your family disowning you and selling you into slavery if some bastard molested you? I guess if such twisted pseudo-religious extremism was in place today, 95% of today's' women would have to be confined to an asylum.I was quite bothered by the fact that Margaret's family chose to send her off to that awful place (after she was brutally raped by her cousin), instead of calling the rapist to justice and helping their daughter cope with the crime she fell victim to. I don't know what kind of religion condones rape, and, to add insult to injury, considers the *victim* a sinner. I can't imagine how brainwashed and f***ed up people back then must've been. A teenage girl is taken advantage of, yet SHE is the one being punished and getting disowned by her family, while the perpetrator (the rapist) just gets away with it and goes on as if nothing had happened. Where is the logic behind this, and what holy book preaches such \"morals\"? And Bernadette? She is confined to the asylum merely for the fact that she is moderately attractive and extroverted. This is just totally out of order, seriously.Speaking of Bernadette... she was, obviously, the highlight of the movie. I only wish she would've hit one of the despicable nuns as she and Rose (Patricia) were escaping.I also liked Anne-Marie Duff - the actress has a certain je ne sais quoi.The most tragic of all was certainly Crispina. It was clear from the start that she's not like the other girls - she's already broken beyond repair and her mental health issues are irreversible. It's no surprise that she perished at 24... and of anorexia! How sad indeed...The Magdalene Sisters asylum seemed like a devilish concentration camp rather than a religious organization. I don't think there was ever anything remotely \"Godly\" about an institution like that. Moreover, real-life survivors have reported that the conditions were actually much worse compared to those portrayed in the movie. Oh, the horror! It's an excellent movie, though. They couldn't have picked a better cast. I can't imagine anyone else playing Bernadette... well, anyone except for Sherilyn Fenn, who has exactly the same dark, sultry look. The other cast members were also chosen perfectly, and though none of them are mega-famous (in fact - most are relatively unknown), the performance surpasses that of well-known Hollywood stars by *miles*.Anyway, I was impressed with the movie, and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested in the subject matter.",

I could care less.This is a very moving, insightful and powerful film that brings to light a most shameful episode in the history of the Republic of Ireland and the Catholic Church. This film will make you angry. It will make you sad. It will make you ashamed that in the so-called developed world, such institutionalised abuse can take place with the full knowledge and acquiescence of the State, the Church and the general population, although I suspect many Irish people will profess ignorance of these events in much the same way as many Germans did of the concentration camps.If your knowledge of Ireland is confined to the glossy tourist brochure spiel of traditional pubs serving Guinness, folk music, rugged scenery and leprechauns, your illusions will be shattered, because this film strips away the veneer of \"quaint\" and exposes a much darker side that exists just below the surface. You will learn of a country where great swathes of the population are unquestioningly subservient to a Catholic Church that preaches piety but practises repression, cruelty, paedophilia, avarice and self-indulgence on an industrial scale. 30,000 Irish women were sent away to these institutions so the Church could make money from slave labour and many were kept imprisoned until they died. The last \"Catholic Laundry\" in the Republic of Ireland closed less than ten years ago, in 1996! Bravo to the people who made this film and to everyone connected with it. It is only by bringing such attitudes and practices to the attention of a wider audience that we can hope they will never be repeated.",

            "content": "The Magdalene Asylums and the treatment an estimated 30,000 'fallen' women is one of the great shames on the Irish nation and the Catholic Church, which the Irish government only apologised for in 2013. The British-Irish co-production of The Magdalene Sisters set out to tell the true story of a group of young women who suffered at the hands of the Church and their families.Starting in 1964, The Magdalene Sisters focuses on three women, Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff) who is raped by her cousin during a wedding, Rose (Dorothy Duffy) who had a child out of wedlock and was forced to give him up for adoption and Bernadette (Nora Jane No one), a teenage orphan who has the audacity to flirt with boys and is sent to the asylum, even though she is a virgin. At the asylum, each the woman all have to atone for their 'sins', through hard labour in the laundries, participating in prayer and can only be freed on the grace of the Mother Superior Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan).The Magdalene Sisters has a rape scene within the first five minutes sets the tone that this is going to be a bleak, hard-hitting drama about a truly appalling institution. Writer-director Peter Mullan felt this was a story that he needed to tell. Mullan does showcase the physical and mental abuse that these women went through, who were humiliated, dehumanised and used as slave labour. The nuns of this institution are made out to be sadists who use Catholic beliefs as a justification and a method of control on the women, while Mullan shows the hypocrisy of the church in its various forms.The Magdalene Sisters is mostly set in a small, claustrophobic environment and Mullan uses this microcosm to explore some wider psychological and sociological. The character of Katy (Britta Smith), a woman who had been in the asylum for 40 years, is so institutionalised, that she acts as an extra enforcer for the nuns, under the hope she can complete a pendant. All of the other women are completely rejected by their families and have to join the order because they have nowhere else to turn.When Mullan does take us outside of the asylum he portrays the conservative nature of Irish society at the time. The public look down the women when they are allowed out, seen as the lowest of the low, the state offering some complicity, as police occasionally help the nuns. On the other side of the coin, young men see the women of the asylum as easy because of their reputation for being 'whores' and 'sluts'.Each of the actors give their all for the film and they had given the heavy material. The film is blessed with a talented cast and for many of the actresses, The Magdalene Sisters is their biggest credit. The tragedy is played to the fullest, as these women suffer inside and outside the asylum, yet Rose and Margaret keep their kind aspects of their characters and Bernadette reminds a fiery woman who does not crack to the punishment she has received. In comparison the naive and kind-hearted Crispina (Eileen Walsh), a young woman with properly learning disabilities, who is abused in various forms and is the character who suffers the most.Mullan made an incredibly important film, looking at tragic historic story where many women suffered. This is a film that is furious towards the Catholic Church and Mullan does portray many hard scenes in physical and emotional abuse, filled with violence and nudity. It is a tough yet rewarding watch. But if you think the treatment the women suffered in this dreadful Mary-Jo McDonagh, a former Magdalene inmate said that the reality was even worst.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",

            "content": "\"The Magdalene Sisters\" is a stark Irish docu-drama, that recalls the Canadian \"The Boys of St. Vincent,\" a not dissimilar tale of shameful doings at a Roman Catholic institution well into the late twentieth century. \nThe difference is that \"Boys\" told a story of secret abuse by priests that was hidden until the adults the boys became were haunted enough to expose the horrors; in Ireland, the culture was complicit in the hiding away of girls and women who attracted male lust, such that not until the end are we told of the impact on the adults they became.  Based on a documentary, \"Sex in a Cold Climate,\" this film is like watching a Holocaust movie for its stark showing of prisoners subject to unremitting work and stifling of human spirit as it follows four very individual young women, before, during, and after. But the additional layer of horror is that the \"prison guards\" were pious nuns and manipulative priests and the girls' own families enthusiastically committed them to these hell holes for the rest of their lives as punishment for crimes ranging from flirting to rape to mental retardation.  When a girl's much younger brother contacts her, she screams, \"Where have you been for four years?\" He blusters in response: \"Growing up!\" When she snarls back, \"That's not a good enough answer!\" it serves as a metaphor of criticism for the entire country, let alone the Catholic Church.  What is missing is some context. We're told that the last of these institutions, that were set up throughout the country, didn't close until 1996 -- but was there any outcry over the years? What did it take for the country, and the Church, to grow up and to shut them down? How did the country, let alone the families, face up to this horrific treatment of women? For example, Regina Kunzel's book \"Fallen Women, Problem Girls: Unmarried Mothers and the Professionalization of Social Work, 1890 - 1945\" documents how American society over the past 150+ years viewed unwed mothers, from being victims of unbridled men to being temptresses. The Taliban's burkhas seem mild in comparison, but have the same purpose.Actor/director Peter Mullan provides no answers -- maybe Ireland still hasn't faced up to sex-- but he meticulously recreates a sordid situation in virtual black and white.",

            "content": "The \"Magdalene\" of the title has nothing to do with the famous Cambridge college. Rather, the film concerns what was, until recently, a little-known aspect of recent Irish history, the Magdalene Laundries or Magdalene Asylums. These were Roman Catholic institutions, originally founded in the 19th century, as homes for penitent \"fallen women\" (that being the contemporary euphemism for prostitutes). By the period when the film is set (the 1960s), their scope had greatly increased, and the great majority of their inmates were no longer former prostitutes. The laundries were used as quasi-penal institutions for any women, especially single mothers, whose sexual conduct offended against strict Catholic notions of morality.None of the three major characters in this film (all of whom arrive in the laundry on the same day) is a prostitute and only one, Margaret, is an unmarried mother. Rose was placed in the asylum because she was sexually assaulted by a relative and the family found this the best way of covering up the scandal. Bernadette was also placed there by her family, not because she was actually promiscuous but because she was felt to be too flirtatious with the local boys and therefore in \"moral danger\". Once inside the laundry, the girls are treated more or less as slaves, being forced to work long hours in exchange for starvation rations and accommodation in a Spartan dormitory. The idea is that hard work and suffering will purify the soul and lead to redemption, but the nuns who run the laundry seem more interested in the profits they can make from the girls' unpaid labour than they do in their spiritual welfare.There were several things that I found frightening about this film. The first is that the things it depicts could have happened at all. More frightening is that fact that the things it depicts happened, not in the remote past or in some totalitarian dictatorship, but in a Western European democracy in the second half of the twentieth century- the last Magdalene Laundry did not close until 1996- with the connivance of the authorities and of much of the population. The Ireland we see is a far cry from the Tourist Board stereotypes of leprechauns, Guinness, folk music and happy-go-lucky people.Perhaps the most frightening thing of all, however, is the suggestion that many of the inmates accepted their virtual enslavement by the system. The laundries do not form part of the official Irish penal system and their inmates have never been convicted of any crime for which they could lawfully be imprisoned. (When one girl attempts to escape she is dragged back to the laundry not by the police but by her outraged father, who regards her as having brought shame on the family). The nuns have no legal powers to detain these women against their will, and although the doors are kept locked at night, there are no armed guards or barbed wire which could foil a determined attempt to escape. Yet although Rose and Bernadette try to escape their captivity, and Margaret is eventually released by her brother, few of the others are willing to join them, and one even collaborates with the nuns in preventing escape attempts. The inmates are by no means all young- indeed, there are even elderly women who have presumably spent the greater part of their lives in the laundries. The implication is that the inmates are kept in the asylums less by physical coercion than by their own fears of what life will hold for them should they leave, by their sense of rejection by their families and by the guilt feelings which the nuns try to inculcate in them.There were two scenes which did not work for me. One was where the nuns force the girls to parade naked in front of them. The obvious overtones of this scene came, for me, too close to that old canard, beloved of those who combine religious prejudice with prurience, that nunneries are all hotbeds of lesbianism. The other was where the priest, suffering from a skin irritation, rips all his vestments off while the simple-minded Crispina repeatedly shouts at him \"You are not a man of God!\", a scene that would have been more at home in a surreal farce than a serious drama.The standard of acting, however, was uniformly high, even though few of the actresses involved are well-known. If I had to single any out for praise, it would be Nora-Jane No one as Bernadette, Eileen Walsh as the tortured Crispina and Geraldine McEwan as the frighteningly sadistic Sister Bridget. This is in many ways a harrowing film, with its depictions of cruelty and sadism, but it is a film well worth watching. At times I wondered if there was a hidden Unionist agenda- the film does nothing to dispel, and much to confirm, the standard Ulster Protestant view of Eire as a priest-ridden banana republic. Those who regard the film as anti-Catholic, however, should remember that cruelties of this nature are not something exclusive to Ireland, or to the Catholic church, but can occur whenever and wherever religious believers, of whatever creed, allow their faith to be distorted into an instrument of oppression. 7/10",

            "content": "The Magdalene Asylums were a group of sanctuaries set up in the 19th century to rehabilitate prostitutes, promiscuous young girls and orphans. Those set up in Ireland were run by Irish nuns and functioned as commercial laundries. The inmates washed clothes and the church got paid. The inmates themselves were subjected to intense psychological pressure, the \"washing of laundry\" becoming a form of spiritual penance (ie, wash these clothes and your sins shall be washed away).Despite their supposedly noble intentions, the Asylums functioned more like giant sweat shops than places of genuine rehabilitation. Like Nazi Concentration Camps, \"unworthy people\" were collected, institutionalised and made to work, the inmates the perfect workforce, providing huge amounts of profits and requiring no personal salary. Those who didn't comply were beaten, tortured, molested and stripped of their clothes.And yet the girls tolerated this treatment. They were coerced into seeing themselves as being \"spiritually unclean\", guilted into obediently tending to their duties in the hope that they may one day better themselves. Of course this very cycle of exploitation demonstrates how most religions work. Religion reduces man to a fallen organism and then constructs superficial rituals which he must dutifully perform in order to redeem himself in the eyes of God. In the Magdalene Asylums, religious exploitation is married to capitalist interests, guilt prostituted solely for commercial gains.Like \"Schindler's List\", the camp movie it most resembles, the film fails to examine why and how such blatantly cruel institutions were tolerated. How could this have happened? Were the nuns really cruel monsters? How could they have imagined themselves to be serving God whilst committing such blatantly unchristian acts? How could the surrounding populace collaborate in these barbaric practises? How could the state have permitted adult women to be held under lock and key without process of law? But the film is no more illuminating than Spielberg's portrayal of the Holocaust. The film ignores the fact that the ruling nuns were themselves once inmates. That they themselves were the victims of rape and sexual abuse. The film ignores the famine crisis that drove families to send their girls here. The film ignores the poverty of the populace and fails to examine the factors which led to the church drifting down such a dark path. Instead, the film is content to simply portray the asylums as factories of pain.So like \"Schindler's List\" there's an exploitative quality here, the film bludgeoning you with the sheer sensationalism of its material. Still, this is a tremendously well acted picture and almost consistently riveting. And while Spielberg's \"nuns\" are a group of infantilized Jews, director Peter Mullan populates \"The Magdalene Sisters\" with fully realised characters. 8/10 - Worth two viewings. Makes a good companion piece to Don Siegel's \"The Beguiled\" and Frederick Wiseman's \"Titicut Follies\".",

Here we have an extremely well constructed film that registers some of the pain involved There's one scene that will stick with you for weeks: a crazed nun uncontrollably beats a girls for speaking to an \"outsider.\" That outsider is the sister of an inmate who periodically brings the inmate's son by for a glimpse. The girl being beaten simply wanted to let the girl know her sister had been transferred to the loony bin for revealing a priest was raping her. This has power.Missing from the history the film gives is the fact that many of the detainees were victims of molestation and incest, still rampant today in Ireland. And all the nuns are drawn from the pool of detainees, which is why the nuns here are so damaged.But no movie exists outside of the context of other movies.

            "content": "The Magdalene Sisters chronicles the experiences of three young girls in the infamous Magdalene Laundries. The Laundries were Catholic clergy-run organizations in operation from the 19th century up until the late 20th century in Ireland. Girls were sent to work in these institutions for suspicion of having sex outside of marriage, showing provocative character, or for simply being \"too pretty\". Mullen succeeds in exposing the outright abuse that went on in these institutions at a time when the Church was seen to be Ireland's highest moral authority.The film focuses on the stories of three \"fallen\" girls who have all been landed in the Laundries for sins they didn't commit. What is most shocking about this film is the utter sadism and cruelty of the nuns who run the asylum. They force the girls to work beyond endurance in abysmal conditions, and routinely subject them to humiliation of an unthinkable nature. In one scene, the nuns line the naked girls up and judge who is the hairiest, who has the biggest breasts, etc. Mullen wanted the girls to appear natural, and insisted that the they not shave themselves or pluck their eyebrows prior to and during filming. No one is wearing make-up and all the girls wear the same unflattering garb. This adds to the realism of the film and brings his asylum closer to the real Laundries. The clever polarization of character personalities made for some interesting clashes. There is Bernadette, who is fiery and headstrong; Margaret, a responsible girl with a strong sense of morality. Rose, whose good nature endeared me quickly to her. And Crispina, who is just plain bonkers. I found the development of Margaret's character to be particularly interesting: The more oppression she is subjected to, the more she comes to value her independence. This all culminates until her brother finally comes to collect her after four years. Upon realising her newfound freedom, she wont even have her brother tell her to hurry so they can get going: \"Don't you dare tell me what to do! Don't you ever dare tell me what to do!\"Eileen Walsh was brilliant in this movie. Her portrayal of the simple but eccentric inmate Crispina certainly added a lot of colour to the film. Despite the obviously bleak theme, there are some humorous moments in the film and these usually involve Crispina. This was a very difficult role to take on, as Crispina's theatrical and over-dramatic personality required Walsh to portray such a wide array of emotions. So convincing was Walsh's performance that I found myself feeling real compassion for the girl. She's not all there and is virtually clueless about the world, which makes her fate all the more poignant. Walsh sacrificed vanity more than any of the other girls for this role, which is also to be admired. Her performance stood out for me as one of the highlights of the film.This film should appeal to the secular-minded and those who are critical of religion in general. I don't know if Mullen himself holds any biases in this area, but he certainly succeeds in highlighting just how detrimental an effect fundamentalism can have on a society. It has torn the girls' families apart, stripped them of their independence and, for some of them, has resulted is the considerable deterioration of their mental health. The girls enter the asylum as strong, healthy individuals who, over time, come to forget how to interact properly with other people and find it difficult to distinguish what is real and what isn't. One of the prevailing themes in The Magdalene Sisters is the hypocrisy of devout Christians, who claim to model themselves off of Christ, yet are so un Christ-like in their treatment of the \"fallen\" in society. This is especially true of the nuns, who are supposed to serve as women of Christ, yet fail to follow in his example of forgiveness and love.One aspect of this movie I found particularly interesting was its depiction how society viewed women in the era. The treatment of the Magdalene girls raises questions about the injustices and double-standards which existed in the early 20th century. Even though the girls of Magdalene are not at fault for being raped, getting pregnant or simply being attractive, it is the women who are punished and ostracised.The crew did a great job of recreating the atmosphere of the old Irish Laundries. Most of the film is shot in dimly lit conditions, to emphasize the bleak and gloomy feel of the place. We get a brief glimpse of the beautiful Irish countryside when Margaret steps outside the grounds of Magdalene and becomes disorientated as she surveys the outside world. She is startled by the light and beauty of freedom, which is in stark contrast to her confinement in the Laundries. Sound is also manipulated to great effect. I really got the feel of an old, spacious dank church as every sound is clearly heard resonating off the stone walls. I think the echo was supposed to simulate that constant feeling of being alone which pervaded the asylum.The shocking nature of this film may prompt the viewer who has had no prior knowledge of the Magdalene asylums to question how accurate a representation it is of the actual Laundries. Indeed, I myself found it hard to accept that the asylums could be this bad until I watched Steve Humphries' 1998 documentary \"Sex in a Cold Climate\", on which this film is based, and found the reality to be just as harrowing as the adaptation. In fact, one of the inmates told Mullen that the reality of the Laundry was much worse than what is depicted in the film.I really can't recommend this film enough. It was moving, entertaining, and shocking enough to hold my attention until the final credits rolled. Expect to have a seething hatred of Irish nuns instilled in you. 10/10",

He is a very focused filmmaker because he never derails from the main story. The sets are simplistic but quite effective. The convent has gives a feel of coldness and a suffocating claustrophobia. Mullan draws fine performances from his main cast. Geraldine McEwan is hateful and frightening as the headnun. The four leads, Anne-Marie Duff, Dorothy Duffy, Nora-Jane No one and especially Eileen Walsh perform naturally. Many films are being sold using the tag 'Based on True Events'. Yet, that itself does not guarantee a great film. Fortunately this is not the case with 'The Magdalene Sisters' which truly is a relevant film.

            "content": "Peter Mullan's The Magdalene Sisters is the harrowing depiction of what has been reported to have actually happened to a handful of young women during their incarceration at a religious convent in staunch, Catholic-ridden 1960's Ireland. Like most of the films I find are the most involving, it is a piece which seems to have come about out of its makers' stumbling across a news story; a news story of not too long ago in which a chilling narrative is very easily ecked out of stark foundations involving grounded people placed in extraordinary situations and made to suffer. We recall that Iranian director Jafar Panahi produced his 2006 film, Offside, from similar foundations; that of an article he read, and like The Magdalene Sisters, it was a tale of gender discrimination as well as how a system overreacted to an event which might otherwise have been dealt with less imperiously.The reason for hopping over to the Middle East like that lies with the fact what unfolds at the core of this drama, made four years earlier in 2002, isn't too dissimilar in mentality nor peer response. The popular stereotype (although like most of its kind, grossly misjudged) of the Irish people from back in the day from a British slant is one of backwardness and benightedness. Furthermore, a popular view on the laws and rules that govern the people of nations such as Iran and those akin to it by that of The West nowadays is one of a similarly feeble and dismissive nature. Panahi took the idea of a woman forbidden from attending football and plunged a central character into the cauldron of such a thing; going on to spin a tale out of the sheer ridiculousness of the rules in amusing fashion. In one scene, the film effectively reduces their tyrannical ideas to a mere two handed comedy routine running on an undeniable element of farce when one girl already caught tries to get the nearby guard to play out a running commentary as he watches on through a slat in the wall.Therein Mullan's film lies a tale about young women having their freedom taken away from them; whose choices, at still a young and some would say premature age, are scorned upon without a moment's thought and dealt with in a way that would have you think they have committed a crime along the lines of murder. The film follows an array of characters but is without a definitive central lead, the film more-a-depiction of collative sufferings and hardships shared by that of four girls. They are Margaret (Duff); Rose (Duffy); Harriet (Walsh) and Bernadette (No one) - the most radiant of these being that of No one's Bernadette, whose screen presence and the way she comes across on the screen gives off a fascinating sense of both individualism, sexiness, and vulnerability whenever she is present. They each have their own respective introductions, but these are constructed as if the girls are would-be members of one of The Magnificent Seven, or perhaps even a team of commandos in some old war B-movie who're found; rounded up and then reprimanded so as to be thrust into a melting pot of hostilities and conflict.Our characters are banded together and lumped as one in a covenant-come-institute run by a number of nuns, a covenant so prison-like and unforgiving in its nature that we expect searchlights; sirens; yapping guard dogs and other general mise-en-scene associated with prison camps to rear up when an early sequence depicting an inmate putting into action an escape plan unfolds. The girls are there on account of their insubordination born out of a variety of actions more broadly linked to sin, lust and sexualised altercations; that is to say, the indulging in said activities, or activities along these lines, to a point that the powers-that-be consider it a breach of threshold. In the aforementioned Iran and other such places, a woman can be stoned to death if it means she was found guilty of marital indecency. Here, one girl is jumped in the aftermath of a wedding party by a male cousin who quite likes the look of her, and after grassing on him, SHE is the one dragged off to what is essentially a correctional facility as punishment.Harriet and Rose are there out of the fact they had children born out of wedlock, be assured that any contact with the new born has to be made strictly under the radar of authority. Bernadette winds up at the facility on account of the pleasures she garners from being the centre of all the boy's attention whilst static in the playground, a status and its illegality epitomised by a composition over Bernadette's shoulder from her front which blurs out the busy activity of all the other girls at her orphanage as they move around reiterating just alienated she is from standardised feminine behaviour. The film as a whole is a triumph; a reminder that while we're all off policing other nations and educating them on how western methods and the like are superior to certain others', it wasn't so long ago that certain western nations themselves were implementing harsh, unremitting punishments unto that of their own. Catholicism is one of the most popular religions in the world; here in this chapter of its existence, it lets itself down and it is to the film's credit that this is brought to our attention at a time when one of the world's other more predominant religions, Islam, is receiving a dressing down on account of their own inferior ways of dealing with minority groups as well as the female gender.",

Any rebellion will be dealt with physical and corporeal punishment, and for the most serious cases that would transpire outside, the girl will be locked up in some mental institution to die there under medical surveillance, is that care? Period. The point is that we are speaking of Ireland in the 1960s-1980s. They will say it is catholic, so it does not concern the countries where catholicism does not have any dominant power any more. But think of Poland and the permanent and regressive \"debate\" there since the end of communism about abortion. Then they will say it is marginal, only two or three countries in the world. Is it so? Is sexual freedom totally accepted for women, and that implies the women have the right to sexually do what they want with their bodies? But think of other sexual groups and how they are victimized in some of our countries, even France, Great Britain and the USA where a gay pride covers up a lot of discrimination. The film thus is extremely disturbing and frightening, especially since it is based on entirely true cases and the total figure of that victimization of women (one raped, the other one who only smiled at boys with a railing between them, and the third one pregnant and giving birth to a child) is several tens of thousands. A film that should be shown and discussed in all its details in all schools in our countries with kids between 14 and 16.

The film primarily focuses on Margaret, Bernadette, Rose and Crispina, girls who, for reasons that were either ridiculous or merely wrong, (but all horrible in their way) are sent to `do their time'.  One is a girl who was raped by her cousin at a wedding, and when she told, was immediately shipped off.   Another was an orphan who had grown up in the orphanage and was sent away because she was attracting outside boys with her beauty.  The other two were unwed mothers.  Regardless of the reason, all of the girls at the asylum are mistreated, forced to work like slaves in a laundry while the asylum profits from their work, are humiliated, beaten and some are raped by a local priest.  While all of the nuns who preside over the asylum are more than willing to participate in these activities, the one who sits at the head of the table is Sister Bridget, a nun who makes Nurse Rached look like someone who is just in a slightly bad mood. \n`The Magdalene Sisters' is strong on emotion and character development but the story, also written by Peter Mullan, is just average.  I couldn't help but think that they chose to focus on the four most extremely sympathetic girls, (nothing in the film or screenplay negates this idea, that I could come up with) and therefore is simply pushing the horror instead of letting it develop for the viewer, all for a more dramatic result.  Most `average' films can get away with this, but I expect more from `The Magdalene Sisters' because it had so much more potential.  Of course, this was not the deal breaker for me \u0096 it simply turns what could have been a three and a half star film into a three star film for me.  `The Magdalene Sisters' is helped by its strong cast (all of the actresses were unknown to me and did quite a good job) and the script insofar as its character development and its pacing.  While the girls they choose to focus on are surely quite sympathetic, their character development, particularly that of Margaret, is impressive.  The end of the film does have one bizarre freeze frame that I actually chuckled at (certainly not a response you want to garner during a horrifyingly intense film) but all said, it is definitely an above average film.  I definitely would not recommend it to anyone who is looking for a laugh, because other than the weird freeze frame thing, I didn't laugh once \u0096 this is a drama through and through, and not an easy one at that. \n--Shelly",

At points during the film I had to look away in disgust at what these nuns were putting these poor girls through, and all just to have a laugh. Very immoral. Maybe that perspective is from a Protestant background, but anyone who has seen such evil would most likely say the same.I have grown up believing that the nuns and the Catholic church were of a mighty power that the law was even unable to touch. But with recent allegations involving the church, they have seemed to change their wicked ways, at least for the eyes of the law. The Magdalene houses were much like prisons and the nuns ran these homes with more ferociousness and fear than most wardens run a prison. For a while, the church was the law. Immoral or not, they did so.The girls were locked within their rooms, like prisoners, but at least prisoners are paid for their work; these girls were also held against their will and forced to work, like slaves. An illegal action. This was not how the church saw the problem, they saw this as the girls washing away the demons and evil they brought on themselves. When one girl had the chance to escape, she did not. Why? I think that she felt the world was too much for her to handle, and maybe it was easier to stay in the house. As the narrator states in \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" the walls that confine you for time become the walls that make you not want to leave.The anguish consumed by the women in this place is catastrophic, to the point of suicide. An offense to God, but seems to be the only escape. A sad life to lead. The cruelty shelled out by the nuns is reminiscent of a Nazi concentration camp during World War Two, where the victim is face to face with the enemy at all turns. When the women do try to escape, their punishment is certain, a beating more fierce than the last. Death sounds like the perfect escape.Without a doubt, redemption shall come at last. When the young woman is released into her brother's custody at the end of the film, she stands her ground to the nuns, who are stubborn as well. Finally, these horrible places of cruelty and evil were closed in the late twentieth century. The law and morality prevail, while the church is again under fire. While i am a Judaeo-Christian believer, I can not fathom the idea of the church holding these women against their will.While examining this film, I could only think that I am glad that this period of the church is over. The film seemed so much like a cross between \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and \"The Da Vinci Code,\" a religious mystery buried deep within the walls of Magdalene houses. The power of the church was to fall to the power of the people. The people though are the power that keeps the church going, so it was bound to happen.",

It's an unflinching, powerful look at religious and sexual hypocrisy.\nIt's about Ireland's infamous Magdalene Asylums, where young Catholic girls were sent for various sexual \"sins\" and were condemned to beatings, horrible living conditions, and slave labor for sometimes the rest of their lives. They were told that this was the only way to wash their souls clean and get into heaven. Set in 1964, the movie starts with very short separate episodes about how each of the 3 main characters, Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff), Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone) and Rose (Dorothy Duffy) were sent there. Margaret was raped by her cousin but it was her that was punished, Rose shamed her family by having a baby out of wedlock, and Bernadette, incredibly, was sent merely for lightly flirting with some boys outside the walls of her orphanage.\nThe girls become friends and support each other under the cruel, mentally and physically abusive nuns and priests, and try to escape. The last few minutes of this movie are some of the most suspenseful I've seen.\nThere aren't any even remotely sympathetic authority figures in this movie, and I can tell you that I've never wanted to physically harm a movie character more than I did Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan), a sadistic old hag who seems to enjoy nothing more than punishing and beating the girls for the slightest infractions. But I don't think the movie is one-sided. In a place like this, the situation IS one-sided. It's hard to believe this kind of thing was happening in 1964; the places are little more than medieval torture chambers. But it's a true story.

Not since seeing `Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys' have I lost this much sleep about my tumultuous affair with the Pope's world.In 1960's Ireland began a reign of terror for thousands of young Irish girls who were shuffled off to reside and work at the so-called Magdalene Asylums, a thriving laundry business run by the Sisters of Mercy.  These tough nuns are depicted in `Magdalene Sisters' as martinets bent on removing even the hint of the devil from girls who have been sent there for sins ranging from flirting to fornicating, with giving up newborn babies the usual punishment/remedy.Mullan tells the story by focusing on three unfortunates who are sent against their wills but with the complicity of their families. `Abandonment' is not too strong a word. Mullan makes the girls as plain as possible but pretty in a non-Hollywood way. They are either slowly going insane from the rigid Dickensian workhouse, or they are obsessed about escaping, an act fraught with danger and impossibility.The film belongs to Geraldine McEwan's Sister Bridget, a cold-hearted Mother Superior who verbally and physically abuses the girls over trifles.  McEwan plays her in the Louise- Fletcher Nurse Ratched tradition by keeping the sneering to a minimum, thereby ratcheting the terror up notches with the slightest understated response. McEwan deserves an award for playing the inscrutable sister closest to my recollection of terrifying nuns.The Sisters of St. Joseph who programmed me for a lifetime of obedience to authority and sexual misunderstandings were not the same extreme disciplinarians as Mullan, who may be overstating the case against the nuns. My sisters' rigorous education helped me obtain a Ph.D., and their mental torture extended only as far as standing me up in front of the sixth-grade class to accuse me of being a `dirty thing' for holding a girl's hand.  Yet Mullan has caught the fear I felt for my soul and my inability to avoid punishment even for my thoughts. To a girl who protests, `I've never been with any lads ever,' Sister Bridget simply responds, `But you'd like to, wouldn't you?' Even the smallest natural affliction is a playground for torture: As one unfortunate girl in this film is advised by another about her post-natal painful breasts, \"The nuns go crazy if they see ya leakin'.\"The Taliban has reminded us recently that oppression of the weak is a constant human stain; Peter Mullan has brilliantly reinforced that truism.",

We are informed at the end of the film that more than 30,000 girls were sent to these `Magdalene laundries' before they were finally shut down in 1996.  The film, set in1960's Ireland, is yet another stinging indictment of religious fanaticism run amok. The three youngsters who are the story's focus are Margaret, a girl who is raped by her own cousin; Bernadette, a pretty girl who flirts a little too obviously with the boys hanging around the orphanage where she lives; and Rose, a young woman who had the misfortune of producing a child out of wedlock.  For their `crimes,' all three girls are spirited away and deposited in this religious hellhole, where for many years they are forced to perform ceaseless labor, are abused both physically and psychologically, and are deprived of compassion, freedom and hope.  Writer/director Peter Mullan approaches his subject matter with unwavering bluntness, not fearing to point the finger of blame exactly where it belongs \u0096 on the Catholic Church hierarchy who allowed this sort of unenlightened sadism to go on in the name of Jesus and religion.  Not surprisingly, the Catholic Church did not want this film to be either made or distributed.   For that reason alone, the movie demands to be seen.In a way, `The Magdalene Sisters' isn't as much a character study as it is a docudrama chronicling the abuses the girls are forced to undergo.  Despite excellent performances from all the actresses involved, we don't get to know much about each of their characters as individuals other than the fact they suffer unendurably.  Bernadette is probably the most fully developed of the three, but the polemical nature of the film precludes our getting to know really too much about her (or the others).  As the camp commandant \u0096 er I mean Mother Superior \u0096 Geraldine McEwen is chillingly brilliant, turning her character into an implacable tower of authority, a petty dictator ruling over the lives of her helpless charges.`The Magdalene Sisters' functions as a much needed expose of this kind of institutionalized abuse which we can assume still goes on in many places and in many forms in the world today.

Is a film that, in spite of years, cant be ignored as a teach of the past that can be applied to the present. Is a movie that, in spite of treat a so discussed topic as the religion, do it in a great, powerful and respectful way.\"The Magdalene Sisters\" are based in the real stories of a lot of women who was confined in a laundry called \"The Magadalene Sisters\", and how was be controlled by the Catholic religion in a unconventional way. The confined women were been treated in horrible ways, attempting their dignity and, practically, their lives itself. The story here in movie talk us about three women: Margaret, Rose and Bernardette. All of them, condemned by their families, which are too controlled with that wrong Catholic mentality. Against their will, they go to the famous laundry to heal they sins. But here the life is not nice. Bernardette is decided to scape. \"The Magdalene Sisters\" or its Spanish title \"Las Hermanas de la Magdalena\", is a strong movie, not for their violent content, is for its moral and social content. It is not any critic to believes, its a critic about abuse and practice of the religion, what, if is practiced in this way, is not more than contradictory.In other side, all the performances here are perfect, really believable: Anne-Marie Duff as Margaret, Dorothy Duffy as Rose and Nora-Jane No one (Beautiful, just beautiful) as Bernardette. There is too another important and memorable character: Crispina, performed perfectly by Eileen Walsh, a young woman who is abused and represents the weakness of the persons that surrender to this practices with undesirable consequences.Directed and written by Peter Mullan, \"The Magdalene Sisters\" is one of the most powerful films made lately that teaches about the errors of the past, which in this days, they are more necessary ever.*Sorry for the mistakes... well, if there any.",

            "content": "Peter Mullan's first effort, the moody and overlooked \"Orphans\" (1997) had raised the inkling that this British actor was fearless to construe thorny topics. In \"Orphans\", how did grown-ups react to the death of their mother? \"The Magdalene Sisters\" (2002) continues in this direction and well beyond since it deals with the Irish catholic convents where thousands of women were locked up (sometimes unfairly like the three main heroines in Mullan's flick) because they were considered as sinners according to the premises of catholic religion. For the second time, Mullan directs his camera where it hurts and calls upon the sensibility of the audience to make her realize the proximity in time of the true story he tells to our era (1964 and the last convent closed down in 1996) and to inform her of a terrible truth (30 000 women died in these prisons. They're data which send shivers down our spine and the contents of the film has strong echoes with what happens in certain Muslim countries in which women remain withdrawn into silence, are maltreated and can't have access to speech.Peter Mullan doesn't pull his punches to recount what happened behind the walls of these convents and plunges us in the heart of this daily hell experienced by these feminine inmates. The terrible customs and manners present a strong analogy with the British workhouses in the nineteenth century where men and women had to live and work together in appalling conditions. A hundred years later in these Irish prisons-convents, all the young women have to wear a brown uniform, have to work hard for an elusive wage, are badly fed, are physically and psychologically broken, are deprived of liberty and brainwashed. They even can't communicate between themselves. In this nightmarish universe, each glimmer of hope is dwindled and precedes an increasingly harsh sentence. The only possible exits are death, suicide. Even when there's an unexpected opportunity to flee (one of the three heroines who see an open door leading to escape and liberty), the exterior world scares because it's unknown. Madness and inhumanity also wait around the corner. The former won't spare poor Crispina while the latter waits the right moment to invade Bernadette. The loss of identity also ominously lurks: \"We have already a girl called Rose. Your second name is Patricia, your name will be Patricia\".To maintain discomfort to the viewer, Peter Mullan chose a derivative but absorbing directing without exaggerated effects, wan lighting, dour colors which weave a suffocating aura, close to a \"in camera\". Symboles are also his forte: a close-up of Bernadette's eye surrounded with blood after she had her hair cut: she struggles hard to keep her identity and to stay alive. Basically, Peter Mullan is an actor who has worked with Ken Loach. He kept from his mentor, a committed side to sympathize with the victims' plight. Mullan also doesn't think twice before denouncing cruel and unfair behaviors which follow this Irish Christian fundamentalism, from the institutions as well as the families. In this society, man is a tyrant, woman is submissive. But his targets also include guilty pleasures of some priests, the traffics of church, abuses and intolerance of a ruthless leading system in which there is no place for sympathy and pity. All this with a certain vehemence and an acute sense of detail: at meal times, Mullan shots the food and the money of the managers nuns in fleeting but notable close-ups.Maybe the end takes the easy way: the three heroins succeed without major difficulty to get out of this hell but it can be performed as a palatable sign of hope for the closing down of these prisons. However, the epilogue of the end is here to recall that if these places don't exist anymore, the survivors carry ineffaceable scars in their minds.Like in his first vehicle, Mullan chose to direct comparatively unknown actors. He shots his three main actresses with a certain modesty and one should praise their renderings: it takes guts to play such demeaning parts. The aficionados of Peter Mullan have probably noted that the director has a fleeting but fundamental apparition in his work: he acts this monstrous father who takes his daughter back with all his strength to this prison and pronounces these unworthy words:\" you're all alone in the world, you have no father, no mother...\" Is there a more eloquent way from a director to illustrate his purposes even if it incommodes the spectator? Denounciation and information are Mullan's two weapons and taps them to produce an excruciating but momentum film, a harrowing plea for the liberty of expression and the equality of sexes, a shattering homage to the victims. It's here to recall us that the freedom of expression is like drinking water on this planet: it's rare and priceless: let's protect it even if \"the Magdalene Sisters\" requires a strong stomach and the last shot of Crispina will certainly be too much for some people.NB: I know it's extraneous with the topic but Kevin Shields, the former leader of \"My Bloody Valentine\" acts one of the musicians during the wedding, a prime sequence. Mr Shields, the fans of \"My Bloody Valentine\" are still waiting a sequel to the flawless \"Loveless\" (1991). The title of this ground breaking record could suit very well to qualify the aura which reigned in the Magdalene convents...",

This is not done in a pornographic way. These girls are shown to be victims of circumstance.

(or any Dickens or Bronte story) look like a quaint nursery by comparison.All of the girls have had a run-in with either their parents or authorities and are sent to mend their ways at a convent run by GERALDINE McEWAN. McEwan is famous now for her Jane Marple impersonation in those newer Agatha Christie TV adaptations but here she's a terror as the sweet looking nun inflicting harsh punishments on the girls at the slightest infraction. It's no wonder that one of the girls goes mad, tries to hang herself when she loses her St. Christopher medal, and is eventually hauled off to the madhouse screaming bloody murder.The girls are no cardboard characters. Each one of them is vividly portrayed and it's fascinating to wonder what will happen next, as the story takes unpredictable turns and keeps you on the edge of your seat.Brilliantly acted and directed, it seems to have had little exposure in the U.S. but has won several international awards.It certainly paints a brutal picture of organized religion and the fanatical beliefs that can brainwash the simple minded. McEwan's performance here is an example of what power does to corrupt those in charge.Based on true incidents and persons, there are end credits that tell what happened to four of the principal girls afterwards, at least a few of them making happy adjustments.Difficult to watch, but thoroughly engrossing from start to finish.",

What is truly heartbreaking is the venal corporal punishments they received at the sadistic hands of the nuns who ran the self-made cleaning facility (the girls would scrub laundry for the locals) and the film focuses on a handful of wrongfully imprisoned girls (one for an illicit pregnancy, another for being raped by a cousin and made the mistake of confiding her attack, one for being feeble minded and one simply for blossoming into a raving beauty). Excellently acted by relative newcomers and bluntly directed showing the scathing warts-and-all depiction of a hellish life on earth establishment that housed some 30,000 women over its nearly 100 year existence (ending ironically in 1996 when the primitive machinations were deemed obsolete). McEwan embodies the most sadistic 'caretaker' since Louise Fletcher in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'). One of the year's best films.",

It criticised the film for not suggesting that there would be even a vestige of spirituality in some of the Sisters (which I think would have made it an even more powerful film), but pointed out that since its release not even one single person from the Laundries had come forward to defend them.

I had heard of them before because of a song that Marianne Faithful performed with The Chieftains.  It is a heart-breaking song and her voice is typically sorrowful, but this film multiplies that degree of sorrow by a power of 10. I really was absolutely heartsick watching it.  I think the most stark scene, emotionally, was when the women were all lined up in the bathroom and the two nuns were commenting on which girl had the smallest breasts, largest breasts, etc.  You could nearly see the womens' life seeping out of them. It was truly dreadful to watch, yet you couldn't pull your eyes away.  It was also painful to see that girl who became more and more mean to the point that she even kept a necklace from another girl, for whom the necklace was a symbol of her bond with her son.  This girl seemed to be mentally diminished too, which made the treatment all the crueler.  It was really brutal. This is just a sad chapter in Catholic history that the church must face up to and mustn't object to its portrayal.  The sooner they face up to what they did, the quicker they can get over it.  Until then, we are left with the painful, harmful by-products of their treatment of women who were guilty only of submitting to a momentary weakness of the flesh.  It was sad that some of the women were promised that they would be allowed to leave when the vast majority would live out their lives there.  It was also sad that the only grounds necessary to be released from the Laundries were for a family member to permit them to come home.  And even given that that was the only condition that would allow them to leave, only one girl leaves at the request of family.  The whole film is just very very sad.  The presentation of this whole sordid affair is done factually, which only serves to re-enforce the venality and hypocrisy of the nuns.  Truly bracing and powerful film.  One that reveals the sad moral myopia which the nuns adhered to.  Rather than considering the example of Christ, these women keep the law as Pharisees did.",

If I have any complaint at all, it is that some of the horror of the times in the laundries was not depicted.  A lot of these girls had been victims of incest and/or abuse by the clergy. Some of the criticisms of the film have come from ignorance, I believe. The nuns who ran these institutions had often been victimized themselves. I personally knew one who was a piano teacher but who was \"punished\" for this gift by \"offering\" up this talent for her sins and put in charge of one section of the laundry where her hands became cracked and bleeding, never to touch piano keys again. I am sure the stories of other nuns in these institutions would give an understanding of why they were so bitter and twisted. Not to make allowances for the cruelty they perpetrated but to draw more depth to their characters. As for the girls, I was a witness to their incarceration as I was part of a group that would go to the convent and entertain them a few times per year. We were told they were bad girls who made the Blessed Virgin cry and not to talk to them but to sing our edifying hymns for them and try not to stare. We had no idea of what the \"badness\" was. Sitting through this movie was gut wrenching for me, realizing this was all going on at the time I was a young and privileged convent girl in my own world, completely unaware of what was being done to these innocents. The performances were beautifully done and I also admire how Peter caught the savour of the era with the muted colour of the film throughout. Historically framed but also immediate. Not to be missed by anyone and I understand one out of four Irish people have seen it. And yet there is a silence about what happened then. No one spoke to the plight of at least 30,000 women who were indentured slaves. 8 out of 10 for the courage and conviction of shedding floodlights on this and honouring the victims so profoundly.

Later, in the mid-nineteenth century the Church, in a alliance with the State, took them over. The goals were to continue providing services to \"lost women,\" cover the costs through the work regime, and provide a social service to the State. In this arrangement, nuns, the lowest members of the Church hierarchy, served as the front line workers, and were no more party to the shaping of the institution, and its expanded client list, than were the rescued women they served.So, there were three forces behind the Catholic Magdalene houses: the prostitute users and rapists who created the inmates, the State which hid both sexual license and its victims, and the Church which gained communal and moral sway.\"The Magdalene Sisters\" snuffs this broader context, choosing to see the oppression and suffering through the reductive lens of personal sexual repression. The nuns are not viewed in any sense as co-victims or sisters to their charges but as authoritarian, sadistic old maids. Though they work from dawn until dusk with house, factory, and prayer work, their lives are viewed as hypertrophied. Even in their only human moment during the communal viewing of \"The Bells of St. Mary,\" they quickly revert to their stepmother harshness. That sexual repression owns their actions, determines their person is specifically underscored in the villainous stripping game they force on the inmates, as if they were male screws in a women's prison.If one had to choose the dominant symbols of sexual repression in western culture today, nuns, priests, women, and Catholic Ireland would no doubt first come to mind. \"The Magdalene Sisters\" pushes all these buttons--and sparks the film with some sexual scenes and sexual fun and games to boot.The sex abusive priest exists in the same mold as the young rapist at the Catholic-ridden music event. Their acts are not so much the problem as is their sexual repression born of a puritanical Irish Catholicism. What the priest suffers for his act is a prank which divests him of layers of hypocritical clothing. The laughable strip tease is no doubt more popular and desirable to a modern audience than some \"politically correct\" form of public justice. But the exculpation of criminal acts is still in place, as it is in the case of that same violent rapist lad--to whom nothing at all happens.Anyway, when the girls enter the gate, we're supposed to believe that their persecution begins right then. The world they have left behind (run by and for men) goes scot free, but the world they enter, a women's world, is a prison. The Sisters of Mercy are the torturers. And Mother Superior is the unbending warden, while nuns young and old, having suppressed all kindness, understanding and intelligence, are the merciless screws. Their incarceration techniques are are so effective that the State has washed its hands of its supervisory role.The social context is replaced by the private narrative. The political is psychologized. Women are pitted against women. Freud's myth of sexual repression, so powerfully adhered to in Hollywoodland, displace sexual license, and the State's/Church's central role in protecting it.In sum, Christ, a man, can understand Mary Magdalene; the Sisters of Mercy, working in the Magdalene homes, and all women, cannot.

The reason for this preoccupation with women's sexuality is not hard to understand from a biological point of view: The female has little doubt that her child is hers (unless there is a freak situation, like a mess up of the babies at the maternity); the male instead wants to be sure that his offspring is really his, otherwise he would be wasting his resources on another male's child (I wonder how DNA tests for a child's paternity, only recently available, will change this equation in the long term). So different societies have try different methods to try to assure that young females stay chaste, whether it is through chastity belts, the use of veils and other sorts of clothing in order to cover the body, stoning adulterous women, so called \"honor crimes\", religious teachings that emphasize modesty since childhood, etc. If we are to believe this movie, in mid 20th century Ireland they come up with a novel solution to this problem: every young woman that showed (even minor) signs of sexual promiscuity was sent by her family to a convent, where she would spent most of her time washing other people's clothes (so as a way to \"wash\" her sins) under the watch of sadistic money-grubbing nuns. This film is too angry with this situation to become effective. It has also some very dubious scenes, the most notorious being one in which the women stand naked in a line being mocked by the dreadful nuns in charge (this scene wouldn't be out of place in an exploitative women's prison movie, a genre that this film comes dangerously close to). One of the few redeeming features of this film is the young actresses earnest, serious performances in a movie that sometimes seems keen in humiliating them.",

The \"Magdalene Sisters\" is a powerful film which follows the unhappy experiences of three such women as it peers grim-faced into the use and abuse of one of many institutions which perpetrated unspeakable evil in the name of righteousness. Well directed, well acted, and well received by critics and public alike, \"The Magdalene Sisters\" should prove a provocative watch for most, especially those interested in women's issues. (B)",

Supposedly the horror of the catholic run laundries ended in 1996, although Mullan left some doubt in a recent interview when he said there were rumors of their existence in Poland.  We should all pray every night for this to be pure rumor as the horror presented in this film are beyond any I have ever read about.  The 3 lead characters are Margaret, Bernadette and Rose (played wonderfully by Anne-Marie Duff, Nora-Jane Noone and Dorothy Duff respectively).  Their families and society deem them \"guilty\" of the mortal sins of being raped, having a child out of wedlock and being a \"temptress\" to boys.  This may seem far-fetched for teens of this generation, however this is based during their parents childhood - not so long ago! My only issue with the film is the plot shift from the protaganists to the story of Crispina (played chillingly by \"Nicholas Nickelby\" actress Eileen Walsh). Without question her story is sad and harrowing, but it takes the focus off of the 3 young ladies that we get to know during the first 45 minutes of the movie.  Just a minor complaint. Overall this is a very affecting movie that takes many liberties with the story line and might have done a better job of portraying the nuns as closer to human and providing an even more powerful story.  Still, 2 days later, I am still sickened by what I saw and the thought that it could still be going on somewhere - robbing innocence, dignity and life.",

A story of how organized religion destroys the lives and psyches of several young women who were punished for their \"sins\". Being raped by one's cousin is one of those \"sins\". So (I hope) you see, this is not an easy film experience... The \"sinners\" are sent to work at a laundry run by even-more-brainwashed nuns, who have bought into the ideology so much (and have probably been on the receiving end of so much more abuse), that they want, nay, need to punish these new sinners in any way possible.Hypocrisies abound in this brilliant, well-crafted movie.

Period.But let me give you the cons: 1) the story is exaggerated: while every single episode may be likely or even true, the way they are put together makes the story doubtful; 2) characters lack depth, especially the sisters: they seem one-dimensional puppets, who don't have any traits except their main vice (be it greed, sadism, stupidity and so on); 3) photography is always dull, surely in order to give you the feeling of a prison. But in the few scenes outside the prison it's dull all the same, so maybe something is wrong; 4) there's no attempt to give a critical appraisal: the movie simply piles it on. The director looks like he doesn't care for your mind, he simply wants to hit you in the stomach. And he gets there all the time; 5) last but not least, the story is so schematic that it is misleading and ideological: nothing is good in the world of the movie. Church=bad, males=bad, society=bad. It's the kind of bad propaganda we could hear in Cold War years.One is led to wonder what another director could have done with such shocking material: the fate of those 30.000 victims of ignorance and prejudice should have deserved something more.

No one would have known about what went on, had it not been because of the uproar caused by the victims coming forward to stir up our conscience about what they went through.There is an Irish play where this same situation is depicted on stage. Unfortunately, I don't remember the title. It was presented by the Irish Rep Company in New York a few years ago and dealt with the same situation. That was a gripping drama about cruelty, but The Magdalen Sisters is right there in the portrayal of how the nuns in this particular congregation mistreated the young women whose only crime was their rebellion against the Irish society of the 50s and 60s.One wonders if anything has come out in Ireland about these misdeeds, as we, in America, have heard from victims of sexual abuse in recent years, as they are no longer afraid to confront the church that would not have acknowledged its own evils, if these same persons had not come out forward to accuse the Catholic church that chose to hide its shame and never own up to its role in the sexual misconduct of their priests, or nuns, in this case.In this story, the abused are young girls. The three principals, Margaret, Bernadette and Rose, land in the convent of the Magdalene Sisters, which is run by Sister Bridget, who in turn, become the young women's worst nightmare. This Sister Bridget is a study in cruelty. She could not care less about the fate of the ones she's supposed to supervise. She is only concerned in making money from the laundry operation by enslaving these unfortunate women who for one reason, or another are sent to the convent to atone for sins they have not committed by their own families.Geraldine McEwan's portrayal of the evil Sister Bridget is a study on cruelty and sadism. This Sister Bridget must have been abused herself, at one time in her life. We are never told about this, but only those that have been abused end up abusing other people, as has been proven, again and again. Ms. McEwan is an fine actress whose work on the English stage has given us so many outstanding performances in her long and distinguished career. Her take on this sad woman, is so true that she makes us believe she is nothing but a devil in a nun's habit.The three principals, Anne Mare Duff, as Margaret, Nora Jane Noone as Bernadette and Dorothy Duffy as Rose, are excellent as the unfortunate women who are confined to the convent for committing no crime at all. Equally excellent is Eileen Walsh, as Crispina, the pathetic woman who will never be able to be near her own child.This is a very compelling drama that thanks to Peter Mullen's vision comes alive on the screen.",

While we have all seen films depicting cruel religious figures before, I do think this is an important film that had to be made. Its astonishing that these laundries were still in use up until 1996! This film centers on three girls that have been sent to the Magdalene laundries. We first see Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff) who is raped at a wedding by her cousin and the next day her family sends her off. At an orphanage a young girl named Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone) innocently flirts with some boys through a fence and the third girl is Rose (Dorothy Duffy) who is pregnant out of wedlock and they take her baby and put it up for adoption and then send her away. The Magdalene laundries are run by Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan) who is very cruel and strips young girls of their birth name and administers punishment with a cane for any infraction of the rules. These young girls are subjected to harsh working conditions and not allowed to talk while working. The other nuns play sick and cruel games like having them strip naked and figure out who has more hair between their legs. Their is one girl named Crispina (Eileen Walsh) who is mentally handicapped and one of the Priests sexually abuses her whenever given the chance. Some of the girls have been there for a very long time and are not girls anymore. Some are older woman in at least their fifties! They have become institutionalized and brainwashed through the years. This film was directed by actor Peter Mullen and he does a good job of not allowing the material to become exploitative. Even though we have seen these stories on film before it doesn't lessen the shock value. The characters are all written very well and Noone and Duff stand out in my opinion. Noone becomes very jaded and sarcastic about her surroundings and instead of just putting up a tough front she knows that they will have to escape or die behind those walls. There is one very interesting scene where Duff is outside and discovers a door in the back of the fence. She opens it and see's freedom. A car drives up and asks if she wants a ride. She walks back inside instead of trying to escape. I thought this scene suggests the futile nature of running away. These young girls have been abandoned by their families and they have nowhere to go. Duff looks around her and realizes she has no place to run to. While I do think this is a very impressive film I just could not embrace it fully. The subject matter is just to clean and cut. The film doesn't have any answers but this still is a very potent look at a very shameful part of Irish history and the Catholic church. Solid performances and that probably comes from the fact that Mullen understands actors. This is a tough and sometimes brutal film to watch but an important one that needed to be made.",

I don't think I need to go into the plot too much as I'm sure you all know what this movie is about. While I watched I found it disgraceful this activity could go on 40 years ago. I'm only 16 and I found myself contemplating what these Nuns were thinknig when they beat up and humiliated young women for amusement. Is that God's word? I fpund it even more disgusting that these awful asylums brutalised 30,000 women old and young and did not end until 1996! That means it was still going on in my lifetime. I am a Catholic and I believe everything that took place in this movie was accurate and not over the top. The writer/director Peter Mullan did a fine job on this film. He wants to show just how badly these young and some old women who've been there all their lives were treated. I don't think he's trying to turn everyone on the Catholic Church but rather let them know that they are not all about doing good in the world andthere is a lot going on behind closed doors. I never know these events went on until I saw this film and i found it m=even more disgraceful for the Catholic Church not to fully admit to these goings on and they actually have the nerve to try and sew Miramax for releasing it! I am a Catholic and after seeing this film I am quite sad to say that I am not so sure about my stance on my religion anymore. I find it awful that these things went on because these Nuns thought they were doing Gods work. Just how are they doing God's work by making poor women work and wash throughout their entire lives without being allowed to talk. And all this is for nothing. Just so they can get rid of their supposed sins! Give me a break! Just pray to god or go to confession! It may have been different in those times but for this to go on because of getting raped or being unwed mothers is a disgrace. Thats my view anyway. I also believe those Nuns who did those dispicable things will be going to hell for this because they certainly deserve to. Whether you agree or disagree is down to you and everyone is entitled to their own opinion.Overall this film is powerful, harrowing, truthful but certainly not entertaining. You can't go into this film with a smile on your face. You have to watch it closely as its a movie thats thought provoking. I think you'll find you'll be quite disgusted at the Catholic Church after seeing this movie and rightly so. I certainly was. I can only hope that this activity never goes on again and the Catholic Church can admit to this and repay those poor women who are still alive that were sent to work at these asylums.10/10 An excellent film nd definitely worth a watch",

He's simply told it how it was, and that was enough.What struck me throughout the film was that the abusers - in particular the nuns - had obviously been severely abused themselves, and so to justify this treatment, they simply passed it on, claiming it to be the right thing to do under God, to tame the spirit of attractive or sexually experienced girls. (It's pertinent to note that today's terrorists also consider they have God on their side, and they are acting according to God's plan for the world.)I thoroughly applaud Peter Mullan's film-making style, often using images rather than dialogue as a way of advancing the narrative.  Who can forget the cry of the poor girl who'd been sexually abused by the priest?  Over and over, like a wounded animal, she cried `You are not a man of God, you are not a man of God.....'

Those cops, as the nuns in the film, ruled by terror and brutality. People were assaulted and humiliated and denigrated for the least of reasons.This film could have easily veered off track into a running anti-Catholic joke or screed, but its artistic 'reality' is too levelheaded to allow that. Basically, last century in Ireland was a misogynist's utopia. Young women were horded off to laundries to do slave labor for the Roman Catholic church, under the guidance of nuns from the Magdalene sisterhood, whose hope was to redeem prostitutes, unwed mothers, and other 'fallen girls'. The title is a play off this fact and three young women who are the stars of the film. Based upon real women, although for dramatic purposes their tales are condensed into the 1960s (the DVD's documentary Sex In A Cold Climate shows the women the lead characters were based on, and their age range varies over a quarter of a century). Why the 1960s and not the 1940s seems only to be for the belief among many artists that this was the last period of social justice in the world. The three girls represent different archetypes of 'fallen women': the orphan and would be prostitute and sexual temptress Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff), whose crime is flirting with boys at Catholic school; the unwed mother Rose- called Patricia by the nuns (Dorothy Duffy), whose child is taken away from her by her parents, and rape/incest victim Bernadette (Nora-Jane No one), whose brutalizing by her cousin, is followed by her parents shipping away, until her younger brother- who cried out for her as she was taken away, comes to rescue her four years later\u0085. The Catholic Church in Ireland condemned this 2003 film, which is no surprise, but given its problems with pedophile priests, does anyone watching this really believe the claims of sadistic lesbian nuns is NOT credible! That these Magdalene laundry camps were run until 1996 is amazing (in the worst sense), but all too emblemic of the evils of all religion- from the Crusades and Inquisitions, Martin Luther to Torquemada, the Conquistadores and the Taliban. Writer/director Peter Mullan never veers into caricature, which says a lot, given the subject matter, and the acting is utterly superb. McEwan, as Sister Bridget, reeks wickedry like few characters in film history. Even Nurse Ratched, from One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, seems kind-hearted by comparison. And this film is worlds better than a similarly-themed film from a few years ago, Girl, Interrupted, which seemed more like a chicks behind bars film. None of the actresses in The Magdalene Sisters are likely to become sex symbols, like the collagen lipped and breast enhanced Angelina Jolie. They are attractive, but real looking.",

The acting is incredibly moving and Geraldine McEwen as the Head Sister gives a fantastic performance.SPOILERS*****SPOILERS**** I must comment onsome of the other \"reviews\" in here though that complain the movie was too predictable or the nuns were too one-dimensional. Look, this really happned. I am an ex-Catholic and I knew about these horrible \"laundries\" as far back as 1978. Girls were put in these places not just for having babies out of wedlock but also for the awful crime of making out with boys!!! Oh Lord! It is an absolute crime what happened to these girls and for someone to whine that they could \"predict\" what would happen to each girl is an insult to the real pain and anguish these people really suffered. So sorry naive and stupid moviegoer, that the girl's rape was so predictable. Im sure she wished she could spice it up with a Shane Black re-write to satisfy you. And I really disagree with the claims about the so-called \"one-note\" nuns. In fact, I really admired Peter Mullan for taking the time with that one scene where Crispina isdragged away to a mental asylum and after all the screaming and crying and violence, Mullan just puts the camera on McEwen's amazing face as she sits there in the hallway, stunned and drained. The look on her face was self-hatred and doubt - as if asking herself \"what I am doing??\" Stunning. That's like someone watching Schindler's List and complaining that it was predictable because you knew so many were going to die in the camps. This is a largely unknown horror of the Church that deserves to be brought to the public's attention. Mullan does a great job with a fine cast. Yes, it is very hard to sit through and if you are raised on a diet of Batman and Charlie's Angels movies, then this is not for you.",

            "content": "Scotland-born triple-threat (director, writer and actor) Peter Mullan's Venice GOLDEN LION champion, his second directorial endeavor, THE MAGDALENE SISTERS is a scathing expos\u00e9 charts the story of three \"fallen\" girls' harrowing experiences in the notorious Magdalene Asylum in the 60s Ireland, where Roman Catholic church reigns with draconian measures to suppress women under the name of redeeming their sins.Before its title card duly arrives, the film briefly introduces the sins of our three protagonists, Margaret (Duff), is raped by her cousin during a family wedding, Bernadette (No one), an adolescent orphan deemed as a temptress simply because she flirts with a bunch of hormone- driven lads, and Rose (Duffy), a girl has just borne an out-of-wedlock infant. So burdened with these egregious injustice, they are sent to the asylum by their parents or caretakers, which is in fact a laundry run by nuns and governed by Sister Bridget (McEwan) with high-handed cruelty, in her first appearance Mullan conspicuously implies that God is definitely not her priority.Different personalities of these three girls are soberly singled out in their following dark days: Bernadette, the young rebellious one, learns a hard lesson after a failed escape plan, botched in the eleventh hour by her craven accomplice, a man of course, and becomes more cynical to her fellow inmates hereafter, No one, a headstrong starlet strikes with a piquant weight of strength and endurance; Margaret, is more flexible and sagacious among the gals, bears patiently her sufferings in exchange for a triumphant exit, and Duff nails her heroic facade wonderfully, she is the one, who voluntarily gives up a golden chance of escaping, and pulls through her trails and tribulations with a heartfelt declamation when she can face the God's men and challenge their muted consent of such atrocity; Duffy, uncannily resembles a young Joanne Woodward, her Rose is the meek sheep among the crop, offers a more subdued presence of forbearance and motherly nature.There is another victim here in the spotlight, whose fate is manifestly far less fortunate, to countervail the aforementioned three's ultimate salvation from the pit, Eileen Walsh plays Crispina, a mentally unstable unmarried mother, whose bob hairstyle doesn't match her bucktoothed features, but what happens to her encapsulates the appalling and despicable crimes those clergymen and nuns can ever inflicted on innocent souls under the aegis of the supremacy of God, no religion can ever account for those kinds of transgressions. Walsh courageously transforms a stunning performance out of Eileen's misery, her repeated, plangent bellow of truth is soul- shattering to say the least. Last but definitely not the least, the veteran British thespian, Geraldine McEwan, whose cinematic offerings are not so frequent, but here, she devotes herself wholeheartedly to bring about a daunting impersonation of an evil nun, driven by the monetary income, she is merciless to harness those helpless women while maintaining a holy-than-thou face of authority and patronization, only in the heightened crunch, her instinct tellingly betrays that there is something more important to her than her piousness to God.Overall, this clammy, unadorned survival drama is a gripping nay-sayer of God-awful religious abuse in our recent history, Mullan, most of the time, holds his sway over the thorny subject matter and never descends to levity, only in the scenes of Bernadette and Rose's final attempt to break out of their imprisonment, Mullan slickly transmits a whiff of comedy and triumphalism into their act, which works well to purvey an uplifting coda, yet, in another instance, two nuns obnoxiously tease about the sizes of their prisoners' breasts and their public hair, is just too nauseating to concur with Mullan's relentless opprobrium, nevertheless, this well-orchestrated film again emphatically attests the same old maxim: real life is so much worse than what happens in a movie.",

A better technique is to relieve the tension and the emotional stress of a dark film like this with occasional flashes of humour. But this is one exceedingly long voyage into bleak hopelessness. I've seen stuff about the Warsaw ghetto that has more lighter moments. There is only one in this endless sequence of gloom. Nor does the use of black and white achieve its purpose. It obviously was intended to underline the sombre character of the whole picture but it comes off looking like a budget move instead. The director has not exploited effective black and white techniques nor used any of the creative angles and shadows and framing that make black and white work in these circumstances.

The subject matter is handled deftly, and is not unduly disturbing, all considering. But it is still gut-wrenching, without producing the feeling that you are being manipulated. If anything, it leaves you wondering if the reality was actually worse. Most important, you feel the girls would have wanted the world to know this story.There is one word to describe what these girls experienced: Slavery. More to the point, state-endorsed slavery. In the 20th century. But to some people, these were the good old days, the days of state-sponsored \"morality,\" as compared to the licentiousness of people who actually enjoy sexual freedom.As I watched it, George Orwell's 1984 resonated throughout. It is a world in which reason is so warped that the raped becomes the guilty, and the rapist goes free, in which sexual love is evil and sadism is the path to salvation, in which, through servitude and punishments, a person is bent from hating to loving their oppressor, in this case Big Sister. The world of 1984 became unfashionable, at least until it came and went, without it seemingly materializing. But the specter of state-sponsored mind control is not so impossible.There are people today who would return the United States, and other countries, to a condition of state religion. These are the people who parade under the banner of \"right to life\" because they don't have the honesty to wear the label that really describes their goals. What is portrayed in this movie is what life was like in one part of the world before abortion was legal. It was a world in which the woman was guilty, even if she was raped. Think about it: many of the right to lifers of today would make it illegal to have an abortion, even if the woman was raped. Next time you see one of those bumper stickers that says \"Chose life - your mother did!\" consider this movie, for this is the reality behind this twisted logic. These people would impose their religious beliefs upon everyone else in the country by way of laws of the state, if they could only get control of the U.S. Senate, House of Representatives, the Presidency and the Supreme Court. And they have gotten mighty close. To get right to the point, what we are talking about is a Christian Taliban. And that is what we could wind up with in the United States. This movie is not about ancient history; it is about people who are still alive today. It is not fiction.The issue is not so much whether Catholicism - or other forms of Christianity, or Islam, or any other religion - is bad. The issue is whether a religion can be allowed to so dominate a nation, as it did in Ireland, that it can do virtually whatever it wants with individuals, with the support of the police. People should be free to practice their religion, but they should also be free from the kind of practices this film depicts.",

It must be pointed out that the Catholic Church did many good works and deeds, educated the poor, ran soup kitchens and so on and were not all evil paedophiles as is sometimes portrayed. However, a great deal of power unofficially lay with the Church and power corrupts. Absolute power was something that the Church in Ireland were not far away from having and the worst stories and atrocities, some of which would be depicted in this movie, stem as a result of this.The movie tells the tale of a number of girls sent to work away their sins in the laundries and workhouses of the Magdelene Sisters. It will amaze viewers to see the conditions and punishments endured in these institutions. At times, prison seems like a better option.The acting is of a high quality and the story's not bad. If you found this movie interesting, or you wish to see some other movies, which are in my opinion better than this one, about these social issues and changes in Ireland then I can recommend two. First off, there's \"Song For A Raggy Boy\" with Aiden Quinn which is basically the \"Dead Poet's Society\" to this \"Mona Lisa Smile\", i.e. a male version. Being a man myself, perhaps I am biased but of the two I would prefer \"Song For A Raggy Boy\". Another movie of note, which is a bit more of a love story intertwined with all the religious guilt and judgement as well as social standing, is \"This Is My Father\" with James Caan and Aiden Quinn (yes, again) which is outstanding in my opinion and well worth checking out! The Magdelene Sisters comes a commendable and respectable third to those other two though!",

The film begins with a rape of one of the young sisters.

This abuse is rampant and we subsequently find that it affects some 30,000 girls who stayed there over the years.

Here and there things pick up - as in the scene in which Margaret finds the garden gate open - but otherwise, Mullan really needed to find some psychological gold to lace through the realist dross.These days I'm down on films that don't seek to give their audience reward for sitting in the dark, and The Magdalene Sisters may be a finer work than I suggest.

            "content": "Once and while motion pictures shed light on situations in other parts of the world that most people didn't know existed. In `Cry Freedom,' it was Apartheid in South Africa, and in last year's `Rabbit-Proof Fence,' it was the story of three Australian girls escaping a facility to integrate them into white society. Now, we have `The Magdalene Sisters,' the compelling true story of three Irish girls sent to a reform school for \u0091crimes' that they supposedly had committed in the 1960s. While in care of the Catholic Church, these girls as endured torture, both emotionally and physically but found the courage and strength to survive the brutality and escape the abuse that led to the demise of many. \t`The Magdalene Sisters' follows the account of three girls, Margaret, Bernadette and Rose as they are sent to an asylum for women to absolve them of their \u0091sins' by the ways of hard work, and brutal punishment.  Hardly sins at all-Margaret was raped by her cousin and sent away to avoid shame in her family, Bernadette was flirtatious with boys so she was seen as a whore, and Rose had a child out of wedlock. While in the institution, the girls are abused emotionally, physically and sexually by both nuns and priests. Their stay in the asylum is uncertain and it forces some of the girls to attempt to escape and even suicide. Some prove effective, but if they aren't, the girls will face the extreme punishments of the maniacal sisters. In the end, some of the girls manage to escape the horrid conditions and run away to set up lives by disguising their true identities. But their lives are will be forever scorned by the agony that they endured at the Magdalene Laundries.  The most tragic situation that the film portrays is that of a young woman named Crispina (Eileen Walsh). While in the courtyard of the academy, Crispina's sister brings by Crispina's young son. These visits give the girl hope that she will one day see her son again. They also give her the strength to endure the suffering. But Crispina seems to fall into the depths of madness, perhaps from the stress of the institution and being apart from normal society. She is eventually sent to an insane asylum for an incident in which she humiliates herself publicly by exposing a sexual encounter with a priest. Perhaps the most engaging part of `The Magdalene Sisters' is the general knowledge that these situations were allowed to exist until the last asylum was closed in 1996. It's mind boggling that in a world as informed as we are today, these conditions were kept quiet. However, it's understandable why perhaps many women chose not to discuss it-they were humiliated and abused in awful ways. If anything, the ones that were able to escape probably chose to keep quiet in order to keep themselves from entering the institutions again, or perhaps to avoid the pain of remembering. Another point that the film acknowledges is the treatment of women, not only in the asylums but also in society. In scenes where the women are taken into the streets, people completely ignore them. They are seen and referred to by several as whores who don't deserve to be a part of the community.Director Peter Mullen has crafted a superb film that exposes the immorality of the Irish Catholic Church and the institutions it set up to cure these girls of their \u0091sins;' moreover, on the families who knew of the suffering and did nothing to prevent it. ***1/2",

They must have set too high ideals that they, in the end, can't reach, and instead became the opposite, still thinking they're moral while they aren't at all.",

When the story of the girls and their situation was told, one word came to mind: (Catholic) Taliban. And I do not mean the bearded backwoodsmen from Pakistan and Afghanistan armed with AK-47s, but devote (male) Catholics from Ireland waving with bibles, amulets and the like. I feel sorry for the girls and women who were subjected to this Catholic tyranny, where as a female one could only be a saint, or a whore. Men on the contrary where allowed to misbehave, and getting away with it. Well, after going to confession to some equally hypocrite priest. However, the strength of the first part, the accusation of the Catholic church, is reversed in the second half of the movie where the story becomes more focused on the individuals. Individuals are needed to tell a story of course, but the story got a bit lost by focusing to much, in my opinion, on the individuals. Had the end changed more in line with the first part, i.e. the accusation, than I would have rated this movie 8/10, whereas now it is 7/10.However, let this not withhold you from seeing this great movie on a somewhat neglected subject in (Catholic) history.",

            "content": "THE MAGDALENE SISTERS, directed by Peter Mullan, is an important film not only because of the history it documents, but its quiet insistence that the past is always prologue. This is particularly true of the Magdalene reformatories designed for \"errant women\", the last of which were closed by the Catholic Church just a few years ago. Apparently the number of women who were incarcerated in these nationwide facilities of Ireland numbers in the tens of thousands. To call this a tragedy is serious understatement.The characters the film hones in on are Rose, the mother of a child born out of wedlock, Bernadette, a young orphan who has been sent to the \"correctional facility\" for the crime of flirting, and Margaret, who was raped by a cousin at a family gathering. All of these young women have been referred to these facilities for indefinite terms of \"rehabilitation\" by family, guardians or priests. In the facility itself, they are made acquaintance with Crispina, a mildly retarded young woman who has also given birth to an \"illegitimate\" child, and Katy, who is a trustee of sorts who was sent to the facility by her family some decades before. Overseeing this horror show is the miserly prude Sister Bridget and her \"Sisters\" in the faith. The entire carnival of sadism is blessed by the local archdiocese, one of whose priests is quietly raping Crispina, the inmate least able to defend herself. THE MAGDALENE SISTERS is a powerful film about a terrible and contradictory chapter in the history and culture of Ireland, and it resonates with the viewer long after its over. It's certainly not a movie one looks forward to sitting through more than once. But it's an important film, one that jars the viewer, and makes the words of Charles Dickens resonate even more profoundly: \"These are only a shadow of things that have been, but they are what they are.\"",

Does she receive the support she needs from her family? Oh no - they ship her out of their lives in the early hours of the morning, presumably to avoid the twitching curtains of the neighbours.Then there is Rose who has a child out of wedlock. She is forced to give the baby up for adoption and then taken away herself. Her mother even refuses to look at the baby.Finally we meet Bernadette at the orphanage. She shows a faint interest in the local boys through the fence in the playground. And yes, you've guessed it. Off she goes.Once there we get an insight to the strict regime that the nuns instill within the \"laundry\" - eating bread and bacon for breakfast whilst the women eat gruel. There is also the no talking to each other policy - ever! Surely only death could be worse, and their \"crimes\" would not even be blinked at today, and I'm sure (or hope) that they would receive parental support in our times of now.A moving and sometimes shocking film - I was left wondering how close to the truth the story was (but some of the scenes could not have been dreamt up from nothing). The main shock for me was discovering at the end that these laundries existed until 1996.Superb viewing - a must.",

            "content": "Be forewarned, there are possible spoilers ahead.I saw this movie for the first time tonight. I watched it twice. Unfortunately I missed the very beginning both times, but I still feel I got a good understanding of what this movie was about. I was absolutely shocked watching what happened to these young women.I am not Christian but I was compelled to watch this film. It was a stunning revelation to see how these young women were treated at these convents. I hesitate to use the term asylum because in my society asylum is where people are sent if they are mentally unbalanced.These women (most of them) were not mentally imbalanced. They were just normal, everyday women being punished for nothing other than existing and learning about life. They were repeatedly punished through physical torture, public humiliation, and mental torment. Their sole purpose for being in these convents was to work in the laundries and bring in money for the convents. The nuns ran the convents through sadistic punishments whenever the girls stepped out of line whether it was for a real transgression or for an imagined one.It stuns me that people living outside the convents lived in ignorance of the goings on of these girls. Much like Germany lived in ignorance of what Hitler was doing to the Jews. I suppose it is easier to turn a blind eye and pretend such things don't happen than to admit that these things not only occur regularly, but are also wrong and should be stopped.One of the girls living in this convent was I suspect a little dim-witted to begin with, and she was repeatedly humiliated every chance the nuns got. I am not positive, but from a particular scene it indicated that the girl I think was a bit dim-witted had been intimate with the head priest of the convent. During this scene the girl has a massive negative outburst toward the priest and in the very next scene the girl is woken up from sleep by the head nun and informed that she is being sent to a \"hospital\" where the staff there can better \"care\" for her then the nuns. The girl rightfully freaks out and fights the nun and the two men who have come to take her away. She is not going to a hospital, but a mental asylum. Later her mother comes for her but is told by another girl there (who later gets severely beaten for her \"sin\" of speaking to the mother) that the daughter was taken away a year ago. So, not only are these young women tortured, both mentally and physically, but their families (the ones that actually do care about them) are kept completely in the dark of what is happening to their daughters.Eventually the torture and abuse becomes too much for two of the girls to handle and they devise a plan to escape. They are very nearly prevented from doing so, but their desperation and determination sees them through and they manage to gain their freedom. Unfortunately, getting out of the convent does not solve all their problems. Through the final \"bios\" of the main girls in the film, we learn that they are still haunted by their time spent in the convent. Some choose never to marry while others get married and divorced repeatedly.If you are looking for a feel good movie, this is not it. If you are looking for a possible realistic portrayal of what many young women went through while these Magdalene Convents were in existence and how their lives were affected by their experiences, then you should definitely watch this film. This film will open your eyes to the treatment of women and it will shock and appall you and you will find yourself silently applauding the girls every time they resist because you know that they are not rebelling because they are just \"rowdy teens\", but because they are fighting a horridly unjust system that judges them harshly and tries to correct their \"sins\" through sadistic and humiliating punishment methods.Some of the comments I've read here talk about how women are treated in various parts of the world and one commenter wrote about the difference between the women of this convent and women in America at the same time in the '60s. Women in almost every society have been seen as inferior to men and have been regarded merely as property or even as eternal children who must be cared for first by their parental family and later by their husbands because they aren't seen to be able to provide for themselves. In America, it wasn't until the early 1970's before the Constitution amended that women were people and not property. The early NINETEEN SEVENTIES!!!!!!!!!!! So it really shouldn't come as a surprise that there are still countries today in the supposed Millennium where women are treated as though they are nothing and are punished at the drop of a hat for merely showing a strand of hair or an inch more skin than their society allows. Until women EVERYWHERE are recognized as PEOPLE and not OBJECTS, women will never be free of tyranny and injustice and will always suffer somewhere merely for existing.",

            "review_title": "Ireland, the worst democracy on earth",
            "content": "This movie is a masterpiece, moving, touching and a well and objectively interpreted piece of history. 30.000 women have been segregated in a prison called \"Magdalene Laundries\", where nouns were brutal, sadistic, without feelings and not respecting even one of the international human rights of people. The shocking thing is that this all ended only in 1996, about 50 years after all other western countries became civilized and started respecting human and womens rights. This movie makes me think of Ireland as a brutal country, where no democracy and human rights exist. I will never go to Ireland in my life, I can't stand people did not make a revolution against this new form of Hitler Lager, that ended only 9 years ago. The movie shows that, as usual, behind all is money, as usual, and none of the silly histories invented by the Catholic Church, in which the nouns never believed. Apart from the physical violence, the movie shows an even greater psychological violence, extended to extremes rarely to be found in human history. I'm wondering how Ireland could enter the European Union and would be happy if they just were thrown out. This is not Europe, this resembles much more the fundamentalist Muslim countries, as far as womens rights are concerned. The last scene, about Crispina, is one of the most touching things I've ever seen in my life and I do not recommend it to sensible people (just close your eyes and don't watch). This scene generates a great anger: the Church, against its fake principles, is sexually very corrupt and does not care about the tremendous traumas a women can have. I personally think the Church is the most false, hypocrite, violent, without scruples, inhuman, cheating and corrupt institution on Earth, even worse than governments. I believe all people involved in the \"Magdalene\" Scandals should be sued by the state and have to pay for their cruelty with long years in prison (possibly for the rest of their lives) and possibly working full-time in a prison laundry. It's an Italian writing, most people will believe the Church dominates here. Nothing less correct. Italy signed a pact with the Vatican in the '20s. Since then the Church is only subject to the laws of the state and is considered a cultural association. The Church can not be involved in any kind of public institution and can not be involved in politics. We know the crimes the Church has committed in the past and for this reason only 30% of the population goes to Church at least once in a year. To the contrary there is a great movement of opposition to the Church, every day more hated. Only 2% of people aged 18-30 believe in the silly histories the Church continues to preach.A last advice to the Irish: leave your country, haven't you realized you still live in the middle-ages?All the economic development you recently had, by creating a fiscal paradise, is just the surface of middle-age value. Now please go to Church, it's late, and possibly beat a prostitute or a women if you find one on your way. And be proud to have had the last Nazi Lager in the history of western countries.",

However if a Catholic is liberal minded and understands that there is good, bad and downright viciously ugly components in every faith, then see this film.\nAnd to think that the last of these Irish Magdalene asylums,slave labor prisons lasted until 1996,is unthinkable.

            "content": "The other night, I watched The Magdalene Sisters; I've seen it several times, in fact. Part of the DVD is the documentary \"Sex in a Cold Climate.\" The documentary is worth seeing by itself, regardless of whether or not one views The Magdalene Sisters.Seeing the movie helped me to be very thoughtful of a number of things as a Catholic, as a former student of Sociology, and as a person who tries to be aware of what is going on in the world. Sometimes it's difficult to consider something from a perspective other than one's immediate, and sometimes very comfortable, frame of reference. Watching this movie a number of times helped me get out of that familiar comfort zone. I came to see, and I'm grateful for it, that there is quite a bit of \"both-and\" stuff going on in and through this story of the young women in the Magdalene asylums.As a lifelong Catholic, I feel very passionately about a number of aspects of this spiritual tradition. As a student of Sociology, I try to remember that one aspect of this religious tradition is that it is partially a societal construct, that there are definitely processes of socialization at work, and that it is at times very difficult to develop a relationship with Catholicism. As someone who tries to be aware of the world around me, I find myself wondering, \"What am I to do about this? Can I do anything about this? Can I help folks in any way?\" The other night, I sat down to watch The Magdalene Sisters with its documentary again, and pondered quite a number of things. It's not easy to watch this movie, or the documentary; it's painful to watch at times. My God! What did these women endure? Some were pushed to suicide, others were sexually abused, countless others emotionally degraded, physically tormented, and left for dead, spiritually, psychologically, and emotionally, if not physically.Two of the women interviewed in the documentary have distanced themselves considerably from the Catholic Church; can one blame them? And others remain very much attached to the Catholic Church; can one blame them? And can one assume that, because one is attached to the Catholic Church, that she or he denies the degenerative things the Catholic Church has done at times? I don't blame people for leaving; I certainly do not either blame people for staying. But when one is unwilling to face, with honesty, the dehumanizing things human beings are capable, and culpable, of, one runs the dangerous risk of perpetuating these things.If, indeed, the Catholic Church is guilty of the abuse that is reported to have happened, then let's call the abuse by its proper name, and hold the Church accountable, and demand that it make reparation, and practice what it preaches, and work for healing for those who have suffered.It seems to me people should be doing something else, too, and that is to ask why the parents and families of the over 30,000 women detained in the Magdalene asylums could send them there in the first place. What kind of a parent blames a daughter's rape on her, and, when the daughter desperately needs the comfort and support and protection of her family, instead is abandoned by that very family to one of those dehumanizing asylums? What kind of parents have more children they can afford to feed on one hand, and takes away the baby of its unwed daughter, sending the daughter away to a Magdalene asylum on the other? What kind of consistent ethic of life is that? A scripture scholar I am not, which is, doubtless, good news for those reading this, as well as for the church; but I remember some of the words of Jesus, \"If the world hates you, remember it hated me before you.\" Perhaps a similar thing could be said in to the women who were detained in these asylums; \"If the church betrayed you in these asylums, remember - those who handed you over to these asylums, your very families - betrayed you first.\" Yes, indeed - the Catholic Church has been guilty of unspeakable things at times. Anyone who has at least two marbles upstairs, a pulse, and the ability to read history will concede that.But there are families and parents, too, who are equally, if not more morally culpable, of unspeakable things, too, no less than the church.It takes a sick person to rape someone. It takes a sicker person to hold the victim down while the rapist does the raping.",

This is a true story that desperately needed to be exposed and I am pleased to say this film tells the story beautifully.\nWith a cast of young unknown actresses who mostly look like your next door neighbor, and set in the 1960's (when I was the same age as these girls), I was devastatingly aware that this horror could easily have happened to me.

The fact that the austere Magdalene asylums existed is undeniable. Undoubtedly, a number of young women sent there by their parents or guardians were treated cruelly. However, Mullan puts forth an oversimplified, worst-case scenario in which every nun is a monster and the only priest connected with the laundry has forced a simple young woman confined there to yield to his sexual demands. An audience has a right to wonder whether the film is attempting to throw light on a painful, little-known situation or merely genuflecting at the altar of sensationalism while exploiting others' suffering.The film centers on four young women who were sent off to perform manual labor in facilities known as the \"Magdalene laundries\" in order to be spiritually rehabilitated for their alleged sins of the flesh.Mullan's narrative presents them as physically and verbally abused by the nuns in charge of the laundry as if the four actually existed. However, these characters are fictitious, made up from composites of stories Mullan heard from those who lived in the workhouses -- a fact muddied by the coda that appears at the end of the film explaining \"what became of\" each of the characters.As such, the movie's treatment of events exploits the facts to make it less a story of the four than a film aimed at positioning the church as one-dimensionally wicked. The nuns pictured are so uniformly sadistic and hypocritical that they make the infamous Nurse Ratched in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" seem like Mother Teresa.Unlike what follows, the film's opening scene is well-crafted. Using scant dialogue, it cinematically depicts young Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff) being lured upstairs during a wedding reception by her cousin, who then rapes her and proceeds to pin the blame on her. The next day her scornful parents turn her over to a priest who delivers her to a Magdalene laundry workhouse at the same time that orphaned flirt Bernadette (Nora-Jane No one) and unwed mother Rose (Dorothy Duffy) arrive.Insisting that they atone for their sins through hard manual labor, silence and no contact with the outside world, vicious Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan) brooks no questions and terrorizes the trio. Already veering toward madness is another unwed mother, the mentally challenged Crispina (Eileen Walsh), who believes she can communicate with her sister and toddler through her cherished St. Christopher medal. Overseeing the women's physical and spiritual well-being is a coven of Gestapo-like nuns.This is the set-up. But beyond it, caricature trumps character. In place of narrative, the film unreels one horror after another on the four young women in lurid, episodic fashion: brutal beatings and malicious mind games by the nuns, including a group shower-room scene involving extended full frontal nudity and taunting insults aimed at dehumanizing their humiliated charges. The nuns, presented as consistently evil, money-grubbing, merciless hags, have no emotional depth. They are as exaggerated in their sadism as Ingrid Bergman is in celestial benevolence in \"The Bells of St. Mary's\" -- the film Sister Bridget sheds a crocodile tear over at a Christmas screening. Not one ounce of human kindness -- not to mention Christian compassion -- can be found under any wimple or collar.This painting with broad brush strokes is better suited for the propagandist than the dramatist. Regrettably, drama is jettisoned along with objectivity since this kind of stacking the deck drains the narrative of any inner tension. The result is a cavalcade of cartoonish vignettes which present to viewers about as nuanced a picture of Irish nuns as 1915's \"The Birth of a Nation\" did of African-Americans. This pervasive shallowness extends to the girls themselves. Despite overall strong performances, they serve as little more than props, punching bags for the sinister nuns to vent their fury.While some blame is attached to parents who so readily banished daughters in difficulty to the harsh conditions of these laundries, any attempt to understand the forces that shaped these institutions, which had much to do with the distinct religious and cultural milieu of the time and place in which they flourished, is rejected. The righteous indignation felt for the girls, while justified by the suffering they endured, is wrung out of the audience through cheap, kick-the-puppy melodrama where the audience is manipulated to cheer when the nuns get a taste of their own medicine.It's distressing that any Irish women had to endure the deplorable conditions of these workhouses. But the film never attempts to move beyond shrill finger-pointing toward any meaningful insights. In place of a sensitive examination of abuse of religious power, Mullan's simplistic approach in depicting all the religious in his script as gleeful villains only serves to undermine the credibility of his film.",

The movie tells a story about young women from different family backgrounds who were placed into a Catholic-run laundry in Ireland to be redeemed of their \"sins\". It exposed the inhumane treatment of those women who were striped of their human dignity and condemned to a life of slavery.The casting was great with mostly unknown young actresses who will astonish you with their amazing depiction of young women experiencing the death of their souls and loss of their innocence, while struggling to reconcile their faith with their human dignity. The acting was superb and very real with no over-dramatization or miraculous rescue operations (typical of Hollywood films). Just simple ordinary young women being violated and abandoned to the point of developing distrust and bitterness toward their most trusted institution, the church. The directing and editing were excellent and done to near perfection with no uncomfortable scenes, prolonged dialogs, or superficial lectures.These actresses delivered very convincing performances. Hollywood should pay attention to talents like these and realize that there is more to acting than Julia Roberts and Tom Cruise and other overpaid, overrated actors. They need to look for fresh new talents like these young actresses to deliver quality movies with the added benefit of lower cost. There was never a dull moment in this movie. I felt engaged in every aspect of it and connected with its characters at many levels, feeling their suffering and witnessing the loss of their spirits. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen.",

            "review_title": "Who washes your dirty laundry?",
            "content": "Warning: Possible Spoilers    The Catholic Church has taken a beating in recent years because of its proclivity to hide its abuses, and when found out to deny or even justify what has been hidden. Peter Mullan's disturbing film The Magdalene Sisters, met with just such a response when it opened at The Venice Film Festival in September of 2002. Publicly and resoundingly condemned by the Vatican, the newspaper headlines were a clear denial-\"Liar, Liar, Liar!\" By the time the film opened in Ireland a few months later, the Church was silent, and yet a few months after that the head of the Catholic Church in Scotland encouraged every Catholic to see it. In an interview, Mullan vacillates between their motives; are they finally admitting their culpability or is this just a PR move to stem the controversy? Controversial it is, and although admittedly a work of fiction, the film is based on the very real experiences of several young women who were forced to live and work in the Church run Magdalene Laundry Asylums in 1960's Ireland. Inspired by the documentary, Sex in a Cold Climate, Mullan discovered that these institutions were not part of some medieval church history as one might expect, but survived well into the present. By the time the last laundry closed in 1996, over 30,000 women had been virtually imprisoned by the Catholic Church in the name of salvation. Forced to work off their sins by symbolically washing dirty laundry, the unwilling penitents labored 15 hours a day, 364 days a year under brutal conditions, which included beatings, humiliation, isolation, and near starvation. Surprisingly, most of these women-young girls at the time-were sent to the laundries by someone who believed they were helping to save their eternal souls. The four main characters in the film illustrate the offenses for which they are confined.    For Rose (Dorothy Duffy) and Crispina (Eileen Walsh), the reason is clear; they have both had a child out of wedlock. Crispina has the added complication of being mentally-challenged, and is thus a potential sexual attraction to young men who might take advantage of her and be lead astray. Paradoxically, the concern seems more for the young men and not for Crispina. Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff) has been raped by her cousin and hidden away by her family because in this particular culture at this particular time, the whisper of scandal is to be avoided at all costs, and in a theocratic and patriarchal society, the culpability is hers. Bernadette's (Nora-Jane Noone) only crime is being too pretty. A bit flirty, she is a temptation for young Catholic boys and although she proclaims her innocence to the head nun she is met with a response she cannot refute: Bernadette: I'm just wondering why I'm here. I've not committed any crimes. I've never been with any lads ever. It's God's honest truth. Sr. Bridget: But you'd like to, wouldn't you? Sex outside of wedlock-or even the perception of such-was considered a mortal sin in the century and a half that the Magdalene Asylums prospered in Ireland, and because of this no penance was deemed too great. The Catholic Church has yet to apologize to the women whose lives were lost and whose spirits were broken under the pretext of salvation. Most of them are dead now, but their families and the children many of them were forced to give up for adoption are not. This film is Mullan's way to create a public forum for such a confrontation.Confrontational to be sure, the Magdalene Sisters is also simplistic. The nuns who were so cruel and the priests who took sexual advantage of the penitents played only one part in this horrifying portrait. The larger Church condoned it by allowing it to happen, and the civil authorities turned more than a blind eye; they returned the few girls who managed to escape to their captives without investigation. But the responsibility ultimately lies with the people of God-good Christians like you and me-who live our lives in silence and in uninformed ignorance and allow such atrocities to happen. The families of these girls knew and accepted a God of fear as taught by the Catholic Church and lived their lives accordingly. They hid away in silence and in darkness what they dared not confront, whether that was their wayward daughters or their own sexuality. Many walked by these asylums daily without ever questioning what went on inside. Many more sent their dirty laundry-literally and metaphorically-to the nuns, never knowing that it was the tears of innocents and not holy water that washed their clothes. How many of us live our lives in the same kind of self-imposed ignorance? What walls do we walk by without asking what goes on behind them? What injustices do we perpetuate by our silence? Great films raise profound questions that have the potential to elicit change in the lives of the people who watch them. The Magdalene Sisters is a great film.",

The best thing about the film, which occasionally stumbles over minor script problems, but which has uniformly terrific performances, is the character of Bernadette. Mullen has included a character who never internalizes the guilt and shame of her so-called 'temptress' status. She expresses in vivid language and bold behavior a healthy and appropriate response to her situation, thus pointing the way to any youthful moviegoer who might still be struggling against the shackles of Catholic guilt. Through this character, the film transcends the muckraking genre, and becomes something much more: a fearless call to action and rebellion.",

The openin sequence - with the tragic presentation of the three leads - is the best way to start the movie. The atmosphere is intense and became stifling when the girls enter the Devil home: \"The Magdalene\" convent. The rest of the film is a horrible fall into a real hell on earth. The Magdalene Sisters are human incarnations of Devil and you will see that for the entire movie, from the first scene in the convent until the last.Peter Mullan, who was in Venice to present the film, did a wonderful job and confirms himself as a great talent: he chose an impressive all-female cast (he also play a bit part as the father of one of the girls) who really support the film: the actress who play the monstrous sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan) plays with such intensity the most-horrible character of the story. The three girls (plus the exceptional Eileen Walsh, who gave an heartbreaking performance as Crispina), are young, beautiful and really talented: Nora Jane Noone (Bernadette) make you hate/love her rebellius character; Anne-Marie Duff plays Margareth with all her heart and emotions; Dorothy Duffy uses her beauty and talent to gave life to her role, Rose (re-named Patricia by the sisters). I am a boy and I hated with all myself all the male characters in the film (with the sisters, of course). Most intense sequences: a terrible close-up of Nora Jane Noone bleeding eye with Sister Bridget\"s face reflected on; the last scene of Crispina: my heart break-up in that moment.

They do not take any pleasure from the way they treat the girls, they simply believe that what they are doing is correct. Bar one scene involving the girls standing naked in front of a laughing nun this is true for the whole movie, and even in that scene it is more out of stupidity rather than any sadistic pleasure that the girls are humiliated. Mullan did the right thing by not trying to score political points off of the Catholic church. He simply tells a truthful story and leaves the decisions up to you.I went to this movie expecting to be horrified but in the end the tales told were nothing more harrowing than that which I have already heard told many a time. I'm sure it will have a much stronger impact on those outside of Ireland. That is not that I wish to trivialise the events depicted rather to state how much I know they are truthful in the general history of the once all powerful Catholic establishment in Ireland.By the way, if anyone doubts the authenticity of the content of this movie you should try your hardest to get your hands on the Channel 4 documentary (Sex in a Cold Climate) on which Mullan's film is based.

The film shows the girls talking in the dorm late at night but even this wasn't allowed in real life. Likewise, there were a number of suicides in the laundries but, for obvious reasons, these were hushed up by the nuns who didn't let on to the girls what had happened.On a second viewing of the film, it struck me as ironic that the Bishop should choose a showing of the picture \"The Bells of St Mary's\" for the girls and the nuns to watch. The film starred Ingrid Bergman as a nun, which seemed ideal casting at the time: however, Bergman was later to scandalise society by having an affair with the film director Roberto Rossellini and giving birth to his baby out of wedlock - had she been a young woman living in Ireland then, she might well have been sent to the laundry herself.",

However, the only true mark of a film is how well was the story told, acted, presented. Mullan excels in presenting a dark, claustrophobic film that originates with a beautifully shot intro that speaks volumes about social tradition and religion. The acting is top notch and as one reviewer so perfectly noted (I said the same thing before reading it so I don't feel bad about reiterating) Geraldine McEwan gives the best villainess performance since Nurse Ratchett. Some wonderfully shot scenes which will evoke Dreyer's Passion of Joan of Arc only from a different perspective.

            "content": "WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSThe Magdalene Sisters is a moving and heartbreaking account of the lives of four girls, incarcerated in a convent run by nuns of the Magdalene order in Northern Ireland.  I have seen this film several times and am more impressed at each viewing with the quality of the directing, the integrity of the performances and the realism and depth of the film.The greatest strength of the film is the richness of its portrayal.  It is textural and tactile.  The deep-coloured wood of the girls' bathroom can almost be felt under cold bare feet; the cold sun of Ireland and the coarseness of the girls' clothes seem to infiltrate the cinema.  The costumes were obviously designed to hide the girls' figures, not enhance them.  This lack of glamorization helps make the film believable.  Even in a scene where a row of women are shown naked, they are portrayed as objects of pity and not of desire.  The nuns, likewise, are presented neither as cardboard villains, nor as models of piety, but a mixture of each.  Repeated viewings reveal a backstory or character behind each nun-for example, the young Sister Jude, who never quite fits in with her colleagues and is always ill at ease.The quality of the acting is overall superb.  In a cast of unknowns, Dorothy Duffy as the gentle Rose and Nora-Jane Noone as the hard temptress Bernadette are particularly stunning.  The most brilliant performance of all is perhaps Eileen Walsh as Crispina-a simple but friendly girl who, under the harshness of the nuns' treatment and sexual abuse by a priest, ends up in a mental institution before dying of anorexia at the age of 24.Horrific though the treatment at Magdalene was, it is given greater power by being portrayed both subtly and boldly.  We see much of the horror through the innocent eyes of Rose, who never quite comes to term with any of it. Bernadette changes from a likeable, attractive girl into a hard, calculating girl whose determination does, however, eventually lead to her escape.  The character of Margaret also changes-no-one can remain unaffected in such a hostile environment.Interestingly, however, as the film condemns the practices of the Catholic Church, Rose is said to remain a devout Catholic all her life.  There is a hint of hope shown as she manages to separate the real truths of the Bible from the evil around her, which somehow changes this film from depressing to uplifting.  The Magdalene Sisters is still a tragedy-the film's final shot shows Crispina, not freeze-framed like the other girls but still staring into space mumbling as her history is relayed.  Before the final credits roll, the screen fills with row upon row of girls' names.  Each has a story; some perhaps ended happily, most in despair.  Even the victory gained by Margaret as she leaves the home in the custody of her brother is turned into defeat, when she kneels in terror before a nun lest she be sent back. \nMention should also be made of the beautiful soundtrack, which incorporates the haunting Irish sound flawlessly, and of the muted scenery which was used sparingly but effectively.  Peter Mullan's directing gave some scenes particular brilliance-the short, one-shot scene after Bernadette's hair was cut, for example, and Crispina's \u0091You're not a man of God!' scene which turned the ridiculous, incredibly, into the sublime.  Whether The Magdalene Sisters will prove successful at the Oscars due to the controversy surrounding the film is doubtful; it is, nonetheless, one of the most moving films of 2003, surpassing even The Pianist in terms of the portrayal of human suffering.",

Add to that list \"The Magdalene Sisters.\"Written and directed by Peter Mullan, the film takes a look at the Magdalene Laundries, an institution run by the Catholic Church in Ireland that began in the mid-1700s and continued until the last one was closed in 1996. \"Wayward\" and \"sinful\" girls were sent to these asylums, condemned to a life of slavery in the belief that it was the only way to cleanse their souls and keep them safe from temptation.  Often, these girls had committed no crimes except simply embarrassing their families or just being female.  30,000 women were sent to the laundries during their existence, many growing old and dying there.The film follows three young women, each one based on testimonials from survivors of the laundries.  Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff) was sexually assaulted by a cousin and dared to complain about it.  Rose (Dorothy Duffy) had a baby out of wedlock.  Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone) is merely a flirt, and there's never indication that she ever did anything more than tease anybody.  They are overseen by the iron-fisted Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan), a nun who calmly talks about how sinful she believes the girls to be while counting the profits from the laundries (the girls are never paid for their work).  The girls conspire to find a way to escape their confinement.The movie is a no-frills affair.  No special effects, no odd editing or camera angles, no high-profile action, not even much of a score.  This works in the film's favor, as we are allowed to focus on the amazing performances by the leads.  Most of the actresses are newcomers to the screen, while some are veteran British stage performers.  All give strong, searing performances that are both harsh in their realism and stunning in their depth.  It would be easy to cast Sister Bridget as a wicked tyrant, but even she has moments that reveal she may be an actual human and not simply an archetype.  The strongest performance comes from Noone, who plays Bernadette as a vulnerable soul with a fiery core that resists every attempt to subdue her and refuses to change who she is.  The plot of the film is minimal, and towards the end it devolves into something resembling a B-movie escape-from-prison routine.  However, plot is secondary again to the performances, which is the true reason to see the film.  The film is also very heavy-handed in its depiction of the corruption and cruelty of the Catholic Church, painting everything in broad strokes of black and white: the nuns are bad, the girls are good.  This is done to amplify the inherent malice of the institutions themselves, but it also serves to lessen the impact to those who most need to hear the message. It's dramatic polarization may lead some to discount it as sensational anti-Catholic propaganda (the Vatican has condemned the film, but nobody from the laundries has come forward to defend their behavior).This movie will make you angry, it will make you sad, it will make you hopeful.  It will take all of your emotions and multiply them by 10.  It will make you appreciate the craft of acting once again in a summer filled with empty action vehicles and vapid vanity films masquerading as character studies.  Most of all it will make you question the validity of organized religion and the twisted logic it inspires.  A fine film that should be seen by all.  8 out of 10.",

            "content": "I just saw this film at the New York Film Festival and was quite bowled away at its powerful indictment of a system that only breathed its last in 1996, but in its span, undoubtedly, wrecked the lives of the many women who were consigned to it.  The movie focuses on the semifictionalized lives of four young women, who are more sinned against than sinners and who are committed by their families or the Irish authorities to \"Magadalene Homes\" for \"wayward\" girls.  And once there, their unpaid labor is used to run a highly profitable laundry business that operated throughout Catholic Ireland. Mary Magadalene got salvation by washing the feet of Jesus with unguents; these young women are given much harder toil with lye soap and washboards. Unless they are somehow released by a family member, they may expect to spend their entire lives working for the Church, growing old and dying there. Indeed, we see one such woman who does so, having sadly \"bought in\" to the salvation of shame that the nuns peddle through humiliation and sadism.  Others on this page have commented on the performances of the young women, which are, without exception, laudable.  Perhaps the most affecting is that of Eileen Walsh as Crispina, a poor, simple-minded creature whose innate purity of soul is all the more vulnerable to rape, both literal and figurative. The most stunning performance comes, not unexpectedly, from Geraldine McEwan as Sister Bridget, the head of the convent.  She is an actress incapable of giving a bad performance, and is able, here, to inject some much needed drollery into a character whose behavior is mostly entirely reprehensible. Watch for her scene where she tells of her youthful love of the \"fill-um.\" I nearly pitied her when she cried along with that consummate example of film nuns, Ingrid Bergman.  Director Mullan makes one misstep in the tale, and that is at the very end.  In \"Animal House\"-like fashion we are told the eventual fates of the four young women.  I think that I would have preferred to have kept guessing about their eventual, semifictionalized lives.",

SPOILERS AHEAD. I could not get past the inconsistencies of the girls appearances. If their mortal sin is their sexuality, why are they in makeup and lipstick the entire film. Yes, a couple of characters are shown getting a head shaving, but moments later, a full head of hair has returned. Director Mullan has not gone far enough to show how harrowing conditions were at the asylum. Watch the accompanying documentary on the DVD entitled Sex in a Cold Climate for a far more detailed and compelling story.(done in a spare 48 min.)Finally I must mention a scene towards the end of the movie where the girls and nuns are treated to a viewing of the Bells Of St Mary's. During a compassionate speech by Ingrid Bergman, Mullan cuts to the girls who in unison turn their heads to Sister Bridget as tears well up in her eyes. Don't beat us over the head Peter, we get it. Ingrid Bergman good nun, Sister Bridget very bad. Clumsily handled. A disappointment to be sure.",

            "content": "Peter Mullan's (2002) film is based primarily upon the TV documentary 'Sex in a Cold Climate' by Steve Humphries which was first aired on RTE (Ireland) and BBC (England) in 1998. The documentary records the recollections of four Irish women who spent their youth and a good proportion of their adult lives as involuntary guests of uncompromising Roman Catholic nuns.The film is set in a particular example of this institution which, somewhat akin to the English workhouses of the late 19th and early 20th century, became established in Ireland after the Second World War. The Magdelene Laundries took their name from the biblical figure of Mary Magdalene, a 'fallen woman' whom Christ befriended.We join the main heroines of the movie - Margarette (Anne-Marie Duff), Bernadette (Norah-Jane Noone), Rose (Dorothy Duffy) and Crispina (Eileen Walsh) in cameo as their entrance scholarships for the Magdelene Laundry are being sat.What's most uncomfortable about this part of the movie, is trying to work out what's going on. Trying to work out what it is that's being whispered and what will be the upshot of it, and why. At first, it seems like the soundtrack of the film and the contrast have failed. But before long, it becomes obvious that the soundtrack of the film and the contrast have succeeded. The dark and deafening silence surrounding the circumstances under which these young women are being consigned to the unwelcome stewardship of the Magdalene Sisters comes through loud and muted.We follow their induction into the laundry by Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan), ably assisted by the Sisters Jude (Frances Healy), Clemantine (Eithne McGuinness) and Augusta (Phyllis MacMahon) who contrive with formally celibate gentlemen like Father Fitzroy (Daniel Costello) to represent a world in which God's greatest ideal is achieved through punishment and penitence.As the film progresses, we begin to understand why it is no accident that these institutions should have been laundries. They could - after all - have been bakeries, dairies, canneries or places where mailbags are sewn.With every garment that passes through the process, unmentionable filth is cleansed - if the Sisters are to be believed. And if the Sisters are to be believed, the sins of the teenagers and the route to Heaven is bound up in hot water, salt and flagellation.And as we follow these unsaintly girls on their hapless journey, we finally learn that salvation is as straightforward as a letter we are not privileged to read and a brother who arrives with a suitcase - as if there is anything that anybody could possibly want to carry away from a place like this.This film is a powerful elegy to the suffering of these unfortunate girls who, constrained to silence for so long, have finally found a voice.",

            "content": "**SPOILERS**Three cheers to Peter Mullan for telling this story.Yet another filthy and disgusting aspect of the sordid history of the Catholic Church comes to light.  In Ireland many young women who were seen as 'wayward' and 'impure' are sent away and imprisoned in Catholic laundries to repent their 'sins' and cleanse their souls.  Run by bullying Nuns who brutalise the girls both physically and mentally there was little chance of escape for those who were sent there, and indeed many women spent their entire lives in these laundries.  This film tells the stories of three young women who are sent to a Magdalene Asylum.  Margaret is raped by her cousin at a family wedding but is obviously seen as being a liability to her family.  Rose has had a baby out of wedlock, and is sent to the convent in disgrace after being forced by her parents and local priest to give up her son for adoption.  Bernadette is in an orphanage and flirts with the local boys, much to the concern of those who run the institution.  Once there we also meet Crispina, an unfortunate and simple minded soul who is brilliantly played by Eileen Walsh.The bulk of the story focuses on the tedium and brutality of the daily regime, and hopelessness of the situation the girls are in.  The Nuns are cruel, hypocritical and corrupt.  The priest is no better and takes advantage of his position.  I think the film also shows, quite well, how this kind of system so easily institutionalises the people in these kind of situations - captors as well as captives.  In one scene Margaret finds a gate carelessly left open.  She can escape, unseen, but chooses not to.  She is almost too afraid to leave the asylum.We eventually see a triumphant ending for a couple of the girls, and a tragic ending for another as she is sent away to a madhouse to keep her from telling tales.  This is one of the most harrowing scenes in the film, and stayed with me long after I had seen it.  However, what hurt the most is the knowledge that despite the escape of two girls, many more were left with no hope of any release whatsoever.This film is well written, well acted and very well shot.  At times the pace is slightly laboured and ponderous, with a couple of very heavy handed scenes which could have used a lighter touch - the same effect would have been achieved.  All in all though this is very highly recommended.",

The film finishes with unsettling and unforgettable stills of the four 'sisters' faces respectively, with their futures explained in text.It bears a close resemblance in mood to One Flew Over The Cookoos Nest, and Mother Superior could be compared to Nurse Ratched, both of which are belittling and sadistic.The fact that this is not fictitious is even more scary. On top of that, it's not even ancient history; the last asylum closed in 1996.Whether it was budget restraints or other reasons, I think that it was a wise decision not to cast big names in this film. It made it more real, somehow. It's isn't a terribly exciting film either, it kind of drags for the first half, but actually, because of this, it brings the torture of the environment home to us.

The Magdalene women have to bear up against sexual, physical and mental abuse in consequence for the sins they have committed.Those horrible scenes which show the inmates struggle to maintain honor and pride are as hard to watch as it is frustrating.

This movie is focusing on 4 girls, that were (and some still are) real persons, in this very real world, with the real story told in this movie! It shows how and why they have been put away, dumped is more correct in way even, in one of the laundries that were being run by the Magdalena Sisters in Ireland... You'll be more than shocked about the way they have been treated, and not to forget, about the absolutely absurd reasons why they've been put there! If you get raped, it will be hard enough already to handle that yourself, if you know it was your cousin who did it, it will only make it harder... But if you even get blamed for it and they take away several years of your life for it, it's amazing you're still alive after all that... This movie shows it in a beautiful hard way, no crap, no covering up or making it look better than it was, just the hard reality! And not to mention, how many people have been through the same hell... It's a bitter taste of hypocrisy, and a cold example of how people can get brainwashed when they're getting desperate, which has been used very well by the nuns to bind people forever into the laundries, until the day they die...For me there were some very nice pieces of acting, I think it must have been very hard for the actresses to keep in the role of desperate but also strong women, and even make it look like they were really living in it all! So I'd say, take an evening where nobody can interrupt or disturb you, pull out the telephone, turn of the cellar phone, close the curtains, and get shocked by reality...

This is another sad example of distributors casting aside a wonderful film and marketing it as something completely different.  The region 2 DVD labels this as an uplifting story about friends coming through all adversity.  THIS IS RUBBISH - there is not one uplifting moment in the entire film, but in no way should this distract from what is an important (if not masterful) film.  With the exception of a clever and original scene at a wedding at the beginning of the film Mullan's direction is far from inspired with clumsy camera angels and an apparent lack of confidence that means he needs to show us plot points twice when unneeded (key in Sister Bridgets room) and not well enough at others (second rape) but these minor flaws do not spoil a film carried by fine acting and an enormous story.  The girls are far from perfect (as the synopsis would have you believe) and while institutionalisation way or way not have influenced behaviour some of (most noticeably Bridgette's) decisions are dubious to say the least.  I would also dispute the films claim that Sister Bridget is \"monsterous\" - misguided and very, very wrong but it is important to remember that the nuns think they are doing for the best.  This is a film which raises yet more questions about the Catholic church and from that respect it is a film that must be seen.  However the music, dialogue and directorial imput is nothing special.  The characters are believable - but as real people that is to be expected!  If this had been a documentary, this way well have been a better piece of work but as that may not have been possible and for the sheer impact that the film provides this works fine, and should be watched not for the sake of enjoyment, but for the sake of education and information.8/10",

            "content": "This is a well crafted piece of period drama reflecting accurately the sense of hidden despair of a 1960's Ireland held in the grip of a punishing religious autocracy, whilst also displaying the physical beauty of the land. A handful of moments of light humour provide scant relief from what otherwise makes for harrowing viewing. It follows the events in the life of 3 female adolescents who are banished to the confines of a `restorative' wash house convent ran by catholic nuns.  The girl's `sins', the reason for their incarceration, range from flirting with boys to being the victim in a consanguineous rape. The misery of what is to unfold is suggested right from the outset by the melody of the drumbeat in the openings scene where a priest plays at a working class wedding, where clues that this is a joyous occasion are few and far between. Events quickly degenerate to a brief rape scene.  The disclosure of this and its terrible consequences is portrayed in a novel stylistic way.  The dialogue is never heard by the audience but the gravity of the situation is clearly apparent by the facial expressions and body language of the recipients of the information in an upwards spiral ascending the seniority and social standing of the figures in the small community. The next spoken word comes some days later from the girl's younger brother who cries `Da', where are they taking our Margaret?'.  This sets the scene for the rest of the film where there is minimal dialogue for the simple reason that the girls are very rarely allowed to speak.  This does detract to some extent from the movie as a spectacle but is compensated to a large degree by fine performances from a young cast of relative unknowns. The deep sense of injustice in Margaret's situation is quickly compounded by the stories of the other two girls and most of the rest of the action takes place in the austere confines of the nunnery. Geraldine McEwan plays an evil villain of Shakespearean proportions with her misguided henchwomen and helpers running her a close second.  They rule the girls in dictatorial fashion with ritual humiliation and brutal beatings. The girls themselves are driven to despair, attempted suicide and even insanity. It is a powerful piece of drama which engenders an intense sense of despair and injustice but never really provides the satisfaction of the villains getting there just deserts. Although, of course, that was never the director's intention and if revenge movies are more your bag then I guess you would be unlikely to leave the rental store with this disc. Some impact of the movie is lost as there is little sense of balance and much confusion over what is fact and what is fiction. The discovery that the outcome information on the characters given with the end credits left me feeling a little cheated. Although, the revelation that the last of these washhouses closed in only 1996 was a sobering thought.",

It's the story of three girls (one calm and intelligent, the second one impatient and rebellious, the third endearing and sensitive) who, regarded as sinners by the Irish society, are sent to the convent of Magdalene to atone their sins; in fact, the nuns not only use them for doing the laundry, but also take pleasure in humiliating them in all possible ways. And, what's worse for the poor girls, it will be forever.THUMBS UP TO: all the camera close-ups, two intense moments (both with Margaret) and Bernadette (for lending some blood and spirit of initiative to the movie; who said Irish people are all paralytic?). And it's a true story.THUMB DOWN TO: two bursts of emotion seemed gratuitous to me (Rose in the beginning and Crispina in the end receiving sudden awareness of everything).

            "content": "I have found this to be a compelling movie, in several ways. The viewer will be astounded by the realistic quality of this picture, which clearly conveys the pains of being confined in one of these church-run companies.\nIn short, the film is about three young ladies, stigmatized by the 1960's Irish society as \"wayward\" and in need of penance. To this avail they are confined by their own parents or superiors in these Magdalene laundries, ran by nuns and clerics, where they are to do \"voluntary\" tough manual labor, for indefinite periods of time. The brutality of their serfdom contrasts with the insignificance of their \"sins\": to have premarital relations, to flirt with boys, or to give birth to children out of wedlock. Progressively the script turns away from the pains of their labor and towards the decadent, unholy way in which \"religious\" characters behave.It must be admitted that these actresses are praiseworthy in performing their roles masterfully and with tremendous skill--some of their characters earning the viewers' sympathy in spite of their being oftentimes detestable. In a sense, then, the movie escapes the typical \"tales of woe\" of victims and victimizers; everybody seem to have as much of both--pounding on themselves and on others--so that we are presented with a vivid picture of hell--rather than of purgatory.Being a Roman Catholic, however, the point of the movie seems to me rather ambivalent. On the one hand I would encourage other Catholics to watch this film and the denunciation it makes, for history has proven time and again that what goes around comes around easily. Catholics, more than anyone else, should be wary of the abuses of power and the moral corruption of its clergy, and avoid at all costs to hide the sun with their hands. Also, as a religious person one could appreciate the paradox hereby presented, and which is not easily solved: as Augustine once said, \"nothing good remains good when forced\"--but also, as he said elsewhere, \"all heretics should be executed\"--hoping that if he himself went astray a severe, faithful church would \"take care\" of him. As the film shows, the line between taking severe measures for the right cause and ruining someone's life by taking away his or her freedom is seldom clear.On the other hand, there is something repulsive and not believable about the movie, and not at all edifying--and this is why I cannot really recommend it to most of the people I know. In portraying the \"tyrant\" church which nobody knows, the movie shows a church that probably doesn't exist, presenting \"religious\" people that have absolutely nothing religious about them. Pressure is constantly put under the viewer's religious mores, oftentimes unnecessarily--as when one of the girls receives communion after having given the priest a blow job. In addition, every single nun and priest in the movie, without exception, is evil, whether in being petty, or greedy, or merciless, or sexually perverted. Their \"religious\" vocation is portrayed as the vocation of \"being a jailer,\" or a \"Capitalist factory owner,\" or even a \"slave owner.\" Sister Bridget at some point claims that if she had not been a nun she would have gone to America and become a cowgirl--as if her \"call\" for life was that of rearing livestock anyway.  On this score the film unfortunately falls flat on its face, being reminiscent to me of Nazi tales where all Jews per being Jews are evil. Such a merciless, unrealistic display of the religious life is utterly misleading, especially to those outside Catholicism.",

The aim is only to show the horrors of life in Ireland in 20th century but the movie is not anti-religious though it could be because the subject suits the anti-god thoughts perfectly(anyway,it's better to watch \"My Summer of Love\"). This one is like historical or documentary film-nothing more. You can see in it,if you are able to, that everywhere(not only in Ireland!)people are made slaves by Church and Government. It's the horrifying law of life. All of this movie's heroes made me sick,because everyone but prisoners were non-human creatures and the girls were no more but sheeps. It's impossible to resist fascism but at least you must not indulge it! You have your own head and your own brain,so think! But they didn't want to..And I want to ask the question:When you live in Hell,how can you continue believing in god? Why does every girl in Magdalene's prison believe the words of the people who subject them to tortures? Why don't they understand that there is no god and they are not sinners-they are the victims of cruel humanity? The society they lived in manipulated them,manipulated their minds but the victims were also killing themselves because they totally obeyed. Someone escaped from this prison but they didn't escape their faith and that is what kept them slaves until the end of their days.Well,anyway it's worth seeing because it's useful,especially for Christians...7 out of 10",

I wonder if the writer was a misandrist. The closest thing to a decent male character was Margaret's brother, who inquired where she was being taken at the beginning, and rescued her at the end (for which he was unfairly lambasted by her for taking too long to grow up). A close second was the fellow who almost helped Bernadette escape (despite his very crude behavior when first introduced).In terms of being anti-Catholic, it certainly wasn't purely so, as I could discern areas where they tried to show a few of the nuns as having some concern for their charges (in between beatings and humiliations).When I learned that one of the women in the documentary commented that things were much worse than the film portrayed, it made me wonder whether that was simply her perception, or whether it was accurate. I find it hard to believe that all those nuns had been turned into the moral equivalent of Nazi prison guards. What was believable was that the women who endured that treatment were unable afterwards to form harmonious marriages, and some avoided marriage altogether, to avoid letting anyone ever again have that kind of power over them.Anyway, I enjoyed watching first the hour-long documentary, and the next night the film itself. If you're prone to bouts of depression, though, hide the razor blades, and think how far we've advanced since those dark times, not so very long ago.",

I decided that I just couldn't take any more of it about an hour through it when in about 4 consecutive scenes I was able to predict the next occurrence simply by asking \"Gee, whats the worst thing that could happen to her or what is the most evil thing the nun could do?\" and sure enough thats what would happen, making for a completely unenjoyable movie.

It is because of these \"sins\" that Margaret, Bernadette and Rose (beautifully played by Anne-Marie Duff, Nora-Jane Noone and Dorothy Duffy, respectively) find themselves at a Magdalene asylum with dozens of other women with similar stories.The alleged purpose of the Magdalene asylum is to reform society's wayward women - but it seems much more like a highly profitable sweatshop. Draconian nuns (led by the spectacular Geraldine McEwan) run the asylum like a business, where the indentured servants - oops, I mean the \"sinners\" - are forced to work or pray every waking hour, endure physical and psychological abuse, and engage in humiliating and demeaning acts at the nuns' (and, occasionally, a visiting priest's) whim.While Rose's docile compliance is sweet but frustrating, viewers will wholly sympathize with Margaret's fury and the beautiful Bernadette's repeated acts of rebellion.  But the most touching and disturbing (if at times overacted) portrayal is that of Crispina (Eileen Walsh) - a funny-looking, dim-witted young woman who seems to want nothing more than to please her captors. Given the recent negative press surrounding Catholic leaders, Catholicism's PR department is undoubtedly wringing its hands over this movie and asking itself, \"Why now?\"",

They go on to praise the movie for its honesty and great acting, making us identify with the women and feel outrage at what was done to them. All of this is true. But _The Magdalene Sisters_ can also be appreciated as women in prison / nun - exploitation movie - perhaps the best of such movies ever made! By the usual standards of such movies is rather restrained: there is no hot metal torture as in Franco's classic \"Love Letters of a Portugese Nun\", nor topless floggings as in \"The Sinful Nuns of St. Valentine,\" no live pig nastiness as in \"Flavia the Heretic,\" but the realism conveyed by the restraint makes the movie much more frightening to me. This really happened, and (some of ) the men and women of the Catholic Church who did it are still alive and probably still in positions of authority. The brit region 2 version (not sure about USA version) of the DVD has a documentary feature, \"Sex in a Cold Climate\" that served as inspiration for the drama. It consists of interviews with middle aged and old women who were once Magdalene inmates, and is to me more frightening (though less fun as WIP movie of course.) than the drama. I highly recommend it, and also the director's commentary which I think is missing from the USA DVD.I realize some people will object to my classifying this movie as a NUNEX/WIP because it is \"too good\" to be entertainment, in the same way some refuse to classify \"Shaft\" as BLAX. Such judgments are a matter of personal taste and argument is probably not fruitful. But to women in prison movie fans who have been avoiding seeing MS because it sounds too dark and serious, I suggest they consider seeing it, for both the fun genre elements and the inspiring acting by the women prisoners and the evil Big Matron guard/mother superior who is also a famous brit actress. Unfortunately in these politically correct times, straightforward fun women in prison movies do not get general distribution in the USA. If one wants to encourage the creation of quality high budget WIP movies, supporting films like MS may be the best thing fans can do in our current dark age.",

The subject matter is controversial--many whose experience with the Catholic Church was different than this, would not bother to watch this, and thus would not be commenting here--nevertheless the storyline is intriguing.Secondly, I am neither Catholic nor someone who believes that the Pope is God's representative on earth. Not everything the Catholic Church has done is evil. The thread that I keep hearing, that this movie is adapted from a true story, gives me just reason not to blindly accept it's premise. It's not that I doubt the basic facts of the story--after all, there was a Spanish Inquisition and priest pedophiles--it's just that sometimes facts are omitted or the truth is embellished for the purpose of emphasizing one point or another. The fact that most of you would accept the posit of a movie like this, that may or may not have an underlying motive, leads me to believe that many of you want to believe the events that take place in this movie as factual, without any corroborating evidence other than the comments of the director, writers, and other people here.As a third point, I wish to address anyone who makes a comparison with the very anti-woman, anti-Chrisitan, anti-modern, anti-art, anti most everything Taliban, with the Catholic Church, or for that matter, any fundamental Christian group.

The moral looseness of our society, which began primarily in the 60's, is not a good yard-stick to use to make comparisons with other cultures.Because some believe in the sanctity of the marriage bed, or believe that fornication and adultery are wrong, doesn't mean they are backward Neanderthals. It means that their values, although different from the flow in this country, mean something to them, and pretty much go along with the morays of most other societies.",

I thought he was a bit in a strange mood, but when I saw the movie, I understood. Peter Mullan 's (he plays the father that takes back his ex-daughter Uma at Magdalene)direction is his clinical point of view. No music over, no concessions, close-ups as a religion (sorry about that !) You're watching, stunned by the atrocity of the events (and I suppose that some he didn't wanna show were even worse)and never the director condamns any of its characters, that was like that, everyone had their reasons.I'm usually very sensitive with those kinds of true drama type of movies and could have cried half the movie, but no, I couldn't, not that I couldn't empathize with the characters, on the contrary, but out of respect and shock probably. Home, that's were the tears came.If you're feeling blue, go and see it, it will cheer you up against your will. If you're feeling in the clouds and a bit proud of yourself, go and see it, it will take you down to earth with a great and sane brutality. Anyway, any state, anyone, go and see it !

            "review_title": "Are the Magdalene sisters 'Qing Lou' sisters?",
            "content": "The first point that drew my attention to watch this film was because of the Chinese translation of its name. The meaning of the Chinese translation is ' the sisters from a Qing Lou'. I don't know who translated this name in the first place and I don't know why the Magdalene asylum, which is labelled as a religious place to take in women who are morally decadent, got replaced by the brothel from the translator's point of view. Therefore, I would like to bring this question with me throughout the review writing of this film.First of all, what is this place-- the Magdalene asylum? It is a real place rather than a fictional environment. The magdalene asylum is also known as 'Magdalene Laundries', a for-profit organisation run by Catholics in Ireland. In this place, Catholic nuns are managers because they teach and arrange women there to do laundry works. The nuns are supervisors because they monitor how the women work and make clear about working rules, such as 'no talk while work'. The nuns are teachers as well as part-time hairdressers because they cut the women's hair when they try to educate them. The nuns are game judges because they ask the women to stand nakedly in a row and comment on the women's breasts and pubic hairs. The nuns are actually film promoters because they play a film about nuns to celebrate Jesus' birthday and everyone is there to watch. So what kind of role are the nuns not related at all in the Magdalene laundries? I am certain about one answer that they are not morally decadent people like the women there. Why? Maybe it is because they believe in god, or maybe it is because they have dedicated their life into a sacred career, or maybe it is because they seem not to have any sexual contact with anyone, or you can tell me another reason.Then I shall compare the Magdalene laundries with a Qing Lou to try to understand the translator's perspective. A brothel in Chines culture, procuresses are managers and teachers because they arrange prostitutes' work and skills. However, they are not supervisors as they don't stay in the same room and watch the prostitutes working. They are not hairdressers neither, maybe it is because a bald prostitute may not make many profits for them. They can be game judges though, and the game could be similar in terms of private parts of female bodies.In this sense, the Magdalene asylum is a Qing Lou in terms of the women there make profits for the nuns and the nuns are judging the women upon their appearances. However, while I am writing this review I found that maybe there is another interpretation of the Chinese name for this movie, as Qing Lou originally was not regarded as a brothel.In Chinese culture, one of the original meanings about 'Qing Lou' refers to a place where is elaborately decorated and people with high-social status lived in. Women who lived in Qing Lou were a bunch of people with talents. It seems like 'Qing Lou' starting to be closely connected with brothel was after Tang Dynasty. In relation to this original meaning of 'Qing Lou', the Chinese name of this movie sounds more inappropriate because the women in the Magdalene asylum are not people with privileges.So who are those women in the Magdalene asylum? They could simply be an ordinary country woman, who were unfortunately raped on her family relative's wedding; They could be a young mother, who decided to give birth to a kid even though the father had already gone; they could be a teenage girl, who flirted with boys; they could be a woman, who seemed behave differently but that did not present any threatening to other people and instead she was enthusiastic in helping other people. These are some examples of the women in the Magdalene asylum. They were put into the religious facility and locked from outside. So why them? and what sent these women to the Magdalene asylum? The answer is they are 'morally decadent'. Even though the country woman did not give the consent to the rape and tried to tell other family members in order to get the justice; even though the young mother tried to take care of the new baby and begged her parents to not send the baby away; even though the teenage girl didn't not actually make love with anyone. So why them? and what sent these women to the Magdalene asylum? my understanding is the societal bias against women. To some people, this answer may be obvious. Why the victims got sanctioned by the social morale? Why a struggling single parent got sanctioned by family honour? why a teenage girl who is in a sex curious period that's determined biologically got sanctioned by religious rules? maybe there are different interpretations including gender bias.From this perspective, the Chinese name of this movie itself can be regarded as a gender bias, as the women in the Magdalene asylum are not sex workers, neither did they belong to a high social class. I am still trying hard to understand the translator's perspective and came out with this potential explanation-- could the translator try to refer that the women who lived in Qing Lou were a bunch of talented females, however, they had to entertain or serve high-classed people with their talents and gradually even with their bodies. In this understanding, I feel like that there is a sense of pity from outsiders towards the Qing Lou women. This pity also brings me a feeling of hopelessness that the pity is the evidence that high-class people can exploit lower-class people, and it would be the lower-class people who receive the judgement and a sigh of pity. In this way, the gender bias is exacerbated in the class bias.At the end, I would like to say that I may not be able to figure out the translator's intention and I don't care about the translator's intention. I feel angry not only because the Chinese translation does not reflect the real meaning of the movie but also it represents the bias that this movie fights against. I am thinking maybe it is not that bad for such kind of name may attract more people to watch the movie, for instance, I was also attracted by the name in the first place. Would an ordinary name as ' the Magdalene sisters' attract you?",

They are only common people.They are not divine. But it's still a little bit blurred by its controversial and violent way of shooting. Sometimes the main idea was covered by the director's self-indulgent violence. The audience were so excited about the finale,like the film \"Dogville\".

Like a criminal, these young women are forced to be confined to a seven day a week relentless work schedule at the laundry. The things these women endure make the grit of prison life in \"Oz\" seem like summer camp. The movie is set in the 60s and our three leads attempt to follow the rules but are utterly aware the next step for them is to have their soul crushed by the monster Nuns. Unwilling to be broken down, the women take matters into their own hands. Played by Anne-Marie Duff and Nora-Jane Noone, the two main characters are given life with harrowing conviction. That this sort of thing went on in Ireland for decades is only less scary when I discovered that the practice of these \"Magdalene Sister\" laundries were a very real aspect of Irish life until as recently as 1996. There's no happy endings in this movie. Each character has their own destiny, not all are the triumphant feel-good variety but then this isn't a movie of simply escaping the \"bad guys\", rather, this is about being in a bad situation and gathering the strength and courage to do something about it.",
