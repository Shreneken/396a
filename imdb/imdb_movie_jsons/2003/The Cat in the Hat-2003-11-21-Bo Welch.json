            "content": "I really liked Jim Carrey as the Grinch, so I thought I might as well give another popular Dr. Seuss starring another great comedy actor a chance. Basically brother and sister Sally (The War of the World's Dakota Fanning) and Conrad (Spencer Breslin) are two bored (and grounded) children home alone (besides the goldfish and Amy Hill as Mrs. Kwan), and Mom (Razzie nominated Kelly Preston) wants them to behave, stay clean, but above all, do not enter the living room, or else! Soon after she has left, The Cat (Razzie nominated Mike Myers) shows up to show them that they can have fun. They first sign a contract to ensure that they can have all the fun they want, and no mess (which obviously there will be), and this is when the chaos starts. Also starring Razzie nominated Alec Baldwin as Quinn, Sean Hayes as Mr. Humberfloob and the Fish's voice, Frank Welker as Nevins, Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as Kate the Caterer, Paris Hilton as Female Club-Goer and narrated by Victor Brandt. Myers may have his funny moments, and the film may be colourful, but the problems I have are: it is a bit too zany at times, the Things (Danielle Ryan Chuchran, Taylor Rice, Brittany Oaks and Talia-Lynn Prairie, all voiced by Dan Castellaneta) are slightly irritating doing the opposite of what you say, and it is just too much to take in. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Director for Bo Welch, Worst Screenplay, Worst Screen Couple for Mike Myers and either Thing One or Thing Two and Worst Excuse for an Actual Movie (All Concept/No Content!). Adequate!",

            "review_title": "This cat in the Hat need to be put to sleep for spitting out this awful hairball.",
            "content": "Honestly, I'm probably one of the very few people that like the movie, 2000's real life version of How to The Grinch Stole Christmas. So when I heard that Cat in the Hat was being made, my first thought, was OK, I hope it's as good as the Grinch which I thought was decent. I saw The Cat in the Hat recently and I was amazed at how inappropriate it was. It's disgusting! It was a pastel colored nightmare that I hope I never have to sit through again. Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat is the worst of all the Dr. Seuss movies so far. This film is awful. I really had doubts how they were going to fit in, a short book into a 2 hour movie, and when I saw that scary clown mutant cat dressed and play by Mike Myers that looks more like a child molester of Ronald McDonald in a furry costume, I knew this movie was going was going to be hard to watch. It's so evil looking that the some kids after seeing him in that awful makeup. The movie has lots of naughty jokes like there's a scene where the cat stares Kelly Preston's boobs and the cat pumps up his hat in an erection matter. Then there is butt cracks jokes, as well awful sexual puns. It's like they forgot it's a kid's movie. Let's not forget the scene where the cat got hit over his balls with a fantasy plot point of the cat wearing a drag with sparkles of unicorn? Kill me. Another thing is that film is so lazy that it rushed for adding more plot stories to the point it's not even like the book. The book is pretty simple. It features a tall, anthropomorphic, mischievous cat, wearing a tall, red and white-striped hat and a red bow tie. Here, Mike Myers is not a tall cat, but a fat bobcat hybrid. In the book, the Cat brings a cheerful, exotic and exuberant form of chaos to a household of two bored, loneliness, and friendless young children, brother and sister, one rainy day while their mother leaves them unattended. In the movie, Conrad (Spencer Breslin) is a destructive and misbehaved 12-year-old brat and Sally Walden (Dakota Fanning) dull, well-behaved, and rule-obeying 8-year-old daughter, so unlike their characters in the book. The only problem about changing the characters, is why did they created two of most unlikeable children ever. I would rather have the loneliness children of the book since that is how we, the readers can related to. Mike was honored to play the cat in the hat because of how much he loved the book. Well, he doesn't act like the Cat in the book as he even states that he can't rhyme. Cat in the Hat can't rhyme? It's like if Sam I am can't make Green Eggs and Ham. It's doesn't make sense. Instead, we get Cat's personality goes beyond simple homewrecking a-hole. Poor Mike Myers, he sounds like he miss misses his old career at SNL. Obviously, the jokes, scenes, and impressions all look like rejected Saturday Night Live skits in this film. Before I forget, Adam Baldwin is in the film as the villain Larry Quinn, who wants to send Conrad to military school to solve his destructive ways and marry his mother Joan (Kelly Preston) for her wealth. I don't know what wealth, because in the film, the mother seem like a low-paying real-estate agent who boss Mr. Humberfloob (Sean Hayes) fired people who leave a mess due to Obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder. Sean Hayes also plays the fish in the story. He is barely mention in the film, which is so unlike in the book, where he is the orderly protagonist to Cat in the Hat chaotic antagonist. There wasn't no need for Larry Quinn or Mr. Humberfloob in this movie. Yeah, it didn't feel like Cat in the Hat anymore, or at least the one I grew up. Yes, neither did \"The Grinch\" as everyone else says, but I felt like that movie could get away with some of the things they did to some extent because, well, it's the Grinch. He's mean, cold-hearted, and was willing to destroy a well-loved holiday just because he wanted to make everyone else miserable, and adding that back story to him, gave us a reason to feel for him, he wasn't really a monster. In Cat in the Hat, the Cat is just awful. In here, you have rubbery fast-paced special effects. The music and singing that pretty damn bland. There were a few moments that got a small laugh, I felt like there was a lot of things Mike did as the Cat that I don't think the Cat would do like swear in front of children. Yeah, you really put it into words best: the attempts at being more adult, relevant, and meaningful just make it more obnoxiously juvenile, dated, and pointless in the end. This film represents everything wrong with kid adaption movies. I know that Dr. Seuss estate even sued Hollywood to prevent any more live-action movies of his books due to this movie. I have to agree. The biggest insult, this film had was a dumb cameo by Paris 'I really wish she never existed' Hilton. What an abomination! I agree that this whole movie is one big sellout, and they plug Universal Studios Florida and other products in the film. Growing up I adored the books Seuss wrote. They taught me to read and properly emote. When I read such stories and things before bed, it made me call up fanciful things in my head. This movie is crap, and I'm proud to say, I'd rather watch the cartoon version any day.",

            "content": "This movie was really painful to watch. It was an extremely busy and annoying movie without anything funny or original ever happening. The humor was just completely wrong and totally unfunny.The story is just basically about nothing and only serves as an opportunity for Mike Myers to show his silly antics on the screen. He is however given awful material to work with and an awful imagine-less director to direct him. The movie is annoyingly fast paced at times and it relies to heavily on just Mike Myers. Alec Baldwin does play an enjoyable and good 'villain' and they could had really used him better in this movie. There are really some missed opportunities here...OK I have to admit that there are some good and funny moments but really not enough to save this movie from being a disaster.I did liked the visual style in this weird typical fabricated world with all those weird looking sets and colors. It really reminded me of the Tim Burton movie \"Edward Scissorhands\". No wonder it did, director Bo Welch worked on \"Edward Scissorhands\" as the production designer. Unfortunately the visual style is underused and doesn't play a significant enough role in the movie. While watching this movie I really kept on wishing that Tim Burton would had directed this movie with perhaps starring Johnny Depp, how perfect would that had been?I don't see how anyone could like this movie and I most certainly can not recommend this movie to anyone, especially not to children. If this was a movie made for children than it was done completely wrong. There is nothing to enjoy or find imaginative in this annoying, loud, too fast paced mess of a movie, that has totally no story and a wobbly message in it.3/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

            "content": "Dr. Seuss's stories are funny and charming, and some of them like How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Horton Hears a Who have been made into surprisingly good films.(Jim Carrey was brilliant as the Grinch but the animated short is a wonderful timeless classic) However, Cat in the Hat is just a joke of a film. I saw it with four of my friends at the cinema for my 12th birthday 5 or 6 years ago, and all of us hated it.The main problem is the casting of Mike Myers, or miscasting more like. He was good as Austin Powers and Shrek, but his performance as the Cat was beyond cringe worthy. There were times when he had a preposterous Scottish accent that didn't suit him at all(it sounded nothing like the voice he used on Shrek), and all the Cat had to do was make terrible fart jokes, and sing songs with lyrics that were impossible to decipher.The script was terrible, full of fart jokes and clich\u00e9d one liners. Kids are most unlikely to laugh at the overused bathroom humour, they will a find it unfunny, or b find it offensive. None of the 5 of us laughed once in this movie, other than when the Cat was singing.The film does have two redeeming qualities. One is some nice scenery in the latter half of the film. The other is Dakota Fanning, who was the only actress in the film who made some effort to make her character true to the story. Kelly Preston was okay, and Alec Baldwin is very good in films like the Shadow and Hunt For Red October, but in films like this and Thomas and the Magic Railroad, he is completely wasted as the villain.All in all, a lifeless and unfunny film. It isn't quite as abysmal as Home Alone 4, but it is really awful. I am sorry if I have offended anyone, I genuinely hate criticising movies, but Cat in the Hat really did take the biscuit. 1/10 for the scenery and Fanning. Bethany Cox",

            "content": "I assumed that \"The Cat in the Hat\" was most likely a terrible film, as it's currently #79 on IMDB's infamous Bottom 100. This inclusion is recent, as the website changed its parameters for admission to the list to only include more commonly seen films. Before this, films with only a few dozen scores could make the list...now it only includes movies which were rated by at least 1500 users. This change means that many Hollywood films are now on a list which previously was inundated with more independent features. Most of the films newly to the list are dreadful....but being a bad film junkie, I am a glutton for punishment! Going into the film I assumed it would be bad but was willing to give it a chance...like I enjoyed \"The Flintsones in Viva Rock Vegas\" (currently #70, though I enjoyed it and scored it a 6).So is the film bad? Absolutely. In fact, it's horrible and painful to watch. There are two main reasons for this. First, the original Dr. Seuss story was very brief and a movie based on it might only last 10 minutes. So, the studio added a lot....and much of what they added (such as the obnoxious boss and the obnoxious neighbor) was just annoying. Second, not to be outdone by these additions, Mike Myers made his character, the Cat, truly obnoxious and hateful. He talks almost non-stop when so often the film would have worked better had he just shut up! A few times, his prattling was also very child un-friendly--with crude commments that most kids wouldn't understand and a shot to the groin that shouldn't be in a kids movie in the first place?! The bottom line is that the film is annoying and dreadful instead of being fun...and the original story was all about kids meeting a cat who was a lot of fun. In many ways, the film is much like an endurance contest that dares you to turn it off....it's THAT bad. By comparison, Myer's \"Love Guru\" is practically a Truffaut masterpiece!!Parents...think twice about letting your children see this movie...it might just make them stupider...particularly if they like it! Also, after the movie was over, my wife (who had slept though almost the entire movie) said \"Why was that movie so LOUD?!\"....I couldn't have said it much better myself!",

            "content": "Dog the Grinch if you must, but it was LIGHT YEARS ahead of this muddled mess!! They were so worried about Carrey coloring the role of the Cat in the Hat, that they hired an actor who has one basic personality which he dresses with different costumes. This was nothing more than Mike Meyer's \"Dr. Evil\" character in a cat suit. He uses the self same gimmicks in his shtick as the maniacally irresponsible Cat, as he did as the irresponsibly maniacal Dr. Evil. There's very little difference between the two and what difference there was, he comes off as a very poor comic this time around.The creation of the city was quite nice and Dakota Fanning was a joy. The boy who played her brother and the fish were decent characters, but Mike Meyers' interpretation of Dr. Seuss's Cat was extremely sickening. He was very under dramatized (and must have been cememted in \"Dr. Evil\") for Cat in the Hat. While Dr. Evil was a likable character in the Austin Powers movies, he had no place in this work. Hindsight being worthless, they should have hired Jim Carey and not been concerned with the \"Grinch\" comparisons. He, at least, would have played DR. SEUSS'S character and not Mike Meyers' character.The Universal Studios ad right in the middle of the movie was the least tasteful thing in a virtual sea of tastelessness. I actually PAID to see a Universal advertisement. I have just been violated. No. Really. Ah well, this will be remade in a few years, anyway. It rates a 1/10 from...the Fiend :.",

The acting it the worst: even Mike Myers couldn't redeem this stinker post-Shrek. And besides all that? There's nothing else. The music is less than memorable as well.

The kids' mother/real estate agent (Kelly Preston) is hardly around at all. Ditto for sleazy neighbor Alec Baldwin (What in the world is he doing in this picture?) as he has the hots for Preston, gives the cold shoulder to the children and loses his cool when he sees Myers. Film-maker Bo Welch is an art director by trade and the production is clearly obvious and in-your-face due to that fact as the sets are elaborately built and painted over with every oddball color you can imagine. Myers' makeup job can be looked upon as revolutionary, spooky or a total failure.

'The cat in the hat' is filled with zip, zest, and pizzazz, and 100% bereft of personality, heart, or intelligence. Every now and again there's a moment that represents a fleeting bit of cleverness, yet these are outnumbered, overwhelmed, and rendered irrelevant by a nearly endless stream of attempted \"humor\" that's abjectly juvenile, sometimes altogether scatological, low, cheap, and boorish; moreover, no few lines or gags are far too adult for a PG feature. There is scant meaningful sense of comedic timing as the picture rushes from one senseless bit to another, with the regular center of attention of course being Mike Myers, going overboard with over the top overacting that's intended to be wacky fun but is only ever empty-headed, obnoxious, and overbearing. Kids are smarter than we give them credit for, and the last thing a family-friendly film should ever do is talk down to its target audience, yet this never does anything but exactly that, substituting pure, utmost bluster for any modicum of thought or reason. This is fundamentally vulgar and insulting to children, to adults, to movie audiences everywhere, to anyone who has ever been involved with making movies, to Dr. Seuss, and not least, to those who were involved in making this. Well and truly, 'The cat in the hat' is an abomination.Perfectly, unremittingly insipid as this is, it's impossible to care about the hard work of the crew who endeavored so mightily to bring the picture to life. Production design, art direction, costume design, hair and makeup, effects - all very imaginative, or at least representative of careful craftsmanship. It's not the fault of anyone behind the scenes that their contributions were bent toward such absolute, mindless, unlikable inanity. This is, however, just what we get. In every last regard this is the opposite of fun, the opposite of humor - awful, asinine foolishness that's all style and no substance, all flash and no function. I'm plainly embarrassed for all who got dragged into participating in the creation of this balderdash - and for myself, for making the choice to watch even though I knew better.It doesn't matter who you are, or what you think you're going to get out of seeing this. You are mistaken. There is no value herein. No one should ever watch 2003's 'The cat in the hat,' and that's all there is to it.",

It's nothing but crass-commercialism wrapped in pretty art direction (especially the plug for Universal Studios theme park which was really stupid). Especially annoying is Mike Myer's entire time on screen, he can't decide who the Cat is: a Borscht-belt comedian or a lousy imitation of Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion.  Not that it really matters anyway, Myers is painful to watch simply because he expects everyone to love him, so why bother to try and create a memorable character?  There are two unnecessary sub-plots with characters not even in the original book, an incredible amount of smutty toilet humor that must have poor Dr. Suess turning in his grave, and worst of all is the ending in which the children \"learn a lesson\" about being behaved, good, and considerate.  The book's wonderful chaos ended well without anyone, i.e. adults, having a clue what went on that rainy day!  This movie should put would-be director Bo Welch out of the business.

Worst of all, the funny parts are supposed to be those that have the mild adult themes. I thought this was a FAMILY movie, not a sex comedy! I guess only those kids who are spoiled and are used to nudity & porn will like this movie. There is a cameo appearance by Paris Hilton, who has done a sex video before. Maybe those kids who watched her sex tape will love seeing her dance suggestively in this movie. They would also love the mild sexual jokes, since they would understand them. It is sickening to think about the young children knowing about all this adult stuff at a young age.The cat himself is very annoying. It seems that the filmmakers were trying to make him scary & funny at the same time. They were probably thinking of creating the cat as a Freddy Krueger carbon copy. Freddy is one thousand times funnier than this lame cat. In fact, Freddy could slice him up any time. I would get more laughs that way.And lastly, of course, this film has nothing to do with the Dr. Seuss books. It's no wonder that the fans of the Dr. Seuss series were angry at this movie. If I was a fan of those books, I would be angry too.To sum up, this film was really an insult to Dr. Seuss, to nursery rhymes, and to comedy itself.

My reaction to the film then grew colder.Many know the story of 2 kids bored on a rainy day and all that, and how they meet that creature named The Cat In The Hat.The movie follows the poem by the great Dr. Suess, but it adds so much that the term \"adaptation\" seems loose. There's a germaphobe boss who does nothing for the plot, a neglectful babysitter and Alec Baldwin's character who does not like the boy a lot.There are many complaints I could make about this 80 minute film that's defiled, but most of all this Dr. Suess film is not for any child.There's a scene where Cat sees a picture of the Mom and the film goes in a perverted direction. His tail goes up and his hat gets an erection.In one scene Cat chops his tail and in a joke not so rich, there's a censor as he says \"Son of a...\" well, the word- you know which.We see a fake butt, jokes about sex, and so much more that you'd rather not know, but worst of all he calls a muddy garden tool a \"dirty hoe.\"Yes, all of this is in a kid's movie, and it's not okay. How did this only get a PG rating from the MPAA?Dr. Suess's wife did us a favor as a result of her appalled reaction. Because of this movie, no other Dr. Suess book can ever become live action.If you have kids who like Dr. Suess, whether a her or a him, I HIGHLY advise that you skip this film. The film is a waste, it's not worth your time. The fact that it even exists is a borderline crime.I understand Shrek has adult jokes, I'm not faulting that at all. But in a little kids movie, I can't say that's the right call. I beg of you, dear reader, never see or show The Cat In The Hat. And that, quite frankly, is all I have to say about that.Reverse Recommendation: If you want a kids movie based on Dr. Suess's work that's more suitable for you, then may I suggest the 2018 Grinch or Horton Hears A Who!",

They try to have kid appeal with non threatening plot and humor while trying to sneak in enough for adults to keep their attention while being dragged to the multiplex. Some of that type of humor is really clever and not so offensive that sharper kids who spot them won't be offended.There is, however, a difference between smart humor and downright crude, vile humor. \"The Cat in the Hat\" falls in the latter category. This film is the most vicious sick form of kid's entertainment I've seen in years. I would have not watched if it weren't for the fact that it was playing at kid's pizza place that I was attending with a child at the time.There are a number of scenes where the children just stare at the cat pulling off one crude gag after another. Bodily function humor abound, I'd have the same reaction. Then there are SO many other scenes that have coarse adult humor. No, it isn't sly innuendo, it's sick. The sad part is, it's not even funny. I watch a slew of animated films and if it's smart adult humor that goes over the head of the little ones, that's fine. But this is sick.The plot is similar to the book. Seuss's words in the book are magical. The plot and message are simple. The kids fall prey to mischief - how do they clean up before mom gets home. How that gets screwed up is beyond me, but this film does it. Innocent mischief, this isn't.While we're on the subject of inappropriate adult humor, let me point out that this film FEATURES PRODUCT PLACEMENT FOR AN ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE. Sickened yet?

SEUSS MOVIE, DIRTY JOKES HAVE NO PLACE IN THIS!!! I also felt Mike Myers was severely miscast as the Cat in the Hat. What is the deal with that accent. It sounds like a cross between a Yiddish accent and the lion from The Wizard of Oz. That laugh got really annoying after a while too. I really hated the cat costume. It looks like he he got stuck with only two facial expressions and when Myers moves he looks stiff. Do not get me started on the gratuitous scenes such as the cat in dress after getting hit in the balls with a bat or the party booth with Paris Hilton. To say that most of the special effects suck would be an understatement. The one thing that makes it really terrible though is even if you had never heard of the Cat in the Hat or Dr. Seuss and just watched this, you would still say its a terrible movie.

She tells the children not to make a mess because she will be entertaining that evening and wants every room looking spic and span.In the mother's absence comes a strange visitor, a cat with a funny hat who tempts the children to do all the naughtiest things imaginable. Did you know that a sprung lounge makes a wonderful springboard for hurtling into space? Did you know that if a cat forbids you to open a big wooden box with a gigantic lock you should not under any circumstances attempt to pick the lock with a knife? Of course the knowledgeable cat knew that the boy would open it, and when he did so, the whole house shook and collapsed in one unholy mess. Added to this their pet dog went missing and that was another adventure perhaps best forgotten.The children were terrified about the condition of the house and pleaded with the cat to help them clean up the mess, an almost impossible task with everything either stained or broken and the stairs completely collapsed. And they knew full well mother was already on her way home.In a world of fantasy anything can happen and in this film everything does. The children are quite well cast and the cheeky cat (Mike Myers) who dominates the action does a highly spirited job. The baby sitter knocked unconscious through most of the action is a big fat woman whom they use as a weight to hold down the lid of the devilish box. I won't divulge what mother saw when she entered through the front door. She was completely astonished , as you would be too knowing what mischief children can get up to.",

That was mainly because I was just a stupid kid who was excited to finally see one of my childhood icons on the big screen. Years passed and now when I look back at this movie. I am ashamed. I can see why Audrey Giesel hated this film, God rest her soul.I will say, some parts of it make me chuckle. I laugh a bit at the Kitchen scene, when The Cat says: \"Magical Time Travelling Elves.\" I giggle, also when the Cat says: \"It was ruined when she brought it.\"But that's only a tiny bit of funny. The rest of the film is just torture. What made Bo Welch think that a kids book needs adult content and potty humor?? There are several times where the Cat nearly says profanity, which was not in the book. He literally moons the children, similar to what Jim Carrey did in the Grinch. And he is the worst role model ever!! He literally offers for the kids to play tennis and wreck the house more after they already destroyed it!!!Here's something that is just the worst. A kid hits the Cat with a bat, and that's a joke most kids won't get. But adults will think, why would a Cat have private parts in that area? He's a freakin cat!!! Unless he's not which is more terrifying!!Of course, the movie tries to lure you in with the rhyming and everything, but I am just never going to watch this film again.

Dr Seuss holds an affectionate place in the heart of many American families.So when the slight book was adapted to a film, it would obviously needed to be expanded and we enter a Tim Burtonesque world of mayhem as two bored kids encounter Mike Myers, Cat in the Hat.Critics were appalled with this film, so was the estate of Dr Seuss. However it was obvious the film had to be stretched out by introducing Alec Baldwin as the oily stepfather to be wanting to ship the kids off.Mike Myers infuses some jokes which will go above the heads of children but adults would catch, no different to modern Disney cartoons.In fact my kids found the film zany and fun and although not perfect it is entertaining.",

            "content": "In this era for which children's entertainment has been reduced almost entirely to brain-dead cartoons, almost any attempt to include real, flesh and blood children in a live action feature should be greeted with the sincerest of praise.  Against an avalanche, an ocean of assembly-line animated rubbish that makes dumber seem smarter, the room for humans in films made for children has all but been lost.  Therefore, when one comes along, it is painful not to be able to give it some praise.  This film has two delightful children--real ones, not just voices for cartoons, and it even offers a reasonably intelligent message.  Look closely: The cat teaches them that too much chaos is no more fun than too much order!Indeed, for the most part, one gets the sense that the production started out with the best of intentions, but then something started going wrong, and what was meant as a film for children became an embarrassing farce.  Was it Mike Myers, painfully miscast as the Cat, but looking more like a fat old man wearing a silly costume?  Or his dirty jokes and puns, obvious to any adult, but crass and inappropriate for a film aimed at children?  In one case, the dirty old man in a costume theme is made obvious by having his all too human backside exposed, crack and all, while farting away like some cheap gag in a burlesque routine.  Badah-boom, badah-bing!  How original! When his lines and style are not stolen outright from the Cowardly Lion of the 1939 Wizard of OZ, they are dredged up from his own former Austin Powers character.What is \"right\" about this film is the employment of human children in a live action adventure.  What is \"wrong\" with it, however, is Mike Myers with his potty mouth, confusing the Cat with Austin Powers.  He was funny as Austin Powers, but that character is out of place in a children's story.  As a result, it serves neither the adult audience nor the children.  And worse, it sends the message that live action stores with real kids involved is a bad idea, when that's the one part of the film that is good.  It is \"more\" of them that are needed, not less, but when something this bad comes along, it makes the cartoon garbage seem superior by comparison.",

            "content": "Well, it sure *looks* like Dr. Seuss's ...CAT...:  production designer-turned-director Bo Welch & Co. got the style of the late Theodore Geisel's illustrations exactly right in the art direction, costume design, and F/X makeup.  Alas, the script feels more like the work of cynical sketch comedy writers than Dr. Seuss' playful, good-natured anarchy.  Indeed, the Cat himself seems to be rebelling against his creator, dropping the rhyme scheme from his speech within minutes of his introduction by admitting something along the lines of being \"not so good at this rhyming thing...\" Mind you, I didn't find it *entirely* unwatchable: it helped that I found child actors Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin (beloved in our household for his voice work as \"Captain Crandall\" in the animated TV series TEAMO SUPREMO) to be funny and engaging, and I enjoyed Mike Myers' Bert Lahr-esque delivery in the title role (though they've also turned him into a master of disguise, the best of which is his Rasta hippie bit).  Although there's a reasonable amount of laughs, cool props and set pieces, this ...CAT... still feels unnecessarily plot-heavy even with its 78-minute running time (there's a portal into a sort of purple-goo-coated dimension...and the kids have to learn to work with and not against each other...and mom Kelly Preston is up against both her scheming suitor Alec Baldwin and her Boss From Hell Sean Hayes, who also doubles as The Goldfish's voice.  And you thought LORD OF THE RINGS was chock-full of plotting! :-). The real problem, however, is that ...CAT... lacks the sense of cheerful spontaneity that made the book and the rest of Dr. Seuss' work so endearing.  All too often, the movie is obnoxious when it should be puckish.  Well, at least Smash Mouth contributed a couple of catchy songs, including a nifty cover of The Beatles' \"Getting Better.\"  Besides, our 7-year-old daughter loved the flick, and after all, she's the target audience. But hey, LOONEY TUNES: BACK IN ACTION charmed and entertained everybody in our little family, so why couldn't ...CAT... accomplish that as well?  Anyway, after ...CAT... and ...GRINCH..., I can't help wondering what could be next in producer Brian Grazer's apparently relentless quest to turn Dr. Seuss' loopy whimsy into loud, garish movies. What the heck, how about a remake of THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T starring that Oscar-winning PIANIST Adrien Brody as the megalomaniac piano teacher? :-)",

Whilst this film is remarkably colourful, costume design is good and it has the look of a Dr Seuss creation - it is quite possibly the only thing that Dr Seuss intended!The crux of whether this film was going to be good or not was whether Mike Myers could successfully pull off the role of the Cat.  Unfortunately, he doesn't.  I'd be suprised if there were not some kids scared by the look of the cat.  Furthermore, Mike Myers appears to be playing Dr Evil from Austin Powers dressed in a cat costume and he falls flat.However, this is not even the main fault - it's the humour.  For the most part, it is too childish to appeal to adults and at times, the innuendo may go a bit too far to be funny to children.  The only part of the movie that made me genuinely laugh was the infommercial parody.The other problem I had with the film was the supporting characters - I didn't find either of the kids or the parts played by Sean Hayes and Alec Baldwin particularly funny or likeable.  The shining light was Kelly Preston - who is reasonably good.  The narration is also a nice touch.Overall, its hard to say whether the mish-mash of styles and hunour will actually keep anyone entertained for the length of the film.

I seen a few more trailers and to be honest the movie still looked bizarre but I caught myself laughing at the trailers. So tonight, two of my brothers and I journeyed to see the Cat in the Hat at the local theater.I went to the theater tonight not knowing what to expect. The film started and by the time Mike Myers came into the movie I was hooked. This film was so weird. My eyes were glued to the screen the entire time. I laughed several times in the film and the movie itself was a visual fest for the eyes. It's hard to describe the movie but it's like Austin Powers, A big talking cat, a little Tim Burton, and some great background art all mixed up in a blender and you get the Cat in the Hat. The problem in which I notice with the movie is that its not like the book as far as I can recall. I loved the book when I was younger but it wasn't like the movie. I didn't mind that though. You can't transfer over a book that you can read in 5 minutes into a movie. They took the concept of the book and expanded it. That's the best way I can explain the movie and also this film is very unique. Trust me when I say this you will not see another movie like this one.\nThe acting in the film for what type of movie it was is good. I enjoyed Mike Myers as the Cat, I have to admit before hand that I really like Mike Myers and I always seem to find him amusing. Dakota Fanning who played Sally in the film, for once did not annoy me. I remember watching her in Uptown Girls over the summer and I hated her performance but in the film she fitted in nicely. Spencer Breslin was also good in the film. The worst performance of the film and the character I feel I could have really done without in the movie is Alec Baldwin. His role was pointless, unfunny, and stupid. Alec Baldwin hasn't had a career in sometime and this idiotic role won't get his career back on track anytime soon. His role was one of the few things I disliked about the movieThe movie as I said above is a visual fest for the eyes. The director and the art designers on this movie do a terrific job. I love the camera angles and all the cartoon backdrops and the fiction like town. The movie didn't have much of a story but its one of those movies where you just watch to enjoy and laugh. It's a fun film for many people. There were some jokes for the kids and a lot of adult jokes mixed into the mix as well. It was an enjoyable movie.So in conclusion, I really liked the film. It put me in a good mood and I for one was not in a good mood when I went to see this film. I laughed quite a bit and I was amazed of how cool the visuals in the film were. I know the critics hated this but it's not a film, which is going to be hailed by critics. If you want a good meaningful movie visit the Independent Theater but if you want a fun, silly, and above all weird movie then go see Cat in the Hat. I would give this film a very strong 8/10 and I will go see it again because I enjoyed it that much.",

And they straight up butchered our childhood's. It is disgustingly revolting. The sheer thought of THIS as an adaptation of a KIDS book that we all read and grew up with, just makes me sick to my stomach. Also, I would like to go punch the MPAA in the face for not making this a PG-13 film of an adaption of a kids book for crying out loud. Let me give you a few reasons why this movie is my least favorite movie of all time. 10. This should have been an animated movie. I would have liked it a heck more if this was animated. At least then I could give it some credibility. 9. What gave them the idea to make this an actual movie. Look, I don't care if Hollywood adapts more books into movies as long as they represent the source material. 8. IT does not represent the source material and doesn't understand why the material was great to begin with. 7. The casting of Mike Myers as the cat. I love Mike Myers but he just doesn't seem like the type to play this sort of character. I would have preferred Robert Downey, Jr. 6. The pop cultural references which I hate with a passion. 5. The acting. Breslin and Dakota are just so bland and boring. Steven Hawking's voice- box emotes more emotion than these two do. 4. The director, Bo Welsh, is a production designer and better than a director I must say. 3. Rated PG?! That is the dumbest decision the MPAA has made since giving Roger Rabbit the same rating, which totally deserved the same rating. Seriously, the boy almost said the s-word!!!! 2. If Dr. Seuss was alive, he would rage all over the execs. At universal. 1. The fact that this actually exists!!! Worst movie ever made. Worse than batman and robin by just a tiny little bit. 1/10",

Then the movie comes along and ruins it.Just as the Grinch was better served by Chuck Jones than Ron Howard, so the DePatie-Freleng adaptations of the good doctor's stories for television are far better than this bloated exercise; the movie marks the feature directing debut of production designer Bo Welch, and appropriately enough the movie looks great, with its storybook design and bright pastel colours. But it just doesn't have any proper script - sorry Alec Berg, David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer [all of whom, shockingly, used to write for \"Seinfeld\" - which is like James L. Brooks turning his back on a brilliant TV career to write and direct a Steven Seagal movie] -  instead chucking in a load of unclever and far too crude humour performed at very high volume by Mike Myers, who's all energy and no charm; he comes across more like the Mask than as the Cat in the Hat, except that the Mask had the saving grace of actually being funny.Plus, like it or not, the man does not have a self-effacing bone in his body; the inability to let others share the screen and the belief in his own comic genius that made Austin Powers unbearable after the first movie both get in the way here. Kelly Preston is nondescript as the mother of the two kids (Spencer Breslin and the female Haley Joel Osment, Dakota Fanning) around whom the plot revolves, leaving Sean Hayes and Alec Baldwin squeeze in to add some genuinely amusing moments, but it's too busy being a ruthless exercise in pandering to the audience to be effective, and like its title character it never knows when enough is enough. It's busy, and it's loud, and it throws in everything from musical numbers to tongue-in-cheek product placement and self-reverence (like the Cat joking about throwing in a song for the soundtrack album), but it's dull and ultimately hollow and synthetic; something like \"Animaniacs\" has the tone this movie wants, but in addition to being much funnier each cartoon has the advantage of only being about half an hour instead of close to 90 minutes (though this movie's relative shortness is among its few real virtues). The fact that Paris \"What do you mean this shows off too much skin?\" Hilton has a cameo in what's supposed to be a family movie pretty much sums it up; \"Pure unadulterated fun without much sense or judgement,\" the Cat in the Hat says at one point.

I will say this for the movie: whenever Mike Myers broke from the structure of the film and his character to just be Mike Myers, he was kind of funny. As in a chuckle here, a snicker there.And that's it with my praise with this film.There is not an actor on screen in this film who is interesting to watch, fun to watch, or tolerable to watch. From Mike Myers to Dakota Fanning and everyone in between, the cast in this movie had no idea what they were doing.Even the visuals were bad. I don't just mean that they were poorly done; they physically hurt my eyes to look at them. There's so much brightness without any contrast. There's no rhyme or reason to the way the art direction was done. It was just all a bunch of bright pinks and bright oranges.There's also a CGI fish in this movie. He looks awful. I don't know who the designer for that fish was, but I think it was his goal to scare the children. Of course, the exact same could be said for the designer for the Cat costume. They look genuinely frightening. I'm sitting there watching the costumes in this movie--and not just the Cat, but even the kids'--wondering what drugs the designers were on to make them. They looked ridiculously bad. Not purposefully stupid, or corny in a good way, but a next level of terrible costuming that would give the costume designers for Battlefield Earth a run for their money. And then there's the script. I'm sorry, was this honestly meant for kids? There's problem number one. This movie is dumbed down to be aimed at children, but there's so much doo-doo in the script to make me think they wanted to cater more to adults. In the film, the Cat actually spells out the word \"sh*t.\" They never say it, but any child who can spell--so any child over the age of six--can easily figure this out. Then there're the racist jokes. And the sexism. And the innuendos. A lot that is directed at the kids' Asian babysitter.This movie is deplorable. A hopelessly garish \"comedy\" aimed at children (adults?).

Most found its vulgarity and juvenile sense of humor to be offensive, considering the magical and timeless source material. There's no doubt that Mike Myers' Austin Powers brand of humor is an ill fit for the classic Dr. Seuss story, but if you can power through the shock value inherent in The Cat In The Hat, you'll find a fairly entertaining kids romp with a couple of genuine laughs for adults.The Cat In The Hat shares the same basic outline from the book, with two kids, Sally and Conrad, having a chance encounter with a life-sized Cat played by Mike Myers. The crux of the story is that general hilarity ensues and the kids must clean up before their mother comes home. It's a great story to tell in a children's picture book; There it is charming, innocent, and whimsical. Here, the hilarity is a strange mix of Mike Myers brand humor and standard kid's potty jokes. The kid stuff is dreadfully unfunny, but I can't say that Mike Myers doesn't infuse some kind of welcome energy to the proceedings.I may sound like I'm giving this film a glowing review; I'm not. The Cat In The Hat spends much more time with flat gags, needless plot points, and baffling music numbers than it does with the moments of real comedy. The story here meanders through every kind of clich\u00e9 kiddy movie plot point you can think of, and Mike Myers tries his best to annoy even the most optimistic viewers to tears (He relentlessly shouts \"Oh Yeah\" like an off-brand Kool-Aid Man... Guess what? That catchphrase ain't sticking).I'm not here to sing the praises of The Cat In The Hat. I'm not even going to defend it, but call me crazy, I laughed during this movie. I really laughed, at more than a few points in the film. Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin are cute, and the sets are colorful and inventive. This movie has problems for sure, mainly stemming from the fact that the whimsy of the book has been replaced with mean-spirited, gross-out humor.

It thinks it's being clever by inserting innuendos but it just comes across as desperate.

I was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what S H * T spells.  Essentially what happens here is a total twisting of Dr. Seuss's classic.  It adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money. If that was a subplot, then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and \"the cat\" plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is.

In fact, i feel kind of sorry for everybody involved in this movie. Mike Myers only had one other large live-action role after this, Alec Baldwin mostly works in animation nowadays, Dakota Fanning wouldn't be in a unanimously well received movie till a couple of years later, but the most affected victim was Bo Welch, the movie's director. Guess how many movies he's made? One. This one. So while it isn't a good movie, or even really a passable one...i can't really get too mad at it. I do like SOME of the humor, emphasis on SOME. Some lines do land, but those that don't are sadly far more noticeable. The story is garbage (some 4th graders fanfiction is probably better than this) but the visuals are nice....sometimes. Other times they look like a rejected theme park attraction. The music is...alright. Smash Mouth is a little jarring, considering another film that came out only a couple of years before also used Smash Mouth...i don't get it...

That's selfish.The kids were a little bit more bearable, but I still didn't really enjoy much about them.

            "content": "The overly negative reviews of this movie \"The Cat in the Hat\" at IMDb are understandable (I guess a lot of people took their kindergartners to see this), but honestly, I enjoyed its innovation for some reason. I know that it deviates a lot from the Dr. Seuss book, but aside, I found its off-color humor to be effective quite often on its own.Everything goes well in Dr. Seuss style until the Cat (a barely recognizable Mike Myers under lots of heavy makeup) walks in. Scatological jokes soon fly around, and the Cat ridiculously claims that he's bad at rhyming (a poke at Dr. Seuss, I guess). In fact, during the movie the Cat even says things such as \"Son of a b****\" (last word bleeped out) and \"Dirty ho\" to a garden hoe, soon after which he suavely says \"I'm sorry, babe, I love you\" and pretends to french-kiss it. He scratches his bare butt in front of the kids, gets hit in the nuts with a baseball bat (my favorite moment from the movie), makes the kids 'ride' their babysitter through a roller-coaster in his fantasy world, and explicitly talks to the kids about murdering a dog.Even when the Cat isn't doing anything obscene, it's just the way he talks (often with a Scottish accent) that suggests of something risqu\u00e9. If this is the kind of stuff one doesn't want their kids to see, then stay away from this movie, simple as that.In terms of acting, Mike Myers is doing his routine off-color comedy that looks mostly improvised, while the kids (Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning), their Mom (Kelly Preston), and their mom's perverted boyfriend (Alec Baldwin) do a decent job in their roles. The design and sets are appropriately bright, vivid and dream-like.Despite it's PG rating, I may add that this movie is best left to the teenage and up crowd, because young kids simply won't find the innocence of the Dr. Seuss book here. But if you'd like to see how a true kids' rhyme can be pervertedly fleshed out by by Hollywood into a 90-minute, multi-million dollar spectacle, and enjoy the bizarre results, then you might find The Cat in the Hat's humor interesting in at least some parts.

            "content": "Words cannot possibly express or comprehend how horrendous and downright foul this movie is...but I'll give it a shot anyway.The Cat in the Hat is one of the most beloved children's books of all times. A mischievous cat enters in on two bored children, causes some mischief but then cleans it all of and goes off into the horizon. A true classic. Which then begs the question how on earth someone with $165 million to spend could possibly look at the source material and produce this abomination.Why do I hate it so much? Well there's the fact that the characters are incredibly hateful. From the mother's hateful boss, the mother herself, the bratty brat played by Abigail Breslin's less talented sibling, Alec Baldwin's completely unnecessary character, the racist stereotype babysitter (I'll get to her) and of course, the cat himself.My congratulations to Mike Myers and the script writers, it takes a lot of effort to remove all charm and joy from Dr. Seuss's most beloved character but by god, they succeeded! Especially when they quickly say he doesn't do rhyming because the writers clearly stopped caring later on. Myers doesn't really play the Cat in the Hat as much as go through his shtick that in hindsight, should have warned us about the dated and repetitious Goldmember movie. And let's talk about the jokes. They're horrendous, hateful and shockingly crude. From the Cat ogling a picture of the mother and opening like a playboy centerfold, the grotesque racial stereotype -- Mrs. Kwan and outright physical abuse they put her through (line from the move -- \"we're riding Mrs. Kwan\"), and the swearing. Now I'm all for free use of our vocabulary but seeing the Cat drop the f-bomb and s*** is very disheartening. Not to mention all the penis jokes, butt jokes, cross-dressing, death threats, and the worst attempt at fourth wall humor to justify blatant product placement. And speaking of blatant pandering, Paris Hilton has a cameo and Myers dances with her -- WHY ON EARTH IS Paris HILTON IN A DR. SEUSS MOVIE!? I could go into the bad plot, forced dilemmas and inconsistent faithfulness and use of Dr. Seuss's work and prose but the above pretty much established there was no hope for something like plot to save this travesty.I hate this film, I really, really, really hate this film. I haven't worked out an order for my most hated films but this is in the top three. No wonder Dr. Seuss's widow was so disgusted with this film that she did the world a favor by pulling the plug on future live-action adaptations of Dr. Seuss. And given that she's had the Lorax shill for Mazda, that's really saying something.OVERALL: To borrow/steal a line from the late great Roger Ebert describing \"Battle: Los Angeles\", \"If your friend likes this, they're idiots, if your date likes it, you need to tell them that it's time to consider seeing other people, and if someone tries to show it to your young children, have them barred from ever being around a minor.\"",

So when my mom rented it, I thought I would check it out, and hey, it was free for me!\"The Cat in the Hat's\" style of humor is very odd to say the least.  The screenplay is written by writers from \"Seinfeld,\" the \"Clerks\" animated series, and \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" - all shows that I love - but these writers just didn't make the proper transition to the family genre. I can only think of two moments that I thought were genuinely funny - the \"magical\" lawyers and the melodramatic music The Cat plays on the organ. It just seems like they tried to make a family-friendly \"Saturday Night Live,\" and it just failed miserably.  I think they had a problem determining whom this movie was for.  It can be too vulgar for the family set, and it's just too unfunny for the grown-up set.I also question how the cast members approached this movie.  If you check out the outtakes on the DVD, there are quite a few instances of curse words that are bleeped out.  Now, I admit I'm partial to Disney, and I'm sure there's swearing that goes on in their movies, but they don't document it! I'm also somewhat troubled when Alec Baldwin swore every time he screwed up a line, even in front of child actor Spencer Breslin.  I'm sure Spencer has heard those words before; but c'mon, Alec, hold your tongue!!The characters were also extremely annoying.  One of the most annoying things a person can do is laugh at their own jokes, and that's exactly what The Cat did, ALL THE TIME!  It drove me nuts!!!  As for Thing 1 & Thing 2, they just seemed demonic and possessed as they scrambled around everywhere, speaking an unintelligible language.  They reminded me of the \"Teletubbies.\" (There's just something about a baby's face in a sun that just freaks me out!)  Alec Baldwin's villain was also super-annoying.  Why was he so bent on sending Conrad to military school, and how could Kelly Preston's character ever fall for him?As you can see, there are just so many things to criticize \"The Cat in the Hat\" about (oh, and I can't forget the Paris Hilton cameo!)  However, I will say that the visuals were pretty good, and they stick in your head for a while.  Also, Dakota Fanning is a fine, little actress, even though she seems to be getting typecast as the uptight kid, because her acting abilities are up there with veteran actors.  Other than that, \"The Cat in the Hat\" is just a disturbing picture that is a slap in the face of the great Dr. Seuss.My IMDb Rating: 3/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: D (Dreadful)",

The film makers didn't learn from Grinch which only worked when it dealt with material from the book, unfortunately in the case of the Cat that material is all over the place, the film is mostly new material so it just doesn't work.The film also suffers from the biggest problem with adapting Seuss- his stuff never looks right off the printed page.

It will make the experience much funnier.Of course, the people who expected a heartwarming classic for kids of all ages were bound to be disappointed. This is a movie from the folks who went on to write \"Eurotrip\". That should tell you more than enough about what to expect.

That mixes the nostalgia factor with the slew of adult oriented jokes (like infomercials) and the unnecessary addition of mother being single and dating. Kids aren't going to find humor in those situations.The material that is closer to the original book is much more charming and I imagine that kids will relate to it more as the kids are much more involved, or even the focus of the scenes.The Cat in the Hat, even though he is the title character, is a support character to the two kids, played by Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin, who both do all they can with the writing to balance out Mike Myers as the Cat. I don't feel like Mike Myers understands the idea of being a supporting character: he gives me a very Tom Cruise / Jimmy Fallon vibe where if there was a pause, then would just center himself in the camera and do something to draw attention. \"Oh yeah!\" is a good example for this movie, a repeated, unnecessary line that doesn't once help the scene let alone the movie.One would think after Jim Carey's \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" (2000) there would be a formula for how to adapt Dr. Seuss books (20 pages) to full length feature films, and someone clearly figured it out later in \"The Lorax\" (2012) and \"The Grinch\" (2018), so I'm....gonna blame Mike Myers.Him aside, the movie has a lot of charm to it, and Alec Baldwin manages to work an unnecessary part to at least be a believable antagonist, though the best acting in the world can't make a bad part good.If you're just really into Dr. Seuss, then give it a watch, but you're not going to miss anything special if you skip it.",

The Cat In The Hat will, thankfully, survive this ridiculous excuse for a movie.  While the Cat In The Hat himself will live on as a timeless children's favorite this movie will hopefully be quickly forgotten and have the DVD copies put into a trash compactor.What they did to The Cat In The Hat is unforgivable.  Adult themes.  Blatant commercialism, including a shameless plug for Universal Studios (I wonder how much that set them back) and the pop music they put on the soundtrack for the movie.  The jokes might have been funny if this movie wasn't supposed to be based upon the Cat In The Hat.  Mike Meyers performance might have been considered brilliant if this wasn't supposed to be a movie about one of the most beloved child characters ever.  But we can't say that because this movie was a travesty.The twisting of the Cat in The Hat to a perverted, ill humored, chaos weaving creature that appeared to be ready to take a baseball bat to a small child, is unbelievable.  The Cat making jokes about whores, and nearly giving a tongue bath to a garden hoe in the same 2-second bit?  What were they thinking?  Obviously they didn't think about much.The movie would probably terrify most small children, whom you would have expected this movie to be targeted towards.  This is not a movie to take the kids to or to show them on video/DVD.  This movie should be shown in every film school in the world as a shining example of how to not make a child's storybook into a movie.  I could say more but I'll give myself and ulcer and I'll need some Tums.All I can say is this movie was pitiful.  I'd rather watch Leonard Part 6 again instead of this garbage.",

My sister works at the theater and she said people walked out half way through the movie and wanted refunds, of course they got free movie passes, and they went and saw something else like \"Brother Bear\" or \"Elf\".After I saw this I got my refund and saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre instead, and believe it or not I would gladly give that movie awards after seeing CRAP in the hat!Please, please, please don't waste you're money, and have a good time at another film.",

            "content": "The title given to the movie couldn't be further from the truth, this shambles of a movie is far from Dr Seuss' original tale of the Cat in the Hat, his most beloved character. This is carnival of garbage and attempts at destroying everything good with the original story. To use the phrase, Dr Seuss turned in his grave isn't strong enough. From the awful acting to the dreadful story and script, the viewer is left shocked and disgusted. We are introduced to Conrad and Sally, brother and sister, plank and plank. From the moment we meet them, it is like watching two talking rocks. No emotion is given to the performance at all, but who could really blame them? The dialogue is shockingly bad, and the character deter to much from the original story. Remember how in the original, they were just two bored kids? Well, this is Hollywood, so they aren't just two bored kids, one is a control freak and the other is just you average, reckless, house-destroying, little brat of a boy. To be fair, I can see where the writers are coming from because movies are ripped apart and scolded for including bland character so often these days, but maybe that's one of the reasons \"The Cat in the Hat\" just isn't meant to be made into a feature length movie.So now we have our family, I didn't mention the mother but she's there, and hosting a party for which the house must be neat and tidy or else, we are told in one of the most silly and over-acted ways, she's \"fired!\". Coincidence of coincidences, the movie begins to use some source material as it begins to rain, meaning Monk and Destructron can't play outside. Now if you're familiar with the original story, by this point you'll either have left (actually, that could be said for even those who haven't read it), cried or expect to see our titular character, the Cat in the Hat very soon. So when the children hear that \"Bump\", we know that the horrific and nightmare-inducing moment is fast approaching. We are now introduced the Cat, Mike Myers in a big cat costume, and it is absolutely the metaphor of pure terror. He looks so little like a cat and to make matters worse, that isn't the worst thing about the Cat. No, this is a Dr Seuss character who claims that he isn't good at \"rhyming\", laughs like a witch and to be honest has no idea what fun is, even though he is meant to be the advocate of it. Along with this, he isn't funny, which is what the studio was going for unfortunately. Not childish jokes either, they riddle the movie with adult humour which as I will say again, isn't Dr Seuss. The original had a child-like charm to it, that when read by grown ups didn't seem dated, instead it reminded them of their youthful days, and the message was pretty clear, \"it's fun to have fun but you've got to know how\", sickeningly enough this quote is used in the film but it just can't stick to this one message like the book did. The message is so skewed that we are unsure what it was trying to tell us, in other words, there was a message, there were hundreds of attempted messages, but none of them really touch or get to the viewer. There are so many messages crammed into the movie that it's a mess, when instead it should have kept to one. Take for example the relationship between Conrad and his mother, we are told through the obvious dialogue, but not the acting, that they don't see eye-to-eye and the mother is considering military school, an option put forward by her boyfriend Alec Baldwin, yes, boyfriend, in a Seuss movie. This idea of a family breakdown could be done well, it is an emotional and thought-provoking idea but in the wrong movie. The idea is used so lightly and done so badly, then when mixed with the million other things the movie wants to say and the crude humour, we fail to see the emotional side that should be seen. The idea of \"fun\" isn't done well either as \"fun\" is taken to new and dangerous extremes, showing that not even the cat knows how to have fun. There is so much more that is wrong with this film such as the diabolical story but when these other points are made, I think that's enough proof to stay well clear.",

            "content": "Who dares call this piece of crud Dr. Seuss related? This whole thing has nothing to do with Dr. Seuss! It was like whoever wrote it took the book, flushed it down the toilet, and resurrected it as crud!So the kids, Conrad and Sally, are each a rule breaker and a control freak. Uh, isn't the Cat in the Hat enough of a rule breaker already? And the Cat is nothing like the original Dr. Seuss version. Sure he comes up with games and wrecks the house in the process, but he adds sexual innuendos, obnoxiously constant 4th wall jokes, and looks more like a man dressed in a heavy Cat Halloween costume. I don't blame the make up artist necessarily, but I bet Jim Carrey would do better in that costume than Mike Myers did. And that's another thing that bugs me; it's Mike Myers, not the Cat. Everybody knows it's Myers under that cat suit. (maybe that's a bit picky) Oh and the one line he gives that automatically spits in Dr. Seuss' face is: \"Why I'm the Cat in the Hat; there's no doubt about that! I'm a super fun differs feline, who's here to make sure that you're..........meline?.........keline?.........terpentine? I got nothing; I'm not so good with the rhyming, not really.\" Let that sink in. The only thing to rival the Cat's obnoxiousness are......the Things. Yeah, in the book they're so adorable, fun loving, and do the kind of fun I'd want to do! Here in the movie, they're creepy looking (what's up with the Marge Simpson hair?), super annoying, and why does Thing 2 have to clarify with the 4th wall that his name doesn't downsize him or that just because he's Thing 2 that it doesn't mean he's second best? Nobody needed to know that! In fact almost all the 4th wall jokes were so obnoxious that it took away from the story. The rest of the characters: Oh I hated them! The mother was okay, the kids were bland, the boss was an idiot, the babysitter (who mixed Mrs. Doubtfire with too much makeup and made her such an offensive stereotype?), the villain: Oh he's the worst! I think the writers deliberately tried to make him look like a jerk in every way possible, so they threw in him being nice to the mother, but behind her back be cruel (if you can call it that) to the kids, and being attractive on the outside but inside he's disgusting. The story didn't need a villain; the book by itself had no need for antagonists (unless the Cat is considered one, I don't know) but that was what was nice about the story. It was a simple at home story where the Cat comes and wrecks the place in wild ways that our parents would never have approved of. He didn't need a contract to give out forbidden fun or clean up afterwards; it almost felt as if the writers didn't know what to write so they just took from the garbage can whatever they could find and throw it at the story.Another thing I found shameful was all the innuendoes, filthy humor, inserting swearing (in a KID'S film) and terrible jokes. None of them have to do with Dr. Seuss. For example, the Cat lusts over Conrad's mother when looking at her photo (Dr. Seuss?), him mooning at the camera, (Dr. Seuss?) he yells, \"Dirty hoe!\" while holding one (Dr. Seuss?), getting smashed in the most painful place (Dr. Seuss??), and I can't believe this one: the S.L.O.W. or Super Hydraulic Institanious Transmitter (DR. SEUSS??????) I could just punch the screenwriters for deliberately inserting dirty humor and swearing in a kid's film! This doesn't shape their childhood, rather it rapes their childhood - how can they not see that?! Though I will give this movie credit: the sets still look like Dr. Seuss land if nothing else and are more enjoyable than anything else in the film, and the only character I shamefully enjoy is the fish. I say shamefully, because I'm suppose to enjoy the Cat and the kids but because they have no character development or anything valuable to watch, the fish is more enjoyable. He tries to convince the kids (in almost the same way in the book) that the Cat needs to leave, also the surrounding jokes (even from Myers) are hilarious. Tragically there's nothing else to enjoy or be proud of.The Grinch may not have been the best Dr. Seuss film, but you know what? I'd rather see the Grinch than this flick in the face! At least Jim Carrey had more energy and better character acting than Mike Myers as the Cat. Stick to Shrek, Myers.",

But I have to say all it succeded in doing was annoying me intensely. Who was the film aimed at? Was it aimed at anyone? Will anyone find it entertaining?All in all this was a mess of a film that should have been done by someone else, or left well enough alone altogether. I believe it got a Razzie award as \"The Worst Excuse for an Actual Film\". I suppose I should give a nod to the effort, since in this day and age all Hollywood ever seems to do is remake old films. But try as I might, I can't get enthusiastic about this movie. It's Completely Rubbish And Peurile, to give it the same treatment as the Cat's car.Avoid this one if you have fond memories of Dr Seuss' works. In fact, just avoid it.

            "content": "To this day, I am still frightened of Mike Meyers in The Cat in the Hat, an adaption that had Dr Seuss spinning in his grave from the opening credits. If you read my Grinch review, you'll see an overview for this planned Seuss live action cinematic universe and my main problems with it. Undeterred by the largely negative reception to its Iron Man, Universal Pictures saw the dollar signs and locked onto the next children's picture book that they could ruin. The movie may begin with with a tribute to the storybook aesthetic of its roots, curly font and all, and may be officially titled as Dr Seuss' The Cat in the Hat, but it most certainly takes the name of its creator in vain. In lieu of the original's simple charm and short and sweet life lesson, the movie is a 82 minute (bloated and feeling longer than that) mishmash of crude skits, and inconsequential diversions. The tonal disaster can be summed up in a series of questions directed towards the creative team behind it:Why does it seem that everything in this movie's aesthetic and visual style is designed to make me upchuck? Why did the makeup artists not learn from the creepy dog-human mutations of the Whos, rendering the Things equally as creepy? Why does the Cat's hat spring up after seeing a picture of Joan (this part seems to be cut out of the Netflix version, which indicates some common sense but also the unstoppable nature of this trainwreck)? Why does he take on the persona of a redneck mechanic who isn't shy about showing off his behind? Why is he so scared of litigation, and why is there an implication that he's already ruined other children's lives when they skimmed the fine print? Why is his laugh so unsettling? Why do the Things play gridiron with Nevins? Why does the Cat continually mock Conrad, get his name wrong, and joke about ditching the pair after each mishap? Why does he keep casually suggesting murder as a viable option? Why is he such a sarcastic jerk? Why is there an underground disco in the middle of Anville? Why does the Cat start breakdancing in the middle of the disco, and why is he making googly eyes at Paris Hilton? Why is the previous acronym for his car a swear word, when this is a PG rated, family-friendly flick? Why does the movie pause to shill Universal Studios, and why is this product placement money unable to be detected in the budget?Admittedly, there are a few chuckle-worthy moments of lampshading (\"We even managed to work in an up-tempo pop tune for the soundtrack. That's important.\"), and I'll always giggle when Easy by The Commodores chimes in as the Cat's private parts get obliterated by Beans. Even I can rhyme better than the titular character from an iconic book written by an author whose main claim to fame were his couplets. That joke might encapsulate the entire catastrophe's most cardinal sin: that it completely and utterly ignores the key appeal of its source material for an adult jokeathon. For every clean, child-friendly gaff, there are ten which break the 4th wall or wink loudly at the adult audience accompanying their children to what they think is a fun family film. A whole panel of executives signed off on this, but obviously none of them had read the book. If they had, they would realise that the Cat shouldn't be gyrating across the screen, licking hoes, or sporting a coconut bra. If you take a glance at the footage that didn't make the cut, you'll get an even clearer picture of the nightmare fuel that traumatised an entire generation, including three different iterations of a scene where the Things cause a flood to slow down Joan (where them blowing up a dam is only the second most disturbing scenario). Predictably, the film has gained a cult following in the age of the Internet, where irony is second nature and sincerity is poison; how could it not, when the same kids who first experienced it are now old enough to actually understand its potty humour? I can't deny them this sort of macabre enjoyment, but let's not be so hasty in its critical and cultural reassessment. Tommy Wiseau's The Room is such a monumental disaster that you just hitch along for the ride, like being mesmerised by a burning house. There's an artistry in the way its creator's megalomania destroys it all from the inside. But this is just sad. A genuine blockbuster effort that misses the point.",

            "content": "My Take: Mike Myers' adult humor doesn't fit with the sweet, child-oriented nature of the material. The success of Ron Howard's big-budget adaptation of Dr. Suess' \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" prompted the release of yet another adaptation of a Theodor Seuss Geisel story, this time one of his finest and most memorable. No one would mention the name of Dr. Suess without first having the image of the Cat in the Hat popping up your mind. And so, it's inevitable that this one will be as much as a success as Howard's big-budget holiday hit of 2000 (or in the words of the Cat himself, \"There's not doubt about that!\").THE CAT IN THE HAT is also produced by Brian Grazer, but instead of bringing back Howard, the new director is former production designer Bo Welch, who still flexes his talents here. As a production designer for many visually stunning works as BATMAN RETURNS, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and MEN IN BLACK, Welch makes sure the sets and atmosphere are as spontaneous as possible and good-looking at the extremes. In that way, he fulfills his job as a visual stylist, but as a director, he's as accomplished as a yes-man. When it comes to asking if adult jokes (Cat saying \"Dirty Ho!\" to a literal hoe, Saying \"Son of a...\" incompletely when he accidentally cuts his tail off, a Paris Hilton cameo, etc.) are appropriate even to momentarily appear in a G-rated adaptation of one of the most beloved children's book figures ever, Welch just says \"Action!\" and let the film roll.CAT IN THE HAT might have been funny if it were a different film. But, as an adaptation of a much beloved literary classic for toddlers and young kids, throwing in a smarmy Paris Hilton cameo is a big mistake. Unfortunately for CAT IN THE HAT, that's just one in a series of big mistakes it commits. Mike Myers is a funny man, but playing Cat as part-Dr. Suess character and part-Austin Powers in a creepy Michael Jackson-like make-up is a bad move. Cat performs a series of carnival sideshow antics that might drive the kids wild, but too much of it may have their parents very worried. Or what about those \"mature-level\" jokes meant for adult appeal? Isn't it a little too early for kids to know that saying \"I'm gonna kill ya.\" as a joke is supposed to be humorous? Other than the wrong portrayal of the main title character, there's also the character of Alec Baldwin, as a simply gross next-door neighbor, who is simply too much of a baddie in a kid-oriented feature. Are you willing enough to show this to your kids if I told you he picks his belly-button? Despite some highlights of the much younger cast member, the charming Dakota Fanning as control-freak, mommy's girl Sally who gets into a much more mature character than any of the immature adult cast members, THE CAT IN THE HAT aims for the right audiences, but doesn't capture them. The movie could have been a lot more fun as Howard's adaptation of THE GRINCH? Despite some of its flaws, it emerged as an endearing piece of Holiday treat. In fact, a little slice of THE GRINCH's flaws would seem welcome in place of CAT IN THE HAT's flaws.Rating: ** out of 5.",

There was 1 redeeming quality and it's sadly the one off characters that weren't in the book and only in this movie. I loved Sean Hayes' performance as the mother's mysophobic boss Hank Humberfloob. I also enjoyed Amy Hill's performance as Miss Kwan the narcoleptic babysitter. Alec Baldwin despite not caring one bit and seemingly only doing this for a easy paycheck, did give a good performance as the piggish and snobby neighbor.However, Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin's performances were wooden and boring with no emotion whatsoever. Aside from the shameless marketing, toilet humor, and tasteless jokes, this movie defiled what made Doctor Seuss great in the first place.",

Alec and Mike starred in this movie and they haven't shown their faces on the big screen since. why did he have to ruin his good name? these sick people need to stop turning Dr.Seuss classics into cinema trash. i can tell Dr. Seuss himself is tossing and turning in his grave. this movie was not meant for children. haven't the writers ever thought about the children? my sister was obsessed with this movie and it drove her insane.

But it also fails as the sort of moronic moralizing parents think they are giving their kids by plunking them down in front of a TeeVee. And it has probably the most blasphemous use of a song from 'Sgt Pepper' in all history.Of these, the most interesting to me is the Seuss dimension. The Seuss world - just like his stories - is one that pretends to be something but is actually something quite different. His moral is that morals are incidental, something that is more apparent through the drawings (an what they represent) than in the words and what they seem to mean.Those drawings are more about the process of drawing than in efficiently representing things. That's why kids find them so appealing: they know they are drawings and all the odd things on the page are a result of playing with the pen rather than 'seeing' something. Seuss's world is a world where you do something - give a moralistic story or draw a fantastic drawing - but along the way, you have fun in a shared space between drawer and watcher. (That, incidentally, is the story in this case.)The producers of this film completely misunderstood this central notion. They have sets and characters that superficially resemble the drawings. And they stage somewhat accordingly, for instance the two kids often stand side by side facing the camera but talking to each other. But this is all mechanical, no joy. No joy.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",

The result is almost always silly,weird, and in this case very frightening.\nMyers tries hard to shine in his role,but he`s pretty creepy. The makeup does not transform him into a \"real\" creature like Jim Carrey in \"the grinch\",but makes him look more like what he actually is:  a  fat comedian/geek in a furry costume.Most of the humor is cynical, and fits a british comedy better than this one.

            "content": "First off I loved this movie as a kid but looking back on it now I see why a lot of people dislike it. I also read Doctor Seuss books as a kid but the 1970s Horton Hears A Who and The Lorax are still better then this, Jim Carrey's The Grinch was better then this. Jim Carrey usually portrays goofy, quirky, and eccentric characters. He was expressive enough to give a memorable yet somewhat cringeworthy performance even through a furry tight costume that he had to have techniques on how to resist torture taught to him by a navy seal.Mike Myers wasn't the right casting as the cat. Myers is better in animated roles or just being himself. Austin Powers and Shrek are good but he couldn't capture the magic he brought to those characters and this movie clearly tried to hide the fact that he was clearly sweating and about to pass out of heatstroke inside that cat suit.Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin gave no emotion to their characters and looked like they were only doing this because their parents forced them to do it for money. The only redeeming quality to this movie which is also kinda sad that it is, is the characters who weren't in the book and only in this movie. Sean Hayes gave a hilarious over the top performance as the crazy mysophobic boss of the kid's mother. He is honestly more funny then Mike Myers and maybe even would have done a better job as the cat. Amy Hill plays the kid's narcoleptic babysitter and although she is a shockingly offensive Chinese stereotype, the gags around her and some of her lines were funny. Alec Baldwin although clearly not happy and not caring one bit about the role and seeming to have only accepted it for a easy paycheck, did a surprisingly fine job as the gold digging piggish lazy messy neighbor. Aside from the toilet humor, Shameless marketing, and offensive jokes, this movie has a cheap generic pop song and generic happy ending.

            "content": "You know it's funny: As a kid I grew up liking this but now that i'm older I realize this's a terrible adaptation of Dr. Seuss' famous kid's book of the same name. While it's based on the book it adds a lot of unnecessary filler to pad out the length. The only good things to come out of this movie are the sets, props and the effects. They really look like the world of Seuss popped out of the book and into the big screen. Where it goes down hill are the acting and the out-of-place adult jokes. The main characters are Sally and Conrad Walden played by Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin. They're forced to stay home with a babysitter (Amy Hill) while their mom Joan Walden (Kelly Preston) goes to work. In addition to having to tolerate eachother they also have to deal with the titular character (played by Mike Myers) who somehow broke in and hid in their house. To begin with, the kids don't really emote that much making them sound like robots. They're kid actors so i'll give them a little leeway though i've seen them act in other movies where they do a much better job.Sally's an uptight control-freak while Conrad's a rebellious troublemaker which needless to say, causes them to butt heads with each other like siblings do. I get the purpose was to give them more personality but I felt like with the book they were more laid back. But that's just a nitpick as the other big problem is the Cat himself. He's supposed to be wisecracking and upbeat and while he does get a few good laughs most of the time he's lewd and obnoxious. It also doesn't help that he tells a lot of adult jokes that just don't fit into this story. Myers also seems restrained in the costume. He's not very expressive like Jim Carrey in the Grinch. While I don't like that movie either, to give credit where it's due Carrey (and Taylor Momsen) were one of the few good things out of that movie due to how expressive they were in their makeup and costumes. They made it work. Myers just doesn't.Speaking of not fitting into the story, Alec Baldwin plays the main antagonist Lawrence \"Larry\" Quinn their lazy, condescending neighbor who wants to get Conrad out of the picture by sending him to military school in hopes of marrying their mom. The original story didn't need one; rather the things The Cat put them through was enough. The kids had to find a way to contain his chaos within the house without destroying it which already was compelling. Here it's just reduced to a typical kids movie: Have a wacky sidekick and an over-the-top adult villain. In spite of The Cat's attempts to give the kids ideas on how to have fun at home he does a lot more harm than good: He slowly and slowly begins to wreck the house with his gadgets and later on his hideous minions Thing 1 and Thing 2. They're just as horrifying as the Who's from the Grinch. They look like sub-species of the Who's!Things get to a point where they have to venture outside the house to retrieve their dog who gets thrown out of the window by one of the Things. This leads to them having to avoid Larry as well as the neighborhood kids who are having a birthday party. One scene I find genuinely funny is when The Cat gets mistaken for a pi\u00f1ata leading to scene where he goes to his happy place. It's lewd but it's also one of the few jokes that still get a laugh from me. After retrieving the dog they lose Larry at a party (where Paris Hilton makes a cameo for some reason). If you read the book you know how it ends. All's well ends well I guess. The big problem with this movie's that it strays far from the source material. It has very little of the charm or spirit from the book or the short. Most of the jokes are offensive, unfunny and/or just fall flat, the acting's mainly stiff and the original moral's lost. The original moral from the book is that it's ok to cause trouble as long as it never goes too far. That's a rare message and it was well done. This movie doesn't have that. It's interesting to note that during the chase scene The Cat pretends to lose his hat in order to see how Conrad and Sally get out their situation which's interesting but like I said those moments are few and far between. It goes without saying this's one of Dr. Seuss' worst movie adaptations.I've heard some people say that this's ahead of its time in terms of it's style and humor but honestly I never got that from this. Dr. Seuss' rolling in his grave right now. Bottom line, put this cat down for good.",

Fanning was actually one of the best things in the film, apart from the fish, who I adored.The only other decent thing in this film would be the sets and scenery, which felt like it was taken out of Dr Seuss' imagination. It was a whole new world and was very different and bold. Bright colours, textured surfaces, skinny buildings, it FELT like a storybook.

But most of the time he uses an annoying east coast accent. Mike Meyers may've been taking the east coast accent he'd used in \"Saturday night live's\" \"Coffee talk\" skit. Anyways, the first annoying character in the movie is the kid's mom's boss who yells \"fiiiirrrreeeeddddd!!!\" at any slightest provocation interfering with cleanliness, since he was a clean freak. I thought he was just a freak. Next one is mom's possible future fianc\u00e9 who secretly hates her kids, especially the son who he wants to secretly send off to military school, but he won't show that side of himself to mom. They're both jerks in that stupid annoying bad movie way. Next is Mrs. Kwan, the babysitter who passes out almost immediately after mom leaves. Then comes the cat. I don't even know where to start with him. He's so more annoying than funny. He says many stupid unfunny jokes and puns, with that annoying voice.

It very understandably will make people want to rip that horrible cat suit off Meyers and throw it into the nearest bonfire, or if they can't find one just set fire to the suit themselves. Then tell Meyers to wash off the horrible cat makeup, stop that annoying way of talking, and stop those horrible jokes, or you'll have him arrested. The only reason I rated this movie a 2 instead of 1 is because I do not believe in rated a movie 1 when two of the main character are innocent little kids, especially when the makers of this film were stupid enough to have one of the adult characters say things so inappropriet in front of the kids. And I'm not the only one, I have read several reviewers complaining about the hoe joke. Oh, and we see Paris Hilton dancing in some underground club. Yeh, that just fits in the rest of the film. The rest of the bad film.",

(Alec Baldwin) messing with his navel (UGH!). The whole mean dealing with the babysitter from Thailand. Plus (Thing 1) and (Thing 2) looked like real, evil and so ugly demons!Mike Myers played some of his \"very adult\" moments but in the wrong place. I don't see what's the need for seeing him looking to a playboy poster-like (of the mother!) to have his hat gets longer while we're supposed to be in a kids movie! Or the talk about cutting off the balls! Or seeing him chopping off his tail! And I was sick of his annoying \"Oh Yeah!\"; it sounded endless!The make-up as a Jamaican produced such a fearful view. Or dancing in a girl's dress; that was totally emetic (Now that deserves a special Razzie apart!). The actress who played the mom seemed silly. The 2 lead kids weren't less ridiculous. This is the movie where the good guy and the bad guy both aren't ashamed of burping loudly! And I just want to know who did come up with the idea of (Paris Hilton) for a cameo in a Cat in The Hat movie?? She can fit more for The Cat in the Hat; The Pornographic Version!Then, the main tragedy; the pace. This is even bad as a cartoon. Simply it's not a smart move to play a whole live movie as a Roger Rabbit movie for ALL THE TIME. Can you stand being in a speeding racing car for 80 minutes?! This is nerve-wracking. There is no station to stop, or to calm down. I thought that the songs may handle this mission, but they didn't. This was heavy at places, and so wacky at others, both ways it annoyed while being entertaining. Thank god that it didn't annoy more!All in all, it was a kids movie, slightly sickening and adrenaline helpless junky in the same time!",

Mike Myers stars in the title role as the mischievous feline with the red-and-white striped magical stovepipe hat, a film adaptation of the beloved Dr. Seuss book, `The Cat in the Hat'. The Cat stirs up mischief wherever he goes, especially for Conrad and Sally Walden, (Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning) two children who are home alone with their pet fish.  With nothing to do, Conrad begins to mess-up the house by riding a board down the stairs.  Their single mom (Kelly Preston) is having the company party that night, and the house must be neat and clean or her germ-o-phobic boss will fire her.  She orders the children not to take one step into the living room.  Of course, when the Cat arrives, he is part of a wrecking crew that destroys the house.  The young children in the audience loved the movie. Adults will have to tolerate it for their kids.  You can take your children to see this movie, I didn't hear any bad words, however, one was beeped out and another was an acronym for the car that could be spelled out.

The main character was the worst part of the entire movie.

Mr Humberfloob's extreme hygiene standards are a problem however, as she has to ensure her two kids don't make any sort of mess. Arranging a babysitter seems sufficient precaution but nobody reckoned on the cat in the hat arriving \u0096 a force for chaos that immediately sucks the kids into his world. With such bad reviews and so much bad press I naturally didn't even think of going to see this in the cinema or paying good money for it but, with friend's kids getting the DVD out to watch it I thought 'what the hey' and watched it. My first impression was that it was not as bad as people say \u0096 although it is far from being a really good film. The plot doesn't really capture the fun and wonder of the real Cat and instead it is more chaotic than anything else. The story is no more than a series of set pieces and bringing in some sort of subplot with Quinn didn't do anything to help this.However, despite not matching the spirit of Dr Seuss that many viewers will have been looking for, the film manages to be quite fun.The films looks good and it moves at a good pace that helps cover up the many weaknesses it has. It also has enough scenes of people falling over to please the kids but also is sporadically funny enough to keep adults from passing out. A big part of this is the playing from Myers. He may not look like the real Cat (although the makeup is good) but he has a silly energy that kept me watching despite everything else. He is not as clever or witty as the original book but he is quick and funny and, for me, he made the film worth seeing. Sadly nobody else really does much. Baldwin has nothing to do, Preston is OK but in the background and it is only really in the deliberately small roles where value is added by the likes of Hayes, Fanning and Castellaneta.Overall this is not a great film but kids should like it due to the energy and chaos it delivers while adults will be amused by Myers hyper delivery. The reliance on special effects and obvious humour will not appeal to everyone and I can understand why fans of the book will avoid this version but it is not as bad as people say and worth a rent if you're just looking to distract young children without getting bored yourself.",

Only the superhero cartoons are the ones that people can salvage decent films out of, as we have learnt this millennium.The idiots at Hollywood have given a $110,000,000 budget (as IMDb tells me) to a director that nobody has even heard of, to create a film about a stupid cat. The over-the-top settings and special effects do not add to the film, but they only make it even more sad and pathetic. And that disaster was a few bob, I'll tell you that. There is no brain behind the film, and the talent of Mike Myers is wasted. He has done better films.Much better films (Saving Private Ryan, Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring, Jurassic Park) have been done on substantially smaller budgets than this travesty. Despite grossing a lot of money, this film really fails to engage, and they really should have got a half-decent director to do this. On a smaller budget, this film could have been better, and actually given us more character and plot than money-burning special effects and pointless Universal Studios ads. The Cat in the Hat was a great cartoon, but is absolute doggy-dos as a film. It also didn't have to be crude. Despite the fact that Cat and the Hat required lots of silly effects and settings, a better film could have been done.A complete cowpat of a film! Avoid! 2/10P.S. If the budget I saw for this film ($109,000,000) is wrong, my comment is worthless.",

            "review_title": "Good production design and one or two amusing gags or concepts, but Myers' obnoxious performance and crass delivery make this excruciating",
            "content": "In the average town of Anville, a brother and sister consisting of uptight rule driven Sally (Dakota Fanning) and mischievous chaos prone Conrad (Spencer Breslin) are left home with narcoleptic babysitter Mrs. Kwan (Amy Hill) as their mother (Kelly Preston) tries desperately to keep her home clean while also fulfilling the demands of her germophobic OCD boss (Sean Hayes). The kids sit around their house bored until the arrival of a giant cat (Mike Myers) arrives and entices them into a series of chaotic misadventures that escalate. When the mess becomes too great the trio have to work to clean it up before their mother's boyfriend Larry (Alec Baldwin) can show their mother the \"mother of all messes\".Beginning development in 1997, the film was originally envisioned as a vehicle for Tim Allen as the Cat before scheduling conflicts the The Santa Clause sequel forced him to drop out. Development was sped along after the mammoth success of Jim Carrey's How the Grinch Stole Christmas with Mike Myers becoming attached to star as part of an out of court settlement involving producer Brian Grazer and a soured deal with Myers involving broken promises where Myers backed out of a planned film based on his SNL character Dieter which resulted in a protracted legal battle. The film marks the directorial debut of production designer Bo Welch (also carried over from the cancelled Dieter movie). The movie was noted for its panning by critics and audiences and the declaration from Dr. Seuss's widow that no further live-action films would be approved by the Seuss estate. The movie is undoubtedly bad and all of it can be traced to Myers.Myers as the is simply awful, while in concept he's supposed to be a Bugs Bunny like wisecracker whose chaos is good natured, in practice he comes off as a creepy, leering, malicious, and sometimes perverted weirdo who's more off putting than endearing. Myers is a proven comic talent with his work in Wayne's World, Austin Powers, and Shrek showing just how capable a comic talent he truly is, but here it's clear that no one's told him to rein it in as he's not playing a character but more of a delivery for his familiar schtick (with Myers Scottish \"shrek \" voice, and even his Dr. Evil voice reappearing). Not only does Myers not fit in the Dr. Seuss world with low brow gags involving him looking at a picture of the kids' mother like it's a Playboy centerfold (with an extending hat gag) or scenes where he almost says naughty words, but Myers often seems to be doubling as his own laugh track as the cat periodically uses a wheezing chortling laugh to cap off his punchlines that's both obnoxious and creepy. The makeup used to create the cat is massively misguided as Myers is clearly having trouble not only moving as his arms never go above his shoulders, but his facial expressions are limited so that he looks uncomfortable with even his chortling laugh looking more pained than joyous.Outside of Myers, the characters are all differing degrees of annoying or bland. Alec Baldwin's two modes consist of a phony self aggrandizing salesman persona, and a slovenly lout who pits his nose and navel in an embarrassing gross-out fat suit scene. Sean Hayes of Will & Grace in a duel role plays the voice of the Fish in a screeching manner, and plays the germophobic boss with overenunciation and mugging to an excruciating degree. Kelly Preston, Spencer Breslin, and Dakota Fanning all give the least awful performances by virtue of being rather bland with Preston as workaholic mom and Breslin and Fanning basically playing somehow more cartoonish versions of Bart and Lisa Simpson (which have less gravity and believability than an actual cartoon). On occasion there were some decent sight gags such as the Cats car S. L. O. W. that has an amusing moment where three different steering wheels come out from the console for everyone to drive, and some of the production design could occasionally look impressive. Bo Welch as an Academy Award winning production designer on many Tim Burton films and Barry Sonnenfeld films has shown he has a good visual eye and has even done some good directing work on Patrick Warburton's The Tick series and Netflix's A Series of Unfortunate Events. Apparently behind the scenes Myers would often belittle Welch and take over comic direction basically leaving Welch little control over material or direction so it's likely Welch isn't all that much to blame as Myers diva behavior with uncredited re-writes and direction most likely resulted in the misfires.The Cat in the Hat is a bad movie with a nice coat of paint. While the production design can be impressive (even if it feels like a bouncier version of suburbia from Edward Scissorhands), the performances, thin story, and crass lowbrow humor make this an excruciating sit. With the unnerving makeup on Myers coupled with his method of laughing at all his own jokes, The Cat is one of the most annoying comic performances to headline a major would be blockbuster.",

            "content": "Hollywood is so scared to try and make films with a fresh script and they're running out of popular books to exploit so the studios are now turning to Dr. Seuss and raping his stories with big stars in the cast. Story really has nothing to do with the book so this film is about two kids left with a babysitter while their mother is at work but will return later to host an important business party. Joan (Kelly Preston) is the mother of an icy tattletale named Sally (Dakota Fanning) and a trouble making brat called Conrad (Spencer Breslin) and she calls Mrs. Kwan (Amy Hill) to come over and babysit but she's a narcoleptic and immediately falls asleep. Meanwhile, their neighbor Lawrence Quinn (Alec Baldwin) wants to marry Joan and send Conrad to military school and he keeps snooping around and checking on them.*****SPOILER ALERT*****While at home the kids are visited by The Cat (Mike Myers) who wants to teach them some of life's lessons and makes them sign a contract and along with the help from Thing 1 and Thing 2 he starts to systematically tear up the house. After a series of events their home is practically destroyed and Sally and Conrad throw out The Cat and decide to face the wrath of their mother and take the blame.Bo Welch is making his debut as a director but he's best known as a terrific production designer and I have to admit that this is a very colorful film to look at but that's about the best thing I can say about this. Like \"The Grinch That Stole Christmas\" this only resembles the Dr. Seuss story in title and character only and the rest is a dizzying assortment of visual sight gags and annoying skits with Myers hamming it up like a nightmare version of Bert Lahr with the same type of laugh. Some of the material that's presented would seemingly be enough reason for the Seuss estate to file a lawsuit from Myers dressed like Carmen Miranda and rubbing himself to the two barfing scenes or giving the initials to a type of vehicle that spells s**t. I found the \"Grinch\" film annoying and lacking the spirit of both the book and the television special but that now seems much better than this clich\u00e9 riddled sellout. I'm not complaining to much about the inappropriate material for children but what I do consider wrong is seating a child in front of a piece of commercial nonsense like this because their young minds are going to think that this is what they are supposed to consider entertainment. Is this film really suitable for kids? I'll let everyone make that decision themselves but just remember that the high profile cameo comes from none other than Paris Hilton!",

Just for the record, I never did want to see this movie in the first place, but my mother, for some reason or other, bought it. I curse that day even now.Moving on, The Cat was so OOC that it was hard to watch more than the first 20 minutes. I saw absolutely no resemblance of Mike Myers' abomination to the original Cat in the Hat other than the fact that they were both cats wearing a hat! Sally was obscure. I do not recall any \"rule-adoring\" Sally any more than I recall any \"rule-breaking\" Conrad (playing the part of \"I\", I'm assuming) in the book. And when it comes down to Dakota Fanning, I think she's an amazing actress that somehow or other landed in the middle of a real 'cat'-astrophe.My two favorite characters from the story (Thing 1 and 2) were absolutely appalling. They had no real place in the movie, looked nothing like they were supposed to, and randomly appeared and disappeared at the most inappropriate of times.If you have any respect for Dr. Suess whatsoever, or are expecting another great tale like The Grinch, avoid this movie at all costs!!!!",

            "content": "Introduction:The Cat in the Hat is a film deserving of all the criticism, hatred, and all around dislike: that it gets. A disgrace against all of mankind, and an abomination to the film industry, as well as a film that makes Dr. Seuss role in his grave; this is a film is not worth watching, and must be locked away to never be seen again, and just be forgotten by humanity.Everything Bad About It:The film lacks understanding of what made the original book by Dr. Seuss so good. And I hate the film for this. It just thinks that Dr. Seuss's works are just simple kids books. Even though it should've been treated with a little more respect. Dr. Seuss is more than just something that just wrote kids books. He was a man full of creativity, who wrote truly great stories.And this film doesn't get why people love, it just knows that people love them, and it wants to cash in on that fact. Now, I have nothing wrong with making money off it. Film making is a business. But that's no excuse for mediocrity, or making such passionless drivel.From the forced adult jokes, to all the other kinds of jokes that don't land, and the hideous looking sets and costumes. Everything about the film is atrocious. Mike Myers sucks as the title character, the performance is not funny. And the costume is scary looking. And speaking of that. The film shouldn't have been live action. It should've been animated, as Dr. Seuss's drawing style really doesn't translate well to live action films.Also, the abundance of adult jokes in this film simply raises an eyebrow. There are very on the nose adult jokes in this film, and while I don't mind adult jokes in kids films, I mean, I love Shrek. The movie simply has jokes that aren't subtle enough. And Shrek was based on a weird children's book. This film is based on Dr. Seuss, so having these kind of jokes just feels wrong.The film also fails as an adaptation following the book so rarely, and barely having a message. The book had a message that a little rule breaking okay as long as you don't go too far. That's a unique message for a story like that. But this film just forgets about it completely.Conclusion:What else can I really say? The comedy falls flat. It fails as an adaptation. It fails as a kids movie. And it just fails as a film. If I could give it a 0/10, I would. This is one of my five least favorite films. And deserving of the worst kind of hatred. And there is so much I haven't touched on, but I don't wanna spend all night talking about this film.",

Woo hoo, no body seems to mind that she now is frolicking around in her video \"Stars are Blind.\"Overall, 6/10.",

            "content": "The Cat in the Hat was directed by the very talented production designer, Bo Welch; he put on a real over the top, off-key flick, taking on the beloved story The Cat in the Hat, originated by Dr. Seuss. Welch gets a lot of understandable hate for this film, but I think it gets more hate than it deserves. It's safe to say that Cat in the Hat did have potential to be at least par, with decent narration, story telling & some jokes, but with everything being very overcompensated & cringey, the outcome was pretty messy.Dakota Fanning & Spencer Breslin seemed to have a tough time sharing the spolight, having below par performances. They had a handful of okay monents, but their character development was so simple and boring, that at the end of the film, their characters were just flat out annoying. The Cat in my bold opinion was the best part of the film. I don't really know anyone else who would nail this role.... again, idk who would want to play the role, other than maybe Johnny Depp. His jokes were really 50/50, but when they landed, they hit decently almost everytime. If you're a natural fan of Mike Myers, you can almost already imagine what you would be in for. Alec Baldwin is a real talented actor with a great reputation, but I have no clue as to what made him sign for this movie. His character is so laughably bad. As for the Fish and Thing 1 & Thing 2, they were fun additions, but nothing more than plot devices to keep the movie going at it's fast pace.The script is really just one big ball of hit or miss jokes, that doesn't hold any weight whatsoever, with very little charm & wit. If you enjoy Mike Myers, his charisma is just oozing all over this movie. If you can't embrace it from the start, you're going to be in for a rough time.The production design was real fun & colorful; it looked like they took pages right out of the book, and put them into frame. With a big budget, they could've gone bigger, but the setting & set pieces was a big plus for this film.Surprisingly, I enjoyed the creative songs throughout the film. They had this fun flow with catchy rhymes.",

It's not enough that it is atrociously obnoxious and annoying, but what really gets me is how badly they screwed up in adapting such a simple, classic, and straightforward story. Sure, I understand that they had to pad it out, being that it's live action and that the source material is really brief, but still...THIS is the end result?!?! The execution is just ridiculously over the top, in your face, and annoying, Mike Meyers (from \"Shrek\"), who is really just playing a hyper version of himself in a cat costume and makeup, makes me want to carve my eyes out with a rusty spoon. I really don't have that much problem with him in general, but he really went off the deep end here, and I have no idea what he was thinking. I really don't remember much of Alec Baldwin's and Kelly Preston's performance, but I'm sure it's something they wishes wasn't on their resumes. All I remember from Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning is that they spent a fair amount of time frowning at Meyers, as if they knew they were in a giant pile of crap. This is dumb, vile, and one of the biggest slaps to the face of Seuss and his legacy that I've seen, and that's without considering that I wasn't interested in seeing this in the first place, but just happened to because I was at school, the semester was almost over, and the teacher didn't apparently have any respect for our intelligence and thought we, a bunch of high schoolers, would enjoy watching one of her kids movies since she apparently didn't have anything more on our level, or just didn't trust us to watch anything PG-13 or higher since her rep would be on the line. What a bunch of crap. The ONLY thing I can really give this movie in the way of a compliment is that the look is decent, and there's some okay art direction/set design, but even my enjoyment of that is sullied since it's being used in the most lazy and poor attempt to cash in on something great just ofr money. Also, the fact that some of the cast actually managed to recover from this is some sort of miracle. Avoid this one at all costs, especially if you'd prefer to have your childhood not molested.P.S.: To all these male reviewers who thumbs up this movie, maybe you like the secretary's character, because she's sexy and the actress' name was Candace; go watch \"Phineas & Ferb\" instead.",

To read some of these diatribes you would think that people wanted the exact storyline from the book or something close to it. Well, then it would have been a 15 minute movie. This movie IS what it IS...a campy and silly film geared towards young kids with large disposable incomes and not arrested developmental adults that wish they were young kids with large disposable incomes. Sure...Myers sounded a little too much like the Lion in Wizard of Oz sometimes and yes the screenplay was not on par with On the Waterfront, but my kid laughed and left the theater wanting to see it again. My big problem was that a Beatles classic like \"Getting Better\" had to be ripped off by some two bit pop band!!!",

Goodness knows it's there. It ain't the kids, it ain't the script. What is it? It's the stupidity of jokes like: \"Oh! She's a 'ho. I love her but...\" (or whatever). Cheap shots like the hoe joke don't belong in Dr Seuss; indeed, they don't belong in this movie.Oh dear! Electric cars? As green as they are painted, they are Ford Focuses - check the badging. A Ford Focus is NOT electric and certainly not green. A Toyota... well, a Prius, possibly. Product placement, thy name is money or possibly Baal or something else. It certainly ain't an electric car.What makes more sense than most of this travesty is the inclusion of the deleted/extra scenes (which add more sense given their continuity) and the out-takes. OK. Some of them are funny. BUT some of them indicate that specific actors didn't learn their lines. Continually 'screwing-up' during a shoot with children does not excuse the use of the 'f' word. One doesn't wish to point the finger, but, f**k and s**t, appeared to be in constant use on the set.Regardless. This attempt to translate \"The Cat in the Hat\" to the screen fails.

Should you let your kids watch it? Probably no. There are more valuable films for them. Instead watch it yourself. Maybe you'll have a blast.At the end of the day, it's a silly film, the sets looked nice, everything was absurd and Alec Baldwin takes out his dentures, gets his TV repossessed and turns purple just to become an Academy award nominee the next year. 7/10 appreciating it's existence.",

The studio can make another movie based on a Dr. Seuss story, hire another popular comedian and they'll have another hit on their hands.Well, they probably will but it's doubtful children will leave \"The Cat in the Hat\" with the same feeling of awe and wonder that they did with the previous Seuss adaptation. The movie is suffering from an entertainment deficiency, loaded with over-the-top special effects and a funhouse production design but filled with characters who all seem lost in the excess.Real estate agent Joan (Kelly Preston) will be hosting a house party for agency clients in the evening. Unfortunately, her rambunctious 12-year-old son Conrad (Spencer Breslin) has a knack for disobeying rules and she fears he'll wreck the house before she returns. Grounded for making a mess in the kitchen, Conrad must stay home with a baby-sitter along with his 9-year-old control freak sister Sally (Dakota Fanning) who does not want to play with kids she views as immature.The baby-sitter soon falls asleep leaving Conrad and Sally alone on a rainy day. Before boredom can really set in however, a mysterious creature invades their home, The Cat in the Hat (Mike Myers). Upon arrival, the Cat quickly tries to help the two kids have fun around the house while two-faced neighbor Larry Quinn (Alec Baldwin) schemes to hook up with the mother and boot out Conrad to military school.Situations escalate as the Cat's pranks lead to destruction and the escape of the family dog. The kids and the Cat must retrieve the runaway canine from Quinn and contain the mess that's been made in the house before Joan gets back home.The original book by Dr. Seuss did not really have much of a plot, just a scenario about a magical cat relieving the boredom of a rainy day. Because of these humble origins, the movie is for the most part aimless. There is no true rhyme or reason for much that happens in the movie, just a series of things that seem to be happening on screen.To make up for the limited story in the book, the movie is filled with numerous subplots to pad out the time, like a journey into town and a trip through the now magically deformed house, none of which adding anything meaningful to the original story.This might not be too bad if the movie at least had good characters to fall back on, but as it is the main players don't seem to know what to do with themselves. What's left is just an empty Hollywood product, filled with noise and spectacle but no heart.As the Cat, Myers seems to be invoking a strange mixture of The Cowardly Lion and Willy Wonka. Part con artist, part entertainer and part nut case, Myers at least seems to be having a lot of fun in costume. For the first 45 minutes, the Cat almost carries the entire movie on his own.But the Cat is never a likable person, and in reality Myers seems to be back on \"Saturday Night Live\" in an overlong skit spoofing the character instead of actually playing him. In the book the Cat was whimsical and accident prone, but never really dangerous. Here he seems to delight in placing himself and the children in jeopardy. I don't know about you, but I'm sure Dr. Seuss never wanted the Cat to brandish a knife and threaten a doppelganger that \"I'll get you! And I'll make it look like an accident!\"Earlier this year I lauded \"Dickie Roberts\" for having somewhat realistic kids given the weird situation. The same praise cannot be said here. These are the epitome of Hollywood children - the type of brats who deserve a serious punishment but are spared the rod because they learn their lesson in the end. Cue the sentimental music.Fanning, a young rising star in films like \"I am Sam\" and \"Sweet Home Alabama\" is not given much character here. Where she was once bright-eyed and happy, now she's desensitized and apathetic. Breslin is a loudmouth to no end, and I was secretly hoping he would have been sent to military school.Baldwin actually gives the best performance in the movie. He's not really funny but at least he plays his character appropriately given the scenario. Also, his character Quinn doesn't rely on an 11th-hour cop-out to win over audience respect like the others do. He's evil, but in an old-fashioned fun way.If \"The Cat in the Hat\" is a big hit, expect other Dr. Seuss books to be turned into movies in the future, and dread them. This movie may entertain the young, but older audiences will storm out of theaters disillusioned at the terrible hoax that has been played on them.Four out of ten stars. There is nothing here worthy of the book that has been a childhood favorite for decades.",

Dakota Fanning was adorable. Some of it fell flat. It was a flawed film. They never explained where he came from. But who cares. It was the kind of film that had to be short to be good and it was, just 1 hr 14 mts I think, and thats really short these days.

I couldn't believe the horrible jokes that were being made in a movie for CHILDREN!!

I can not believe he could make this film and think in any way that it would be a good movie for CHILDREN to watch. Then I really have to question anyone that previewed this movie before its release (the studio executives and others) and allowed it to still be released.

Of course, these repeat viewings are due in part to the fact that even premium cable plays the same movie 100x times a month, but the point is, The Cat In The Hat grows on you. It's a decent, inventive comedy with some funny moments and a great cast. But is it an ideal family movie??I have a problem with films clearly targeted at children that contain sexual double-entendres. The reasoning the movie studios have for such a practice is that this way, the film will appeal to adults as well as children--so they think. When a teen comedy like Napoleon Dynamite has less sexual references/blue language than The Cat In The Hat, there is a problem. A parent shouldn't have to face a question like \"what did he mean when he talked to the garden hoe that way and kissed it?\" I found most of these blue jokes funny as an adult, but I wouldn't want my child watching them.The film this most reminded me of was Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory--Mike Myers plays the sardonic, somewhat dangerous (though ultimately soft- hearted) Wonka-like Cat, who turns the stuffy lives of Sally and Conrad upside down. Dakota Fanning & Spenser Breslin as the kids are wonderful--the children act mostly like adults (in contrast to the childlike Cat), and these two actors do a great job. There is not one moment during the film that I am not painfully aware of the fact that the Cat is Mike Myers in a furry costume doing shtick. Myers never stops being Myers. Sometimes his jokes work (the \"I'm Easy\" musical interlude after he gets his 'nads smashed in), sometimes they don't (the cooking show segment was really unfunny). His facial makeup is a little less grotesque than Jim Carrey's in The Grinch, but it's still kinda ugly & disturbing. Alec Baldwin makes a fine villain--but I can't help feeling that a role that highlights his paunch and general run-down appearance since his days as the hottie that starred in films like The Shadow is ultimately a bad career move. And Sean Hayes IS Tony Randall (him and David Hyde-Pierce should duke it out).Makes a decent rental if you haven't seen it, and a bizarrely addictive viewing experience on cable for this reviewer. But I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 11 unless you're one o' them hipster parents.",

This follow-up, however, another adaptation of a classic Dr. Seuss story, has generally been more poorly received than its predecessor, and rightfully so! The story features two young siblings, Sally and Conrad. Sally is very obedient, while Conrad tends to do the opposite of what he is told, which could get him sent to military school. One day, the two siblings are left at home with a babysitter. Their mother intends to have a house meeting that night, and expects the kids to keep the house clean. After their babysitter falls asleep, a strange two-legged, talking, human-sized cat suddenly appears in the house! This creature is the Cat in the Hat, and the siblings' pet fish warns them that the cat means trouble! Nonetheless, Sally and Conrad begin to have fun with the Cat in the Hat, but it soon gets out of control, and the house is far from clean! Before seeing this, I wondered how they could make a full-length movie out of the story. \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" has more of a plot than \"The Cat in the Hat\", and it's easier to imagine it being made into a full-length movie. \"The Cat in the Hat\" is a beginner book, after all. Just like this movie's predecessor, they obviously had to add at lot to the story in order to make it full-length, but even still, the plot is lacking. If there were a lot of funny gags in the movie, they could make up for the lack of plot, but the gags are mostly lame, and sometimes put a confused look on my face. Some things here just don't belong in a kids' movie, such as one line about military school (\"It's just like summer camp, except with brutal forced marches and soul-crushing discipline.\"), the political humour in the part where Sally and Conrad watch the news with their babysitter before she falls asleep, the Cat farting with his bare buttocks exposed, the \"Dirty hoe\" joke, etc. Mike Myers playing the Cat in the Hat had potential, but even his performance isn't usually funny, and doesn't save the film.I'm far from being the first one to criticise this movie. In fact, it seems that it has received a lot more criticism than praise, which it deserves. I'm not even sure if my 4/10 rating is low enough! For adults, I don't recommend this \"Cat in the Hat\" adaptation, and for kids, well, I'm not sure. Many consider this movie too raunchy for a kids' movie, and I can see where they're coming from. For some kids, some of the parts that are inappropriate for a kids' movie (like the examples I've given in the above paragraph) might go over their heads. Well, it's up to parents to decide whether their kids should watch this film or not, but remember the PG rating, and also remember that it's not Dr. Seuss!",

I think it proves that many of the people who went to see this film had no idea of what to expect from Dreamworks and Mike Myers. If you like the Austin Powers movies you will really like this. No it wasn't some dumb children's Disney movie. It was edgy and had a more of a sophisticated interpretation of the original Dr. Seuss book. I'm guessing the problem is that most of those were expecting a re-enactment of the original children's book. And I doubt seriously Mike Myers or Dreamworks would do such a movie as that. My philosophy on movie and books is simply they are not one and of the same. The children's classic The Cat In the Hat was meant to be one of the first books a child could learn to read. It featured a wonderful use of colorful words to go along with the wonderful illustrations of that era of printed children's publishing. If that is what one expects then they would be best just stick to the classic original children's book. I would wager a bet that most of the parents who complained about this movie never bothered to give their children the book. Instead they just take their brats to the multiplex and expect them to have the same experience as actually reading the children's book.No this is a highly entertaining and humorous critic of modern American life. The character of Mr. Humberfloob (Sean Hayes) and Quinn (Alec Baldwin) along with the mom played by Kelly Preston and the two wonderful child actors do in fact present a satire of modern life. No, children like Sally did not have Palm Pilot organizers in the original book. And no the children in the original book were not as uptight and materialistic as those of 2003. So naturally the Cat (Mike Myers) had to be more sophisticated and edgy. Bottom line this movie is a view of modern day life in uptight urban America. It simply follows the storyline from Dr. Seuss's children's book. It was not meant to be a remake of the printed book. And if there are those out there that thought so then God help them.

I'm not going to waste time by explaining the story so instead I'll just break apart every little bit of this film. The worst part about this film is the cat played by Mike Myers. First of all he looks terrifying. Myers always looks like he's being restrained by the costume. You can just see that he's cringing throughout the whole film. The other problem is his dialog. His dialog is horrible. Now this isn't really Myers' fault so I'm not blaming him but first of all he doesn't rhyme. I wouldn't really be focusing on this if it weren't based on Seuss but it is, so there is no excuse. Instead he makes dirty jokes, he references pop culture, and he does everything that had almost nothing to do with the original story. The kids are the other problem with the film. Conrad (Spencer Breslin) is a delinquent, and Sally (Dakota Fanning) is a control freak. That is literally all the character depth that they have. They don't even try to make them interesting.

I don't know what when through the minds of the makers of this film but I hope there is some kind of justice for all of the people who paid to see it.

I kind of wanted to see it. It looked like a cute family film. Trust me, it was. The only problem about that it is only a cute family film, nothing more, nothing less. It was okay.This movie begins just like the book. A huge, disturbing cat comes to a family's house with only two children in it when their mother went away. He wants them to have fun. He introduces them to Thing One and Thing Two. That is basically the only thing that is like the book. Conrad opens the Thing crate that slowly unleashes the Cat's world. The children's dog gets loose and they get him. By the time they get back from their little adventure finding the dog their whole house turns into a huge purple world. They have an adventure to shut the crate. They shut the crate. Everything is back to normal, then the house falls down. They kick the Cat out. He comes back and fixes the house. The mother gets home.Overall, this is just a movie. I also have a lot of questions about this film. Most importantly why didn't any of the neighbors know that their entire house fell down? Wouldn't they hear the crashing wood? It is just bizarre. They are also some cute scenes, like the cooking scene where the Cat cuts off his tail and almost curses. It cuts to We'll Be Right Back screen. Anyway, I did not mind watching this, but really if you have young children, just rent this.5/10Recommended Films: How The Grinch Stole Christmas.",

When I first heard about The Cat in The Hat coming out, I was excited because I liked The Grinch, and I thought this would be good as well. Boy, was I soo wrong!!*Some spoilers*First of all, Mike Meyers probably wasn't the best choice as the Cat. All I kept noticing was how he used his past characters' voices for the Cat. For example, he becomes part of an infomercial, and he uses his Fat Bastard voice from Austin Powers. Throughout the movie I also could hear some Coffee Talk and Austin Powers himself thrown around in there. It was kind of annoying.Then we get to the numerous parts that don't belong in a kid's movie. Some include: calling a garden hoe a \"dirty ho\", giving an acronym for a car that spells a profanity, screaming \"SON OF A ...\" before being bleeped by fake censors, an aerobic video that includes orgasmic-like sounds, a cameo by Paris Hilton, making fun of their babysitter and actually riding her as if they were on a rollercoaster...the list goes on and on.\nI don't know what these people were thinking when they decided to put this stuff in the movie. Yea, it may be funny for adults, but this is a children's movie! If you wanted to get more adults to come see it, make it PG-13, then have a ball with all of these double entendres.

The jokes fall a bit flat, but the scene where the Cat makes cake with a fire extinguisher was just really hilarious. Other than that, it's just not a great movie. I just like how they added some crazy things that are just guilty pleasure.It's an alright movie for those between 12 to 15. People who disliked this movie are mostly parents who thought the movie was too inappropriate or people who didn't like the respect to the source material.Yes, they could treat the source material better, but what else could you expect from an 80-minute movie? The ridiculous plot points should be fully expected. However, the sex jokes and toilet humour would be better if it were not in The Cat in the Hat, though, but in a teen movie. This probably has about as much sexual humour, violence, and language as a typical PG-13 teen movie, such as Mean Girls.It would be better if the kid-unfriendly jokes be put into a lowbrow teen comedy, with kid- friendly jokes in The Cat in the Hat. The jokes are funny enough to work, even if they aren't great. They may fall slightly flat but less flat than many other movies.Oh, and I thought Mike Myers was fine. I didn't dislike him in this role. The visuals were great and the Cat's makeup is done really well. The biggest problem was that the humour was WAY out of place. Should they have not misplaced the humour, this movie would've been better reviewed and the rightful movie would've been better.+ Some LOL moments+ Some nice music+ Fast-paced plot is fun and never boringMay not be for young kidsJokes can fall flatDisrespectful to source materialRating: 6: As a standalone movie, this is decent.

The acting was bad, the plot was tweaked too much, and the humor was surprisingly very crude.It starts with Conrad and Sally, A rule breaker and a future sheriff. When their Mother has to go to work, she gets Mrs. Kwan to babysit. Possibly the lone funny part in the movie is when Mrs. Kwan is watching a Taiwanese court room, a `la C-SPAN. She soon falls asleep, and here comes the Cat.The film starts to spiral out of control. The Cat came to try to let the kids have some fun. He's got Thing 1 and Thing 2, Who suddenly start trashing the house. He improvises a TV Infomercial, and accidentally slices his tail off. And when the Cat goes full Carmen Miranda, it's not funny. Possibly his only funny disguise is as a hippie activist. And there's a fish who tries warning the kids about the Cat.Too bad he didn't warn us this film was as much fun as sour milk, or chopping your tail off.Soon the kids are outside looking for the family dog, who has the key to a crate on his collar. If the crate is not locked soon, their house will be home to the Cat's universe. Here it gets a little more interesting, but not enough to save the film.The acting, overall, is horrible. Mike Meyers brings his brand of irreverent Austin Powers humor to the Cat, Saying things like \"You dirty ho\" and imagining himself as a woman for the rest of his life after a whack in the testicles while posing as a pinata. Spencer Breslin is great as the trouble-making Conrad, and Dakota Fanning is cute as Sally, though they alone are not enough to save this horrendous Aortic Dissection waiting to kill John Ritter(accident waiting to happen). Alec Baldwin's slick and slimey Lawrence Quinn is disgusting, ever trying to woo the kids mom, who is played by Kelly Preston. And Sean Hayes is Mr. Humberfloob, Mom's boss, and is also the voice of the fish. The latter three are also bland.Overall, if I were a parent I would not take my kids who are into potty humor, cause there's plenty of it and more. Save your $7.00 and see something else. As the late great Dr. Seuss once said,It is fun to have fun, But you have to know how. Really, Universal, stop!

The plot drags on and on, and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue. The \"witty\" parental remarks are disgusting, not funny (I remember some awful comment about a garden hoe being compared to, well, a type of person people call a \"ho\"). Even though the movie is really short, it seemed to last FOREVER. Do not waste your time. I know small kids who hated this movie. If children can't stand it, I do not know how any adults can.

That's different for me 15 years later.I just watched this randomly with my roommate today, getting nostalgic, and realized that this movie is nothing but a vehicle for Mike Myers' comedy. That would be fantastic if it wasn't poorly written, with a story that completely spins off the rails just to do it. By the time you get to the part where the house gets cleaned, you finally remember the actual story. Plot- The story takes the same basis as the book, but honestly might even miss some pages in terms of what happens. It just becomes one mess, one gag after another with two kids standing there watching. Total excessCharacters- Alec Baldwin is probably the most interesting character alongside Mike Myers in the lead, but the rest are just people. A weird sleepy babysitter, a cookie cutter surburban mom, one good kid, one bad kid. Just enough to make you watch. Dialogue- Really no memorable lines, there are some decent Mike Myers trademarks that'll make you laugh. The musical numbers are cringe worthy. The pacing is so bland it feels like a 1950's Coke commercialProd. Value/Quality- The movie is eye popping, a very unique setting. The cinematography is not bad at all, pretty crisp for a movie that seems like it was hurried.Overall I laughed about five times, and the rest left that weird feeling in my stomach, like I either have to eat or just walk away. It is likeable, just not by someone who looks for good thematic elements, originality in movies. Your kids will like it.",

The problem is that story is so simplistic and short...there's not enough there to MAKE a good movie.To that effect, director Bo Welch created a few new characters for the film, including Alec Baldwin as the nefarious Quinn, who wants to send young Spencer Breslin to military school, and the germ-enfatuated real estate boss Mr. Humberfloob, played by Sean Hayes, who alsos voices the goldfish.Myers struggles to make the cat a lovable character, but unfortunately the material to work with just isn't there. Not to mention that Myers constantly slips into his previous roles...to the point where you see Linda Richman in a ridiculous getup. The makeup is once again a huge problem for Myers, much as it was for Jim Carrey in The Grinch.Baldwin is once again wasted in this film, but then again so is everything else.

Baldwin's character is gross, creepy, pointless and annoying. Overall as a villain, he's very disappointing. If you removed him from the story, nothing would be altered, but the writing and main character are where this movie really falters. Mike Myers as the Cat, is as scary as watching zombies emerge from an acid vat. The makeup looks stiff, and all of his moments just make you winch. At least the makeup on Jim Carey clearly had more effort in the Grinch. In the movie itself, the Cat states he can't rhyme. This is a Dr. Suess icon, why you write that line? Aside from being out of character, the Cat makes dirty jokes that are too adult and disturbing for a movie rated PG. Why can't people remember that Suess' books were child-friendly?Anyways, the movie ends just like the book, but I suggest you refuse to even give it a look.

            "content": "Well, let me stress out in the beginning: I don't know anything about (thus also any book by) Dr. Seuss - except that he was this hotshot writer whom every American seem to love (I remember best the bit Joey did in the first season finale on \"Friends\").As for the movie I found it good enough to earn its points: Mike Myers is funny, though Americans may find him sometimes risqu\u00e9 for a movie aimed at kids. Overall it was a good mix between a typical children's' message film (though the message is not quite clear) and no-non-sense fun. The FX were more than adequate (well, Rhythm & Hues were mentioned in a book about animation by Julius Wiedemann, that's how I discovered the film - my girlfriend liked the fish), the design was sufficiently artificial to make it work, and finally, for a simple tale like this it was short enough (I guess much longer and I'd have had to downrate the picture).As a compensation for the predictable story, the Cat was quite unpredictable in the course of events (as I indicated above I can not relate to the book, so I'm writing for one who has never heard/read/seen the story before), so it never suffered from the downsides of the movie. As for the kids, they were surprisingly un-annoying, as quite often children in movies make you squirm. Spencer Breslin proved again (after Disney's The Kid with Bruce Willis) that he can play a character that I would find annoying without being annoying, and Dakota Fanning (I haven't seen her before in any movie, I think) is a girl to watch out for.So overall, here's a family movie that can please many with (in my free-spirited mind) a slight edge that you know was meant for people to clap their hands over their mouths but actually is quite tame. If you don't mind to actually see the workings of a commercial approach to a story in a movie, you can be entertained for those 82 minutes. (And if you like the technical side of movie making, as I, you can see some mildly interesting features in the motion picture. That's how he earned the little bonus. These days Hollywood often makes super-duper movies that make B-movies appear as technical masterstrokes; witness the awful effects on \"Van Helsing\" or the mostly unconvincing SFX on \"LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring\"!)",

It could have been, but what I saw was more of a reflection, perhaps, of the worst in people. If it's satire, it's not very good satire.To be fair, the film wasn't as unwatchable as all the bad reviews led me to believe it would be. But it's still bad. Above that, it's relentlessly mean-spirited and cynical and I'm not just talking about the fart jokes and what have you. Mike Myers' Cat, apart from not being funny, or funny enough, just does not come across as a likable character. In fact, whatever humor Myers' conveys seems to come from the fact that his character has an unwholesome edge to it; as if he's incapable of playing someone likable while being funny. The other characters barely register or give any basis on which to form any response at all. Lastly, the Cat appeared to teach the kids to have fun. Mostly what I saw was the kids being exasperated or scared out of their wits; most of the time they appeared to be angry at the Cat (with good reason). They didn't seem to me to be having much fun at all.",

After reading bad review after bad review I had decided to not waste my time and money going to see this movie, but my wife had promised my nephew that she would take him to see it and I accompanied them only because I didn't want to spend the evening at home alone. A few points, first I loved the sets they were colorful and exaggerated, very Seuss-like. Kudos go out to Anne Kuljian for this great work.  Next most of the acting was very wooden not one single character was memorable except possibly for the fish, and he didn't get enough screen time. another Mike Meyers was just WRONG for the cat. Although Mr. Myers is a very capable comedic actor and I generally enjoy his performances. In this movie I just couldn't see the cat, all I kept seeing was Austin Powers, Dr. Evil and Fat Bastard. Many people have complained about too much risqu\u00e9 comedy in this movie for it to be a PG rated movie on this point I must agree somewhat. I feel like this movie leans heavily toward the PG-13 rating and I believe this would have been a more appropriate rating. I don't think there were a lot of PG-13 jokes, but they were there, especially the hoe joke. As far as the baseball bat to the crotch, well anyone whatever their age will laugh at that one. Thing 1 and Thing 2,  Their facial make-up were almost exact copies of the Who in `The Grinch who stole Christmas ` that bothered me some. Mr. Humberfloob I just don't know there is something about his character that I like but at the same time, something I loath, overall I think this is a plus. The Quinn character had no redeeming qualities at all and I wanted to see get his comeuppance.  There are may other pluses and minuses to consider but when you've seen a movie and you have to examine it too closely to find what you liked about it something is inherently wrong. Is this move bad? No not in my book I don't think it deserves to be in the bottom 100. So is this movie good? No not by a long shot so what is left? Average, mediocre, ordinary, middling, run of the mill maybe even second-rate. Wait for it to come out on cable or satellite.",

There is some gross humour in the movie, and some innuendo which will probably go over kids heads, but nothing scary about it that should see it have a more restrictive certificate. My daughter has been watching it on and off since she was 2 and was never scared by it. She loves the idea that a giant cat might be hiding under her bed and that you can make cup cakes out of anything, something she is desperate to try.The best things about it are the production design which is superb and Dakota Fanning who is excellent. As a whole the movie is well paced and well-plotted. The Cat is not the cat from the Dr Seuss books except in the sense that he is mischievous and ultimately educates the children. Other characterisations such as Larry and Mr Humberfloob are enjoyable.The film ends on an upbeat note with up-tempo song, which is important.Criticisms that are valid - maybe this is too much of a vehicle for Myers and those who are looking to see a faithful representation of the Dr Seuss books will be disappointed; go read the books instead.All-in-all, an entertaining morality tale where one child learns to behave responsibly, another learns to have fun, the bad guy gets his comeuppance and where giant talking cats exist.

I'm not saying it should've been (heaven forbid) \"Disney-fied,\" but I feel that lately Universal's forgotten when one handles children-based material, it's best you leave it on a \"family-friendly\" level.

BUT, I see where the problems lie, and this is up for the viewer to decide.If you're looking for a Seuss flick, this really, really isn't a good example.  Sure it's very Seuss-esque visually, but aside from the very, very minor narrating, it's really not Seuss at all.  The only similarity between the book and the movie is that there's a couple kids, mom's outta town, it's raining and somehow this huge cat is running around in a silly hat.And this is where the flick is redeemed or condemned for life: all in all it's really a Mike Myers flick.  You got plenty of innuendos, offbeat humor (note: infomercial scene), plenty of morbid jokes and the classic \"Coffee Talk\" accent.  If you aren't a Myers fan to begin with, you should probably skip over this one.I also enjoyed Dakota Fanning and Sean Hayes (esp. the latter) as supporting cast, although the Alec Baldwin thing might not really fit a kids movie setting.  In all honesty, there's a couple moments that threw off the \"kids movie\" feeling, but I think by the end of the flick, that wasn't the issue. I laughed, I was visually entertained and I left feeling good that I didn't feel like I wasted my money.  I think that's what counts.  Worst comes to worst, at least rent it.

I know that the movie makers were trying to make this movie appealing to adults as well as children, and that's why a lot of the unnecessary stuff was placed in the movie. It would have just been better to keep the story as it was in the book and not make unnecessary changes. I am an adult, but I do not like to see this type of unnecessary crap in a movie for kids.

            "content": "Perhaps with 'Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat,' we can finally declare an official moratorium on any future live-action film adaptations of that beloved author's classic work. This is an even more egregious fiasco than the earlier 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas,' the film that stands, shockingly and inexplicably, as the box office champion of 2000. (Oh well, at least 'The Cat in the Hat' didn't emerge as the highest-grossing film of 2003. We should at least be grateful for small favors, I guess).Mike Myers embarrasses himself to no end playing the crazed feline who bursts into the lives of two bored youngsters one dull rainy afternoon. Myers' interpretation of the cat seems to derive its inspiration from the Charles Nelson Reilly school of lowbrow comedy. Though the film borrows the basic premise from the book, the screenplay and direction do everything possible to violate the spirit of the source, replacing the original's cleverness, subtlety and literary wit with manic pacing, unctuous caricatures, and foul, inappropriately sexual and scatological humor. The film's production design is indeed a wonder to behold, capturing the parti-colored splendor of the original book's illustrations to a tee. This is not, however, the case with the bizarre and repulsive suit the costume designers have fashioned for Meyers to inhabit. Indeed, the only thing saving Myers from total embarrassment here is the fact that the mask he's been forced to don at least hides his identity to some meager extent (poor Alec Baldwin, as a particularly obnoxious secondary character, is given no such protective covering to hide HIS understandably reddened face behind).Unlike the classic tale on which it is based, 'The Cat in the Hat' is a soulless, joyless enterprise that will depress generations of children to come as well as the bewildered adults who will be joining them in the experience. Really, who of any age wants to look at a cat's naked posterior or Baldwin's prosthetic beer belly, both of which are given ample and merciless display here? What a sad state Hollywood has come to when this is what movie moguls think passes for fine cinematic fun for the whole family.",

The two kids playing Conrad and Sally aren't very interesting and their actors give out every terrible performances (though this could be a case of misdirection). Mike Myers feels very miscast as the titular cat and his make-up doesn't help much in either the performance or acting shown in the movie. It also doesn't help that the other actors either ham it up too much or are rather dull.Even the sets (as accurate as they are) feel like something out of a theme park and the movie even has the nerve to basically do product placement for Universal Studios.Basically, what I'm trying to say is please.

She leaves Mrs. Kwan (Hill) to look after them while she is at work, and to make sure that they don't make a mess of the house. Mrs. Kwan then falls asleep and as it starts to rain Conrad an sally get very bored, but then they met the Cat (Myers).The Cat in the Hat to be precise, he is all about having fun ,and does his best to try and teach Conrad and Sally how to have fun, as Sally is a control freak and Conrad is a rule breaker, but while they mess up the house whilst trying to have some fun, and will Lawrence (Baldwin) find out about the Cat and finally get Conrad sent to military school? This is a great film, as it is full of adventure laughs and a bit of fantasy. This is also a good movie, for those who like Mike Myers as he does a good performance as The Cat and does his usual weird lines and faces in this movie. This movie is a bit peculiar, but then again so is the book. As an interpretation of the book, I don't think it did so well, I think this movie is maybe a little frightening for the age it is meant for, also the jokes are rather crude and not many young children would understand them. The affects in this more are rather poor, as they really don't look real. The Grinch Who Stole Christmas is a lot better than this movie. I wouldn't say this Movie is awful, if it was just a movie and not an interpretation of the book, then yes it is a good movie, but as it is a interpretation it is not so good and really does not do the book justice. All in all, this is a good movie, but it is not one of the greats and certainly doesn't live up to the book. I think that some children may enjoy it but other may not. It is not really for young children though, ages 7 and up I would suggest that may enjoy this movie.",

But this is based on a book, a short silly book, so it was o.k. that it was silly. That's what makes Dr. Seuss so charming. It's o.k. to be silly. How could it not be? A big cat dressed in a big hat comes to your house while you are(left at home alone in the book)cooped up in the house all day. The movie was not at all realistic,again how could it be? The sexual innuendos were subtle enough to go over my children's head, so there will be no permanent damage. I have not called to set up counseling sessions.

Even though there are many embarrassing \"jokes\" the film redeemed itself by keeping with Seuss's excellent political comments and morals. Anyone who knows anything about Seuss's work should know that all of his books/poems had an underlying meaning - they were all a sort of parable.\nThe Cat in the Hat is really all about Communism and Capitalism (represented very well by Sally in the film). The Cat is acting as the Anarchist to show the children that there is more to life than what they're living: \"it's fun to have fun but you have to know how\" - but is also warning them that anarchic fun can get them into a lot of trouble and lose them respect, but being too uptight can lose them friends. The fish represents dictatorship by trying to control and repress the children and the Cat but of course the Cat overthrows him, quite literally.The mother in the book is rather a passive figure, she leaves her children alone at home while she tries to earn a living, in fact if you look far enough into it there could be reason to believe that she is a prostitute because she runs out mysteriously leaving her two very young children alone. There is also a very stark absence of a father - there is no mention of one at all. I think in this respect the film did what it could with this strain of the storyline. We see the mother out earning a living because she is left alone with two kids to raise and actually taking the trouble to find a babysitter, even if she does sleep through the whole thing. There would have been global outrage if the filmmakers had stuck strictly to the original story in this case.I was glad to see the part about the pink spot in the film, for two reasons. First it cuts down the likelyhood of a sequel and second it referenced The Cat in the Hat Strikes Back. In the film the spots are more of a bright purple colour but the effect is still the same. This book showed the children alone once more, yet being subjected to almost child labour - they have to clear their front driveway of vast amounts of snow before their mother returns from her mysterious afternoon outings. However the Cat turns up again and creates havoc that will have to be cleared up - the relentless pink spot that bounces from one thing (including the mother's dress and something in the father's separate bedroom) to the next until it covers the whole of the white snow outside. With this simple plot device for teaching young kids the alphabet, Seuss was actually commenting on the 1950s social 'problem' of increasing homosexuality 'spreading' everywhere and how it was being shunned and repressed so ignorantly.I was also pleased with the amount of sexual promiscuity in the film (like the Cat's interest in Joan) as again it keeps in with Seuss's work. All in all I think this film did well to capture the Seussian world, particularly with the impressive opening credits and the iconic shot of Sally and Conrad staring gloomily out of the front window. But I did only give the film half marks because the script should have been more sophisticated than just resorting to cringe-worthy gags and a manic Mike Myers yelling \"oh yeah\" Austin Powers style through the whole film, but visually this movie was a treat.",

When I was about 7, this movie was popular out there and I remember one day I remember eating lunch with my friends when I was in the second grade and I open up my lunch and the face of the \"Cat And The Hat\" in this movie is on my Lunchable's box and I was so scared, I threw it away. I told my mom that \"I threw it away, It was so scary\" It scared me as a kid. I never went to see the movie when I was kid since I was so scared of it. LOL. A couple weeks ago, I watched this movie online somewhere and I just could not believe how disgusting, crude, abhorrent, obnoxious, dirty and grotesque this movie was. I am sickened that such a revolting film could ever be aimed towards children?!! How the hell is this movie aimed at children? You might as well expose children to pornography and to this movie, it is the same thing! Characters do disgusting things. Dogs urinate all over the place (Who wants to see that without puking?) The Cat shows his ass, literally, they pick their nose, burp, fart and they make innuendos towards swearwords, which is not appropriate and unacceptable for children to watch. There was one scene of Alec Baldwin in this movie living like a pig and in filth and it is just disgusting to show in a children's movie. This movie is dumb, stupid, obnoxious, crude, vulgar, sexually explicit, grotesque and just icky. It is one of the worst films I have ever seen. It is simply garbage and should have never have been made. Dr. Suess' books are made as kind, innocent and sweet and this movie turned \"The Cat And The Hat\" into a perverted, vulgar, filthy, disgusting, urinating, farting, belching, sickening, abhorrent individual. This movie is a piece of trash, the humor is garbage and disgusting and I hope to never see this film AGAIN! And I hope this vile, evil, miserable, icky piece of filth never sees the light of day again. If I could destroy every piece of this movie, I would so do it! The synopsis is, this movie deals with sex, violence and abhorrent subject matter in such a way it offends against the standards of morality, decency and propriety generally accepted by reasonable adults to the extent that it should have been classified or produced. I hate this piece of garbage movie so much that I just look at the reviews on this site and Rotten tomatoes.com of this film and just laugh and enjoy them because I love the fact that this movie was such a critical and box office failure.

The saddest part is, that was is funny is generally when \"The Cat\" is off the camera. I found Baldwin to be the most amusing role in the entire movie and that's simply not the way it should be. Is this a children's movie? Is it a comedy? Is it an adaptation of a book? What is it? Some of the jokes were so crude it made me uncomfortable to be in the theatre. Not because I can't handle crude humor but because this movie was aimed at little kids and was an adaptation of a kids' book! Bathroom humor, sexual innuendos, swearing (although indirectly) and the... the \"dirty hoe\" joke was just not okay. Not in anything associated with Dr. Seuss. Seriously, I wouldn't take small children to see this movie. I couldn't handle, \"Daddy, what's 'dirty hoe' mean?\"Bottom line, the movie can't figure out what it is. I enjoy children's movies when they remain children's movies. However, I was so dreadfully uncomfortable the whole time because of the humor that I couldn't get into \"children's story\" mode.

Instead, what we have here is nothing more than a typical Hollywood money-making machine that massacres the original story and turns it into a toned-down \"Austin Powers 4\", complete with sexual connotation jokes, eyebrow-raising situations and toilet humor. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Mike Myers and the \"Austin Powers\" trilogy. But at least those movies weren't deceiving in their content: we knew what to expect. But with \"The Cat In The Hat\", we basically get the same thing in the disguise of a \"children's movie\", only because the powers-that-be know that the masses will eat it all up and make their wallets even fatter. They have crapped on the genius of Dr. Seuss's work.

As a classic movie buff in my 20s, I usually avoid contemporary movies as I find them totally devoid of any charm, decency or subtlety - I thought I could not go wrong with a film based on a famous and beloved character, but I was in for a bitter disillusionment. Mike Mayers as the cat is irritating, one-notey and unappealing and spends the whole time giving a bad and incompetent imitation of Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion from The Wizard of Oz. There is not a single funny joke throughout and if the cat's ideas are supposed to be the answer of how to have a good time at home, it gives one quite a clue as to the screenwriters total lack of inspiration. Any 7 year old could have given them more original and fun ideas. The songs and musical numbers are an ordeal to sit through and the plot is non-existent, just a succession of distasteful situations and gross jokes seemingly put together just to fill up some time. You get the feeling you are watching a poorly extended short feature that was initially meant to last no more than 8 minutes. Any well brought up kid will be offended  by the bad substitutes for humor. And I doubt very much that the disgusting, moronic gags are any adult's idea of \"funny\". What a shame such potential was butchered like this. This is the first time I have ever written a negative review, but there is simply no redeeming grace in that one.

I'd love to know who thought that was a good team to adapt a Dr. Seuss novel, because even without knowing what the results were I think I could have predicted that train-wreck.In the first 20 minutes of the movie the Cat in the Hat not only insults the two kids, and slams the little boys face into a book, but he makes fun of him by calling him a bed wetter. I'm no expert, but as far as I know, a lot of kids wet the bed, and it's really inexcusable for a movie aimed at children to make fun of that.Almost all of the jokes are inappropriate for children in a similar way, like the one about circuses torturing elephants. Some people don't approve of circuses, especially animal acts, and I'm fine with that, but a children's movie like this should be full of wonderment and delight, not cynicism, cruelty and dream-crushing.I can only assume that Myers signed on to play the cat before there was a script.

It's a kids movie that's filled with seedy, inappropriate, garbage that needn't be put in a movie that's guaranteed to attract children. People also say that \"Kids won't get the jokes\".

(one of the Best in his field and always demanding perfection for his books) into a generic Writer and Illustrator.The Movie itself, is terrible. The Cat abandons rhyming in the first 5 minutes of his first appearance. The Cat himself, instead of being the Anarchic, but sweet, Merrymaker he was in the 1957 book, is now a Vulgar, jaded perversion of the original. Profanities are partially censored to dupe the Easily duped MPAA (Was the Hayes Office this gullible?).

NO! IF the TV Special was longer than 30 Minutes, Would Dr. Seuss Allow Chuck Jones, Hawley Pratt and Friz Freleng (Writer, Director, and Producer, respectivly) to include such horrible jokes? NO!

My kids said they didn't enjoy the film much because the Cat was too continually and overly silly.  For the same reason, I found myself painfully enduring the movie while wishing that it would hurry up and conclude. The only redeeming factor of the film was the two child actors.  They did an incredible job, despite all the annoyances they must have had to deal with. If it weren't for the outstanding acting of the two children, I would have given this movie a rating of only 1 instead of 2.If you want to see a Cat in the Hat that has both enjoyable music and humor, stick with the animated version.",

This movie will rightly take its place in the Parthenon of film greats, sitting proudly side by side the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Star Wars (the original 3), The Dark Knight and many others as a landmark in cinema. I'd even go as far as saying that it will sit at the forefront of all these movies.Mike Myers gives a performance for the ages, with an extraordinary depth of character surrounded by a philosophical yet entertaining aura throughout the entire movie. He completely submerges himself into the role of the Cat, and no actor will ever surpass the sublime performance of Myers as this character. The jokes are hilarious (dirty ho springs to mind)and well timed, with faultless CGI and ridiculous attention to detail put into every frame of the film. The screenplay and cinematography are both perfect, and (how many times will I have to use this phrase to describe aspects of this film?) cinema landmarks, elevating the whole plane of entertainment to a different level-they are that ground-breaking. I have never seen, and never will, a movie as well directed as Cat in the Hat. It is a scandal that Bo Welch was not recognized for his pioneering work. But this is not merely the most entertaining and hilarious movie in history. There are an infinite number of thought provoking and soul searching metaphors in this movie, my favourite in particular being the kitchen scene. This scene recognizes that the basic template of life is bland and boring, and that we must encourage our children and peers to innovate and push the boundaries of human knowledge-as demonstrated by the amazing Kupcake-inator. And oh my heavens. The soundtrack. Mozart is rolling in his grave, whilst John Williams, Hans Zimmer, Danny Elfman, Howard Shore and Co are cursing the combination of milk, honey and sugar that Danny Newman has brought to a grateful world's ears. To call it exemplary music would be doing it a disservice, and saying the beauty of angels is woven into every note a gross understatement.I cannot think of a single thing wrong with the Cat in the Hat and I must laud everyone involved in the production of this movie.

Most people feel obliged to view the movie adaptation of a book they've already read, but here, a piece of our collective childhood has been hijacked and transformed into a cash cow and a vehicle for the ego of Mr. Myers.This piece of cynical merchandising and it's ilk will go the same route as the 70's 'Disaster Movie'; an embarrassment to all concerned except the financiers and a sad footnote to the declining careers of once bankable actors.Theodor Seuss Geisel won't just be turning in his grave...

I actually walked out of the Cat in the Hat.  I stayed until just after `Thing One' and `Thing Two' started jumping around and joining the fun (and I use the word loosely).  I am not sure how I managed to stay for the first 30 or so minutes but what I saw made me want to run to the nearest showing of \"Glitter.\"  I was lucky enough to get a refund after leaving a quarter way through the movie but I cannot imagine the movie getting any better for the simple reason that there was no plot, not at all.  The Cat in the Hat is a great children's book, and so are all the other Dr Seuss books.  That does not mean they should all become feature films.  After \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" I was eagerly awaiting this film.  I thought it might be good.  Unlike the \"Grinch\" the writers of this movie were unable to expand upon Dr. Suess' story.  The movie seemed like an excuse for Mike Myers to have a lot of improv, who I have to agree with the critics seemed to be doing his best Austin Powers in a cat suit impression. Overall, I think the downfall of the \"Cat in the Hat\" was the fact that there was no story to base a plot on.  No amount of star power could save this story, not even Kelly Preston, not even Alec Baldwin, not even Dakota Fanning.  A dismal disappointment that I advise you to miss. I would rather count one fish, two fish until I was blue fish, and eat green eggs and ham than see the remaining antics of the \"Cat in the Hat.\"  Do yourself a favor and read Dr. Seuss' story instead of seeing this film.

He is a wonderful comedian on the TV show Will & Grace, and he was wonderful in this movie. I did note that Mike Myers used a couple of lines I had heard Sean use in Will & Grace. Mike Myers also did a very good job of acting, and, contrary to popular opinion, I did NOT feel that he was \"trying to act like Jim Carey\" in this movie.

I think time with your kids would be better spent reading the book and taking a walk in the park.It's so tempting to fall for the marketing - DON'T DO IT!",

            "content": "I just got home from seeing Cat in the Hat, and it was a very painful experience. None of the movie made any sense what so ever. First of all, the plot was terrible, but even that is understandable. But most importantly, the Cat (played terribly by Mike Myers), is a mix of weird Mike Myers characters from SNL etc. This may sound like a good thing, but trust me it is not. Every joke is based on potty humor that doesn't even seem appealing to a 3rd grader. The Cat is always plotting on killing everything. The only good thing about this movie is that the actual sets looked very much like a Dr. Seuss book, and similar to Edward Scissorhands. If you are a fan of Dr. Seuss do not see this movie, you will think, \"Why did they butcher this perfectly good book?\" And if you hate Dr. Seuss still don't see this movie because there is no humor in it whatsoever. Overall, unless you really want to stare at nice sets for an hour and a half, go rent a decent movie and save yourself some time, money, and a painful movie based very roughly on the book by Dr. Seuss.1/5 stars",

They love the cat-in-the-hat book, and we've read it more times than I can count. All of those books are very popular around this house. I also personally enjoy at least some of Mike Myer's work.  \"So I married an Axe Murderer\" is one of my all time favorite movies.  However, considering that it was a kids movie, a lot of that movie was out of line.  In a movie like Shrek you have a little more wiggle room with where you draw the line of appropriate.  The story is unique, and people expect that they aren't going to be sure of what's in it.  With Cat in the Hat there are certain expectations of decorum that I didn't feel were met.  There was a bit too much \"austin powers\" in Cat in the hat for my taste.Worse, the movie in general was very over the top.  They tried way too hard. Whole sections of the movie seemed to not flow very well.  The innuendo was unnecessary (though at least less blatant than grinch).\nDo yourself a favor and take your kids to see Elf this season instead. I'm so glad we had free tickets and only wound up paying 4$ to go.  Even at 4$ it seemed like a ripoff to me.  I hope this review saves some of you from wasting an hour or so of your life.",

I liked the cat, I liked the kids, I liked Larry, .... The rest is history; now it is one of my favorite movies.If you go into this movie expecting Suess's Cat in the Hat you'll be sorely disappointed; as you can verify by the movie's reviews. However! (as the cat says) give it some time then watch it again, and again and again. Now we laugh and copy the cat; many of his lines have become our household phrases such as \"I'm Sooooo Excited!\" and \"Anything? Anything! Anything? Anything!...\".The trouble with a movie review is that usually people write them after their first time seeing a movie; so only your first impression is taken. What if after seeing a movie 5 times you find that you really do like it but the review you wrote after seeing it once labeled it horrible? As a result, despite the reviews, I predict video sales for this movie will soar and nearly every kid on the block will have his or her own copy.Bravo to Mike Myers, the rest of the cast, the writers and producers.

He helped with the expanded version of his story, the songs, etc. Why couldn't this have been incorporated into the movie?The Cat in the Hat is not the same without \"he's a cat in a hat, he's a chat en le chapeau...\" and \"thing one and thing two, thing two and thing one, they can do anything, anything, anything under the sun...\"",

            "content": "I have to wonder why so many people are crying foul over the Mike Myers film, The Cat in the Hat. Is it really as horrifyingly bad as you claim it to be, or are you just mad that the filmmakers didn't create the perfect adaptation of your beloved storybook? I've read in a lot of reviews that much of the plot in the film wasn't in the original book. Well of course! How in the world did you expect Universal Studios to make a 90 minute movie out of a book with less than 20 pages? Let's just give them the benefit of the doubt and a break, okay? I liked the movie, despite its possibility of being forgetable in a few months, and I think that those who are saying it's the worst to come out of Hollywood in decades needs to take a chill pill. There are dozens of family films out there that are far worse than The Cat in the Hat: See Spot Run, anyone? Or how about any of the Pokemon movies? See, when you start comparing, this doesn't look so terrible now, does it? Granted, it's not perfect by any means. I thought the buildings screamed \"Film set,\" and tried a bit too hard to bring the story to life. People, there's a reason Dr. Seuss' illustrations look good on paper. Because in real life, they're grotesque and odd. Sorry, but the production aspect came off as fake, in my opinion. Also, the character Alec Baldwin portrayed was pretty much useless. I'm guessing the film needed a villain, but kids won't have any idea what he's doing here. Do you really think that kids under 13 or 14 are going to understand his plan of putting the kids in military school? Generally I find myself on the fence about most of the humor: While I thoroughly enjoyed Myer's jokes and one-liners, there is almost nothing here in the way of comedy that a younger kid would appreciate. Sure, the cat gets wacked in his twig and berries, but other than that I'm afraid kids will be bored. As for me, I dug Myers all the way. It's like they just put a camera in front of the comedian and said, \"Do your thing.\" Favorite lines: When he talks about murder and plays a dramatic chord on a Seussian keyboard, plucks his whiskers in order to add some suspensful music, and when we discover that he's been the narrator for the film the entire time. The fish was annoying, since he didn't get any good lines, and while the two main kids were okay they were nothing to write home about. And why oh why is TV's \"Beans\" in this movie? I can't stand that creepy little turd. He looks like a squirrel who's jammed one too many acorns into his puffy little mouth. Ugh, someone kick him out of show business! So all in all, while The Cat in the Hat may not be what everyone was hoping for, it satisfied my tastes. Not a classic, mind you, but certainly not the biggest bomb of the year as some have declared it to be. 2.5/4 stars; P.S. I think the film adaptation of Green Eggs and Ham should star David Spade as Sam and D.L. Hughley as the grumpy fellow who refuses to eat the title dish. And a special cameo could be made by Robin Williams as the Fox in Socks! Eew, that sounds horrible. Never mind.",

Don't get me wrong, it isn't good, but it isn't all-time level horrible.\nThe main problem with the Cat is the fact that the script writers forgot that Dr. Seuss works are supposed to be clever and harmless works for the whole family, family-oriented word-play and rhyming are important, no... mandatory in any rendition of a family classic like the Cat in the Hat. Unfortunately, the script writers felt compelled to ditch most of the rhyming and instead work in jokes about butt cracks, farting, belching, and hats as erections. Myers was ocassionally funny as the Cat, but his snarky, knowing attitude certainly missed the point of the Cat as originally written.Personally, the one time I actually chuckled out loud was when the baby-sitter commented on the Taiwanese Parliament CSPAN that she was making the children watch... and I ask you, \"has Seuss ever written about the Taiwanese Parliament\"?Movie Snob shakes his head and gives this film a 3.",

Since watching 'The Cat in the Hat' was so terrible, I will keep my comments to just a few.The character of the Cat was distinctly un-funny. Those who've seen 'The Grinch' and enjoyed Jim Carrey will be even more appalled at the dearth of energy and humor and the general listlessness of Meyers in this role (and I usually enjoy him). In fact, the entire movie never seemed to find a sense of energy (or humor). What potential there was evaporated upon the appearance of the Cat and never came back.I would advise parents to pre-view this movie before taking a young-one: there are instances of rather blatant sexual innuendo and verbal/situational violence apropos Austin Powers.

The jokes are too dirty for a movie of this nature, and it borders on cruelty more than humor. The cat himself is scary looking and it looks like a starker in some of the scenes. Yes, you can say that The Grinch was the same thing but at least it had some of what the cartoon had in spades, this movie has nothing but a crude joke in its core, and that is pretty scary considering that its aimed for kids.",

The movie does not flow well, but it is consistent. For example, the first few scenes after the cat shows up look like the producer tried to force them in there. When the cat does show up, he is not as alive as I figured he would be. While the book is passive as compared to a live actor playing the cat, I figured with Mike Myers playing the role, the cat would be jumping all over, constantly talking and making fun happen. Instead, I got the feeling that if I were Conrad or Sally I would be bored with the cat.At several points in the movie, a character will hint at a vulgar expression. For example: when the cat has a mishap with the knife, and when he talks about the name of his old car. If this were a movie aimed at a broad audience and maybe with a PG-13 rating I would think nothing of it, but this movie is PG and clearly aimed directly at small children. While there is no swearing, I feel the intent is clear and it is the thought that counts.Despite those comments, I still feel the movie is worth watching if only once. The costumes work well, special effects are good enough not to be noticeably bad, and the humor is good enough to get a laugh the first time through.While not part of the movie itself, the DVD is annoying.

The Cat And The Hat is supposed to be a kids movie and a Dr. Suess movie, but the makers of this film turned it into a vile, abhorrent piece of trash filled with vulgar gags that are unsuitable for children and I am sure not even funny to most adults. The acting wasn't great but it deteriorated once Mike Meyers showed up. God! I swear the make-up on him playing The Cat was downright ugly and disturbing.

Don't let your kids watch it and don't waste your time watching it, it isn't worth it.",

Probably you'll find they've done neither in a long time and are just acting like pseudo authorities.Look I know Geisel's wife didn't approve of this movie(she found it too racy) but consider this know it alls. This movie is really more like the book than Seuss's original T.V. cartoon special was. The original T.V. cartoon written by Seuss himself: (a)gave the fish a name (b)included a contraption called a 'Gre-dun-za' (c)did not include the subplot of the mother's dress The Mike Myer's movie included: (a)the subplot of the mother's dress (b)included the part where the kids chase the Things around with nets. (c)featured art work used at the beginning that looked liked Seuss's illustrations more than the DePatie-Freeling cartoon did.People should stop listening to the critical backlash that accompanied this film at the time of release by critics who hadn't opened up the book in a long time and who hadn't even made the comparisons with Seuss's original when they complained about faithfulness. This movie was much more in the spirit of Dr. Seuss's books then it's critic's want you to think. It's a much better adaptation than the 'Grinch' movie and feels less padded and fleshed out. Take it from someone who reads the book and watches the original Depatie-Freeling cartoon written by Giesel himself, every year, this is a really fun, cool and hilarious movie.

If you like toilet humor, then you might enjoy this like I did. But know that as an adaption it doesn't seem that good, I mean after all, the book was so short it was hard to imagine it becoming a full length feature film, so obviously, characters had to be added, and other more things had to happen. And honestly, I have to say that if the film wouldn't of had the toilet humor it would have a dull children's movie, don't get me wrong its meant for children but the idea of the humor was so that it would be enjoyed by both children and young adults or teenagers, it would be like watching a winnie the pooh movie, only kids will find it amusing and we will just be seating for an hour and a half trying to make the best of it.Don't be so hard on this film just cause you're not into the humor, the film is good fun for the whole family.",

My husband and I took our almost six-year-old granddaughter to see this new live action flick from Universal Pictures. I can't tell you who enjoyed it more \u0096 us or the kid! While our granddaughter smiled and recited the well-known lines from the book along with the on-screen narration, I was splitting my sides with the adult laughs. This movie is rated PG for `mild crude humor' but that didn't seem to bother anyone at the preview. 'The Cat in the Hat' is from the book of the same name. For most young readers, it's probably their favorite from Dr. Seuss. Add in a masterfully humorous screenplay by Alec Berg, glorious production design by Alex McDowell, magnificent set decoration by Anne Kuljian, fantastic costume design by Rita Ryack and the ultimate direction by former production designer Bo Welch \u0096 and the result is up to expectations. The special effects are phenomenal as is the cast. Top cat Mike Myers handles the title role and he is over-the-top hilarious in a fast moving whirlwind of action that will have you breathless.  There so much packed into this feature that you'll might feel the same way as our granddaughter, who said at the end, `Now I know what I'm going to do with the money I've been saving. I want to see it again and I'm going to buy the video when it comes out.'Alec Baldwin is memorable as the villainous Quinn. Handsome guy that he is, Alec has allowed himself to be shown as a super-slob complete with blubbery tummy.  At one point, he appears totally dipped in purple sticky goopy stuff. Kelly Preston, who is John Travolta's wife in real life, plays the sweet and shapely Mom.  The kids, Dakota Fanning as Sally and Spencer Breslin as Conrad, are fully up to the challenge of keeping up with the manic Myers.What an opportunity! It's a chance to savor and enjoy `Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat' in a whole newly embellished way. We loved it. You probably will, too.  Forget about the critics who don't like it --  they're just Grinches! Find a kid to take you or make up some other reason to go \u0096 but don't miss this feline fantasy.  I rate this an `A'!",

However, there are a few of them that are very well done, and this one is by far the best adaptation. Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect special effects, perfect sets/locations and a perfect soundtrack. The story may not follow the novel entirely, but the story adapted to the big screen is a lot of fun. It showcases a fresh look at the story of the most famous Dr. Seuss story, with many fun and humorous moments! The acting is stellar, Mike Myers is hilarious as the Cat, Spencer Breslin is funny as Conrad, Dakota Fanning has a dry sense of humor as Sally, Alec Baldwin is a great villain, etc. The rest of the side actors are brilliant as well, and all of their jokes and moments hit bullseye. All of the special effects in the movie are very well done and still hold up to this day. The sets/locations are very creative, and the exaggerated designs make the movie look like it was taken right out of a Dr. Seuss book! Finally, the soundtrack is stellar and it really sets the tone for the movie. David Newman definitely composed a phenomenal soundtrack and knocked it out of the park! Now, there are a lot of people who hate this movie, but I don't care. I love this movie! It may not appeal to everyone, but it's always so much fun to watch. I can watch this movie over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 stars. This movie is fantastic, and it's still timeless to this day. If you're ever looking for the best live-action adaptation of a Dr. Seuss book, then this movie is certainly worth a look.

There were many dirty jokes that I never even remembered when I was younger.This movie is one of those types of movies you bring your kids to so you can watch it without looking weird as a adult in a kids movie. I had some issues with this movie and at times it was immature, but then I remembered it was a kids movie and it had to be at times.The acting wasn't bad but it was the best.

But I guarantee you will catch yourself laughing at some of the jokes and references.All I'm saying is you can either find this movie as a hidden gem or a hot pile of garbage depending on who you are.

I look back and watch it again now, and the jokes are so bad, and the storyline is just like any other boring kids program, but that's part of what makes it such a fun and exciting film to watch. Some of the one- liner jokes are so bad, that they are funny. They actually make me laugh. As I'm coming to the end of my teenage years, I'm not a baby, but I'm still young. I'm still a child inside, and I still have an imagination that needs feeding. This is the kind of film that leaves me dreaming. I wish I had a better childhood and that something amazing happened, like a talking cat would come out of nowhere and allow me to have fun. I still wish that something like that would happen now. It would be so amazing to go on an adventure like that in my own house. Also the jokes, the acting, and pretty much the entire film is so cheesy and bad. It's something that I love to watch, and it's great if you don't want to hurt your brain by concentrating too hard. Another thing is, the graphics and special effects are pretty good!

This movie is an overnight cult classic - I say \"cult\" because most people probably have a few too many sensibilities against \"silliness\" to realize how utterly hilarious it is.The comedy is primarily satire, and it went over the heads of my 2 and 5 year old daughters - its aimed more at the 8+ child. But even for the tots, there is nothing subversive/violent/explicit that they will possibly be able to detect.One thing that no-one anywhere has mentioned is this movie's greatest strength. Yes, Bo Welch melded the scenery and costumes brilliantly and Mike Myers never misses a beat. But the reason this movie is brilliant is due to its PACING. The editor should receive an Oscar, and I say that sincerely.Dr Seuss forces you to read his books briskly - he makes you get caught up in his silliness and whimsical rhymes. Most people just fight against the text and read it slowly, thereby making the books devoid of life and zaniness. This movie captures the poetry and style of Seuss' timeless book in a way that is *supposed* to be impossible! The perfect pacing of the movie mirrors Seuss' works brilliantly - this movie is a unique and brilliant cinematic achievement.I'm shocked that so few appreciate it. Of course it has no plot - it's a whimsical journey of fantasy. If Seuss were to be judged on plot, all his books would be rubbish. But in fact, they are timeless classics, with a unique ability to show children the power of language to elevate and inspire you. I understand that people today have forgotten the power of poetry and rhythm, but are we also losing our ability to laugh at ourselves?",

If you experience it for the first time after you pass the age of 10 or something, of course it's easy for you to find it really annoying. The movie has a very unique way to tell everything and for that particular reason, I accept that it's not for all children, let alone every person. But to be honest, I didn't find the dark humor in it disturbing when I was a child in the first place. After watching it for the second time in college, the offensive things were more clear but still, it wasn't really disturbing.Other than all of that, the movie deserves more credit for what Mike Myers did with his role, if not anything. To be perfectly honest his performance is utterly underrated. He basically played a great version of the character in the book. I watched all the other movies that were inspired by Dr. Seuss books and I can't really say that they are 'that' better than this one. At least not a difference where this movie is the bottom 78th.Despite everything, the movie has a special place for me. It taught me to be responsible in a funny, interesting and exciting way. I mean, what else can I expect from a movie like this at the age of 7? Right, Cat?9/10. 1 point is missing for not being suitable for everyone.",

One that is a perfect example of amazing production design and true absurdist surrealism with a touch of psychosexual nihilism and black comedy. A true masterpiece, to say the least.

I viewed it as its own movie, individual from the original. The Cat has to be able to fit in with the world today, he needed to be changed.Secondly, I was able to shrug off the bad (slightly dirty) jokes, even though they did detract from the experience. The \"dirty hoe\" scene should have been cut, for a brief second, it kills the Seussy feel.Thirdly, I made sure to notice anything that did feel Seussy, such as the names of a lot of the characters (Humberfloob is a name nothing non-Seuss would ever get away with) and the look of the town, and enjoyed the personalities they had to give to the characters.All in all, I think if you try to appreciate The Cat in the Hat for what it is--very loosely based on the book, not totally--you'll enjoy it an awful lot more than you'd think. The dirty and just plain dumb jokes should have gone, but they're relatively few and far between. 8/10.",

Best of all though it manages to swerve the usual pitfall that most Disney live-action films fall into, which is to lose all the comedy at the end in favour of a sickly sweet resolution.

My thought is that they saw how good \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" (which, by the way, is a great film) was and decided to try another Dr. Seuss classic, probably the most classic there is: The Cat in the Hat. When I saw the trailers for this movie, I was very excited. I thought that this film would be a great one, considering no producers in their right minds would try to ruin a timeless story with fart jokes and potty language. But that's the thing. The producers probably weren't in their right minds. Along the line, here are all the mess-ups they made: 1. They cast Mike Myers as the Cat in the Hat. This probably didn't sound like a bad idea at first, what with casting a man of many voices as the lead. But the thing is he didn't use any new voices at all! I heard his regular voice and his Fat Bastard voice and that was it. Perhaps if he came up with some new voices that didn't sound canned, maybe I wouldn't have hated this movie so much.2. The REALLY bad, and sometimes inappropriate, jokes. THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A KIDS MOVIE!!! Okay, maybe a fart joke or two can be forgiven (nowadays, unfortunately, that's all little kids laugh at now. Thanks a lot Hollywood), but not only did it go from farts and toilets, but then it escalated to foul language. No, not words like \"poop\" and \"pee\", but \"sh*t\" and \"b*tch\" and \"a*s\". And they even sneaked in a pretend erection and Paris Hilton dancing like a slut (oh yeah, because little kids know all about sophisticated humor). Maybe they thought that they should make it a movie for adults too, considering they might be bored sitting through a kiddie movie for their children. But there's no in between. Either you have jokes for the kids and make it a kid movie or have jokes for the adults and make it an adult movie (which would've been a bad idea anyway). But if you clash the two together, you get a mob of angry parents and a bunch of confused kids wondering what S-H-*-T spelled and what it meant. And the worst part about this was that these were pretty much the only kind of jokes in the movie, aside from all the corny, straight-from-the-can, so-unfunny-you-wouldn't-even-know-that-they-were-jokes jokes and slapstick humor.3. Just even thinking about making the movie. If it's a classic, then maybe you should leave it alone. Because, chances are, the movie will end up ruining the story for generations to come, because whenever the story is being read from the book, the children stop to ask you \"why didn't the cat dance with Pairs Hilton like he did in the movie?\" I mean, even the producers of \"The Grinch\" were taking a VERY big risk in making that movie. They're lucky in making it a good movie. But this movie took the risk and failed miserably. Either the producers make audiences laugh or cry with a good movie or ruin the story with a bad one. One or the other. Those are the only pathways there are.The only good things about the movie were the okay acting from child actors Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning and the surprisingly-outstanding scenery. Other than that, stick with the book. Not only is it appropriate for the little ones, but it will touch the hearts of all ages. Because movies are like recipes; if you want to make it good, don't used canned products. Use original ingredients to wow the judges. If you see this movie on the rack at a rent-a-video store, skip to the next shelf and don't look back.",

Then there's the dialog and the action! I find it hilarious! I watch it over and over! I also like the subtle sexuality. Mom looks so hot, it's no wonder the Cat pops an instant boner when he sees her portrait, which he then turns into a centerfold and swipes right in front of her children.There are several other subtly sexual scenes, like the momentary clip of Paris Hilton dancing in a disco, and a closeup of mom's feet in high heels.This is such a visual, sensual, humorous and erotic feast, I was surprised to see it only has a three-star rating!

            "content": "After the box office success of the live action, \"The Grinch Who Stole Christmas,\" I suppose it was thought that more of Dr. Seuss' works could be mined for more $$$.  The Cat in the Hat is a good, simple children's book but very short.  The premise is too small and narrow for the scope of a feature length film.  What is worse is the casting of Michael Myers as the Cat.  There was a time when his comedy was fresh and funny but now it is stale and Myers uses the same schtick he's repeated many times in the Austin Powers' films and even reverts to the Coffee Tawk Linda Richman voice on several occassions.  The adult actors all look foolish even in doing broad comedy.  Amy Hill as the narcoleptic babysitter is reduced to a cheap sight gag and Alec Baldwin is a good sport.  If it wasn't for his moving performance in \"The Cooler\" I would have been concerned that his career has been reduced to this.  Kelly Preston just has to look pretty but doesn't have much else to do.  Sean Hayes has a couple of comic moments as the germophobe boss.  The problem is much of the story is carried by Myers mugging in a cat costume amidst very good Seussian set pieces and an irritating amount of CGI effects and the 2 child actors who give very good performances in the middle of all of this mess.  Containing it's share of bathroom humor, there is even a cameo by Paris Hilton dirty dancing in a little skirt.  (Wonder how much her paycheck was?)  Overall, the film whether you choose to look at it as children's film or otherwise, is a waste of time, money, talent and effort and totally lacks the spirit of its orginal source.  What's next?  A big screen version of \"Dick and Jane\" (see Dick run)?",

I really liked it and spent my time laughing heaps. Needs a certain brand of humour (not bad humour mind you- I don't watch anything dumped on telly :-)). The jokes will probably go over kids heads. Considering how wacky the books were I think that this does quite well. I haven't seen 'The Grinch' that's true but if that was considered to be fabulous then no doubt that would also have the outrageous element of the books in it.Mike Myers did a great job as did the two kids and Alec Baldwin. Kelly Preston was as usual which was great.

            "content": "#spoilers#When this movie opens the viewer is shown a town. Several questions occur thereafter. In this town, every house is exactly the same, and every house has the same car in front of the house. After seeing this I thought, \"Okay, so this is a uniform, dull town?\" Then, we see everyone in the town is smiling and waving and having a wonderful time, so then I thought, \"Oh so this is a happy, exciting town?\" The problem with this movie is that it doesn't evoke any mood. This isn't a town, it is merely a complicated set. I think many people were going to see this because they thought that it would be like \"The Grinch\" which, seriously come on people, was an excellent movie. The only way that this movie could in any way relate to the genius of \"The Grinch\" is because it was \"a crumb, that was even too small for a mouse.\" You see, Jim Carrey WAS the Grinch. Whoville WAS a living, breathing town, with people, and streets, and emotions. \"The Cat in the Hat\" had two sets: The small area with the houses, and the city streets. The only thing shown when the cat is driving his \"S.L.O.W.\" into town, is a ridiculously placed field of grass. Now I have nothing against Mike Myers. However, he just did not fit this character as Jim Carrey fit the Grinch. As I said earlier, Jim Carrey WAS the Grinch. Mike Myers was an actor in a cat suit. Another error with this movie is that it had no backstory, no foundation. Okay, why is there a talking cat that just appeared out of nowhere in these people's house? What exactly IS the portal to \"his world\"? This movie was like a nutshell with no nut inside. A rough outer egde with no real center. Also, this movie tries to create a villain, which I think was just an exscuse to bring a big star like Alec Baldwin into the film. The villain isn't villainous. This movie tries to create conflict, but the conflict is not conflicting. The jokes aren't funny, the dreary day isn't dreary, and the fun cat isn't fun. It is a good thing Dr. Suess is already dead, because this poor excuse for a movie would have killed him. At least I know that if one of MY books had turned into this piece of garbage I would jump off a cliff in a heartbeat. So, if you want to be bored, puzzled, and discontented, this is the movie for you!",

            "content": "Now, if I were really clever I'd write this review in rhyming couplets, like the great Dr Seuss himself. But as the screenplay writers for this movie decided, that would get very tedious, very quickly.And if you're a big fan of the original 1950s Dr Seuss, that's what's likely to happen anyway if you go to see The Cat in the Hat. (I think the Internet Movie Database has been hijacked by such people - resulting in an 2.9/10 score for the film.)What they don't like about it, I guess, is the fact that Mike Myers (also to be heard soon as the voice of Shrek)and the writers have taken the franchise and updated it for the 21st Century. This not happening would have been about as likely as Will & Grace being married and filmed in black-and-white with no mention of homosexuality.Speaking of W&G, the other big name in this movie is Sean Hayes, who reprises his Jack character from the sitcom to play obsessive-compulsive estate agency boss, Mr Humberfloob. He really enjoys himself and, given a lot more time on screen, would have given the comedy stylings of Myers a run for their money. In fact, as though the film-makers realised they were wasting him, he also gets to be the voice of a Jimeny Cricket-like talking fish.Humberfloob plays the boss of the lovely Kelly Preston, who is being pursued by slimy, two-faced Alec Baldwin who wants to con her into marriage and then stick her out-of-control mini-John Belushi son, Conrad, (Spencer Breslin) in to military school and secretly hates her control-freak Lisa Simpson daughter, Sally (Dakota Fanning).Both the kids are excellent. It's like they found Fanning (now 10) by going back in time and getting Drew Barrymore from ET. But eventually, the children are mostly reacting to the madcap antics of Myers, who is given full range for his impressions and mainly plays The Cat like a Jewish comedian with a lot of Fred Gwynne (the guy who was Herman Munster). But he has that kind-of subversive, mischievous Seuss quality and I thought his little helpers, Thing 1 and Thing 2, were pure '50s.Debut movie director Bo Welch (who was the production designer on films like Men in Black, Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice - there's an obvious allusion to this last one at the end of The Cat in the Hat) presumably worked closely with his art people to produce a Seuss-style cartoon-like American town, full of bold outlines and bright colours but packed with contemporary references (Sally uses a retro palm-pilot, for instance, and the kids' amazing babysitter, Mrs Kwan, falls asleep in front of the modern-day Taiwanese parliament on TV).This gives the writers great scope for loads of in-gags like The Cat saying: \"See how we managed to work an up-tempo song into the soundtrack? That's important.\" And at one point Myers satirises infomercials, doing his famous Cheshire accent, which, on this occasion, sounds just like Johnny Vegas. And, of course, the special effects are remarkable - often used just to back-up the jokes. Also, look out for Paris Hilton and a gag that also appears in Shrek 2.In fact, every line Myers has is a gag; some very clever, some knowing, some really stupid and cheesy (the ones I like the best) and some a little bit more grown-up than you might think, hence the PG rating.And that's why this film's detractors will say that Theodor Seuss Geisel (Dr Seuss) will be turning in his grave. But the reclusive legend (who died in 1991, aged 86) supposedly wrote The Cat in the Hat as a bet. and he once said: \"Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.\"7/10",

Conrad and Sally, the two kids, is darling to behold.And this film absolutely DELIVERS on special effects. It's a wild romp through a strange and amusing world as crazy and madcap as you can get.

            "content": "Let me tell you. When I saw the previews of \"The Cat in the Hat,\" I thought it was going to be a great movie. So, I tried to buy the video for weeks and I finally got it, but I was extremely dismayed at what they put in this movie. In my opinion, this was the WORST movie I have ever seen this year. This movie lacks a certain moral to the whole experience, like, what was the Cat's purpose of coming to the children's house? Was he trying to show them to have fun once in awhile, or, was he trying to show them how to work together? (Which that message was just thrown at the end of the movie). Since, the movie lacked a moral, the whole plot just got destroyed by the movie's constant crude humor and sexual jokes. I always thought that the Cat in the Hat's character was more sweeter than the Grinch, even though the Cat can be extremely mischievous at times. But the way Mike Myers played out the Cat in the Hat was extremely vulgar and not at all funny. I don't think that any children's book would contain such vulgarity as this movie did. I mean, even though \"Shrek\" had some adult humor, it was actually funny and has a positive message about being yourself, something this movie could not display. The only good things about this movie was the set designs are extremely true to the tone of the book and Dakota Fanning does a great job playing as Sally. Also, the movie's music is played by David Newman, which gives the movie a slightly sweet tone. But because the movie has too many crude remarks and a horrible script, this movie is a big flop!!! I don't blame Mike Myers or the other actors and actresses for the downfall of this movie, since they were only doing what they were being told, but I do blame the director Bo Welch and the writers for making this movie the worst of 2003. I suggested that unless you want your children to see a sweet film for children, try to avoid watching \"The Cat in the Hat.\"",

What's more, a couple of shots really startled me: Mike Meyers turning around to flash his fake buttocks or caressing his coconut bra as a Carmen Miranda. I certainly NEVER saw that coming! While it may be pretty cool that the film expands itself to the grown-up viewers, such crude humor is not really all THAT necessary, especially since the original book was created for CHILDREN! Wacky slapstick action is just enough, thank you...no need for sexual suggestions or anything sleazy like that. The Cat holding up the mom's photo like a centerfold is enough risqueness to be allowed into a kid's movie and it would probably have gone over the kids' heads anyway.

            "content": "It does not require a lot of work to realize that this film is not generally held in high regard, among both film-goers and critics alike (its metascore here on IMDB is 19/100). For some reason, however, this is one of my favourite films from my childhood (I know, shocking isn't it), and I would like to share this reason with you and try to understand why other reviewers hate it so much.I would like to begin by saying that I have never read a story by Dr Seuss, something I hope to amend very soon. A lot of reviewers have compared this film to the original story by this story, which may explain why they have criticized it so harshly. They say it doesn't capture the original's tone and spirit and is, therefore, meant only to capitalize on its name and popularity without any actual effort put into the film itself. I beg to differ for a number of reasons based on one fact, to what extent does an adaptation has to remain loyal to the original that inspired it? I would argue that an adaptation has no obligation to be loyal to the original and so any argument comparing the two should not be to the detriment of the adaptation. This is my first point. Some reviewers have also complained that it uses certain language which is not appropriate in a children's film or story, like \"Son-of-a-b**** (bleep)!\", \"That chaps my a** (bleep)!\" and \"Dirty hoe... I'm sorry, baby. I love you!\". Yet these words are bleeped out and in the case of the word 'hoe', which is not bleeped out, its meaning is certainly not implicit to a young viewer. This is not a reasonable argument for me, there were a lot of sexual innuendos in a lot of children's cartoons and TV series before and yet nobody bothered to complain. And anyway, let's be realistic, a child cannot understand these jokes in the first place.Mike Myers is phenomenal as The Cat, I always find him to be absolutely hilarious and he really does try in this. The part where the kid hits him with the bat in the party when he is disguised as the Pi\u00f1ata always has me in stitches. I also love all the puns, some of which are ingenious and which I only understood after multiple viewings. An example is: \"The Cat: (showing his car) Here she is, the Super Luxurious Omnidirectional Whatchamajigger, or S-L-O-W for short.Sally: S-L-O-W?The Cat: Yeah, S.L.O.W. It's better than the last thing we had: Super Hydraulic Instantaneous Transporter.Conrad: Oh, you mean...The Cat: No! Quick! To the S.L.O.W.!\"The rest of the cast is equally as passionate, including the magnificent Alec Baldwin as Mr Lawrence. I like the two kids as Conrad (Spencer Breslin) and Sally (Dakota Fanning) as well, one should keep in mind their age when criticizing their acting (a fact which 'The Nostalgia Critic' on Youtube, for instance, does not take into consideration). I like the visuals and the unique style of this film, something which has never been reciprocated in quite the same manner. So why all this bad criticism? Even if this adaptation has been compared to the original story by Dr Seuss it is, i have already argued, unfair to compare the two. And those so-called critics claiming that this film is profit-oriented should take a look at my face and tell me which film isn't. I am one of the few to proudly claim that I love this film. There.Don't pay attention to all these bad reviews, at least give a chance for yourself. You may argue that I'm blinded by nostalgia from my childhood but I'm never bored with this film ,even after multiple viewings. 'The Cat in the Hat' (2003) is as entertaining as it is stylistically unique, and is certainly worth a chance.",

Oh, the key elements are there - two children, a cat, a hat, a fish, Thing 1 and Thing 2...  But there is so much added, and much in the way of adult jokes, all passed out with a wink and a silly laugh, that little of what we know and love from Theodore Geisel's work remains.  In his constant mincing and wry laugh, Mike does not give a performance so much as a tribute to the late great Charles Nelson Reilly, and though we know that he is more than just Wayne or Austin Powers, his performance in The Cat in the Hat leads one to believe he's somehow less than he once was. If you have young children who enjoy the book, save $20 and sit at home, reading to them.  If, on the other hand, you are a hard-core Myers fan who just enjoys a good romp that happens to have some Seuss in it, this might be worth a rental - but not a full ticket for barely more than an hour of movie that has barely more than ten minutes of plot.",

The Cat roams rampant through the suburban home, pretty much doing what you and I and these two kids would LOVE to do but wouldn't dare--everything Mom and Dad tell you \"not to.\" In psychological terms, the Cat is fulfilling the deepest desires of the children--to be really, really BAD, but without any consequences whatsoever. It's alluring, giddy, intoxicating, and it's SCARY, too. Disorder, like a roller-coaster ride, runs frighteningly and ultimately, downhill. Just before the authoritarian ORDER figure Mom (much more symbolic of order than Dad--this IS the Fifties and you can bet she does all the housework) anyway, Mom's reappearance is imminent and the Cat uses an unlikely device to vacuum up the mess and restore all as it was--in essence reversing entropy. This is accomplished effortlessly and with no visible source of power. Here is a golden opportunity to discuss the Second Law of Thermodynamics* with your kids. A good exercise would be to try to calculate the energy that would have been required to run such a device. Question: would the device the Cat uses to clean the mess be able to run off a car battery, or would it require, oh, say, a fast breeder reactor the size of Yokohama? You do the math. This endurable children's classic is essential to teaching the young about responsibility, temptation, thermodynamics and chaos theory. You can't begin too early. ___________ *The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that \"in all energy exchanges, if no energy enters or leaves the system, the potential energy of the state will always be less than that of the initial state.\" This is also known as entropy--or disorder.",

            "content": "I think that The Cat in the Hat is an example of a film aging well. So many of the jokes and moments in the film which may have turned viewers in 2003 away are moments I love now. Mike Myers is not as limited by the character of the cat as many would say or think, as he's able to make the character his own. His performance doesn't make the film worse, in fact I would say it makes it better. His jokes are all delivered in such a perfect mannerism and makes sure the audience gets it. While this film does have some adult humour, it's balanced with jokes for children and bits that parents and children will love. An example which comes to mind is the cupcake-inator. This scene is honestly the peak of the film, with jokes for children and adults alike. The surreal and absurdist nature of this film is something which may have turned away viewers in 2003, but rewatching this film now you can't help but witness the sheer brilliance it contains. I believe this film to be the best Dr. Seuss film, with one of Mike Myers's best performances. Bo Welch deserves another chance as a film director, as I believe he's talented beyond compare.",

The sets are very well designed, and the humour, despite relying mostly on toilet humour and adult jokes that Dr. Seuss would have never approved, I find funny for some reason.One thing I don't like though, is the Things. They look like the result of a mutation with Marge Simpson and Alfred E. Neuman. It's a good example of why you shouldn't copy how characters look in a drawing and translate them to live action without redesigning them.All in all, it's an enjoyable film, and I recommend it if you want something to laugh at.

The Cat in the Hat is a children's classic.  It has been advertised on TV on commercial spots targeted at young kids, and it was the subject of Happy Meals and Burger King Kids Meals.  Even in the movie itself, everything is designed as a child's dreamworld.  So why the hell did they put all that adult schtick into this movie?  Who was that for?  It's not racy enough to be a rated R movie, and it has WAY too much inappropriate materials for young kids. It's not even the kind of stuff that will go over their heads.Even viewing that movie by myself as an adult, it wasn't that funny.\nI likened this movie to the Grinch remake starring Jim Carey.  That was a decent remake- not the best, but I certainly wouldn't have any objections to my kids seing it (aside from perhaps the grinch's face landing in that chick's boobies).  But this movie was altogether different, and somehow it got a PG rating.Even aside from that, the costume was horriffic.  The cat face was absolutely ugly.  Mike Meyers' acting was horrible, as was most of the other actors.  Basically, the movie was a total flop.

There's elements from both TCitH and \"TCitH...Comes Back\" books (although I suspect the screenwriters were holding back some of TCitHCB for a second movie, lots of Little Cat A, B & C bean-bag toys etc, kerching!)  But even adding together both books there's not enough story to justify a movie.  Like \"The Grinch\", the production values seemed fairly high - and maybe only a movie can muster those kind of resources - but I really felt that stretching this beyond a TV special is about 45 minutes too long.I'm already looking forward to the 180 minute director's cut of \"Green Eggs and Ham\"",

The two children were cute enough, but not really endearing in any way. I had two distinct thoughts while watching this movie. The first was, \"when can I leave?\" and the second more distressing one was \"wow. That was really inappropriate for this kind of movie. What were they thinking??\". I was completely appalled by some of the so called humor being aimed at my son. I was doubly appalled at the two blatant references to commercialism (the mini ads for Universal studios and the movie soundtrack). This movie had none of the child- like innocence and wonder it should have and could have had. Even the long awaited for 'moral of the story' was lost in the hoopla. It was just another excuse to sell crap to our children.Mike Myers, Brian Grazer and all the rest of them should be ashamed to have put out this piece of celluloid drivel, but They are probably already working on an equally stupid sequel.",

They were books first and movies later, not because their authors had died and the exclusive merchandising rights had expired, but because they needed to be made.You know where I'm going with this.

Where's the little kid wonder? What were they thinking?The movie isn't just bad, it's evil.

Many complain about the characters, however the only aspects of the entire film that ever bugged me (and believe me... almost everything in films bug me) would have to be the Things (dear God why wont they stop talking and moving?!?!?!) and Mrs. Kwan, who effectively angers me even when pretending to be asleepMike Meyers pulls out his classic moves from his SNL days, and throws in some of the strange expressions and mannerisms that have become like a second skin to him since The Spy Who Shagged Me. Although, I must admit, he manages to pull it off, for once. He managed to get quite a few laughs out of me, and I'm not ashamed to admit it, I didn't hate enjoying those partsAlec Baldwin adds a rather unneeded amount of nastiness to the film, although in the end it works well to establish him as the baddie for the film's young \"heroes\" to attempt to stop. There are many moments when a single line can make you laugh, and actually make up for a rather unimaginative or fruitless scene, in some bizarre wayThe children are well casted (and the beautiful Dakota Fanning manages to pull off a seemingly 2-dimensional character and make her seem somewhat human... although that may just be me) and play off well against Mike Meyer's often forced jokesThe oft complained about fish is actually quite well animated (smooth animations, and a particularly gorgeous sheen off of the skin give a weighted and textured feel to an otherwise very unrealistic character design) and his voice matches eerily well. He never reaches a level of annoyance high enough to be remotely noteworthy, and in the end just ends up serving as the butt of a few jokes and nothing moreThe musical number is VERY bad, but the bright side is that it's supposed to be. The children are noticeably annoyed by his song, however end up falling for his antics by the end... I was as wellBasically, this review is more or less a defense of the film. It was surprisingly well crafted, and doesn't, IMO, get the recognition it deserves for ending up being quite solid despite it's shoddy constructsPerhaps one needs the correct mindset or attitude to watch and enjoy this film to the degree I did, but I can't say I expected this film to be as good as it is.

I cannot believe that anyone who truly values and appreciates Dr. Seuss would dare give money to the makers of such garbage. I deeply love these stories, both in their original print and animated forms.\nYet, do people realize that the newest attempts at telling these tales is not a way of communicating a grand story to our youth, but is a sad exertion by hollywood bigwigs to make money by slapping any random comedic actor into a slot where he can crack a few poorly written jokes, while they get you in the seats by slapping a nostalgic title on it and feed you mindless regurgitation of a once great narration. If Mike Myers and Jim Carey want to be silly and random, as in these films, then they need to add creativity to the mix and generate a new character in which to act this out.\nBy defiling Dr. Seuss's work, of all people, they are sending a whole new generation of children into the world with that making up their view of the story. When they now read The Cat... they will naturally refer to this film, and incorporate all of the elements not Seussian into the story. The true Cat would NEVER have acted like Linda Richman. The true Grinch would NEVER have shaved the mayor's head and said \"somebody looks faaaaaabulooooooouuuuussss!\" What a pity that whom ever owns the rights to his stories are not protecting them better. But who cares about the estate and life works of some old dead geezer when one could line his or her own pockets.One last thing, as with Austin Powers, this film has been a prostitute to every product from burgers, to chips, to soap, to mail, to theme parks.

ALSO, I believe it is wrong to shelter your kids from what they will only learn in school through other kids anyway. Eh, however I do agree with some of you, there was one part in the movie that I was slightly bored by. It was the part when they walked into the house with the ultimate mess and it got all.. mushy and meaningful. They could've directed that better and made it more interesting.

I feel Mike Meyers was an excellent choice for the cat. I don't think Tim Allen would have been as funny at it. This is not bad! All critics know how to do is complain about modern action in movies such as this one b/c their OLD! I would recommend people stop listening to critics and press reviewers and go see the movie to form your own opinion! In some ways it did look like it was aiming towards audiences of all ages. I admit Alec Baldwin was too disgusting in this. Anyway I give this movie a 8.5 out of 10. I rate it so high b/c of the effort that was put into it on the special effects and the scenery. I'm sure Brian Grazer learned from his mistake with the crude content in CITH. So maybe in the sequel (Cat in the Hat Comes Back) they won't bother using crude content.",

Alec Baldwin was great, and Sean Hayes was perfect for Mr. Humberfloob.  I felt the dialogue was terrible and absolutely unnecessary to include such over-the-top adult humor.  I can count with one hand the occasions of out-loud laughter by anyone in the auditorium. My 4 year old said afterward that the cat was funny, but I didn't catch him laughing often as he did with Ice Age, and other quality family films.  Although a lot happened in 80 minutes, it felt painfully long.  All I could see in the Cat was mixtures of Mike Myers characters, mainly Austin Powers.  A huge let down after the Grinch.",

So, thanks to you Cat in the Hat, for making me lose all respect I've ever had for Mike Myers. This movie was painful to sit through. So, its about these two kids, and then a cat comes and does about 300 bad jokes, and then they clean up, and everyone lives happily ever after. This movie never had a chance to be good and adding in Mike Myers made it worse. I can usually watch bad movies, and enjoy them, and pick out th liittle good things that they have, but this movie... So I recommend that even if this movies on HBO and you have nothing else to watch, the please do not watch it. You will instantly despise Mike Myers, and nobody wants that.",

I don't think I can critique him fairly because he never stands out to me in anything - except Glengarry Glen Ross, of course. The only funny parts in this movie were Sean Hayes in the beginning.

The hours of enjoyment I had watching this full to the brim film proves this. The colours, the set, the props and the dumb plot. I also don't associate this with Dr. Seus's novel. Which I was also read to me as a child. The film is unapologetic in its ludicrousness. It's almost freeing in a way.\nPeople need to see things from a another point of a view sometimes.

They're not going to care about the Taiwanese Parliament or hepatitis. They likely didn't get the sexual swinger party reference in \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" (and let's be honest, you didn't either).\"But what would Seuss think?!\" the guy had a talent for satire and ridicule. In fact, his more famous works read by children had underlying adult themes. He even illustrated a pretty racist comic for Judge magazine. I think he could handle offensive humor.People who grew up with the movie can now appreciate it in a different light with our new taste for satire and dark comedy, and that's pretty groovy.Go ahead and show it to your kids.

The mentioning of hoes in the movie was WAY out of line for a film geared towards children.  The adult comedy was out of place, and not even funny, the Cats acting left much to be desired and was a million miles away from Jim Carey's rendition of the Grinch.  The only justice to the true storylines charm was the colorful set that accurately portrayed the innocence of childhood imagination.I give this film a MAJOR two thumbs down and recommend all parents to avoid it like the plague... our children have enough bad influences from school and television and now we are slapped in the face again on the big screen.Cat  ... you suck!

            "content": "Forever an all time favorite\nThe Cat in the Hat is a comical cinematic masterpiece. Bo Welch took a simple book and made it into its own bright lively world. The unique costumes, lighting, and filter used in this film, submerges you into the story. Mike Meyers one liners and jokes are forever quotable, and bring a smile to the faces of many. The cinematography of this film is astonishing for a children's movie. The low angle shots used to announce the dominance and relationship between characters is unexpected in a film such as this, yet it works so well. Every time viewed, I find something new to smile and laugh at. This is my favorite film of all time, 10/10.",

            "content": "It's been 19 years since the live action Cat in the Hat movie was released in 2003 and I really love this movie. No really. Yes I know it got bad reviews but it's still a really good movie to watch and it's entertaining and I still watch this all the time. Mike Myers is a cool Cat In The Hat, Dakota Fanning is a cute Sally, Spencer Breslin is a great Conrad. The whole cast in this movie is great. If this is not your favorite live action Dr. Seuss film that's fine. Because it's just another version. This was never meant to replace the TV special. The live action version is just a different take on. This one talks about the characters of Sally and Conrad that were in the TV special and book that go on the adventures with The Cat and do other things. Also in the end of the movie they did share the blame and they both learned a lesion and it is a good character development for Sally and Conrad. The TV special will always be a classic that would make people laugh. But the live action version also makes people laugh. Can we all just get along. I mean that is what enjoying movies is all about. Enjoying both of them in different ways. I think I know why a lot people don't like this movie because it's kind of ripping off a movie that Mike Myers has been into before this movie. Like the Austin Powers movie series and it can be very hard for the viewers to understand whats going on and remember every little thing that's happening in the movie. I wouldn't call this a bad movie as we later see. Even though it has some weird jokes along with some adult humor and not so good following of the source material it's not that bad. When you separate all of that and just treat this movie as a standalone feature it dose come out to be a fun Mike Myers flick with some nice visuals and a still somewhat decent story.Here are my thoughts and why the live action Cat In The Hat movie makes a good film to watch.1. It teaches you unemployment and if you don't pay for the stuff that you own then they get repossessed. Like Larry's TV for example.2. It teaches you how to get along with others.3. It teaches you teamwork. Like when Sally and Conrad shut the crate in The Mother of all Messes.4. It teaches Joan to pay attention to her son Conrad about Larry's dirty methods of sending away Conrad to Military School so he can marry Joan and move into her house.5. It teaches Conrad not to be a messy revel and Sally not being a bossy suck up.6. It teaches you not to mess up your house before a party or a event. Like Joan's Meet and Greet party.This is what I like about the movie because what makes it good are some life lessons that we learn in our everyday lives. Not only that in the behind the scenes Mike Myers said when he was a kid The Cat In The Hat was his favorite Dr. Seuss book because in the movie The Cat is a teacher and he is teaching Sally and Conrad not only to have fun but learn lessons along the way. Which is why this movie is not only fun and a good one to watch but it also teaches us life lessons in the movie when we get older and have jobs.Even though this live action Dr. Seuss movie is ripping off the Austin Powers movie series it's got a little twist to it.Also Alec Baldwin's performance as Larry Quinn is what made this movie for me. He really steals the show as the main antagonist who is a child hatting jellies lover of a signal Mom trying to marry Joan for her wealth and get rid of her son Conrad by sending him to Military School. Not only that he is also a Slob, a lier and a dog knaper. And of cores the coolest villain defeat of what Larry got deserved in movie history. Larry got covered in purple slime in the end of the movie. Such a great thing they did.But over all I think this a good film because when I was a kid the live action Grinch movie was my first live action Dr. Seuss movie that I saw on DVD and the live action Cat in the Hat movie was my second and I grew up with this movie and I have a different opinion it and both of theses live action Dr. Seuss movies are both entertaining and funny.Plus it's another live action Dr. Seuss adaptation that's a classic.I hope Universal Pictures will do a live action sequel based off the original sequel The Cat In The Hat Comes Back someday in the future. Since Audrey Geisel died in 2018 there is still hope for a live action sequel. I got an idea for The Cat In The Hat Comes Back live action remake. How about they would make it like Mary Poppins Returns but with a little twist to it. Because the two child stars Dakota Fanning and Spencer Breslin who played Sally and Conrad who are now in their 20s and 30s and Kelly Preston who played their Mom died in 2020. Alec Baldwin who played Larry is still alive and Mike Myers who played The Cat In The Hat is still alive too. So maybe Larry will come back to the Walden house to get his revenge on Sally and Conrad where Conrad is now married with kids of his own and Sally became an Aunt to Conrad's kids and The Cat will come back to help the family. By the way, I think I know why Audrey Geisel forbidden any future live action movies on Ted's work because in the live action Cat In The Hat movie with all of the adult humor and the rip off the Austin Powers movie series. You can tell that they are running out of ideas for future live action Dr. Seuss adaptations. The Live Action Cat In The Hat movie was a good way to end the live action Dr. Seuss adaptations. Or is it? But who knows when they are going to do another live action Dr. Seuss adaptation. When The Cat In The Hat Comes Back Live Action Remake dose come down the line in the movie making business I bet they will bring back the 2003 cast and do a better job than they did with the first movie. It's been a very long time since the 2003 movie was released and it's about time they would do a sequel. When the live action Cat In The Hat movie get's it's 20th anniversary in 2023 then The Cat In The Hat Comes Back Live Action Remake will happen.",

The producers didn't bring in Mike Myers to play it subtlety, but rather to dazzle, which I believe was just not pulled off.  My expectations, as many others, were left in the theaters unfulfilled.  In my opinion, don't mess with success.  All I can say is how nice it would have been to see them stick with the same great duo of Jim Carrey and Ron Howard. At least the kids seemed to enjoy it...",

The story was awful, and the by-line should read Austin Power stars as the Cat in the Hat, rather than Mike Myers.The too thinly veiled sexual innuendos were so out of place in a Suess story, it was absurd.  Not appropriate for children.  The innuendos of curse words was definitely going too far, virtually all kids now days will get it. What happened to protecting childrens' innocence?Not a large audience at this afternoon's showing, but around 40 or so. Probably split 50/50 adults and children.  There were no laughs.  A few muffled chuckles, but that's it.  And those became fewer and fewer as the movie went on.  I was thoroughly board.Nothing in this movie worked.  The adult humor wasn't amusing the adults, and the kids were laughing at anything either.  The preview for the new Cody Banks movie received far more laughs from the kids than the entire Cat in the Hat movie did.For a more exciting evening or afternoon, I'd recommend watching paint dry.

It has been over 10 years since this movie came out and I am writing this review because my kids and I are still quoting lines out of this movie to this day, I've watched countless children's movies with my kids over two decades and this movie stands the test of time.... \"I'm so excited!\"... \"You're Firrrrrre...da!\" \"Oh Yeah!\"... the quotes go on.
