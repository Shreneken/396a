Plenty of wacky humour to ease the swelling if this isn't your thing and choc full of everything else you would expect form a piece of cinema from India, all those things that make it so special.",

            "content": "Storyline: Munna Bhai (Sanjay Dutt) and his gang are the typical 'Bhai's in Mumbai who claims to be a social worker helping out people in recovery (through kidnapping, haath-pair todna) etc and has lied to his father that he is a doctor. When the truth is discovered, an insulted Munna then makes a resolve to become a doctor. Coincidentally, he joins the same college where his enemy Dr. Asthana (Boman Irani) is a strict Dean. A comedy of troubles starts when the 'cool' don confronts strict Asthana.Comment: Although the story is quite similar to Hollywood's 'Patch Adams', the movie can make u laugh non-stop except for some serious scenes that are very few in that movie. The tapori style of Sanjay Dutt and Arshad Warsi is just too good. Sunil Dutt has acted after a really really long time of 17 years. Gracy Singh is graceful and sweet. Boman Irani has done a good job as a Strict Dean of the medical college who accidentally believes in Laughter therapy. Although the punchline of the movie says \"He might just cure you\", forget about the curing, he will surely make you laugh!! Truly Amazing Humour!! Rating: 4/5",

            "review_title": "The introduction to Munnabhai and Circuit",
            "content": "Inspired by the Hollywood movie 'Patch Adam', 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.' tells the comedic story of a thug who wants to become a doctor. The film has its major share of comedic moments and its dramatic moments. It is indeed an entertaining film with the famously lovable characters like Munnabhai and Circuit. Rajkumar Hirani may have taken the idea of an older outsider wanting to become a doctor from 'Patch Adams' but in essence 'Munnabhai M.B.B.S.' is its own film and it is the performances and comedy that make it worth the watch because most the dramatic moments are a little over the top. While the dialogue in the comedic scenes are witty and hilarious, the ones in the dramatic scenes are a mess.Sanjay Dutt totally nails Munnabhai. It's hard to picture anyone else in the title role. The actor does full justice. It was nice to see Sunil Dutt after a long time and that too as father to his own son. The actor has a strong presence, even in a brief role. Gracy Singh is cute and adorable. Jimmy Shergill is awesome and holds his own as Zaheer and Boman Irani too does very well. However, it is Arshad Warsi who steals the show in a breakthrough performance as one of the most memorable film characters of recent time, Circuit.Most of the songs are well balanced and are good additions to the film. I found Munnabhai's romantic ballad hilarious when he tries to convince the suicider to cut the crap. On the technical side, it's alright. On the whole this is one enjoyable flick. One would have expected more from the second Munnabhai film which I found boring but why should that prevent the pleasure that comes from this movie?",

            "content": "I saw Munnabhai MBBS primarily because of Sunjay Dutt. He has always been good in comedy, and his movies make you laugh without having to take help of double meaning dialogues or crossing the line into bitchiness. Ofcourse, Sunjay Dutt has to have a gangster connection, only then the movie can sell. He is the eternal gangster and those roles fit him well, no body can deny that. But where you really have to give director the full points is that he saw the comedic talents of the junior Dutt and put them into a simplistic, well made movie. All the characters, be it \"Circuit\" (Arshad Warsi) or the \"Dean\", or  Sunil Dutt, have been portrayed well enough in the movie. Some of the scenes, like the one where Sanjay Dutt \"rags\" the seniors make you laugh out from the heart, because this is something which every fresher in the college dreams of. I think, the movie deserves full points for direction, story, acting, nice title.... This movie was a real treat to watch when most of the other Hindi movies (especially the over-hyped stuff) turn out to be below average.10 out of 10.",

Sanjay Dutt gives another mind-blowing performance.Rajkumar Hirani is the new kid on the Block, but it doesn't show, one of would think he's a veteran filmmaker by the way he has directed his debut venture. Vidhu Vinod Chopra is not know for producing comedies, but his risk has paid off BIG TIME!!! The film also stars Sunil Dutt, after a very long gap, but he does full justice to his role, he's in full form and doesn't miss a single beat. Rohini Hattangadi is excellent. Arshad Warsi and Boman Irani simply steal the show. Gracy Singh is Sweet, Sensitive and spellbinding. Jimmy Shergill is excellent in a role that seems tailor made for him.Abbas Tyrewalla's Dialogues are superb and are the soul of the film. A definite must see!!!",

            "content": "With a poll coming up on IMDb's Classic Film board for the best titles of 2003,I started searching around for Bollywood movies that I could watch for the poll.Taking a look at the top grossing Bollywood films for 2003,I was delighted to spot a flick which I had seen the first half of at a friends house a few years ago,which led to me quickly booking an appointment with Dr.Munna Bhai.The plot:Finding out that his mum and dad are coming down to pay him an early visit,underworld gangster Munna Bhai orders his gang to completely change the appearance of his mansion,in order to keep his underworld life hidden from his parents.With no time to spare,Munna Bhai and his fellow friend/gangster decide to pretend to be dr's,so that Bhai's family can be happy at him having a 'traditional' job.Keeping everything under wraps,Bhai is caught by surprise,when his mum and dad reveal that they are going to arrange for him to get married to a former school friend of his nicknamed 'Chinki.'Keeping his underworld links under wraps,Bhai's parents run into the head doctor (Dr.J.C. Asthana) of a leading medical university.Talking about how proud they are of their son,Asthana destroys any sense of pride that Bhai's family have,by revealing that Bhail is actually a major gangster.Sickened by the sadness that his parents feel,Bhai decides that the only way he can bring happiness back to his parent's lives is to enter medical school with his gangster buddies by his side.View on the film:Running at 2 and a half hours,the screenplay by co-writer/ (along with Lajan Joseph,Vidhu Vinod Chopra and Abbas Tyrewala)editor/director Rajkumar Hirani moves at a lightning fast pace,with the writers jam packing the movie with hilariously sharp one dialogue and quick-paced slap-stick which is smartly always rooted to the characters current situations which helps the jokes to never feel disconnected from the drama taking place.Making sure to never become sickly sweet,and backed by a wonderful score from Anu Malik, (with almost all of the songs thankfully being subtitled)the writers wisely use the running time to gradually give the film a real heart,as Munna Bhai discovers the skills that he used to keep his gang together,can be put to better use for people who are in desperate need.Returning to the screen for the first time in 16 years,Sunil Dutt gives a very good performance as Munna Bhai's dad,with Dutt showing a real sorrow towards his real life son,as he discovers the lies that he has been told.Meeting up with his dad on screen,Sanjay Dutt gives an excellent performance as Munna Bhai,with Dutt delivering each one liner with a real relish,whilst also making sure that the comedy moments never get away from Bhai's aim of making his mum and dad proud.Despite there being a 20 year gap,Gracy Singh gives a charming performance as 'Chinki',with Singh showing a real sincerity as Chinki finds herself being taken by Bhai's charms,whilst Arshad Warsi shows a real comedic bite as Bhai's loyal sidekick Circuit,and Boman Irani (covered in expertly done make up effects) gives a tremendously ruthless performance,as the Dr who is determined to make Munna Bhai fail at the school.",

That scene is hilarious.But once Sunil Dutt finds out the reality, he is heart-broken and leaves. So now Sanjay Dutt has a point to prove and gets an admission to become a doctor. He doesn't get along well with the dean of the college. He is also in love with his daughter (Gracy Singh). The story now focuses on how people in the hospital need to be loved and appreciated. Arshad Warsi provides humour after every few scenes. Songs weren't that great except I really liked the \"Subah Ho Gayi Mamu\".Sanjay Dutt does justification to his role as the Bhai. Arshad Warsi in the supporting role has acted very well. His role in this reminded me a movie he had done earlier - Tere Mere Sapne.",

The night next to its release, there was a party in Mumbai having guests like Nasiruddin Shah and Om Puri! Mr. Shah stated \"This movie will go ahead of Vaastav.\" I was surprised like hell! Vaastav!!! Went to theatre the same week and watched it. GREAT MOVIE! I can't mention a point against it. Everything was simply superb. If we talk about acting!

What a hilarious idea!! There is superb acting by the main characters Sanjay Dutt, Boman Irani, Gracy Singh as well as almost all the supporting cast. Arshad Warsi is outstanding as the don's right hand. The substitute doctor acted well, too. Some of the melodrama (the guy with cancer, his family, etc) could have been cut in the editing room, but doesn't affect the pace much. It does have a few dance numbers, but nothing out of place or forced.Vidhu Vinod Chopra is making a name for himself taking calculated risks with new directors (Hirani, Sarkar of Parineeta) and new talent. Great to see someone in Bollywood sticking their neck out to make something at least plausibly entertaining, not the usual romantic nonsense.",

            "content": "They say laughter is the best medicine, so here comes Dr. Murli Prasad Sharma to cure you. He may not be the brightest, he may not be the most polite, hell, he may not even be an actual doctor but he will put a smile on your face and make you forget all your problems. So if you haven't seen the tactics of Munnabhai, then forget your problems for 2 and half hours and treat yourself to his funny and endearing classic.Murli Prasad Sharma, aka Munnabhai is a gangster who claims to be a social worker. He ran away from his village years ago to make a life in Mumbai. However, he ended up becoming a goon who lives with the a lie he told his parents. He's a doctor. So once every year, Munna's parents come to see their \"doctor\" son and his clinic full of small time cons who pose as other doctors/patient. One circumstance leads to another and Munna's parents come to find out his real identify due to Dr. Asthana. A shattered and disappointed father, Hari Prasad Sharma leaves Munnaa in anger.A Munna full of shame is now destined to become a real doctor and so begins a tale of laughter, emotions and important lessons in life.When i initially saw the promos of this movie, I wasn't really interested. I was more interested in watching a star studded dud named L.O.C. Kargil which came the same month. I expected Munnabhi MBBS to be a slapstick comedy with no logic whatsoever.Firstly, there is no silly comedy in this movie. The lines are fresh, some are make your chuckle and some turn you in tears. The situations are fresh and nothing is forced. The very first scenes catch your eye and put a smile on your face.Sanju kidnapping the man in the first scene, Sunil Dutt scene at the railway station, the act put up by Sanju in front of his parents. You're just 15 minutes into the film and you're laughing out loud. The sequences in the hospital only get funnier.The film is a comedy but does not shy of trying to touch your emotions and it succeeds big time. Sunil Dutt confronting his son is heartbreaking to watch. Sanju's scenes with Jimmy Shergill is brilliant.The music is situational so it isn't conventional in any way. Although, the songs are different, they're good for the most part. The title song, Dekh Le, Chan Chan etc all go well with the screenplay and are soothing to the ears. There may not be a chartbuster in the soundtrack but the songs are still good.The writing is just brilliant. No loop-holes in the script. No dip in the screenplay. Characters are fully developed. Raju Hirani's story is fresh.Another highpoint - Abbas Tyrewala's dialogues. Just outrageous. They are funny, and not a bit over the top. The emotion filled dialogues are perfect too.Gracy Singh, Jimmy Shergill, Krush Debo etc all lend great support. It was a pleasure watching Sunil Dutt with Sanju.Baman Irani is a great talent and I'm sure he would agree with me that this movie boosted his acting career. He's hilarious. A brilliant act! Murli Prasad Sharma would not be what he is without his side-kick Circuit, played by Arshad Warsi. Arshad is a scene stealer. His best act yet. This role was a turning point for Arshad.Now to Sanjay Dutt. Before Munnabhia, Sanju was doing mediocre movies and mediocre roles. He hadn't give a box office hit in ages. Munnabhi MBBS is Sanjay Dutt's role. He was born to play the character and nobody can do it better than him. Not SRK, not Aamir - NOBODY! Although these people mentioned above are a huge part of the movie, none of them deserve more credit than the real hero of this masterpiece.Before naming him, I'd like to thank Vidhu Vinod Chopra for finding this guy. Yes, I'm talking about Indian cinema's current best filmmaker - Raj Kumar Hirani.This is Raju's film and no one can deny it. A perfectly directed movie and a novel idea. Hats off to this guy, who gave 2 more classics after this movie. (Lage Raho Munnabhai & 3 Idiots) What is there left to say? Just watch it, enjoy it, and watch it again. (I know you will!)",

Now we have his prodigal son Sanjay Dutt who has a physique for a gangster and a facade that is as vacant as his father which makes him perfect for a comic role (The Burt Reynolds of Bollwood). He is a disaster in romantic movies and many may feel the same way too. He is very adept at playing the intensity of a gangster as in \"Plan\" or a gangster/fake Doctor as he does here.As Munnabhai he fills the coat to the fullest with his talent. The story is poignant and moralistic where the audience comes out with a message instead of glossy eyed teeny- boppers watching the recent string of bubble gum movies like KKHH, DDLJ, KHNH, most of them starring mediocre actors albeit saved by catchy music. Talent will shine no matter what-Gracy Singh is an example of that premise, this is an actress who has the elegance of the yesteryear Stars like Vijayantimala and talent go with it, and she has only one place to go-that is the top.Boman Irani is just is just superb.

When his parents visit, he turns his compound into a fake hospital and pretends to be the head doctor. His father is an honorable man from the country who treats even a pickpocket with kindness. His father runs into old acquaintance Dr. Asthana who once upon a time treated their village. The parents decide to bring together Munna with Asthana's daughter Chinki who is also a doctor. Asthana outs Munna's deception and his father is humiliated. Munna decides to go to medical school for real where he is met by the disbelieving dean Dr. Asthana and Chinki although unknowingly by her real name Dr. Suman.This is funny. It's got heart. It's Bollywood. Early on, it demonstrates both comedy and tragedy. When the mother asks Munna if he's actually a doctor, my heart almost broke. The emotional scene is devastating. Then the movie turns into Patch Adams goes to Medical School. I do have issues with some of his actions although leeway must be given since his character is a goon. Comedy in a foreign language can often be problematic. About half is lost in translation but the general sense of humor is never lost. One problem does stick. There's no denying the two decade age difference between Sanjay Dutt and Gracy Singh. Older men and younger women have been staples in cinema forever and I'm not objecting to that. It's a matter of logic since Munna and Chinki are supposed to be childhood friends who played doctor together. Either lose that past history or get an older actress. It doesn't make sense.

            "content": "There were a couple of great takeaways I got from this film. The first was a description of Munna Bhai's (Sanjay Dutt) real profession as a gangster - that of a 'loan default prevention specialist'. I think the Mafia could learn something about softening their strong arm approach by using a term like that. The other idea that came across rather successfully was the concept of a Magic Hug. That was reinforced a few times throughout the story for a positive effect. Other reviewers here on IMDb mention the American film \"Patch Adams\" as the basis for the story line in this picture, but not having seen it, the thought that came to my mind was another Hindi film, \" 3 Idiots\". In that picture, the message that came across was about believing in one's self and doing what you really want to do with your life. In this one, Murli Prasad 'Munna Bhai' Sharma is shamed by his past and decides to make his family proud by becoming a doctor instead of pretending to be one. Additionally, as regards \"3Idiots\", there's also the conflicted relationship between Murli and the dean of his medical colllege, who's daughter serves as a romantic interest for the ex-gangster.The film's best moments appear whenever Murli's unorthodox, humanistic and compassionate side reveals itself, as in his treatment of the near comatose wheelchair patient Anand (Yatin Karyekar). His ability to make friends with everyone he comes in contact with serves him well when the Dean attempts to formally rusticate him from medical school. You know there was only one way for this story to end, and it does, with plenty of magic hugs to go around.",

We have a very unpleasant main character, silly goings on with totally unbelievable gangsters, sloppy acting, unnecessary songs and dance acts, sentimentality, and so on.

            "content": "\"Munna Bhai M. B. B. S.\" (2003) is a 2003 Indian Hindi-language comedy-drama film written and directed by Rajkumar Hirani.Honestly, this seems like a strange film like so many other Bollywood films, it is a mess, both in terms of writing, direction and editing. Meanwhile, the lead performances by Sanjay Dutt, Gracy Singh, Arshad Warsi, and Boman Irani, among others, are all way over the top. This is quite understandable, since they all had very little to work with in terms of screenwriting qualia.As I've noted before in my reviews of Bollywood films, it is high time for IMDb to improve their rating algorithm and start to take into account demographic diversity (or lack thereof), which badly skews the average ratings of films. I find this to be a very prevalent issue particularly surrounding Bollywood cinema and their loyal domestic voters.\"Munna Bhai M. B. B. S.\" is not as horrible as the mentions below, but mediocre at the very best for anyone from outside Eastern film tradition. Like many others from this region, this is a quite odd film, and ironically part of the infamous IMDb top 250, due to the violent skew imposed by user ratings from lovers of these atrocious - to mediocre at best - Bollywood oddities.Other examples include so-called \"films\" such as \"Andhadhun\", \"Drishyam\", and \"Airlift\", all of which are provocatively bad by Western standards. Not only are they without substance or morale and formed through hideous scripts, they lack humanity, and by this I mean in a dualistic sense, as neither good or bad are portrayed anything vaguely close to authentic.Not recommended for Western audiences.",

There was no other major star in it.\nEven the antagonist was a relatively unknown guy called Boman Irani who had a Theater background and had never done any films professionally before.\nThe film is so well written and so nicely executed that it makes you wonder how can the director be so great with details and humor.\nThe timing of actors is just perfect and everyone is given the perfect dialogues and screen space.\nWhether it be the secondary characters or main lead, everyone made their presence felt in the film.\nThe direction of Hirani is perfect and everything else is also perfect knowing that the film was made by a perfect guy who plans his films a lot in details.\nIn my opinion it is one the greatest films ever made in Indian cinema and stands tall along with Mother India, Sholay and Mughle Azam.\nSome people do compare it with \"Patch Adams\" and say Hirani copied it from there.\nHirani has categorically denied it but again, I say, even if he has done something like that, this film is far better and more entertaining that \"Patch Adams\" and more than that - I don't care.\nThe film is damn good.",

Munna is a big deal in the Mumbay crime business, but to his family he likes to pretend to be a doctor. Until the truth gets revealed, at which point he vows to actually go through medical school. Whatever it takes.The film thrives because of its tone. Dutt's Munna Bhai is a free spirit, a rebel without a cause, who nevertheless has a heart of gold and simply wants to make people closest to him happy. Very much a lovable rogue, akin to Han Solo or Robin Hood. Technically a criminal, but you nevertheless side with him one hundred percent. And because he's pitted against India's draconian medical practices, it works.I also like the fact that the various musical numbers, which are pretty much compulsory for these films, actually benefit the plot. They move it along, they introduce characters, they deepen the themes. In a nutshell, they're necessary for the story, which is a rare treat in these film.If I wanted to nitpick something, I'd say that the age gap between Munna and his love interest, played by Gracy Singh, is a bit much. Then again, it's not like there are no Hollywood films, especially from the earlier part of 20th century, that don't have similar problems.Very good, very funny film.

Surprise perdoemance by Boiman Irani who earlier worked in three films `Everybody Says I Am Fine', `Let's Talk' and `Darna Mana Hai' and one wonders that where this talented person was before and where he was hiding and why no one noticed him before. `Aik Jhohri Hi Heere Ki Parakh Kar Sakta Hain' and that Jhohri is none other than RajKumar Hirani who has done a Fabulous Job. And the Credit goes to the Technical WhizKid Vidhu Vinod Chopra who has played the role of a Producer in this movie and didn't interfered in the making of this movie and gave a free hand to his director to work.

I never understood what all the fuss was about, until I saw it myself. As a kid there were a lot of things that I didn't understand from this movie, like why is a Principal doing operation, why they catch a man and make him give the test and what the entire arc about the disabled man was. So when I watched this film when I grew up, I could finally understand it completely.From what I understand about this film, every parent wants their child to be successful, and if possible it should be in a renowned field like a doctor or an army general. No one wants their children to become street goons. And here Munna had run away from his village and become a hooligan. Now of course if his parents asked what he did in Mumbai, he couldn't tell them the truth, and so he chose to lie to them about being a doctor.Now, doctors work really hard to get to their field. And if an egoistic doctor hears a street goon calling himself a doctor, obviously he won't be able to tolerate it, especially if it's someone who troubled him a lot as a kid. So he takes advantage of this opportunity and shames Munna in front of his parents. And when they leave, Munna swears to take revenge by becoming a doctor himself. And obviously being a goon and having no knowledge about the hardships that medical students face, he uses every tool in his arsenal to make his parents proud, until the point he realises what he's doing is wrong and he should forget about it.Although this film seems like it has been made by a very experienced director, it's actually Rajkumar Hirani's first film! Yup, let that sink in. It's the perfect blend of comedy and drama. It can make anyone laugh in one scene, then cry in the very next and then laugh again in the very next scene. I really wish Bollywood made more such movies, since I believe 2000s was the last decade where Bollywood was experimenting with such films. Nowadays it's just remakes, biopics and sequels of decades old films that no one asked for. But it's films like this that keep my hope for an iconic comedy film from Bollywood still alive.",

            "content": "Seldom do you find a film, with so much soul, that it warms your heart while enjoying the journey alongside the characters. At its heart, Munna Bhai MBBS is a fable on humanitarianism.We see it right from the beginning that even though Munna is an extortionist 'bhai', he has a sense of morale and righteousness. As he starts getting bombarded with the harsh realities of life and death, he finds his own unique ways to cope up and find solutions. A classic example of how creating a brilliant character, and then putting him in different situations can be humorously rewarding.The thematic undertones slowly accrue you with the gloomy reality of the world, masterfully crafted by Hirani. We see the repetition of some of these themes in Hirani's 2010 masterpiece '3 Idiots', showing off the immense detailing and philosophy with which he layers his films.While the story does have a few loose ends, the nature of them is such that one can happily swerve past them, giving the filmmakers the creative liberty they deserve for crafting such a story.In the writing, I also spot a technique used by Billy Wilder most frequently: make your characters talk like each other. The effect of Munna's jovial nature, directly in contrast with the sombre atmosphere in the hospital, is so resounding that other people in the space start talking like him.Most of the humour in the writing is called for, and does not sound cheap-selling or pretentious. The characters too are well crafted, and have some depth and layering to themselves. (not all...)The cinematography and sound design of the film are minimalistic, akin to the editing. I say this in a positive light. Nothing groundbreaking, but nothing deal-breaking either.For the era, I do not find the music to be particularly impressive. It may be that Hirani did not want the music to drive any attention away from the main subject of the film, but I am still inclined to not appreciating the 'song treatment'. The background score does a fair job, bubbling with nostalgic background vocals, archetypical of the time :p\nI always choose to judge a film not by the execution of the director, but by the Universe his executions have created, and the emotions in it. In that regard, MUNNA BHAI has done a really good job!I recommend to all!",

It is a pleasant departure from his usual gun-totting gangster self that he otherwise is known to play.+ Music: It is sort of a comeback for Anu Malik who was fading away from the limelight at that time. Brilliant music.+ Supporting cast: Arshad Warsi gets to redeem himself as Munna's sidekick and takes the film to a whole new level. Sunil Dutt plays his last ever role as Sanjay Dutt's father himself and enthralls us all. Gracy Singh also gets to make a comeback after a slew of mediocre films. Boman Irani plays the character that would define him for the rest of his career.Length : As is with most Bollywood films, the length of Munnabhai M.B.B.S. is something that could have been managed by cutting it down a little.Munnabhai M.B.B.S. will be remembered for a lot of things. It broke convention and told a story like never before in Indian cinema. It got together a famous real life father-son pair together on the screen and brought out a chemistry that was simply amazing to watch. It also brought together a cast of actors that were down on their lucks at that point of their careers.Munnabhai M.B.B.S. tells the story of a gangster, Munna, who has also lied to his father that he is a doctor in the city. Every visit from his parents ends up in him faking the existence of a hospital run by him. Things go haywire when Dr. Asthana, a real doctor, calls him out after Munna's father proposes that Asthana's daughter get married to Munna. Left red-faced and embarrassed in front of his father, who vows never to see him again, Munna decides to become a real doctor to teach Asthana a lesson and win back the trust of his father.Directed by the incredibly talented and the then debutant, Rajkumar Hirani, Munnabhai... will forever be remembered for being a sweet comedy that taught people something while entertaining as well. The term \"jaadu ki jhappi\" will be something that will stay with every Munnabhai fan for years to come. One can also never forget Arshad Warsi as Circuit, the sidekick who has a heart of gold.Munnabhai will also be remembered for the chemistry between Munna and Circuit. They make it look so real and believable that is is difficult not to fall for their characters.Sanjay Dutt rules the screen as Munnabhai. He even surpasses his performance in Vaastav with his role as the gangster with a heart.Munnabhai is a special film. It set the ball rolling for a host of adaptations by regional filmmakers. Even Hollywood sat up and took notice. It is the film that will be etched in our memories as our all time favorite gangster film.",

It is a rare combination of several good works inclusive of music.I just wanted to write this comment about the theme of the movie. It is impossible not to draw parallelism with Patch Adams, but I believe it is invain - as the comparison stops in the beginning itself. I saw this movie and had the feeling of a roller coaster ride and enjoyed immensely (laughed and cried at the same time). However, there was a sort of uncomfortable feeling precipitated in me after seeing the movie. I do not know how to understand that. I am not sure whether it is generated because a tapori like Munnabhai can question the age old wisdom and education or because it promotes unconventional things, but certainly there is a difference here. Patch Adams is a regular doctor takes on the system of medicine but Munnabhai....... I could not delve more into this because I liked the movie so much.",
