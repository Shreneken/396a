This is not a bad movie - it's a war crime. Somehow the producers actually managed to cast supporting players bad enough to make Kelly Clarkson and even the talent free Justin Guarini seem good by comparsion.The alleged \"choreography\" ammounts to nothing more than frantic flailing of limbs. Accents come and go with wild abandon. The songs are, to put it charitably, forgettable. I'm surprised \"American Idol\" judge Randy Jackson isn't credited as a writer, because the dialouge is that witless and badly phrased.This is the worst thing humanity has ever done.",

            "content": "Yes, it finally came on cable. And, in order to keep up my credentials as an expert on badfilm, I had to deal with this monstrosity sooner or later. So, without further ado... Oh...my...God... Who thought this was a good idea? Trying to make a quick buck off of a flavor-of-the-week TV show I can understand, but who thought this had any chance of success? Too retarded for anyone over 14; too campy and too much like a \"Gidget\" remake for the 9-14 set; too much skin for the \"Barney the Dinosaur\" crowd. Not enough plot for a 30 minute sitcom, and every teensploiter movie clich\u00e9 ever, without either the humor (the saving grace for the good ones) or the nudity (sometimes, the saving grace for the bad ones). Anyway, a few random notes: 1. One of the first songs was Kelly Clarkson's remake of \"Vacation\" by the Go-Go's. I always considered this to be a light, bouncy pop song. That was, of course, until Kelly and her overproduction team sucked the life out of it. Now as bouncy as a Complin Service, this one made me wish for a brief return of the early, punk, Go-Go's, who probably would have roughed up anyone who did one of their songs this badly. 2. Justin, teen heartthrob? He is so thin I might be able to tie a string to him and fly him on a high wind day! With that 'fro, he looks a little like a pipe cleaner. Note to the Director: having Justin wear a black shirt when all the other guys in a song set are shirtless is not hiding anything; he sticks out like, well like a black pipe cleaner in a sea of artificial tan.3. Aw, look: the obvious backstabbing friend/ nemesis slut girl with the hee-haw southern accent is trying to steal Kelly's scenes away from her by overacting in contrast to Kelly's underacting! Sorry, young lady obviously chosen for your ability to pack a small swimsuit: nobody who cares is watching. 4. Justin's \"nerd\" friend/ sidekick: you can almost see the lineage trace lines, going back through far superior nerd/ sidekicks (\"Better off Dead,\" \"Ferris Bueller's Day off\"), all the way back to the early \"Beach Party\" movies and Rebel Without a Cause. In fact, his clothes seem to be lifted from the outfits from the early \"Beach Party\" movies' nerd/sidekick wardrobes; if they actually date from the early 1960's, they might be considered retro/cool in some circles and thus worth more than the rest of this film. 5. Oh, the intense chemistry between Justin and Kelly... Really, I am serious. Oh, yes. Alan Rickman and Kate Winslet, in Sense and Sensibility, were an overflowing cauldron of unrestrained sexual passion compared to these two. If Justin was trying to dispel those \"man's man\" rumors, this did nothing to help. How to get the movie to go from sluggish to dead in the water: Justin and Kelly, alone, in a scene for more than five seconds. 6. Kelly's nice black friend is being taken to a ritzy Latin nightclub, which is located in...an abandoned corrugated metal shack??? I need to check that abandoned building on the next block; the Cotton Club might have started a branch there. Mitigating factor: the Latin dancers were way more talented than the blandly white beach dancers in the other scenes.7. OK, Kelly, so you admire Bjork. I can see you appreciate her independence, willingness to go her own way, and most of all given your situation, her career longevity. If you want to do a homage to Bjork, altering your bland, middle-of-the-road song delivery would be a good place to start. Your hairdo was, in fact, not a good place to start.8. Hee-haw girl does a bad impersonation of Madonna's \"Material Girl\" video. Which means, of course, she is doing an even worse second-derivative impersonation of Marilyn Monroe. This has no purpose other than to satisfy some requirement in her contract that she got to be the lead in one song number. 9. Telepathic singing? Oh, no- \"Glitter\" flashbacks! 10. Justin in a game of hovercraft dodge-ball? The stunt double must be a girl to get the sizes right. Oh, look, the danger: he has lost control of a motorized inflatable hovercraft in three feet of warm water!11. Hee-haw evil girl is proud of notching up various studs, and now she is hitting on- Justin??? 12. THAT was how evil hee-haw girl's plots were discovered? Did the budget get pulled, and they needed a way of wrapping up the plot faster than you could say \"Deus Ex Machina?\" 13. The final massive musical number: a K.C. and the Sunshine Band cover! While deeply painful on so many levels (including watching nerd-boy dance), at least they mangled an already bad song, rather than torture a once respectable song. Anyway, yes, this movie is just as bad as you have heard.",

The end result, a soup sandwich with no audience. The fact that what works on television doesn't always work on the \"big screen,\" is true in the case of From Justin to Kelly. The production value is professional and many of the dance numbers took long hours and hours to practice and to get right. Still, nobody cares. The movie itself (on paper) was a joke to begin with. There are only a handful of lines worth hearing through this 90 minute movie. The rest can be considered pop-culture junk or better yet, left overs that nobody wants to have for dinner.",

            "content": "Before Kelly Clarkson actually started producing some decent pop, this was pretty much the only product of American Idol for a bit. And what an product it was. The sheer lack of enthusiasm put forward in this movie is, to say the least, daunting.Set during a spring break, Kelly, the clich\u00e9d Texan girl who wants to be a big singer but is stuck in a lowly bar, runs into Justin, who smiles an abnormally large amount and has a really, seriously ridiculous perm. I mean, come on. It looks like cotton candy. They both go to Florida, and watch loads of \"babes\" and do a bunch of PG-13 related spring break hi-jinks, of which there aren't many. Hence why they're college hi-jinks. Doi.Anyway, after a rather dumb meet cute between Justin and Kelly, the plot, which would have difficulty filling up a 22 minute sitcom let alone this 90 minute trash fest, begins to unfold. Basically, Kelly's blonde friend wants Justin, and he wants Kelly, so to get revenge on him, she gives him her phone number, and then makes it look like Kelly doesn't care about him. I'm sure you can imagine the complex and thought provoking scenarios that this could spin out into, but don't hurt yourself.A quick note on the musical numbers: you have a mute button. Employ it LIBERALLY. Thank you.Obviously, From Justin to Kelly is meant for twelve year old girls, who have seen the same plot a couple of dozen times before, only this time it doesn't involve Barbie and/or Fairies (insert joke here). If you are a twelve year old girl, go rent Sleepover. It's much better than this, and it has cute boys. If you're not a twelve year old girl (which is a good thing), stay, stay away from this factory made piece of crap.",

            "review_title": "So awful I ordered the DVD!",
            "content": "After reading many a statement online that From Justin To Kelly even surpasses the demonpsawn show that spawned it for being devoid of talent, I just had to see the horror for myself. Sadly, obtaining the DVD outside of America is quite a feat in itself. In point of fact, the film has never seen so much as the light of day outside of the States, which is a very bad sign in itself. Released at a time when the American Idol program had just gotten started with saturating us in its contestants' sameness, From Justin To Kelly is elegant proof that the smaller the budget, the bigger the fallout when your film fails to make it back. Produced on a mere twelve million dollars, FJTK presented us with an endless array of stupid dance sequences, stupid songs, and an incredibly stupid plot to string it all together. I guess they wanted to prove that William Hung was not the worst possible thing that could come out of the herd conformist display that is Idol. In order to spare you some agony, I will now try to recount the plot.FJTK begins with Kelly performing a number in a Texan bar, to the delight of what appears to be the only audience member. When finished, she is approached by friends to go on a trip with them to Florida for Spring break. Characterisation is not exactly a strong suit for this film. Kelly's accomplices consist of Bland Black Girl and Anorexic White Girl Who Feels Compelled To Steal Any Guy Whom Kelly Develops An Interest In. With friends like those, who needs a personality? Anyway, things take a turn for the worst when Justin, accompanied by slightly less bland but even more daft friends, arrive at the same beach. The first of many mass song and dance numbers ensues, and thus we get the first of many strange face-pulling contests. At one point in this beach musical number, Kelly looks as if she is going to distend her jaw and devour Justin whole. Professional actors these ain't. Of course, even an eighty-minute film cannot keep going without some semblance of a plot, and what a doozy FJTK offers.Much of the plot in FJTK concerns itself with the fact that Justin wants Kelly, Kelly wants Justin, and Kelly's anorexic friend wants to keep them apart for some reason. Well-scripted this ain't. Coming off as an extended episode of one of those family sitcoms that enjoyed a brief revival in the 1990s, FJTK barely has enough plot to sustain twenty-three minutes. So a lot of padding with musical numbers takes place. The thing with musical numbers in film is that there needs to be a logical progression from the dialogue into the music. When characters burst into song at the drop of a hat, it is jarring, and generally lessens the impact. And that is probably the biggest of the problems FJTK faces. Not only are the musical numbers insipid and bland, they also have no logical flow from the rest of the film. The plot literally comes to a standstill whilst the characters sing, dance, and pull the kind of faces people usually make in order to deliberately ruin shots. The words \"cash in\" spring to mind.Fortunately, FJTK did accomplish one task. It sorted out the genuine talent from the hangers-on where American Idiot was concerned. With the film all but buried, Kelly Clarkson put it all behind her and concentrated on a recording career. Not that I would go out of my way to listen to her recordings, but she at least seems to be branching out and exploring a wider variety of material. Justin Guarini, on the other hand, seems to have disappeared off the face of the Earth, which is probably just as well after the demon yawn face he pulls during one classic(ally bad) number during FJTK. About the only other individual to survive association with the project was Anika Noni Rose, and I think that was mainly because she hung around in the background, not really standing out in any fashion. Brian Dietzen, however, takes out the prize for the most insipid, irritating character of the piece. Every time this man opens his mouth, I feel like I want to punch him. Although that might inspire another pathetic song and dance number.So FJTK occupies a place of pride in my DVD collection. I drag it out whenever someone tries to tell me they know what a bad film is. I have even sat through the extended version, and listened to the audio commentary. It is just too bad that we no longer have MST3K, as a riffing of FJTK would probably be worth front-row seating. Most people would not dare admit having seen this film to another human being, but I am different. I am proud of the fact that I have seen the lowest that Hollywood can possibly sink, and believe me, FJTK is exactly that. Other films might come out that are worse, or more entertaining in a bad way, but FJTK is literally the lowest point. It was conceived for no other purpose than to wring more money out of a lowest-common-denominator-rules \"talent\" quest, and its makers did not even deem it worthy of an effort commensurate with such an atrocious goal. If nothing else, it serves as a great lesson in the duality of art: for every renaissance, there is a time of stagnation.Needless to say, I gave From Justin To Kelly a one out of ten. Easily the most insipid film you will see in your lifetime, it is even a disgrace to bad cinema.",

I sat with a dull glazed look in my eyes,cemented there out of boredom and just utter disbelief! This movie put me in mind of when they tried to do a Village People movie (\"Can't Stop The Music\"),just Hollywood once again jumping down the throat of the latest \"big thing\" before it gets old. I can see all the kids & teens who more than likely pestered their parents to give them $$ to see this waste of celluloid!

Any young person who \"liked\" this film,check back in a few years and tell me you''ll still feel the same!I also could compare this to the \"Beach Blanket\" movies of Frankie Avalon and Annette Funnicello but that would be an insult to them and their films. \"Justin and Kelly\" makes Frankie and Annette's outings look like \"Dead Poet's Society\"!

Tune in not too far from now,you wont be able to \"give\" this movie away! Of course,the fact that it starred non-actors should have gave away that it was fiasco-bound!

I do like her voice, and the melodies were memorable and the lyrics catchy, but overtime the appeal has diminished. And it wasn't helped by watching this movie, which I actually saw to see whether Clarkson was any good as an actress. My conclusion is that she is a talented singer, but an actress, oh well. Her chemistry with her co-star is rather bland, and Justin Guarini has an acting style that feels forced and unnatural. The characters are never that likable either, they seem clich\u00e9d and artificial at best. The scenery is nice enough but the cinematography goes at odd angles and the editing is haphazard. The dialogue is terrible, I haven't seen such inept directing and choreography in a long time and as for story, forget it. The best asset is the soundtrack but even that felt as though it was there for the sake of it. Overall, an awful film but I have seen worse. 1/10 Bethany Cox",

This name recognition could potentially raise two problems. First is the prospect that you might already be familiar with the movie and thus take issue with something incorrect I might write. This differs from a review of \"Idiot Vampire Movie #277\" or whatever other nonsense I write about, where only four people on the planet have seen the movie in its entirety and I could have written the entire thing using a Ouija board without anyone knowing better. The second problem might be that you have actually seen the movie and so this review is redundant. Of course, anyone who watched this movie probably had enough pent up self loathing that they have already ridden the vein pain train in a lukewarm bathtub. In which case, congratulations on being dead! It is obvious you didn't quite make it into Heaven, which has a standing gag order against anything related to \"American Idol\". Better luck next time.What do you get when you take two flash-in-the-pan celebrities from a reality TV show and fling them in front of a camera without any lessons in screen acting, line reading, or simulating basic human emotion? \"From Justin to Kelly\" decided to find out. I suppose it's fitting that one of the worst shows on television today would have managed to spawn a Hollywood film that manages to raid the lint traps of sheer ineptitude so severely that it makes \"Battlefield Earth\" look like a sci-fi epic for the ages. Not only could neither Justin nor Kelly act their way out of a paper bag, but they wouldn't be qualified to deliver bag lunches to the other soap actors on set. Thankfully, one half of the dynamic duo has already returned to blissful obscurity. We can only hope this movie will soon follow. I am not sure if this movie is taking place in an alternate timeframe where Kelly was never discovered and instead was forced to perform to audiences numbering in the single digits, or if it's supposed to take place in 2007 when the same will probably be true.I suppose I can't fault the producers of \"American Idol\" for wanting to make another quick buck off their inexplicably popular TV show. Nor can I really fault two okayish singers lucky enough to land a starring role in a movie out of the blue because they weren't as horrible as everyone else. Someone has to be responsible for this mess, though, and I guess the most obvious blame falls on the people who voted Justin and Kelly into their positions as the final two American Idols: namely, the American public.

I somehow imagine if those yutes went to spring break, From Justin to Kelly would be the result.This movie truly makes me want to say: REALLY? out loud and very loud.

To put it in perspective, this is the 2003 equivalent of the I Love Lucy's two beds for married couples in the 1950s.Basically, two Disney characters briefly meet and have, ah-hem, chemistry (or so they tell us) and spend the rest of the movie trying to hook-up (meaning, just have a convo) while someone tries to keep them apart.I understand this movie was planned before it had a script and before it even had a cast \u2013 so I guess also before it had a title. It all shows. It was thrown together last minute and it will go down as one of the worst excuses for a TV/Movie tie-in ever.Do NOT watch this.

Still, that does not mean I wouldn't enjoy it. I have liked a lot of \"feel good, girly\" films that many hate such as Gigli, Glitter and Crossroads and I always clear my mind and give any film a chance at impressing me, and sometimes people are just way too harsh on films that are merely a cute, fun time. This film, however, is not the case. It is as bad as it's made out to be, and I'll tell you why.The acting is stale from every cast member. No one puts on a believable or even cheesy likable performance, including the main two \"stars\", which you think they would be able to muster some acting talent being the finalists of American Idol's first season... (joking). Whose idea was it to make a film off singers from a reality TV contest? The plot? There isn't one. A bunch of party thirsty teens that do nothing more than consume space on the screen and run around insipidly throwing outdated teenage slang here and there, not putting on a show attention-grabbing enough to interest children, teenagers, or adults. Don't even get me started on the songs and dance scenes. Oh my sweet Jesus, all every song does is occupy time, nothing more. They are all nowhere near catchy, and the choreography is some of the worst I have seen in any movie, ever. Even the sets are dull and completely opposite of breathtaking, and the direction is honestly home-video worthy at times.So basically, there were no redeeming qualities about this film. I am lighthearted, and like lots of movies people consider bad, and can usually laugh at films that I myself find bad. Not one chuckle, or smile, or any emotion ran across my face while watching this movie. It really is that bland and uninspiring, I felt robbed of the runtime after watching it and felt I could have done something more useful with my time like watch leaves fall. I don't plan on ever watching it again.",

Cinematic garbage responsible for sending people into a faze of heavy drinking and severe counselling. Story is based upon a couple who grew famous through a program called American Idol and becomes one of the most embarrassing musicals since Xanadu. Justin Guarini and Kelly Clarkson meet in a girls washroom and spend the rest of the film victimized by wrong information and near misses. The dance numbers should be shown to prison inmates as a form of punishment. Half-hearted directing by Robert Iscove whose career contains such crap as She's all That and Boys and Girls. Justin and Kelly deliver performances that qualify for a stiff fine. The makers of American Idol can only hope that this pathetic showcase doesn't damage their reputation. Katherine Bailess plays Clarkson's best friend who is out to steal her man. Theresa San-Nicholas has a laughable role as a beach patrol officer who has the personality of a tub toy. What she should have stole was the script along with matches. Nobody else seems to come across as remotely intelligence either. Pointless garbage promoting American Idol but should be hacked into guitar picks. Score: 1 / 10",

            "content": "Backing my courageous assertion that I must watch everything and anything I come across, here is From Justin to Kelly. This 2003 \"musical\" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Penned by Kim Fuller, the brother of American Idol creator Simon Fuller, From Justin to Kelly features Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini partying it up during one of the lamest spring breaks on record.Is this some sort of elaborate joke? Can a movie actually be this bad? What the hell is Clarkson wearing? Why, dear Jesus, why?Clarkson stars in this catastrophe as some sort of downhome Texas waitress named Kelly. She's the most conservative of her three friends. The other two are flat stereotypes: one is a shifty and confusingly manipulative blonde girl (Katherine Bailess) and the other is the token black friend (Anika Noni Rose). The two girls convince Kelly that she needs to take some time off from singing and waiting tables in this bar, so they head to Fort Lauderdale.In Fort Lauderdale, Guarini is the inventively-named Justin. See? Justin and Kelly, just like on TV! Justin is some sort of party promoter and he also hangs out with two stereotypes: a nerd (Brian Dietzen) meeting a girl from the enchanted and apparently still profound internet and some buff loser (Greg Siff). Justin and Kelly \"meet\" in a stupid dance number and fall in love, but the confusingly manipulative blonde \"friend\" of Kelly's gets in the way. Will Justin and Kelly overcome the befuddling text messages and strange overtures?From Justin to Kelly plays out like a teen movie written and produced by people who were teens about 78 years ago. There's this preposterous attempt to \"understand\" teen culture, but this drivel makes High School Musical look like Gone with the Wind. There are \"dance\" numbers, \"songs\" and \"song-and-dance\" numbers. The stereotypes fit in the right places and the movie's obligatory scoundrel turns out to be a Machiavellian curiosity that still leaves as one of Kelly's best friends.The \"songs\" in From Justin to Kelly are bad. The \"dancing\" is bad. The \"acting\" is bad. The \"screenplay\" is bad. The \"characters\" are bad. The \"scenery\" is bad. The \"camerawork\" is bad. The \"direction\" is bad. The \"titles\" are bad. The \"end credits\" are bad. Any \"animal actors\" are bad. The \"food\" is bad. Everything, and I mean everything, is bad.Brandon, the aforementioned buff loser, raps. The nerd meets a strange- looking girl from the internet. Kelly and Justin sing on a boat. Kelly sings a song holding her purse walking down the beach after leaving a bar without her purse. There's a bald steroid freak, apparently, and a dude that looks to be about 45 hanging around moaning about losing his girlfriend to somebody he never lost his girlfriend to. There's a whipped cream bikini contest that isn't the least bit interesting. Seriously.This is spring break zaniness for the Disney set, an imagined and hopeful view of what people in their twenties are up to when all bets are off and the night can cover the sins of the day. Hannah Montana is more hedonistic. Or so I've heard.At the end of the day, I found myself somewhat proud of the grand achievement of having made it through From Justin to Kelly. I felt like I had accomplished something spectacular, like I had really done the world some sort of service. Any of my other failings were quickly glossed over by the realization that I made it. Any sense of inadequacy was gone. I made it. I lived to tell.",

The transitions into these musical numbers were so awkward. And the songs themselves were not remotely entertaining. Kelly comes off as likable in the movie but I grew to despise every other character in the space of 15 minutes. I don't see this becoming a cult classic.

            "content": "May contain spoilers!Okay, the reason this got a 4 (which normally would have been lower) is because of a few things that make this movie not AS bad as some of these reviews say. Most are for nostalgic reasons.I saw this in probably 2004-05 when I was in middle school, and decided to pick it up from Blockbuster, just because. At this time in my life, it was this fun spring break movie that was entertaining to watch with my friends. This was mostly due to the simple plot, all the fun going on and the allure of being in Miami ( which IS fun, I had already been). Back then, I didn't really see anything wrong with it, but I wasn't the best judge of acting.Now that I've watched it in my early 20's, for the first time in ages, I feel like I can give it a proper review. Yikes, it's pretty cringe-y. So first you have the acting. Kelly's actually starts out okay to me, and is decent despite no acting roles, but then it kind of goes from bad to worse after that. Everyone else is not too too bad, Justin is slightly better than Kelly, but Katherine Bailess's accent is OVERWHELMINGLY annoying. And I'm from Alabama! I just wanted her to stop. Besides that, you will want to punch her character a thousand times, and then you wonder how Kelly and Kaya (Anika Noni Rose) are even friends with someone like that. Another downside is the musical numbers, the only one that's kind of fun/funny is the beginning number on the beach, and all the others are hard to watch- the lip syncing, the actual songs themselves... everything. A few of the things I like, still, are the vacation atmosphere, and, well.. that's pretty much all. Honorable mentions are Anika Noni Rose's acting as Kaya ( she gives the best performance out of everyone, IMO) especially given her material to work with and her choice of guys is the most believable/ most worth investing in; also, Brian Dietzen (pre-NCIS) with his sunburn and woman troubles is somewhat funny. Guys are going to hate this no matter what because it's already bad, they tend to hate musicals (like mine does) and it's about crushes and love. The only thing they might watch this for is the women on the beach.If you want to relive childhood a little because you remember watching it then, that's the only reason why you might want to continue watching it later in life, seeing as that's my only reason. A lot of times we can watch things that aren't good because they bring back some sort of sentimental value, even though they kind of suck. Other than the few things I mentioned, it's a waste of time if none of these themes appeal to you at all.",

Concocted as a \"beach party\" film like the old 50s movies... this film never gets off the ground.. The story (from the writer of \"Spice World\" no less) has something to do with spring break (though a sanitized \"G\" rated version of spring break).... but I never did make much sense of it.. the song choreography was dreadful and the direction atrocious, the worst possible framing of every shot... to hamper any enjoyment you might get out of the film.. the singing sequences should have been the thrust of the film but with the choreography bad and the lip-synching just plain terrible if anything it's laughable. Kelly Clarkson has least has some minuscule amount of screen presence, though her lack of acting experience is certainly noticeable.. Justin Guarini however is just plain awful. from the moment he walks on screen you want to hurl stuff at him... This is one guy whose 15 minutes are way way done. I'm sure that by now I have explained just how dreadfully bad this movie is.. take every bad film you've seen and watch them over and over again and you still won't experience the agony that is sitting through even five minutes of this movie.

Frankie and Annette having been replaced now by Justin Guarini (who?) and Kelly Clarkson. Guarini, the runner-up from the first season of American Idol that Clarkson won, has the worst hair and smiles nonstop. His acting is awful but, to be fair, so is everybody else's. Including Kelly, I'm sad to say. The two leads have no chemistry and their romance is about as forced as you can imagine a movie built around the two finalists from a singing competition would be. The music is terrible pre-packaged generic pop crap. Not a single song is worth remembering. It's a terrible movie made with poor intentions and not the slightest bit of artistry.

Unfortunately that's not what we got.\"From Justin to Kelly\" tells the story of, hey, wouldn't you know, Justin and Kelly, young hipsters who find love while partying at Spring Break. A couple wacky missteps lead to a meet cute in the girls' restroom, and after Justin loses Kelly's cell phone number he tries just about anything to win her heart, almost all with disastrous results. Will she realize he's the one for her before Spring break ends? (Take a guess...)It sounds like a fun, simple story, right? Unfortunately the main plot thread is so flimsy there are several other stories interwoven to pad out the film, all of which focus on other characters that are more easily identified with their roles than their actual names. There's the Internet Geek, who \"hilariously\" keeps missing his dates with his chat room sweetie. There's the Southern Slut, who tries to sabotage Justin and Kelly's relationship but Just Wants To Be Loved. There's the Sassy Black Girl, who romances the hunky Carlos and sneaks onto the \"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\" set with him. Then there's the Studly Capitalist, whose get-rich-quick schemes keep getting busted by that one frigid policewoman who just might be a total hottie under that ponytail. None of these little subplots are the least bit interesting, but hey, they make Justin and Kelly's story seem that much better by comparison. There are several reasons why this movie fails. For starters, it's a weak homage to all the beach musicals of decades past, and since it's played totally straight, scenes like Justin battling a rival for Kelly's affections in a hovercraft race are ridiculous rather than amusing. Second, the Spring Break pictured here is suspiciously free of any alcohol or \"Girls Gone Wild\" cameramen, and even racy activities like whipped cream bikini contests are as wholesome as apple pie, or Kelly Clarkson's image. Third, it's a bad comedy. Bad drama at least can give you some laughs, but bad comedy is just painful. Finally we come to the music, as it should be no surprise to anyone reading this that \"From Justin to Kelly\" was only made to capitalize on Justin Guarini and Kelly Clarkson's popularity after the original \"American Idol.\" The songs are forgettable, but not groan-inducing like the ones in other bad musicals like \"Grease 2.\" Aside from covers of \"Vacation\" and \"That's The Way I Like it\" I couldn't give you the titles of any of the songs featured. And that, to me, is what separates \"From Justin to Kelly\" from the other MST3K fodder; it's a waste of film, but so completely forgettable it's not worth all the fuss.",

The three guys consist of the computer nerd who is a virgin and his two horn-dog friends. Why would they be together?! This makes no sense. The girls consist of two horn-dog girls (one is Black...this is SO enlightened) and a virgin. Again, why would they hang together with such ridiculously different values?! Players and hos and geeks....that's all there seems to be with this film. With words such as 'hotties', 'studs' and 'whipped cream', this film is insulting, demeaning and completely value-less. And who would like this movie? If you are a total perv, you won't like it because there is no sex or nudity despite the sexually charged plot. If you have any sense a self-worth or values, you won't want to sit and listen to a bunch of shallow slugs talking non-stop about sex...and not much else.Overall, a sleazy, valueless mess. Everyone is a sleaze-bag--and they sing and dance more than folks in a typical Bollywood musical! There is nothing to like or appreciate about the film--just a bunch of talentless jerks and it reaches a level of shallowness that would probably make even Paris Hilton cringe. Not surprisingly, the film is ranked #23 among the Bottom 100 on IMDb--a position that it clearly deserved.",

(Over here it was never released at all, and seems to have gone straight to cable.) This sadly does live up to all the things people have said about it - it would qualify as the worst musical I've ever seen, but I still haven't managed to repress every detail of Cliff Richard's \"Take Me High.\" To Kelly Clarkson's credit, she has since confessed to hating this movie; and since the round-rumped one is just about the only good thing to ever come from reality-TV-generated music - some would say she is to America what Girls Aloud are to Britain, but Kelly can actually sing and there's only one of her (and at least I can tell her apart from Justin Guarini, whereas I keep getting the Girls confused) - she's also the closest thing to something tolerable in this movie. The story's not worth bothering with, the acting makes \"Saved By The Bell\" look like \"Angels In America,\" and the music... shudder. Call me old-fashioned, but there's something seriously wrong with a musical where all the original songs, all the singing, and all the dancing is synthetic and soulless. And embarrassing. It's like you're watching a spoof of musicals, except this isn't.The worst thing is that you may be begging for them to stop torturing you with setpieces lamer than Ironside out of a wheelchair, but when they return to the who-cares storyline (not helped by Kelly and Justin having all the romantic chemistry of Dick Dastardly and Yankee Doodle Pigeon) you're begging for the music to start again. And as Kelly's version of \"Vacation\" and the running \"gag\" of the token nerd trying to meet his Internet girlfriend and failing... spare me.Kelly Clarkson has managed to put this behind her, but Justin Guarini and nearly everyone else in this movie has never been heard of again.

            "content": "\"From Justin to Kelly\" is the worst kind of bad movie; the kind that's so uninspired and dull you can't even make fun of it. It's spring break in Florida. Kelly Taylor (Kelly Clarkson) needs a break from her waiting and entertaining job and although she's not super anxious to go, she's convinced by her friends Alexa (Katherine Bailess) and Kaya (Anika Noni Rose) that a little vacation is just what she needs. In Fort Lauderdale, Justin Bell (Justin Guarini) and his friend Carlos (Jason Yribar) are reaping the benefits of the crowds of teenagers by setting up competitions and parties while their friend Eddie (Brian Dietzen) is trying to meet up with his internet crush. When they all meet up on the beach, Justin is very interested in Kelly, but she suspects he's too party-crazy and wouldn't be interested in a real relationship. Alexa however, thinks he's just the kind of guy she wants and she won't let him get away. She repeatedly jumps between them with text messages and leads Justin to believe that Kelly is not interested despite the fact that the more time they spend together, the more the two leads start to fall for each other. During these misunderstandings, Kaya is starting a relationship with a sexy busboy named Carlos and although he hasn't had any luck with the ladies, Brandon keeps bumping into a sexy beach patrol woman and he's convinced it's only a matter of time before she falls for him. If you're expecting a whole lot of singing, spontaneously choreographed dance numbers and predictable love plots, then you've come to the right place.It's just a by-the-books beach romance story that's been padded out to 1hr 21 minutes by throwing in a bunch of songs, one dimensional characters and light-as-air romance plots. It's clear that Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini have talent, but the songs they're given aren't memorable and weren't made for them so it just feels like a waste of time. The acting is spotty at best, you can tell by the fact that both Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini's characters' first names are the same as theirs. In the actors' defense though, it's blatantly obvious that this film was made due to contractual obligation. Why else would you have the winner and runner-up of a competition act together in a romantic movie when neither of them have any acting experience, and limited professional singing experience too? I suspect the whole thing was dug up from a dusty box of \"quick, cheap teenage plots\", rewritten a little bit and then shipped out to a crew that wasn't passionate at all about the project to capitalize on the immediate popularity of the stars. Even aside from the technical standpoint of the writing, the movie isn't put together very competently. It's poorly edited and looks more like a music video than a movie when there's singing and dancing and poorly acted when there isn't. If you're a fan of either Kelly Clarkson or Justin Guarini, or even of \"American Idol\", skip \"From Justin to Kelly\" and just listen to one of their albums instead.

Film starts out in Texas where Kelly (Kelly Clarkson) is a waitress in a bar and her friends Alexa (Katherine Bailess) and Kaya (Anika Noni Rose) talk her into going to spring break in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. When they get there they bump into three boys who are there to set up contests on the beach for a profit. Justin (Justin Guarini) meets Kelly and the two are instantly attracted to one another but Alexa is jealous of her and gives Justin her own cell phone number instead of Kelly's so that she can sabotage their dates. Meanwhile, Kaya meets a dishwasher named Carlo (Jason Yribar) and they go out dancing one night but the next day she yells at his boss and gets Carlo fired.\nThis film was directed by Robert Iscove and he's actually a pretty competent television director which is appropriate because this film plays like a badly written sitcom. The story is more or less an updated version of the beach comedies starring Frankie and Annette but in those films they at least tried to do some things differently. This film plays it extremely safe to the point where everything you think will happen does. There is absolutely no surprises that take place. Clarkson and Guarini do they're own singing and Clarkson actually has a good voice so I do give them credit for that but unfortunately the songs are of the \"American Idol\" variety. They don't sound contemporary and are very cheesy but so is everything about this film. If you hate the songs then you'll despise the dancing. Justin and Kelly are decent singers but they are just not dancers by anyones definition. The numbers appear clumsily choreographed and many of the performers do not dance in the same step or rhythm. Very lightweight script makes \"Fraternity Vacation\" seem like \"The Caine Mutiny\" and its evident that this was written very quickly to try and cash in on the success of \"American Idol\". One of the producers is the one and only Simon Fuller who created the television series and he underestimated the intelligence of the people who actually pay money to view something.",

This movie was made only for one reason, to capitalize on her and Justin's popularity before it faded.

But the movie has lots of energy, a 'beach blanket' type of movie popular in the 1960s, and is a satisfying 85 minutes. I know Kelly and Justin tried to get out of making this, still, being in their own movie will be a lasting memory for them. And for me because I have my own copy of the DVD. I realize there is lots of hate for this movie, most unjustified, because for what it is, a fluff of a Spring Break movie, it isn't that bad.June 2020 update: I just watched it again after 16+ years just for nostalgia. I don't know what Justin has been up to but Kelly has had quite a nice career with lots of hit songs. And currently she is host of her own daytime talk and entertainment TV show.

What apparently makes this one special, are the two leads, the winner and runner up of American Idol.As a European (with it's own 'Idol' contest, quite an enjoyable show I must say), I'm not too familiar with Kelly Clarkson, and I hadn't heard from Justin Guarini (or, as someone says in the movie, Sideshow Bob, best joke of the movie) yet. So that's not a reason to watch the movie. As there are other things that were so predictable, the movie was disappointing even by it's own low standards (as the IMDB score would suggest).The two leads both bring their friends to the beach during 'Spring Break', and these friends are about the flattest characters you will ever see in a movie. It includes a computer nerd, a cocky womanizer and a party girl. Only substance among the supporting cast comes from Anika Noni Rose, who plays a girl named Kaya, who falls in love with a local bartender/dishwasher. Rest of the cast are just a bunch of highly attractive extra's... I actually didn't see ONE fat or unattractive person during the entire movie... but lets not get into that. I know, I know, it's just a movie.Biggest part among the supporters is for Katherine Bailess, who plays Alexa, who also takes a liking in Justin. She tries to push the two lovers away from each other, by pretending that SHE is Kelly, not answering text messages from Justin. Now, Justin, it's not forbidden to actually CALL somebody on your phone! Terrible scene when Kelly finds out about Alexa's evil plan, with Alexa explaining: 'I've always been jealous of you, I wish I was more like you!'. Really convincing, guys...Also, there's definately an overuse of songs in this one, and they're not even that good. Worst part comes when Justin and Kelly take a boatride, with him suddenly starting to sing this horrible, so called romantic song. Yuck.Although the movie only runs for about 80 minutes, it's a drag in the last 30 or so minutes, with the songs getting even worse and the story just looking for it's ending. Which eventually comes with yet another annoying party, with the whole cast singing 'That's the way I like it' for about 10 minutes.Bad and annoying, this one. 2/10.",

However, from the moment Justin meets Kelly, he likes what he sees and she has eyes for him, too. But, Kelly's friend Alexa creates havoc for their connections, by text messaging Justin with false information, from time to time. Justin and Kelly do spend one beautiful day, out on the ocean in a boat. Is it true love? This is definitely the \"hip-hop\" version of where the boys are. Everyone is half-dressed and talking about sex, sex, sex, most of the time. Yes, the stars are all very attractive and young, with great singing voices.

So far, that theory has been proved right.Let me state for the record that I despise American Idol. I think the show is a commercial shillfest that represents the lowest level that Amercian television has sunken. What could have been a cute, tasteful idea is ruined by the greediness of FOX and RCA.I also think that while a lot of people love the show, they won't admit it to anyone. Saying that you love American Idol is akin to saying that your into S&M or something like that. I wouldn't blame them if they were afraid to admit they like this joke.When I heard they had made a movie starring Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini (the winner and runner-up of the first AI), I was interested in seeing how many of those \"fans\" would show up to see them \"act\". Well, not too many. I don't think these \"fans\" would even have the courage to rent this waste of celluloid, either.I went to see this alleged \"Grease for 2003\" with a few others to kill a couple of hours before we went bar-hopping. We were the only ones in the theater for this one; maybe a few others. The film is just that, with Clarkson playing Olivia Newton-John's Sandy to Guarini's aping of Travolta's Danny. Nobody in the cast seemed to know how to act. The singing was just overwrought, as if Simon Cowell was judging it. The script was probably written by chimps, and the production values were non-existent. Still, we had a great time laughing at how bad this film was. Every time Justin and Kelly tried to act romantic we were giggling. Some of the character's wardrobes were just too funny, too. If you think this is a great film, you must be an American Idol fanboy. If I think the film is horrid, then I'm a hater. Still, you can bet more film critics would agree with me on this one than the fanboys: From Justin To Kelly is the worst musical since Wonder Bar.",

Not too long after that, I heard on the radio (I believe from Paul Harvey) an item about a man in the southwest, who had applied at his City Hall, for a marriage license to wed his horse. Like that occurrence, this movie also proves that someone, somewhere - even in the film business - will do \"anything.\" This presentation is so AWFUL, it is fascinating (ala \"Reefer Madness,\" or \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\"). Even the singing, which would only be the most remote reason for even contemplating this ludicrous movie, is AWFUL. I'm sure Justin is probably a very nice young man, in \"real life;\" and that is where he should remain, off-stage and away from the camera. And I know the Clarkson girl has gone on to a degree of prominence in her singing, but her supposed charms and talents are lost on me, even now.

The films goal was probably to make some money and make their careers hot on the press, maybe at the time it may have succeeded but this is one lame romantic musical, with the music looking like a music video instead of a heartfelt Hollywood production. The acting is downright awful and I had to check periodically to find out if I had gone death just by listening to their dialogue. The story is no interesting its the same things you see in any teen romance but with unlike-able characters and your not rooting for the two main leads to be together. The direction is horrendous this time around from Robert Iscove who directed She's All That which I have plans on seeing in this time of love as we're closing in on Valentines Day.

            "content": "In the IMDB neighborhood, positive hype can help drive some films to a lofty place at the top of the charts. Negative hype can quickly deposit  films such as From Justin To Kelly to the bottom of the IMDB trash heap known as the worst films of all time. The question remains how much of the negativity surrounding it is deserved, and how much of it can be attributed to the usual mass hysteria where IMDB voters and reviewers alike take some kind of malevolent pleasure in the demise of a film slapped together as hastily as a Big Mac in order to cash in on the popularity of a hit television show. What is obvious is that many of the comments written in regards to this film, are by people who have never seen the film.  Some of them are bold enough to admit to this fact.  What's funny is that those who take the time to write comments about a film they haven't seen because they get a kick out of it's demise, are as culpable of as much idiocy as Executive Producer Simon Fuller(not to be confused with American Idol Judge Simon Cowell) is for giving us this film in the first place.There is no mistaking the fact that From Justin To Kelly is not a very good film.  Its sole purpose of existence is simply because Simon Fuller was intent on finding another way to rake in a few more dollars from the popularity of his cash cow known as American Idol.  I have nothing against a man filling up his bank account, but not when you do it at the cost of putting young talented performers on the screen to be scorned and ridiculed by critics and the movie going public.  The plot of From Justin To Kelly is as flimsy as a see through nightie.  Three friends from Texas, Kelly (Kelly Clarkson, Alexa (Katherine Bailess), and Kay (Anika Noni Rose)head down to the Florida beaches for boys, sand, surf, and fun in the sun.  On the other side of the continent, three Pennsylvania guys Justin (Justin Guarini), Brandon (Greg Siff), and Eddie (Brian Dietzen) head to Florida for spring break in order to rake in some cash by sponsoring such  activities as a whipped cream bikini contest or anything else they can come up with to exploit the female form.  You already know from the title that Justin and Kelly are going to meet and fall in love.  As if that weren't enough we are also mistreated to sub plots of Brandon continually being ticketed by a female cop, Eddie looking for his internet soul mate, Kay trying to make the moves on a restaurant worker, Alexa setting her eyes on Justin herself,and then conniving to get Justin for herself.  It's the sort of plot that I thought had worn out it's welcome by the late sixties when the Bikini Beach films finally faded into the obscurity they so richly deserved. \nSince this is billed as a romantic/comedy/musical I suppose we should start by commenting on the musical aspect first.  I would almost swear to the fact that there is truly no more than a couple of musical melodies in this film. The first one is where everybody breaks out on the beach in a big dance number.  The other song is when Justin and Kelly are singing an ode of love about one another.  All the songs sound the same, and only the lyrics change.  That would be OK if at least the lyrics were memorable, but they're not even audible much of the time. Most of it sounds as if someone wrote dialog on a notepad, handed it to the cast and said, \"go out and sing it\". As for the dance numbers, it's hard to say if they are truly as bad as they seem on the screen.  They are so horrendously directed and photographed that it's difficult to offer any criticism beyond that.  For instance, in the big opening number, we get shots of everybody dancing for a few seconds, interspersed with the activities of  skateboarders doing stunts in a half pipe.  It's as if whoever choreographed the film couldn't come up with more than a few dance moves at a time and the director (Robert Iscove) cuts away because it's easier than editing them into a cohesive framework.  Every single big musical number in this film is done with the same effect when the cast breaks out into song and dance. We get numerous cut shots of boats sailing, people swimming, people surfing etc. etc. etc.  It's a mess.  Worst of all, when much of this should be centering on the two stars, they are given short thrift and blandly blended into the proceedings.  As for the romantic numbers which don't require any dancing, the orchestra is so intent on overwhelming the singing of Justin and Kelly, it is difficult to find fault with their vocal ability.Judging the acting ability of some of the cast is equally difficult.  This is not a film that requires acting.  More or less it's show up, step in front of the camera, recite the lame lines screenwriter Kim Fuller(Simon Fuller's brother) typed out for you, sing when necessary and then move on to the next scene.  Justin Guarini, pretty much does what is required of him in that respect and I'm sure that greatly pleased the Fuller brothers. Unfortunately, it did little for his fast and fading career as a pop singer, and does nothing for an acting career that was going to be nonexistent anyway.  Clarkson is a different story.  It's as if she's aware of the mess surrounding her, but gives it the good old American Idol try anyway.  She does seem to have a certain amount of charisma surrounding her, but cinematographer Francis Kenny does his best to destroy it.  In one scene when Clarkson and Guarini are out on the ocean in a yacht singing one of the generic love songs, Kenny does one of the most horrendous close-ups of Clarkson imaginable.  It is so bad, that one would think they forgot to send her to the makeup room before the scene was filmed.  This happens at least twice more in the picture.  This is yet  another example where the makers of this film care so little about their cast, as long as they are making their percentage.  It becomes even more disgusting when you realize that indeed, Clarkson has terrific singing ability and a natural screen presence.  In the opening of moments of this film, when Kelly is working at a bar, someone must have told her to try a Texas accent.  It's a horrendous accent but she uses it only until we see her in the next scene and then we never hear it again.  It's as if Clarkson said, \" to hell with that nonsense\" and ditched it.  Good for her if she did.  Given a decent vehicle, a half-way decent script, and some dramatic coaching, Miss Clarkson may have eventually been able to make a few worthwhile films.  After From Justin To Kelly though, the chances of that are nil.  It's not as if Simon Fuller truly cares about the viability of a long term career in regards to his stars.  As for the rest of the cast, I can only extend my deepest sympathy to them, and suggest they have a few words with their agents about getting them stuck in this disaster.So is From Justin To Kelly one of the worst films of all time?  That's debatable I suppose, but it is certainly not the fourth worst film of all time (it's ranking as of this writing).  I have no quarrels with some of the comments written about this film, as it is truly bad.  I do believe one should place the blame where it belongs the most: Executive Producer: Simon Fuller Director: Robert Iscove Screenwriter: Kim Fuller Cinematography: Francis Kenny Choreography: Travis Payne Costume Design: Bobbie Read Original Music: Herbie Tribino & Michael Wandmacher.It is useless to continue to blame Kelly Clarkson or Justin Guarini.  They have the excuse that they are signed to an iron clad contract by Fuller. All the above mentioned, have no such excuse, and ladies and gentleman, when you have no excuse you certainly get my grade: F",

            "content": "\"From Justin to Kelly\" is on HBO right now...and I am stunned beyond belief about how bad this movie is. The acting is worse than what you would see in a 3rd grade theatre performance of Peter Rabbit. Why did movie executives allow Kelly Clarkson & Justin Guarini to star in a movie??? They could barely sing on a reality TV show, so how does that qualify them to act in a Hollywood motion picture?? Although in their \"defense\", Justin & Kelly have been given some of the worst dialogue in the history of cinema. I cannot believe I just saw a scene where after just getting to know Kelly, Justin said, without irony, that there was really \"something between us\". What guy says something that cheesy...and gets away with it??? Are you kidding me? And these scenes where the \"actors\" just break into song? They are the most unintentionally stupid scenes I've seen in some time. Justin just started singing to Kelly while on a boat and I literally fell out of my seat in uncontrollable laughter. Unfortunately, this was supposed to be a dramatic scene. This movie is simply a total train wreck. I never thought I would see something worse than either Battlefield Earth or Kangaroo Jack...but I was wrong. \"From Justin to Kelly\" is as bad as it gets. It is the worst movie in the history of movies. This truly deserves the #1 spot on the Bottom 100 list here on IMDb. I don't know what else to say, other than that I feel dumber for having seen this film than I did before watching it. Watching a movie this bad is like murder on your brain.",

How unoriginal.  But the songs were OK and I like Kelly Clarkson's voice.  Sure neither her nor Justin are very good at the acting, but it was sort of like watching MTV's spring break at the beach. The large dance and song numbers were entertaining.  I also like Kelly's cute southern accent, although it sounded more like deep Mississippi than Texas.FINAL VERDICT:  I thought it was OK, but they don't need to make another American Idol movie.  So, I recommend it if you liked American Idol the first season and don't mind really cheesy acting and a nonexsistent plot. Basically, if you like music and dance, then you will like this.",

This movie has a lot of really stupid things in it. The guy with the bleach-blonde hair raps at one point. There is a hovercraft-ball game thing to decide a relationship conflict. Toward the end of the movie, Kelly sings a long duet to nobody for about two minutes, although Justin eventually appears. The scenery of the beaches and swimsuits were about the only redeeming qualities to this film. The last song and dance scene is so pointless. This movie is all kind of pointless. Kelly and Justin sing well, but I can't imagine this being a big thing even back when American Idol was relevant. It kind of reminds me of \"Glitter\" but somehow it's even more painful.",

When a movie starts with a screenplay as inept this one, the production usually reflects the writers lack of effort. And so we get From Justin to Kelly, a movie so bad I actually recommend fans of bad movies see it. It's that bad.An example of the unforgivable badness is a scene in which Kelly's ex-boyfriend shows up for no reported reason on spring break from Texas. This upsets Justin, and results in one of the worst scenes ever put to celluloid. The two have a sort of a a hovercraft race on the water with laundry baskets attached to the back of the hover-crafts. It is implied they may be playing a form of basketball in the ocean, with the laundry baskets being the rims. This sort of plot development is intellectually insulting and appalling. And it's not even the worst scene, that's how unremittingly bad this movie is. Surely this was the end of careers and families for people involved. I can't see how an unestablished movie maker could survive their name being connected to this movie. Kim Fuller got the writing credit on this, and already had \"Spice World\" under her belt, along with a string of TV series no one has ever heard of. That's probably the caliber of talent involved with this from top to bottom. Movies like this really are an insult to moviegoers.

Actually \"From Justin to KellY\" (2003) is a fun musical/beach film in the manner of Elvis films and the 60's beach flicks. One look at the movie poster and it's obvious.When viewing films of this ilk it's time to just kick back, turn off your brain and have a good time. On this level \"From Justin to Kelly\" works fabulously. It's pretty much just as good or better than any Elvis or beach movie you can think of. Filmed in the Miami/Ft. Lauderdale area, the story deals with the romantic adventures of youths on Spring Break. Keeping with the traditions of the genre there's no raunch or moronic sex/bathroom humor; the film has an appealing innocence.Another highlight is that there are more gorgeous bikini-clad babes per minute than most movies out there (dudes too, if you're a woman).To be expected, the songs featured are all substance-less modern pop ditties ('modern' as in the early 2000s, which hasn't changed much today). I don't normally listen to this kind of music, but it fits the upbeat and fun vibe of the film.I'm hardly an American Idol aficionado but I admit that I did enjoy the show when I occasionally viewed it with my wife. And Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini, the two stars of the film, were two of the more likable \"idols.\". (I also confess to liking Katharine McPhee, Bo Bice, Carrie Underwood, Chris Daughtry, Kelly Pickler and Clay Aiken). (I'm just joking about Aiken, lol). To be expected, Kelly and Justin aren't the best actors but they're not bad either, particularly as the story proceeds; the quality of the acting certainly doesn't prevent you from enjoying the flick. They did a fine job all things considered.One can't bring up American Idol without mentioning the ever-present Kimberly Caldwell (from the channel station). She's an undeniably good-looking woman but she tends to grate on the nerves. The reason I bring her up is, if you've ever secretly fantasized about seeing her chopped in half, be sure to check out the goofy gorefest \"Wrong Turn 2: Dead End\" (2007) (I'd call it a horror film but it's way too silly and over-the-top to be horrifying). This film makes your fantasies come true, literally.The DVD features the 81-minute fullscreen version of the film whereas as well as the 90-minute extended widescreen cut, which has a few extra dance numbers.If you're in the mood for an innocent beach flick turn your brain off and enjoy!GRADE: B/B-",

The movie must've been written by someone who must be mentally handicapped, cause it well... it sucked. No real plot. The music was poorly dubbed or something. Lip-synching was horrible too, and the acting was pretty bad. Kelly should've stuck to dancing.I hope they don't make a movie with Clay and Ruben, cause, that'll just be sick.

            "content": "(SPOILER WARNING, but as if you couldn't predict it anyway!) It was there, okay! Curiosity killed the cat I guess, but 'From Justin To Kelly' was lent to me by a friend-, as it has not being officially released in Australia! Understandably so, for Australia did not embrace the American Idol series as much as our own version in Australian Idol! Regardless, this notoriously so-called worst of all-time is quite bad, but hard to take seriously as anything than teen-marketed flick for fans of the first American Idol series.The film features two contestants from American Idol in Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini as characters with the same first name. Justin goes to Miami spring break with his two friends, Brandon (Greg Siff) and Eddie (Brian Dietzen) as party and competition organisers and hopefully score some ladies. Kelly is dragged to Spring Break by her two friends, Alexa (Katherine Bailess) and Kaya (Anika Noni Rose), in order to have fun and pick up guys. Eventually, the two groups run into each other, and Kelly has the hots for Justin and vice versa. However, both parties don't want it to be just a fling, Kelly is hindered by her jealous friend in Alexa and Justin's party organising could hinder his chances. Meanwhile, the supporting characters have to find their own love interests. Insert awkward musical numbers here and there, cause after all this film does have two American Idol singers in the title, and then you pretty much have this film.Most of the songs are nothing special, but they are not completely bad either though \"That's the Way I Like It\" was pushing it, but some of the sequences are awkward in its choreography, editing and shot-choice! Sometimes, I had no idea what character was singing in the opening number, cause there were in the distance and surrounded by dancing beach-party goers. However, some nice direction by Robert Iscove added some good touches- particularly in the second main number.I think 'From Justin To Kelly' does have the \"so bad, it's good!\" appeal, and for the most part, the characters were reasonable. I never felt I had to turn it off due to sheer agony, but I did cringe a few times. Some of the acting was off, and the plot was pretty shady, but then again, what do you expect! After viewing, there was no real purpose to characters and no real driving message either. The being in love angle was unconvincing, and Alexa's whole betraying Kelly's trust angle was pretty weak. If anything, the film sort of states that flings are pointless and that you should try to go for something deeper than that! However, the whole purpose of this movie felt like to just hook Justin and Kelly up at the end, ala the title itself and \"art\" imitating life I guess! However, I can safely say that the film beat my expectations as I can safely say I've seen 100 worse films than it! ** Out of *****!",

Just because she was from Texas meant they had to get her to use that GODAWFUL HICK UNBEARABLE accent? Very annoying character.\n2. The setting. I know, I know. It's meant for little 13 year old girls who find the beach, and teen boys idiotic flirting bulls**t to be cute and fun, but come on.. to older girls, meaning 17 and older.. all you can do is gag.. At least that's what I think. All the guys in the film are lame.. NONE of them are cute, especially Justins' friend, when he started singing.. GAHD.. I laughed my ass off! 3. Well, the high point was, Carlos was gorgeous! What was he doing in this movie?? 4. Everytime I heard the \"Oh it won't hurt me a bit\" line in the trailer I cringed... DIDN'T change when I saw the movie. 5. The plot is weak. Anyone could come up with it, and write some dialogue in between just to fill spaces. 6. There should have been a HUGE fight between Kelly and the blonde hick accent girl, and Kelly should have kicked her in the side, ripped her larynx out, and threw her in the pool, then, Justin could go into David Hess' version of \"Wait For The Rain\", from Last House On The Left, and they could end the movie! Yep... That would have saved it... In end, i'm only dissing it because i'm 18, i'm a little to mature to enjoy it. But, to the pre-teens who just think that Justin is hot, and that Kelly's cool, or whatever, go for it. gag.",

This quickly produced tragedy; designed to capitalize on the success of television's 'American Idol' (probably the worst concept in history) was universally panned and tumbled to #8 on IMDb's bottom 100. And rightfully so.MINOR SPOILERS:From the agonizing opening scenes that attempt to establish a 'party' attitude, setting the tone for a 'fun' spring break, to the awful songs (imagine the writers of \"Grease\" went insane), to the insipid use of the word \"party\" to mean \"dance like morons\" (i.e., \"Let's party!!\"), this film just fails on every conceivable level. The leads can't act, the supporting cast is horrendous, the dance numbers are absurd and the direction aimless. But, despite these shortcomings, this film ROCKS!!! It is SO BAD that you can't help but love it for it's sheer crapulence! Chubby ing\u00e9nues Kelly Clarkson will have you chuckling during every scene with her pointless and flat delivery. The director's lame attempts to make Justin Timberlake, resembling Side-Show Bob from \"The Simpsons\", seem party-boy suave will have you keeling over in laughter.The final confrontation between Kelly and her friend who finally admits that she only made a play for Justin out of jealousy is so gut-wrenchingly awful that you can't help but laugh hysterically. Most scenes are not allowed to build up any momentum because the characters' conversations are frequently interrupted by some dork in a bathing suit yelling the afore stated, \"Let's Party.\" And these kids are such a bunch of losers, they listen to this d**k and start dancing in unison! Clearly, the writers didn't have the time and/or talent to draft full scenes, so they just inserted a lot of bad dance numbers to fill in the gaps. Listen, it's easy to make a bad movie. But you really need utter disdain for humanity to subject audiences to this steaming terd. For that reason alone this is a must see!!",

Advice, it's nice to sample other hobbies, but stay with what you do best. As for this movie, for those who honestly think it's good, then good for you and whatever makes you happy. But for me, I don't believe that just because someone can sing a song, think they can also become actors overnight and fool people into thinking they're multi-talented, well reality check, it's not going to happen. I don't blame the actors actually, I know they'd take a laundry commercial or any other extra 5 minutes of fame to help their career take flight.

If not, why would anyone even bother to watch this, in the first place, & expect something substantial!?! If a movie was going to be made with the inexperienced Kelly Clarkson & Justin Guarini (to cash in on their \"A.I.\" popularity) this type of film was a perfect vehicle for their \"talents\". This genre of film is not known for great acting or substantial storylines & that's why they're the perfect leads. I think Justin & Kelly deserve a lot more credit than they have received. One minute they walked in off the street to audition for a TV show & the next minute a huge spotlight is on them. And then they are thrust onto a movie set to star in a film!! For two young virtual nobodies I think they handled themselves pretty well considering the pressure, & overwhelming excitement they must have felt. Yes, they wanted it & they GOT IT FAST!!!!!!!! The movie has it's flaws. Kelly Clarkson is no great beauty, so special attention should have been made to make her appear as pretty as possible. She looks downright homely in some scenes with little or no makeup, unflattering photography, & horrible clothes. She could have looked so much better. Justin is photographed in an unflattering fashion in some scenes too. They also have absolutely no romantic screen chemistry at all. The movie's flaws can be overlooked because it achieves what it strived for: FUN! The music is lively, the dancing is pretty good, there's romance, hot bodies, beautiful Florida scenery & festive colors. This movie is no worse than any other film in this mediocre genre (\"Where The Boys Are '84\", \"Spring Break\", \"Girl Happy\", \"Lauderdale\", etc.) & that's why it should be cut some major slack.",

Despite a complete lack of chemistry (and acting ability) Kelly and Justin apparently fall in love, even though Justin is a party guy, and Kelly is a shy guy. Kelly's friend tries steel Justin away, drama ensues, Kelly confronts friend, drama ends, Kelly and Justin live happily forever after.Now, I understand that a musical movie like this will have a simplistic plot, the focus being on the relationship between the characters and the music but like I said, the relationship between the characters is pretty lackluster and you will be hard pressed to find someone singing along to the music.

Young man meets young woman, both of them sing, they dance badly, other people sing and dance badly, there's a plot shoehorned in there and in the end the two wind up together. You've seen this whole plot before. Honestly there is absolutely nothing new here. But what separates a good version of this story from a bad version is the plot. Well, that and the musical numbers of course. And as somebody who has seen their fair share of musicals I can tell you that this has \"marketing machine\" pasted all over it. This was made to sell a product, namely the whole American Idol thing.Certain things can be forgiven. Justin and Kelly can't act. Neither could Elvis for that matter but he at least had charisma and there's none of that on screen. There's no real chemistry between the leads.

It was simply a fun spring break movie. I will give you this much that I only saw it because I love Kelly Clarkson so much, but when I actually sat down and watched it, it had some alright moments. These moments were mainly between Justin and Kelly, a lot of the other characters were a bit lame such as trying to make Eddie the comic relief, \"why would you have a coffee in the shower\" not funny, but I guess that's the nature of the film. Even though it wasn't made by Disney, it did have a very Disney feel to it, and yes I will concede that the acting is not that of Meryl Streep, however, unlike HSM the cast ranged from good voices (Brian Dietzen) to extraordinary (Justin Guarini and especially Kelly). and I have to say I even enjoyed a couple, such as \"timeless\" and \"anytime\".In conclusion, while the movie may seem a little lame and corny, that's what it is, and it knows it, unlike films like repo : the genetic opera, which try to be serious and are just lame.

Kelly and Justin aren't the greatest actors in the world, but they're still several notches above Mariah Carey in \"Glitter.\" Their willingness to get through the plot with a straight face earns them major points, and, as everyone who voted for either of them on \"American Idol\" can attest, they're just darn likable, and that comes through here as well.The supporting players, to one degree or another, are terrific as well, particularly Katherine Bailess as the witchy spoiled Texas girl and Brian Dietzen as the hot-guy-with-glasses-and-a-hat who we're supposed to believe is a nerd. Dietzen is no Eddie Deezen, but it will be interesting to see him in something where they're not hiding his light under a bushel.If you liked the out-of-nowhere dance numbers that director Robert Iscove tossed into \"She's All That\" and \"Boys and Girls,\" you can get with the goofy vibe here.

The story was so lame. It was trying to be a very cheap (yet the set looks expensive) knock-off of Grease without the emotional connection.Here are the comparisons for Grease. Beach scene and hooking up and trying to hook up in both movies (though Grease was a full year and spent more time in school and KtoJ was a week of spring break).Girl who is manipulative because of insecurities in both. Although Rizzo is a more complicated character than the blond Alexa who at the end of the movie said she was jealous because her girlfriends were hooking up and she wasn't and she doesn't want to be labelled \"Party Girl\" anymore.I had issues with the movie. I was happy, in the beginning, when Kelly was chastising Justin for being an organizer of events that are similar to Girls Gone Wild but she quickly gave it up.And the way that Kelly forgave Alexa (blond) almost instantly because Alexa told the whole truth to Justin allowing their relationship to continue really bothered me. People aren't supposed to manipulate (and she manipulated by setting up her own dates and text messaging her own messages on the phone) with other people's relationships. Offering advice or opinions is one thing but maliciously trying to break the relationship is another thing.The sub-plots were pretty lame too. Kaya (black girl) hooking up with the waiter (Carlos? I think). And internet boy (Eddie? I think) was pretty lame (and I still liked him more than the other characters). The only time I kept laughing was when Officer Cutler (female cop) would keep fining Brandon? but I'm still not happy that they hooked up (even though we saw it coming a mile away).Some of the dance sequences were nice and I did like some of the tunes but that is not going to save the show. The entering of the dance sequences seemed forced and out of place which made me feel uncomfortable watching the movie. (And I normally don't feel that way with musicals or opera).So all in all, I think I'll give this movie about a 3/10. Don't spend money on it. It just isn't worth it.",

As we sat there watching this movie, which is only short the hour and a half mark, we felt as though we were really there on Spring Break. Oh how I wish that spring breaks were really like that. There were a lot of hot girls in bikinis and buff guys showing off their stuff, so it keeps both sexes happy throughout the entire movie. For the synical people out there, go see a movie like \"Forrest Gump\" or \"Saving Private Ryan\" if you're looking for intellectual movies.

            "content": "The first time I saw this, I thought \"what a huge heap of garbage! Poor Kelly!\" But I watched it again.... and I fell in love with it.The opening scene is cute, though the girls reason for taking Kelly to Florida is lame. They could have come up with something better than their \"charter airline went bankrupt and all the other flights were booked\". Seriously.Opening Credits ~ Song: \"Vacation\" by Kelly Clarkson\"The Luv (the Bounce)\" an all cast members dancing and singing jamboree. It's poppy and fun. Kelly looks cute in the scene where she sings to Justin.Cue Brandons Rap -- and the beginning of a series of moments with Brandon and Officer Cutler. A continuing movie theme.Cue \"Forever Part of Me\" - given Justin and Kelly just met, the song doesn't make much sense, but the scene is cute.Clich\u00e9d meeting: Kelly heads to the bathroom, Justin gets harassed by some girls, Justin flees -- into the ladies bathroom. Where Kelly is. Convenient. Funny moment where Kelly helps Justin escape the bathroom and gives him her number, which gets wet and ruined. There are then moments then where the villain of the piece, Alexa, launches into her attempts to keep Justin and Kelly apart. These attempts aren't entirely successful, and Justin and Kelly end up on a boat together. Cue \"Timeless\", where they sing about love. If you're watching the DVD, the commentary is quite amusing at this part of the movie. Kelly makes fun of herself. Justin walks Kelly home, they have an awkward moment, to kiss or not?Kelly is bubbly about her previous day with Justin. Cue \"Brighter Star\". A song NOT in the theatrical release but on the extended edition DVD. One of my favorite songs, and is reminiscent of \"Summer Lovin\" in Grease. The girls dancing is a bit lackluster though. Alexa attempts to convince Kelly that Justin is too different for her. When Kelly doesn't listen, Alexa sets about on another bout of \"destroy Justin & Kelly\".Cue \"Wish Upon A Star\", Alexa's song. Which I think was placed in the movie to make Alexa seem a more sympathetic character. Doesn't really work. Especially given what she does next to her supposed friend!!The next day at Brandons bash, Kelly and Kaya show up and the song \"Madness\" launches. A fun little song, where Kelly and Kaya push lots of guys into the pool. I utterly LOVE Kelly's skirt! Look out for it.Alexa's current plan is currently in motion, and a guy shows up and kisses Kelly, breaking Justins heart. Cue Justins only solo song- \"With Love From Me To You\". Another NOT in the theatrical release. An awesome song, that Justin does well- I have no idea why they cut. Given the movie IS titled \"From Justin to Kelly\" - this song is a love letter, from Justin to Kelly, so should have been included but wasn't.Cue some more nastiness from Alexa. She kisses Justin, lies to Kelly, and sets about wreaking more destruction. Some friend!Kelly and Justin then have a heated argument and part, after which however, Kelly finds out what Alexa did.Cue \"Anytime\", a song from Kelly's first album, \"Thankful\". Nearing the end of the song, Justin arrives with Alexa who tells them what she did and apologizes. Justin and Kelly talk and singing resumes, with Justin singing (the original version of the song is not a duet but I wish it had been- their voices together are something sublime). As the song ends, they kiss. These two have amazing chemistry, the kiss is pretty powerful. Next day is the final day in Florida. We launch into the movies final musical number, \"Thats the Way I Like It\". Much like in \"The Luv (the Bounce)\", each of the respective cast get their own singing line. There is mass dancing. Watch Kelly singing her own line, Kelly dancing with her back against Justin, gyrating in a VERY sensual manner. He pulls back her hair and runs one hand down her arm and holds her hand. It's kind of erotic for a PG13 movie! Makes you wonder if all the rumors of them dating were true. Finally, the song finishes.... The credits launch ... \"Sugar\"; performed by Justin and Kelly. And the movies over!There are many funny moments, the songs are fun. Despite being voted as \"The Worst Movie Musical in 20 years\", I don't think its as abysmal as \"Grease 2\".It's incredibly cheesy, with many deviations from the main story, Kelly is utterly cute, Alexa makes the villain you love to hate, Kaya and Carlos are kind of pointless, as are Eddie and Brandon, but they add their own kooky moments to the story and maybe the movie wouldn't work as well without those little moments. If you can get a hold of the Special Edition DVD watch it with commentary by Kelly, Justin and the director. Lots of interesting trivia and very cute.",

            "content": "Accompanying my teenage children to this film--I never watched even part of an episode of American Idol--I expected to detest it. However, it's really just an update of an old Frankie and Annette beach party movie--or a mid 60s Elvis film--with Justin and Kelly in the roles. As such, it was not bad. The writers wisely chose to use time-tested plot elements and stock characterizations that have worked in B-musicals for decades and still manage to work today. Of course, the music was bad and the dancing was on the level of a 70s Brady Bunch special, but did anyone ever watch a Beach Party movie for the music? I certainly didn't. I watched for the comedy and the personal charm of the stars. Both Justin and Kelly have quite a bit of personal charm, and the supporting cast was just right, playing the slapstick quite well. Although this might not be much of a compliment, I thought this was FAR better than the Lizzie McGuire Movie, much of which was cloying and grating on the nerves. This harmless exercise in fun was just what it promised--85 minutes of silly \"Grease on the Beach\" antics that got me out of the 100-degree Texas heat for a while and left a smile on my face. With no real sexual or r-rated humor, it's also a safe film to take a 10-year-old to see. The fan of 60s Beach Party films, or Elvis films such as GIRL HAPPY, would probably find this piece of corporate product an equally acceptable way of killing 85 minutes. Hey, I'd rather sit through this a second time than ADAPTATION or any PT Anderson film!",

That being said, the opening dance number \"Bounce\" and the closing number \"That's the Way\" were a lot of fun, and more than made up for the ooey gooey not so satisfying middle.  Katherine Bailess who played Alexa was divine.  If there were ever tryouts for \"Dallas: The Teen Years\", she would definitely be a forerunner.

This serious 'relationship stuff' becomes apparent when Justin takes Kelly on a boat ride. The couple is able to sing over the loud motor of the boat, and we're able to see the weather change dramatically from cut to cut. They seem to communicate best when singing. The rest of the movie will not be so easy for them, thanks to one of Kelly's friends, Alexa (Katherine Bailess), the 'good looking' friend. Alexa schemes to undermine Kelly and Justin every step of the way. And as if we we're too stupid to understand that Alexa's character is mean spirited and bad, we get to see her make a fool of herself every so often, just so we can be assured that the karmic movie scale is in balance. This movie may be bad, but Katherine Bailess is a pretty good dancer. She has one pretty decent scene in the movie that plays out like a fantasy sequence. This scene is perhaps the highlight of the film.The other friends come off as 'movie time wasters' and accomplish nothing more than to provide the occasional 'yuk' to the introspective longings in song from Justin and Kelly. You also might expect some sex in a movie that takes place during spring break, but the movie plays out like a 'G rated orgy' on Nickelodeon late night.The only true laugh in the movie comes when Justin challenges another boy (whom he thinks is Kelly's boyfriend) to a hovercraft race on the beach. This idea is borrowed in part from Popeye and Bluto's 'Race to the Moon' episode, or in any Popeye and Bluto cartoon. This hovercraft race wasn't so much a race as it was a jousting match replete with rubber balls in place of a jousting lance.For the most part, I was just waiting for the movie to end. The movie has the ever-popular 'satisfaction guaranteed' ending that American audiences love so much. Each character is brought back together by the end of the movie to be cleaned and tidied. Each character is paired up with a significant other, or if not a significant other, a dancing partner. And as if that wasn't enough, the Movie God decried that everybody must dance. And what better way to go out dancing than to go out dancing to a remake of K.C. & The Sunshine Band's, 'That's The Way I Like It (Uh huh, they really do, Uh huh). Everybody dances in unison, as if Paula Abdul was able to work her Los Angeles Laker cheerleader halftime choreography into the movie. Talk about doing whatever 'Simon Says'.If you had to either read the book or watch the movie, read the book, it hasn't been written yet. Clark Richards",

What did you expect? American Idol promises this: some cute but unknown person will karaoke her and his way into superstardom, based on the votes and comments of the judges and viewers. It's like a deranged form of American democracy, only with more participants and a less damaging pay off if everyone chooses incorrectly. These fledgling stars are then given roles, record deals, you know, things that stars get. So if you wanted a movie about... something... why'd you waste your time with American Idol?! The only thing that wins the attention in this case is the show itself. That and Simon, the world's most famous curmudgeon.This movie, From Justin to Kelly, is EXACTLY what it's supposed to be. In that case, it's successful. Yes, I said it, it is successful at doing what it's supposed to do: showcase Justin and Kelly singing, grinning, and beautiful-being their way across Miami beach for good ol' fashioned American sex-and-consumerism yearly festival (also known as Spring Break). Dialog? Just a tool to get to the next song. Characters? They are their characters! Plot? Remember, American Idol isn't just stupid, it's also paint-by-the-numbers: the kids don't even sing their own songs! You expect a plot from that? What this movie has and has a lot of is hunky guys, scantily clad girls, and choreography. That's why I rate it so high, is it has some damned fine choreography (that and I can actually see why people like Kelly, she is pretty). But rather than reiterate the plusses and minuses that so many people have already detailed about this kitsch-fest, I just want to hammer it to you: You. Voted. For it.

Justin Guarini can't act to save his life but he does better than his two sidekick friends who not only embarrass themselves but the very essence of the people they stand for in the film. Kelly Clarson fairs better but we're not talking Oscar material, she is just slightly better than Guarini and only looks good as an actress because of all the six main characters, her own character has the most class and not to mention depth to her. The best part of the film in the song 'Anytime' which also appears on both Guarini's and Clarkson's debut albums. The song has so much attitude but it still manages to remain romantic.

But sending it the bottom 100 is extreme because there are a couple of good aspects.The Worst: I think what ultimately led to this movie's horrible reputation is the directing. I have NEVER seen a movie with such disjointed, meaningless scenes. It's almost a bunch of random scenes stuck together without any cohesive plot. No transitions, no connecting purpose, just a collage of campy snippets. Also, not even the traditional pause before going into an inappropriate musical number.The Bad: The Screenplay is horrific. Albeit maybe not quite as bad as the directing, the dialogue was SO stereotypical and shallow that it didn't even have an unintentional humorous effect.The Good: These people can sing. I don't see a lot about this in other reviews, but unless you look at something topnotch like Dreamgirls, you won't find many musicals with singers as good as From Justin to Kelly has. If you watched a movie made exclusively for American Idol winners, and expected something OTHER than an excuse for some singing, then I think you have bigger problems than this movie. I mean really, what did you expect? I watched this expecting to hear some singing, and that's what I got. Granted, I got absolutely nothing else, but I think the movie basically met what can be expected of it. Quality singing in a musical is, for me, what saves this from being bottom of the barrel.",

Fox's original plan to issue a DVD three weeks after its release to theatres may had not been a bad idea, and although I liked the film, it may had been better for this movie to go the direct to DVD route and put the 2001 screen opening for a wide release of \"Bend it like Beckham\"If you think you will like it,you most likely will.",

            "content": "I've been curious about this movie for 20 years. I worked in a local video store when it was released; its infamy was immediate. I never had any intention of watching, but as a cinephile there comes a certain point where inquisitiveness overcomes good judgment. 'Ishtar,' 'North,' 'Showgirls' - sometimes you just have to see cinematic notoriety for yourself. Yes, it's a transparent cash grab; yes, Kelly Clarkson has apparently said in retrospect that she knew it was awful, but she was contractually obligated to participate. Yes, the very premise, scenario, and setting scream \"vapid\": a \"musical\" romantic comedy, set during \"spring break,\" which even as a real-life cultural concept is a black hole of intelligence, meaning, value for which anyone should be embarrassed to even live on the same planet, let alone be involved in. Did 'From Justin to Kelly' ever actually have a chance of being any good? Almost surely not. Should anyone ever watch it? Maybe if you're masochistic, or prone to lapses in judgment. Otherwise, no.In kindness, occasionally there might be a scattered line or two that's mildly clever, and one might say that some of the singing is easy on the ears. Some of the choreography, and hair and makeup work, are easy on the eyes - though some of it also plainly inspires a skeptical \"what?\" Beyond these, one must necessarily either pity those who had a hand in this, or despise them. From the ground up Kim Fuller's screenplay is absolute tripe almost wholly bereft of any substance or heart; his work on 'Spice World' was masterful by comparison. Whether one wishes to blame Fuller, editors Tirsa Hackshaw and Casey O. Rohrs, director Robert Iscove, the producers, or someone else or some combination thereof, the pacing is forced and unnatural. The cast are coerced into small, inane, empty corners. The dialogue is rancid and hokey, the characters are obnoxious and hollow, and the scene writing and narrative alike are excruciatingly insipid, inauthentic, and ham-handed, 100% flimsy fluff. Too much of the music is just bland, sterile, soulless refuse. I suppose Iscove's direction is technically sound, and this is otherwise well made from a technical standpoint, but what does that matter?Romantic comedies aren't my favorite genre, but even if they're not perfect they can be earnestly worthwhile: fun, funny, heart-warming, charming. 'From Justin to Kelly' is none of this. It is the opposite of any of this. There was no sincerity in the endeavor from the start, and there is none in the feature as it presents. Whatever value it could possibly claim can be found elsewhere, in far greater quantities, without having to suffer through the vacant, pointless, fruitless, idle nothings. I suppose there are folks out there who might find some kernel of entertainment in this - presumably diehard fans of 'American Idol' or Clarkson - yet given how this is nothing but a cash-in, and how to hear Clarkson sing we have to endure everything else this represents, I have to believe that the feature is altogether insulting even for such fans. Please take the advice of someone who caved in to curiosity and watched a movie she knew would be awful: you don't need to see this. No one does. 'From Justin to Kelly' sits squarely at the bottom of the barrel, and seems to actively try to find its way below even that.Avoid.",

The choreography was neither good nor bad.  Did notice that people were not always in synch with each other.Now on to the acting.  Have to give Kelly the award for WORST actor in this crap fest.  I burst out laughing at her crying scene (no red eyes and obviously someone applied water for the fake tears).  There is another part where her blonde \"friend\" is telling her about how bad Justin is and Kelly replies with one word:  \"WOW.\"  Emotionless and expressionless is a huge understatement.Minor spoiler (not that there's anything to give away here)The hovercraft scene where Kelly tells Justin he doesn't have to play this game.  I thought they were going to play chicken but instead they throw nerf balls or something resembling them into baskets on the opponents hovercraft. WTH?  Fortunately, the scene ends quickly enough with an accident where anyone with any sense would PRAY that it was Justin, but no he survives and hovers to some other beach to contemplate life or something.Days and nights drag on into a timeless hell.  Are they there days, months, years?  Who knows and who cares?  The mindless goes on and on with a cop falling for the troublemaker she keeps ticketing (saw that coming).  The one girl getting her boyfriend of 24 hours fired by bitching at his boss about how unfair he was (where did she get all that information)?Plenty of Grease rip-offs with Kelly attempting (horribly enough) a bad girl scene.

It used to be that writers of pictures, after seeing their great works transformed by the bigwigs into stinkers, would change their names in the credits to Alan Smithee.I think whoever wrote this should do the same.I'm not saying it's all the writer's fault.  It's also the fault of the casting director, the actors (I use the term loosely) the choreographer, the songwriter(s), the director, the producer(s), and the studio.  This failure was a team effort, people.I'm also not saying that Justin and Kelly don't have some talent.  After all, they put up with Simon on American idol.  Anyone who can listen to that dimwit critic wannabe lambaste people (most of whom have more talent than he could ever dream of having) for more than 30 seconds without strangling him deserves some credit in my book (Note:  I don't watch American Idol regularly, but I did catch a few minutes here and there). They just should stick to singing, and leave the acting up to trained professionals like Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affl....(LOOONNNGGG Pause while I laugh uncontrollably...)The acting is wooden.

            "content": "Frankie Avalon is having his coffin built face down in order to save him from having to turn in his grave when the time comes. This horrendously trite, clich\u00e9d, lame and amateurish updating of the type of films that Avalon and Annette Funicello made keeps the relative innocence, but loses all the interest, chemistry and personality. The film also takes cues from \"Grease\", \"Where the Boys Are\" and various empty-headed 1980's teen flicks and every conceivable well-worn stereotype and clich\u00e9d character is in evidence. There are the two destined-to-be-together leads, the manipulative and shallow bimbo, the hardworking older man, the nerd, the jock and on and on..... Clarkson plays what she is, a hometown, singing, bar mistress. Guarini plays close to what he is, a deer-in-the-headlights dullard with a massive head of afro-curls. He also plays a heterosexual party planner. These two each have a set of pals onhand. She has bitchy, troublesome, manhunter Bailess and slightly-less-bitchy, troubled, manhunter Rose. He's got chiseled party boy Siff and hopelessly backward and awkward Dietzen. All of these kids get into romantic entanglements and various unfunny situations, virtually all of which have been seen in many films before. The distinction is that most of their escapades are accompanied by unsubtle, mostly unwelcome musical numbers in which dozens upon dozens of scantily-clad hardbodies try to move in sync with hip-hop motions to bubble gum pop songs while the leads take turns straining their vocal chords as though the \"American Idol\" competition hasn't already come to its conclusion! (In an odd turn of events, some of the dances are time compressed in order to speed up the flailing and the choreography is continually interrupted by insert shots and quick cuts to the point where it often just looks like a mess. One is tempted to say that the film was edited by a chainsaw and, in fact, one of the editors names is Hackshaw!) There are misunderstandings and contrived happenings ad infinitum until the big, splashy ending when the cast gets down to an extended redux of \"That's the Way I Like It\". Connie Francis could NOT act in \"Where the Boys Are\", but she is Meryl Streep compared to Clarkson, who swallows her lines and juts her jaw down in mock indignation. She is given quite possibly the worst makeup, lighting and cinematography of any leading lady since Jane Darwell in \"The Grapes of Wrath\" (and she was SUPPOSED to look like death warmed over!) She often looks downright scary. Guarini and Clarkson share all the romantic screen chemistry of, say, FDR and Hitler. Thank God the film doesn't expect us to believe that they've done anything but kiss! Bailess adds a nice dose of vinegar to all the sappy proceedings and has a fairly impressive dance sequence. Rose (a Tony winner!) is all right. Siff should receive one horsewhip for each line of rap he does. Dietzen can't do anything with his mind-numbingly bad role. Oddly, the best, most realistic performance in the film comes from Yribar as a dejected restaurant worker. This guy is usually only hired to dance, yet outacts everyone else in the film! All of this negativity is not to say that some of the colors and production numbers aren't visually arresting (and there are some beautiful location shots), but the film is just so poor and mindless that it hardly balances out. Finally, near the very end, Clarkson gets a fairly decent outfit, a little make up and a great song that shows where her strengths lie. She should never be allowed to do anything beyond music videos. Guarini (also photographed poorly throughout) sank like a stone after this, though he is planning a comeback sans the fright-wig hair. This takes its place proudly alongside \"The Pirate Movie\" and \"Can't Stop the Music\" as one of the best/worst musicals ever to be produced. Certain to get tackier as the years go by, it should evolve into an uproarious time capsule of the excess brought on by the popularity of \"American Idol\" during the early 21st century.",

In comparison to classic failures such as Plan 9 From Outer Space or Pumaman...FJTK has no right to even be on this list.For me, truly bad movies must have all 4 of the following qualities to be truly bad:1. Ridiculously Bad Script (check! Horrible plot, horrible lines, this movie has it) 2. Ridiculously Bad Acting (check! Wow... no wonder we haven't seen any more of Justin, eh?) 3. Ridiculously Bad Directing (questionable. Considering the stinker of a hand he was dealt, the flow of the movie actually seems fairly decent) 4. Ridiculously Bad Budget (negative. This is no \"Titanic\" or \"Batman\" in budget, but at least the location is real, the sets are real. I'm talking about cardboard box sets.)Example: XXX:State of the Union = Horrible Script, Horrible Acting, Horrible Directing, Huge Budget = A good 3 or 4.Using my chosen, subjective criteria, FJTK merits a good solid 4. In the case of it being a musical, I might add a requirement for Ridiculously Bad Singing, which may be the films only saving grace: at least the vocals are in key!If you want a good laugh and want to see a truly deserving, horrifically, ridiculously bad, worst movie of all time, see Troll 2. It hasn't garnered the attention that the Mystery Science Theatre films have, but Troll 2 is definitely the most deserving of any movie I've ever seen.Please give From Justin to Kelly the 3 or 4 that it deserves.

Don't get me wrong; it wasn't a big, moving experience either.I suspect that the majority of the negativity towards this movie is from the American Idol backlash.

These same people that believe that Korn, Slipknot, Death Cab for Cutie, and yes even the beloved Nirvana aren't/weren't complete commercial whores are just way too cute and naive with their greasy hair and black clothes. I saw James Hetfield of Metallica singing the praises of a Celine Dion song on VH1 the other day, but I digress.) Anyway, there were fun-ish parts to the movie. Plenty of eye-candy for both guys and girls. Katherine Bayliss was smoking hot. The music ranges from off-key to really nice (I particularly loved the version of Kelly's \"Anytime\" which is also on her first CD.) Lots of good choreography.

This show was highly talked-about and highly watched every other night in the Spring of '03.I remember when it was between Kelly Clarkson (from Burleson, Texas; yee-haw!) and some guy from Pennsylvania. I remember seeing this on the news and each of their respective high schools were cheering on! And guess who won? Kelly did! She won the $1 million record contract and became a real pop star! After that, some guy named Justin won the second \"American Idol.\" This movie is what happens when you take each of the first two winners of that show and make a movie out of it. It may look bad, but it's cool enough. Besides, they are very good when it comes to music!",

Many of us are better aware of Kelly Clarkson than Justin Guarini here. At least from what I know. Anyhow, I managed to catch it once before here on cable and despite what I had heard so much about the movie, I still watch it because I do like Kelly and her music.So it all started out as two group of youngsters (Justin's and Kelly's friends) were heading to the beach for some fun time. But never did Kelly realised that Justin do like her. But, one of Kelly's friends, being the jealous one tries to separate the two of them. Well, what happens in the end is just about as predictable as anyone can think.I do like the songs being used in the movie. Very fun and light-hearted, you know. Nothing wrong with that.I am aware when this movie was released, it had never made its way here. I don't know, maybe given the general reaction back in the States.

Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guardini play themselves, and that's too bad, they aren't interesting enough to have a movie based on their own characters.

But getting to the subject at hand: why was this, this THING made in the first place? Oh that's right, because everyone loves Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini. Yes, I'm sure they'll both be remembered 3 years from now for their stellar performances in this schlock fest. Where do I start, really? The story is nonexistent, the characters are woefully underdeveloped (Horny Capitalist, Internet Dork, Souther Witch, Sassy Black Gal), and the musical numbers are just a tad bit forgetable. The only one I can remember right now is the song \"That's The Way I Like It,\" and that's only because it was a song before this movie ever came out. Plus, FJ2K can get pretty bizarre. For example, the fact that the audience has to watch Internet Dork peel his sun burnt skin off for more than 5 seconds. Uh, can we say YUCK boys and girls?! Then there's the dinner in the half drained pool (it looks even more idiotic in person), the musical number in the bar from a bad Star Trek episode, and the fact that Spring Break has been turned into nothing but an alcohol-free, Mickey Mouse Club version of its true self. And do I even have to mention the hovercraft showdown? Yeah, because so many people have hovercrafts at Spring Break. BOGUS! Then there's the fact that there are way too many side characters, like Luke, your standard Texan Cowboy who wears his cowboy hat to the beach, and The Spicy Mexican Love Interest named Carlos (yeah, that's not a generic name). Sorry, I knew what I got myself into with this movie, and it surely did not disappoint. Now I have the top 3 worst musicals ever made: 3) Jekyl and Hyde, 2) FJ2K, and 1) Can't Stop the Music. .5/4 stars",

I must have dozed off after the \"officer Cutter\" scene. Though I liked \"Harley Davidson & the Marlboro Man\"; seen it many times on satellite in 25 years as a matter of fact. Furthermore Tom Sizemore, Alec, Billy, and Daniel's big brother were actually plausible villains in that Don Johnson / Mickey Rourke likewise plausible \"reluctant, but worthy tandem heroes\" flick. Moreover HD & the MM is a hell of a lot better movie than this J to K stinker; I seen enough of the latter to rate it a 3 rather than 1 because to be fair I failed at staying awake; so that much I can tell you. Otherwise i'll have to ask my wife, and get back to you for a \"Justin to Kelly\" review. Better yet don't even waist your time just checkout the aforementioned Johnson, Rourke, Sizemore, and Baldwin flick instead. Or porn; heck any porn rates at least a 5 by default.

This beach musical is the equivalent of creating a new species of dinosaur just before the meteor hit. On a lighter gear, the film is a mighty shame. Kelly Clarkson actually has a great voice and seeing her newly budding career potentially go down in flames is a little hard to watch.

Then there are movies that are so bad they're funny (ie. The Core, Blue Lagoon), and then there is From Justin to Kelly. It is in a league of it's own. The absolute pits of Hollywood flops. If I didn't feel the need to warn humanity of this movie, I would not be writing this review right now.Kelly and Justin (aptly named) are two college-age partiers who are not your typical college-age partiers. They are looking for true love, not just promiscuous sex. Kelly is a non-aspiring singer from Texas, and Justin is a frat boy/dancer/heartthrob with two truly obnoxious friends. They're made for each other, right? Erm, sort of.The problem is, Kelly's blonde friend is secretly in love with Justin, and engages in a covert sabotage of their relationship by giving Justin her phone number as Kelly's. Justin thinks, then, that he's sending Kelly text messages. But really, he's sending them to the jealous blonde friend, who does everything in her power to nip the relationship at the bud. (Interestingly, Justin never tries to call the cell phone, and he and Kelly never discuss the text messages. Convenient, huh?) But, as could be predicted, true love finds a way to prevail.Sometimes musicals become awkward when put on screen. Rent, for example, or West Side Story. Other times, they become travesties. All of the songs, save for the first one, are awkward sorts of mental reflections. They are sung out loud, but only sort of. Quite often, in fact, Kelly and Justin have duets that they are both singing inside their heads, yet synchronized. Get it? Me neither.I think my brain will bleed if I force myself to try to dissect this movie further. This movie is not like a train wreck. You literally have to force yourself to watch it.

I was expecting a slightly better movie, i knew it probably would be bad, but watchable, but, it was so bad, after the 1st couple songs, i hit the eject button.2 thumbs down, if i had a 3rd hand, i'd give it 3 thumbs down. Even if i was paralyzed from the neck down, i'd probably manage to give this movie 2 thumbs down.",

This movie was made in 2003, so many people are huge critics of the time and they did not understand importance movies like this played for films such as high school musical, and other \" talentless\" films. Costumes of the time reflect the careless free feeling we all had during the early 2000's. It's sad to see people critique this movie so hard, it's a cheesy movie that was meant to be that way.

He has such presence, I found myself wishing him to be in every scene. I look forward to the DVD where they will hopefully put in deleted scenes.

She and Justin are good friends, and that shows through the film. If you like either Justin or Kelly, I recommend that you go to see this film. I do, however, find it frustrating that they keep \"just missing\" each other, like when they are looking for each other in the crowd at the beach and keep looking just beyond the other person, but that, is just one of the films subtle charms because it makes you even happier when they finally straighten everything out between each other and end up together. The music is great, too! At least one of the songs are from Kelly's new album. So if you haven't seen this film, I highly recommend that you do!!!!",

Justin is a better actor than a singer, but that's not saying much.

My son died and went to heaven when the oil tanker blew up at the end and Justin and Kelly fought the terrorists in a mind-numbing space battle over Mars.

The dancing was well choreographed (especially the 'Wish Upon A Star'segment) and the singing was above average (of course Kelly Clarkson is the true star in this department). Every one of the six main characters shows remarkable talent.As far as acting goes, the best performance comes from Justin Guarini, who gives his character a certain realistic quality whereas Kelly comes off a bit dramatic and everyone else appears too caricatured. Even so, the acting never gets any worse than what you might find in an episode of Saved By The Bell, so it won't ruin your enjoyment of the movie.The story is simple but it works. Too much drama and plot would not work for the Spring Break setting, where everyone is just looking for some lovin'.If you're still unsure about this movie, just take the risk and rent it.

            "content": "This week, i finally got to experience the dread of 'From Justin to Kelly' myself, when it aired on Norwegian cable-TV. I was fully aware that the 'musical' got nailed pretty badly at the Razzie awards, and that it, according to the voters of IMDb, was one of the most awful movies ever made. I was actually looking forward to watching it, because I have this strange sense of humor; sucky movies tend to REALLY crack me up.As i anticipated, the 'musical' was... not very impressive (phenomenal understatement). It sucked, as a matter of fact. The plot was VERY poor: The story was set in sunny Florida, during the notorious American spring break. The non-charismatic, sucky actor Kelly Clarkson and the non-charismatic sucky actor Justin Guarini (who, of some reason, has remained pretty obscure in Norway) have the lead roles. They appear to be quite different from each other, but still connect in very fascinating way (minor sarcasm). Of course, they come together in the end, despite all odds... On the way, we witness backstabbing, low-browed humor, DEPRESSINGLY bad actors, and, naturally, a lot of not-so-impressive (another understatement) dance numbers. It's just so sad that the movie fails even at points a musical REALLY SHOULD be decent, such as singing and choreography. The choreographer actually 'won' a special Razzie award for his work. The songs are either crap or average pop music.The cast is hopelessly talentless. We are presented both a blond,deceiving and irritating slut from the South, and a geeky computer enthusiast with glasses and not-up-to-date beach clothes. These two, and all the other members of the supporting cast are among the most terrible I have ever seen.About the director... Let's just say he's not quite in the top league.The script of this movie was horrid, so horrid that I just sat there with a bad taste in my mouth. It was full of clich\u00e9s, unintelligent 'comedy' (is really the geek's sunburns even slightly amusing?), and not-very-significant dialog. It's standard at its very best moments.Damn it! I hoped for a FUNNY cinematic disaster, not this hopeless piece of junk. Yeah, it's more or less an atrocity, but I will not slaughter it in the the same fashion as many other IMDb users, that is, by sentencing it to the very pit of movie history. 'From Justin to Kelly' doesn't deserve to be among the bottom tens. It's a turd, no doubt, but I know several examples of movies where the film crew were even more clueless and the final result was even more devastating. Take 'Manos: The Hands of Fate' and 'Troll 2'. Pure garbage. I will therefore, very generously, give this movie two stars.Not surprisingly, the only cinematic spin-off product of 'American Idol' was a failure. Being aimed at the female pre-teens of America, it couldn't end any different: a moronic, immature, and superficial chick-flick. Jesus! Thankfully, 'From Justin to Kelly' can easily be avoided in the future. At least here in Norway.",

I admit I was only able to see (stomach) bits of it but if the parts represent the whole, this movie is of quality lower than what you have likely encountered anytime before.After coming to grips with how amazingly bad this was, I was more shocked to learn that this had a theatrical release! They actually released this into the cinema. We do not watch a lot of TV, and hardly (never) watch shows like American Idol. Having never seen it, and having seen Justin and Kelly act in this tripe, it's safe to say (at least to myself) that this show will never make my list. The script, the acting, plot, the clich\u00e9s, set production are all of the lowest quality. It's unbelievably bad.I'd like to make some comments on the rating it receives here. It has a 1.7 rating (1.0 being the absolute worst on a scale of 1-10). ~76% of the people rate it 1.0 (aweful). ~6% of the people rate is a 2 or 3. ~3% of the people rate it between 9 and 4. ~12% of the people rate it a perfect 10. OK, here's where I am convinced that the rating system is uncontrolled for people who are 1) out of their minds, 2) pranksters, or 3) think that a 10 is a 1 and visa versa.This movie conforms to the lowest standards; don't waste your time on it.",

I had to beg my sister and best friend to come with me. Though they say that they hated the movie, it didn't take me too long to convince them to see it in the first place. They are probably closet J2K fans. But they arent review this, I am, so who cares what THEY thought?Okay so the second time I seen this movie was about three weeks ago. I rented it because I was bored and needed to make fun of something. It was between J2K and Gigli. I am not a strong enough person to watch Gigli for the first time alone. Especially not when there are sharp, blunt objects around that I could hurt myself or the tv with.But back to the movie. I rented it and was home alone and put it on. I was shocked to say the least. I actually didn't HATE IT. It was better than I remembered it being in theaters.I had to do a project for my Post Production class and was going to do a music video tribute to the three worst musicals ever made that I actually LIKED. Those three: Grease 2, J2K, and Crybaby.In order to do this I needed to rewatch J2K again to see what parts I wanted to use. I must say that after the third viewing, I love this movie.It was so stupid. The dialogue is pretty bad, most of it is VERY unlikely to EVER happen and a lot of the acting is just plain bad. But the music is good and it doesnt really drag. In other words, I've seen A LOT worse movies. (cough) SCOOBY DOO (cough).The thing that I really didnt consider the first time I seen this was, Justin and Kelly are NOT actors. They werent on \"Acting Idol\". I can't really say anything bad about their acting because they are NOT actors and this movie proves that.So, for those of you who gave this a ONE STAR, I suggest you rewatch it again. This is the type of movie you CAN'T take seriously. Overall I gave this movie an 8. It was interesting and I certainly wasn't bored while I was watching it.I didn't take any points off for acting because like I said they are NO actors.I took off 1 point for the fact that this would NEVER happen, ever.I took off 1 more point for the fact that this is a musical, yet there is no cd soundtrack. Bad move Fox.Final thoughts: LIGHTEN UP, PEOPLE! This isn't like Gigli where they were honestly trying to make a good movie and it failed. This is NOT a serious movie. Give it another chance!",

Maybe it was the choreography which actually rivalled decapitated chickens running around while they were high on crack. Or maybe the plot. Oops! There wasn't on. My mistake. I also like the completely random hovercraft competitions that, as we all know, always take place on beaches during spring break. Or the cop. Man, someone was on acid when they cast her as the \"beautiful\" police officer. And I just loved that anorexic, evil blonde, who spilled her guts (whats little of them) to Kelly at the end. Or maybe it was the acting. I mean, even half-retarded babies with no arms couldn't act better than half of these guys. And that clever blonde. After all, she was pretty smart to manipulate Justin like that. As we all know, if you really like a girl, everybody knows you can't call her. That's lame. No, no, you have to text message her on a number that her suspicious friend gave you. And, man, Justin's friend who kept throwing those parties. Where does he come up with such good ideas, because he throws the most original parties, too. After all, who hasn't heard of a whipped cream bikini contest. Or a pool party. Really, where does he get those ideas? And Carlos. Man, the emotion on your face convinced me, especially when you said you should have quit your job a while ago. Yup, that emotion sure did the trick. To best sum it up, the emotion you possessed was only outmatched by the emotion of a dead seal. Yes, I loved this movie.

            "content": "SPOILERS Prior to seeing this \"movie\" (it in fact featured moving pictures so I suppose it qualifies), I heard the hype in both directions.  I'm not one for musicals but I understand their concept and how they're generally supposed to work.  This wasn't a musical.  This wasn't a teen movie (everyone but the lead actress looked well over the age of even the oldest, dumbest, college kids), this was clear right off the bat.So maybe it has a serious plot, you know, the kind that tugs at your heart strings.  Nope, can't have any of that, no time, there's singin' to do! First, the movie kindly shoves everyones' roles down our throat, so we won't forget when the music numbers end.  We've got our hero, Justin, the ex-party animal.  The guy who gets ticketed at the end of each song (I don't remember his name, see how important he was to the plot?), and the Internerd who strangely has no shame in telling everyone he's looking for his cyber girlfriend groan.  The 3 girls are pretty predictable, we have the stupid slut who gets caught doing something stupid, the smart one who does something stupid (getting mixed up with a 35 year old, bus boy, stereotype thing qualifies as stupid), and the ugly one we feel sorry for who tries to be the cute one in the end.I did manage to sit through this one (on sheer will power) and don't remember rolling my eyes so much in one movie in all my life.  The movie lacked character development, character substance, any form of a realistic plot, and in general featured the type of acting I'd expect from a skit by Christopher Walken on Saturday Night Live (you know the kind, eyes glued to the cue cards, wishing it would just end)There was some action, though.  I was pleased to see the adventurous use of the hovercraft.  When the guy fell off and got sucked under the machine, part of me was hoping that was good old Justin under there, gasping for air. At that point I began to day dream a little, wondering what the world would be like if there in fact was an accident on the set during the shooting of this scene and he did fall off and get sucked under... I was brought back to reality seconds later when the ticket guy received another fine (comic relief, after all, that was a serious life-or-death issue they just addressed, the audience needs a little chuckle to recover).  Why didn't the movie just throw the guy in jail, he's clearly got on social conscience and is a habitual criminal.  I say we throw the book at that.. whatever.Bad movie, even if you like the singing performances those two put on during the American Idol shows (I'm not much of a fan of that style of music). I don't see the logic in the choices of songs given the scenes in which they were used.  The boat incident.. she's about to puke and they launch into song?  What's the deal with them screaming in each others' faces?  That's a bit on the creepy side if you ask me.  I know when I sing a duet with someone I'm courting, and barely know, I try my hardest to keep from yelling in their face.  Maybe they get off on that sort of thing, I don't know. They're clearly both into some seriously screwed up long-distances relationships with stalkers they barely know (yes, they both classify as stalkers in my book).  Someone at 20th Century Fox really screwed up when they cleared the script on this one.",

Kelly has that powerful voice. Justin has been offered roles on Broadway, tv and movies because of the exposure on this film. And Kelly's cd has gone double platinum and she's now breaking internationally. SO I don't understand the bashing of these two talented performers. A lot of reviewers admit that they haven't even seen the movie. How sad.  Kelly and Justin are not just the two people who appeared on AI.

Most of the girls bend over and shake their asses, while the guy's all whip off their shirts and decide to go dance with each other. Of course, no movie would be complete without a villain. A stupid slutty villain. A stupid slutty villain who is forgiven for being a stupid whore at the end. WTF? Here, there is this girl, and she is screwing with Justin and Kelly for no damn reason. Then, she steals one of their phones, and tells one of them that she is Kelly, and that she hates him. Of course, at the end, they all become best friends long enough to \"Dirty dance\". Of course, if you haven't figured it out by now, this movie was total trash. Perfect MST3K fodder. If the show hadn't been canceled, this would have definitely been in their lineup. Of course, the most grueling part of the movie was when Justin and Kelly would just decide to sing. Something would be happening, and of course, one of them would burst out in a song where they rhymed love with love. 1 out of 10 purely because of the honestly hard attempts on the part of the supporting actors to do well.",

Whoever wrote the screenplay should quit their job because they obviously can't write. Now this movie also really had a bad plot. It wasn't creative at all. It was probably one of the worst decisions of Kelly's life to act. I don't believe I waisted my time watching this movie. In 2003 I was kind of excited to see this movie. If the genre was comedy why wasn't their anything funny in it. The script was so unwell written. My recommendation is to never in your life watch this movie because you will regret it. There no doubt that Kelly can sing that's why she won American Idol but she is probably the worst actor I've ever seen. It wasn't entirely her fault, her lines weren't creative at all. I thought every actor in this movie did a terrible job, same with the directors and everyone else. I just thought this was a disgrace.",

The Star Trek reference involving this character is quite hilarious, possibly the most amusing part of the movie. As for the musical numbers, they are more enjoyable than your typical Disney songs, and one or two are above average-but nothing comparing to most of the selections on your local Oldies station. The cinematography is bright, which is another plus. It does slow down at times, and there are some sexual references that are surprising for a PG (G in Canada) rated movie.

And I'm not dissenting with the popular opinion just to be an iconoclast or a nonconformist. I watched it on ABC Family this weekend (I'm assuming there wasn't much to edit out for TV), and really, the movie isn't any worse than most other teen/spring break pictures out there. Are the musical numbers painful to watch? Unquestionably. Is the script recycled from any other movie set on a beach? Let's just say it's not too original. Has a \"game\" involving hovercraft jousting and big puffy balls been played anywhere on Earth outside of this film? I'm thinking no. BUT -- are critically-minded, possibly jaded adults the target audience here? DEFINITELY NOT. One must always consider that. The film has all the \"requisite\" elements of a spring break pic: the girls, the guys, the dancing, the clubs, the beach, the scheming, the hookups, the eventual reconciliations. The music does devalue the movie enormously, but the intended audience ain't gonna care or notice. Honestly, I doubt the producers/director cared or noticed. Or maybe the scheming best friend reminded me of a girl from Kentucky I once dated . . . their voices sound EXACTLY the same . . . My vote: 4/10",

But still...although I might be biased towards the movie but I love her, this does not make much of a difference. Some people complained that no one in real life would just break out in song and dance and everyone would go along with you. Well for one thing, most movies today are NOT real life at all, and besides...it's a musical. Plus, I dance. We all randomly break out in song and dance. Anyway, I thought the movie was adorable. True, in some places you're wondering...why is this here?...but the overall theme and plot is cute. I've watched it many times, and I still love it more and more. I think the singing is wonderful, and makes the movie really interesting. I'm shocked that they didn't make a soundtrack...because what kind of musical doesn't have a soundtrack?!! Also, I think Kelly and Justin have good chemistry on screen, especially at the end. So personally, I'm in love with this movie. It's one of my favorites. It's an upbeat, perky, and just good-time movie that I can always watch to jump and dance around with. I'd give it 10 stars!",

American Idol's first season went well, so maybe the producers just thought, hey, let's make a few extra bucks! The plot is, of course simple. A girl named Kelly and her two friends come to Miami for spring break. At the same time Justin and his two friends come to the same place. Justin is a huge party animal, and Kelly is a sweet innocent virgin (don't ask how I know she's a virgin...I'm only assuming). But when they see each other, they fall loopy in love. The only thing that's keeping them apart is Kelly's friend, a blonde back-stabbing slut (forgot her name) who lies to them both to get them mad at each other. and it works. And then Kelly and Justin fight, but the blonde one confesses and apologizes for what she did...then Kelly and Justin make up, they start singing, then they kiss. The kiss wasn't great though, it was just boring and I found myself yawning through it. It wasn't passionate at all, and they have ZERO on-screen chemistry.The songs were bubble-gum pop, and especially with Kelly and Justin's voices, it made them horrible. The dances were cute though, not amazing, but cute. There were some unrealistic parts, like, why were there only thin young girls in their bikinis and big buff young guys on the beach? No kids? No parents? No old people? And even if I did believe in love at first sight, did it really seem real for Justin to see Kelly once and think she's so special? He barely even took a good look at her, he just saw a glance of her when Brandon mooned in front of her and her friends....then he fell in love?Overall, this movie was predictable. But I think for any American Idol fans who especially like Justin and Kelly, it's enjoyable, so I'm giving it a 3.",

It was confusing to have \"wholesome\" dialogue juxtaposed with girls in string bikinis or whipped cream bikinis even.  Justin and Kelly did have a decent chemistry, but they weren't on screen together enough to develop it and give them a reason to be together besides love at first sight. The absolute worst scene was where Justin and a guy from Kelly's home town (Luke?) go against each other in hovercrafts.  Hovercrafts sound kind of cool, right?  Well, not when the fight over Kelly consists of throwing what they called \"beanbags\" (which looked like regular inflated balls to me) into each others laundry baskets in the crafts while racing past each other. It was ridiculous, much like the rest of the movie.  Let's hope Justin or Kelly can get a decent script next time.",

This is the best song you could find for the dance finale?  The real bright spot was the singing, dancing, and acting of Kelly Clarkson.  She is a great singer, an okay dancer, and an authentic presence on the screen.  With the right role, a decent script, and some experience, Kelly could be a fine actress and movie star.  She could start with adding a song or two to a movie with a cameo role.",

SPOILERS AHEAD\"From Justin to Kelly\", publicized as a \"Grease\" for the new millennium, features the two winners from the first season of \"American Idol\", Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini. Justin and Kelly, playing college students on Spring Break, find true love in Florida despite the pressure to hook up with random people and Kelly's meddling best friend.This movie plays into stereotype after stereotype: Justin's player friend looking to make money and lust after women, Justin's nerdy white-boy friend looking for his internet girlfriend, Kelly's friend who falls in \"love\" with a local busboy (a la Love Story), Kelly's hoochie friend who tries to steal away any man she can find. On top of the one-dimensional characters, the plot does not help either. Kelly and Justin have trouble getting together because of Kelly's scheming friend Kaya. Ooooooh noooo! But in the end, \"fate\" wins out, and the two Idols can be together and profess their love, until it's time to PARTAY, spring break style!!!!Clearly, the plot/characters were not the initial hook to the movie. The music and the singing were supposed to be.The music/singing, sadly, did not help any. All the songs sound alike, and despite Clarkson's talent, not even she could save the movie.All of the critics and the general public were right. This movie is NOT worth it. My recommendation is to just rent \"Grease\" instead.",

The director, lead actors, choreographer and producer are all retarded and the human race is far worse off for introducing this plague upon mankind. The songs were horrible, boring, and awkwardly timed. The film work was pitiful. Anyone that knows anything about cinema knows what will happen next in the movie before it happens. It is predictable, and I cant believe what passes for entertainment today. Anyone that gave this movie over a 1 star needs to be beaten silly with a piece of lumber. This movie might be entertaining for young kids, However, there are a lot of provocative dancing sequences, mature dialog, and more wannabe party teen plot parts. So this movie isn't for kids, and it isn't for anyone with an Iq over 25. Please I implore you to avoid this movie, even if there is only one station working on your TV - please don't watch this... bang your head into the wall, it will make more sense, be more fun, leave you with less of a headache, and you will feel like you accomplished more doing that than watching this useless piece of Hollywood trash trying to make money off of those poor souls that watch Idol. If you are an evil dictator or a terrorist then this movie is good to torture your subjects or those you wish to terrorize - so quit bombing things, starting wars, and beheading innocent people - just start showing this movie.",

But, come on, who doesn't love a good corny movie every once in a while? Its so bad its good!To give an example of one of those predicable scenes: Justin and Kelly are on a boat. They sing \"Timeless.\" Corny lines follow. There ARE good aspects to the movie, though. For instance, the dancing is EXTRAORIDINARY. The choreographers are quite good, and the dancing is fun and interesting to watch. The singing--well, the songs are undeniably pop, but, as I said, they're catchy. Yes, they WILL get on your nerves after singing them OVER and OVER and OVER without knowing the real words to the song, but you'll remember them for weeks. \"From Justin to Kelly\" is just a guilty pleasure. Sure, its pretty bad. But there are tender moments, great dancing, and songs that stick in your head. And who doesn't mind watching a fun, spring break beach movie?",

Once the moment it came out - simply because I believed that one day I was going to marry Justin Guarini, or at least be able to touch his hair. The second time was a few days ago, only because I couldn't remember what had happened. I've seen reviews on this movie and decided that there is one thing all those reviewers have in common - they were taking the movie way too seriously.This movie is a fun film, about spring break, music,and romance. It's not meant to be taken seriously. I highly doubt that Justin and Kelly made this movie with the intent to send this wonderful message about love or whatever - They did it to have fun, and you could easily tell that both people were having a lot of it on screen.If you're going to watch this movie - be prepared for a shaky, simpleton plot. The reasons I can give for someone to see this movie - the amazing voices of both leads - along with the many, many scenes of shirtless men and scantily clad women.Older people find this movie boring, pointless and unbearable, because they crave a substantial, memorable plot and wonderful acting. Children will not like this move either, for they see no point in it. This movie is best for pre-teens and teens, those who dream of Spring Break and those who've experienced it.Also, the same group will most likely enjoy it for the fashion extremes - at times hitting a great peak, and then failing miserably. Like the ensemble on Kelly during \"That's The Way I Like It\" - which was one of it;'s high points, in my opinion, along with her friend Kaya's sunset colored bathing suit. Then there are moments of failure, such as the outfit on Kelly during \"Anytime\", which in my opinion made her look stout, and the makeup was for it was much too...purple.As a last note - this movie wasn't horrible or wonderful. I give it a four out of ten, the only reason for it not being a five is my distaste for scenes where everybody breaks out in song and dances in sync - because, you know, they didn't rehearse that or anything, they can just read each other's mind. =P",

            "content": "This movie is the most amazing movie i've probably ever seen for the last 15 years i've been living. I love musical movies! & having two amazing singers in it that are very talented in acting, dancing, & in singing made the movie even better. They made this movie in my state FLORDIA! & the shooting was an hour away from where i leave i think thats really cool. All of the dances were AMAZING! & very entertaining i watch them over & over again & all of the outfits Kelly were were beautiful the movie was so good! i watch it at least 5 times every night! i hear a lot of people don't like it but thats because they don't understand it. If you like the beach, singing, dancing, drama, Justin & Kelly then you will for sure like this movie with out a doubt! its a great movie even though it came out 4 years ago i still believe that its the greatest movie yet! & i wish they could make another one! i love it its my all time favorite movie.",

My husband liked it too. Of course he has a \"thing\" for Kelly Clarkson. He can listen to her sing for hours. The music, choreography and the story line was superb. You have to remember, before AI, these kids were virtually unknown. Kelly and Justin were having fun. Period! I was hoping that Ruben and Clay would do a movie. Even Fantasia and Diana. I am looking forward to hearing more about these American Idols in the future.I was surprised and disappointed when I heard that RCA had dropped Justin. Are they crazy?",

All i have heard was what a terrible movie this was and i believed it until i watched it. This is a wonderful movie. It is great movie and i enjoyed it a lot. I wish i had bought this movie earlier so i could have been enjoying it through the cold winter months. I think this is one of the better movies ever made. Some of the other movies that all you people say are so great are nothing compared to this movie. So i would truly recommend watching this movie because it was some of the best 80 minutes in my life. So go out there and buy this movie so you can watch it over and over again and i bet that you will!!!!!!",
