            "content": "Juni Cortez is no longer with the OSS and is now a private detective, taking work where he can get it.  However, the President himself requests Juni return to service as his sister is in danger.  She has entered, and become trapped in, a deadly video game called Game Over which has been designed by the Toymaker.  In it he ensnares children's minds forever.  Juni is sent in to rescue her and team up to stop the Toymaker's evil plot.  Enlisting his grandfather's help, Juni sets out to win the unwinable level 5.I usually don't enter a film series in the middle simply because it is often difficult to appreciate the third instalment of anything without having seen what has gone before.  However, when it comes to a kids' film, I was pretty sure that I could managed to battle through the labyrinth-like plotting of the Sky Kids series!  I started watching this film in 3-D (I had a 2 dvd set) but the glasses were a little uncomfortable and the colours looked funny all the way through.  After seeing a few items sort of float vaguely around my television I was quite unimpressed and decided just to go with the 2-D disk.  The plot is pretty thin (it's never really clear what the attraction of the game is or what the Toymaker even wants) but it sets up a colourful and enjoyable little ride through a computer game - which is delivered pretty well despite all it's silliness!The main weapon in the Spy Kids' cannon is it's stars - both actors and director.  Rodriguez is a very good director when it comes to style and action and his influence makes this film a lot more fun than others likely would.  He is slick but also fully aware that he needs to make it `fun' and not just colourful and noisy.  It's all a bit silly of course but the 3-D gimmick is a little bit heavy at times (like the old films in the 50's that had actors punching at the screen) but it isn't that bad.  The reason the silliness doesn't really damage the film is because the actors seem to play to it - and a very fine series of performances these are.  Pretty much all the cast are good fun and their performances are about as hammy and fun as you can imagine.  Sabara is great fun - a cool kid without any of the horrid cutesy stuff that can happen.  I found Vega less fun as she was a little too smart for my liking, but she was still fun and the rest of the kids were suitably fun with not a bad performance between them.  The adult cast will provide much of the fun for the adults watching - there is a large number of Rodriguez regulars in the cast who all overplay to suit the sense of fun the film has.Montalban is great fun. Forever Khan in my mind, he has a great voice and screen presence and he heavy makes the message of forgiveness work reasonably well and not just being mawkish like it should be! Stallone hams it up and has good fun even if his multiple personalities don't totally work.  Clooney has fun in his small role but the rest of the cast are all cameos some of them are used pretty well and got a giggle but others just show their faces.  However, they don't detract from the film and it at least will amuse parents to see people like Martin, Trejo, Cumming, Shalhoub, Buscemi, Paxton, Wood and Hayek.  The out takes at the end made me realise how good the performances were - it just never dawned on me that, although I knew it wasn't real, that 95% of this was shot on greenscreen - making acting to anything that little bit harder.Overall, this is a silly film but it is one that kids will love.  The sheer sense of fun that Rodriguez brings to it is infectious and makes for a great 90 minutes with the kids.  The star cast made it more enjoyable for me and helped the sense that everyone was just enjoying themselves.  It is hardly a great film but it does just what you expect it to do and who can ask anymore than that? On the basis of this I will definitely be watching the first two films when I cross their paths. Sad - but true!",

            "review_title": "fun for the little ones, but the series is getting stale",
            "content": "Get your little ones ready for the game of their lives, cuz `Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over' will tickle their little bitty funny bones. This third installment of the popular `Spy Kids' series is like its predecessors in that it's high-tech, high-energy, high-fun, and high on the pro-family moral messages. What's more, it's in 3D, which requires disposable glasses, handed out at the theater. On the downside, the Spy Kids theme seems worn out, the actors have out-grown their roles, and the strong family-values messages are disingenuous and schmaltzy. In short, the cow's been milked for all its got.But, anyway, back to the fun.In this new adventure, Juni and Carmen Cortez find themselves on a mission to stop the release of a virtual-reality video game, aptly titled, `Game Over'. It is purported to be the best video game ever, and lines outside toy stores are growing around the country. But, the ISS has learned that the infamous `level five' captures the mind of the player, entrapping him eternally within the game. The threat, of course, is that `The Toymaker', played by Sylvester Stallone, is really out to control the minds of our youth, and thus, our future.It turns out that The Toymaker himself is already entrapped in the game, so the only way to stop him is to actually play it. The movie begins when Juni, eager to be an `independent PI' at the age of 10, is called back to duty to the ISS to enter the game and find his sister Carmen, who had already tried to invade it, but was suspended in level 4. Juni catches up to her with the dubious help of a few experienced beta test players, who are determined to reach the 5th level on their own.The true essence of the film is to simply show the video game, and with the 3D glasses, the 80% of the screen time that game consumes is definitely fun and worth the ride. The funny thing is, `Spy Kids 3D' makes no attempts to hide the fact that the only reason for the film is to show game. To wit, the plot points are meaningless, even to the point where the script itself acknowledges it: Juni asks why the Toymaker is caught in the game, and the answer is a humorous hand-wave, `Oh, it just happens.' The plot and characters are hurriedly scooted along to the start of the game, which then goes on and on and on, till the end, when scores of famous cameo appearances pepper the screen, all having fun and making statements about the importance of family, and yada yada yada.Oh, it's not that there is anything wrong with such pro-family messages. But conspicuously downplayed are the genuine circumstances and feelings that were the impetus in the first, and best, of the Spy Kids trilogy.The 3D aspect of the film involves wearing glasses that give depth to the objects on the screen. There are two ways to do this, and unfortunately, Spy Kids 3D uses the old-fashioned way, from the 1950s, where one lens is red and the other blue. The film is shot with the two colors shifted in opposite directions, and depth is perceived by the distance of the shift. Unfortunately, this mutes colors so much, that the beautiful and surreal colors expressed in the digital photography are lost. I can only assume that this was intentional, so as to give the video game its own sense of other-worldliness, which again, was nice.With all its wild-riding and fun, Spy Kids 3D is just a movie for kids, unlike the first of the series, which was much smarter and hence, enjoyable by adults, too.  So, best to drop off the little tykes at the theater with a baby sitter, and go shopping for a while. But, don't buy anything that's red and blue plaid, or your kids just may throw up on you.",

            "content": "What a mess. There are clever ideas here and there, a few laughs, the occasional decent special effect (I saw this on TV so didn't see it in 3D, which perhaps would have made the generally disappointing effects more impressive), but the lame, tossed-together script and the lack of any cohesion to the final product make this only barely watchable. This movie seems to just be going through the motions; you can't even call it formulaic because it barely attempts to even stick with any formula, it's more like random stuff thrown in here and there. As for the ending, well, it's main purpose was to create an excuse (and not a very good one) to have cameos by everyone who was in the first two movies (allowing them to list Bandaras first in the credits even though he's on screen for only a couple of minutes), and the final showdown is so utterly moronic that words fail me.At the same time, I didn't actually hate it. I wasn't in pain watching it. It was a mindless Saturday afternoon movie and I watched it as mindlessly as I could and occasionally enjoyed it. But after the very fun second movie (which I thought superior to the first), this was a great disappointment. I'd advise skipping it.",

They have proved to be extremely flexible with mediocre budgets and are extremely fun to watch. And Spy Kids 3-D brings you into the experience - anything in 3-D is brilliant, but I found this an overwhelming cinematic experience with the 3-D glasses. This may explain why Spy Kids 3-D did well at the box office. Although, saying that, the only really good thing is the cinematic experience. This film does have substance enough to keep you watching through the whole thing, but there's no denying that it lacks on the intelligence and is once again, a predictable affair. And there's no character development either - didn't either of the Spy Kids learn anything from their encounters in the game? There really isn't much to warrant a DVD purchase - though you can still view it in 3D on the TV, a lot of the experience is lost in the translation. Though to be honest, this isn't exactly a gem for your collection, but it isn't exactly a large mound of doggy do either. 6/10",

            "review_title": "While Rodriguez is clearly a gifted filmmaker, he lets the 3-D hamper his creative imagination....",
            "content": "Robert Rodriguez, director of the blood-soaked action movies \"Desperado\" and \"From Dusk Till Dawn\", struck gold with his wildly inventive and creative \"Spy Kids\" in 2001. In 2002, \"Spy Kids 2\" was released, a worthy sequel, and now we arrive at \"Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over\".I've never been much a fan of 3-D, but when it is done well (like at the Disney theme parks) I am quick to applaud. Not here; Rodriguez has gone back to the Stone Age of cinema and utilizes the red-and-blue 3-D glasses from the 1950's. As you can imagine, this doesn't work too well.Still, there is much fun to be had in the third and final installment of this super-cool franchise. The kid actors perform well, although for many of them this is their first movie. Ricardo Montalban returns in a greatly-expanded role as the grandfather, and through the use of CGI, Montalban (who is restricted to a wheelchair in both the movie and in life) gets to \"walk\" again (I will not spoil how). I also liked Sylvester Stallone as the Toymaker, the bad guy who, after spending a long time in cyberspace, has literally developed multiple personalities. Stallone is clearly having the time of his life as he hams it up as the wacky and colorful villain. Elijah Wood has a quick cameo, as do most of the adult cast members from the last two movies in the film's finale.The special effects are impressive, but they are once again hampered by the 3-D (thankfully, there is a 2-D version on the DVD).In short, while the 3-D didn't work for me, I still had a good time at this otherwise excellent family movie. 7/10",

            "content": "I just came home from watching it, and everyone is running for the Advils, it seems that the 3-D gave us all headaches. Anyways, here is my review.I have had a 3-D book since I was a kid, and it came with it's own pair of 3-D glasses. You know the old fasioned kind, the red and blue shaded glasses that gives everything the red & blue tint. It is a very cool book with the old kind of 3-D.Now, I remember in the 80's, all the NEW 3-D movies had a whole new 3-D. No longer were 3-D movies limited to the red & blue tint that required the red & blue shaded glasses, the glasses that were needed were clear & POLORIZED....it kept the movie in FULL color and gave the 3-D film a cleaner and sharper image.I heard that this movie was a whole new approach to 3 demention, so I was excited about seeing this. But imagine my surprise when I bought the tickets when they handed me red & blue shaded 3-D glasses.The only new approach is the computer graphics used in creating 3-D images. Instead of throwing real items towards the camera to make you duck in your seat, now there are computer generated items floating around and flying towards you. The special effects were, as always, top quality...but honestly...there was nothing new or special about the special effects. In reality, you feel as though you've seen it all before.As for the 3-D effects. I must say how disappointed I was. The color in the film during the 3-D scenes seemed dull and almost a sepia tone, except for the red & blue tint used to make the images in 3-D.I REALLY expected at LEAST a POLORIZED image for a bolder color and clearer 3 demention. Instead, all I got was a trip down memory lane with the old fashioned 3-D.Now, if you have never SEEN a 3-D movie, dont get me wrong, it STILL is a spactacular thing to see, and you SHOULD experience it. The kids will LOVE it.As for the storyline in this film....well, forget it. This wasn't created to carry a plot, it was created to become a cash-cow in the Spy Kids series and used 3-D to draw you in. It worked, but this plot didn't.And if THIS film doesn't KILL Sylvester Stallone's movie career, then it's ALREADY DEAD! I was never more embarressed for an actor before than I was for him in this one. This was almost like seeing him wave a white flag and admit to being an aging Hollywood cast-away who is grasping at ANYTHING to stay on screen. Think Bette Davis's charactor in \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\"Oh well. Your kids will love this 3-D mess, and if your easily amused, you might also.",

Carmen (Alexa Vega) is caught in a virtual reality game designed by the Kids' new nemesis, the Toymaker (Stallone). It's up to Juni (Daryl Sabara) to save his sister, and the world.I'll admit from the off that I enjoyed the first two movies, and I love both Vega and Sabara, I find them to be a joy to watch. I know the plot calls for her not to be seen much but Alexa Vega is woefully under used. Which is a shame as she was excellent in both the previous movies. The parents Antonio Banderas and Carla Guigino are both reduced to cameos which is also a shame. This leaves Sabara to mainly carry the movie on his own, he tries hard, a little too hard as his charm from the excellent first movie, and less excellent but still highly enjoyable sequel is missing. Sly is clearly enjoying himself, playing an over the top (Yes pub intended) villain and is clearly having a lot of fun. Ricardo Montalban brings grace and dignity to everything he does. Danny Trejo and Cheech Martin aren't given as much to do this time around. Nor is Holland Taylor, which is s shame!! George Clooney, Steve Buescemi, Bill Paxton, Alan Cumming and Emily Osment all return amongst others.

            "content": "Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is a weak conclusion to the very entertaining Spy Kids franchise. Agents Juni and Carmen Cortez set out on their most mind-blowing mission yet: journeying inside the virtual reality world of a 3-D video game designed to outsmart them, as the awe-inspiring graphics and creatures of gaming come to real life. Relying on gadgetry, bravery, family bonds and lightning-quick reflexes, the Spy Kids must battle through tougher and tougher levels of the game in order to save the world from a power hungry villain. The plot sounds like it has some potential but the execution wasn't very good. I really don't have a problem with 3D but just because it is in 3D doesn't mean everything else has to be bad. The first two had good stories and were entertaining to watch. This one had a poor story and at times was too painful to watch. The acting took a drop from the previous film as most of the performances were bad. Sylvester Stallone did the worst out of everybody and I was wondering why he was even cast as his career is pretty much over. Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara play the two kids Juni and Carmen. In the first two, they give decent performances but, in this one they were awful. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino don't really appear in the film which is probably better for them. There are also a series of cameos including Salma Hayek and George Clooney. Robert Rodriguez does a rather bad job of directing as the film looks like a mess. The script is terrible and predictable. The ending is really bad as it just seemed like some cheap way to include everyone in the film. The entire film felt rushed and they should had spent more time on it. The 3D isn't even that impressive and they focused on that then more than anything else. The film is also not very enjoyable to watch. When the film isn't in 3D, it gets really boring and most of the dialog isn't very funny either. The special effects were cheesy and looked really bad. The running time was a brief 90 minutes yet that felt a lot longer with the dull story. There is just very little to like here and I think they blew it as they could had made a very successful franchise {in terms of quality not money making}. In the end, this is a poor film and its better if kids and adults alike just skip it. Rating 3/10",

And I did really like the idea of the story, it was a very original idea, sadly the execution was patchy.The storyline was sadly very predictable, and despite the impressive images on screen, it failed to have a sense of wonder. Another problem was that the script was very devoid of humour, and while the first two movies were well written and had some funny moments, this instalment had one or two laughs scattered here and there, but overall was a bit limp, and the finale was rather disappointing.The acting certainly wasn't awful, it was just a little uninspired. The two leads are fine and Ricardo Montalban is surprisingly very good as the grandfather, and while Antonio Banderas, Steve Buscemi, Tony Shalhoub and George Clonney did their best, the uneven script disallowed them to have any sense of fun. The actor I was most disappointed with, sorry guys, was Sylvester Stallone. Now I like Stallone, and I consider Oscar(1991) one of the most unfairly underrated movies ever, and I like a fair majority of his work. But here I felt he was out of character playing the villain. Hamming it up, a phrase I usually despise describes his acting here perfectly, and he overdoes it shamelessly at times.Overall, Spy Kids 3D isn't terrible, it is just mediocre, and could have been much better. 4/10 for the 3D effects, and the efforts of the cast.

You know that it  seemingly is a second-rate project with a single gimmick. You may even know about the rather offensively off-putting camp in the performances all around.But this is still worth watching for two reasons.The first is that the apparent superficiality is illusory. Casual adult viewers may think the story is Disney-like, revolving around a simple platitude - a platitude that is one of those artificial Sunday School truths we think it is good for kids but that no one actually lives. This is no Disney; in a typical Disney production - say `Lion King' - there is us and there is them. We watch them. The world is simple.Spanish (and Portuguese!) literature since `Don Quixote' has been founded on a far richer notion. There's us and the book, and within the book is another observer and an observed reality. This creates an ambiguity about who we are and whether we are in the book, or the book is in our world, or (depending on the author) whether the world is created by the `writer' in the book.It is a sophisticated notion. Very complex. When kids are exposed to it, it changes their facility for abstract reasoning, which is a whole different order of growth than `do-bee, don't-bee' moralization.  And despite apparent simplicities, this is a complex situation: the many versions of watchers and roles within roles and projections within projections are non-trivial. Forget about all the wiggling sprites and see what this is all about. Its very structure undermines its apparent saccharine morale, and makes it different than `Bullwinkle' and `Pussycats' and `Zoolander.'Just consider the `short' at the beginning: hosted by our artificial intelligence guy (Mr. Lisp - Lisp is the language of AI) who ran a TeeVee show to entrap kids. He shows a book. The characters in the book are fingerpuppets. He also comments on the upcoming movie. This is a guy who makes movies, who is in a movie, who is commenting on another movie - and does so by showing a representation (a book) of anotherrepresentation (fingerpuppets), acting out that movie.And the second reason? the 3-d of course. Now you may think this is unimportant, but we live in a visual world that is dominated by 2-d images of three dimensional reality. That means that we have generally lost our architectural awareness. Yes, it seems that this is all about those few things that come out of the screen. But it is far deeper than that, even with the primitive technology. This is from a guy who traveled a thousand miles to see a reconstructed `Dial M for Murder' played on dual projectors, possibly a once in a lifetime chance these days.It matters. If you expose your kids to kiddie films, stick to this, the Pixar projects (`Nemo` is also about space), and the original Muppet Movie. Now that's parenting instead of babysitting.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.",

The noir style opening would have gone completely over the heads of the main target audience. Sylvester Stallone was good as were the cameo appearances by George Clooney, Elijah Wood, Bill Paxton and Steve Buscemi.The computer generated sets looked tacky.

Instead of the usual 3-D films of today, which are mostly boring large screen pseudo-documentaries, or specialized environment theme park rides,: Spy Kids 3-D is a compelling franchise that the whole family can enjoy with added dimension that makes it even more exciting. Even though the film was theatrically presented in eye straining anaglyph format (red and blue), which, to date, is the most cost effective for a mass theater release and shot on a 24p 3-D High Def system (VIDEO) introduced by James Cameron, I found myself immersed enough in the story and just having fun with the genre to not really care. After all, I wasn't expecting James Bond. It's `Spy Kids' for crying out loud and they got away with it!!! Richard Rodriguez combined all elements of HD-making in a smart and acceptable way. Leave it to a cannonball gorilla HD-maker to get it done - thank god Miramax is here to let filmmakers actually create and control their own films with promise for distribution!! As a 3-D aficionado, I am hoping to see the movie in all its true-to-color and full 3-D glory one day as a polarized release or a well-mastered DVD release for virtual reality shutter glasses. To sum it all up.Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is more than an experience; it's a milestone in history that will start a new revolution in 3-D Filmmaking.

Now 2017 lets see what I think.The first one is tolerable and you can see that they are spies and for a first take movie. During that time period it was cool to see the effects and style.Second movie. It's all forgettable. As I type this I can't remember what happened. Anyways, Spy Kids 2 was garbage. It made no sense, green screen sucked, effects sucked and why are they called spies?\nWas there even a villain in this movie because the Giggle guy was also in the 3rd one without any punishment it seems. 2nd Spy Kids movie is a waste of time. The 1 thing that baffles me is that Juni gets the blame when he didn't really do anything but do the right thing.3rd spy kids movie would work if they didn't call them spy kids. Iunno why they call them spy kids when they don't do anything spyish. His sister was barely in the movie. The villains always go from evil guy to good guy without some form of punishment for what they have done. This movie was garbage, the green screen even in those days looked bad.In-conclusion only movie of the 3 worth watching is the 1st one, even tho all movies are a waste of time. Only good of the movies were the mom and dad but even after the 1st one they are portrayed as clumsy wash ups.",

            "content": "A exactly 2 months ago (April 1st and this is not a lie, you can check my reviews) I opened my movie sessions with \"TRON\" and it was a completely disappointing movie about a technician who must enter into a video game to destroy a powerful villain. First of all I have never watched anyone of those \"Spy Kids\" movie series. Lack of trust? Lack of interest? Lack of time? Who knows? All I know is that I attempt to watch \"Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over\" because I was awake, with nothing better to do and I knew that there's a big and great cast in it. Result: A boring movie and visual video game played by director Robert Rodriguez with a pathetic ending. I usually tend to simplify the story of the movie, explaining details of the plot but I won't do that. Perhaps just a little bit. It's like \"TRON\" except that this time the former spy boy Juni (Daryl Sabara, a tiny version of Jensen Ackles with almost the same angered expression) must enter into a dangerous video game created by a sarcastically villain (played by Sylvester Stallone, totally hammy) that kidnapped Juni's sister (Alexa Vega). The whole film is Juni trying to figure out a way to reach the next level and save his sister, with the help of some friends and his grandfather (Ricardo Montalban, the only good performance here). Why this movie sucked? First: I have a total dislike for movies who basically is 80% special effects with scenarios moving all the time, all those blinding colors. Annoying. I hated this one, hated \"Speed Racer\" and the only one I really liked of this new wave of movies was \"Captain Sky and The World of Tomorrow\" (needs a urgent sequence) because that was great, had a interesting plot, the visual concept was incredible and it resurrected Laurence Olivier (it's archive footage of one of his films but that's OK). Second: I don't even know if kids are that dumb to want to watch something like this. This movie wants to be too many things; want to be a comedy without funny things, want to be a spy movie but can't even kill a character and not even make a evil villain. By the way the villain played by Stallone multiplies himself into three other sad characters. If kids have enjoyed this or even adults enjoyed this film then perhaps my heart grows colder and I don't know what I'm saying. All I know is that this movie was pretty bad.Third: Here comes the list of actors who unfortunately appeared in this movie in commitment to friendship or loyalty to the director, executives and producers, and or are in it for the money: Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Steve Buscemi, Tony Shalhoub (I must have missed his scene or he's very different so I couldn't find him), Bill Paxton, Matt O'Leary, Salma Hayek, Danny Trejo, Ryan Pinkston, and of course Stallone and the child actors, and at last but not least George Clooney. In the very last scene of the movie, during the outtakes and funny movie mistakes Clooney appears saying a brief statement: This could be the end of my career (and then he burst in laughs more than that we didn't saw at 2010's Oscar). Yes, he's right about that. It could've been the end but after this film he made things far more interesting, won a Oscar, directed, wrote and acted in \"Good Night and Good Luck\" and more. In short: a movie that didn't needed to be made. Game and review over. 1/10",

I think the producer's objective was to dig into the Hollywood Actor Welfare Hat and pull out the names of several really poor actors.Defining moment: when the theater had to call an ambulance for me after I slobbered onto the floor from a seizure induced by probably some of the crappiest, blurriest special effects I have ever seen.\nOne last thing- these people that make movies for kids can't use their audience as an excuse for stupid crap like this.

Somehow the artificiality of the first two films was nicely intertwined into the third film's plot here, and I found myself enjoying it quite a lot as we enter the virtual game world of the Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone), where Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) has to find his big sister Carmen (Alexa Vega). Add a few more players into this virtual game, and this adventure takes off.The 3-D aspect did not work for me, but regardless, I enjoyed this film and particularly Stallone's several alter egos in his Toymaker role.

And the characters get uninteresting. But the biggest problem, most of the visuals. I do get that, it was the time 3-D was being developed as a new style. In fact, there are some that actually do work in others. This movie is not the case at all. Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl, the visuals look almost unfinished. Full of unnecessary closeups and the effects are a joke. This feels it's more suitable for a video game than a legitimate film. You got five worlds, a series of battles, random minions attacking other players, and the final level with the big boss. But as a movie in general, it's just a low quality mess. The only ones I can see the need of watching are those that really like the Spy Kids franchise. Other than that, I recommend to just skip this one. There's a film that came out years later after this, Ready Player One. That film has something this movie wanted to do for a direction, but is actually much more enjoyable.

            "content": "It seems like every twenty years or so, people in Hollywood find it's necessary to dig out the 3-D process to entice a new generation of film goers. In the early eighties a 3D Film called Comin' At Ya made a surprising amount of money with the process.  Shortly thereafter we were subjected to such monstrosities as Jaws 3D, Amityville 3D, and Friday the 13th 3D. Just as quickly as the process had been revived however, it once again disappeared.  Hopefully, the latest reincarnations will soon suffer the same fate.Having made a nice tidy sum with the first two Spy Kids, Robert Rodriquez must have decided he needed a gimmick to get those fannies back into the theater seats one last time and decided to give us the Spy Kids in 3d. I'll give him credit for getting the little tykes back into the theater one last time, but as a film, Spy Kids 3D is as painful an experience as any adult might ever have to experience.  Story wise, script wise, and especially cinematography wise the film is one huge convoluted mess.\nIn this third outing, Juni has resigned from the O.S.S. to strike out on his own and make it rich, or at least rich enough to be able to play a new video game called Game Over.  When word is sent to Juni(Daryl Sabara) by President George Clooney that his sister, Carmen(Alexa Vega), has been trapped inside the video game, Juni rejoins the O.S.S. to save his sister.  It seems that once the game goes on line, the evil Toymaker(Sylvester Stallone) has it rigged so that once kids complete the mysterious level five they will be trapped in the game forever and he'll be able to control them.  So shortly after he arrives at the O.S.S., Juni or at least his subconscious is whisked away into a virtual reality game world.  Time to put your scarlet and cyan glasses on folks.Now I'm not normally one to quibble with small details in a movie obviously meant for the youngest of kids, but if I'm going to suffer a headache and queasy stomach for the sake of a film, I would like for the writer and director to at least connect the dots.  It is never explained with any satisfaction as to how getting inside the game with your subconscious really works.  It can't be a big O.S.S. secret because the game is filled with a whole boatload of other kids wondering around trying to achieve the same goal.  Add to this Juni's wheelchair bound grandfather(Ricardo Montalban), whom he summons into the game to help him out.  Conveniently, Grandfather quickly spouts legs so he can play right along, and watching Ricardo Montalban inside a video game is an unnerving experience.  Watch him closely though, as he'll mysteriously disappear when not needed and reappear just in time to help Juni and Carmen out of some sticky situations.  To make matters worse, as Juni bounces around the game world, any kind of logic as to what he must do and why he must do it is thrown out the window.  Every scene is nothing but a set up for Rodriquez to throw in what he hopes his audience will see as some cool 3d magic.  It doesn't take long for it to become tiresome, to your eyes, your head, and your stomach.If all this wasn't bad enough, the villainous Toymaker and his other personalities(all played by Stallone), controls the actions of the players inside the video game, then makes decisions that actually help them win it instead of having them figuring it out on their own.  So much for any kind of suspense.  Some of this is explained toward the end of the film, but by then we are so glad to see the film come to an end, we no longer care about his rationale or lack thereof.  Despite his razzie award winning performance, I did actually like Stallone's campy over the top performance. It's too bad the script doesn't give him anything to do that makes any sense.The funny thing about Spy Kids 3D, is that Rodriquez actually had a clever idea.  It's too bad he was so intent on making use of 3D that he forgot to make a good film in the process.  It is also hard to explain why he went back to using 3D that required the glasses with different color lenses. The effect was awful twenty years ago, twenty years before that, and in 2003 is even worse.  There seems to be some great computer generated backgrounds and sets in the film, but because of the silly glasses, you never get to appreciate them because they are muted and colorless.I'm sure the kiddies will be enthralled with this film and have fun wearing the funky glasses.  If you're an adult and you must watch it with them, a quick trip to the drug store for some aspirin and Dramamine would be advised.My grade D",

            "content": "Robert Rodriguez is putting his extremely profitable kid's franchise to bed with a 3-D story that is, unfortunately not as multi-dimensional as the name would imply. Three years ago the original Spy Kids seemed like a breath of fresh air, it was a colourful, exuberant affair that burst with inventiveness and humour. The inevitable sequel, 2001's The Island of Lost Dreams, proved that there is some merit in the theory of diminishing returns, while Game Over confirms that additional incremental input will produce a declining incremental amount of output. In other words, most sequels suck. In this instalment older sister Carmen (Alex Vega) is being held hostage in an elaborate virtual reality videogame called Game Over, run by the evil Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone). Brother Juni, (Daryl Sabara) who has retired from the spy business to concentrate on his career as a private eye must rescue his sister and shut down the game. Once inside the cyberspace monolith he loses his heart to a brave young girl (played by Emily Osment, sister of the Oscar nominated Haley Joel), races giant motorbikes and gives the viewer a headache watching all the swirling action through flimsy red and green 3-D glasses. Rodriguez may have based the character of the Toymaker on himself. Like the evil genius in the movie, Rodriguez appears to be lost in his own creation, too fascinated by the 3-D technology to concentrate on giving the movie any kind of plot. What little story there is simply kick-starts the action, placing Juni in the game, and thus is an excuse to rev up the special effects. Turned loose in cyberspace the film careens through forty mind-numbing minutes of Super Mario Brothers quality graphics that flip and fly through the air, and even though things appear to literally jump off the screen, Spy Kids 3-D is flat. Spy Kids 3-D has everything the first two instalments didn't have from cardboard characters, to headache inducing special effects all the way down to bland dialogue. The film is packed with several `don't blink or you'll miss \u0091em' celebrity cameos. Rodriguez pal George Clooney provides one of the film's few legitimate laughs (Spoiler Warning!) with his subtle Sylvester Stallone impression, while Cheech Marin, Steve Buscemi, Elijah Wood, Bill Paxton and Salma Hayek check in, but aren't given much to do. Only Ricardo Montalban as the wheelchair bound grandfather seems to relish his role. Once inside the game he hams it up, trading in his chair for an animated metal superhero costume. He's entertaining to watch because he seems to be having so much fun with the silly material. He even sneaks in a joke about `fine Corinthian leather.' It's a line that the kids won't get, but anyone over the age of thirty will recognize from his years as the spokesperson for Chrysler.Montalban brings some joyfulness to the movie, and so does Stallone, it's just a different kind of joy. It's the kind of mean-spirited delight that comes from watching a formerly popular actor completely embarrass himself onscreen. Displaying an emotional depth that ranges from Rocky to Rambo, Stallone plays the evil Toymaker and three of his alter-egos, a nerdy scientist, a burn-out hippie and a war mongering general. The last time I heard such `hilarious' accents I was at my nine-year-old nephew's school play. Once Rodriguez moves the action out of the videogame the film takes on a warmer, more familiar tone, but it is too little too late. One hopes that the movie's name is prophetic, and it really is game over for the Spy Kids franchise.",

            "content": "I was a little skeptical of Spy Kids 3-D because I wasn't sure what the filmmakers were going for. Instead of the usual 3-D films of today, which are mostly boring large screen pseudo-documentaries, or specialized environment theme park rides,: Spy Kids 3-D is a compelling franchise that the whole family can enjoy with added dimension that makes it even more exciting. Even though the film was theatrically presented in eye straining anaglyph format (red and blue), which, to date, is the most cost effective for a mass theater release and shot on a 24p 3-D High Def system (VIDEO) introduced by James Cameron, I found myself immersed enough in the story and just having fun with the genre to not really care. After all, I wasn't expecting James Bond. It's `Spy Kids' for crying out loud and they got away with it!!! Robert Rodriguez combined all elements of HD-making in a smart and acceptable way. Leave it to a cannonball gorilla HD-maker to get it done - thank god Miramax is here to let filmmakers actually create and control their own films with promise for distribution!! As a 3-D aficionado, I am hoping to see the movie in all its true-to-color and full 3-D glory one day as a polarized release or a well-mastered DVD release for virtual reality shutter glasses. To sum it all up.Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is more than an experience; it's a milestone in history that will start a new revolution in 3-D Filmmaking. Kudos to Robert Rodriguez and James Cameron to a great start.",

            "content": "Great movie, with lots of adventure in it and action also, which makes the movie worth seeing and enjoyable. It almost feels like your playing some sort of video game when your watching it - especially in the Mega Race - which makes you feel like your playing Grand Pix or Need or Speed or whatever on your Play Station. But to make it more enjoyable and more exciting is to put on your 3-D glasses. Trust me, the 3-D graphics were out-of-this-world and you feel like your in the movie, as for me, I borrowed the DVD from the library and it only had one pair of 3-D glasses inside the the DVD cover (it was supposed to have four, for the whole family but I guess someone lost or stole it and me and my sister had to take turns with the 3-D glasses - not fair!) and you have to say the special effects were out-of-this-world! Just amazing - the best achievement in this movie were the special effects...just outstanding graphics.The story follows ; Juni and Cameron Cortez who have been transfer in a virtual gaming world, which was made by the Toymaker and they're trapped, now they have no choice but to the play the game with tunes of levels such as, competing in the mega race, battling through boiling lava, fighting against warriors, even stronger then they ever imagined, to save the world from the evil Toymaker. As the levels get harder and harder, Juni and Cameron need all their strengths to battle it out against the levels.Alexa Vega (Cameron Cortez) and Daryl Sabara (Juni Cortez) did some fantastic performances, you can see that they put all there energy in their performances just to make the movie more realistic and enjoyable. Antonio Banderas (Gregorio Cortez) and Sylvester Stallstone (Toymaker) did some outstanding performances too, Antonio is an incredible actor and I've seen him in other movies too, such as \"Shrek 2\" and \"Once Upon A Time In Mexico\" and you can see he put all his concentration in his role, which makes it fluent and realistic. As for, Sylvester, he shined throughout the movie with his funniness, so well done. Overall I thought all the performances by the cast were a phenomenon.The plot was well-thought out and solid from beginning to end, it did'not have too many characters or plots, which as we all know, makes the movie boring and confusing. And the writers tried so hard to keep the audience entertained with the movies twists and turns throughout and also I felt that the movie had lots of energy to act up in front of the audience and keep them captivated to watch more and more, so that was excellent as well.Overall, a spectacular movie, aimed for mostly children who loves video games and adventure, has a few twists and turns to keep the audience occupied. The special effects, performances and plot were all GREAT! So well done, the cast and crew - two thumbs up!",

During the game i liked the certain little touches, like how the Beta testers are in the game playing along side the lead. I also like the cameo's in the movie, especially Antonio Banderas and Elijah Wood's brief roles.Maybe cos i play games a lot i found this movie to be entertaining, but i still think it's worth a look from anyone who enjoys a bit of comedy, and for anyone who plays games for that matter.",

I loved the original SPY KIDS - thought it was smart, hip and fun.  I was never bored, and the actors and action was great. \nHere we have the same great actors, but no script whatsoever.  So they have nothing to do!  And the 3-D?  It's the old anaglyph technology which uses red and blue lenses!  In the 80s they developed polarization 3-D technology which IMAX has perfected.  The red and blue lenses were used in the 50s, and now exclusively for TELEVISION viewing of 3-D movies.  I suppose this will make it cheaper to go to video and dvd down the road!  But it makes the colors HORRIBLE!  So not even the 3-D is going to save this one. \nBlech!  Give me the original!",

            "review_title": "Much better on video than in the theater",
            "content": "First off, let me start by saying that I own all three Spy Kids movies and although I'm an adult male with no kids, I've seen the first one probably 5 times and the second one thrice...so I'm not a typical Spy Kids fan. However, I am a big fan of Robert Rodriguez and his maverick style of film-making, as well as his films (particularly the Desperado films, which are about as opposite from Spy Kids as you can get). Also, his DVD's are always loaded with tons of extras including commentary, behind the scenes footage, his \"10-minute Film School\" videos and other material. So his films are always worth the DVD purchase.Aside from writing and directing his films, Rodriguez is also the cinematographer, editor, production designer, visual effects supervisor and producer. Oh yeah, and HE ALSO WRITES THE MUSIC!!! Because his films are made on ultra-tight budgets yet always reap massive box office, he enjoys creative freedom unheard of to anyone in the motion picture business not named George Lucas. That's how he was able to make a 3-D film for kids.So what's the verdict? Well, when I first saw Spy Kids 3-D in the theater I was definitely underwhelmed. Perhaps I was sitting too close to the screen or maybe the picture was out of focus, but more than anything the 3-D gave me a headache and frequently I had to remove the glasses to give my eyes a rest.But a funny thing happened when I watched it again on DVD...IT WAS LIKE SEEING IT FOR THE FIRST TIME! Thanks to the sharpness of DVD (they actually recommend you watch it on a computer monitor, which is higher quality), the 3-D effect was awesome! In fact, after watching it I put in Spy Kids 2, and that movie immediately seemed weak in comparison to the dynamic 3-D effect of the third movie.Now some reviewers here have complained about the story, and they are right, it lacks the charm and wit of the other Spy Kids films. However, as Rodriguez mentions in the commentary on the disc, this is largely due to the fact that it originally was not going to be a Spy Kids film...He set out to make a 3-D film for kids that would progress like a video game, and decided later to shoehorn that plot into a Spy Kids film. And I think he succeeded...the movie advances very similarly to the way a video game advances through various levels of increasing difficulty. The visuals are cool and if you haven't seen it, the movie is worth checking out!",

            "content": "I think I would have enjoyed \"Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over\" a lot more if I had achieved a pair of 3-D glasses before seeing the film. Without them, nothing jumped out at me and the movie -- which is like one long, overdrawn theme park -- seemed rather pointless. For viewers with 3-D glasses, maybe it was a treat. But as a mainstream movie attempting to stay around for a while...well, it won't. Because it's just a long theme park ride -- and they get old after a while, especially when they're outdated.I enjoyed some scenes in \"Spy Kids 3-D.\" It is a lot like a videogame, and does a good job of mimicking one. The visual effects are never very good, probably on purpose -- graphics in videogames, after all, are not yet truly realistic. But apart from successfully making us feel as if we are in a videogame, \"Spy Kids 3-D\" does little else. In fact, it plays out like a videogame very much -- sometimes in unintended areas.Of course, director Robert Rodriguez (\"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\") is notorious for being fast-paced and furious. He is perfect for material such as this. It's just a question of whether we, as a viewer, can put up with one long 90-minute 3-D theme park ride/videogame imitation without taking part in the process. Videogames are, after all, essentially interactive -- they wouldn't be entertaining if we just watched the characters move about on the screen, which is exactly what happens here.Juni (Daryl Sabara) has retired from his family's spy agency and become a PI. Oh, yeah, forget school -- he has a steady job finding lost cats and toys. His career highlight is discovering why there's no water at a theme park for a little girl, who claims to be the owner. \"It's winter,\" he says.Juni is called back into action when his older sister, Carmen (Alexa Vega), has disappeared inside a videogame called Game Over, created by The Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone in an unthankful role), a maniacal modern-day Hitler bent on enslaving children across the world in his new never-ending videogame and thereby controlling the future fate of mankind. (Problem: how can life reproduce when all the world's children are attached to videogames? Never mind; I don't want to know.)Juni is briefed on his upcoming mission by a beautiful computer/videogame hacker, played by Salma Hayek, who is portraying a computer nerd but looks wholly different (she still has the little girl ponytails left over from \"Dogma\"). Juni is sent into The Toymaker's new game in an attempt to shut down the system core before it goes live in a matter of hours, and every single child across the world plugs into the contraption (save those who can't afford or don't want to own such a thing, another obvious problem overlooked by the film).Inside he is befriended by a group of fellow Beta Testers (individuals who get to try out the game prior to release,) who call Juni The Guy, since he looks like the outline of the advertising figure printed on the videogame's cover art, who is destined to be the leader of the Beta Testers and who will unlock the secret of the \"unwinnable\" Level 5. This must be an ill-fated spoof on Keanu Reeves' The One, but the laughs never go anywhere. In fact, when the real \"Guy\" is finally revealed, it's none other than Elijah Wood, who survives two minutes before being booted out of the game. I appreciate the cameo, but wouldn't it have been a lot funnier to cast Keanu Reeves in the brief role? The thin parody of \"The Matrix\" would have been even clearer. In fact, I was half expecting Elijah to crouch down and call the group of children The Fellowship of the Game at one point.Antonio Banderas is given top billing in \"Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over,\" although fans of the actor will be disappointed to realize he shows up at the end of the movie to try and destroy The Toymaker's virtual self after he breaks out into the real world. (Question: how do computer programs take life form when the universe is not run by a computer processor? Hmm..) In fact, the real star of the show is Daryl, and that's unfortunate since the chubby little twerp has -- what film critics call -- absolutely no sense of screen presence whatsoever. The little guy can't act too well, either, especially when he's interacting with his fellow videogame testers and demonstrating his best materialization of the expression \"Bug-Eyed.\"I'm being unfair. The movie has some good parts to it. Some. If you shut off your brain and do not try to follow the plot at all (which I realized halfway through is impossible since the longer the film runs the lesser the cohesion and common sense grow), you may find yourself enjoying the ride. I might have if I had been given 3-D glasses beforehand. But if you go into this film without some, the fact that it's just one long theme park ride marketed as a feature film becomes quite apparent.I liked the cameos and, to a certain extent, Robert Rodriguez' bright and vibrant visualization of the inside of a videogame matrix (though it has been done before -- remember \"The Lawnmower Man\"?) Rodriguez can make good action movies. \"Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over\" is primarily a failure because it is nothing than one long overdrawn ride without a point. It's a good family film with morals, but it mimics what it is spoofing too much. It's nothing than a long videogame, only when you're not in control of what's happening, videogames are pretty dull. Why do you think no one likes to let their friends have a go on their game consoles?For Rodriguez, this series has just lost its third life. Game over.\n2.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",

            "review_title": "Vision vs. Presentation (How to Enjoy a 3D Movie)",
            "content": "This movie continues the family-oriented Spy Kids series, which are exemplified by Robert Rodriguez's exuberant visual style, along with heavy doses of tongue-in-cheek humor and a consistent grounding in positive values, especially mutual support within one's family.  \"Spy Kids 3\" is a fine addition to this highly entertaining series.Why is the IMDB rating so depressed then?  A lot of people (18%) gave it the lowest rating of \"1\".  I guess that some people react very negatively toward the stereoscopic presentation, which employs blue/red color filtration (anaglyphic system) to deliver to each eye its particular view of things. This mode of presentation makes sense for general distribution in a wide variety of theatres where the technical requirements of polarized 3D could not be reliably delivered.  Also, the packed theatres during the first couple of weeks of release pretty much guaranteed bad viewing aspects for a good portion of the audience.  And then, others have unreal expectations of the 3D presentation.Here's my advice for enjoying this movie:(1) Don't sit so close!  Sit in the back half of the theatre and toward the center if possible.  Some people incorrectly assume that sitting closer will enhance the 3D effect.  Instead, they force their eye muscles to try to do nearly impossible tricks.  Typical result of such strain might be a headache.(2) Don't expect the same result you may have seen in special theatres such as Omni or Imax where the polarized system allows true color registration and audience distance from the screen is more controlled.  The anaglyphic system does cause loss of photorealism and present odd conflicts between the eyes.  Try to accept this limitation as the price of the 3D effect. (Hopefully before too long, we will also see a version of this film released in polarized format at theatres which specialize in such presentations.)(3) Accept strangeness.  A 3D movie is not like real vision. We see the real world in 3D, but we use focus to filter out details that are not what we are directly looking at.  In a movie everything is typically in focus at the same time. Also, in such a movie as this, which relies on composited elements, there will be some mistakes in the combining of the images.  For example, at one point, we are on the moon, and the distant Earth hovers in front of the horizon!  At other times, characters appear to stand above or below the surfaces they should be walking on.  Though only occasional, these errors do distract, and I hope that future releases of this movie might adjust the composition to correct these errors.Some people complain that the 3D effects are not extreme enough, but they overestimate the possibilities on the medium.  This movie is exemplary in its well-constructed execution of stereoscopic 3D.My overall verdict: a worthy conclusion to the Spy Kids series.  Great visual style and panache, funny references to the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings, positive values without preachiness.  Extra point for the best theatrical 3D since \"Dial M for Murder\".

Robert Rodregez (the director and writer of the spy kids) made 3 movies about the character machete. number one Machete, this movie is about machete's agency turning on him and machete tracking down and killing everyone in the agency. the movie is full of language.

            "review_title": "\"Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over\"- A frustratingly mediocre follow-up to the legitimately amusing franchise.",
            "content": "Robert Rodriguez is honestly one of the most frustrating figures in Hollywood that one could follow and be a fan of. From his humble beginnings as a low-budget action director on films like \"El Mariachi\", to the slick and stylish effects-extravaganzas like \"Sin City\", Rodriguez has proved time and again that he's a grand storyteller and a valuable member of the filmmaking community. Yet, for every major breakthrough he's played a part in, and for all of his remarkable high- quality releases that wow both critics and audiences alike... there's at least one if not not more significant and wince-inducing missteps that make you question your fandom. For every \"Desperado\", there's a \"Machete Kills\"... For every \"From Dusk Till Dawn\", there's an \"Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl.\" And for every \"Spy Kids\", there's unfortunately a film like \"Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over.\" While I was never quite the target audience for Rodriguez's manic and wild kids-film series, I still could definitely not deny its imagination and creativity. The first two chapters, flawed though they may be, are fine and entertaining features that to this day still thrill and wow children the world over. The same could not be said of the third chapter. Released in the early 2000's when Rodriguez was experimenting with the new digital technology that would become a hallmark of his more recent work, \"Game Over\" is a frustratingly mediocre follow-up to two otherwise good films, and I think it's pretty clear what the problem is- Rodriguez doesn't really seem to treat this round of \"Spy Kids\" as anything more than a sophisticated tech-demo. It's not really a movie so much as it's an 80-minute experiment that our writer/director is using to test the bounds of green-screen filmmaking and low-cost visual effects. It's cold, methodical, clinical and frankly boring.Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) has retired from the OSS and now lives a quiet life as a child private investigator. However, when he learns that his sister Carmen (Alexa Vega) has been captured and is evidently imprisoned in the Beta of an upcoming virtual-reality video-game called \"Game Over\", he is forced back into action! He must infiltrate this new game- created by a dastardly villain called \"The Toymaker\" (Sylvester Stallone), to save his sister and perhaps the world once again! Along the way, he will encounter new friends and allies, and also call on the help of returning characters to stop The Toymaker's evil plans...Honestly, it's really hard to discuss the merits of the film because there's so little happening. Yeah, there's the shell of a plot and one or two minor beats of character establishment and development, but its only there to justify the constant and consistent sequences of green-screen \"action.\" It's obvious that Rodriguez is simply using the film as a platform to play around with his new digital \"toys\", and the movie suffers for it. The actors appear lost in most of the scenes (presumably because they are, as they awkwardly walk around in front of a blank screen), and what little story there is comes off more like an afterthought than a focus. What makes it all the more confusing is that just a few years later, Rodriguez co-directed the excellent \"Sin City\", which similarly used a near-exclusive \"green screen studio\" approach, but it worked. Maybe his experience and mistakes with this film helped him to learn what to do and what not?Really, the only thing I can address is the quality of the effects and the nature of the action, and that is what just barely salvages the film. While the digital animation is pretty low-quality, it works as it was attempting to emulate video-games, so it gave it a sort-of appropriately-dated quality that I enjoyed. The action can be dull quite often, but a few sequences do adequate jobs at wowing the audience, so there's some fun to be had with the video-game concept. I also felt the early use of \"modern 3-D\" was charming, and while it mainly consists of throwing something in the audience's face every few minutes, it worked well enough. I might not be a fan of the old-fashioned Red/Cyan glasses approach, but the 3-D gave it a sense of kitschy fun. I also did enjoy the rampant cameos of characters from the previous films, and I think they'll likely delight young children.As it stands, \"Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over\" is a disappointing and forgettable sequel in the franchise, and won't likely win any new fans. Its just a series of loosely-connected CGI action set-pieces with a paper-thin plot to tie them together. But I think there's just enough dumb fun to be had with just enough key sequences that massive fans of the first two might wanna consider giving it a shot at least once. Everyone else need not apply, though.It gets a below-average 4 out of 10 from me.",

            "content": "SPOILERSIt seems strange that in a world so full of advancing technology that film creators return to such old styles. 3D Graphics are by no means a new concept, and so to use them after such a long time feels strange. I must confess here and now that I rented it on video rather than dvd. For some reason the video version didn't have any 3D quality to it and in a way I wonder whether this might have detracted from my enjoyment. When I say this, I mean it might have removed the one thing good about this film.In \"Spy Kids 3-D\", Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) has left the spy world in disgust and is working as a private investigator. Upon learning of his sisters disappearance, he returns and enters a computer game in an attempt to find and save her.What can I say is good about this film? Well not too much I'm afraid. The plot and script are awful, which is a shame after the original two films were actually really entertaining. The film delivers cheesy line after cheesy line and seems to believe it can hide this simply by adding impressive special effects. The rudamentary family links are absent, as is Rudi's sister Carmen (Alexa Vega) for the majority of the film (only for her to turn up and grate on everybody's nerves). The list of cameo's as the end are good if for the fact that Steve Buschemi makes a reappearance, but ultimately they do feel like a marketting ploy. In fact, practically everything about this film is awful. I watched it with one of my housemates and we sat grimacing at certain parts which are so extreme it is ridiculous. The excessive moral points made throughout (but especially at the end) are predictable and irritating, and seem to be making up for a relatively small ammount in the first two films. To be honest, I think when my housemate said \"that's the worst film I've ever seen\", he probably wasn't far off. It might not be as bad as \"Crocodile Hunter\", which remains the only film I've ever been tempted to actually walk out of, but it was terrible. Truth be told, and the only reason I'm mentioning this is because I'll regret it if I don't, the only plus side with this film is how much it seems to ridicule the computer game industry. Certain characters in the game appear to be \"cool\" only to be revealed in real life as \"geeks\" and \"nerds\" with no lives, the different elements of the game owe slight digs at games involving lava, pod racing games (in reference to the scene in \"Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace\"), and snowboard games. Sadly though, much as I like the idea of a film ridiculing computer game obsessives, not even that element of this film saves it from being an absolutely waste of time and money. I won't pretend to know whether a child would like this film or not, but after the first two, I doubt even they will feel particularly satisfied. Avoid this film and just watch the first two films instead.",

            "content": "The third installment of Robert Rodriguez' franchise is actually funnier and more inventive than last year's ISLAND OF LOST DREAMS, and conveys wonderful messages about family bonding and loving your neighbor. Young Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) has turned his back on the spy biz, becoming a pint-size gumshoe (in a funny takeoff of the old Hollywood film noir stereotype), but when the President (George Clooney, obviously having more fun than he did in SOLARIS) informs him sister Carmen (Alexa Vega, ripening into quite a babe) has disappeared while playing in a virtual reality game created by the evil Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone, in his first successful film in YEARS), Juni (and the audience) dons 3-D glasses and dives into a three-dimensional adventure! The film maintains a breakneck pace, and optical effects abound as Juni struggles through one level after another, receiving bogus advice from the Giggles (Salma Hayek and Mike Judge). He's offered a chance to receive assistance from one family member, and he chooses Grandpa (Ricardo Montalban, who, thanks to CGI, can walk, and gives a heck of a performance for an 83-year old!) Grandpa and Toymaker were adversaries 30 years ago (Toymaker costed the elder Cortez his legs, as he was imprisoned in another dimension), and they have a hidden agenda of their own to settle, which creates the 'Real World' finale of the film: a battle royale, pitting a squad of giant robots against the entire Contez family, AND the other heroes and villains of the previous two films (bringing back Alan Cummings, Tony Shalhoub, Steve Buscemi, Cheech Marin, and Bill Paxton, among others). Good triumphs (did you REALLY expect otherwise?), Stallone learns a lesson in forgiveness, and everybody bonds (as we are taught the lesson, EVERYBODY is family). The film has many charms, from Clooney's dead-on impersonation of Stallone, to Antonio Banderas' cameo, dropping EVERYTHING to help his children. I only wish Carla Gugino, as Mom Cortez, could have been seen more; she looks FABULOUS! Take the kids and grandkids...this one is a winner!",

Only once before have I hated a film so much that I felt cheated out of the money I spent to see it.  The first two SK films were clever child fodder that was entertaining enough to sustain an adult's attention.  However, this sorry excuse for a film was neither clever nor entertaining.  And it featured the WORST 3-D I've ever seen (even worse than \"Freddy's Dead\" -- I was unaware that was possible).  The paper thin premise has Daryl Sabara entering the video-game realm to find his trapped sister, Alexa Vega, and shut down the videogame, run by Sly Stallone. It's sad when Stallone was truly the best thing about the film (never thought I'd hear myself say that!).  The writing (if you could call it that) was droll and uninspired, the visuals were computerish and bland, and the story was non-existant.The film features 70 mins of headache-inducing 3-D that would make Alfred Hitchcock (Dial M for Murder) and Vincent Price (House of Wax) roll over in their graves. When I was a kid (which was not that terribly long ago, I'm 26), red-and-blue 3-D films were run on 2 projectors simultaneously.  In addition to adding depth to the film, it really did make things appear to pop out of the screen.  This film, however, was run on one projector, and while it did have depth, nothing popped out and the 3-D ruined the lush colors that it was filmed in.  With newer technology in 3-D projection, it REALLY bothers me that they didn't go with the gray-tinted glasses used in recent years -- geez, the 3-D episode of \"3rd Rock From the Sun\" looked like a Salvador Dali next to this 1-year-old-child's-painting.  I wasn't expecting a \"Captain-EO\" Disneyworld attraction but I did expect much better from what had been a classy set of kid's films.My final gripe is that Sabara received fourth billing when was the star of the film.  It wasn't until 9/10 of the way through that Vega shows up, and all of the \"stars\" from the previous films are reduced to an embarrassing cameo at the end.  The only stars who have major parts (which are still minor at that) are Stallone, Montalbon, Hayek and Judge.The only good thing I have to say is that it was interesting to see the screen-tests for Sabara and Vega that run after the credits are through (though I was the only one in the theatre who waited around long enough to see them).  Avoid this turkey til it comes out on video, where it'll probably play better in 2-D!",

The one consistent thing about the series is the awful quality of the special effects, where you see CGI at its very worse. This time around, most of the story is set in a video game virtual reality world, so at least the graphics have an excuse to be bad. Sylvester Stallone, who you feel sorry for, plays the new villain who the kids have to fight against, but it's all interminable action scenes and unfunny humour.

            "content": "Being a big fan of the first two Spy Kids movies, I was a little worried to see what would happen when they shifted the focus from story and character to effects and spectacle.  Sure, the first two movies relied heavily on special effects and CGI, but Spy Kids 3-D REALLY takes the cake for 3D (in both senses of the term) effects.  Much to my surprise, I was still absorbed in the story and the new characters, and found myself genuinely concerned and curious as to the outcome.  I really love the consistency of characters (mostly evident in the Cortez family) and their relationships.  The audience feels like they really know them.Sylvester Stallone (times three) and Salma Hayek add a new interesting dynamic, as do the four new kids in the video game (The strength, the brains, the cool and the intuition... heh).  Definitely cool was the return of nearly every central and secondary character from the first two films (Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez, her parents, Floop and Minion, Romero, Gary and Gerti Giggles, Uncle Machete, \"Uncle\" Felix, Dinky Winks, etc.).  I would have loved a serious establishing shot of this whole cast of characters in the climax of the film.The 3D was fun, not really that distracting, and while this is probably the weakest of the three films storywise, it's obvious why--it's not as much about the story, it's about the spectacle.  Take it for what it is and you'll enjoy it immensely.  Furthering the uplifting pro-family message, Spy Kids 3-D is a charming, fresh, entertaining film.Not my favorite SK film, but definitely an interesting twist and turn to the series.  It'll be interesting to see just how far these films (and kids) will go.  Rodriguez really has done something incredible in the creation of these films (writing, directing, composing music, editing, all out of his own studio, I understand...) and should be supported for the message he's putting out there, considering the usual crap that Hollywood dishes out and calls morals.9/10.",

Basically Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) is alone at home, and realises that his sister Carmen (Alexa Vega) has been kidnapped by the new villain, the Toymaker (a ridiculous Sylvester Stallone, although I hadn't seen him for a little while, he deservedly won a Razzie). She is trapped inside a real video game that he has created, and with the help of some technicians, Juni has to go in and get his sister out by passing the many levels, and be careful not to lose too many lives. He does this with the help of his crippled Grandfather (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan's Ricardo Montalban), well, he's not crippled in the game world of course, and some other kids trying to get out with him. He manages to rescue Carmen and the other kids, but there is a brief moment where unseen (apart from special glasses) monsters are attacking, and with the help of other characters from the two previous films have to defeat them, and then the Toymaker. Also starring Antonio Banderas as Gregorio Cortez, Carla Gugino as Ingrid Cortez, King of the Hill and Beavis and Butt-Head creator Mike Judge as Donnagon Giggles, Salma Hayek as Cesca Giggles, Richard 'Cheech' Marin as Felix Gumm, Danny Trejo as Machete, Alan Cumming as Fegan Floop, Men in Black's Tony Shalhoub as Alexander Minion, Steve Buscemi as Romero, Bill Paxton as Dinky Winks, George Clooney as Devlin and Elijah Wood as The Guy. You can tell even without 3D glasses which moments \"stick out\" (LOL), but this is not an impressive film. Stallone is too kooky as four personalities, there is no real story, the chat is too corny, and only kids will enjoy it, it is just stupid. Pretty poor!",

In order to save his sister, Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) must enter the game and work his way to the unbeatable fifth level.Before watching Spy Kids 3-D Game Over, be sure to carefully adjust your TV, as per the instructions on the DVD; only that way can you truly appreciate what a lousy 3D system Robert Rodriguez has employed for this third part in his Spy Kids saga. The colours are terrible, the picture is blurry, and the effect is so flat that you may find yourself stopping the film to check that you haven't accidentally popped in the 2D version by mistake.It's a shame the gimmick is so crap, because if the extra dimension had worked better, I might have been a bit more forgiving about the terribly weak plot and the total waste of an impressive cast: Rodriguez's lame script consists primarily of a series of silly FX laden set pieces, the best of which borrows heavily from The Phantom Menace's pod race, and also shoe-horns in some gag-worthy sentimentality; and for much of the running time, the film rests heavily on the shoulders of Daryl Sabara, who simply hasn't got the acting chops for such a task. Poor Sabara desperately needs support from his on-screen family (Vega, Antonio Banderas, Carla Gugino, Danny Trejo), but they don't turn up till the film is almost over, and the film's biggest names (Stallone aside) are merely confined to amusing cameos: Salma Hayek as Mrs. Giggles; George Clooney as the President; and Elijah Wood as 'The Guy', the game's Neo-style pseudo-saviour.With each successive sequel proving to be much worse than its predecessor, I can't say that I hold out much hope for the upcoming Spy Kids 4: Armageddon (although, admittedly, it will be nice to see Alexa Vega again, now that she's all growed up!).",

The mass cameos at the end cannot save it and I think even the director knew that the franchise had come to a sticky halt.It is a prime example of a film series where the third part lets it down due to a lack of fresh ideas and the fact that there are so many characters to try and bring back.Stallone is the best thing about this film and if you see it then you'll know how tongue in cheek that remark was.",

And the game, if activated, will control all the minds of the children playing them.I didn't like the movie at first.  The plot was vague, the jokes silly and when Juni enters the game no rules are given.  Very annoying...and I never liked video games anyways.  But eventually the story clears up, the special effects are impressive and (best of all) the whole trip inside the game (95% of the movie) is in 3-D!  I've always loved wearing those glasses and having things thrown at you.  The effects didn't always work (sometimes I saw double images instead of 3-D) but when it did work it was great!  And I didn't have one of those 3-D headaches afterwards!The acting was just OK--this movie was basically made to show off the special effects.  And top-billed Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino have maybe 10 minutes screen time combined--although Banderas is clearly having a FUN time!  Montalban is just great as the kids grandfather but Stallone is disappointing as the main villain.  He tries but he was never good at doing comedy.  So I'm giving it a 6 mostly for the special effects and the 3-D.  Forget what little there is of a story.  Also stay seated for some funny outtakes right after the 3-D closing credits.",

Central plot regards a toy maker who invites kids to literally become part of a video game where they remain trapped if they lose. Juni Cortez sets to rescue his sister and is aided by his wheelchair bound grandfather. Lame plot with only its 3D images to gain any interest. Directed by Robert Rodriguez who isn't nearly as successful here as he was with the first film. Daryl Sabara plays Juni who accepts the task at hand and prevails through disaster until arriving at a corny climax. Alexa Vega as his sister gets to be a prisoner in the game until Sabara bails her ass out. Ricardo Montalban as the grandfather is the best performance going from disabled to becoming the puzzle piece that matters as well as do the one thing that the villain wasn't prepared for. Sylvester Stallone as the toy maker is involved in a lot of corny scenes but it appears that Stallone is laughing at himself, which makes his performance somewhat tolerable. Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino return as the parents but they are merely making cameos at this point. Despite its message regarding video game addiction the film seems purposed as a money making gimmick. Score: 5 / 10",

The video game story was okay, but I like video games, and Stallone played a good cameo. Go see it in the theater, 3-D is much better there than on the TV, I remember when I was a kid 7-11 sold the glasses for some cheesy 3-D ape movie and yuck.

This pretty straight forward video arcade/virtual reality version of 3-D had its moments, but nothing that a traditional movie like Tron could have handled with more excitment. As for a 3-D entertainment, this version is one of the better ones compared to what's out there - this one had a plot and the soft landing ending was nice for a change.June 1, 2022. More than 18 years after my first movie review of this movie, I happened to see it on Pluto Fantastic streaming service again while compiling my day's comments on my 2022 political campaign activities. Maybe having my mind occupied with two things at the same time, allowed me to overlook most of this movie's deficiencies and without the drawbacks with sunblock stinging, watery eyes this time and without old 3-D technology and smudgy glasses. Somehow viewing this movie as a parody made the whole movie more entertaining and enjoyable. Of course the animation is terrible, and the dialogue is well pretty one-dimensional and yet the movie itself was mindless fun as well as having a nice climax with a surprising all-star cast of cameos. It just felt like a lot of friendly fun with a great message at the end. Even Sylvester Stallone whose five roles received the worst acting award (Razzies) is unfair when considering what the screenwriter and the director was trying to accomplish in this movie for young people. This movie is worth watching for its uplifting attitude instead of getting lost in the movie's technical under-achievements. Viewing this movie as a parody instead of a serious animated film works wonders. Just enjoy it instead of trying to find fault and comparing with other movies.",

            "content": "Game Over. Game Over is the sub-heading to this third Spy Kids film, and boy does \"Game Over\" just about sum it up. This second sequel, in what has been, in all honesty, a laborious and solemn franchise of child-induced shenanigans and daft spectacle more often than not the wrong side of painful, is near-to unwatchable; a tumbling, spindly, visually ugly little piece rotten to sit through and annoying to think about. American director Robert Rodriguez has always been the king of a kind of crass; a filmmaker often making gleefully scuzzy B-movies, from his own scripts, which riff on either science fiction or crime - more often than not pulling them off. The Spy Kids films have always been where Rodriguez strikes out; his foundations built on guerrilla filmmaking, in El Mariarchi, gave way in equal tandem to both Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Assualt on Precinct 13 pastiches, in 1998's The Faculty as well as 1996's From Dusk till Dawn, respectively, which further still led much more recently onto postmodern homages of the Grindouse movement and classical Hollywood noir. Spy Kids, and its sequels, just seem to be the lame and unnecessary blot on your man's CV; a playground, a test area for the director to experiment with green screen backgrounds and to kick back with people of whom he has previously worked.The little kid from the previous two films, who was never that interesting, here drives this entry; he is Juni Cortez, played by Daryl Sabara, and the film's first mistake is to promote him from the good foil that he was to his sister, played by Alexa Vega, to chief protagonist. After a lot of old nonsense at the death of Spy Kids 2, which encompassed his dismissal from the secret agent society within which his entire family operated, Juni is working as a \"gumshoe\" for private child clients whilst doing his best to solve other such conundrums like removing people's cats from trees. He walks down lonesome streets and arranges to meet in old theme parks devoid of activity; he is as empty and as desolate as these places look. A film along these lines revolving around Juni as a P.I. might have been good fun; Rodriguez would go on to explore such things in an as additionally-a post-modern way, and with the sorts of green screen effects put to use here, in his following project, Sin City.Unfortunately, we get all of about five minutes of the \"Juni the P.I.\" movie; the film spiralling down an unrestrained and positively puerile path more broadly representative of Sabara's character propelling himself into a video game to encounter temperamental youths and duel with them. The catalyst for all this nonsense is the mysterious kidnapping of his sister, Carmen, and her consequent disappearance into this virtual-reality; a situation painfully set up by Salma Hayek's exposition \u2013 a role you can literally see Hayek having second thoughts about as the film wears on and her role gets gradually more plentiful. This video game alternate reality Juni must enter is apart of a broader network of video gaming franchising that has the world's child population hooked. However, there is something sordid and underhanded beneath its surface; a wicked individual at its heart running the thing named The Toymaker, who is an old enemy of Juni's ex-employers and is played here by Sylvestor Stallone - Often, one incarnation of Stallone is enough in a film; here, and because we begrudgingly get four of him.Prior to going in, Juni is additionally swept up in the wave of popularity this video game has on everyone \u2013 but would someone of Juni's life experiences thus far really be into such a juvenile thing? Rodriguez painstakingly inserts this central tract about how the one thing you think is all conquering and glamorous is actually somewhat flawed; additionally, there is a persistent coming back to how important it is not to cheat at games you play with people. The politics are in the right place, but anyone either elder than nine years old or looking for something a little more out of the film, is not. What the mission consists of, is a bunch of one-on-one duels with other gamers: there is a sword fight; an automobile race; a boxing match involving gigantic robots \u2013 none of it interesting, most of it capable of unfolding in any order you like and anybody who has seen 1982's TRON and doesn't think of it while they watch it just isn't trying hard enough. The film's end credits are particularly revealing, in that the project's lone laugh is a natural instance which rears up during shooting; the technical aspects behind the project, as Rodriguez et al. use the green screen and the machinery to recreate the virtual-reality world, look quite interesting \u2013 proving that the theory and technicalities behind such technology is inherently more interesting than anything people create with it. As the film dies its death during its Time Bandits-inspired finale, one character stops amidst the chaos as asks: \"Wait a minute, who won?\" Well, we in the audience certainly didn't.",

So Juni has to go inside of the game to rescue his sister while shutting down the game, run by the wicked Toymaker (Sly Stallone).Spy Kids 3 would've worked as a 10-minute ride at Disney World. 3-D rides are always fun. However, when you're in an uncomfortable seat for 90 minutes with uncomfortable glasses over your real glasses looking at flashing colors, that's not good. It's basically a special effects piece. The characters were basically Photoshopped onto FX bodies and moved around. It's faker than Joan Rivers. The video game world looked wonderful, like a giant computer game (really\u0085), but the plot was so convoluted that it was impossible to believe. The 3-D aspect of it didn't really work, either. The whole purpose of the 3-D glasses and the extra time to make it into the third dimension is to have things shoot out at you. The main thing that the glasses did was to have everything look a little out of the screen, but barely recognizable. When something did fly at you, it was usually metal bolts, which became boring after awhile.George Clooney was one of the best actors of 2002 in Solaris. Antonio Banderas is a good action star. Mike Judge is a genius at comedy. Salma Hayek's really hot. Alan Cumming was in X2. Tony Shalhoub is great in TV's Monk. Steve Buscemi is one of the greatest underated actors out there. Bill Paxton is a good all-around actor. Elijah Wood makes tons of money from Lord of the Rings. What do they all have in common? They sold out to a big-budget Disney movie that's a second sequel from the original two years ago! Why oh why would they do that? They don't need the extra publicity. It wasn't as if they needed their name out there, nor an extra paycheck. It wasn't a funny cameo like in Austin Powers in Goldmember. It was a stupid cameo.As I was watching Spy Kids 3-D, a scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail kept on popping into my head. A town square has eager men waiting to burn a witch. However, the hangman doesn't believe she is a witch, so he's trying to persuade the townspeople that she isn't a witch. Witches float, so he asks, `What else floats in water?' King Arthur says, `Wood.' And that's the perfect adjective to describe its acting. After the success of Haley Joel Osment (whose sister appears in Spy Kids 3-D) in The Sixth Sense, everyone thinks that all kids are terrific actors, when, in fact, better acting is seen at a rehearsal for a grade school play. At times, cuteness can sell a movie, but face it, these spy kids are no longer kids! They're pre-teens and losing their appeal. This means one thing for sure: no Spy Kids 4Robert Rodriguez is a one-man show. He can direct! He can produce! He can film! He can edit! He can compose! He can't make a good 3-D movie, though!My rating: 4/10Rated PG for action sequences and peril.",

The premise of the movie is one that Alexa Vega (Carmen Cortez) is caught in a virtual reality game and Daryl Sabara (Juni Cortez) her brother must get her out.  The spy kids go into this video game to fight the Toymaker played by Sylvester Stallone.  If you remember the movie `Tron', you will see about the same thing in this one.  The characters in the game have a certain number of lives, and they must fight to get to the fifth level to win.  The movie was made in the cheap 3-D version and you must wear those bad red and blue glasses.  By the end of the movie, you will have a headache for something you did not need to see.  However, the younger kids loved the movie.  So you may have to take your kid to see the movie even though you will end up with a headache.  1/10",

But he gets thrown back into the spy world, when his sister Carmen Cortez is kidnapped by the Toymaker. Carmen is trapped inside the Toymaker's video game, and the only way Juni can reach her is by going into the third dimensional world himself.After two successful films, the final Spy Kids movie goes 3D. Although it has a slight red and green tint on the screen, the actual effects used for it are quiet impressive and really provides the most fun for the film. Out of watching it in 3D or 2D, the preferred choice would be to watch it in 3D, as certain effects are too obvious in 2D. The process of going 3D is successful, but unfortunately, the film really fails on the story. The film is more of a chance to have 3D effects. It starts off OK, with a slight story appearing, but once you get to the last 30 minutes, it drops drastically. Instead of producing a fantastic ending, it just provides a chance to deliver cameos from nearly all the lead stars of the first two films. Even though it's a joy to see all these stars appearing, it is a really unnecessary move and does not give the proper ending it should have had. Fans of the film would love the final instalment of the trilogy.\"Glasses, Quick!\" \u0096 Gregorio Cortez (Antonio Banderas)",

The catch is that she is trapped inside the Toymaker's video game and therefore Juni must transport into the video game and beat its 5 notoriously difficult levels to get to her and beat the game! I think what makes it my favourite is, on a personal level, it was the one I watched most as a kid and have more memories of. Also, the video game aesthetic was such a great idea for the Spy Kids franchise; it still holds up today and it's such a fun film to watch! It's definately Stallone's delightfully strangest performance yet; more testament to the fact that he is a really good actor and not just an action star! Everyone from the series makes a cameo at some point or another and makes for the warmest and coolest sequence in the film. There's even a brilliant cameo from Elijah Wood reuniting with the director from the Faculty days. Daryl Sabara gets to really shine here having the majority of screen time and is a central character we can really root for! I think Rodriguez really mastered playing on the spy-noir genre with pint-sized super agents which is showcased superbly in the opening which has ultra smooth music accompanying Sabara's awesome narration. The 3D technique is used to its full potential here as that was this episodes main marketing focus and it works really well in terms of their 3D gags translating even in 2D. Visually there are sequences such as the motor racing and lava surfing that are really exciting and the whole narrative is a loving tribute to video games from an innovative filmmaker",

            "content": "If Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is, in fact, the end of the Spy Kids movies, it's just about the most anti-climactic end to a series ever. Where the first two films were fun and enjoyable, Spy Kids 3-D is overbearing and obnoxious. The film makes the fatal mistake of utilizing 3-D technology that just doesn't work (it's those old red- and-blue glasses that should've been made obsolete in the '50s), and effectively infuriates those in the audience over the age of twelve.In a prologue that's mercifully not in 3-D, we learn that Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) has abandoned the Spy Kid lifestyle in favor of detective work (he couldn't handle the pressure that comes with being a spy, apparently). But when his sister Carmen (Alexa Vega) is kidnapped and held hostage inside a cheesy video game developed by the Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone), Juni has to pick up where he left off and venture inside the game to save her.That simplistic storyline is a big part of why Spy Kids 3-D fails as horribly as it does. The teamwork aspect of the first two films, between Carmen and Juni, is almost completely absent here. And that was a big part of what made those films as entertaining as they were: the idea that this squabbling pair of siblings had to work together to solve a variety of complex and clever puzzles. Here, the majority of the film is akin to watching someone else play a video game, as Juni gets into car chases, fights robots, etc. With hardly a whiff of a plot to keep things moving, this becomes incredibly tedious almost immediately. While the special effects are admittedly quite impressive, they'd be more at home in an arcade.Surprisingly, Daryl Sabara (who's been one of the weaker actors of the series) really steps up and does a fairly decent job at carrying the film. And, Sylvester Stallone is especially good, playing multiple characters, and pulling off the comedy remarkably well. And the good thing was Salma Hayek, who appears with a white lab coat and her hair in two pigtails, \u00e0 la Emma \"Baby Spice\" Bunton.And then, of course, there's the 3-D aspect of the movie. Every single moment of the film that takes place inside the game (which adds up to at least an hour of screen time), is presented using \"the very latest digital technology\" (or so says the press notes) of 3-D effects. But really, this is about as effective as those old William Castle movies of the '50s - and just as annoying. Seeing through these flimsy glasses proves to be the first major test, as the blue portion of the glasses seems to have been tinted a little too darkly. Even if you're able to see properly, you'll immediately notice that supposed 3-D objects barely appear to leave the screen. And it's not like the technology to create effective 3-D images doesn't exist; James Cameron's Ghosts of the Abyss did a superb job of immersing the audience in a realistic-seeming 3-D world. Fortunately, Rodriguez seems to have predicted that most people wouldn't be able to sit through an entire movie wearing the glasses, and the movie is watchable without them. Background images have primarily been \"enhanced,\" meaning it's actually preferable to view the flick without the aid of the glasses.Spy Kids 3-D will presumably fare a lot better on home video, where the 3-D effects will be removed from the film. But even if that's the case, you'll still have to sit through a terminally dull storyline that makes Tron look like Citizen Kane.",

Unfortunately this film does not hold up at all.The films pacing is all over the place, it starts and doesn't stop. Perhaps that's due to the extremely short run time at one hour and twenty four minutes. The story is interesting I guess to say the least. Acting is passable. The dialogue and writing is at it's weakest. Also no memorable characters. It's no coincidence the actor and character that saved the previous film for me Steve Buscemi should should show up and give this film a speck of life. His only line made me laugh more than this entire film and its poor jokes could.The third act was I think the weakest part of the film. A poor attempt at a big final battle, End Game before End Game. But it didn't reach the heights I think they wished it to have. Toymaker played by Sylvester Stallone was a rather weak villain played well by Stallone but overall just weak. He had some funny lines and moments though I'll grant him that.I wouldn't say my childhood is tarnished but these last two films didn't age to well least of all this one.

So, what was so bad about it? I'll answer your question. It was the storyline. The story was way too spontaneous. There are many lines such as \"If you win, I'll get bonus points.\" What are the points for? There's another scene where the main character enters a race. The other characters say he must enter it to get to the next level. Where did this race come from? It just seems so shallow.

But after watching SPY KIDS 3-D: GAME OVER I have even less faith in the medium.   Why, oh why did this film have to be in 3-D?This film forgoes the kids in the title SPY KIDS and for the most part follows SPY KID Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara, Spy Kids), who's left the super secret OSS to start his own private investigation service.  He's content to save cats from the trees or discover why they've turned off the water at a local water park.  But when his sister Carmen (Alex Vega, Twister) gets trapped in video game designed to enslave all the children of the world. It's up to Juni to save her.The video game is designed by The Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone, Driven) a crazy man who has been trapped in cyberspace for many years.  The man who put him there, also lost the use of his legs doing it, is Juni's Grandfather (Ricardo Montalban, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn).  When Juni has him join the game will he seek his revenge?SPY KIDS 3-D is a lot of fun, it's vibrant and full of wonderful colors and detail.  It's also has director Robert Rodriguez's vivid imagination stamped all over it.  It's just to bad the 3-D glasses got in the way of enjoying a lot of it.There's a sequence on a racecar track, a giant robot battle arena and lot of other neat visuals.  But the rich details, the colors, and the story all have to take a back seat to the medium.  What good is 3-D if things don't fly here and there? The medium is wasted if you don't utilize this gimmick.\nWhile early scenes that don't use the 3-D look much more colorful, the moment you put on the glasses everything becomes a little murky.  Details that are essential to the pictures disappear and at least for me, I really wanted to see them.The story is also on cruise control.  This film is more like a series of action sequences than full fledge story.  Sure there's a plot, but it's inconsequential because of its target audience.  Kids who want to see boxing gloves and computer disks to fly at the screen.Also do not be fooled by top billing.  Antionio Bandaras, Carla Gugino, and Holland Taylor are in the film for mere minutes.  But gladly there are many other guests that drop by George Clooney, Elijah Wood, and some of Robert Rodriguez's old friends show up.  It's like an old family reunion.I must say Stallone also does an adequate job as The Toymaker.  He's funny and lighthearted, not a super-villian by any means, he's just crazy.  He also has to play three other characters, which he does quite nicely.  Is he back on the big screen for good?  Probably not, but it was nice to see him play with his on screen persona for a little while, anyway.I do not want to discourage you from seeing SPY KIDS 3-D: GAME OVER, at under 80 minutes it well worth the price of a Saturday Matinee.  Besides it's still by far one of the better children's franchises out there, and this one has enough laughs and thrills to keep you interested.  Also if you think 3-D works bad in the movies, it works even worse on TV.  So waiting for the DVD release probably won't help.For the most part I just longed to take those 3-D glasses off and immerse my self into the game.  Oh well, you can't have your way all the time.",

This is a family film, one geared specifically towards kids and parents who never really grew up. For the record, I thoroughly enjoyed this installment of the series; it's not the best of the bunch, but the 3rd installment is typically the weak link (can anyone say Return of the Jedi?)The setting of the film indeed owes a great debt to TRON, one that is repeatedly referenced in the dialogue and the action, and Rodriguez knew from the beginning that he would encounter resistance and problems with the red/blue process (watch Alan Cumming's intro to the film again, and you'll see what I mean), but the end product is a gorgeous piece of eye candy. It would've looked better in sequential field (IMAX) or polarised 3-D, but the market this film is aimed at isn't interested in spending the big bucks these processes require. The 3-D as it stands is amazingly effective (the mercury-like substance bouncing into the audience, the Mega Legs power-up in your face) and achieves great depth within its limitations.The performances widely vary, but this reflects the fact that the performers here are real kids, not the Hollywood brats we're used to seeing. Darryl Sabara was always the weaker of the Cortez siblings in terms of acting, but he's come a long way from the first film, and the film's revelation of the characters in the game being fantasy versions of their real-life counterparts was all too real and too funny.In short, this is a pleasant diversion that families can safely take their children to, with positive values that anyone can appreciate. When's the last time you saw a secular film that taught the importance of forgiveness without being preachy about it? If you can appreciate that little nugget, see this film.",

Sure, there is not much of a story. But I liked the jokes. I got a good laugh when they made a point to make fun of how everyone's eyes hurt when they have to take off 3-D glasses and re-adjust their vision. Most of the movie was an interactive video game. I've had fun watching people play certain video games, so this was just like that, but in 3-D, which again I say is a good enough gimmick to pay $10 to see.From what I do know about the previous 2 movies, I don't like the excessive amount of characters that had been used. If it's called Spy Kids, make the movie about the kids. And you can't go wrong with throwing Ricardo Montalban in there. There's no need for Spy Kids, Parents, Grandparents, Uncles, Cousins, Gardeners, House Pets, etc. So centering this on just the 2 kids and the grandfather makes more sense to me. I do have to say that although the cameos in this movie really made me laugh (particularly Elijah Wood), I can't help but feel a little confused by the final action sequence with all the cameos from characters that I ASSUME were in the first 2 movies. Having never seen the first two, I felt a little weirded out by a guy riding a pig. Maybe that would make more sense if I saw the first 2 movies. And Sylvester Stallone could've spent the whole movie on screen himself and I would've enjoyed it. He's hilarious and I laughed so hard at his impression during the end credit bloopers.",

            "content": "The only thing I hate more than an abomination of a movie is an abomination of a movie in 3D. So basically, you still get the abomination, except now you have random crap flying at your face at the same time. And this was back when theaters were using those annoying red-and-blue glasses that always made your eyes throb, so now it's an abomination with random crap flying at your face in variations of reds and blues that don't mix with each other. Wow, pass the popcorn. But don't think the graphics bombed because of the glasses. Even without the glasses, the graphics were pretty cheesy. Come on, the Tron/Speed Racer wannabe race practically smelt of cheddar. But we're just getting warmed up, because there's more! The acting reeked of inexperience, ironically coming from the cast who worked in the past Spy Kids movies, with a lot from those three weird players in the game and that girl in the purple suit. But the one who just stunk the most was the villain, who was played by Sylvester Stallone (What? Stallone acting badly? Whodathunkit?). But if that wasn't enough, Robert Rodriguez had to put in cameos of past characters at the end, which was kind of stupid because most of them didn't say anything or had anything to do with the movie. But everyone from the other movies had to come in for the absolutely boring and stupid ending so that the movie could stay true to the whole \"Family is Everything\" theme. But that just makes it so it's almost as if the characters just forgot what happened in the whole movie and everyone suddenly changed emotions and lived happily ever after. So, I guess all the mistakes have been covered, right? WRONG! The music sounded like it was played off a keyboard (it probably was), and that would be fine considering this is a movie about a video game, but it also had horns and violins that sounded so synthetic that it just screamed out \"We spent all the money on cheesy 3D graphics, so we had little to none left for the music!\" So, you name it, it sucked. Dialogue sucked. Acting sucked. Graphics sucked. 3D sucked. Ending sucked. Music sucked. But these are just examples of the thing that sucked the most: the directing. It was as if everything was thrown together with little effort. It certainly came off as if Robert Rodriguez thought that since people came to see the first two movies, he could just take a crap on green screen, put it in 3D, and people would come to see it. Well, in conclusion, this just a horrible film. The only things that are giving it a 2/10 are the cameos (even though they were just pointless) and the fact that the film at least had the decency to not put in any cheap fart/poop jokes. I really hope Mr. Rodriguez makes a better movie because I think he's a great director when he has the right chance or material (the same can be said for Mr. Stallone as an actor). But as for this movie, do not buy it, do not rent it, do not even watch it on TV if it's on. It is that bad.",

With the excellent 3D technology now available at places like Disneyworld (Orlando, Florida) and Sea World (Gold Coast, Australia), I thought that the world of 3D technology had come of age. However, the el cheapo cardboard glasses that were available for Spy Kids 3D were sub-standard and spoiled an otherwise quality movie.

            "content": "For some stupid reason, the makers of this movie decided to use the \"old way\" of creating a 3D effect -- red and green glasses. The \"new way\" (which isn't all that new) uses polarized filters, which allows all the colors to get through to both eyes. This is what they use at IMAX films and amusement parks, and the 3D effect is amazing, even frightening sometimes. So, since the 3D part is such a big deal in this movie -- heck, it's in the title -- why didn't they use the \"good\" 3D method?I suppose the polarized glasses are more expensive? Given the fact they were guaranteed to make money with this sequel, they should have spent the extra money for decent glasses. About fifteen minutes into the 3D portion of the movie my eyes were sore. Another person I talked to had the same problem.But! Even worse than the physical pain we had to endure, the colored glasses give you a movie with muddy colors and fuzzy 3D effects.Since the plot and characters took a backseat to the 3D effects, this was a serious flaw. Just like in the old 3D movies that ruined the genre decades ago, there is something flying out at you at every opportunity, and it gets tiring in a hurry. Especially since the 3D effect didn't work... because of the crappy glasses.Plot? Not really. Mostly they fumble around in a video game, doing meaningless things. I suppose a video game tie-in is imminent?Grandpa comes along and flits in and out of the picture, and pulls our heroes out of trouble several times. Our heroes don't need to worry, Grandpa is there. Deus ex machina, anyone?The whole thing culminates in a grand and unbelievable battle, which I won't spoil for you in case you do want to see this. Suffice to say, puny humans toppling skyscaper-sized monsters with karate kicks doesn't work for me.Characters? Funny, I don't remember any. That's probably because they were cardboard cutouts with mediocre acting from the kids and overacting from the adults. Surprisingly, Stallone did a good job as the villain and made the only interesting character. Go figure.The whole cast from previous movies returns for cameos. Banderas has the only memorable scene in the movie.It's too bad. The first movie was terrific because it showed there is a market for good non-animated family films, and it was an entertaining fantasy. The second was good too, for the same reasons. This one is a muddy-colored plot-challenged eyesore.My kid enjoyed it though, even if he was rubbing at his eyes at the end like me. There were some nice messages about the importance of family and people in wheelchairs. So I gave it a middling rating overall.",

The fact that it's really hard to get the 3-D effect to work when you wear glasses like I do doesn't help either.  The eye strain's bad as well with mine practically burning by the end.  I'd be waiting for the DVD where I could hopefully watch it normally, but there other problems that keep me being too excited.For a movie has which has a theme of counting on your family, there certainly isn't much family to be seen.  It feels like the title should have been \"Spy Kid: Juni's Big Adventure\" since he's the only one of the Cortezes to be seen for what seems to be about 80% of the runtime.  Grampa Montalban wanders in and out of proceedings seemly at random and doesn't do much to further the plot.  Carmen only enters the film near the end and seems to gotten a whole lot grumpier since we last saw her.  The rest of the family's parts are miniscule, basically glorified cameos.It seems like a lot of necessary footage was left on the cutting room floor and a lot of unnecessary stuff left in.  The reasons for Juni's situation at the beginning and what the Toymaker did in the past are barely even hinted at.  Along with the whole \"trapped in cyberspace for 30 years\" thing which doesn't make a whole of sense, an ending which makes no sense whatsoever, and endless action sequences with little point to them, it makes for a confusing and frustrating film which feels like it takes forever to end.I did enjoy Stallone in his first good part in ages and the reunion at the end was nice to see, but in the end I have to give this one a thumbs down.

It was a great family and kid film, that (as clich\u00e9 as it sounds) people of all ages could enjoy. Rob Rod really showed his range as a director. The child actors were charming, and the adult actors looked like they were having a good time making the film.And then there's this. Could a series really sour that fast? Heck, even SK 2, chock full of haphazard special effects and a hokey dance scene was better that this steaming pile.To put it simply, a good franchise was turned into a glitchy-vehicle for digital filming and 3D. The special effects were mediocre at best, the spark and charm of the first had been completely sucked out, and what was left a movie chock full of celebrity guest stars (who either chewed scenery with the ferocity of a lion like Stallone or were merely there like Banderas) with stuff flying of the screen at you (meaning that if you didn't see it in 3D, your left with television caliber special effects and Stallone eating a lounge chair).The kids were just as charming (well, Vega and Gugino were. The rest of them just stood around), so at least some quality from the first was still there.The plot was, well, pretty bad. I wasn't expecting The Godfather here, it's designed for kids. But, man, this was just annoying. Again, it was just a vehicle for the 3D gimmick; the plot leaped from A to H randomly and threw in Z for funsies: logic was effectively nonexistent. However, as haphazard as the plot was, the ending was truly horrendous. It was like RR just got bored with the movie and threw in robots and cameos at the end for kicks. All with sub-par CGI.After seeing at this film, I have a distinct feeling that the studio took away funding for the project and Rob Rod took over the whole production. But what I don't understand is the lapse in storytelling and quality. Obviously RR can effectively create good films flying solo: Look at Sin City and El Mariachi. So what happened?

Carmen (Alexa Vega), however, has gone on a mission to stop the evil Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone) from taking over the world. In order to stop him, Carmen must enter the game world in which the Toymaker is contained. Her mission comes to a halt when she is last seen on the fourth level. Even though her body is fine in the real world, the game has power over her mind and she must be rescued. Juni must return to his old spy ways in order to save his sister, beat the game and stop the Toymaker. Doing this requires him to complete the impossible level five.Depending on who you are, it is going to be either good or bad that the above paragraph explains just about the entire plot. The movie's script is mainly a springboard for what are, admittedly, some amazing visual sequences (the lava scene in particular was a wonder to behold). The problem, however, is that much of the wit and mass appeal of the first two is sidetracked by the need to present constant eye candy. It is an entertaining watch the first time, make no mistake about it, but as far as repeated viewing goes, many older (and by older I mean teens and up) folk will be bored. This film is definitely a kid's movie where as the first two Spy Kids films were only market as such and could be enjoyed by just about anyone of any age. The 3-D trick is fun, though, and I never suffered any adverse effects from the red and blue glasses. There are cues in the film that let you know when you are to take the glasses off to view scenes that are played in tradition 2-D (i.e. those scenes outside the game world).The acting is solid across the board and there is a bevy of celebrity cameos in the film. The children especially shine here as they have in the previous films. The standout here is Grandfather, played perfectly by Ricardo Montalban (`Fantasy Island'). He is given the best lines and his relationship with Juni is a highlight of the movie and made me yearn for more such relationships that were so key in the previous films. Rodriguez' direction is exciting as usual and he handles the challenges of 3-D very well, creating rich sequences throughout.Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over is the weakest of the series in terms of ability to appeal to a wide audience. Whether it was intentional or not, the movie focuses on entertaining the younger audiences and skips out on most of the winks at the older folks found during the first two films. Much of this is due to the inherent limitations of 3-D technology. Who wants to listen to exposition and learn about the characters when there could be giant robots leaping out of the screen? I will recommend this to all the kids I know but would caution parents to stick to the first two.",

Spy Kids 3 had probably less than fifteen minutes with the whole family. The plot was almost fresh, but old plot elements ruined it. The special effects were actually rather cheesy, and the acting somewhat less than satisfactory (a plot surrounding Carmen instead of Juni would have been better, since Alexa Vega is much better at acting than Daryl Sabara).The former two films poked fun at other films in ways that made viewers laugh out loud. I don't remember laughing at all during Spy Kids 3, and not because it was neccessarily more serious than the first two.As I said, the family as a whole gets probably less than fifteen minutes, while Daryl Sabara is on screen almost non-stop (by the end of the movie, you're begging for relief from his terrible acting). The cameos by Bill Paxton, George Clooney, Elijah Wood, and others are rendered stupid and pointless by the rest of the movie (though Elijah Wood's cameo was almost good enough to excuse the whole film. He obviously enjoyed the role he got).My advice: don't waste your time unless you're a rabid Elijah Wood fan.",

Rodriguez has turned the Carmen character into a \"cool\" and \"bad-ass\" teenager too fast so Vega looks kinda stupid in her role. It takes some of the charm out of the spy kids series...The plot, I thought, is a bit complicated for the little kids.

I only had one problem With Spy Kids 3D Game Over. Carmen and Juni should have had more in the movie together because the Spy Kids is Carmen and Juni. If Carmen and Juni had done more together by themselves, this movie would have been a hole lot better. I will buy this movie when it comes out, because from books, to soundtracks, to all of the Spy Kids Movies I have everything Spy Kids. That's how much I love the movie.If there ant going to be anymore Spy Kids, Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara should make more other movies together because they are wonderful together. Robert Rodriguez directing it could make that work, or some other director who may be a Spy Kid fan could come up with something. These Kids are really popular. I hope somebody comes up with something that will Star Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara In other Movies in the future.",

But if you just turn off your brain and watch this film it's quite the fun experience to have, it's so laughable and enjoyable at the same time.

Incredibly cheesy. Whatever! Few enjoyed TRON way back then - few can enjoy Spy KIDS 3-D now. This is the first movie in years (probably since TRON) that catches the Zeitgeist of our time: Video Games! I spotted many references to our society where kids grow up - not only with the TV-set but increasingly with interactive video games. Since the 1980s video games have become a great influence of our culture - this movie pays tribute to this development.I like the first Spy Kids movie, the second one is my favorite and the third part is a mixed bag. Take the 3-D aspect: some people say the movie is boring because it is not as interactive as video games are. What's that supposed to mean? When was the last time a movie motivated you to put on and off funny looking little 3-D paper classes? That's what I call inter-active. Finally the movie made a lot of fun of video games: take the great ride with the bikes for example: looks like a parody of F-ZERO.The strongest point of Sky KIDS 3-D is the innovation of actually bringing back 3-D in cinemas. This is a real achievement. The producers had to master technical problems, came up with a simple and wonderful solution and made the movie experience fresh once again. The little 3-D paper glasses worked just fine and some scenes in the movie really look fantastic.The only thing that turned me off was that the movie was too short - and most of the story and other actors were cut out of the movie. And it was not as funny as Spy KIDS and the Island of Lost Dreams.This movie isn't intended for the parents or adults, its target group is the children. I voted this movie 7 / 10 because all the kids in the cinema loved this movie. You just couldn't believe the energy in the crowd.",

Some of the individual scenes were modestly nifty effects showcases, but there is no coherence at all to the plot, and there is uniformly atrocious acting from most of the cast.

            "content": "*MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS*For me, the Spy Kids franchise has been a welcome change from the typical consumer pop-culture tv-adaptation trash churned out for children today (e.g. Lizzie McGuire Movie, the Rugrats and Thornberry movies, and the Pokemon movies) with films that have managed to ignite the senses and entertain all ages while avoiding cookie-cutter plots and blatant commercialism, problems all too common among today's Hollywood flicks.Spy Kids 3-D is, by far, the most energetic of the three movies, with fast-paced action that doesn't let up until the credits fly at you, 3-D style. It pays homage to a variety of films, such as Blade Runner and Tron, yet is able to stand on its own, despite similarities to the latter. It never takes itself too seriously, and, when shrapnel isn't flying at you or the breathtaking visuals aren't distracting your eye, the witty, throw-away dialogue will have you doubled back in laughter (or at least emitting a chuckle or two). The plot is intentionally shallow but plenty of fun, steering clear of Hollywood cliches (except when it is busy making fun of them) and the pretention that underlies most films meant for children. SK3D feels like it is the brainchild of a child, and is all the better because of it.SK3D's fun factor is off the scales, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys plenty of action and adventure with a good dose of humor tossed in. The only problem I had with the movie was the eyestrain one gets from wearing those tinted glasses for an extended period of time. But then again, I was in a really crappy seat when I viewed this, so perhaps it's just me.P.S. Though SK3D is essentially a film about a video game, throughout the movie Rodriguez quietly presents the message that video games can never take the place of real life, something that may not be lost by the techno-happy children that will probably be attending this flick.",

            "content": "I've seen all the other SK movies. I liked the first movie the best, and the second movie wasn't as good as the first but it's still good. However, the third movie was a disappointment compared to the others. #3 was average in my opinion. In the movie, Juni, working for himself, ends up getting hauled back to the OSS for a mission. Juni's mission is to shut down the hit video game called, well, \"Game Over\" and to save his sister from the Toymaker, the maker of the game. In order to do that, he must go to level 5, where you can shut the game off. There are references to games such as \"Tetris\", \"Metroid\", \"F-Zero\", and \"Halo\". The 3D segments were OK, but I like how IMAX does 3D better, rather that the ol' \"Red and Blue Lens\" concept of 3D movies from their 1950's heyday, since the 3D effect of IMAX 3D movies are closer to the audience and that you don't see nauseating red and blue that you must get used to. The movie was full of flaws. There weren't as much jaw-dropping concepts as there were in the others (all there was for concepts were the miniature sharks and \"Game Over\"). The 3D, though OK, wasn't as good as the 3D in IMAX 3D movies. Juni was slightly off-character (he isn't a dork that touches everything). The romance of Juni and a character from the game was odd. Grandpa is more of a hero in the movie than Juni, even though posters and previews showed Juni as the great hero. The last minutes of the movie with the big robot battle and Grandpa's reasoning with the Toymaker were crap. There were some scenes in the movie that were mushy and hokey (like the \"It's not about winning. It's about fun.\" line from the Toymaker, in my opinion, was nothing more than a throwaway line just to add in a moral). Everything was all flashy and stuff.\nI give this a 5 out of 10.The bottom line is that the third time is sort of not the charm, and if you want to see all of the Spy Kids movies, prepare to be dissapointed by the third movie after you see the others, though it was sort of OK in some ways.",

The film will not win awards, nor will it stand out as a major point in anyones career. It simply did it's job, and that was to entertain.To be honest, i think the film would have benefitted if it was not is '3-d'. Not only was the gimmick a distraction, it was also quite uncomfortable. I found myself turning away from the film on several occasions to rest my eyes. Only on a few occasions, did the 3-D actually work, most times it simply seemed to blur and look poop.The story is something that, as in most Rodriguez films, just takes a back seat to everything else. By the end of the film, you actually could not care less about the story. In fact, Rodriquez himself seems to through everything out of the window and end the film in the way he saw fit on that particular day of shooting. WARNING! If you have no imagination, or are'nt willing to let go of reality, then don't watch this film.There are some fantastic cameos from the Rodriquez 'family'. He even brigns in a certain member from The Faculty cast. I think the only member of the 'family' missing is Tarantino.This is deffinately one for fans of Rodriquez the kid and fans of the first two spy kid films inparticular.

I was surprised that Robert Rodriguez had written such a vapid pile.As what is trying to pass for a \"story\" opens, Juni (Daryl Sabara) has been off on his own for a while after feeling betrayed by the OSS. When he enters the game world to save his sister, one wonders how the heck he ever survived! He's completely helpless and useless! He gets nothing done unless someone steps in and grabs him by the hand. He doesn't affect anything in the story. Everything happens TOO him, not BECAUSE of him. The story is made up of one heavy-handed cliche after another. If you want to be entertained during the film, try and figure out how many movies in which you've heard all the cliched lines the characters seem to vomit forth with bulimic regularity. Believe me, they're ALL in there! The hackneyed script did nothing but accentuate the horrendous acting. Where the original \"Spy Kids\" proved, through their actions, that the family unit is important, this dreck pays it only lip service ad nauseam, so much so in fact, it makes one wonder if the Menendez brothers didn't have the right idea!Oddly enough, that's not the worst of it. 3-D technology has advanced impressively over the years as showcased in \"Captain EO\", \"It's Tough To Be A Bug\", \"T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous\" and \"Ghosts of the Abyss\". Apparently, no one told Mr. Rodriguez. His 3-D technique dates back to 1922 when it was first used! If he had heard of the advancements in the medium, the audience could have enjoyed the various primary colors that were used in the costumes and in the scenery not to mention that fact that it would actually have looked three dimensional. At best, the 3-D portions of the film were a muddy mess. Needless to say, I had to remove my glasses after some time - the movie itself was annoying enough.If you have the choice to see this movie or have extensive and painful oral surgery, visit the dentist - at least he'll give you a lollipop for your pain.",

SK and SK2 were a pair of rare movies where kids and parents could sit together and both be glad they came.Spy Kids 3D is a horrible, wretched waste of celluloid that is a betrayal to the fans and nothing more than a cheap ploy to exploit a successful, quality series for a pile of cash.  Despite the fact that the movie is in \"3D\" (gee, I seem to remember seeing pictures of people wearing 3D glasses in the '50's), the production values are terrible and the plot is basically non-existent.  The cheap 3D glasses will give you a headache and blur the film more than they provide a unique viewing experience.The basic plot is this: Juni Cortez, played by Daryl Sabara (apparently the only original cast member willing to invest more than 15 minutes in the creation of this dreck) jumps into a video game to save his sister. He takes Grandpa with him.That's about it.  There are so many plot holes and logical dead ends that in the end, just face the fact that since this is a formula movie, the good guys will win after an hour or so of headache-inducing semi-animated action.In the end, we see about a minute each of the remaining cast members from the previous movies.  Their presence is barely explained, and their contribution to the climax is questionable (after each gets his/her cameo, they're pretty much out of the rest of the movie).Finally, I do have to say that my seven-year-old was enthralled and probably would have given the movie a 10.

Unfortunately, the process still has not been perfected.  Stereo-optic viewing is best in short stretches, but there is little time to adjust in this film.The story is uneven.  The script starts out strong, with Junie (Daryl Sabara)called back into service to stop the evil Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone) from enslaving the world's children with a video game.  As long as the action stays in the game, the story is plausible.

Lots of gimmicks, not much plot or character -- which also easily makes this Spy Kids the most disappointing of them all, in a way. *HOWEVER*, if you can get past Syl Stallone's non-emoting as the bad guy, the fact that Alexa Vega is barely involved, and ignore the muddled plot (which is there only to get you to the next 3D set piece anyway), then you're in for a real treat. The 3D, for the most part, looks *amazing*. And, again, Robbie R. has done a fantastic job of encapsulating the cheesiness of the bygone era of '50s 3D film, in a strangely pleasant and compelling way.Overall, this was much more fun than the Matrix sequel despite its warts. Hope the series really does die here, because its really starting to show its seams.  That said, it's a not bad way for an adult to spend 90 minutes. Some really hilarious cameos and good jokes that will fly over the heads of its intended audience. All around good fun for kids of all ages. A must-see in the theater, that's for sure.",

I got a giggle out of the Tetris pieces used to make platforms, and out of how much one of the actresses resembled the artwork for the heroine of every one of the Final Fantasy video games...kind of appropriate.The child actors were, in general, surprisingly watchable - I would've liked to have seen more of Alexa Vega in the film, honestly - and Ricardo Montalban and Sylvester Stallone were well matched against each other. They had to be, really, because despite top billing for Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino, they were barely on screen long enough to be noticed.\nBut the eye candy and the generally good acting couldn't make up for the overall level of stinky, stinky CHEESE that makes up the bulk of the film. I had the feeling that a couple big chunks of the film were missing - some exposition at the beginning would have been nice, and the resolution of the \"video game\" part of the movie felt very, very rushed. The video game plotdevice itself is...umm...let's say it overloaded my disbelief suspender, and the overall tone of the movie was beyond absurd, a real disappointment in light of the first movie in the franchise. And the final scene seemed to just be an excuse to get every adult who'd ever gotten camera time in the first two films another 15 seconds in front of the camera.My five-year-old loved it, of course, but I wish we'd waited to see it in second run.",

            "content": "Don't ask me how I ended up watching all three spy kids movies (little cousins is my story, and i'm sticking to it!!) but they went too far with this one.I enjoyed number 1, where the concept was fairly outlandish and the characters added to the fun of it all. Number 2 I have mixed feelings about. An older Vega (Carmen) and Sabara (Juni) seemed to come into their role more than 1, but the film lacked the punch of the first. Number 3- oh dear.Before I start, I'm going to give Robert Rodriguez some credit on three scores. (1) He takes technological risks (high percentage of green screen, HD film, 3D) that many film directors either would try or haven't quite discovered. (2) His loyalty to actors such as Banderas, Gugino, Clooney etc, is commendable in an industry that constantly recycles and trades in talent for newer, fitter, funnier, sexier. (3) He has a strong sense of moral value in trying to encourage kids to stick by and look to their families, which i thought was commendable.Commendation over. First, we'll give them the fact that it was deemed necessary for Juni to enter the game world. But many things didn't work in the film (the life scoring system, for one) that computer game players of even the weirdest fantasy game would know happens in computer games. Second, the ridiculous cameo's. I let them off with Clooney twice. But Clooney isn't the issue. Salma Hayek (Donnagon's wife)? Sly Stallone (Toymaker and about another three or four sub characters)? You know it's bad for Hayek if she's not in the credits (unless i missed that). Why? What did either cameo add to the film? Third, the plot. What plot? Kid goes in game, somehow saves earth too. If i wasn't so lost by the amount of subplot, i would have found it predictable. Four, lack of ending (my favourite hang-up). That was slightly unpredictable, but doesn't end up in total banishment of bad guy, which begs the question \"was there a real purpose to what preceded this moment?\" I don't think so at all. Five, the filmmakers took away performance from two of the actresses that made the first two films half decent- Vega and Gugino. Not only was there no discernible reason for omitting them from most of the film, but they cut the two most believable characters out of what was, at best, a workable concept.( and that's at best.) Lastly, Whereas Spy Kids 1 followed Spy Kids 2 in a logical order, Spy Kids 3 seemed way off the scale and didn't connect properly.But the main thing is, my cousins liked it, right? Interesting questions- Will Rodriguez try this genre again with a new concept? Will Vega try her hand at a J.Lo style singer/actress career with any success? Will Hayek land another big role in the future? Will filmmakers ever realise that too many sequels spoil the industry? Worryingly, i fear all the answers may end in \"No\".",

The 2nd one was ok, getting a little worse, and as the tagline says, \"Slightly Bigger Spies.\" This was just plain out stupid for several reasons. The really only person that came from the last 2 throughout the whole movie was Daryl Sabara aka Juni Cortez. Alexa Vega aka Carmen Cortez was in the last 20 minutes or so, and was sleeping most of the movie away. Ricardo Montalban aka Grandfather was in the last one and probably had the 2nd most screen time.The idea of Spy Kids is starting to really unoriginal and not new especially since they keep pumping a movie out once a year. Think about Star Wars, their movies come out once every 3 years, James Bond, once every 2 or 3 years. As Rater #2 says perfectly, they're preteens now or in Alexa's case, she is a teen.The 3-D aspect of the film bothered me. I didn't like wearing the glasses because a) They're not like the ones at Disney World and Universal being the same color, and b) They were blue and red, which distorted my field of vision. I don't have glasses (contacts instead), so that didn't really bother me. The thing was I couldn't see any 3-D effects. Maybe there's something wrong with my vision, but 3/4 people I was with said they couldn't see any effects at all. Most of the stuff flying at us were nuts and bolts. I didn't hear anyone gasp when something was flying at me.Daryl did an ok job as his part. I think he was better in the first movie, but this movie was directed more around him. Alexa didn't really do much, as she was sleeping most of the movie. I loved Stallone's Rocky movies, but I swear that I didn't recognize him at all in this one. The rest of the cast was put it for 2 seconds worth and it was a rather waste of money and time. They were on for 2 seconds. Just 1 dumb question, why was Elijah Wood in here serving up 2 minutes of screen time? Why? Though I thought it was funny when he got killed. I'm the Guy, zap! 99 lives down to .5, uh oh, 0. Bye bye. I didn't really recognize George Clooney either...\n1 last thing.  Why were all the bad guys good in this one?  I thought they all went to jail or something.Well, besides blowing $8.50 on a movie that I really didn't exactly want to see, I think it was probably, for the most part wasted. 6/10's of it was at least.",

All the things that movie aficionados might pick this movie apart for don't matter to the target audience, and shouldn't. It's just a fun time. My 10yo daughter's only complaint was that they didn't use the *good* 3D effects like at Walt Disney World.As far as the Tron reference goes, I know it will offend some \"true believers,\" but all in all SK3-D is much easier to follow. We rented Tron so my daughter and I could watch it and compare, and there's a whole lot of geek stuff that needs to be explained in order for it to make sense to a mainstream audience. SK3-D is so much more accessible because just about every kid out there understands videogames, lives, cheat codes, and all the other things that were mentioned. You didn't have to be a geek to get it.And who knows - maybe one day, after having seen and appreciated SK3-D, some of the kids who enjoyed it will stumble across Tron and recognize it just as kids who grew up on The Lion King have begun to recognize Hamlet.",

The original Spy Kids was cute, enjoyable and, if not totally original, well done. The Sequel was predictable but still enjoyable and well done. Nothing in this movie is original, it is predictable and subject to bad production. The best thing about this movie is Sylvester Stallone playing a bad guy (in a kids movie) and talking to representations of himself. That should tell you how bad this movie is.All is not bad with this movie. Daryl Sabara is actually quite good. I'd like to see him in some really challenging role. I think he's ready to break out of his kid's roles. He'll never be a Haley Joel Osment, but I think he could do more. Alexa Vega looks bored with the whole thing, and I can't say I blame her. She too could use a good break out.Reuse of an old idea can be flattering, but not when it comes off worse than the original. The special effects of Tron are primitive compared to today's movie making standards, yet the Light Cycle race in Tron is much more exciting than the cycle race in SK3D.The 3D effects, at least at the theater I saw the movie at, were absolutely awful. Maybe it was the cheap glasses, but the colors were wiped out, there were color registration problems and the 3D did not pop like it should. If you've ever been to Disneyworld, or other major theme park, and seen 3D well done, you know what I am talking about. The chorography relied too heavily on the 3D effect to be really interesting, especially when the effect was not there. I tried really hard, but I could find no justification for this movie to be done in 3D.Unlike the movie, I know when things should end. There are a lot more bad things about this movie, but I think you get the idea: this movie is bad; avoid it all costs. Two Stars and Two Thumbs Down.",

This movie felt like a long saturday morning show. Maybe like a TV movie, the ones based on a current series. Not because of the effects, but because it comes off like a rushed production. After all, Robert is making one of these a year.Which is fine..he will continue to get my money multiple times at the theaters. Just don't let them slip past this level Robert and go stinko ala Austin Powers.As far as the movie..well Juni is my favorite character and the film is about him and a bit about grandpa. So I was interested. Stallone is a stinker of an actor, even at this campy, tongue in cheek level. He is actually better as an actor in DRIVEN then here.

Robert Rodriguez never used the plot other than to say 'hey, what if we can throw in some bad 3-D and sell lots of tickets?'Playing the game, a VR game called 'Game Over', playing it through to the end, could have been a pretty good movie, with the bad guy and the lost Carmen at the final confrontation. But instead, Junie and his band of VR enthusiasts, with Grampa at his side, simply go from one level to another pointlessly, without even the pretense of difficulty.Good points: Montalban's character is in a wheelchair, but when he joins Junie in VR he can walk. A few nice touches with that. And Sylvester Stallone as the Toymaker and the various incarnations of the Toymaker's fractured personality was humorous.I think it was quite misleading to put Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino as stars of the film when their roles were actually so small as to be an afterthought.Maybe Rodriguez wanted to make the third film before the kids grew up too much, but another month or two writing a real script wouldn't have made much of a difference.Bottom line:Don't waste your time.

I know movie producers mistake the public for idiots, but I never thought the producers could be THIS condescending.A few good things about the movie:(1) Ricardo Montablan and Sylvester Stallone did their best with what was given and gave perfectly acceptable performances in their given role;(2) Good message about spending too much time in front of a video game versus experiencing real life and being with family - this was the main reason why I did not vote SK3 a 1.(3) It was only 75 minutes long.Unfortunately, the crap outweighs the message being sent.  There are better movies that could either give the same family-friendly message (Disney's PIXAR movies come to mind) or allow the viewer to vicariously view life inside a machine (TRON).3 out of 10.",

This type of 3D is simply a pain to watch; I got a headache after about 10 minutes, and my daughter actually got motion sickness.Unless you are a young boy or a video game enthusiast, this film is also quite boring until the end.  The plot involves young Juni Cortez (Daryl Sabara) going \"inside\" a video game (an idea done to death with such films as \"Tron\") to rescue his sister.  Although Sabara and other child actors deliver fine performances, the video game adventure is far too long and gets very dull.  The only amusing moments occur at near the conclusion of the film, when several fine adult actors (Antonio Banderas, Bill Paxton, George Clooney, and others) make very brief but funny appearances, including a laugh-out-loud joke from Ricardo Montalban that refers to his old car commercials.I cannot recommend this film to anyone, as the 3D is too poorly done and too irritating to watch.",

This movie is known for a having a great cast which have had the unfortunate bad luck of staring in this film. I tell you this film would of been a lot better if only the directors were real men and not hipster men, I tell you Melbourne has a real representation in this film.It was clear the directors were cracking a fat over the actors. though the cast did not clearly have a lack of talent. This movie would clearly see a much needed increase of appeal in the 90's any reviewer that has gone and given this movie a good review has been payed off and is telling porkies.Anyway I particularly liked the scene were the kid made the other kids brain fart as that is quality television. It could be seen in one scene that the actors were jerking the mutton knocking about for a paycheck. The animation quality is awful for the budget of the film. In all honesty this film makes me wish I had died off during the Emu War.",

Also, it was a pain because you couldn't take your glasses off and watch the film at the same time because then you'd be seeing double of everything on the screen!!! I really do wonder how they're going to bring it out on video & DVD. It would spoil the whole collection if they just didn't bring it out at all! It would,of course, still be a great family film to watch without the 3-D affect. Overall, a good film to watch but it will never beat that IMAX Cinema feeling!

Ostensibly a film for children, it has been cobbled together merely to showcase some - admittedly stunning - effects and earn a few more bucks for the studio. But a story? A plot? Something memorable the young ones can re-tell their friends a school?Zilch. The premise was good - children trapped in a computer games- but it isn't worked out in the slightest and makes absolutely no sens. As for the cynicism, Sly Stallone gets to play the baddie, except that he isn't a baddie, and it is never explained why he should be thought bad. And anyway, in the end he comes good. Puke. For Sly regards it as an oppertoonity to demonstrate his range - that's he's not all wham, bam - and that, hey, he can do hoomur as well as the best. Actually, he can't.Elswhere, there are one or two jokes, but each is so archly knowing, so pitifully post-ironic that any kid under 12 won't get them and adults will simply applaud such a 'sophisticated script for the kids' and pat themselves on the back for getting the joke.As I say, cynical. In addition we get the full range of politically correct attitoods - too many computer games are bad for you, the disabled as just as good as you and me, love will conquer all, on the inside we are all worthy somehow - you get more or less the full PC set. But why these attitudes are worthy is anyones's guess: we are simply presented with them and that is that.One major 'message' is that The Family is all-important. Quite why is never explained or justified, and the film runs a real risk of allienating rather than engaging today's generation of pre-teens and teens. Which family should I be loyal to, ask confused kids who have two moms, three dads and a series of uncles as divorce rates continue apace and new families are spawned by the minute.Finally, of course, there is the cynicism of heralding Antonio Banderas as the star when he is on screen for a full eight minutes. This is all a real shame after the first Spy Kids which, they not great, at least gave the children their OWN film rather than something for the child in us to enjoy. Which this one didn't.

The glasses were uncomfortable and the lace at the back broke every 5 minutes.  Not only that but the actually 3D was poor as well.  It just didn't work, none of the 3D images actually came out of the screen... it looked as though it just stopped before it left the screen.

I credit Robert Rodriguez for keeping the cast and the film light, and for using the 3D effects usefully but I do say that he does go over board in certain scenes in the movie. The film also gives too many of the same messages that we already said in the first two but considering that this is a family film, i don't mind it too much.

This one, however, turned out to be just fine for me, even though they have the same type of gadgets, but this time they are in a video game, which makes the film more believable.Some of the high-speed special effects appeared more video-gamey than real life, but that was also acceptable because it is a video game. Ideas from Star Wars Episode I Racer video game and Danny Kaye's The Inspector General (1949) made it very amusing, and seeing Elijah Wood for a few hilarious moments was a plus It also showcased the acting talents of Ricardo Montalban, Sylvester Stallone and George Clooney, who are normally known more as action heroes than good actors.

The black and white glasses are used and that makes the experience that much more enjoyable. This type makes your eyes feel as if they were bleeding.  Also that old school 3D is annoying to look at because you always see the red and blue lines.

The plot was shallow and disjointed.  It was almost as if someone sketched out an outline of what they wanted the story to be and filmed - forgetting to add the meat in between. You never really knew (nor did the characters) what they were doing or why.The story starts with Juni doing his own thing - no longer part of the spy network.  (What happened to working together as a family?)  Then he gets talked into coming back to the OSS to save his sister, who's mind has been trapped in a computer game.  To save her, Juni has to enter the game and win his way through to the 4th level to free her.  Once he gets inside, he is allowed to have one family member come in to help him and he picks grandpa (Ricardo Mantalban).  Unfortunately, Juni really has no idea what he is supposed to do.  And it's grandpa who keeps appearing at the last moment to help him out of the jams.  Unfortunately, Juni never is enlightened - nor is the audience.  Then, instead of actually being creative, they end the whole mess with a grand finale by bringing in every character they could from the first two movies.  It just didn't make any sense!To be fair, I have to say that the actors did try.  The had energy and really tried to make it work but it's really hard to work with something that just isn't there!

This movie employed the tired red/blue glasses which were offered for the Creature from the Black Lagoon made in 1954.  The effect was minimal at best, the colors were washed out, my left eye (red) was much darker than my right eye, and I kept lifting my glasses to see if there was any difference.  There was little, the most being without the glasses the colors were much better even though the images had little blue and red halos around them.

Of course you don't because Stallone can't do comedy, shouldn't even try, he's an embarrassment to himself. I can't believe this man ever WON an Oscar. Really this movie is all about Juni, and everyone else has a cameo, his parents,his sister, George Cloony, etc they are all cameos. Why? I believe the other actors (except for Juni and Stallone) were too embarrassed to do more but must have been forced by contract to appear.

This being said some people will hate this movie, just because they don't like it's character. And some people will love it, because they love it's character. I happen to be of the latter inclination.Spy Kids 3-D keeps much of the original spunk and funky humor that made the first and second installments so endearing to me, as well as the token appearance by Steve Buscemi. In fact, celebrity cameos positively litter the film, from Salma Heyek and Antonio Banderas to George Clooney and that Sylvester Stallone person. And here's the killer, Daryl Sabara out shines them all. In fact, the kids are the best part of the cast, plus the end credit song performed by Alexa Vega is priceless, you wonder when she's going to release her own album. (There is also another cameo, who is only on screen for a total of a few minutes towards the end, but is impossible to miss. I won't tell you who it is, except to say that if you don't recognize him you have probably had your head under a mountain for the past two years.)The storyline is simple, but effective, with all the fun of the Matrix-like pseudo reality, and at the same time poking fun at all sorts of genres, including action/adventure gaming. The highlight of this for me is the MegaRace, which, with out revealing too much, can only be described as the mother of George Lucas's Pod Race in Episode I: The Phantom Menace. You'll see.The largest complaint I have heard, from the reviewers standpoint, seems to be disappointment on the 3-D's behalf. True, those glasses did give me a bit of a head ache, and yes, those GLASSES ON/GLASSES OFF messages did get a little annoying, but all in all I found the movie to be quite the enjoyable experience.

            "content": "Before this movie was released, Robert Rodriguez announced that it would be the last \"Spy Kids\" movie.  He's made a wise choice, because \"Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over\" is the least successful movie in the franchise, with its strong elements undone by a tacked-on ending that brings the series to a much less glorious conclusion than it deserved.The basic plot of the movie is simple enough to state, and it picks up where the prior movie ended: Juni (Daryl Sabara) has renounced his job as a \"spy kid\" in the top-secret OSS, only to learn that his sister Carmen (Alexa Vega) is trapped on Level 4 of a virtual-reality video game created by the evil Toymaker (Sylvester Stallone).  Juni agrees to \"enter\" the game in an effort to rescue his sister, but he must succeed within the 12 hours before the game is commercially released.  With the help of his grandfather Valentin (Ricardo Montalban), three beta testers (who think Juni is \"The Guy\" described in the users' manual who can take you to Level 5 of the game if you stick with him), and a somewhat mysterious girl named Demetra (Courtney Jines), Juni succeeds in rescuing Carmen and reaching Level 5, where everyone may end up trapped by the Toymaker.  Ultimately, of course, Juni and Carmen save the day, and all is right with the world, even if there isn't a winner or a loser.The movie actually works very well until the characters exit the video game, although it is a little reminiscent of \"Tron.\"  Despite Roger Ebert's much-publicized aversion to 3D, the gaming scenes are quite impressive, without the \"headaches\" that used to come from old-style 3D.  Kudos to James Cameron for the new 3D system.  Also, Rodriguez does a great job pulling good performances from actors stuck on the artificial blank backgrounds of the 3D soundstage.  His video game sequences capture the gaming feel without getting bogged down in game details -- and contain plenty of action as well. Oh, and his special effects look great, as usual.Unfortunately, it feels as if Rodriguez only wrote enough movie to get the characters into Level 5 and then ran out of time, energy, money or willpower to give them the ending that they deserved.  Instead, he tacks on a nonsensical ending that gives him a chance to get cameos from most of the stars of the first two films, including Carmen and Juni's parents, but brings the movie to a disappointing conclusion better reserved for Saturday-morning TV.Daryl Sabara does a decent job of carrying the film, but the surprise of the movie is Courtney Jines.  My daughter, who saw the movie before I did, came home raving about the girl Juni meets, and I understood her reaction when I saw the movie myself.  Alexa Vega is only in a small portion, but she does get to sing two songs in the extended end credits.  One small treat: if you stay to the very end, after the neverending credits, you get to see snippets of Daryl and Alexa's original audition tapes from 1999 ... and you can see for yourself that it's hard for Daryl and Alexa to be spy \"kids\" much longer.",

            "content": "For the past 10 years I have seen just about every kid's movie that has come out and this one was probably the most disappointing.  I enjoyed the first two \"Spy Kids\" movies, but this one lost much of it's charm by reducing the screen time for Alexa Vega(Carmen), Antonio Banderas(Dad) and Carla Gugino(Mom).  The best part of the first two movies was the interaction between these characters and Daryl Sabara(Juni).The 3D was also disappointing.  The film was too dark with the glasses on and the cardboard was uncomfortable on my nose.  My son even commented after it was over that the 3D movies we had seen in Disney World and other places were much better.The good points in this movie were Ricardo Montalban(Grandfather), Courtney Jines(Demetra) and the surprise appearance of Elijah Wood(The Guy).  In fact, the only time I laughed out loud was when The Guy showed up like the knight in shining armor and then quickly met his demise.\nTo sum it up, it was still enjoyable for children if not for their parents, and parents should be pleased with the values it tries to show at the end of the film.",

            "content": "It could have been much, much better. It just seemed rushed. I actually thought the first two Spy Kids films were innovative and enjoyable, with credible storylines, but the plot just never happened in this one. Obviously, they just built the 3D scenario round the computer game, and attempted to run a story of sorts around it. Instead of a crescendo to the trilogy, it became a whimper! Most of the time, I was trying to get a 3D image through the glasses - not as clear as they expected. The fight scene near the start of the game, between the virtual reality robots, was probably the best bit of the special effects. Saying all of that, the youngster that played Juni (Daryl Sabara) did quite well in his lead role and was not as monotonous-sounding as his previous two efforts. Carmen (Alexa Vega) hardly featured until the final 20 minutes, which was a big disappointment since she had carried the previous two films in the series. The remainder of the characters filled just a cameo role. Stallone, as the Toymaker, was awful. And at the end, it was far too much of a cringe to take any notice! Perhaps I should have seen the Terminator instead.",
