            "content": "25th Hour is a movie that I just came across one day and decided to rent it, I noticed that it had Edward Norton in it and figured that I would just give it a shot. I absolutely fell in love with Edward Norton when I saw American History X, he immediately became one of my favorite actors. I couldn't believe how much I fell in love with this movie, it's honestly one of my new favorite movies, it's intelligent, intense, and greatly written. Edward Norton pulls off an incredible performance and truth be told I couldn't believe he didn't get a nomination at least for this movie, I don't know 25th Hour just didn't get enough notice, but this is a great movie and a very moving story.Monty Brogan is walking the streets of New York with Doyle his dog. He goes to his old school where he meets up with his teacher friend Jacob Elinsky and discusses a get-together at a local club planned later that evening. Elinksy then calls Frank Slaughtery who is working as a Wall Street trader. Brogan then goes home to his girlfriend Naturelle and they discuss the fact that this is his last night before prison. Brogan has been busted for being a drug dealer, and he is looking at seven years in Otisville prison. Brogan visits his father James at his Irish pub, and his father blames himself for Monty getting into the position he's in. Brogan and his father then discuss whether it was Naturelle who tipped off the police about him. The group later meets at the club, Jacob runs into one of his students, Mary who we see before complaining to Jacob about the grade of one of her papers. She goes with them into the club. Frank and Naturelle also discuss how Monty got to this position, but Frank accuses her of not doing anything because she got used to a fancy life. Monty and his partner Kostya then go to speak to a group of Russian mobsters, run by Uncle Nikolai. Nikolai gives Monty some tips on how to survive in prison. Then it is revealed who really was the traitor that tipped the police about Monty.25th Hour is also the movie that introduced me to Rosario Dawson and I have to tell you that I fell for this girl immediately, she's a great leading actress who has a strong presence on the screen. In fact the entire cast is something to admire in this movie: Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Anna Paquin and Barry Pepper. Then we have this incredibly intense scene that is one of my favorite in movie history, when Edward Norton is in the bathroom and goes off blaming everyone else for his problems then finally breaks down and just says \"F you, you had it all and you screwed it up\", that scene went from funny to intense to just plan sad. This was also the fist movie that also brought up the pain and aftermath in New York after 9/11, the opening scene was in fact showing the lights that represented where the towers once stood and you really felt the pain and emptiness of New York. Honestly I would say this is Spike Lee's best film, it's not bitter or over the top and made this film perfectly. If you have the opportunity to see this movie, I highly recommend that you take it, it's such a terrific story and is one of the most effective of 2002.10/10",

            "content": "'I tattooed 'survive' on my hand the night before I went away to prison. And I did. We do what we have to do to survive.'I don't think I can remember a film that has put me more on an emotive level with the main character as this film has. Edward Norton plays Monty Brogan \u0096 he's not the nicest of people by anyone's standards \u0096 and certainly no one you should feel sorry for. But having said that, I have never felt so sorry for the bad guy as I did watching this film. We watch the anguish of Monty during his last 24 hours on the 'outside' before he must go to prison for seven years, knowing completely what is in store for him on the 'inside'.Set in post 9/11 New York City, we are constantly reminded of humanity and the need to bond together and to make the most of the little time we have; as do Monty's friends, including Jacob Elinsky (Hoffman), a confused and self-tortured school teacher who has strong feelings for one of the students in his class, Mary (Paquin \u0096 of X-Men and The Piano fame). Although not about to die, Monty's world is about to turn severely bad, and there's nothing he can do about it. Norton's performance made me feel nervous and quite scared on his behalf, almost to the point of feeling nauseous. It made me want to forgive him, forget about his crimes and let him go (he seemed sorry for what he did \u0096 he was no longer a drug dealer \u0096 he was trying to make an effort). His performance worked. He had successfully transformed the criminal figure into your best mate and buddy, perhaps even yourself, and you genuinely feel sorry for him.Director Spike Lee's films usually deal with African-American themes, so it came as a surprise to me to find that this film was something very different \u0096 proving that Lee's talent extends across multiple genres and styles.I highly recommend 25th Hour, not just for the brilliant story, but for the emphatic feelings the film imparts on the viewer.",

            "review_title": "One of Spike's best",
            "content": "This is definitely Spike Lee at the top of his game!  `25th Hour' is a purely character-driven drama filled with engaging, complex characters and sharp dialogue.  I like how Spike allowed the scenes to play out, without being too concerned about dampening the pacing.  I'm sure some will complain (and this probably explains why it wasn't a big success) that the film is boring and slow-moving.  If they do, that's probably because audiences are so used to watching movies with a million cuts in one scene, and more time emphasized on action and sex scenes than character development.  The characters were so well-developed that I felt a deep connection with each of them.  It's rare nowadays that I really get sucked into a film, and this was one of those rare cases.  It might also have to do with the fact that I'm familiar with many of these types of characters in real life.  You have the Barry Pepper character, who's this smooth-talking playboy who ends sleeping with a ton of women, despite the fact that he's harsh and not very likable. And there's the Philip Seymour Hoffman character, who's a lonely, average-looking guy, who's alienated from society because he doesn't look like an Adonis.  It's a harsh reality that handsome guys with nice bodies get away with being complete jerks and still maintain an active dating life, while average-looking guys can have great personalities and women will be repulsed by them, but it is indeed a reality.  Sure, it isn't right for Hoffman to be lusting after one of his underage students, but I'm sure if he were ten times better looking, people wouldn't be as disgusted-because God knows that teachers sleeping with their students is sweeping the globe like an epidemic.    The approach to these character interaction scenes is almost documentary-like, which adds to the film's engaging qualities.  I love the scene between Pepper and Hoffman, where they chat about dating and Pepper describes his buddy as being part of the 62nd percentile, in the dating world.  Sometimes it doesn't work when you deviate from the main characters to focus on the supporting characters, but in this film it did, being that they're very essential in Monty's life and it's helpful to allow the audience to know them inside and out.  The acting is terrific.  Edward Norton is always brilliant.  But the supporting cast is just as strong.  Barry Pepper is a wonderful actor as well, and it's interesting to find out that he's from Vancouver, yet he convincingly inhabits the character of a true New Yorker.  Brian Cox is only in the film for about 20 or 30 minutes, but his appearances are very memorable, and he is absolutely magnificent.  After seeing him in this movie, I must add him to my list of favorite underrated actors.  It's ironic that he shows up in practically every other film, yet he never gets the recognition he deserves.  Hopefully, one day he will.  Even Tony Siragusa impressed me.  I'm not hugely familiar with him, but I saw him make a guest appearance once on `The Tonight Show,' and he seems like a cool guy with a good sense of humor, but I wasn't sure how he'd pan out in a serious dramatic role.  Well, he is great, and pulls off the Ukrainian accent with hardly a hitch.  I also liked how his character would mess up on his English every once in a while, instead of these foreign characters in movies who speak perfect English, only with an accent.  I'm always  proud to see Philip Seymour Hoffman, who never fails to impress.  One reason I'm so drawn to him is because-like me-he's an average-looking guy, yet he receives decent roles and doesn't get typed as the `fat slob' like most actors in his weight range.  So I think of him as an inspiration to all overweight aspiring actors.  I once read a review for `Magnolia' in which someone bashed him for being so ugly.  Of course, this person didn't mention anything about his acting, but that just proves how superficial of a society we live in today. Many audiences are so used to seeing actors and actresses with near-perfect faces and near-perfect bodies that they can't stand to see actors who look like `normal people.'  How often do you walk outside and see people who look like Tom Cruise and Gwyneth Paltrow?  Even these so-called reality shows try to include the most beautiful people possible.  So people get hypnotized into thinking that's reality.  I'm a heterosexual man, so naturally I'm open about enjoying the sights of beautiful actresses, but that's not going to impact how I feel about their acting abilities.  And the sight of beautiful women alone surely doesn't make a film good (i.e.:  `Charlie Angels'). Speaking of beautiful women, wrapping up this talented cast are Anna Paiquin and Rosario Dawson.  Paiquin is cute and effective in her role, though technically it's similar to the ones she played in `HurlyBurly' and `It's the Rage.'  I just hope she doesn't get typecast as the teenage slut who loves sleeping with older men.  But she's a fine actress, and despite these similarities, she takes different approaches to each of her characters. Rosario Dawson just gets hotter and hotter by the movie.  When I saw that trailer shot where she's dancing in the club in that silver dress, I couldn't help but think to myself, `I'd give my left leg to marry that girl.'  Well, I'm glad to see that she receives good roles that compliment her acting abilities.  She really has a commanding screen presence, outside of her outstanding beauty.  I only have two minor criticisms about the film.  One is the unnecessary `F.U. sequence' where Norton goes on a blue streak about his hatred for the people of NYC and the world in general.  I'm sure many will find deep meaning in that sequence, but I felt it was out of place and simply an opportunity to remind people that this is a Spike Lee joint-since it's identical to the race-bashing montage in `Do the Right Thing.'  Spike mentioned in the commentary that the scene was in the screenplay, and adapted from the original novel, but I'm sure he thought of it as a perfect opportunity to insert one of his directorial trademarks.  My other criticism is the use of flashbacks.  Nowadays, some directors feel that dissolving into flashbacks and showing subtitles that read things like `Three years earlier' is passe, but the audience needs some sort of clue that we're going back in time.  In the scene where Dawson and her friend are in the playground, and Norton first meets her, is obviously a flashback since Dawson is wearing a Catholic private school uniform.  But there are other scenes that I didn't realize were flashbacks until I watched the movie with Spike's commentary.  But even without knowing those scenes were flashbacks, I didn't feel thrown off, so that's always a good sign.    \nBesides the `F.U. sequence,' there were other Spike trademarks, which I felt worked out well, like his famous dolly shot.  The movie is long, but not overlong.  As I said, this is Spike at the top of his game.  I'm personally a fan of most of his work, even the awfully bashed `Summer of Sam.'  Other fans should also be impressed.  Hell, even if you're not a Spike Lee fan, you should appreciate this film!  It's a smartly written, well-acted, character-driven drama that doesn't come along too often. \nMy score:  9 (out of 10)",

            "content": "I read the novel 'The 25th Hour' before I even knew it was going to be adapted into a movie and I absolutely loved it. I thought it was one of the best books written in the last ten years. Being a huge fan of Spike Lee and Edward Norton, I was extremely excited when I found they were making it into a film.However I will admit I was a bit skeptical to whether Spike Lee could pull the film off, but when I saw the trailer I had a new found faith in it and I'm sorry to of doubted him. I saw the film yesterday and was just amazed. It's nearly flawless and is almost exactly like the novel which was written by David Benioff (who also wrote the screenplay).The characters in the film are great. You got Monty Brogan (Norton) who's looking at seven years for drug dealing charges. It's his last day of freedom and he's just trying to tie up any loose ends before he goes. Then you got his two friends, Frank Slaughtery (Barry Pepper) and Jakob Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who each have to deal with the fact that their best friend is going away for seven years, but also have their own demons to deal with. You also have his girlfriend, Naturelle Rivera (Rosario Dawson) who must deal with it as well and must also deal with the fact that she's suspect on who could have sold Monty out to the DEA. And finally you have James Brogan (Brian Cox), Monty's father. He's a hard working guy who obviously wished that things didn't turn out the way they did. One last night for Monty to set things straight and also make decisions.The film sticks almost exactly to the novel, but there are slight differences. Since the novel was written in 2000 and the movie was filmed during 2002, Spike Lee and David Benioff included the mentioning of the attacks on New York and the aftermath, which I applaud Lee for. He didn't cop out and try to ignore it like others. It was necessary to capture the emotion of what New Yorkers are facing and among that, what the characters have to face with Monty going to prison. There are also slight differences and cut outs from the book to make the film flow easier, but I was disappointed with only one thing that the film didn't include. In the novel, Monty constantly thinks of how he always wanted to be a fireman. While firemen references and his father was a fireman are all mentioned in the film, it didn't really tackle Monty's regret of never becoming a fireman, like it did in the book. But the film makes up for that one thing by being terrific all around.There are some stellar performances here. Edward Norton is always great in everything he plays, but in this film he is just excellent. The 'F**k You' scene he has when he's staring in the mirror is just excellent and I hope he gets an Oscar nomination for this role (he was robbed from one for American History X). Barry Pepper is in his greatest performance yet as the tough guy stockbroker. Philip Seymour Hoffman was great as Jakob, the high school teacher. Dealing with his attraction to his student, Mary (Anna Paquin). Rosario Dawson really made me feel for her and it was great to see more of her in a film. Brian Cox doesn't have a huge role, but he's great as Monty's father. I would also like to give praise to Tony Siragusa for his performance as Kostya. He was dead on with the accent.So without going on any further, I just have to say that '25th Hour' was really great and is now one of my favorite films of all time.SCORE: 9 out of 10 (excellent)",

            "review_title": "25th Hour, A Film With Sway!",
            "content": "For myself, watching 25th Hour was sort-of like taking a palm reading. Noticing one line, representative of a life-path, stretches out long and far, while another line branches off and stops short in the middle of your palm. You question which life path will you take, and which are you currently on now. Are you one the short one or the long one? You question the various choices and decisions that you made in the past, and which life-line have those choices and decisions ultimately lead you down. In a round-about way, the three characters in Spike Lee's 25th Hour are struggling with these same kind of questions. Based on a novel by David Benioff, the film is essentially three people struggling with the choices that they have made in their past, and the choices they are to make in the future -- and which path will it ultimately lead them down.Edward Norton stars as Monty Brogan, a man whose life decision, becoming a drug dealer, has left him facing a seven year prison term, \"...with 84 days off with good behaviour.\" It's the morning before, and Monty has twenty-five hours left to examine his life, bond with his closest friends, say goodbye to family, find a home for his dog, and figure out a way to survive in the joint. At one point, Monty's friend refers to his incarceration, as \"...going to hell and never coming back,\" and the audience gets the feeling that it's not just a coy metaphor. If Monty does survive his \"time\", he will most assuredly not be the person they once knew when he gets out.Even though he has grown distant from them over the years, Monty chooses to spend his remaining hours with his closest friends from childhood, Jacob Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Frank Slaughtery (Barry Pepper). Socially and economically, these are two of the most dissimilar people one is likely to see spending time together in a film. Their only real connection is the deeply entrenched devotion they feel to their friend. Jacob is a nerdy English teacher, whose gift for the language, has done little for his social skills. His self-doubt and shame for being born wealthy has left him single, lonely and in a thankless job. He desperately yearns for one of his students, a beautiful and precocious seventeen year old, Mary D'Annunzio (Anna Paquin), but is afraid to act on it, fearful that such a decision will lead to him being fired from his job, or even worse, arrested. Frank, on the other hand, is on the opposite end of the character spectrum, he's a good-looking, rich Wall Street trader, who, unlike, his nebbish friend, has never had a problem with the ladies. Also unlike Jacob, Frank is much more forthright in his feelings about life, and his friend's impending incarceration, \"He profited from other's misery and he deserves what he gets,\" he tells Jacob. Norton's character also has a girlfriend, Naturelle, played by Rosario Dawson, whom he believes might have been the one who sold him out to the police. There's also his father, played by Brian Cox, a retired fireman who owns a bar on Staten Island which caters primarily to fire fighters. Each of these people, in their own way, blames them self for what is happening to Monty.The story propels forward when the three childhood friends gather in a nightclub, with Jacob's student, Mary, and Monty's girlfriend, Naturelle, tagging along. It is what happens in this club, on this night, that provides the core of the movie. The accusations that are made, the favor that is asked, the choices that are acted upon, and the truth that is revealed, will stay with these characters long after the 25th hour has widdled and gone away. Will these friends be willing to enact Doyle's Law, in a figurative sense, and save Monty Brogan, the symbolic beaten dog?25th Hour is also memorable for grappling openly with the aftermath of September 11th. Lee skillfully immerses it into the subtext of the story. Referenced in pictures of fire fighters who lost their lives at the World Trade Center, which adorn the walls of the local sports bar and the uptown offices of the traders; to the mention of Bin Laden in a particularly biting commentary by Monty; to Frank Slaughtery's defiant refusal to move from his apartment, which sits overlooking the ruins of the Twin Towers. Director Spike Lee, never known for being subtle, thrusts these images, and his obvious anger about it, into the viewers lap and compels them to deal with it. Also memorable is the venomous diatribe by Norton into a bathroom mirror, where he verbally attacks every group in New York regardless of ethnicity, sexual preference or socioeconomic standing. Not even the church or JC himself, is safe from his tirade, which ends when Monty realizes the only person he has to blame for his predicament, is the one staring back at him in the mirror.The whole film plays in a subdued, almost depressing, tone. There are no laughs to be had, no falsely engineered moments where the characters break bread, and cry, and get all remorseful -- none of that. We feel as Monty feels: perplexed, distressed, unsure of those things to come and angry for how he happened to arrive at this place, and moment, in his life -- his last 25 hours.",

            "content": "STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsSpike Lee is a truly revolutionary director in terms of the presentation of his films and the motivations behind his stories.Though the genre and content of their stories differ fairly enormously,he is in fact a lot like a latter day Alfred Hitchcock in terms of how he presents his films,like the characters involved and the inspiration behind the premise.The premise here is a deeply original,inspiring and intriguing one,concerning Marty (Edward Norton) a drug dealer who is about to go to prison for seven years.The film follows him around on his last day of freedom,and,rather than waste too much time on a hindering,unnecessary sub-plot concerning his attempts to find the person who ratted him out,wisely opts to be an engaging character study of a man who,though able to acknowledge he knew full well what he was doing and the criminal life he was getting himself involved in,is still able to question the possible circumstances and immoralities that may have helped his descent into crime.The two main people who help organise his last free night are his childhood buddies Frank (Barry Pepper) a sleazy stockbroker who plays with people's investments and Jakob (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) a repressed drama teacher,who,throughout the course of the film,gives in to a lustful temptation toward a feisty student of his named Mary (Anna Paquin).Though Marty is the one facing the lengthy jail sentence,the moral dilemma the film constantly raises is whether he is actually any more of a criminal than his two best mates,who are really as equally manipulative and sly as he is.The film brilliantly contrieves to present these characters to the audience,and have them develop their own opinion on what their fates should be.The driving point of the film however,is condemnation.At the beginning,we see Marty reveal his sensitive side to the audience by rescuing a stray dog who appears to have been discarded by it's owner who,though vicious and nasty toward him,he still finds it in his heart to adopt and love,despite the protestations of his large friend.But then the opening credits ensue,and it's a dark,droning opening theme and that prsents the tone of the movie.Then,straight afterwards,we're shown Marty's not-so-sensitive side,as he trys to brush off a man he turned into a drug addict.Lee intelligently and absorbingly weighs out Marty's good points and bad points,and shows that,despite dealing in a criminal profession,he's not all bad and can be quite nice at times.Yet we're also shown a man who wasted all his potential.If he'd tried a little harder,he could've been a doctor or a chef,his father (Brian Cox) points out to him.We also see that he was once a very gifted basketball player,and could possibly have pursued that further,but alas,didn't.He also tries to blame everyone and everything else for his current predicament,until finally accepting that he was in control of his own destiny and must now pay the price.At the end,he is given the choice:accept he did wrong,pay his debt and go and serve his time in jail,or turn and run.The decision he makes will determine the audience's final impression of him.It does drag a little towards the end,but generally speaking,Spike Lee is a master of his craft and this is a strong contender for the first great film of 2003.****",

Which Lee handles with utmost care and outstanding precision.Lee's trademarks are present here and the cinematography suits the feel of the movie very well. The final product feels very polished, but true to the story and it is those small things that some of us notice, those details that separate a veteran from a novice. There are some weak points, but they are only minor.The acting here is top notch. Norton convinces once again and makes for a great heartfelt performance and Hoffman is equally impressive. However, I was completely blown away by Pepper. Barry Pepper. He 'was' continuously Frank and very consistent in his acting. The scene where he breaks down and Norton thanks him in a way for what he has done is one of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen. It felt so authentic.Furthermore, I can keep writing about how great this movie is or how good the acting, but eventually you have to decide for yourself.

I watch figure skating and films because of how they enrich my lives. Sometimes a skater - or an actor for that matter - needs to do something that requires great skill in order to deliver something wonderful. And when they do that, it is a double value.But the world of figure skating - if you have been following it - has gone over to the dark side. Now, skaters will be judged on whether they do something difficult. The more difficult, the higher the score. Grace and coherence of the routine is out the window, considered too subjective to judge.Some people are making films the same way. The recent `Troy' had no grace at all, merely its scope to impress us. In this case - indeed in all Ed Norton films - the justification is purely that we have an actor doing difficult things.There is no grace here, no transportation to insight, no inner world, no coherence. The entire project is there to support Ed and his `difficult moves.'The end is supposed to be a simple take-away: a ten minute future that is yanked back. Much more shocking than this is how muted is our man Spike. His flowing visual talent is usually locked into some stupid sentiments, grace in a dummy suit. Here he is subdued (except for the dollied `sway' segment) and actually tries to make a film. Too bad is vacuous, but this time it isn't his fault.The real actor here is Hoffman, but he is buried in another of his stammering characters.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",

This is the story of a man's last day of freedom before starting a 7-year prison sentence. Funny, how they almost never (if ever) use the words \"prison\" or \"jail\".Edward Norton is great as Monty, and so is the inimitable Philip Seymour Hoffman, who plays one of his best friends. I always enjoy watching both these actors. Hoffman plays a prep-school English teacher who has the hots for one of his students. They run into each other at a nightclub where a big party is thrown for Monty on his last night of freedom. She's not innocent but she is naive. They have an intense moment together at the club.The movie is not really about prison or even what Monty's crime was. It's about all the things Monty has to do to wrap up his life before \"going away\". It's about the things people do to get what they want. It's about the realities of \"going away\" and the difficult emotions of all those involved. There's a brilliant scene where Monty's deepest hate and rage surface, that is very reminiscent of a scene in another great Spike Lee Joint, Do the Right Thing. He basically says F everybody, and then at the end of the scene, F himself. He has nobody else to blame for anything. He alone has ruined his life.This movie made me think about what I would do if I were in his position. How would your parents react if you were going to prison? How would you say bye to your mom or dad? How about your spouse? And your closest friend? What about your dog?It is a thoughtful film that is not about one particular thing. It does not try to get in your face with a single message, but has many messages.",

            "content": "A forceful film, but not necessarily a good one. It is extremely heavy-handed, but the subject matter is never really as dour as it seems to think it is. Basically, the story revolves around a drug dealer (Edward Norton) who is going to be taken to prison 25 hours from when the film opens. This last day is spent reconnecting with his two best friends (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper), his girlfriend (Rosario Dawson), whom he believes turned him in and his father (Brian Cox), as well as cutting ties to the Russian gangsters who were his bosses. All this takes place with the backdrop of September 11th. Oh, does Lee ever try hard to make that metaphor work. This was the first major film that directly referenced the terrorist attacks, and it probably seemed pretty strong for it at the time (over a year later). But, really, any metaphor Lee thinks he's making never really makes too much sense. I've seen people suggest Lee is metaphorically blaming the U.S. for 9/11. I doubt that's true, but it's an easily argued point. I really don't think Lee knows exactly what he wants to say here. The film is so oppressive in its dourness that it gets old pretty fast. The thing is, Norton's going to prison for seven years. That sucks. A lot. But, holy Hell, is this film obsessed with the idea that, the second Norton shows up in prison, it's going to be non-stop gang rape for the next seven years. Of course he's going to have to kick someone's ass the first day he's going to get there. That'll keep his butthole safe for a few hours. Seriously, folks, this stuff is nothing but movie clich\u00e9s. It becomes almost laughable as 25th Hour goes on how obsessed Norton is with getting penetrated. So, really, the film is pretty thin. The heft that Lee shoves into his film never seems deserved. All that said, though, it's not a half bad film. Norton is excellent (though not especially believable as a drug dealer). I didn't like either Pepper or Hoffman - I've always hated the former and the latter just brings his standard sad-sack performance to the mix, which thankfully he's moved beyond by now. Dawson is pretty good, as is Cox. There are a lot of very well directed moments, but I honestly think Lee's done better in this decade, and certainly much better in the previous two.",

His script is fresh, yet somewhat slow in spots. His characters shine, however, in a truly believeable tale of consequence. Edward Norton, in another masterful performance, shows an almost frightening level of genuine human emotion as the protagonist Montgomery Brogan. The supporting cast consisting of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper, and veteran Brian Cox provide a solid foundation  that allows Lee's story to flow freely.  While most would consider this tale a literal one, take note:  It is quite apparent, through subtlety and the rather obvious \"restroom mirror scene\" that Spike Lee has a message he wants to get across.  What I think makes \"25th Hour\" so appealing on a theoretical level is the fact that his message is surprisingly open-ended; allowing the individual viewer to decide what he or she wants to retain from the film.  This is a genuine film experience; a haunting dose of reality.",

The central character is played by Edward Norton, it's revealed early on that he's going to jail. It's all a very thinly veiled metaphor for New York City's loss of innocence after 9/11. Life will go after he gets back from jail or so most of his closest friends think. \"Don't forget where you're from\", blah blah blah.The characters are New York City tough guy clich\u00e9s. The thug played by Norton, the Russian thug who struggles with English. The girlfriend played by Rosario Dawson wasn't very convincing.The only character I really liked was the one played by Phillip Seymor Hoffman and he was underused and pretty much a B-plot character. His relationship with a young student of his had little to do with the plot and nothing to do with Norton.By the end there's a long rambling speech by Norton's on screen father about how he will rise up and come back. It's pretty much all about NYC and what will happen in the months after 9/11. I guess Spike Lee didn't expect an illegal war that would last decades to follow 2 years later.

As an author, I have to say that the film studio that insists on him directing any adaptations of my work will never do business with me again, not even for a short story. His films are tedious, badly paced, and make me seriously reconsider whether I want to live in a world where people this utterly devoid of talent can be successful.It's a sad reflection on the fear of not being politically correct that he is still directing feature films instead of shooting episodes of Cops, which his unimaginative camera use, deadpan direction, and poor editing would be far more appropriate.",

It does, perhaps feel a bit overlong, and there are plenty of aspects of the story that could be cut, but it's a character piece and the performances are really strong.Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) has one last night of freedom before he's due to hand himself in for a seven-year jail term he's received for drug trafficking. He works on getting his affairs in order, whilst going on a night out with his friends Frank (Barry Pepper) and Jacob (Phillip Seymour Hoffman). He has a meal with his father (Brian Cox) and tries to steady his relationship with girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson) who he partially suspects may have had something to do with his arrest.There isn't really a whole lot of plot to \"25th Hour\". There's a whole bunch of subplots, ideas and themes but ultimately, it's a character study. Monty Brogan isn't particularly likable, despite his decision to save a dog in an early scene. He's a drug dealer, as we know, with links to the Russian mob. When he first meets her, his girlfriend Naturelle is frankly worryingly young - still at school even. Throughout the film he's re-evaluating his life and wondering if he's made the wrong decisions. His friends have their own problems, but neither of them are facing jail the next night.The film is another of Lee's love letters to New York, this one though was his first after 9/11 and you can feel the anger, defiance and pain in the film - particularly in the films most memorable scene - in which Brogan launches into a foul mouthed tirade about the various nationalities and ethnic groups of the city, before turning it around on himself.I am the sort of person that's attracted to stories above all, so in that regard I wouldn't describe \"25th hour\" as being one of my favourite films - but you can't argue with the quality of the performances.",

It would seen that some people feel that by tweaking a few of the initial conditions in stories in this genre an original and creative movie will pop out. Not so, at least in this case, with the tweak being that we follow Monty in the 24 hours prior to his reporting to prison.As Monty, Edward Norton turns in a performance that is what you would expect from him in this role. The talents of Philip Seymour Hoffman are wasted as Monty's nerdy English teacher friend. The only actor whose performance goes beyond the adequate is Brian Cox as Monty's father.There are one or two interesting scenes, but that is not enough to carry the movie. The scene where Monty is talking to himself in the mirror where he vents his spleen against every sexual, racial, and class stereotype, winding up with himself, is interesting and the fantasy that his dad spins about an escape at the end is well done. I did like that the assurance \"we will be there for you when you get out,\" offered by Monty's friends was offset by the recognition by all concerned that Monty would not be the same person when he got out that he was before going in.A lot of efforts were made to add some gravitas to the happenings, but they seemed forced to me. The cleanup of the Twin Towers site is used as the backdrop for some scenes, with bulldozers plying the ground and the vertical blue searchlights piercing the night sky. Such scenes provoke strong emotions for most Americans, particularly for those who lived through that time. But what was the purpose for having those scenes in this movie besides exploitation? Evoking such tragedy in a story that is no tragedy seems cheap. Scenes filmed using unusual color palettes, odd camera angles, or double takes were more distracting than illuminating. The thing that I found most irritating was the score--most of the time it worked at cross purposes to the mood, calling attention to it rather than the action on screen. The score tries to produce a heavy mood that simply is not there in the story.Many scenes, like the ones in the nightclub, go on too long--those scenes accumulate to the entire movie's going on too long.",

It doesn't really work, and the sad thing is that there are plenty of opportunities to develop a really good story here.Spike Lee must take the brunt of the criticism - the direction is less than subtle and is an obvious attempt to distract from the plot's shortcomings. Yet another example of style over substance in Hollywood.  This film - and Lee's direction - is so far up it's own arse at some points it is cringeworthy to watch.  You can imagine the stage direction in some of the scenes, \"Okay Ed, really go for it here - after we add the music this'll be your Oscar scene...\"Not awful by any means, but the fact is without the names of Norton and Lee attached, this film would have past unnoticed.5/10",

I didn't leave though, as I wanted to fill in my comment card!I'll start with the good points: the acting was excellent for the most part. That's about all the pluses, actually.  The story was, to say the least, confused.  I have no idea how for example, apparently in the same day, someone can get raided by the DEA, have an interview in which he indicates the approach he'll take with the judge, and then (apparently without actually having a trial) get ready to go to jail.It is slowly paced for no apparent reason other than self-indulgence and is confusingly shot and edited.  For example, fractions of a second of \"action\" are sometimes repeated immediately after they happen - don't ask me why - it's not clever or cool, that's for sure.  And there are some glaring (and I can only hope) intentional continuity errors when quickly changing camera angle.  It also has a sometimes distracting soundtrack, like in the club where the scratching keeps swapping from left side to right but has little bearing to the rest of the music.One of the biggest surprises for me reading other reviews was how much people liked the I-hate-everybody-or-maybe-it's-just-my-fault bathroom mirror scene, which was appallingly out-of-place both in style and in (or out of!) character, then was immediately self-dismissive at the end of the scene.  Well spoken \"monologue\", yes, but served no purpose at all.The only three adjectives I could honestly tick on the preview comments card were violent, slow, and disappointing.  4/10 (and that's mostly for the acting).

The film opens with extensive shots of the memorial lights where the towers were, and the camera is constantly picking up memorials and tributes behind conversations, including one scene in a firefighters' bar and another in an apartment window overlooking Ground Zero, to flags on SUV antennas to a closing in memoriam and use of Bruce Springsteen's \"The Force\" over the credits (Spike thanks him as \"Da Boss\").  Like Bruce does in \"The Rising,\" Terence Blanchard incorporates Arabic singing in an evocative score.  The score becomes as much about the new visibly multi-ethnic New York City as Gershwin stood for Woody Allen's \"Manhattan.\" Spike Lee is still a bit heavy-handed in dealing with white ethnic groups -- here stereotypes of Russian gangsters and Irish drunks almost replace his Italian ones from the ham-fisted \"Summer of Sam.\"But in the extensive, theatrical, illustrated monologues the characters rage on about the changes in New York City and escaping it, he gives them the post-9/11 gift of final understanding, even as each \"stays a New Yorker.\"\nThrough one character, we also see the white collar parallel to the streets, the aggressive, upwardly striving atmosphere of trading rooms, similarly shown in \"Boiler Room,\" tempered by the knowledge that so many of those who died in the towers worked just like that. The acting by Ed Norton, Rosario Dawson, Barry Pepper, Brian Cox and Philip Seymour Hoffman is very strong, in what is in effect a New York take on \"Dead Man Walking\" as all gradually come to terms with a crime and its impact on their lives.Weakest is the central meeting point as some private school they are all connected to and gravitate around as the locus of their \"Glory Days\" as Lee seems to be saluting Woody Allen in another way by adding in what now seems to be the obligatory jailbait in short skirts temptation.",

I have absolutely no idea.I could go on and on about the gratuitous shots of the World Trade Center, the lack of any exploration of the relationship with his girlfriend, but why bother.

Three grown-up childhood friends from Brooklyn--a schlub teacher, a financier, and a drug-dealer recently put out of commission--go clubbing on the dealer's last night of freedom before facing a seven-year jail-term. Blobby scenes of the dealer with his father, the teacher with a frisky student, and the underworld crime scene feel culled from another era, not helped by Benioff's late-night TV dialogue. Lee has designed the picture in a distinctly modern way, and it looks great, but he's too much the reverential student here. Handling his actors unevenly, Lee's film also feels unbalanced: Anna Paquin overplays mercilessly, yet her subplot with Philip Seymour Hoffman goes absolutely nowhere. The overtures to 9/11 are heartfelt--if misplaced--and Edward Norton's work is almost strong enough to hold the flimsy scenario together. Every time Norton is off-screen, however, the film loses its impetus. ** from ****",

We found ourselves warming up to Monty for his love for his girlfriend, his father, and his dog. And we applauded Frank for his convictions towards his life-long friend, Monty. Rosario Dawson played a very sexy and convincing girlfriend who stood by her convicted lover. The scenes of New York and the references to the World Trade Center destruction were provided by the experienced eyes and mind of Spike Lee. They added realism and intensity to the story.

            "content": "During the opening credits of \"25th Hour\", the tall beams of light that emanate from the site in New York City where the World Trade Center once stood, provide the drama that follows with a strong sense of time and place and a very recognisable subtext. Its story about a small group of people who, after an unexpected event, are left feeling shell-shocked and fearing that things may never be the same again, is filled with moments of sadness, regret and anger as well as an overwhelming sense of loss.Convicted drug dealer Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) spends his last 24 hours of freedom dealing with his unfinished business and meeting up with his father and friends one last time before he begins a seven year prison sentence. During this period he thinks about the raid on his apartment during which three DEA agents found large quantities of drugs and money hidden in his sofa and strongly suspects that his Puerto Rican girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson) was responsible for tipping off the authorities. He's also very frightened about serving time in what he knows is a very tough and overcrowded institution and genuinely fears that he won't be able to survive the experience.Monty's father James (Brian Cox), is a bar owner and a retired fire-fighter who became an alcoholic after his wife's death. He was threatened with losing his business because of the debts that he incurred because of his drinking and it was only the money that Monty was able to give him that saved him from going under. He knows how the money that saved his business was earned and is burdened with a great deal of shame, guilt and regret about what happened.After Monty and his father finish their meal together, Monty meets up with his two best friends, high school teacher Jacob (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Wall Street broker Frank (Barry Pepper) at a nightclub and they're also joined by one of Jacob's students called Mary (Anna Paquin) and Naturelle. On this last night that the friends spend together, they all try to keep things as affable and normal as possible but the underlying tensions and anxieties that they all share inevitably surface from time to time.Jacob and Frank are facing the loss of a friendship that they have shared with Monty since they were children and although Jacob likes to think that everything can carry on again as normal in seven years time, Frank is far more sceptical. Naturelle is losing the man she loves and on their last day together has had to cope with the tensions caused by the suspicions that Monty and his friends share about her. Monty's father is also fearful about whether it will be possible for him and his son to resume their relationship after another seven years have elapsed.In one of the most memorable parts of the movie, Monty looks at his reflection in a mirror and launches into an angry rant during which he expresses his hatred of Osama Bin Laden and almost every sector of the population of New York but as this cathartic endeavour comes to a close, his greatest anger is reserved for himself. He hates his own stupidity that led him to hide the drugs and money in his apartment and also to tell other people where he kept them. He also hates himself for the greed that led him to continue in the drug dealing business for as long as he did.\"25th Hour\" is a powerful and thoughtful piece that like Terence Blanchard's marvellous score has a really haunting quality. Edward Norton is tremendous as the villain who never expresses any regret for all the human misery his drug dealing must've caused and Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper are also outstanding.",

            "content": "Monty Brogan comes across an injured dog in the opening scene. First he wants to put it out of its misery, but upon its fierce growls, he resolves to nurse Doyle back to health. Fast forward to his last 24 hours of freedom, and Doyle is there. This is a starkly depressing portrait of New York City painted by Spike Lee. The opening credits feature twin spotlights in place of the World Trade Towers, and the great city is dark, muted, grieving in the wake of 9/11. Prieto opens with a grainy look. Jacob and Frank talk over the ashes of Ground Zero and the tragedy that shoot America, but he would never sell such a prestigious spot in the skyline. The muted palette is punctuated by a few instances of vivid colour. The most memorable is the monologue in the bathroom, where Norton's passionate and bitter voice-over serenades a highly saturated daydream of New York and its various inhabitants and creatures. The sky is literally pure white, such is the intensity of the colour grading. It's a great contrast to the sheer hostility in Monty's rant. The outrageous flood of emotions in the wake of his mistake and the city, in all its glory and gore signify not only how he wishes he had quit earlier, but the harsh reality that this is all his own doing as his mirror self unleashes. The first two stages of grief are denial and anger; Norton fully showcases both here.His two best friends mirror his dilemma in their own lives. Frank is a cocky wall street broker, who like Monty, has indulged in a lavish lifestyle by profiting on the misery of others. He is so sure that Monty's life is over as he repeatedly tells Jacob; but then later in the silence of the club, he makes a heartfelt promise to be there after 7 years. They leave on heartbreaking terms; the 'fight' scene is visceral like no other, so much more emotional punch (both literally and figuratively) and conflict because we know how much Frank loves Monty and yet how angry those blows feel - how long has he wanted to beat some sense into his best friend? Jacob's issue is his attraction to one of his students, but Benioff's twist is that both seem to understand why they cannot go any further. Two of Lee's trademark double dolly shots appear here. One, of Paquin in her ecstasy driven state of pure euphoria, slowed down to magnify the drug's effects. The second, right after that momentary kiss; Jacob stares at the camera in confusion and distress as he glides along, the club raging on without him. There is a sobering effect as he realises what he has done; one little whisper like Kostya and his comfortable life will crumble. Both Hoffman and Pepper excel at these supporting roles, and credit must also be given to Benioff for creating such an engaging trio who seem to be utterly and distinctly different from each other. How many movies would group together a pompous wall streeter, a modest English teacher and a drug dealer together? But they display such depth, and so we fully believe that Frank will not break his promise, but also feel the shocking need for each blow which distorts Monty's face. Dawson as Naturelle is seductive, and yet disproportionately shallow. Their little youthful encounter (Ebert would call it a meet cute) by the swings does not hold the same unspoken bond that Monty has with Jacob and Frank. This is a messy movie. Car trunks are slammed shut, and then again. We jump cut in the middle of dialogue subtly, and the 180 degree rule is violated when the trio fight under the bridge. On the other hand, we have that final segment where Monty's father envisages an alternative escape for his son. It has a certain sentimental charm to it, and almost verges on clich\u00e9; Monty and Naturelle reunite and come together three times in succession, and grow old and tell their story (Blanchard's score is its most stirring here). But Cox makes it heart-wrenchingly evocative in his monologue; he talks of an idyllic future that Monty will never experience, and he is powerless to change this. An old saying states that no parents should ever have to bury their children. Here, no child should have to support their father's bar with drug money, and we feel James' guilt in his every word, and it is tragic.",

Synopsis: Awaiting execution of his seven year prison sentence, Drug Lord Monty Brogan reevaluates his entire life. Taps for A drug DealerThe last day of freedom for Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) before a seven-year drug dealing term starts on the promenade overlooking the East River as Monty ponders his life. Born into an Irish family with an alcoholic father (Brian Cox) and an angelic mother, Brogan though short won a prep school scholarship for basketball. On his sad walkabout Brogan revisits the school with his dog Doyle. Doyle is no ordinary dog. Brogan on the way to a drug deal found the battered Doyle by the side of the road and brought the battered animal to a Vet. At the school Brogan learns his youthful laurels have been surpassed by later students and his records broken. Regretfully though a star player, Brogan had been cut from the team before graduation. Brogan had discovered it more profitable to sell drugs to rich kids at the school rather than play basketball. There is a certain charm to Monty Brogan despite his chosen career in drugs. Yet it is difficult to feel even a little sympathy for a man who has exchanged dreams of court-side seats at Madison Square Garden for the dock in a different forum or even to despise whoever might have turned the wretch in. In the hours before execution of sentence, Brogan must question who betrayed him: his girlfriend Naturalle is as likely prospect as his business associate Kostya. In a disturbing looks at himself in the mirror, Brogan is quite frank in his hates: The Catholic Church, The clannish Italians, The Irish firemen, the patrons of his father's bar all killed at the World Trade Center, The Diamond Merchants, Blacks who in his opinion can't really play basketball and immigrants of all types. Did Brogan leave anyone out? Edward Norton plays Brogan the centerpiece of the drama with consummate persuasion. Yet at 6'1\" he is hardly the scrawny Irish kid who leaped onto the basketball court with a fury. Nor is Norton, the son of a polished Baltimore barrister, from a dysfunctional home in the nether world of the borderline between poverty and respectability. Yet Norton carries Brogan so well that the Brogan character melds into the film's remarkable, excellent, realistic local color from New York. As Brogan rants how much he hates his father, the viewer flows in a flashback right into Brogan's father's tavern with off-duty city firemen cheering the NY Yankees on and is flashed ahead to the wreaths laid in their memory against a wall. Brogan's drug money kept the bar afloat. How Brogan wishes he had invested the loot with a high school friend who became a successful trader on Wall Street. Although the screen play is ambitious and daring in trying to make a sympathetic character out of slick drug dealer in final days before imprisonment, the well-drawn characters plod through wholly believable situations in Spike Lee's terrifying, raw look at society and penetrating study of Irish Americans. On his last fling, Brogan takes his high school chums for a visit to one of those Manhattan clubs where the drug world, the haute monde and the mob intersect, certainly the type of den of inequity which could produce the traitor. Surrendering faithful Doyle to one of his friends, Brogan demands a beating from the other so that he'll look tough enough for prison. His father arrives to drive Brogan to Otisville, but privately offers to send him into hiding. Brogan vividly imagines the type of life he could lead on the lam or does Brogan imagine going to jail? Lee captures in a fleeting seconds at the end what few outsiders understand about the duality of the minds of the Kelts and the power of the dream world and the imagination",

When the DEA are tipped off they find several kilos of cocaine in his sofa and he is sentenced to 7 years under strict new NYC laws.  With his last day before jail upon him, Monty meets with his father, friends and business partners for one last time, meanwhile he tries to figure out who it was that gave him away to the DEA.The plot summary is not enough to tell you about this film \u0096 it is more of a frame for a wider plot.  The actual story here is one of regret and all the emotions that come with it.  There are other subplots thrown in but it is about regret. Monty has been caught, his regret is that he should have stopped long ago when he had plenty of cash but he didn't.  His friends also pity his fate but did nothing to ever try and stop him dealing.  He blames other at first but then settles into his fate.From the opening credit sequence we are left in no doubt about the parallels that we are clearly meant to be making.  The clich\u00e9d focus on the New York skyline is replaced with a focus on a battered skyline which has two beams of light replacing the two towers.  Add to this the references to firemen who died in it and of course the fact that Slaughtery's flat overlooks ground zero itself and it is hard to get away from.  So now we have a film that is about America and it's regret now that it's chickens have come home to roost.  Opening with an act of kindness (an American helps an injured party while a Russian doesn't care!) the film continues with this dual story.  There is never a doubt that the characters who stood by and benefited from Monty's crimes are none other than other countries who failed to put America right on it's foreign policy.  This is never more forcefully made than in Monty's `f**k you' speech, where he points fingers all over NYC before eventually deciding that he is responsible for his own crimes.If the main story was merely a prop for this subtext (if I can call it sub!) then this would be a poorer film, however it holds it own.  Even if every part of this went over your head the central story is involving enough to hold the attention.  At times it is a little laboured or scenes feel extended beyond their reach but overall it works well.  The teacher/student subplot just didn't work and it is the one part where Lee tips over into `style over substance'.  When Jacob walks away from the bathroom in the club with the camera fixed to him I couldn't help feel that I really had no involvement or interest in this thread.  However for the rest of the film Lee's style is complimented by substance and moments such as this are rare. The other main weakness for me was the ending (don't worry \u0096 it's not a spoiler).  The ending fantasy sequence is too long.  It makes a good point in terms of the subtext (that America should make amends and start over but also be honest about where it has come from), but it labours this point by dragging it out where it should have been punchier.One of the main reasons I was held by the film was great performances all round.  Norton is easily one of the best actors of our generation.  I hope he continues to make good performances in (sort of) risky film choices.  He clearly knows the significance of his character but it isn't laboured \u0096 and the fact that he manages to pull off the `f**k you' scene (which could have been an embarrassing failure) is proof of his ability.  The support cast are all very strong with only one major exception.  Hoffman was a surprise to me in that he didn't manage to make his character involving.  Now in one respect that is the fault of his weak subplot, but it was still a surprise. More surprising was a real good performance by Pepper.  I have seen him in smaller roles in Private Ryan, Enemy of the State, Green Mile so this showed a lot more of him to me.  My biggest joy in the cast was that Rosario Dawson was used well.  I think because she is beautiful and Puerto Rican that filmmakers think `exotic love-interest' and nothing more.  Seeing her in this and Kids just makes it worse when she is wasted in stuff like MIIB, Adventures of Pluto Nash and Down to You.  However here is a good character and delivers strong performance.  Cox is good support and the atypical Russian mob clich\u00e9s are mercifully underused.Without the subtext this film is weaker. But with it, it is as good a film as Lee has made in the past 5 or so years.  It has flaws in the telling, and I'm sure many will hate it for preaching a message or neglecting the main plot for the subtext (in their opinion) but I thoroughly enjoyed it despite the odd flaw.  I'd like to thank Lee and Benioff for doing something that I'm not allowed to do more often in the cinema \u0096 think.",

Such is the brilliance of 25th Hour; an overflowing well of authentic ensemble acting, keenly disillusive dialog, and subtle though masterful direction all over the plate of a tightly wound scenario that finds lead Norton saying goodbye to life as he knows it on his last day as a free man in New York. Working from this instantly appealing framework, Lee films David Benioff's novel with an eerie grace, displaying a haunting, lingering quality present in the majority of the realistically executed scenes that gives the emotional integrity found throughout a thriving re-playability that transcends even the outstanding performances themselves. And characterizations do indeed manifest themselves as the most resonant aspect of this whole success story. There is an absolute synergy between this excellent cast, helping to color in the already vibrant material to completely believable lengths. There's not a single flaw in the casting of this movies six principal roles, proved by the effortless flow this group exhibits acting together in various scenes which actually convinces moviegoers of all the past these people had together- no small task and especially important given this theme. Despite the overindulgence of subplot, everyone is in such convincing form that it all adds up to a worthwhile sextuplet of narratives with Norton's central glue giving everything shape. As uniformly solid everyone was, I was most surprised (and engaged) by Barry Pepper's near scene-stealing attempts in an electrified and noteworthy performance that will likely eclipse everything else I'll seen him in. An eclectic score helps punctuate this film's more personal rhythms in very satisfying and intimate ways, though there are a few moments where slightly overbearing and pretentious compositions help aid the movies confused (in retrospect) post 9/11 subtext. Not to be missed, 25th hour also includes one of the decades most blistering mainstream cinematic monologues, even if it is taking queue from Lee's earlier work.",

Is that the actors in the main tryst do not falter one bit.Firstly, Spike Lee directs this piece seemingly free of the emotional anger that has driven many of his finest pictures, and the result is a somewhat beautiful ode to the post 9/11 New York City that he obviously loves. The story that unfolds is a cracker in itself, but it's actually the framing of this story in New York that is the film's main draw card. There are some gorgeous shots in this film, one as the camera zooms between two of our main protagonists talking in a high rise; which reveals a sombre and hopeful shot of ground zero. Secondly there's a sequence under an archway, which as the violence explodes it becomes crucial to the film, and then Lee fades out the sound to just reveal that of birds twittering away as if peace was being found.Edward Norton is one of the finest actors working today, and here he doesn't disappoint as the lead man trying to tie up all the loose ends of his life before he goes to prison for 7 years. Witness a scene as he rants in a mirror with poignant and impacting dialogue. There are {In my humble opinion of course} very few actors in history who could make this scene work to the degree of impact that Norton achieves. Philip Seymour Hoffman has a very sedate role and it's these type of roles where I think he excels, so much emotion whilst actually not doing much is an incredible feat, and Hoffman is just perfect in this piece. Whilst the best thing I can say about Barry Pepper is that he isn't out of place alongside these two {often considered} modern greats, he well holds his own, and in some scenes he mesmerises as he holds the court.The lead girl in the film does not fare so well, tho, Rosario Dawson is a sexy vision of delight in a tight fitting silver dress, but as the main female lead she falters in the company she is in. Perhaps that is a touch harsh? But although she doesn't stink the film out, I can't help feeling that a stronger female lead could of competed with the boys and really drove home some of the more critical scenes. Anna Paquin says her lines right and does enough to leave a mark, whilst Brian Cox, fine actor that he is, looks like he is just glad to be in a Spike Lee film. And by that I mean he gives his usual solid show with a tint of smugness about him. Bless him, he's still the governor.Personally it's a film that I find stays with me for a couple of days and one which I without hesitation want to see again and again over the coming years. With fine acting and directing, and pulsing a human emotive heartbeat for viewer and director alike, 25th Hour is a first rate success. 9/10",

The drag becomes a little too heavy after an hour into the film, despite the strong performances of Norton and Co. The movie could have ended on several occasions, yet it persists in slowly pushing forward and resulting in a rather unsatisfactory ending, an ending which the efforts put in by the actors do not deserve. As mentioned, the cast is outstanding, with Barry Pepper being my actor of the movie. He outshines everyone with his unabashed attitude and utterly convincing portrayal of one good friend being afraid to show his true loyalty in a society that often cynically rewards good with evil.",

It appears he's done it again with \"25th Hour\". I'm always on my guard going into one of his pictures because I'm expecting an agenda. The scene that started to bother me a lot before it was over was Monty's (Edward Norton) bathroom mirror soliloquy, a Spike Lee rant that leaves political correctness in the dust and skewers virtually every ethnic identity there is. But when it was over, Monty comes to an undeniable conclusion - he 'f....d' up all on his own. I felt better when that came out, the concept of personal responsibility seems to be retreating further and further behind in an era obsessed with getting and having it all. So for Lee to call attention to it isn't a bad thing to my mind. He seems to be kicking slackers, malcontents, and common street thugs in the butt with a wisdom that takes some folks many years to come to grips with. Yes, the film deals with it's share of desperation and futility, and a nod to the spirit of a city devastated by the events of 9/11. However the imagery of removing the rubble from our own lives is a powerful one, and Lee seems to be a master at that. Once again, Edward Norton turns in a stellar performance. Of the crop of modern (not so young anymore) actors, he's right up there at the top of the heap. He gets strong support here from Pepper, Dawson, Paquin and Cox, and a truly conflicted performance from Philip Seymour Hoffman.",

During this time, he reflects on what caused him to get \"pinched\", and how he is throwing his life away. And most importantly, about his life that was so close to happening.A very interesting concept overall. Movies either focus on what gets people into jail, what they do when they get there and how they survive, but I've rarely seen films that focus on the moments before going to prison. The family and friends that are left behind. The regrets, the confusion. It's certainly an original concept that was well executed. Beautiful character development and cinematography (especially near the end during the long driving scene). The story is told mainly in chronological order, however there are some flashbacks cut in here and there - however it's not too difficult to tell that they are in fact flashbacks.My only quip with this film that would have bumped it up to a 9 rating otherwise was some of the unnecessary deviations away from Monty (the main character)'s story. Example; the side-plot that explores Jacob Lewinsky (Monty's best friend and lonely prep school teacher)'s lust for his 17 year old student. Completely unnecessary and didn't enrich the movie in any way. Those scenes with Jacob in the club with the girl were awkward and just stuck out from the rest of the movie, which was otherwise beautifully done. I didn't see the point of it, and was a little confused as to why it was there in the first place.Overall - interesting, original concept. Definitely powerful and provocative, but could go an extra mile or two without subplot deviations.",

Riddled with clich\u00e9s, Hollywood stereotypes (Endless American flags and shots of firemen, all Eastern Europeans talk and act like how you'd expect them to be in Hollywood, there's no difference between being Russian and Ukrainian, East Indians can't be anything else other than cabbies, Irish people all drink and want to own bars, all stock brokers are stealing your money), an awfully lame dream sequence where \"Old\" Norton's make-up was a joke, and \"Grandma\" Dawnson's makeup was virtually nonexistent. The casting for their grown up children don't even reflect the right mixture of races.Far too many predictable boring subplots, all shot from your usual Spike Lee camera angles. Spike: \"Oh! Look at me! I'll create an interesting color palette by putting everyone in a nightclub so people will forget they're watching another pointless scene\".Now there's nothing wrong with trying hard to make a good film but when the story is weak, you can't make it any better by covering it up with a non-related backdrop. Putting two actors in a room where it overlooks the remains of the World Trade Center does not make their pseudo-philosophical yet very pointless dialog anywhere close to being interesting or actually philosophical; it's just a sign of trying too hard to put an importance on some mindless rambling. Looks nice, but that's about it.Spike, in the past, has done a good job at taking jabs at racial issues. Issues that has to do with a film's certain era. Here however, he throws in 5 minutes worth of racial slurring, even though it's unrelated to the film's eternity, for the sake of being dramatic. It's almost as if he's venting out his own prejudices on the big screen, then tells us \"Hey I'm only joking!\" by having Norton correct his own thoughts. All the hate added nothing to the already wafer thin film, it only sunk it down another notch.I think Spike must have had some bad run in's with people of other colors, especially the Koreans. In all his films he displays them as the \"no-speaky-English\" type who all own corner grocery stores. What did any of that have to do with Norton's last day before prison? Older man is attracted to a teenager, some guy who is \"evil\" because he wears a suit to work and makes more money than your average joe, European immigrants are nothing but two dimensional criminals, cops are bad. Endless clich\u00e9s, perhaps all this would have worked if the film was made 15 years ago but for something that's from 2003, I expected a lot more from Spike.I could go on and on but one thing that really bother me why are they everyone all so overly dramatic about Norton going to prison? 7 years is a long time but it's definitely not a life-time. Prison is tough but the way they played it up, it felt like Norton was going to be executed.This film was Luke-warm at best. And that's on a very good day, where one is positive and generous with any movie. Overall 25th Hour does not amount to much, its runtime could have been perfectly compressed into a mere 25 minutes. There was no reason for it to be made, all the actors in this should be a little bit shameful to have pick up such easy paychecks. I'm voting it down to a 1/10 only because it's rated much higher than it deserved to be, which is no more than a 4/10. Each Seinfeld episode weighted in for about 22 minutes, but at least a good chunk of them were quite enjoyable to watch.",

            "content": "As 'A Spike Lee Joint,' 25th hour is a paradigm, filled with Lee's typical style and directorial vigor. A flowing, feature length music video, containing a story that is coherent, topical and, above all, strongly analytical in its approach to the characters, 25th Hour is the story of mid level drug dealer (Monty Brogan \u0096 Ed Norton) whom, on his last day before being incarcerated for his elicit trade, must make peace with his family and friends, answer to his Red Mafia suppliers, say farewell to the city he so obviously loves and, ultimately, accept that he is now in receipt of justified dues. With a post 9/11 setting in NYC, the script deviates from the book (which was written pre-9/11) only slightly in order to encompass the destruction, yet the atmosphere is set with the opening credits and a slice of dialogue during the first quarter (followed by some beautifully filmed cutaways to a sodium lit nighttime clean-up crew, working in Ground Zero) which leaves the audience with no alternative but to associate the main characters' desperate tableau with plight of the city in the aftermath of tragedy. This could perhaps beg the question: What was so bad about how Monty made his living to warrant the end of his life (in effect) in the 25th Hour?This is a question answered before it's asked, with the first scene after the opening credits showing an exchange between Monty and a disheveled wreck of a man who is quite clearly one of his customers. It's further reinforced in a later flashback to Monty's earlier days as a dealer when the same man approaches Monty dressed in business attire. The destruction of others for personal gain is something that will not - and quite rightly so - go unchallenged. A subplot concerns blame, where Monty vilifies and accuses everyone in the city, himself included. However, later in the film, the injustice of this is rectified with a simple shot of the various people, looking upon him with sympathy \u0096 the personification of this being a small boy offering a sign of friendship. Monty's own redemption begins and is represented by him expressing his brotherhood to the child in return. Relying somewhat on symbolism and hidden meanings, there are a number of subtexts, as well as ample opportunities to read into the narrative more than is intended, but the overall message is clear: culpability is in the hands of the bearer, and with his last 24 hours of freedom sifting away and the eponymous 25th Hour quickly approaching Monty must see that blame can only lie with himself. 25th Hour's greatest achievement is in relaying a subtle, but highly relevant parable in a manner of storytelling that is both enjoyable and compelling. Very few words are wasted and the dialogue remains taught and muscular throughout. The editing, acting, score, direction and cinematography are all of the very highest standard. It could've been very easy for a film of this nature to fail by being presented as an embarrassing lecture. Thankfully 25th Hour is definitely no lecture, but a powerful and haunting movie.",

But, it had some aspects that I thought would make a GREAT short, independent movie.  And it served to give me inspiration to think in new directions.   Basically, this should have been a short indy, and it would of course go on to win at Sundance or Caan.  But it needed to be 20 minutes long, not stretched in to 2.5 hours.  I could see the parallel he was trying to draw with the three characters.   Basically, its about how we all have things we want in life that are not attainable without breaking the rules or the law.  Ed Norton's character sells drugs to live a good lifestyle, gets caught, and is in the process of dealing with the consequences.   Barry Pepper's character takes risky manuevers at work against his boss's approval, but doesn't get caught and he is rewarded. Phillip Seymor Hoffman wants to have sex with his siren student, Anna Paquin.  He fights temptation, but finally gives in a little and kisses her. His fate is left in the balance.  The best part of the movie is when Ed Norton gives his big monologue, when he has a conversation with himself in the mirror and voices his rage against the world.  I liked that part the best, everything else was pretty boring and self indulgent. \nNotable points to this film:  Anna Paquin!  She is HOT!  I first noticed her in THE X MEN.  She is a goddess, to be sure.  In fact, the only reason I went to view this \"Spike Lee Joint\" was to see her.  Otherwise, I would not bother with a \"Spike Lee Joint.\"  I just would not waste my time.Another notable point:  The father's overlong monologue about the life that Norton could have had.  That just went on and on and on! Enough!That is what hurt this movie.  There were a lot of parts that just didn't really add anything important to the movie.  I understand that the father's monologue served to drive home the tragedy that Norton faced, going to prison.  But it was WAY too long!The sub plot with Norton's girlfriend was un-needed.

            "content": "Whenever the author of a book also writes the screenplay that is then shot and turned into the film, I suppose there will always be the threat of them including a little too much as they adapt their own subject matter and story. Such is the case with 25th Hour; a film that rolls along with scene after scene of dialogue, character relationships, atmosphere (however limp at times), exchanges and other such things that might occur and all clocking in at around about two hours fifteen minutes. Maybe writer David Benioff could've made it a little shorter but I guess he wants us to absorb as bigger picture as possible.Whatever film of Edward Norton's (old or new) I come across, he always impresses me and he does the best with the material he's given here. His character does not go through any changes and as a drug dealer from the start with a fancy apartment and pretty wife, there is not much we can have for him in terms of empathy. Norton plays Montgomery Brogan, a guy who one day just gets careless as the film's initial incident would show us: someone's been telling the DEA what Montgomery keeps in his sofa seats as padding. And so, this launches a very slow and very precise film adopting a style that is somewhat reminiscent of a fly-on-the-wall approach to film presentation. We don't just see Monty and his friends in a nightclub dancing or getting drunk or whatever else other films would focus on, we actually have them queuing up outside; getting let in the door; finding a seat; sitting down; having them measure how much they drink; have them leave for the toilet and have them talk to one another about issues that do not mean much to the narrative.But then again, this is an interesting idea. Spike Lee's films are all about relationships, no matter how obscure or taboo to the respective backgrounds in which the characters live (see Jungle Fever, in my opinion his best film so far). I think it's rather a bit symbolic that the most interesting story going on in this film is the parallel narrative involving Jacob Elinsky (Hoffman), a lecturer, and Mary D'Annunzio (Paquin), a much younger student at his place of teaching. This is not surprising as it revolves around a relationship of some sort; a teacher/student relationship and one that threatens to escalate into a loving one. We first see Mary when she's in his class; her red attire draws our eyes immediately and her status as the one we should be focusing on is confirmed when Montgomery himself says so to Jacob upon visiting his class. But then Lee doesn't shoot her as an object of desire and cleverly has her as a smart and independent female \u0096 best demonstrated when she goes to Jacob's office to complain about grades and the quality of fellow students.So with this multi-stranded film focusing on Montgomery and his last night of freedom before he goes off to prison, how disappointing and yet interesting to have a secondary story actually better than the primary. The film also dips into Frank Slaughtery's (Pepper) egotistically driven life and world early on but it is scrapped after a while; perhaps mercifully since the film would've been longer. But that's not to say Frank plays an important role; well, he does precipitate in perhaps the film's best scene nearer the end when he has to do 'one last favour' for Norton's character but apart from that, he is a name and a face merely there to be spoken to. The film also has Kostya Novotny (Siragusa) dip in and out of the main strand since he is Monty's Russian friend. The scenes with Kostya are a breath of fresh air in an otherwise serious and depressing film and his scenes are either funny or dramatic; the one in the nightclub being the one that stands out.But apart from being a little Hannibal Lecter series reunion between Cox (Norton's father), Norton and Hoffman, there isn't much to be had out of 25th Hour. The film's subject matter is one that could be the final hours before a prisoner's execution or the last 'date' you'll spend with an ex-partner before they are married; it's just that Montgomery's story and situation do not make for pleasant viewing \u0096 nor does the approach at times. There are many exterior shots of the city at night which look beautiful but this is just hiding all the ugliness that is on the inside of the city, the ugliness that Montgomery dedicates a little monologue toward but it's all interesting and rather juxtaposed film-making. I do not think 25th Hour is a bad film but perhaps it is a misdirected one. I think the final act is where a lot of people have been fooled but I was less impressed. I'm sure the DEA's handling of prisoner transport in real life is a little more thorough than portrayed here and if Monty hated New York so much any way, I wonder why he didn't follow through on his ideas sooner rather than wait until when he does in the film. Waiting indeed, until the 25th Hour.",

The fine actors in this film do not speak as characters, with unique personalities and convictions, but function only as factotums for Lee's pompous social posturing and half-baked intellectual conceits. Or they are simply wasted. In one scene, Philip Seymour Hoffman, one of the most expressive character actors to come along in recent memory, spends an entire scene talking into a window with his face away from the camera. The editing looks like it was done by a college film class in someone's garage. After garbling a compelling story with his overbearing pontificating, Lee frantically wraps it up with that most trite confession of the mediocre filmmaker: a voice over. And what a long, droning one it is. Poor Brian Cox tries valiantly to lend some nobility to Lee's insufferable kitsch, but not even he is up to the task. And 9/11.

            "content": "`25th Hour' is a version of `Friends\" as `Friends' could hardly understand. Although Edward Norton's life alters forever when he enters prison tomorrow for drug possession, today he says goodbye to family and friends, assesses their value to his life, and asks one friend a favor to beat all favors.His friends include Barry Pepper, an edgy stockbroker; Phillip Seymour Hoffman, an English teacher learning quickly from student Anna Paquin; and Rosario Dawson, his misunderstood lover. The men are all on the edge of antisocial behavior, Hoffman with his 16-year-old student and Pepper with his stock market. Only Dawson seems capable of surviving Norton's next seven years.Director Spike Lee, veering away this time from his signature African-American centricity, has some literate moments such as when he has characters in a apartment talk in front of a window showing work on `Ground Zero,' when he places a `Cool Hand Luke' poster behind Norton (Luke goes to prison as well), or when he frames a brutal sequence in a lovely tunnel arch looking into a park.Norton's angry soliloquy about ethnic groups in New York can't help but remind of Robert De Niro's lonely lines to himself in `Taxi Driver' about the sewer he sees as New York.  Lee is as good as Scorsese in directing these gifted actors.The voice-over dream of Norton's bar-owner father, played by Brian Cox, that Norton escapes to a small town and raises a family, is a melancholy and lyric paean to America's lost innocence.  While that dream may die, friends seem to offer a permanence not allowed to urban wrecks and drug-dealing.\nAs to the favor Norton asks of Pepper, see it to believe it, and remember what Alban Goodier said in `The School of Love': `Even from the best of human friends I must not ask for more than he can give.'",

Well, I'm really glad I finally got a chance to see it. It's easily one of the better films I've seen in a while. I'm not a huge Spike Lee fan, but I loved Do the Right Thing and The Inside Man. I'm not sure if there is any other director whose love for his city is more apparent in their films than Spike Lee. He really does love New York and that love shines through in almost every frame of 25th Hour. That being said, Lee uses the New York backdrop in a very subtle way. The film never turns into a love letter to NYC. Lee is also very classy with the way he deals with the aftermath of 9/11. The 25th Hour includes some solid acting performances from some of today's greatest actors including Ed Norton who plays Monty Brogan, a drug dealer who is about to go to prison. The film follows Monty around town on the night before he goes to jail. He's accompanied by his friends played by Pepper and Hoffman. The film is very much about making choices and how one bad decision can change your life forever. Monty has clearly made some bad choices that have landed him in the situation he is in. At the same time, Hoffman is battling with his feelings for his underage student. He's struggling with urges that he's not sure he can suppress. Making the wrong choice could land him in jail like his friend. The 25th Hour is very much a character study. The plot isn't overly complex and the story doesn't progress like your typical Hollywood film. All in all, the 25th Hour is a haunting portrayal of a broken man (and city) who is hours away from hitting rock bottom.",

            "content": "Spike Lee's '25th Hour' is an emotional story about regret and emotions. Drug dealer Monty Brogan has only about 24 hours before he is to turn himself in. Within these hours he has to figure out who ratted out on him and spend time with his best friends, father and girlfriend while he's terrified of what will happen to him in prison.Now Monty is by no means an ideal citizen but he does win the viewer's sympathy because the viewer identifies with him as a fellow human rather than a drug dealer. There are moments when director Lee successfully manages to conflict the viewer because you know that Monty, who got a scholarship and a bright future ahead, opted instead to make money on other people's addiction.The film is set post September 11, 2001. In a way it's a tribute to all those innocents who lost their lives as the film reminds us of the need to connect with one another and make the best of the little time we have, like Monty does with his friends. The writing is stupendous as the clever dialogues have a poetic rhythm to them while speaking relevant words.'25th Hour' is a well-made film. The slightly washed out colours have a gloomy effect, reflecting the darkness of the theme. The cinematography, score, editing and art direction are first rate.Edward Norton delivers another one of his best performances. He plays his character with finesse and is brilliantly restrained while his co-stars, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper, Brian Cox and Rosario Dawson are just as superb.Spike Lee has done it again. '25th Hour' is a great reminder of how we should make the best of what we have instead of being greedy and taking life for granted.",

            "content": "** Beware, this review contains a spoiler, so if you want to get the most out of this movie, please stop reading here **------------- Do you remember when Johnny Cash did a cover of Trent Reznor's \"Hurt\"? That was quite something, don't you think? How often do the legends pay homage to the younger legends? Aside from Johnny Cash, I can't think of any other instance when the old pays homage to the younger generation. This is probably due to the fact that the cynical older generation believes that the world is going down the tubes. And who can argue? The hole in the ozone layer isn't getting any smaller last time I checked.With all that said, let's imagine Martin Scorsese paying homage to Spike Lee. That would be as noble as Johnny Cash's gesture of thanks to Mr. Reznor. Just a thought, albeit a long-winded one.Instead with 25th HOUR, we're back to the ordinary world of giving thanks to our forefathers. Spike Lee's woozy first-person club shots are an explicit allusion to Scorsese's Mean Streets, and once again we have yet another Scorsese redemption story, this time set against post-911 New York City. As such, I believe that Spike wants us to stand back and observe the state of the union and how we can save our souls and rise above it all. I think Scorsese could relate to that.But let's say you're not feeling so heady tonight, and you just want to kick back and numb your senses with a lot of action and music and stuff. If that's the case I wouldn't quite recommend 25th HOUR. There's really no action or grit, and most of the film relies heavily on one-to-one dialog (not to mention the incessant references to anal rape in prison), against the uneventful backdrop of a bar or living room. If you want to see Edward Norton shine, watch American X instead. His role in 25th HOUR could really be played by anyone. Instead the bright spots of 25th HOUR are without a doubt Barry Pepper and Philip S. Hoffman, who give enough personality to spread over both hours of the movie. And what are we to say about Spike Lee? There's a little non-linear play with the time-line of the story, but that's really it. Now the spoiler ...The aforementioned stuff would leave this movie at a very low 7, but the ending is a class act, and here is how Spike gives his own twist to the Scorsese redemption story. It's hinted that Norton never goes to jail and instead runs west from the law. Regardless of whether his character actually does this or only imagines it, it's a liberating message -- Despite the overly complicated laws and customs that bind modern life, man is and will always be free to roam. What do rules and obligations mean to a man who has two feet and a little change in his pocket? \"You can do it, too. Forget about the house in the suburbs and making it to work on time. Pack your bags, buy a bus ticket, and start all over again.\"I like that.JYJimboduck-dot-com",

This is one of those movies which inspire you to share your fulfilling experience with others.Without doubt, this is one of the best storyline and the acting is spot on. I mean, all characters were so real and identifiable that you could not wonder but imagine a life-like narration going on. I got totally sucked into the movie towards 15 minutes from the start. I have seen Edward Norton deliver the goods before and I had no doubt in my mind that he will not disappoint. But here, he is in a league of a different kind. I really admire his role selection and execution. He has that boyish looks but nonetheless, he is able to fit himself in a wide variety of roles so easily. I look forward to see more of him in such engaging roles.Other then that, the director had devoted considerable footage in developing the other supporting characters as well. This is really great. As one of the comments said, \"it doesn't work when you deviate from the main characters to focus on the supporting characters\". But here, Seymour and Barry's character development is so effective as they are the only friends Edward have and there feelings for Edward basically defines his character.Rosario (Men in Black) and Anna (X-Men) were excellently cast as Edward's love interest and Philip's teen student. They both were young with interests in older men in their life and they delivered quite effectively.Brian Cox as Edward's Father was very real and his repent towards the end for being responsible for what became of Edward was also beautifully portrayed.I appreciate the film at all levels and suggest strongly to watch this alone in your quiet time.

It follows the last day before a man convicted of drug dealing goes to prison for seven years.Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) is a 31-yaar-old guy of Irish descent who's been dealing drugs since the age of 14. He's a dealer for the Russian Mafia locally headed by Uncle Nikolai (Levan Uchaneishvili). Uncle Nikolai's protection for Monty comes through Kostya Novotny (Tony Siragusa), a huge Ukrainian man. Monty has had two best friends since childhood. One is Jacob Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman), an introverted high school English teacher from a wealthy Jewish family. He has a fascination for a 17-year-old girl, Mary (Anna Paquin), in one of his classes. The other is Frank Slaugherty (Barry Pepper), also of Irish background, who is a high-rolling financial player who lives next to Ground Zero. Monty's live-in girlfriend is Naturelle Riviera (Rosario Dawson), whose older sister has been in Monty's class in the private school to which they both had scholarships. Monty's widowed father, James (Brian Cox), is a retired fireman who now runs a bar.The film explores Monty's thoughts as he contemplates what could happen to a younger attractive man in prison and wonders who set him up for his arrest by the Drug Enforcement Agency. It's obvious he was set up since the agents knew exactly where the money and drugs were hidden in his apartment. Through flashbacks, we learn how Monty and Naturelle met and the circumstances of his arrest and brief interrogation. The film also shows how his two friends think Monty will experience prison and whether they will be there for him in seven years.There are two fascinating interludes in the film. In the first Monty rants about everyone and everything he hates in New York City, ending up with himself. In the second, he imagines an alternate ending of escaping to \"The West\" and building a new life for himself.By the end, we do learn who set Monty up.This is an extraordinary story that is artfully presented while being easy to follow. The direction, cinematography, and music fit together seamlessly. The four primary actors are all excellent. I've always been a Philip Seymour Hoffman fan, and he nailed his role of a guy with a compressed personality. Norton, Pepper, and Dawson had easier characterizations to fit, though Norton's rant was excellent.",

Based upon the novel by David Benioff, this film, the first to be granted access to Ground Zero, got an excellent cast of actors who all gave outstanding performances.

The brilliant performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt After watching (and loving) Fight Club I knew when hearing that Edward Norton was starring I had to watch this critically acclaimed 2002 drama, and I'm glad I did. Norton stars as the central protagonist Monty who has been sentenced to 7 years in prison for possessing illegal drugs and wishes to live life before going away. I have watched a few films in my time and I have never watched a film which has been completely dominated by performances and performances alone.Edward Norton may have topped his performance in the 1999 drama Fight Club by acting in a way that only he knows how, to dominate and capture the essence of a troubled soul as he did so brilliantly alongside Brad Pitt three years previously. Norton dives deep within troubled drug dealer Monty and reflects a sombre personality, knowing that the end of your life is waiting around the corner. Through his ability to adjust to such a difficult role, involving crying, shouting and harsh aggressive dialogue, Norton outshines his fellow actors and makes this film what it is through selling emotional ideologies to an audience who will undoubtedly gain an insight into what getting into drugs will do to a strong character. One scene which stood out for me was when Norton was alone in a cubicle facing a mirror. The infamous mirror scene in 'Taxi Driver' involving Robert De Niro will be remembered and Nortoncompletely outshines De Niro, which of course is near to impossible to do, as he berates the world around him, in a nutshell New York. His tantrum extends longer, berates more people, and contains more passion than the most famous Taxi driver scene as Norton strikes out his aggression on different ethnic groups, sex, work, drugs, friends, religions and others. After that scene finished I was left completely gob smacked, rarely have I seen such a scene which captures such a troubled soul, I can't express in words how completely captivating that scene is, and is a MUCH watch for anyone, though watch out for constant swearing, but through the swearing we are able to see how the character really feels, therefore engaging the audience to trust and appreciate the character. The story itself was very captivating with emotional ideologies running throughout, reflecting work, school bizarrely,social scenarios and drug dealings. Through different ideologies director Spike Lee can reflect a real life in the mind of a drug dealer and those around him and these ideas capture the essence of real life magnificently. Many people will question the beginning. When I sat down and saw the opening scene with the dog I did think I was in for something completely bizarre but thankfully it folded out to be a captivating plot involving different persona's and influential ideologies of real life. The ending to was questionable but yet again so was 'Fight Club' but this ending allows the audience to ask questions about what will happen next etc. The club scene towards the end was too long and involved many parts which could have been left out but it captured a real essence about what people go through in their hour of need. Barry Pepper plays terrifically as Norton's best friend. You must also watch the scene towards the end involving his and Norton's confrontation; he is simply terrific as he struggles to cope with what is happening in the world around him. This film is a must watch because it is packed with fantastic performances, and that can be a rarity. Through different personalities I was able to recognise what happens in the drug world and how different people deal with their situations and reflecting real life the film is always believable and appreciative of the genre. A definite watch for people who love drama 8/10",

The film has such complex, deep characters with so many contradictions that make this movie so compelling.

The score, the cinematography, the editing are all spot on. The cast is perfect, particularly great performances by Norton and Pepper. Rosario Dawson is so eye-catching in the film. Lee and the script do a great job touching on the subjects of misplaced rage, race, and distrust.This is the only movie that I've seen that doesn't over-look the anxiety and impending sense of doom for those affected by a conviction-the convicted, and his/her friends or family. Hollywood only seems interested in the show of the trial or the fear and savagery of the prison film.This is just a wonderful drama, that is so moving, and leaves you thinking about it days later. It hits everything right, and mixes the right amount of suspense (who is the Judas?), a perfect touch of humor, and it illustrates the complexity of human relationships among friends, lovers, and family. It just might motivate some to analyze their life choices and consequences, who are those that are true to them, and what matters to them.Only in our society do we find it inhumane for having the state ends someone's life for crimes they've been convicted of, but find it completely humane to have their life end or be taken in a small cell out of the society's view, or to rob them of hope with long sentences and hiring practices regarding convicted felons.",

Spike Lee's direction is very good, and for the crime/urban drama genre, he sure knows what he's doing. Norton gives a great performance, comparable to his stunning work in film such as Fight Club and American History X. Phillip Seymour Hoffman also gives a great performance, one of his best, as a lonely prep school teacher who is Brogan's old friend. Barry Pepper is also very good, playing a Wall Street stock trader, Brogan's other long-time friend. The performances are all almost flawless, with the exception of Dawson and Paquin, which were good, but not at the level of the other actors. Brian Cox was very good, and Siragusa was very funny in his role. The screenplay was very well-written, and certain scenes including Brogan at a night club with his friends in his last couple of horus free are very well done, with great cinematography. The score is also very good, which is also important in a film like this. Overall, another classic performance from Norton, and a great film. 10/10",

I knew of the novel and that many people liked it and I remember the film getting some decent reviews.I also remember it did NO box office. None. So I finally caught it on DVD and I was really surprised. The film is powerful and insightful and full of great acting. Norton is fantastic - so real, so in the moment - his fury and racist speech to himself in the mirror should become a film classic. I can take or leave Spike Lee as a director - some of his stuff is good and some is lame (especially some of his recent stuff) but I thought Lee did a very good job. There were a few times (with jump cuts and colored lights) where he showed off a bit - wheee - look at me, I'm directing --- but many times - he kept the camera still and just filmed good actors doing good work. Pepper's performance blew me away - I didn't know he could be that good. The scenes with him and the always impressive Hoffman were some of the best in the movie. Very well done. I thought about this film long after I saw it. An underrated gem.",

Someone needs to sit him down and have a little conversation with him as to what it takes to direct a movie, and then explain to him why it's only now he's being told this.Why does Spike Lee still not understand the concept of pacing in a movie? How can he not know this? He's been making movies for quite awhile now, how can something so fundamental still escape him? WTF! The least you can expect from a movie is to not want to cause violence towards the director after seeing it, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel like that.The script itself is fine, and in the hands of a competent director, probably would've been an above average movie, if not great. But since this was made by Spike Lee, of course the movie plods along like a snail taking a sight-seeing tour in the grass, and you wanna just smash him over the head and tell him to move it already. The thread of the story is not crisp or focused, it just so happens to have Edward Norton in the scenes, but there's no other connecting factor. As an example, someone please tell me the purpose of the teacher and his little deal with Anna Paquin and her annoying character. Why even introduce that into the story if you're not GOING ANYWHERE WITH IT! Spike Lee's the master of the unfinished subplot!This movie has very bad pacing, as there's no point or sense of purpose to the story they're trying to tell you. I can't compare this with movies with bad story lines (which this doesn't have actually), because at least in those cases, the movie moved along and made progress, had an agenda, and accomplished it, 1,2,3. This movie just kinda stopped at 1 and hung around until the credits were rolling.Spike needs to just stop it already, he's not good at this. His movies make me want to punch him.",

It's like an actor you owe a favour to so you kludge a part onto the script for them. Ed Norton wanders about New York, sure, but what does the city MEAN to him? What memories and feelings and significant events? Nada. He's just walking his dog.The famed \"fuck you New York\" monologue wasn't in the draft of the script I saw, and wasn't justified. What meaning did these people and places have to Ed? Another kludge.The flashbacks. In the writer's commentary Benioff said Lee wanted to avoid tacky 70s-style captions \"Thee weeks previously\" or whatever. They should have used them. I had a hard time figuring out the flashbacks from present day. What's wrong with sacrificing a bit of style if it makes things easy for the viewer? The Barry Pepper character: Lee goes to all the trouble of building a trading floor set so he can show us what a badass risk-taker the character is. Then never uses the information. So what if he has balls of steel? He is never called upon to make a risky decision again. That was screen time wasted. If you want to be thrilled, entertained, mystified and amazed, see something else. The only good thing in this movie is the title sequence with abstract-looking shots of the 9/11 memorial searchlights.",

            "review_title": "The first masterpiece of the 21st Century ...",
            "content": "Like \"Do the Right Thing\", Spike Lee's \"The 25th Hour\" spans 24 hours in New York City, with no rising tension this time, only a deep and contemplative moment in a man's life. Monty Brogan is convicted to a 7-year sentence for drug smuggling after heroin was found in his sofa, the Police knew where to search, which clearly implied a betrayal. But Monty has no time wondering who ratted on him, he screwed up and that's a fact. Spike Lee invites us in the last day of a guy who \"did not the right thing\" for an introspective experience where the achievements of a person are put into equation, and invite the other people that count in his life, and ultimately us viewers, to question ourselves.Spike Lee assembles a splendid cast starting with Edward Norton as Monty Brogan. Norton is a perfect choice because he's a restrained actor and Monty is not emotional, but rather embodies a state of mind, call it lucidity, resignation or wisdom, it's something contained in the deepest part of his heart, maybe like \"Cool Hand Luke\" whose large poster occupies his apartment's wall. And if it's difficult to reach Monty's repressed feelings, Lee helps us through his inner circle: his father James (Brian Cox), an ex-fireman, ex-alcoholic and pub owner, his Puerto-Rican girlfriend Naturelle Riviera (Rosario Dawson) and his two best friends Frank, a cynical Wall Street trader played by Barry Pepper, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Jake, a timid English teacher infatuated with his 16-yaer old pupil Mary (Anna Paquin). And the genius of Spike Lee's film is to hook us to these characters without distracting us from the main story.The film owes a lot to the masterful screenplay adapted by the novel's author David Benioff. It's a rich and multi-layered masterpiece about different people whose hearts converge to Monty Brogan and also to the last (but not least) character of the film: New York City. Like other directors such as Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen, Spike Lee has New York in his veins, but in \"The 25th Hour\", the town is not in its usual state, it's recovering from another wound, the September 11 attacks. The film is the first major production post-September 11th (hence my title, since there 's a major consensus that the 21st century commenced that day) and the mark of the terrorist attacks is still palpable. When Jacob visits Frank's house, the camera overlooks the sight of Ground Zero, has Frank through of moving out? Hell no, he wanted the sight of the World Trade Center, and he'll stick with it, it's his f-word to Al-Qaeda.But Lee doesn't use New York to be patriotic, or to drift his film into politics. New York is just a fitting background for characters who embraced its best and worst values, Frank is a trader, he belongs to a category that put more people in poverty and hunger than Monty would ever did. Monty's father was an inconsolable alcoholic who closed his eyes on his son's 'business' as long as it paid his loans like politicians closing their eyes on the practices of Enron and other corporations that lead the world to bankruptcy. The stories of the characters provide a microcosmic view of New York, and contribute to the film's most powerful moment during which Edward Norton finally loses his temper and delivers a f-words loaded rant against all the worms that populate the Big Apple, mirroring the famous racist montage from \"Do The Right Thing\".Monty insults the multi-ethnic population of New York City, every demographic category, then extrapolates to the greater with religion: JC, Bush, Al Qaeda, then to his friends, his father before realizing he's the one to blame, and must assume. He spends the rest of the night for a farewell nightclub party where they also meet Jake's student, Mary. And progressively, during that night, the character's arc closes in a fluid and smoothly handled way; Lee never sins by over-directing or over-editing. Probably inspired by Frank's speech, Jacob kisses Mary as his f-word to good behavior. Lee's trademark gliding shot represents then a man who just did what he thought was right and was ready to assume the consequences.And so is Monty, who never seems resentful for having smuggled drug, but rather blames himself for being too greedy. All he knows is that he'll never come back the same, whether he spends time in prison or escapes, the alternative of killing himself being unthinkable. Monty is in an existential dead-end, but a magnanimous turn of events provides information about the traitor, and relieves Monty from a torturing weight. He's lucid about his fate but all the faces he threw f-bombs at during the rant, smile at him during his last ride to prison, for a magnificent conclusion with a unique dream-like quality, where New York City stops being the center of the world, and when the father imagines a way to bypass his son's existential dead-end.\"The 25th Hour\" inspired me so many feelings I would know where to start, but right now I feel like deliver a 10-minute rant asking why such a magnificent performance, one of the greatest films of the last decade didn't get one lousy Oscar nomination: Best Actor for Edward Norton, Best Supporting Actor for Barry Pepper (the scene where he replies to Monty's last request always cut straight to my heart, what an actor!), I would even give one to Cox for his monologue delivery, Best Screenplay, this goes without saying, Best Directing, Editing, Cinematography, Picture, and ironically, the most unforgivable, Best Score for Terence Blanchard's soul-penetrating music. First, \"Do The Right Thing\", then \"Malcolm X\" and then \"The 25th Hour\", Spike Lee makes passionate, personal, haunting and entertaining movies, yet constantly gets overlooked by the Academy, what a shame!\"The 25th Hour\" or the best film of the 2000's, period.",

The film shows the last 24 hours of his freedom and how he re-assesses his life, the decisions he took, his relationships with friends, his girlfriend, father etc.Edward Norton is very good (as usual) in the lead role of Monty - 31 year old ex-drug dealer/scholarship student and future convict. He is supported by a good supporting cast comprising of Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Rosario Dawson, X-Girl Anna Paquin, Brian Cox and an especially impressive Barry Pepper as his best buddy.

He can do angry very well, he can do provocative very well, he can even do \"issues\" very well - BUT he can't do STORY!Which is a real shame. I started out loving this film. I have a lot of respect for Edward Norton and Phillip Seymour-Hoffman, and plenty of time for Anna Paquin and \"the other guy\", and I really thought that this film was going to BE something. And it wasn't - arrrrrgh!!!First the plus points:Norton was excellent as always. Seymour-Hoffman was pretty good, temporarily having set aside his \"I want to be Richard Redford in 'All the President's Men'\" ticks, and the rest of the cast was pretty passable.I thought the \"F--- You\" monologue was fascinating, if a little politically correct.Now the minus points....The premise is wonderful - what would YOU do if you (effectively) had but 24 hours to live? What a brilliant concept upon which to build a film! BUT Spike Lee totally squanders this great premise! AAAAArrrrgh!! Sum this film up - \"Nice Guy At Heart but Drug Dealer\" gets caught has last night out with mates at nightclub and..... nothing HAPPENS!!!! Correction - entirely predictable clich\u00e9ed Russian gangster action happens.We are, at the beginning, sucked into believing that interesting plot lines will develop e.g. What will happen to the \"cowboy\" Trader? Will he get caught out? Will something meaningful develop between the Teacher (Hoffman) and his student (Paquin)? We are led to believe that the fates of the three principal characters will intertwine in some meaningful way and influence the outcome of the film, but in fact what really happens is that Spike Lee seems to completely forget about these parallel plotlines halfway though, and they remain unresolved and completely superfluous to the fate of the principal character, played by Ed Norton, and whose name I have by now forgotten. WHAT is the purpose of these characters???? What influence (for example) does Anna Paquin's character have on the fate of the principal character? ANSWER = Nil. Or Seymour-Hoffman's character???? They don't make Norton better or worse, they don't influence his actions - they are merely CYPHERS!The final 15 minutes or so - BAAAAAAD. Have you seen the dream resolution of \"Raising Arizona\"? Spike rips this off, and in such a clumsy manner. Did he do this deliberately? If he did (and I'm sure someone will SAY he did) then he chose to end his film in a style completely at odds with the mood of the film prior to this.And finally, just WHAT significance do the constant references to \"9/11\" have to the storyline? Someone tell me please? Is there some subliminal reference to the development of Norton's character, or did Spike simply feel that he wished to re-establish himself as All-American?\nIt's not often I feel obliged to contribute here, but I just feel so disappointed I must.Spike - if you're going to start some good plotlines, don't just leave them hanging!An overall 6/10 for excellent acting throughout from all.",

It should also be noted there is an alternate ending on the disc, and are dramatically different. Either way, it shows the powerful impact this tragedy had on everyone's psyche who lived there then, followed by the collective strength of the city and all the people to come back from such an attack. His talent as a director is shown by how deftly his touch is, to communicate such a powerful thing, all the while by doing so visually, in the background; not speaking about it at all.

Why does Spike Lee add those weird double take effects?  I can only see one scene where it might have been appropriate.  I don't need to know that the director knows how to add that effect.There is NO character development . . . NONE. There is NO plot development . . . NONE.I can understand the ending if the movie builds up to Norton's character deciding to flee. But he doesn't; and at the end of the movie, I ask myself why did I sit through 2 hours to peek into 12 hours of someone's plain and ordinary life.  The flashbacks are sprinkled throughout the movie horribly.\nThe only poignant moment is when the father describes his escape and fugitive life.  That's the only time when I thought if I could stay under the radar.I'm an Ed Norton fan, but his acting is becoming quite repetitive.  You see his 'The Score' character and 'Fight Club' character recurring in this movie.In all, this was quite disappointing.",

            "content": "With the release of 25th Hour, Spike Lee has been blamed for 'going middle of the road'; for 'going white', for 'going Hollywood'. The film has also been accused of being too slow, too atmospheric, too indulgent, with no plot. Of course, it was only two years before that Lee's previous creation, 'Bamboozled', was blamed for being too provocative, too racially focused, too in-your-face, and with too many contrived plot turns. It seems he just can't win these days; it seems quite obvious to me that these two films, very different though they are, are his best creations in a long time \u0096 since 1992's 'Malcolm X' at least \u0096 and both are fantastic and original films, among my favorites.It's true that there is very little going on in '25th Hour', but a lot is happening beneath the surface; while it raises none of the racial issues we may somehow expect from Lee, it's a very powerful \u0096 if subtle \u0096 social commentary, about post-9/11 New York City. Other than being the first major piece of fiction to refer to the disaster from a personal viewpoint, and that much can be seen from the beautiful montage of footage from the WTC monument that follows the moody opening scene. Lee's approach to this difficult and provocative subject is very real and very personal, and it's clearly from the viewpoint of a real New-Yorker. And although Ground Zero at WTC serves mainly as a backdrop and the attack is referred to directly only once in the film, it's hard not to see the important connection between the story of New York's disaster, and the personal disaster of New Yorker Monty Brogan.25th Hour is as much an achievement for Spike Lee as it is for lead actor Edward Norton; and I consider it the final piece in a trilogy of fantastic films that clearly based Norton as one of the leading actors of his generation, a rise that began four years earlier with American History X and Fight Club (sadly, Norton has not again fulfilled his potential since 25th Hour, but I'm still waiting to see what he has to offer). Norton's portrayal of Monty Brogan is moving and complex; Brogan is a drug dealer, but he's not necessarily a bad guy \u0096 he's a man who made some bad decisions, and is now paying for them. And even though Norton is supported by a fantastic, first rate cast \u0096 one that includes Brian Cox, Rosario Dawson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper and Anna Paquin \u0096 it's clearly his show, and he makes the most of it. Norton brings Monty to life as a classic anti-hero, and he's as fascinating a protagonist as the characters he played in Fight Club and American History X. 25th Hour is an atmospheric and intense character study, and Norton's performance makes it perfect.That can be seen most clearly in the infamous mirror monologue, which was attacked most vigorously by the film's critics, and hailed most enthusiastically by its supporters. That scene harks back to a very similar scene that Lee did many years before in his celebrated masterpiece 'Do The Right Thing', but it provokes a very different meaning. Like the scene in 'Do The Right Thing', the mirror scene is a perfect example of one of the things I love most about Lee as a director, and one that constantly angers his critics, is his uncompromising approach for provocation and straightforwardness; Lee never felt any need to be too subtle or to dodge artfully around painful subjects like racism, and in this scene he tackles the problems of post-9/11 head on, and with no fear of stirring things up. It's a powerful and difficult scene, one of the boldest made in recent years, and by itself it makes the film memorable.25th Hour is poetry; if it sometimes seems slow, it's because the important action is all below the surface, in the soul of Monty Brogan, and in all the lost souls of New York City. It's probably the most atmospheric piece Lee has pulled, but it's a beautiful work, and is well recommended for fans of Lee's and Norton's both. It's an unnerving and unsettling experience, but well worth the admission.",

Featuring a choppy cinematography especially during its dialog, this two hour and fifteen minute, meandering road to nowhere details the last 25 hours of a pinched drug dealer's free life and seems to actually take twenty-five hours to do it. On the plus side, Norton's monologue on New York is amusing in its audacity, taking on issues from hasidic jewelers to Osama Bin Ladin in a five minute rant that would make Dennis Miller blush. Other than this and a few chuckles this movie s full of issues from not really knowing how it ended to the fact that in Spike Lee's fantasy world you're allowed to drive yourself to prison after not having a trial to convict you of drug trafficking. * 1/2",

I do not feel I fit into his key demographic. I do not say this to be racist (I'm not), but I think his audience is not young white males. Though, I could be wrong, and \"25th Hour\" is an exception.Edward Norton plays Monty Brogan, who is busted for drug possession and has one day of freedom before a seven year stint in prison. He is joined on his last day by his girlfriend (Rosario Dawson), his teacher friend (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and the teacher's student, played by Anna Paquin.The story asks us if committing crimes is worth the time, and if the time is a fitting punishment, knowing a life will be thrown away. Spike Lee takes a very loose perspective on this, seemingly blaming the cops for busting Brogan rather than blaming Brogan for dealing drugs.Along with this is the idea of \"innocense\". How is Brogan innocent? Also, he meets his girlfriend in a schoolyard when she is eighteen and he is older. This parallels Hoffman's attraction to Anna Paquin, who is also a student. When is this relationship acceptable and when is it criminal? Steering away from the minority outlook (most clearly expressed in \"Malcolm X\"), Spike Lee scores with a tale that most people can relate to or at least sympathize with. Light on action and light on comedy, the drama of this wasted life will leave you thinking.",

Aside from one amazing scene this movie is hardly worth watching.

The movie is literally as boring as my life, which is sad for the viewers and for me as well. It's 7. whatever rating stems from the fact that people don't look at this movie objectively. Take away Edward Norton and Phillip Hoffman and ignore the fact that Spike Lee directed it, this movie would not be popular I assure you.

            "content": "25th Hour right in the title speaks to what could, or should, or would, be done in that time left or not really used in the day that a person finds beneficial, or revelatory. This 25th Hour may be shown in this film as in the end sequence, as Brian Cox describes to Edward Norton a dream-life, which becomes wrenchingly bittersweet as the real situation is sitting in the backseat of a car. But for the bulk of the picture, Spike Lee and writer David Benioff draw out a series of machismo-driven conversations, a little moments of drug-fueled bits of malaise and discontent (and all connected to the whole existential notion at work with Edward Norton's Monty), and with one of the great sequences Lee has ever done stuck in the middle. Norton plays Monty with the purest kind of strength that we've seen in the best of Norton, particularly in American History X. Here his decisions that lead him to a jail sentence are not race-driven but by way of Rockerfeller drug laws in New York City. Over one night, before heading out, he will have talks, make peace, and discuss things with friends Barry Pepper and Philip Seymour Hoffman, with a girl (Anna Paquin) and father Cox, in the background.It's been a little while since I've seen 25th Hour, but that so much of it still sticks out long after its theatrical release and screenings on TV, is a credit to the trio at work here- star Norton, writer Benioff, and director Lee. Some shots may end up lingering to the point of exhaustion, though perhaps that might be the point; Lee strikes up in the immediate post 9/11 world a couple of really striking images that are always in the background for these guys, that something much more horrifying and delirious is at work aside from their well paying jobs (legal or not) and their possibly crumbling friendships. In a way it's a lot more like pulp material than Lee might really call it out as. But it still rings more or less like vintage Lee. The sequence mentioned before as the great scene, which invariably echoes moments from his masterwork Do the Right Thing, is when Norton talks to a mirror, the 'f***-you' speech, where the hate is not exclusive, but all-inclusive, including himself. Such a topic is only touched upon for so long, which is why the focus of the film- slightly scattered- for me keeps it from being as spectacular as it COULD be, as opposed to just being a very good movie.Still, out of the big cannon of work that Lee has produced in twenty years, which amounts to over two dozen films and TV specials, I'd recommend this quite highly out of the lot of em. Having Cox as the father, for example, is a very special bet, as his talents as a bona-fide character come in handy when dealing with someone who is well-rounded, to compliment the full, complex and tortured dimensions of Norton's caring-for-dog-but-not-of-much-else Monty. Pepper and Hoffman are also dependable, with Paquin sort of drifting in and out as the E'd up girl who is least likely to know what she'll want even after she snaps out of her drugged state. To go alongside that 'f***-you' speech in visceral terms, is the key moment in the morning for the three friends in the park, which I wont mention here, but attains a power that is comparable cinematically to Scorsese. In the end, Lee has with the 25th Hour a compendium of ultimate loss, combined with a city in loss, and then disillusioned hope and despair. Not very cheerful, and it almost makes it the director's bleakest film. But it's still quite memorable years down the line. A- (8.5/10)",

            "content": "This is one Spike Lee joint that I'm definitely smoking. A film that received a weak release from Disney's Buena Vista/Touchstone Pictures and consequently made barely $13 million, \"25th Hour\" is a gem that many will stumble upon (such as myself) and pat themselves on the back for a good find. David Benioff pulls off one of the better self-written-book-to-screenplay adaptations possibly ever, especially for a guy with no prior screen writing experience at the time. The scenes are elegant (with some help from director Lee) and the messages both real and potent. The story centers around Montgomery Brogan (Edward Norton), who has just been busted by the DEA for dealing and wants to make the most of his final 24 hours before getting locked up.But \"25th Hour\" is no \"drugs 'n thugs\" drama. Monty's drug-dealing life stays in the periphery of the film with hardly so much as a reference. Benioff and Lee are much more concerned with the concept of a man about to pay a tough price for a past mistake and how he might view the world and handle the relationships with those closest to him.Monty chooses first to visit his father (Brian Cox) that evening. Meeting at the bar his father owns where he primarily serves cops and fire fighters (keep in mind the film was made in a barely post-9/11 NYC setting), he takes a bathroom break where a simple \"f*** you\" message written on the mirror sends him on a voice-over monologue tirade, uttering aforementioned curse about every single sect of the Big Apple's population before laying it on himself. Lee, whose love for the city of New York is anything but a secret, continues his tradition of the city as a character in this way. Monty is mostly angry at himself, but he has something to get off his chest, which is that no one, not even the millions of New Yorkers not going to jail, are free of flaws. Dealing and letting it get too far was Monty's flaw and simply he must pay for it.The rest of the night takes place predominantly at a night club run by the man Monty works for, Uncle Nikolai. He brings along his two closest friends, Frank (Barry Pepper) and Jake (Philip Seymour Hoffman) as well as his girlfriend, Naturelle (Rosario Dawson), who he believes might have ratted on him about the money stored up in his apartment that the feds found. The film favors its ensemble heavily, providing each actor a terrific opportunity to show multiple facets to his or her character. Pepper usually fills in screen space in most films, but he complicates his investment broker character by making him flip from self-assured to emotionally confused. Hoffman works his subtlety as a high school teacher clearly not in control of his life when his student (Anna Paquin) flirts with him. Dawson plays nicely off the script's implication that she might have secrets to hide.Aside from the poor casting of NFL player Tony Siragusa as a key character and some odd epic fantasy battle scoring from longtime Lee collaborator Terence Blanchard, \"25th Hour\" is near-perfect execution of a story taking place in a short time window: no overly dramatic plot twists, but character-building and message-fueled dialog with a strong application of epiphany. All the more beautiful is how it echoes the post-9/11 message of enduring despite yourself or someone else pummeling you to the point where it appears there is nothing left.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",

I don't think Monty has done anything to CHANGE HIS LIFE IN ONE DAY except for making Frank beat him up. Jacob's little love affair is also too superficial and meaningless to the whole story, if it is meant to portray the last day of Monty's life before going to jail.OK.

Barry Pepper is outstanding and getting closer to being able to carry a movie.  The genius of Philip Seymour Hoffman (compare this role to his in \"Punch Drunk Love\") is evident again.  The absolute best character actor working today!  What a tormented and confused soul, but a good person at heart.  Brian Cox (challenging John C.

It's a deep cast - Rosario Dawson is excellent in this among others - and there is authenticity in the relationships these characters have with one another, making for lots of fine scenes. Perhaps the most interesting is when Norton explodes at a long string of ethnic groups while looking at himself in the mirror, only to ultimately curse himself, realizing his own damning culpability, because of the possible parallel to the events of 9/11.

            "content": "\"Maybe we should start asking ourselves what was going on in those towers and in that Pentagon.\" - Father Tom Hopko On September the 11th, 2001, fifteen Saudi Arabians, 1 Lebanese and an Egyptian attacked the United States of America. The focal point of their attacks were the World Trade Center buildings in New York City. Why these men did what they did, why they focused on the WTC buildings and why the majority came from Saudi Arabia, a brutally repressive nation which has had an unholy, unspoken Alliance with the United States for over half a century, were swiftly ignored by the United States. Instead, the attacks were used as a pretext to launch US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan.Spike Lee's \"The 25th Hour\" is typically viewed, by fans, as a film which is vaguely about the \"resilience of New Yorkers\" and \"the tragedy of 9/11\". It's viewed as a film which \"mourns for a city which was unfairly scarred\". The film's actual message is more disturbing: America reaped what it sowed and needs to take responsibility for its past. Shocking? Lee's the kind of guy who doesn't give a damn what you think. Or maybe he just reads history books.\"Hour\" opens with a powerful title sequence. We see \"The Tribute In Light\", an art installation used to commemorate the site of the demolished WTC buildings. The film then sees drug dealer Monty, played by Edward Norton, responding to a wounded dog whose painful cries occur off-screen. Monty rescues the dog and later claims that this act \"was the only good thing he's done in his life\". Significantly, or perhaps unintentionally, the mangled, black-and-white body of the dog resembles the corpse of a bomb victim. \"Hour's\" middle portion focuses on three characters: drug dealer Monty, school teacher Jake (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Wall Street stockbroker Frank (Barry Pepper). All three characters shirk responsibility (Monty symbolically drives a Dodge), all wasted a life of privilege and all are directly or indirectly responsible for much misery. Monty sells crack to kids, Jake abuses his position of authority and Frank, who's repeatedly linked to the WTC buildings, and so the heart of globalized capitalism, uses his market muscles to crush and strangle.When Monty is arrested and learns that he has but 24 hours of freedom before being sent to jail, his friends contemplate their buddy's incarceration. Before an open window, which displays 9/11's ground zero like rape scars on a city, they talk of responsibility, justice and the fact that Monty deserves his upcoming jail time. \"I love him like a brother, but he f*****g deserves it,\" Frank growls. Lee then uses several sequences to examine the hypocrisy of Frank, Jake and Monty's lover, Naturale, all of whom hypocritically expect Monty to shoulder responsibility, but whom fail to assess their own complicity and contributions. What culpability, Lee asks, do Americans share?Interestingly, the victims of Monty's drug-dealings, and Frank and Jake's own actions, aren't shown. The violence from which America's rewards are reaped \u2013 hidden, but the very bedrock of her privilege - remain off-screen, like the dog's cries. But these sins must be atoned for, leading to the film's final act, in which Monty frets about entering a prison in which he will undoubtedly be raped. He thus asks Frank to \"make him ugly\", Frank pummelling Monty's face so that other convicts won't think Monty a middle-class pretty boy. The symbolism is hilariously literal: America must confront and atone for her ugliness if she wish not be \"raped\".9/11 bogeyman, Osama Bin Laden, himself touched upon the idea of social responsibility: \"the American people,\" he said, \"choose their government, a choice which stems from their agreement to its policies. They are the ones who fund and have consented to the attacks against us, and they are the ones who oversee the expenditure of these monies in the way they wish, through their elected candidates.\" Bin Laden's stance of collective responsibility is itself intertwined, in complex ways, with both Western and Eastern violence (\"Every target is legitimate\" - Dan Halutz).Lee's later films have become increasingly concerned with the larger effects of institutions, and now tend to filter race and class issues through the broader lens of globalisation. Many also deliberately invert the racial stereotypes of his earlier pictures, \"Hour\" included, which goes out of its way to present us with white drug dealers and black cops. One scene deliberately points to New York's Rockefeller Laws, historically designed to keep blacks locked away and off the streets. This social inversion occurs within Lee's prison walls as well, where power structures are reversed and so \"favour\" minorities. Black thus becomes white, white becomes black, middle class becomes lower and so on, forcing an acknowledgement of social divisions and/or inequalities.\"Hour\" contains a now famous, and wholly overwrought, sequence in which Monty unleashes a stereotype-laden diatribe against different ethnic and racial groups. The scene points to the heterogeneity of New York, its dividedness, each neighbourhood like a nation at war with the other. Here, Monty, who yells before a mirror (which features pictures of American flags and the Twin Towers), essentially blames the \"Other\" for his \"rape\", and so places the responsibility for 9/11 on \"them\". This scene recalls the \"racial slurs\" scene in Lee's \"Do The Right Thing\", though here Monty eventually revokes his rant and personally accepts responsibility. In this way, \"Hour\" advocates against outward violence (and escapism) as a means of dealing with 9/11, and instead seeks to incite self-reflection. The US invaded Iraq three months after Lee's film was released.8.5/10 \u2013 After Hollywood (Scorsese et al) had all but stripped the genre of everything but its surface style, Lee, modelling his film on \"Germany, Year Zero\" and \"Rome, Open City\", puts the politics back into Neorealism.",

            "content": "What would you do with the last twenty-four hours of your life? No, this doesn't star Kiefer Sutherland: This is \"25th Hour,\" the tale of a man sentenced to a minimum of seven years in prison for drugs. That man, Montgomery (Edward Burns), nicknamed Monty, says goodbye to his girlfriend (Rosario Dawson), meets his Irish-American father (Brian Cox) for a beer, and spends the night with his friends. The entire time, the idea that this may be the last day of his life as he currently knows it is stamped firmly on his mind.\"25th Hour\" is directed by Spike Lee, who is without a doubt one of America's most controversial filmmakers. What I believe separates him from other directors in a sense is that he makes films usually dealing primarily with African-Americans, and this caused outrage back in the ol' days before this was standard fare. But he also exploits blacks in a way that the black community dislikes Lee. Many films about African-Americans (like \"Friday\" and such) are there soley for the purpose of trying to cash in with the black audience and cause upset with the more clean-cut Americans. They don't show blacks as they are. Now, I'm not African-American, but I somewhat doubt that all blacks are like Ice Cube and Chris Tucker. Spike Lee knows this. He doesn't have an ego getting in his way; he shows African-Americans the way they are, not just stereotypical African-American film figures, which causes a lot of upset with his films very often. Whites didn't like his movies because they dealt with blacks; blacks didn't like his movies because they showed them in a different light than usual. He's a true director, not one hiding behind cliches.At least that's what I hear. I haven't seen many of Lee's films, but I was enthusastic to pick up \"25th Hour\"--and it was often quite good, often quite dull. Sometimes I really enjoyed the film; other times I thought it was being a bit too long in certain areas. Such a long scene is one where Monty goes to a nightclub the night before his sentence starts and chats with his friends (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper). I get the idea already.Norton (\"Fight Club\") is a great actor--he's been on my list of \"up-and-coming greats\" since \"The Score\" with Robert De Niro, in which Norton played a mentally retarded man who isn't actually retarded. Hey, he's not as good as Dustin Hoffman at doing the whole Rain Man thing, but he's still a tremendous young actor with an aspiring future.\nBut hey, a lot of this movie was good, and for that I give it a wholehearted recommendation. It's a good movie, with some good ideas and dialogue. Just don't expect a jawdropper.3.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",

Many perspectives all at once. Spike is clearly not just an important African American voice - he has grown to be clearly an important American voice. Possibly our most important. I was sure their must have been something wrong with this film when Oscar didn't shine on it (I hadn't seen it to that point). How this film was missed I will never understand. The performances of all where nuanced and heart felt. The camera direction was classic. None of the wasted moves of the modern \"Music Video\" driven director. Every shot meant something (can't remember many films the last couple of years I can say that about). The score was also a surprise. I expected a street cred kind of theme and instead it rang of Taxi Driver and the classics. Long live Spike.",

            "content": "Few movies nowadays earn the term of classic. This is one of them.I believe that having a \"few\" comes from the policy of the new Hollywood, where the GCI, the technical pedantry, and the absence of a story that touch the hearts and minds, or the absence of a story anyway, rule.I loved (25th Hour). It centers on the moral choice. And what a world it revolves in, where all the characters are sinful. (Monty Brogan/Edward Norton) sold drugs for kids and went greedy, (Frank Slaughtery/Barry Pepper) didn't advise his friend, (Jacob Elinsky /Philip Seymour Hoffman) didn't care about his friend, or maybe didn't know about it, though both ways he was afraid of living or taking any choice in his own life, (Naturelle Riviera/Rosario Dawson) loved being rich without asking many questions, (James Brogan/Brian Cox) was a lousy drunken father who, while being an ex-fireman, couldn't extinguish the one in his home. And all what he had lastly was a dream of a happy life that wouldn't happen.(Spike Lee) was never saner. Now this is the American classic movie for him. The big cadres, the flirting with the city of New York, the orchestrated music, the least amount of technical games.. all of that pushed me to think that I was watching a work by one of the 1950s finest Hollywood directors.Speaking about music, I was amazed by (Terence Blanchard)'s work. His music played a deep total role in uplifting the characters and the event. It got a halo of venerability due to its fearful sorrow. It was one effective, and attractive, dirge. I think this movie would have lost considerable part of its weightiness without it.There are some artistic points that typified the drama without any din. Like overflowing the scene of the police integration in white color. Here is where (Monty) meets the naked truth, there is no escape, and maybe this is the beginning of his purgation. Or seeing (Elinsky/Seymour Hoffman) on a dolly right after kissing the girl who he feels charmed by, the thing about (Elinsky) is that he has a teen inside of him who didn't live his life. So this moment wasn't something special inasmuch as a freedom for that suppressed, rather prisoner, teen inside, despite that what he did wasn't, in the logic's eyes, a moral choice; so unlike the lead, he selected the immoral one to get out of prison.And the speech of (Monty) in the bathroom in which he says the F word 39 times towards all who he knows, or what he sees. Then exposes how his real anger is towards himself, gainsaying all what he was saying, giving the forty F to (Montgomery Brogan) who blew it big time. Now that's a moral choice, but in so late time.However, there were some points that I didn't like. For one, is that the movie gets the history of (Monty) out of the picture, so I didn't know what was his motive to sell drugs as a career. \"My mother died, my father is a drunk\" wasn't an enough, convincing, reason. For another, (Edward Norton). Don't get me wrong, the man did his best, but I just didn't see him as (Montgomery Brogan) in the first place. He seems too soft to be a street dealer, too pure - or too rich - to be in that neighborhood. Yes, (Monty) is supposed to look handsome or childish so he scared of jail, but I thought (Norton) wasn't that similar to him anyway.There was a big buzz about the scene of ground zero (the remains of the World Trade Center after the attacks of 9/11/2001). Many asked about (Lee)'s real intentions of capturing it, and through that specific scene between (Slaughtery) and (Elinsky). Some said that (Lee) implies that America is (Monty); deserved what happened to it. Some said that it is the time to get together, and face the pain of casualty. Well, regardless of feeling a little bore with the way that scene was made, I don't see this or that, it's just a reference to a big loss, the end of something (the future of Monty, the relationship with his friends), and the try of living with something ugly after; or not easily healable scar. Otherwise, (Lee) found the location too valuable to be left out, deeming it so worthy of capturing, and anyhow it merged with the movie's main feel of sadness and bereavement.No doubt that the best about it is that it has a competent power to push you into this character's horrible fate, being also - as a whole - like an epitome of the human's journey in life, and in one moment where he's going to his end (as if the inferno), leaving a sinful life, an age of hate not love, and the impossibility to go back and pick out the moral choice. Because, simply, there is no 25th hour to fix what happened in the already 24 ones. Hence, that last sequence seems like a good slap in the face of all the old, more dreamy, Hollywood movies where the lead gets a happy end even if forcedly.It makes us talk too much about many beautiful and affective matters in it. That's not awfully common in the movies of nowadays. Let me be cynical to say that this kind of movies is being made, at today's Hollywood, in the 25th hour!",

This film supports my theory that he is in fact the best actor ever. Chock up another point for the scientific method. This film was mistakenly labeled as \"Action\" by my local video rental store. As such, I was expecting a high adrenaline story about a drug dealer who goes out on a last hurrah (by shooting people) before he goes to jail. This was VERY far off from what the film actually was. It's actually a drama. And not just any drama, one of the most emotional dramas I have ever seen. Edward Norton (brilliantly) plays Montgomery, a reformed drug dealer who is going to have to go to jail for 7 years to pay for his crime. Seems pretty basic. The majority of the movie shows Monty's last dealings with his friends and family before this. The movie sucks the viewers into the mindset of those about to be shipped off to prison and the fear, anxiety, and dread held within said mindset. The true emotional punch comes towards the end as...eh, I won't spoil it for you. This movie is amazing. Go watch it. Now.",

To attempt to tell the story of a heroin dealer in his last 24 hours of freedom before starting a 7-year jail term is in itself pretty challenging, since we're being asked to sympathise with someone who's basically a nasty character. The fact that Norton's performance is so understated - for almost all the film he's seen numbed with shock at the knowledge that he's about to be sent to an extremely rough jail and, as he is all too aware, brutalised by the tougher inmates - only exacerbates the problem. 2) Philip Seymour Hoffman is arguably the greatest living American actor. The long shot where, having just drunkenly kissed his teenage student, he emerges from the women's toilet, his face tilted upwards, enraptured, as if at a descending angel, will stay with me for a very long time. 3) The film's treatment of the Rosario Dawson character is misogynist. 4) The end is one of the most bizarre and frustrating I've seen in the cinema for quite a while.",

I read some comments and some people thinks it is the emotions they liked but the only emotion I felt was boredom.

The film chronicles his last day of freedom as he spends time with his loved ones. The acting was actually pretty good but some story elements should have been left in the cutting room floor.To begin with, the story meanders for quite sometime. It takes too long to introduce the characters. Barry Pepper's introduction scene at work, for instance, took away from the gist of Monty's story. So did an incongruous subplot involving Philip Seymour Hoffman and Anna Paquin. Spike Lee also tried to incorporate 9/11 images into the narrative. What was probably meant as tribute came off as wasted and mishandled opportunity. And the question of who ratted Monty out to the DEA agents was not a burning issue even though it seems it should have been. It is not Lee's fault so much as the silliness of the script.My verdict: Uneven film that overstays its welcome at a running time of 135 minutes.",

And maybe that's where the truth lies: a drug dealer is a human being indeed, and Montgomery Brogan is definitely one of the best examples for this statement. As the slogan of the movie indicates: \"He didn't give up his dreams but postponed them for a while\". And this sentence is enough to describe the whole film.

I mentioned in one sentence how the picture was analogical to 9/11--the reason I revisited it for the 20th anniversary--but in the vein particularly of some of my earlier reviews, I neglected to elaborate as to how so, or so what, before proceeding to rattle on about something more mundane. If I'm lucky, I'll look back in 17-or-so years from now and wonder why this submission is so poorly written.\"25th Hour\" is one of Spike Lee's best and most subtle films. One does get the sense of a New York filmmaker in mourning here, with the story of Ed Norton's Monty on the eve of his seven-year prison sentence standing in for the city and country after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The world coming to an end and another, uncertain one approaching in its place. He may threaten to go over the top with those final pans of faces reflecting Norton's earlier hate-filled monologue in front of a mirror, but I think we're ultimately spared. The final, ambiguous dream sequence is especially poignant in this regard, of lives \"so close to never happening.\" And, rightly, the picture ends there, with lives that may happen or may be extinguished.That day was such a trauma, too, that, perhaps, it rather forces filmmakers to be more subdued in even alluding to it. It's not only Lee in this case. Another filmmaker, for instance, who I'd never confuse with subtlety, Robert Zemeckis, managed to never mention the fate of the Twin Towers in \"The Walk\" (2015). Indeed, the only movie I've seen in the several 9/11 films I've reviewed for this anniversary that doesn't confer this sort of respect for what happened and, instead, digs into the crassest of schmaltz is also the only such title to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. Go figure, but this is the same Academy that only nominated one of Lee's films when he bluntly included news footage at the end of it as if to scream at everyone that this is what the picture was really about.Here, we only get images of the \"Tribute in Light,\" of vertical searchlights representing the fallen Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, within an opening credits sequence that plays like a city symphony--a more somber, post-9/11 version of, say, an opening sequence such as that of Woody Allen's \"Manhattan\" (1979), and all of which recalls a genre going back to the silent era that's often credited with having begun with \"Manhatta\" (1921), modernists painter Charles Sheeler and photographer Paul Strand's avant-garde documentary take on Manhattan as spliced together with quotations from poet Walt Whitman. And, later, a view of crews working at Ground Zero as framed through the window of one character's apartment. The entire picture, really, is framed through this post-9/11 landscape, but there's no need to relentlessly assault the spectator with that fact.It doesn't take much when already attuned to this theme before I start wondering how the littlest things in the picture might be allusions: what does his being beat in the face say about that, for instance, and its repetition of the recovery of the beaten dog at the beginning, the American flags and the spiel about starting over out West, or are the Twin Towers why he has two friends, two lives, or does it explain Lee's otherwise peculiar decision to employ the dated transitioning technique of temporal replays (an effect that may've been introduced way back by early cine-magician Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s (see the replay from two angles of the rocket hitting the Moon's eye in \"A Trip to the Moon\" (1902), e.g.) before the standard grammar of continuity editing was invented). Whether or not Monty's slamming a car trunk door twice or that we see his embrace of someone from two different angles is intentionally done to suture the spectator within this doubled allusion, commiserating on our shared mourning doesn't so much matter as the fact that Lee and company allow the room for that interpretation to be found and not spoon-fed.All of which is even more remarkable because Lee directed the adaptation of a book by the same author that pre-dated 9/11 and as originally purchased by Tobey McGuire before he went on to star in \"Spider-Man\" (2002) instead. But, Lee wisely realized he couldn't do this adaptation while ignoring the parallels and the still-very-raw effects of the attacks on the city at the time. As others were removing any sight of the Twin Towers or possible reference to the attacks from their movies, including a scene from that Spidey flick, Lee was adding it, and \"25th Hour\" became one of the first such pictures to reflect on 9/11.Replacing McGuire, Norton was at the top of his craft back then, too--he'd have to have been to pull off the mirror monologue alone--and the cast overall is at least serviceable. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman was too good an actor to be wasted on these smaller, creepy pervert-type roles, of which he did a few, but I do wonder if his character's relationship with his student, as portrayed by Anna Paquin, in any way influenced Kenneth Lonergan's, also 9/11-themed and excellent \"Margaret\" (released in 2011, but made in 2005), which stars Paquin in another inappropriate relationship with one of her teachers.Even that monologue and even Lee's goofy-looking trademark double dolly shots couldn't take me out of this one. Next time I see the filmmaker indulge in all of his rambling and explicit excess, it should be remembered what he managed to do here.",

The movie is about his last day of freedom.There is both language and violence in this movie; all of it comes straight out of the plot.Spike Lee braids a number of narrative and physical strands together to make a powerful, honest, humane and troubling movie, well worth the time. Each actor in the movie depicts a person, not a 'type'; their strengths and their flaws are set against the horror and fear that was the portion of all New Yorkers the day the Twin Towers fell.New York itself, as seen through Lee's loving and unsentimental gaze, is one of the stars of the movie.I am a lot more sensitive to soundtracks that most of my fellow reviewers; in this case let me call out Terence Blanchard, whose score is big and powerful and apt. I was entertained to see he also did the soundtrack for Barbershop, one of my fave small movies.All the top parts are perfectly cast. When Tony Siragusa shows up as a Ukrainian mobster (he assumed at the time he was cast he'd be playing an Italian American mobster), those who recognize him will be amazed at what a great job he does, and those who don't will think he's one scary looking dude.Anna Paquin, now sexing it up with True Blood, plays a compleat vixen; Philip Seymour Hoffman her hapless high school teacher and one of Brogan's high school pals; Barry Pepper burns through a couple of layers of celluloid as Brogan's oldest friend; Rosario Dawson (who does \"Nice, Hot, Smart\" better than anybody) is wonderful to see, yet again, and Brian Cox is great as the dad. I quibble with his accent, but his performance had the nuance we've come to expect from this great actor.I call out Ondine Karady for the set decoration. I call out Tobey Maguire for buying the story and doing Spiderman instead so that Edward Norton, who was born to play this role, could do it. I call out David Benioff, who did a superlative script adaptation from his novel.Heartily recommended for when you are in the mood for a drama.",

            "content": "\"25th Hour\" is undoubtedly Spike Lee's most underrated motion picture. It is a purely character-driven drama filled with engaging and complex characters, dazzling performances and a mesmerizing screenplay. I was sincerely shocked not to see amongst the 250 highest rated movies on IMDb, as determined by user votes. Edward Norton delivers a flawless performance in one of his best roles up to date. Phillip Seymour Hoffman was also breath-taking as a Jewish schoolteacher who lusts after a 16 year old student. He plays the role of a lonely, average-looking guy, who's interestingly alienated from society with maximum precision. A good role played by Barry Pepper, a smooth-talking playboy who ends sleeping with a ton of women, despite the fact that he's harsh and not very likable. Pepper is given a golden opportunity with a role with more priority than most of his other minor roles in previous films, such as \"The Green Mile\", \"Saving Private Ryan\" and more recently \"Flags of Our Fathers\". As for Brian Cox, despite him only being in the film for about twenty or thirty minutes, his appearances are very memorable, and his voice over is absolutely magnificent.The movie has a specific scene which created a lot of controversy amongst New Yorkers, when Monty (Norton), staring into a men's room mirror, launches into a relentness monologue with a profane tirade against his fellow New Yorkers. His rage is impressive: encompassing blacks, brutal police officers, gays, Osama bin Laden, the rich, the poor and every other ethnic or social type you can think of, all of them put down with ruthless precision. A powerful scene which most viewers will not be likely to forget!Spike Lee once again delves into the heart of New York City, with controversy, with his latest film. Breath-taking. 9/10",

            "content": "There is no doubt that Spike Lee is a very good director. Let's hope with this film he will reach a wider audience, although Mr. Lee's credentials are well known by the discerning fans of his work. Mr. Lee works here from a screenplay written by David Benioff, based on his own novel. This director's best asset is how well he guides his actors into giving memorable performances, as is the case in this one by the brilliant cast assembled for this movie.Spike Lee is never boring. He has a knack for goading his audience with themes and ideas uncommon in mainstream films. There is a very provocative sequence at the beginning of this film in which Monty Brogan, the Edward Norton character, spews venom at the audience in a form of a bigot's rap where all different ethnic groups are disparaged in one way or another. That's what's going on in Monty's mind and that's exactly what we get. It's the way Mr. Lee wants us to shock us with the prejudices from the soul of this man.Edward Norton is an actor that pours his soul into any appearance on screen. He never duplicates any other character. One can see what Monty is going through by just watching Mr Norton's face. Mr. Norton belongs to a rare breed of actors who must be a director's dream come true because you can bet he doesn't compromise at all. He can enhance any film just by being in it. He outdoes himself in this picture.Phillip Seymour Hoffman redeems himself here. He was under utilized in Punch Drunk Love. He is also an actor that's always a welcome addition to any film. His Jakob is someone we have known in one form or another, be it a teacher, a working colleague or maybe a school friend. He is very effective here.Barry Pepper, as Monty's best friend, is all energy, no doubt from his highly stressful job. He is a live wire waiting to explode. His anger is visible. Barry Pepper is another actor that is interesting to watch and he is perfectly cast as Frank. The other principals, Brian Cox, playing Monty's father, is a man that has failed his son in many ways, but now he's there for him in the hour of need. Rosario Dawson, as Naturelle, is also very effective. She's a beautiful presence in whatever films she's in. Ana Paquin has grown up into a rounded actress who is good in films and in the theater. No doubt this film owes a great deal to all the ones involved in it, but it shows there's an excellent director behind it all.",

            "content": "Edward Norton is often considered one of the greatest actors of the current time. I happen to agree with that statement, as his performance in Fight Club really made me appreciate him more. Now, in 25th Hour, a movie about the last day of drug dealer Monty Brogan, Norton puts in another top-notch acting job. It's adapted by David Benioff, from his novel, which, I have to say, is very odd. And, like movies such as The Green Mile (which was a direct and literal adaptation), it's very similar. It has the same things wrong with it as the book, but, also like the book, it's well written but doesn't go anywhere.Monty (Norton) deals heroin, but, as we find out in flashback form (there were a lot more in the novel, I didn't really think it would work well as a movie), he was caught and has one more day until he goes to Otisville Prison. He lives with his girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson). He spends one last night partying with his friends Frank Slattery (Barry Pepper), a high-strung, egotistical Wall Street guru, and Jakob Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman, in yet another sad-sack role), a high school English teacher who has the hots for a 17-year-old student, Mary (Anna Paquin). While Monty's out, he must find not only who turned him in, but who will still be with him after seven years.I learned one thing from this movie: hell has frozen over. It only got one nomination, a Golden Globe nomination for best music (it wasn't that great), while it deserved acting Oscars for actor and supporting actor. Norton is his usual self when he's acting up there-he really shows great comfort in his ability to play any role. He looked even better with his goatee. Even though I had heard about the movie of 25th Hour before I had read the book, I could only imagine Norton as this role. He probably won't be thought of by the Academy until he's been out of films for fifteen years, makes a comeback film, and winds a lifetime achievement award.But, where was this film going? When we find out who turned in Monty, it's put in such a nonchalant format that we don't really care. If it were something that had more of a twist to it, something that added that little `bam' to the fondue, then it would have been more interesting. Also, everything led up to what? What did the two hours of finding out about Montgomery Brogan's last day have to do with what happened at the end? Of course it's development, but did it really lead up to an interesting denouncement? The ending was open-ended, like in the novel, and that's ok. However, I do wish we would have known which path the car went down, or some hints. I do have a guess, but there's really no way of figuring it out. One last point that I thought was unnecessary was the role of Brian Cox. He plays Monty's father, and does a good job of hiding his accent, as he does in most of his movies. Cox is a great actor, but was he needed in about two scenes?I did think it was interesting the way the evening went out, and, as I was reading the book, I didn't know what was going to happen. The subplot between Jakob and Mary (albeit unnecessary) was unpredictable, and it conveyed emotion. I really felt for the characters, especially for Monty. I do wish, however, I learned more about Kostya, Mary, and Uncle Nikolai, but the character that they brought towards us in the beginning were sufficient. The one scene that was most effective for me was the scene with Monty in the bathroom, and the mirror. He looks at himself insulting everything in post-9-11 New York, which is the setting. Why Spike Lee decided to make this a major point, I don't know, but it didn't really matter to me. As you're watching 25th Hour, you may think to yourself, `Where is this going?' You'll probably be too engaged in the life of Monty Brogan to care.My rating: 7/10Rated R for strong language and some violence.",

It doesn't preach, but there is definitely a \"do the crime and serve the time\" warning about it.Edward Norton as Monty Brogan shows us once again that he is one of the best of the actors working today. The title is a reference to his last day of freedom, scheduled to do some prison time as a result of an unwise choice of vocation. So the story revolves around him and the people in his life, his dad (Brian Cox), his two old friends, and his live-in girlfriend. It deals with the great inner anguish that an otherwise decent and intelligent person may go through in preparing for the inevitable horrors of prison time, where simple survival can be in question. A gripping movie, impossible to quit watching. On DVD, with two different commentary tracks worth listening to.SPOILERS follow. Having been dealing drugs, and hiding his stash and money in the sofa cushions, police show up with a warrant, and seem to know exactly where to look. Someone ratted on him, and at one point Monty wonders if it is his girlfriend, Naturelle (Rosario Dawson), but it turns out to be a bigger rat, outside his close circle.An interesting parallel story involves Monty's friend Jacob (Philip Seymore Hoffman) who is an unfulfilled writer who teaches high school. One of his students (Anna Paquin) encounters him at a night spot and, in a fit of desperation he kisses her, then realizes what he has done.Barry Pepper is his third friend, Frank, who is very hot-tempered. In a critical scene near the end, Monty gets Frank riled up enough to beat him badly, leaving cuts and bruises on his face. Monty hoped that entering prison that way would paint him as a tough guy and maybe he would be left alone.The ending has dad driving Monty out of New York, and Cox's voice-over talks about them driving west, Monty settling in a small town, getting a new name, sending for Naturelle after a couple of years, and ending with Monty as an old man with grown children plus grandchildren. But that was just a depiction of the dream of \"what could have been\". Monty, in spite of his crime, had some personal integrity, and serving his time was the only right thing he could do. The movie jumps back to the present, as they leave NYC, heading for the prison. (The writer and director confirm this on the DVD extras, there is no other correct interpretation.)",

Adapted from the novel by the author, David Benioff translated this character study. A drug dealer changes his life in 24 hours, realizing his past mistakes, seeking a self-redemption.Montgomery Brogan (Edward Norton), an Irish kid from Bay Ridge went to an academy on scholarship, where he began dealing pot to kids in the high school. A dream to live well, and own courtside seats at Madison Square Garden pushed Monty deeper into his criminal dealings. Caught in act by the DEA, Monty is sentenced to seven years.The film opens with Monty saving an injured, burned dog. Here in his last 24 hours, we learn that saving that dog is one of the only truly good things that Monty did in his spiral downward. In the present day, Monty takes a walk through those people important to him, his Father (Brian Cox), his girlfriend Naturalle (Rosario Dawson), and friends, English Teacher Jacob Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and hot shot Wall-Street player Frank Slattery (Barry Pepper).True in Spike Lee's style, there's a big story underneath the skin of this film. His theme in Do the Right Thing, was race relations between the left over Italians in a now predominately black community. 25th Hour is Lee's ode to the city, post-9/11. It is such a subtle tribute, that it is not in your face, but you can see, the people have changed because of the tragedy. In a memorable scene, the camera cranes slightly above Hoffman and Pepper, revealing the clean-up of Ground Zero below, and the icing on the cake, the magnificent score by Terence Blanchard.The film is polished, and to paraphrase a quote Spike Lee used himself in an interview for his upcoming Inside Man, Kurosawa, at 85, said there was still a lot he needed to learn about making films.

If Edward Norton is overwhelming, the supporting cast nearly upstages him, and director Lee shines with rarely-seen humanity, maturity and epic sensibility. And you shall be wrong if you think this movie is its main plot. That's just a pretext. After reading a comment on Empire magazine that helped clear things up, I understood finally the real intentions of this work: a depiction of the traumatized post-9/11 America. Actually, Norton (the USA) lives under the weight of a past without a notion of the consequences of his acts, and now, when he is in the verge of paying for his errors, he can no longer blame his girfriend (the third world) and lets his soviet ex-allies (failing superpower) to fight amongst themselves, while being advised by his closest friends: a teacher (cultural heritage), a yuppie (economic power) and his irish father (the hands that built america). On the final reel, the american dream is scrutinized bit by bit, piece by piece, model by model. But it is only a dream - the final shot is one of Edward Norton living his reality: a reality made of near-breakdown, sodomy and suicide thoughts. That's the post-september eleven USA. Its plot (which is just an excuse), may be considered superfluous, but the gut feeling of being grabbed by a movie (specially in that disco scene) is only achieved when the filmic sense is strong. And Spike Lee knows very well which buttons to push in order to leave the audience gaping in awe, aided by Rodrigo Prieto's magnificent cinematography and Terence Blanchard's powerful score. After the dreamy basketball poem of \"He Got Game\" and the visceral social study of \"Summer of Sam\", Spike Lee suceeds again and establishes himself as one of the key filmmakers of our time.",

The acting was great but what did seeing Barry Pepper at work add to the main gist of the movie. Nothing. What did the scenes with Hoffman and Paquin add to the movie. Nothing. Neither had anything to do with Norton's last day. Not only did they not contribute to the movie, they were not resolved in the end.\nDespite the tag line, Norton's character does nothing but walk around. He has an interesting scene in the bath room that is audacious but totally out of place in the movie. Why was that little racist diatribe necessary?The scene transitions are not smooth. One minute he is here, the next in a flashback but you aren't sure if it is a flashback until the end. There is more character development in the supporting characters than in the lead. I never felt like I knew him, his life, how he felt (other than he is a racist who apparently hides it very well), etc. the movie never made me care.Despite a great opening scene and wonderful acting by a wonderful cast, the movie failed to deliver anything but frustration and boredom.",

The final result is a long , tedious mess of depressing scenes and dialogue. Nothing thought provoking or cerebral at all. A man has regrets about dealing drugs but most of all, getting arrested. The club scene was especially boring. I wonder what made this script appealing to Spike(you know, the man who invented his name & the word). Must have been the racial diatribe spewed by Norton while looking in the mirror. I'ts getting old Spike. Well he'll always be the critics darling for fear of going against the grain(See Quentin Tarantino). The movie was beautifilly shot with scenes of New York post 9/11. Ed Norton and Barry Pepper gave good performances given the material they had to work with. Basically , all style , no substance. Not unusual for Spike Lee. You're better off getting a nice coffee table book of NYC photographs. Probably more thought provoking and you won't forget about it right away.",

The 25th Hour is essentially about a convicted man's final day of freedom before he begins a seven year incarceration for selling drugs. The underlying theme of the film comes from the depression and anxiety many Americans and New Yorkers in particular were feeling about September Eleventh. The first few minutes of the film contain footage of the rubble and of the two large spotlights that were put in place of the fallen towers. The movie reunites the doomed man, Monty with two of his childhood friends for a final night on the town. During the course of the day Monty learns who he can trust and ultimately who betrayed him to begin with. He also learns to make peace with his life as well as the world. In the end as he is heading up to prison Monty looks out the window and sees the stereotype he hates until a bus pulls up and a small child smiles and waves at him and with that the hatred is released. Truly a beautiful film. I can't believe that Spike Lee is yet to win an Oscar. The rasicm in Hollywood is almost unbelievable. I'm tired of seeing Denzel and Morgan play homicide detectives.

            "content": "With too much time on my side, I've decided to scour through the list of films I have seen this past few months and take some time out to think about my favourite \"closing\" during this period. Then it struck me, the film with my favourite \"closing\" in this quarter(its Spike Lee's 25th Hour by the way), may well end up in my top10 by year's end...Not wanting to spoil it for those who haven't seen 25th Hour, I loved the elegiac openness of its ending. It was an unassuming, cryptic close. But for people who have seen 25th Hour, hope you will understand how my feelings for this great film was encapsulated by its hypnotically beautiful closing moments.For one, having felt so viscerally, the gnawing desperation, the latent fear and utter despair throughout his film, Brian Cox's sure handed voice-overs(in the end), was like a balm to my ears. The effortless evocation of his calm serenity awashes me with an inexplicable paternal warmth during that whole sequence. He had certainly pulled a sedating blanket of comfort all over me. Like hell would I now care for \"what happens next\"? With \"25th Hour\" (building on from countless others before), my admiration for Brian Cox is forever sealed. I for one think of him as one of the best character actor dotting the American cinematic landscape today.Okay, on with another person fully deserving of my praise, the director himself. Coincidently, I am fortunate enough to be one-two punched by Spike Lee's \"Do the right thing\" and this film, over the duration of a few days. There is something spellbinding, poetic and courageously visionary about his bravura brand of film making. We may not like Lee's views or antagonistic real life persona, but when he has something worthy to say, he will say it via his films. And say it he will, with such intelligence, such clarity, and such explosive persuasiveness, his undeniable film making talent and cinematic virtuosity is arguably unequalled amongst his peers.In addition, here is one director who understands how to control the mood/ feel and narrative flow of a picture, allowing us discerning movie lovers to savour its rich, layered texture like the best of aged fine wines out there. One other director who excels in this area is Mr Michael Mann(of 1999's Insider). By comparing the two together, Lee is IMHO, amongst the best film directors working in modern American cinema. As I'm very picky about the directors I love, Mr Spike Lee is still only amongst the film directors I admire at the moment. But if the \"greatness\" of his next film equals this one (i.e. 25th Hour), I will unreservedly slot him into my list of favourite film directors and slavishly worship his Wicca-enchanted effigy for all eternity(okay, gotta stop now....I'm starting to sound kinda fanboy creepy...:).",

            "content": "...It's a faithful adaptation by way of taking the time to extrapolate and portray (and sometimes betray) these characters on screen, the way they snap at each other like only old friends and lovers can, the way they talk behind each others backs, but then have said back when the need arises.The source material's strengths (and script by a pre-Game of Thrones Benioff) are that the ramifications of the 25th hour are felt by all involved, and these characters are all of them culpable in their own ways, and corrupted, loveable, realistic, twisted and full of shades of grey. The dialogue is biting and lyrical, poignant and captures that real darkness. They accuse each other with the blinkers of themselves on.Edwards Norton sings, an understated but typically tremendous performance, in fact, every cast member is at the top of their game, Barry Pepper, such an underrated actor is a perfect asshole, Rosario Dawson plays young and old so well in this movie it's like two different people and the incomparable Philip Seymour Hoffman is sad and hilarious. By the morning they all look, walk and talk like haggard older men, out all night, they let themselves be ugly.Spike Lee has taken someone else's story and taken the state of his soul following 9/11 and he fused them into one story. Lee transposes his heartbreak, angst, pain and anger into this story, it's every bit his work as it is Benioff's book; not only was it cautionary and timely tale at the time, but its messages still resonate today. Spike Lee, a man who could describe New York City as \"his city\" made a film that reflected its shattered soul. When the camera frames Ground Zero out of focus for a conversation and then racks it into focus and Terence Blanchard's score swells, it's indelibly haunting and moving.That scene, yes that scene. The Mirror scene. It's a bravura piece of filmmaking, writing and of acting; The jarring poetry of it stirs a dual idea of blame culture (more relevant now even than it was after 9/11) and then when this scene is reflected at the end, the very human idea that it's the things you think you hate about something, is more often than not, were the reasons you maybe actually loved about it.During that scene and all over 25th Hour is the most soulful soundtrack I've ever heard; it's accusatory and soothing, it's almost constant throughout the film which is novel, and it seems to bleed a kind of unified pain; it has a sense of collective mourning, and the voices of the dead. It speaks for those that aren't there. It says the things that no one in the film does.And that ending. I won't say anything about it suffice to say that it's also such a bold commitment, doubling down on the real pain of that 25th hour; just as powerful as the slow-start and slow reveal of what this film is even about. Even though I've never been in Monty's situation, there's that feeling; missing time, missed opportunities, passing over to new life, changes you made but never knew would happen, something like that, that pervades this entire film and makes it completely relatable in some esoteric and deeply human way.25th Hour is my favourite Spike Lee movie. It has all of his hallmarks, his passions and his knowledge, but it's different, it's the New Yorker in him that made this film, not his race, it's a film that's more relevant than ever. It comes from deep within; when a person in this film embraces and the editing tries to snatch the same moment twice or three times, almost overlapping, you can palpably feel the characters try and snatch that moment back as if in protest to the shortness in time and amount of these moments left in their lives, or like the mind trying to remember the moments in the past that really mattered, when two people came together.",

That ridiculous scene where Edward Norton is looking at himself in the mirror is so laughable and out of place it is beyond belief. What that had to do with anything I can't figure out. The musical score is always too loud and too boring. He always cranks it up during one of his way too long conversations between 2 characters. The waste of talent in this movie is a sin.

When the dog snarls at him, Monty sees the dog still wants to live and decides instead to capture it and take it to the vet. The dog remains his companion throughout the film. The film benefits from fantastic performances and a director who knows what he's doing. I'll make an early prediction for another Oscar nomination for Norton, and Pepper might get one also. The film is basically very powerful and well told, and keeps you guessing right to the end.The film suffers from a fractured sense of time. By this I mean that the film will kick into a flashback all of a sudden and you have no feel for how long ago it was. Paquin's character is just a piece of luggage who lends herself to another problem with the film - running time. The film is too long in getting started and too long in wrapping itself up, and also has a habit of going off on tangents, i.e.: Hoffman's infatuation with Paquin. This subplot is unnecessary to begin with but does have a good, thoughtful resolution.All in all, the film is far from perfect, but Lee's style is as compelling as always, and the acting is spot on all around. Basically it is a good story well told, even if it is a little heavy on the seasoning in places. I also think most people will find the ending a mite frustrating.",

I did have a problem with that aspect of the film. Once I saw them coming \u2013 they're not hard to predict where he'll insert them \u2013 I knew I had to just bare through them to see what was otherwise a great film. I loved the direct-9/11 approach, the sharp dialogue, the performances and the tension between the rich characters, actors \u2013 always a huge fan of Phillip Seymour Hoffman \u2013 and although I am also a fan of Edward Norton, I really don't think this was his best work. In fact, he never showed his anguish to me, at least; he just consistently told us. Any great performance relies more on showing over telling. (Not to compare Norton to Keanu Reeves, but that's the best example of what not to do: Tell VS Show. Reeves continues to tell us his character on screen \u2013 FBI agent, Vampire hunter, The One, etc \u2013 but never do we feel his character.) Despite Norton's acting, you do get an excellent feeling of what it would be like for any one of us that was scheduled to go away to prison in 24 hours for seven years for drug trafficking. And there was a lot of tension in the film, never really letting us know what is going to happen, so there was a lot of great story telling in the film. I admit it was hard to put myself in Norton's shoes on what would I do or choose one of the three options he faced: suicide, flee or take the punishment. One of the twists in the movie has to do with who ratted out Norton to put him where he will be in the 25th hour.

            "content": "25TH HOURA Spike Lee joint Montgomery \"Monty\" Brogan (excellent Edward Norton) is a drug dealer who lives in New York with his beautiful girlfriend Naturelle \"Nat\" Riviera (Rosario Dawson). When the cops raid his home and find a kilo of cocaine hidden in his couch, he is given 24 hours of freedom before going to jail for the next seven years.Edward Norton truly is one of the greatest actors of our generation. Despite only having appeared in movies since '96 - his movie career is shorter than Jake Gyllenhaal's (!) - his relentless work and complete nailing of his characters in movie after movie, has turned him into the most promising actor of his generation. His work in 25TH HOUR is remarkable, perfectly showing Monty Brogan's cynical and stone cold nature through his acting. The peak of his work in this film has to be his monologue in the bathroom, where he basically lashes out on everyone, even himself.However, as flawless as Norton is, it is Philip Seymour Hoffman who steals the show as the quiet and almost sociopathic Jacob Elinsky, an aging school teacher who gets feelings for his 17-year old student Mary D'Annunzio (a gorgeous Anna Paquin). This subplot is even more interesting than Monty's story and it's almost a shame that it is so open-ended. Hoffman nails the character and truly shows what a chameleon he is. Compare his work in a film like Punch-Drunk Love to this - a completely different person! I cannot give enough praise to his performance.Spike Lee directs 25TH HOUR with style and focus, making it a thoroughly entertaining, engaging and intoxicating trip through the lives of Monty Brogan and his friends. Props must also go to the aforementioned Anna Paquin, who shows that she is more than great looks, and Brian Cox as Monty's caring father.Overall, 25TH HOUR is everything a movie should strive to be: An engaging story told at a great pace, with impeccable style, believable characters and a blazing soundtrack. If there are flaws in this film, I must fail to see them. 10 out of 10.",

But his movies have always evidenced considerable cinematic talent, as well as street-smartness, and this is a mostly absorbing movie, albeit one a little less deep than perhaps it thinks it is. Edward Norton and Barry Pepper in particular give fine performances, and Rosario Dawson is a very sexy leading female, although we learn everything we need to know about Philip Seymour Hoffman's character the moment he first appears on screen. Norton's character (a drug dealer enjoying his last day on bail before starting a sentence) is no Raskolnikov: his sense of guilt in entirely self-centred, and this could be seen as a weakness in the story: does he even deserve a happy ending? But the film finds true emotional power in the simple story of a man facing an ending, in this interesting and immaculately crafted tale.",

            "content": "Spike Lee's `25th Hour' is a monumental accomplishment that catapults the filmmaker right back into the pantheon of outstanding American directors. With his past few films, Lee - who seemed so cutting edge and promising a filmmaker a decade or so back \u0096 had started to make us wonder if, perhaps, we hadn't overestimated some of his talent.  But with `25th Hour,' the master has returned to form, fashioning a brilliant and thought-provoking character study out of David Benioff's novel, a chronicle of how a convicted drug dealer spends his last 24 hours of freedom before heading off to prison to serve a seven-year term.Montgomery Brogan is a good looking, generally pleasant-natured fellow who's made a lot of bad choices in his life and now finds himself having to pay the piper.  Although Monty is terrified of going to prison, he harbors no illusions about the fairness of the verdict.  He knows he screwed up and he feels no compulsion to squirm out of his punishment or to look for fall guys to take the blame for him.  Monty's offense is, indeed, a serious one \u0096 selling drugs to schoolchildren \u0096 and, much to their credit, Benioff and Lee do not ask us to shed tears for Monty's fate.  We are asked to care about Monty as a person, it's true, but not to approve of his actions.   Monty has chosen to spend this last day of freedom in the company of his lifelong buddies, Frank and Jakob, the former a high stakes player on Wall Street and the latter a high school English teacher.  Both men, who have taken widely differing paths in their own lives, still retain a spark of affection for Monty and even blame themselves to some extent for somehow letting Monty down at a time when they might still have been able to successfully intervene to help prevent the outcome they are all now facing.  In fact, much of the film is spent on self-recrimination, with various characters coming to terms with the painful reality of a situation that seems to have gone beyond anyone's ability to affect or control it.  The fourth member of the party is Monty's girlfriend, Naturelle, a woman deeply in love with the condemned man, who wishes he had gone straight before all this happened, yet who, during all the time she was with him, was not averse to enjoying what Monty's ill-gotten gains were able to buy for her.  All the characters, in fact, struggle with having to find that moral and ethical line over which they will not cross.  As the most `noble' person of the group, even Jakob, the schoolteacher, is confronted with having to make that choice and take that stand.  A lesser filmmaker would have used this plot setup as an excuse to fill up the screen with cheap melodramatics, screeching car chases, and endless dumb action sequences.  Lee, being an actual film artist, does none of that. Instead, he allows the scenes to play themselves out in a totally naturalistic manner so that we really come to know and understand these various characters, with all their unhappiness and sorrow.  It is a remarkably melancholy film, sad to the core, and Lee's beautifully controlled direction brings out that sadness.   His style perfectly complements the mood he is endeavoring to create.  The minimal cutting he employs within each individual scene allows the actors to establish connections with one another that would not be possible using a more razzle dazzle editing style.  The dialogue is so rich and evocative that Lee doesn't feel the need to intervene at every moment to remind us he is there. The result is that the film never feels the slightest bit phony, not even for a moment.  In fact, `25th Hour' is one of the most `honest' films to have come down the pike in a long long time.  Of course, adding to that sense of sadness is the fact that the events of 9/11 seem to forever hover in the air around the characters and their city.  There is a particularly remarkable scene in which Jakob and Frank discuss Monty's fate while sitting in front of Frank's apartment window \u0096 which just so happens to look directly down onto the rubble of Ground Zero.   It is a stunning moment in a film filled with stunning moments.Adding to the elegiac tone are Terence Blanchard's moody score and Rodrigo Prieto and Joe Williams' marvelously rich and beautiful cinematography, both of which reflect the contemplative nature of the characters on screen. There is some question as to the aptness of the fantasy coda Lee attaches to the end of the film.  It isn't so much that we object to the point it is trying to make but rather that the excessive length of it makes it feel somehow redundant and robs us of the sense of emotional fulfillment we need to experience at the film's conclusion.  That is, however, a minor quibble in a film as towering in effect and achievement as this one.  And besides, Lee's angry young man tirades, though they still rear their heads from time to time, are kept to a bare minimum in this work.Lee has gathered a brilliant ensemble cast to help flesh out his very real, very complex characters.  The superb Edward Norton demonstrates once again why he is in the forefront of the world's great film actors.  As Monty, he is, literally, incapable of hitting a single false note.  Norton conveys the innate goodness and charm of a man who is about to embark on a phase of his life for which he alone bears responsibility.  We can sense the regret, sadness and fear he is feeling in his every word, gesture and glance. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper do stand-up work as Monty's faithful pals, and Rosario Dawson shines with confident dignity as Monty's stalwart true love.  All four contribute immensely to the verisimilitude of the piece.`25 Hours' shows Spike Lee at the very peak of his form, a true master of his medium.  This latest work is not merely one of the very best films of 2002, but one of the very best works this gifted artist has yet provided us. Welcome back!",

It's about a guy's last hours before he will serve seven years in prison. I thought that the way they show the story is masterful. You get a picture of how the persons in the film are when they talk about things but still you have to think about it in your own mind. The acting by one of my favorite actors Edward Norton is perfect. He looks both like a nice man in his early 30's and also as he has another very frightening side. The film has many typical Spike Lee moments(for example when he talks to himself in the mirror, one of the best scenes in the movie) and I highly recommend this film. It says a lots of things that makes you think and it is a film that is also very nice acted. Even if the last 15 minutes gets far too much and you get a bit tired this is a very strong and well made movie about a(as in many of Lee's films)important subject. 9/10",

Not a New Yorker, and since I've never been, I'd love to know how New Yorkers view this film.Almost every scene is a visual work of art. He allows his scenes to run without quick cuts, which gives his actors the chance to flesh out solid characters.

There are millions just like him in New York City; people who live their lives in relative anonymity, but who lead honest, decent lives. There are more of them than there are scumbags; the much more interesting cinematic choice for most directors. There are honest bankers, honest cops, honest teachers, honest working-class people, but they are just boring; and no one would pay money to see a story about their lives. Lowlife films like this one require lowlife audiences to appreciate them. And yet, decent people watch these films as well, and wonder if they are the suckers that the film contends they are.

Although 25th Hour is no different the movie and as whole, and a quite inconsistent one at that, is confusing and rather psychizophrenic.  The side plots, all of which slightly revolve around Monty (Norton), are terribly confusing as to their points and are so dispearsed through out the film that they have no cohesion as a whole.  Every twenty minutes or so a scene leaving Monty out of the picture, usually involving Jacob (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) or Frank (Barry Pepper, in perhaps his best role yet) just appears and begins to tell a story.  Then two seconds after that the scene is over and your left with Monty sorting through all of his mental baggage, involving numerous flash backs that are easily mistake for some sort of hallucination - especially teamed with the fxck you scene in the bathroom.  The catch line of the film proved very inappropriate, Monty does nothing to change his life, he just moans about how he screwed it all up when he had everything. It seems to me that Monty didn't regret how he lived, just getting caught.  Though I appreciate the realism in that, it leaves a sour taste in my mouth because Lee struggled to make Monty such a fallen angel type of character and then just crapped out in the end. The B quality of the film is very disturbing for a number of reasons; including the fact that it is jam packed with wonderful acting.  Everyone that plays supporting roles in this film did a brilliant job, with out fail all the actors did a delightful job with the acting.  The post 9/11 mumbo jumbo may have seemed signifigant too some one from New York, and I don't mean this calously, but to bog down the film with almost five minutes of uncomfortable dialogue, and inserting an extra package of hatred towards 'towel-heads' as the film refers to Middle-Eastern peoples, was not only senseless but down right insulting.  The massive doses or racism that appear through out the film seem to scour New York's underbelly, a good example is again the fxck you scene, but somehow the list including whites, Hispanics, asians, and Ukranian peoples neglects any blacks.  Spike Lee has again proved to me that he is not worthy of the mantle he wears as a spokes person for African Americans in Hollywood.

There is a lot of revolt in this film, where some nuances and hints related to politics, morals and society are perceived. From this point of view, it is a film that surpasses the entertainment, that can make think. Perhaps the degree of complexity is too high for a movie that tries to be commercial, and there are parts and subplots of the film that I would honestly have eliminated to make the film less dense and lighter for the public less understood.In addition to Norton, the film features a good cast of actors, all at their best.

Never one to shy away from confronting a controversial subject head-on, director Spike Lee made 25th Hour, a story of young Irish-American drug dealer Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) celebrating his last day of freedom before he gets banged up for 7 years. Brogan serves as a metaphor for the post-9/11 America - unsure, paranoid, angry, disillusioned. In the first scene, we see him younger, happier, and saving a dying dog with his Russian friend Kostya (Tony Siragusa), but this was before he got busted, and, presumably, before 9/11.Lee is hardly subtle about his allegories, and the opening credits are shown over images of the beams of light shooting up in the air at Ground Zero, representing the fallen towers of the World Trade Centre. In another scene, Monty's two best friends Jacob (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Frank (Barry Pepper) discuss Monty's future once he gets out of prison. Frank's apartment overlooks Ground Zero, and Frank explains how nothing can ever be the same, both for their relationship with Monty, and for America. The presence of Ground Zero looms like some unshakeable ghost, almost serving as a character itself. Jacob and Frank's lives are hitting a sort-of midlife crisis also. Jacob is channelling his \"liberal guilt\" into sexually obsessing over a young student of his (Anna Paquin) and Jacob's Red Bull and stock market-fuelled existence is reaching breaking point.Of course, this being a Spike Lee 'joint' (how I wish he'd stop calling them that), the subject of race is never far away, and Lee confronts this in a standout scene that comes out of nowhere. Monty, after a dinner with his guilt-ridden father (Brian Cox), goes into the bathroom of his father's bar for his reflection to launch into a rant about his hatred for the many ethnic groups that reside in New York. \"F**k the Sikhs and Pakistanis bombing down the avenues in their decrepit cabs, f**k the Korean grocers, f**k the Russians and the Chassidim,\" he shouts. He also f***s the church, the Wall Street bankers and rich trophy wives. This is a man focusing his anger at anybody, and much like Lee's masterpiece Do the Right Thing (1989), the film manages to capture what many were feeling at the time.All allegories aside, 25th Hour holds it's own as a drama. There's no twist and turns or gunfights, and the only real tension comes from people's suspicions of Monty's girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson) being possibly the one who fingered Monty. But there's no need for it, as Lee's aim here is to create something all the more sombre and reflective. The cast are superb, especially Norton and Pepper, the latter proving that his talents have gone unrecognised for far too long with a performance of self-destructive narcissism. The social messages can be heavy-handed at times, and it goes on for far too long, but the ending provides an outstanding fantasy prologue of blind optimism.

And he is not arrested on the spot. So the whole film is a dream, the dream about the last day before going to prison during which the ex-drug-lord is meeting with his two childhood or teenage school buddies, one being a high school teacher and the other a stock exchange trader. Plus the father who is summoned into the film before that big event. The film thus starts with a beaten up dog the hero saves in some abandoned lot in New York and ends with this hero completely banged up by his own trading friend for him to be \"ugly\" and not to attract too much attention from his prison inmates to come on the following day, with details about how many teeth would get broken out of his mouth for his biting to be harmless, and a few other gritty details like this one. And just before this last picture of the banged-up hero in the passenger's seat of his father's car being driven by his own father to his prison, the dream of an escape, like in \"The Last Temptation of Christ\": go west, disappear, change identity, bring your girl friend and raise a family. Martin Scorsese revisited. But what comes out of the film? Are we supposed to cry for a drug-lord who has sold poison on the street of New York? Are we supposed to cry for his fink of a friend who just played his own game and lost? Are we supposed to cry for a girl friend who enjoyed easy money and luxury for years and is going to lose it all, if she does? Are we supposed to cry for the high school teacher who kisses his 17 year old student in a night club? Are we supposed to cry for the trader who gets redressed by his own boss because he is overspending and gambling more than trading? What is the object of the film, if any other than voyeuristic pathetic grossness? So in fine it is more disappointing even than disquieting, or disquieting about Spike Lee's movie making.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",

            "content": "I give this film the coveted fourth star. No joke people. Not Three and a half, but the full four. It is incredible. Spike Lee has always impressed me with his work. Some things bad, like She Hate Me, and some things good, like Mo' Better Blues, even some things epic like Malcolm X. I hold that this is his best work as of yet.The film itself is about Monty Brogan, a New York born and bred 31 year old drug dealer who gets busted by the DEA. Now as the film progresses you view the last 24 hours of Monty's life before he goes to prison to serve his seven year sentence. It is entwined with subplots about his two best friends and his girlfriend.Now the real beauty of the film lies in the fact that it is set against the backdrop of a post 9/11 New York. Complete with scenes of ground zero and of memorials of dead firemen. Now buried inside the intricate plot and subplots is something most people will miss while watching, this film serves as Spike Lee's homage to New York City. In the film we see our first images of Ground Zero in a film, the first film with images of the New York Skyline minus the towers. A bold move, but incredibly ARTISTIC in its portrayal. A real emotional ride for those of us who choose to remember.As I said before, I believe this is Spike's greatest film. I believe it is also his most artistic. The cinematography is outstanding. The shots of New York and the desert are incredible. The way the film is shot as Ed Norton narrates his \"hated\" new york and as he \"flees\" the city. The pan shots of all the 'characters' of this great play. Extraordinary.Aside from the film's directorial beauty, the acting is some of the best I've seen in my life. Edward Norton has always been excellent, American History X and the like, and his talent flares here as the main character in this drama. But even better than his performance is Barry Pepper. A man to avoid the limelight for years, albeit one of the more talented actors out there, Pepper explodes with emotion in this film. His acting skills are proved in this film, especially the last scene he appears in. Phillip Seymour Hoffman makes an excellent supporting role as the out-of-place friend of Norton and Pepper. Rosario Dawson plays her role well as Monty's girlfriend. Even Anna Paquin is fun to watch in her role as the temptress student (especially as she is high as a kite off e at a club). On par to Pepper's extraordinary acting is the hugely talented Brian Cox. Playing Monty's father, who is wallowing in self loathing for most of the film, makes a monologue that can make a man cry.Overall: The film is a must see. I can't put that any other way.",

One is doing his time, the second, committing suicide, and the third, taking off and becoming a fugitive. His best friends from high school are there to spend his last few hours contemplating his future. Jacob(Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a teacher and Frank(Barry Pepper) a Wall Street trader who along with Monty's girlfriend, Naturelle(Rosario Dawson) go to a night club and drink, while they all ponder the future with Monty away for the next seven years. What makes The 25th Hour work are the excellent performances by the four main characters. Norton is as good as he was in American History X, and his supporting cast are all superb. I could have done without the loud music during conversations at the club, but it is a minor complaint, as the script is well thought out. Also, I love Spike Lee's use of New York City as the backdrop. A bit too long at two hours and fifteen minutes, it is, nevertheless, worth your time.",

            "content": "Spike Lee directed this odd little film about a drug dealer (Edward Norton) trying to enjoy his last night of freedom before a 7 year stint in jail. The film traces his steps from girlfriend (Rosario Dawson) to father (Brian Cox) and his two best friends (Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper); a rambling, semi-episodic story about impossible second-chances and mis-directed guilt unfolds.The film overall seems to flow quickly considering the running time and lack of overt dramatic/action scenes. Other than the big flare-up between the 3 friends towards the climax, there isn't much here except a lot of talking in clubs and limos. Hoffman plays an embarrassed trust-fund schoolteacher with such a shrunken ego that he really seems like a man off the street. Barry Pepper's ego-driven caffeine/cocaine fueled stock trader character is practically an opposite but equally lifelike and compelling. Only Norton's character could I not relate to, and I wasn't sure if it was in the casual way he played it or just in the sense that I haven't known too many big-time drug dealers. Usually you wouldn't imagine them to be so gentle as his character, but maybe that's just a type. At any rate his was the one I didn't recognize from my life... but I've never lived in NYC.The montage close to the beginning of the movie where Norton's character spews out all the stereotypes known to modern man is impressive, especially when he turns the anger back on himself. The movie seems made up of waiting for these few big acting moments however, and the plots with Hoffman and an flirty student (Anna Paquin) and even Norton's relationship with Dawson seem fairly arbitrary. There's a mood of regret and anger that hangs over the whole film. I couldn't really figure out if this was why there were so many allusions to 9-11, or if that was all shoehorned in. I don't think the film as a whole really holds together. The big climax is just Norton getting beat up, and we already saw that in \"Fight Club.\" The corny \"escape\" dream sequence or whatever that was really underwhelmed. Can't say I hated the movie because it does have some strong performances, especially Hoffman and Pepper, but it's also lacking some vital ingredient that would have made it matter to me.",

And so the film is filled with layers, symbolism, messages and what have you. At its best, Lee makes great use of NYC post 9/11 and intertwines this with themes such as transnationalism and sorrow. At its worst, scenes linger on for too long and characters are unrealistic (the nerdy Seymour Hoffman and the cool Pepper & Norton as best buddies is a no go for me). All in all some bits are nice but in general the film really disappointed me.",

            "content": "Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) is a New York drug dealer who faces a seven-year prison sentence after he was betrayed and sold to the police. The only mystery being who betrayed him. The movie follows him on his last night before prison as he has a night on the town with his two childhood friends and his girlfriend.This is only the second Spike Lee movie I've ever seen, the first being Oldboy, and clearly I'm missing out on some great stuff here. Because this movie has style. It takes a relatively uncommon scenario, which most crime stories don't really focus on, and fills it with longing, depth, melancholy, foolish hope, anguish and bared feelings. Monty is not an innocent man. He really did commit all his crimes and deserves to go to a prison. Yet as we see him saying goodbyes, regretting the choices that led him to this point, lashing out and saying sorry, we feel for him. We can see ourselves in his circle of friends, see the same dynamics at play around which our social lives revolve. And when Monty at the end of his rope dreams of a brighter future, we want to give it to him, even though he doesn't deserve it.Style is one thing, but the acting is also superb. Edward Norton is just about the perfect actor to pull off this role, which requires both sensitivity and a mean attitude towards life. Not to say the rest of the main cast aren't great either. Rosario Dawson as the girlfriend Naturelle is especially noteworthy. Her character helps us realize that Monty has to have his redeeming sides as well. No way he could keep a girl like that if he didn't.25th Hour was a pleasant surprise in all the ways. A drama film with crime undertones that takes an unlikeable character and through the magic of storytelling, makes us love him. Definitely recommended.",

This is my personal favourite performance from Ed Norton as you get to see & feel his fear of the ever looming Prison sentence that he fears will be the end of him once inside.Now my favourite performance in this excellent movie is actually from Monty's close friend Frank Slaughtery, a truly incredible performance from the underrated Barry Pepper, this guy can act & here he shows all the raw & real emotion a guy would have for his childhood friend getting sent away for a long time, Pepper makes frank a cocky bachelor who feels guilty for not trying to stop Monty from his drug dealing life, it's a powerful piece of acting that leads Frank on an emotional journey over their last night together as much as it does for Monty!!!\nAlso another excellent performance as the other 3rd close friend of Monty's, the more geekier & timid Jacob played incredibly by the great Philip Seymour Hoffman R.I.P, he is fantastic as the idiot sort the group but also he's very vulnerable Shy & has no confidence but also makes some stupid mistakes, these are very richly detailed characters for these 3 incredible actors.Our small scale Crime Drama is about the friends \"Frank\" & \"Jacob\" taking Monty out for the night & giving him a great last night to remember before his long prison sentence & the three will probably never meet up again. The friendship is portrayed beautifully & very touching & very emotional at times, the Atmosphere is very tense as we know this night is leading up to a tragic end or is it?\nSpike Lee has Directed a Masterpiece in my opinion, a gripping & powerful Drama that I've watched many times,\nEach character is given so much screen time to shine & really show us these tragic characters & conflicted attitudes of the situation.\nIt's set over one night out in a Club & feelings are flying & emotions are high with intensity, also the Cinematography is absolutely stunning the whole way through as is the excellent moody & emotional music score, all elements are perfect.Also gotta add that this little character driven Drama is a time Capsule too as it was the first film shot in New York City after the tragic Twin towers disaster & you even see the ground zero site where the towers once stood out of \"Frank's\" (Pepper) posh apartment window, you get an atmosphere & sense of fear, dread & hopelessness with these scenes, New York City is grieving & the City is at a loss & Spike Lee has captured it on screen. It's powerful filmmaking.\nOther great roles are filled out by Rosario Dawson as Monty's girlfriend, Naturelle Riviera & Brian Cox as Monty's old dad James Brogan, also theres Anna Paquin as a student of timid teacher \"Jacob\" & each bring a little more power to the impactful Drama of the story.",

The film is definitely one of the most powerful i have seen in the last couple of years. It is amazing.The film also features one of my all time favourite scenes in cinema, which is the bathroom mirror scene where it shows Monty Brogan's(Edward Norton)hate to all the different people, races and cultures in New York from the local street basketball players to Osama Bin Laden to the people around him,including himself. That scene is cinema in the making i think. The other thing i love about this film is the ending! the fact that you never know whether Monty went to prison or started a fresh new life for himself and girlfriend Naturelle. All in all the master directing from Lee yet again, the pure acting and different story make this movie a complete gem. Well done Mr.Lee",

This is a long film and the screening I went to at least a dozen people walked out. Yet if you stay to the end I think the movie does, against all odds, justify itself as serious film-making. It follows the story of a trendy, high-profile drug dealer (played by Edward Norton) who gets caught and has just a few hours to come to terms with what he has done. His repentance is not very convincing ('if only I had put some money away when I had the chance' he tells his friend who is a Wall-Street investor). Yet the film makes some astute points by finally winning us emotionally in the face of intellectual bankruptcy. (I won't tell you how as it would spoil it).",

He is the bad guy with the heart at the right place and has some very good one-liners.There are two scenes which make this one the more-than-your-average drama.In the first Edward Norton is facing himself on a mirror (\"F*** you\" is written on it) and accuses in a kind of fascistic way New Yorks ethnical groups, but also the police and the politicians. In the end, he blames himself. This is done very well.The second one is the final scene. Nortons father tries to persuade his son to escape in the west. He tells him what to do. The pictures create a vision of Nortons future life, until he gets old with his children. This scene is not only very melodramatic and pathetic, but also somehow unsatisfying.

Although I have become annoyed with Anna Paquin and her typical and not becoming roles. Others in the movie never ceased to amaze though. I've always been a big fan of Brian Cox so I was happy for his small role, and the great importance it played later in the film. As much as I enjoyed everything the only part I really didn't like was the music. It was so extraordinarily heavy. It felt like I was watching a soap opera and not a Spike Lee film. It just didn't make sense. It would be very dramatic and over powering for most of the scenes that the music is featured in predominantly. Spike Lee may understand film making, but from this film he doesn't understand how to score a film effectively. The music tended to take away from scenes, making it feel like more of a build up for something that would happen when nothing was going to happen or nothing was happening. The music should've conveyed a deep emotional and subtle touch, not this hugely dramatic K-19 feel to the whole thing. I don't know, I'm a music major so this is obviously a peeve for me. I listen to movies about as much as I watch them. But for anyone who feels a bad score might underscore (no pun intended) your appreciation for a film I wouldn't recommend it from that standpoint. Although the acting is superb, and I thought the film came around well with the ending, and wrapping everything up.

It's interesting that here, with main characters that are not African-American, he covers the same issues of moral corruption, absence of ethics or human solidarity that he has treated in other films with ethnic concerns.

Story is about Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) who is a convicted drug dealer in New York City and he is one day away from being locked up for seven years. Monty has decided to spend his last night with his girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson) and his two childhood friends Frank (Barry Pepper) and Jacob (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and he wants to have a going away party at his favorite nightclub that is owned by the Russian mob. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Monty is worried that the head of the Russian mob will think they he will talk to the feds in exchange for a lighter sentence but he is more worried that Naturelle was the one that ratted him out. Jacob is a high school English teacher and has a crush on Mary (Anna Paquin) who is one of his students and she pops up at the nightclub that they are at. Monty is also worried about being raped in prison and ponders whether he should become a fugitive. This film is directed by Spike Lee but this is definitely not like his other films. One reason is that this story is from a novel and not one of Lee's own scripts but there are some of his trademarks that make the films final cut. One is the way that Lee patiently tells this story and allows the characters to really talk. This also appears to be a more mature effort from him and while I have been somewhat critical of his previous films I think this is one of his best films. Maybe the fact that he didn't write this script is one of the reasons but his direction is excellent here. Another thing that jumps out is the terrific cinematography that has been absent from his other films. Lee has the good fortune of having Rodrigo Prieto as his cinematographer and Prieto also shot \"Amores perros\", \"Frida\", \"8 Mile\" and \"21 Grams\". This is easily the best looking film that Lee has directed and the shot of Hoffman wandering around the nightclub in a daze is visually dazzling. One of the interesting things in the story is the correlation between Monty's jail sentence and the Enron scandal. Even though the film doesn't pretend to have something moral to say about this character it's still a script that has many aspects to it. We do see how this affects every character and this is the main point to the film. Norton isn't entirely believable as a drug dealer but his performance is still riveting and the best scene comes as he yells at himself in the mirror about life in general. I hope Lee continues to direct films such as this because this is a very good effort by him.",

What sets his 2002 feature apart from most of his others is that it can change your life. Many, many people say that about many, many films, but \"25th Hour\" is definitely one that deserves to be examined.Obviously, Spike Lee is a master of lighting, angles, movement and colours. Take the scene where Edward Norton and Barry Pepper are chatting above the dance floor at a nightclub. The colour of the light drenches them in blue, giving a cold feel. This is because both men know the end is near and there is no warmth left in their relationship. Also take the very beginning of Norton's day: the camera is positioned behind bars at the edge of the river, which gives the illusion that he he behind bars. That is the main aspect of the film.\"25th Hour\" stars Edward Norton. His performance in \"American History X\" is really his be all-end all with everything that follows coming in behind. While his performance as Monty Brogan in \"25th Hour\" isn't his number one, it is near the top. He is layered, strong, believable and glorious. Any other actor and this would be their peak.Monty is a drug dealer who gets pinched and is sentenced to seven years behind bars. He has one day of freedom to reflect on his life and to be with his loved ones. He hears that his girlfriend is the one that squealed on him, but Monty doesn't seem to be as mad as one might expect. What's the use in being mad? It was only a matter of time before a low-level dealer would get caught and put in jail.Monty's best friends are prep-school English teacher, Jacob (Hoffman) and stock broker, Frank (Pepper). They have loved him dearly their whole lives and don't want to face the fact that they will never see Monty again. Monty's sentence is less than a decade, but he will come out a changed man-not the same Monty they once knew. We meet a slew of other memorable characters including Jacob's neurotic student (Paquin.)\"25 Hour\" features two masterful scenes that are only in the mind of Monty. Near the end, Monty's dad (Cox) is driving him to jail where he says that he could possibly drive him out of state where Monty could start life anew. A beautiful scene that gives us hope is just something that plays in the mind of Monty and his father. Mr. Brogan just want his son to live and normal life. The portrait he paints is a five minute bit that could easily be its own short film. When it ends, we see that Monty just stays silent, indicating he does not want to leave the state. He may have learned his lesson, but he is not willing to take the easy way out. He doesn't like the idea of being behind bars for almost a decade, but he still needs penance for his sins.The other major scene happens much earlier and summarized what the whole movie is about. While at his dad's pub, Monty goes to the bathroom where he looks at himself in the mirror and trashes everyone he can think of. This film is set in the backdrop of 9/11, so it is only natural that he would feel some racial angst. Most of who Monty degrades don't even have anything to do with him. This montage is beautifully and powerfully conceived. It ends with Monty saying \"No. **** you!\" Monty is blaming everyone but himself, when it is actually only Monty that is in control of his own actions.So many immature people these days protest things and cause riots and blame others for their wrong doings. No, it is YOUR fault! You need to take the time to admit your own mistakes. Spike Lee's joint should make a great impression on you and make you reflect on your decisions.Here is a film of great importance that everyone can learn from.4/4",

            "content": "While a somewhat boring and unaffecting story on the surface, 25th hour feels like an obvious allegory.  Basically, Spike Lee has taken a story about a man who has finally been \"touched\" after a life of dealing drugs and grafted it onto the aftermath of the \"touching\" of the US on Sept 11.Edward Norton stares down his last day before being locked away in prison, and the film picks up right at the beginning of the day, the start of the aftermath.  We get a tone poem of anger and grief, the nature of blame and guilt, resilience and spirit...  some might take the symbols as American flag-waving, but I personally thought the film was actually a cry for levity, a cry against building business on the backs of others' suffering, a cry out for recognition of who's truly accountable, a cry out against the apparent \"responsible\" reaction to the eventual repercussions of those selfish practices, and a plea for a more sensible choice.  A choice that may be riskier, but is the only chance for a positive outcome.The film is an almost-epic, but it's maybe too much personal baggage heaped onto a story that wasn't meant to support it.",

Leaving but a few potential traitors, including his beloved girl Naturelle Rivera (Rosario Dawson), Monty tries his best to last the day without any lingering needs of vengeance, remorse or loose ends. Therefore he decides to spend his last day of freedom with his two friends - both coming from an alternative universe of everyday life. Frank Slaughtery (Barry Pepper) is a successful, but unscrupulous, Wall Street broker, whilst Jakob Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman) an orderly university professor with a strong affinity towards one of his students. Somewhere in the background he must also find a way to say goodbye to he father (played by Brian Cox), who dedicated his life to offering the best opportunities in life to his son.Apparently closely based on a same-titled novel (unfortunately not in my collection) Spike Lee films one of his most accomplished works, partly owed to a brilliant script by David Benioff, but mostly due to an adventurous and slick story-telling. Some exquisite travelling shots, which are truly inspirational (with special mention to the club scenes) and forceful storytelling (cudos to the denouement). Once again proving to me that Spike Lee works best when detached from racial issues, which cloud the moral backbone of his story, the renowned director manages to inflict emotional response, but not get caught up by the melancholic undertow. Slight touches do put in Lee's perception, like having a mixed race couple front the story (even now very often a Hollywood no-go zone) or delivering a crime story without any negative coloured characters. Throughout the movie tackles issues of failed dreams and aspirations from a deeply humanist perspective, letting strong characters interact and offering each person necessary focus. Monty copes with decisions made, first blaming the outside world and focusing on finding the person responsible for his betrayal, but soon comes to accept that his choices were his own and as such are also the consequences. The culmination comes with questions of choice - can you keep on running away from life and responsibility? Or maybe there is a point you have to stand your ground, even if it means bearing the burden?Fronted by a tour-de-force cast with Norton, Hoffman, Dawson, Pepper and Cox all giving it their all, making it a veritable gem, surprisingly low-key, but one that remains high on my re-watch list.",

From that point on, the guy spends much of his time on talking to his friends about it and trying to figure out if his girlfriend is the one who snitched him, given that she was the only one who knew he had drugs in the sofa. So, the movie centers in his last twenty four hours outside the jail, which is, in my point of view, original. But, what doesn't go completely right is the way director and editor build the scenes; there are some WEIRD takes that sometimes seems to have been put by mistake-- but I know it's a Spike Lee's thing. His way of storytelling isn't entertaining or engaging, leaving too much of his own impressions to \"complete\" the film, making decontextualised scenes, such as the criticisms to Bin Laden, homosexuals' seek for muscles, among others, that had NOTHING to do with the movie's purpose. It's not that it's a bad movie, don't get me wrong, but I believe a different director could have made a better job in this picture.",

The concept of watching a man the day before he has to report to prison for 7 years has a lot of potential.Unfortunately, the story moves very slowly.  If it actually ended up somewhere, I guess I missed it.Mr. Lee seemed torn between paying tribute to NYC and slamming it (along with every ethnic group and political persuasion therein).  At least he's equally offensive to everyone.  At some point, he seems to have been so intent on making a statement (not that I can figure out just what it is) that he forgot to make a MOVIE.On the bright side, I figured Tony Siragusa, horrible as an NFL commentator, would be laughable as an actor.  His turn as a low-level Russian mobster is actually not bad.  His accent is better than say, John Malkovich's in Knockaround Guys.I give it a 4.",

The Ed Norton mirror scene was vividly reminiscent of the most famous scene in \"Do the Right Thing,\" any many may have felt bludgeoned by \"Lee's\" political agenda. Additionally, many saw little connection between the plot and 9.11.Surprisingly, however, Lee does not have a writing credit for this film, and the mirror scene was contained in the original novel. I found this to be Lee's least socially preachy, yet morally engrossing film. The theme here is not black and white, but crime and punishment.  The three main characters all surrender to desire and all engage in degrees of morally reprehensible behavior, yet only one is being punished. Why? That's a question Lee allows us to ponder on our own. The connection to 9.11 is clear in my mind: some people sell drugs and get away with it, others get caught with a kilo in their couch, and others die when a jetliner is flown into their office building.  In other words, life is not fair, and consequences are not always appropriate.",

However there were some disappointing points that let this film stay among my personal collection of \"good but nothing more than that\" films. I think the film had a great story, with one flaw - the main character's job. Why should I care for a drug-dealer? What is he unique with, so that I could swallow and forget the fact that he sells drugs? Yes, we  all do mistakes and deserve a second chance, but I just could not care for the character, could not sympathize with him, nor the fact that he was what he was as a result of his childhood made any difference to me. Also I think that an intelligent film-maker as Spike Lee should know the difference between cheap propaganda and deep, insightful messages. But the American flag was in display in every second scene and in the end I felt that it robbed the story form its potent universal meaning and grounded the story In America, only.Monty's monologue in the bathroom of the bar where he was with his father was really strong, perhaps the strongest moment in the film. And the weakest for me was the the one in which the father envisioned his son's new future - or was it the son envisioning a different future for himself before waking up to reality?

I can't think of another recent movie that had such excellence in character development. Even the character of Edward Norton's dog was developed. On-the-scene New York photography was brilliantly complemented by a few cleverly conceived Hollywood sets.

What would you say?That is the premise for Spike Lee's (Do the Right Thing) new film The 25th Hour.  Ed Norton (Primal Fear) plays Monty, a drug dealer with 24 hours before having to report to authorities to begin serving his sentence. Helping him focus on the present rather than the imminent future are his two friends Frank and Jacob (played by Barry Pepper and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, respectively) and his live in girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson), who may or may not have turned him in for immigrant status.  The movie follows the group as they reminisce about old times, things that could have been and the bleak perspective that after seven years in prison, life outside the jail walls does not look any more promising. \nSpike Lee does a masterful job in asking all the right questions.  What does a con have to look forward to?  Who will hire them when they get out?  Will your friends still be there for you at the end of your term and just who are your friends anyways?  Each question is asked without preaching any answers and you end up leaving the viewing with great discussionary topics if you so choose. One question asked through a voice over at the beginning and conclusion of the film is, what will you miss. Early, Monty rants in front of a bathroom mirror about the state of New York.  Leaving no nationality untouched, he storms about Indians, Blacks, Italians etc.  How each of these stereotypes bug him in their own way.  However, in his final hour, Monty has come full circle and concludes how much he is going to miss the nationalities and all their obvious quirkiness.  It's Spike's way of showing bigotry then remorse with the \u0091Don't know what you've got till it's gone' philosophy.Part social commentary, part love story for the city of New York post 9/11, Spike keeps the films pace by keeping the audience thinking.  We never find out whether Naturelle turned him in, nor do we flash forward seven years to see if his friends are standing at the jailhouse gates waiting for him.  We are reminded throughout the film that Monty has three options; he can run, he can kill himself or he can do the time.  The movie is so interesting, that we don't spend too much time trying to figure out which option he might take, but rather, we soak in the speeches and commentary of the characters. \nAn elongated scene where Frank and Jacob speak about the forthcoming evening with the backdrop of the World Trade Center clean up out the apartment window, is one of the best Spike Lee moments in his young directing career. The fact that Spike kept the 9/11 story in the background as opposed to saturating us with images most of us soon want to forget is commendable and shows considerable restraint.The DVD comes with a few extras including deleted scenes and extended footage of the WTC workers sweeping up debris or large bulldozers and machines moving large pieces of metal into trucks.  I understood neither the meaning or the purpose for this footage as part of the special features, but then again, I am not the New York citizen or have the love for the city that Spike has.The 25th Hour was one of the best films of 2003, and I was surprised at how Spike was able to still include his racial indifferences into the film without making me feel like I was part of the choir.  Whereas he usually goes for the throat with his ethnic opinions, The 25th Hour still has us ask the same questions, but it comes from us questioning ourselves and how we would view our city is we were forced to say good-bye for a few years.

Does it give out some messages to ponder upon? Kinda. Monty chooses to take the consequence of his action, and Lee's trying to tell the life should go on even Monty's.Three endings were given by Frank. 1) Run away 2) Kill himself 3) Go to prison. Spike Lee uses some hoax to create this false tension, 'what would Monty do at the end?' First, the movie leans toward the answer number 2, Monty being depressed and talking about suicide and asking for one last favor that audience cannot hear at the moment or Nikolai, the boss, appearing and showing a gun right in the camera. When number two is out of the option, it nuances toward number 1, creating false daydream sequences at the end. However, it's just clear from the start when Monty saved dying Doyle who keeps struggling to survive so all his little technique or traps become useless and even foolish. Audience can predict the ending, and it is natural for a plot to be loose and audience to lose concentration. Then, something's got to be fixed, for example, the pace of the story, dynamic characters or dynamic relationships with a protagonist, or something. Plot is already so simple, and being slow adds up to enlarge the problem.Finally, it is supposed to be a feature film, right? Not music video. Every line, every scene has a background music, little over the top. To create certain atmosphere, the director can utilize so many components of the film such as lighting, camera angle, pace, costumes, setting, and etc. However, Lee solely relies on music, and audience is smart enough to catch that.",

While the events of September 11th are not really the main focus of the film, there are many scenes that devote attention strictly to those events and Osama bin Laden. In fact, there is even one scene where Edward Norton criticizes pretty much everyone un-American race that you find living on the streets of New York today. This is probably the film's best scene.In a film full of greatness, how do you pick out what is the best? Well, in this case, I picked that one scene because it caused laughter and conversation from pretty much everyone sitting in the theater with me. Well, things did not start out good for this film and I. First of all, when me and my two friends went in, the theater was so crowded that we could not find three seats directly in a row...this p***ed me off, because my two friends found two seats and took them. I had to sit next to some p**ck in a leather jacket who kept on coughing. This also meant that my friends kept the bucket of popcorn. So, trying to let all this go, I just watched. And after about a half hour, I forgot all about being upset about not getting any popcorn.The cast was stellar and everyone did a fantastic job. This is mainly the ultimate party people's movie. Director Spike Lee (who is usually very protective of black people) for once gives us a film that tells what every white American male thinks about society and all of the different cultures living in it. September 11th is a subplot, but it still causes a feeling of dread throughout.Many things in this film are delivered that other films have not had the balls to show. This is the movie for the party people! A movie for the people that know how to have a good time! A movie for the cool people in today's society! Okay, maybe I'm getting a little carried away, but this is the kind of stuff that crowds have been dying to eat up. You thought SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER, AND UNCUT was bad? You thought that film was racist? Spike Lee's biggest and baddest joint, 25TH HOUR is the film with the most balls that I have seen all year! While I felt that the very end was a little disappointing, and I did not like the way Anna Paquin's character just disappears without a last scene, I still found this film to be enthralling.

In that respect it's a bit of a melodrama but a high class one due to the great cast and idiosyncratic direction. The one bum note was PSH's character who seems to be a bit pointless. I don't know if that's how the part is written but he sucks the life out of every scene he's in, like he is only there for other characters to articulate their thoughts, emotions and fears to.",

Noone knows! He screamed he had no choice when Monty was given the chance to pay him back, but why he didnt have any choice we never find out. Naturelle had more reasons to but if you think that this was a moment of selfreflection it wasnt . It was all just a mess. If you think this movie gave you a reason to think it dodnt it just makes you cringe.Some scenes are so wird I had to fastforward, like the floating in the air by Mary and her professor for zero reason. Some call it subplots, I judt call it a laughing matter. I dont know what this film wanted to bring out beside making me cry and feel angry cause poor baby doyle was left behind hurt and broken on the streets to die! And I was so happy Monty saved him and took him home and he said he rescuing doyle was the best thing he ever did in his life. I agree! This broke my heart and made me feel so sad and was also one reason I wanted to watch to see Doyle again living a good life. But that svene was unnecessary and brutal.I find myself in the end thinking what did I watch , why! And what actually happend here in the end. Did they drive off to the desert or di they not. When we get no kind of explanstion pr solution to anything for 2 hours I imagined we will get it in the end but no, I was left hanging in the air pushing myself to think just to come to the conclusion that \"what does it even matter?\"\nWell It doesnt and it sure as hell did not.",

In terms of character development, it doesn't get much better than this.  Like reading a good novel, Lee unveils inner truths and executes tiny climaxes in slow and meaningful arcs, the real motivations and emotions peeling away like the layers of an onion.  But there are also many \"film\" aspects to admire.  Beautiful shots of New York contrasted with gritty violence as well as the thoughtful use of sound and music add to the viewing experience.In the end Lee shows how the consequences of crime tear apart the fabric of society.  The aftermath of 9-11 is used as a perfect backdrop to show the damaged psyches and mixed emotions of New York as a whole and of the loved ones most affected by Monty's criminal actions.  Deeply moving, honest, brutal in some aspects while poetically subdued in others, \"25th Hour\" is a great film built on small details, quiet truths, and the core of human relationships with each other and with their environments.",

For a background, we see New York, still wounded after the September 11th attacks.  Spike Lee sets the tone with the opening credit sequence, showing the searchlights shining in the place of the World Trade Center, looking very much like the ghosts of the Twin Towers.  One standout performance came from Philip Seymour Hoffman, as a teacher lusting after an underage student, played by a body-art-bearing Anna Paquin.  Norton's bathroom mirror tirade is a true Spike Lee moment, reminding you just who is the director.  In the wake of the 9/11 sorrow, \"25th Hour\" offers a bittersweet look at how New Yorkers are coping, in Spike's own way.",

Norton plays a guy who has been convicted of drug crimes and he has to make the decision to either go turn himself in at the jail and serve his sentence or make a run for it and leave his family and old life behind.

So, I left it alone for a long time and then a reader of my blog\u2014a complete stranger\u2014requested I watch it and I did. That's right; I took a recommendation from a stranger before I listen to my old roommate. Anyway, I'm glad that reader intervened because I really enjoyed \"25th Hour.\" The story is simple but very effective. Director Spike Lee is even able to manage having a story that feels like it is constantly moving forward even when flashbacks come into play. Sometimes going backwards in a story can put the breaks on a film but this one never felt that way. Additionally, the drama the story offers is top notch and really made the film grab you and keep you intrigued.Finally, the performances and cast in this film is completely amazing! Right off the bat you have a group of actors who are known for being excellent performers so there was no doubt they were going to deliver but, as usual, they are all better than expected. They all made their characters feel authentic and each of them shared some real chemistry on screen.I had my doubts about \"25th Hour\" and it was off my radar since it came out but the film proved to be a great drama filled with interesting characters and a lot of great acting.Howdy!

Still, the rhapsodic direction (though annoyingly intermitted by occasional fanciful editing) permeates heavily voiced over allegory resting upon its people' s idiosyncrasies, hidden fears and untold pain.

With no end in sight, all we can do is hope that the justice system will take care of it and lock all of the offenders in prison. Drugs have corrupted the youth of the nation and turned them away from the right path; the path to maturity and adulthood. Drug dealers are viewed as very low life people who don't think about what they are doing. This film shows that this guy just got involved in the wrong business of making money.In Spike Lee's 25th Hour, we follow Monty Brogan (Edward Norton), a drug dealer who stayed in the game too long and now is facing a seven year prison sentence. He has one more day of freedom and then it is off to the big house. His girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson) is very heartbroken over the whole thing. For a while now, there has been a rumor going around that she was the one that snitched on Monty. Monty can't believe it...but what if? He puts that aside for the moment and decides to just enjoy his last night of freedom. His two best friends from his childhood decide to take him out for the evening. There is Frank Slattery (Barry Pepper), a Wall Street guru who is can tell what is going to happen next and make his bond trades accordingly. He also believes that he is what all women are looking for. Money, power, and the \"right equipment\". Monty's other buddy is Jacob Elinsky (Phillip Seymour Hoffman), a high school English teacher who is very intelligent, secretly admiring his junior English student Mary (Anna Paquin), and according to Frank is in the 62 percentile of men making him a little above average.Many thoughts plague Monty's mind. He has to make amends with his father (Brian Cox) and figure out what to do with his dog Doyle which he saved off a freeway. Monty's life is slowing coming to a halt as he is about to be put away for some time and he needs to get everything cleared away. The other issue is he wants to find out who is responsible for snitching on him. he only has 24 hours to decide whether or not to go to prison, run as far away from New York as possible, or end his life with one pull of the trigger.Spike Lee takes an incredible story by David Benioff (also wrote screenplay for Troy) and turns it into a masterpiece. Of course, it wouldn't be a 'Spike Lee Joint' without Lee's view on the world, more specifically New York City. The scene in the men's room at the restaurant with Monty talking to the mirror and giving his view of what he see's is very well done. It just expresses what he thinks of the city and the way he wants things. The recent 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in NYC is evident with dialogue referring to Osama Bin Ladin and even a view of Ground Zero from Frank's apartment.This isn't a movie about shouting out, 'This is what I think is right so listen up!'. It is a great story with great, in-depth characters. Monty is sort of a fading figure. A person with a great deal of power and confidence seems to fade away, but his over powering presence is still lingering. His friends Frank and Jacob are incredibly different. Frank is arrogant and thinks that he is on top of the world. He is a very devoted friend of Monty's and will do anything for his man. Jacob is very disturbed with the fact that he is infatuated with a 17 year old girl whom he thinks likes him back. All signs point to NO but he keeps thinking about it. The three mesh together to form a great bond, one that can't be broken...even by prison.25th Hour is a magnificent film about love, insecurity, greed, and family. Norton, Hoffman, Barry, Rosario, Paquin, and Cox give their best performances to bring this story to life. This is a very real and very emotionally driven story. 25th Hour is about one man's last day of freedom and he would give anything to redo all the ones before it. One day...one great movie...",

Spike Lee takes the already interesting premise a step farther, by subtly turning it into a biopic, providing a somber and intricate picture of an indisputably good man who went down the wrong path.The movie's other strong suit is the relationships focused on here between the people Norton spends his last night of freedom with: his loving father (Brian Cox), his two childhood friends (Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper), and his girlfriend (Rosario Dawson). His two friends, in particular, fit into the movie terrifically. Pepper plays a hotshot broker on Wallstreet who brings with him a cynical attitude and Hoffman plays a more quiet and reserved schoolteacher, who like Norton has trouble resisting temptation, in the form of an attractive student (Anna Paquin). The film is, overall, very compelling. Spike Lee's filmmaking trademarks, intelligence and politically-charged tones, are evident here in an unusual way. Lee tries to portray racial inequality, and while Norton's Monty Bergen is a blue-blooded American, he is harshly punished for making what is depicted here as an honest living, in the same way that many of his black counterparts deal with in the drug trade. Spike Lee's enemy here is the war on drugs, he makes a strong statement against it, and he uses a white character maybe to keep it from purely being a racially charged piece of propoganda.",

Best known for racially-focused incendiary films like Jungle Fever, Do the Right Thing (literally in this case)and the epic biopic Malcom X, Lee has been a strong, if not controversial voice for Black America in film.  Writing as well as directing, Lee has opted to focus on social commentaries closest to his people, exploring themes with ease and showing his knack for character-based films.  A Spike Lee film (Joint) was almost recognizable from a mile away, and this form, although almost necessary in context and definitely potent as Do the Right Thing proved, seemed slightly tired and did not able him to grow after a while.  After his late 80s-early 90s spur, Lee struggled to produce something worthwhile (besides the comic relief in Original Kings of Comedy which relied mostly on the comedians), trying his hand at uninspiring dramas, comedies and even the average thriller Summer of Sam.  This brings us to 2002, ten years after his last keeper, where Lee found the right script and the right frame of mind to deliver his best work to date.His thematic approach and character interactions are in top form, with this stationary, but heart-wrenching story which is explored against a post 9/11 New York backdrop.  What he adds to the plate here is a wizardry of strong images which adds incredible aesthetics to the film and vacillates between bringing the viewer right in the story and making him look at the beautiful shot from an outsider's point of view.The script is solid, the actors are great (your usual Edward Norton and Philip Seymour Hoffman, with an above par, intense Barry Pepper and  very good supporting roles by Brian Cox and Rosario Dawson), the cinematography powerful and the directing... the directing brilliant!!",

Edward Norton always comes across as a very decent actor but I have not come across his realized potential until this and American History X.

It has a stylish look as does most of Spike Lee's works along with Anna Paquin and Rosario Dawson looking their best ever. I felt the monologues were out of place and over the top too. The climax dream sequence is too stretched. But despite a couple of glitches, it is a great entertainer for it's premise without being too dark and gloomy which it could have easily been.",

Ever scene from the original script is morphed into some apocalyptic version of DO THE RIGHT THING.  The actors are directed to be the over-top, repetitive, and concerned only with the \"issue\" (for an example, watch Anna Paquin's behavior when arguing over a grade). But, what about character and motivation?  What about this guy going to prison?  Do you honestly think Monty would have a 5 minute inner-monologue about how he hates every single type of ethnicity in New York City before being shipped away?  Not to mention, poor Brian Cox.  I can't believe he was forced to do that part at the end.   TED'S GRADE With 30 minutes cut out: B- What I saw: C/C-",

He was so profoundly good in it, you want to cheer for him right where you're sitting. And need I say anything good about Phillip Seymore Hoffman?  Than man is brilliant.  He is such a talent (ironically a cast member from THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY), and I wish he could do so much more serious, dramatic work which he deserves. A great script, terrific directing (I especially like the no edit scenes, those are awesome.  It really proves how good the actors are who have to memorize their lines and act them out to a t.), and spectacular performances from all of the cast members.Basic Plot: Nortan is found guilty of possession and dealing of drugs and is sentenced to prison for seven years.  The night before his going away, his friends throw him a party for it.  His last night of freedom, of joy, love and really life.I give the movie a 9 out of 10.  It's one of the best movies to come out in so long, and it's one of those films you can actually call a film.  Not something cheap and waste less but a really good film.And that's my review.",

            "content": "This is a really well acted movie. Everybody turns in a performance that is worthy of some kind of artistic recognition. Edward Norton delivers as always, Phillip Seymour Hoffman is consistent as always, Anna Paquin plays her role well, Barry Pepper shows that he can extend his range and play a character with depth, Rosario Dawson is better here than in anything else that she's done and Brian Cox delivers one of the best monologues I have ever heard in a film. Spike Lee's direction isn't as intrusive as it has been in some of his earlier joints but in watching this, it's obvious that it's a Spike Lee movie. I thought the story of Monty Brogan was pretty good and Edward Norton was great in the title role. He delivers an explosive hate-filled monologue to himself in a bathroom mirror that to me, was the best part of the movie. It's reminiscent of the scene in \"Do the Right Thing\", where all the different characters riff on a different race group. Here, it's just Norton but he lets everyone have it! One might think that the monologue was put in there by Lee himself just to stir the pot a little but I read that the monologue was in the book that this was adapted from, which came as a bit of a surprise considering that it sounds like exactly the kind of thing you'd find in a Spike Lee movie. Even though I found certain storylines in the movie flopped around a little while I was watching it, I find that they fit well within the context of the film in retrospect. I thought the music by Terence Blanchard added a sense of life, especially in scenes related to September 11th. There's a scene where Barry Pepper and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are talking in Pepper's apartment, looking down at Ground Zero and it's one of the strongest scenes of the movie, punctuated by Blanchard's rising score. Even though I felt that the September 11th scenes did feel as if they were added almost as an afterthought, I'm glad that Lee had the good sense not to shy away from it and present them in a truthful, unblinking light. All in all, I think the movie is definitely worth seeing. I think it says a lot about what it's like to be not only a New Yorker in post-9/11 New York but also what it is to be a human being with everyday desires and regrets. I don't know if I'd wanna sit through it more than once as it is a bit long and sort of depressing but I definitely enjoyed the initial ride.RATING: ***1/2 out of *****.",

I'm not saying that Lee himself is racist but he makes sure that all who watch his films know that racism is out there. \nThis film is one of his best works I do believe.  Edward Norton is one of the best actors of our time.  When you watch one of his films he makes you believe his character.  As for Spike Lee films I do not usually think much of them but this one is a watcher.  The only other problem I had was that they tried to fit a lot of information and even though it was over 2 hours you did not fully understand what was happening with all the characters.  Sometimes it is hard enough to follow one character but in this film you are made to follow 5 people's lives with no real background and no real knowing of what happens to any of them.I would watch this film again b/c Edward Norton makes it worth watching.

There are so many superb performances in this film, it is extremely difficult to pinpoint one amazing actor among the lot.  Edward Norton, so good at creating believable moral men in modern times, walks a tightrope by not allowing his character nor the audience the ability to judge his veiled past.  Rosario Dawson gives the best performance thus far of her as yet brief and hopefully long and vibrant career.  Not to disregard her acting chops, but to watch Dawson in that silver dress is to steal the entire plot from this movie.  Just as breath-taking is the seamy triad of friendship amongst the characters played by Norton, Barry Pepper (equally marvelous in \"61\"), and perhaps the only contender with Norton for the \"best actor of this generation\" award -- Philip Seymour Hoffmann. Love between men through friendship has rarely been shown so tender, traumatic and true as Lee demands here.  Hoffman is so alive in his skin, able to extract his character's emotions and reveal then bare-assed to the screen. Another great performance from Brian Cox as Norton's beleaguered father -- Cox has had an amazing last five years, perhaps the best of his career!",

            "content": "I was fortunate enough to see 25th Hour, considering it is only showing in limited locations currently. However, this is one great film from director Spike Lee, whose directing credits include Summer of Sam, and Malcom X. Spike Lee is incredibly talented as a director and certainly gives a very raw look at society in his films. In particular Summer Of Sam, which shows several friends in an Italian neighborhood of New York City during the infamous summer of 1977 when the 'Son Of Sam' killer, David Burkowitz, was stalking the city.  25th Hour, which is by far different from Summer of Sam, still takes place in New York City post September 11, 2001. In fact, the opening credits of the film center around the search lights that were shot into the sky of New York City as a memorial to the fallen twin towers of the World Trade Center. What makes this film great is the raw feeling of it, and yet the sadness that one feels for it's main character, Monty played by Edward Norton (The Score, Red Dragon). The superb performances of a terrific cast must be pointed out, as well. Monty's two old friends from high school, Frank and Jakob played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman (The Talented Mr. Ripley, Red Dragon) and Barry Pepper (The Green Mile, We Were Soldiers), respectively. Monty's girlfriend Naturelle played by Rosario Dawson (Men In Black II, He Got Game). And, Monty's father, James Brogan played by Brian Cox (The Ring, The Bourne Identity). Another terrific performance was that of the young, talented, and beautiful Anna Paquin (X-Men, The Piano) who plays Frank's sexy seventeen year-old student, Mary, that Frank is becoming obsessed with. 25th Hour tells the story of Monty Brogan, a drug dealer who's made it rich in life and whose been caught and is off to prison for seven years. It's his last night of freedom and all he wants to do is spend time with his father, girlfriend and two close friends from high school. With the companionship of his dog, Doyle, who he saved from near death at the beginning of the film, Monty sets out on his last day of freedom, conflicted with regret for his mistakes and memories of happy times with his friends, family and girlfriend. But one thing Monty realizes and must come to terms with, after he gets out of prison, nothing will ever be the same. Seven years is a long time for anybody and people change. Also, what will Monty do career wise when he gets out of prison; he'll be in his late thirties and face it folks, former drug dealers/ex-cons don't really have the best job opportunities. Even with his friend Jakob, who promises that as soon as Monty gets out of prison, they will open a bar together, Monty knows that he and his friend will probably never open a business together. And perhaps, they will not see each other again. This film certainly has its humorous moments. Phillip Seymour Hoffman steals the show with his portrayal of Frank, the high school teacher obsessed with his seventeen year-old student, Mary, played by Anna Paquin. She obviously comes on to Frank at times during the film, but at one moment Frank takes that flirt of a student looking for a good grade in the class a little too seriously. Barry Pepper does a great job portraying Monty's other friend from high school, Jakob, now a stock broker with a reputation as a jerk, with a lot of self-admiration. This film has some disturbing moments. One scene in particular in which Monty goes into a restroom to wash his hands, he reads 'f*** you' written on a mirror. Monty looks at himself in the mirror as if having a conversation with himself, and he starts yelling at the mirror, saying `f*** you' and running down just about every social and ethnic group that exists in New York City, making them take the blame for his lot in life. As I noted above, the film takes place post September 11, 2001 in New York City, so there are the occasional scenes of ground zero, including a discussion between Frank and Jakob in Jakob's apartment which is downwind of the disaster area.25th Hour's screenplay was well written by the author of the best-selling book, David Benioff. And of course, Spike Lee does a great job directing the film. I admire the film's raw edge at times, with its over-exposure of certain shots, rough but realistic dialogue, and terrific performances. I'd also like to point out the film's score, which worked well in grabbing the eerie feeling of Manhattan after September 11, 2001. Also, for it's nice love theme and a score that really grabbed the feel of the film. The soundtrack alone, through it's score by Terrence Blanchard, who has scored such films as Summer Of Sam, Barbershop, and Original Sin, tells the story through music of this tale of a man who's life will never be the same after this day. Overall, it's one of the better movies that I have seen in a very long time. ***1/2",

In a movie that uses the backdrop of the Twin Tower tragedy to illustrate the tenacity of the human spirit to go on, Spike Lee doesn't hold back on crime and punishment.  Unlike the rather ambiguous ending of \"Do the Right Thing\", in this film, we have the replay of the temptation scene in \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" to powerfully connect all the dots in the lives of five very tormented people.  Regrets are many from the father (Brian Cox) who drank too much to support his kid to the drug dealer, Monty (exceptionally played by Edward Norton) who couldn't leave the table while he was ahead, to his girlfriend Naturelle (Corina Dawson) who benefited from all the riches without trying to stop the live of crime to the best friend, Frankie (Barry Pepper), who knew early on that things would end up badly.  Philip Seymour Hoffman as Jacob, gives a sterling performance as a school teacher secretly lusting his 'lolita' student (Anna Paquin).  Spike Lee doesn't hold anything back from the opinionated viewpoints of foreigners in New York City to the super-stud values of a single white male.  But everything revolves around Monty and the future that awaits him in prison the very next day.

Yep, that condemned guy has three routes to take, but only one to follow! Should we compare him to the injured dog he saved, letting him have another chance? Or are we to analyze his life as we study the history of the WTC towers? Director Spike spares little to create an angry white man in many unforgettable scenes in the film. Alas, his intent goes deeper... it's the New York's honest poor minority who will be the last to laugh. This film is steeped with Spike Lee's messages and will definitely bring smiles to those New Yorkers who have been the victims of racial slurs!\nEverything about this film is paved with a succession of mood settings, leaving me cold with questions at the end. Director Spike Lee does well with setting his viewers on a guessing game, letting them explore his use of metaphoric comparisons. One gets to understand the characters, their insecurities and intentions at a very nice pace. Perhaps, Lee's quest is to provoke the question whether people would `Do the Right Thing' when encountering turmoil! He does lead us to raise questions about friendship and loyalty when a man's fate is at its worse. And it does reject the idiom that `Silence is golden.'  At least, it seems to say that good advice tends to comer too late or fall on deaf ears.   An engaging film, no doubt, and a nice performance from Edward Norton and all the supporting cast!  And Norton's character is like a man facing an identity crisis, true to Robert Louis Stevenson's insight: \"that man is not truly one, but truly two. ` It's tough to figure out how this character, as intelligent. Promising, and charismatic, as he seems to appear, could fall astray. The development of Norton's character falls slightly short of making his fall from grace believable!   Themes of relationships, interactions, temptations, greed and guilt crowd every framework of this film, weaving and integrating past and present events, through subtle use of flashbacks, to provide a closer study of the characters and their purposes. Director Lee does well to entwine the lives of a small group of characters with the Monty character. But is it Lee's intention to let these few white folks represent his stereotypical view the New Yorker whites? And is Monty's mirror-reflection rap meant to speak for the stereotypical mentality of every angry, white loser who blames his ills upon every minority race?  Very debatable!This film looks at life in New York City's fast money-lanes, and within the era of 911, given the WTC blue lights beaming out to the night and the Ground Zero scenes. But am I to connect Monty's life to the history of the WTC towers?  Is Ground Zero the result of capitalist greed and blind rage that ultimately brings doom and guilt?  Or is the scene with Jake and Frank looking down at Ground Zero merely for subjecting the viewers to compare Monty's tragedy with the bleakness that's left of the towers? Does the building's 25 years of \"life\" have any significant association to the 25 hours of Monty's freedom? To insinuate that the WTC two towers are a personification of Monty's background would be ghastly insensitive.  Sure, the WTC may have been a powerful capitalistic symbol, but it was destroyed together with the lives of a multi-racial group of occupants.  The WTC towers were built to revitalize a seedy location, dominated by electronic stores. It raised New York's hope for a better future and restored confidence to lower Manhattan.  Monty, on the other hand, is a felon and his despair is the cause of his greed and crime.  Oh yes, New York City will rise again amidst the rubbles.  Monty won't and as his Frank says, `he's gone'!  The inclusion of the scene with Ground Zero is disturbing. However, I must admit the cinematography should be applauded.  It does strike an apocalyptic appeal! Anna Paquin as the class `Lolita-like' temptress is well acted. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper's performances are superb. Hey, watch out for a cameo appearance of NFL player Tony Siragusa! Brian Cox is exceptional in his father role. He is convincing in his performance as the father who is finally there to iron out his son's problems. Very touching! Director Lee sure does use his characters to stereotypically hammer at white obnoxious New Yorkers \u0096 all seeming in self-denial of their own flaws.  This film includes an interesting list of characters:  the potential achiever seduced by greed; the bored married man with his secret yearnings; the conceited Wall Street risk-taker with little regard for company policy; the liberal teenager with her wily ways to get her grades altered; the materialistic female socialite; and the sponging parent with blind love for his son!  With the Monty and Frank characters, Spike Lee seems to hint that the potentially secured individual could fall prey to his greed, while the deemed underachiever could succeed.  But ultimately, life goes on for the New York's minority races.  \nThe messages intended by this film are far from being straight forward as the film's character development lacks solidity. The wishful thinking of James Brogan at the end doesn't make it any easier to understand Monty's character. Could Mr. Brogan's words have fallen upon deaf ears?  This is certainly one movie that will pump up some controversial debates.",

This is a very underrated movie filled with great performances from Edward Norton, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper, Rosario Dawson, and Brian Cox. The story is compelling and Spike Lee does an awesome job of directing us to understand and sympathize for a man who chose the wrong path and now has to suffer the consequences for it. Every acted scene is beautiful but the most compelling scenes are one is in the bathroom. Edward Norton explodes internally with a monologue that reminded me of Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver. Another one is a long montage of Edward Norton and Brian Cox on a drive out into the wilderness. Both of these scenes are beautifully acted and are both very powerfully directed in my mind.",

            "content": "When it comes to making movies about a man's life throughout one day, usually they'd avoid any other subject matter. However, Spike Lee also injects in some memoirs of the 9.11 attacks. Set in New York, it's obvious that it'd be somewhere in the backdrop, but instead of choosing to ignore what happened Lee brings it in. 25th Hour is by all means a harsh film, and it doesn't back out. As Monty, Edward Norton adds in this sort of deep frustration yet sort of style to him that makes him likeable and cool yet at the same time he isn't too great of a guy. He screwed up and he did the wrong thing and now he's paying for it, but Monty still feels that somethings maybe aren't far. As Jake, Phillip Seymour Hoffman adds quite a bit of nervousness and doubts to the character, who has an interest in his 17 year old student, played by Ann Paquin. Also in support is Barry Pepper as a cruel and honest stock- broker and Brian Cox as Monty's loving Father. While the script and direction are excellent, there are these little annoying musical moments in the film that come up way too often and try to make it emotional. Also, towards the ending some characters change out of the blue which hurts it quite a bit. Otherwise though, there is some really sharp photography and some really neat settings (dance club). 25th Hour doesn't back away from it's sad and provactive plot or it's flawed but real characters. Definitely one of the greatest films of the year. 9.5/10",

I don't claim to be a legal expert, but I do know a fair bit how the legal system works. I'm pretty sure that once you are sentenced, you are taken into custody straight from the courtroom and not allowed some amount of time to go home and then drive yourself to prison. For me, this keeps the movie from being a notch better. But once you get past that, the movie is a good story of Monty spending one last night with his two life long friends played by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper. It's set in New York and there are many references to life after the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. I really enjoyed getting to know the characters and their story in this movie. *** (Out of 4)",

'25th hour' was a pleasure to watch in the form of lee's brilliance in capturing genuine emotion.The story follows a convicted drug dealer and his last hours before he is sentenced to prison for 7 years.While i will not lie, Edward Norton was most definitely another essential component for my interest in this film. Norton (imo) is quite easily one of the best actors of the 21st century, he seems to be able to embody characters of any type with the subtlest of differences and still capable of creating a sense of innocence and sympathy whether playing a nationalist or drug dealer.The film opens with a brilliant sequence that displays Norton talents in conveying a sense of innocence for the affection he establishes with a subordinate dog that creates a great sense of sympathy embedded in Norton character.Like most great directors, spike lee can represent characters emotions through the use of a visual forum in innovative fashion, for example the mirror sequence which brilliantly captures the human embedded emotion of blaming society rather than yourself for your sins and the sequence where lee uses bravado techniques such as music, pov shot and that 'psycho' inspired 'drifting' technique to capture the emotion of 'jacob' realization on what he has just done.The only problem that i found with the film was the undercurrent themes of 9/11 that seemed in a sense superfluous, hopefully with repeated viewings the political context will reveal itself to be more than just an inclusion.Overfall my first spike lee joint has been a pleasing watch.",

            "content": "First question: is it a cheap shot to use Sept. 11 backdrops in NYC for this film?  Maybe and maybe not.  There is a sense I think most people felt about loss even within celebrations after September 11, and maybe that permeates the story of the last free day of Monty Brogan.  However, they never really speak about it.  Meanwhile, it's great to see that Michael Mann's crew has now got TWO scores that everybody tries to emulate for years: Last of the Mohicans' theme for wild adventures, and The Insider for American tragedy (\"Sacrifice\".)\n    Second question: why did I leave this movie about a man going to prison for 7 years feeling good?  Possibly because no matter whether you think it loses its point, or narrative focus, it is a very NEW YORK film which I haven't seen in a good while.  The jibes about Jimmy's Bronx Cafe, Norton's fantastic monologue about f***ing the entire city, Naturelle and Monty's first conversation, it all feels very comforting.  I grew up in Riverdale, knew some of the neighborhoods talked about here, and certainly I know guys like Frank with sh**-eating grins and hard-knocks advice.  (By the way, great to know now that Barry Pepper can actually act!)     Third question: why has no one mentioned Clockers?  In comparison to Clockers' story about drug dealing in NYC, this film doesn't stand a chance. As a matter of fact, the fact that Monty sells drugs seems almost inconsequential.  He could have been a pimp, or a weapons trader, or what have you: it's just a cipher for a criminal life in general, and Spike could have done better.  Mekhi Pfifer's breakout performance in Clockers, along with Keitel and Delroy Lindo, far outweighs any of the work in this film.    Overall, the film's themes are weighty, but it's performed in a very casual style.  The performances, especially those of Pepper and Norton, are thoroughly engrossing: each of them is combined of equal parts rage and arrogance, but both have their arrogance deflated, ending up on that same bench overlooking the river contemplating their next step.      Spike Lee's films have always been more anthropology than plot.  Jungle Fever, probably his best film, goes the furthest in linking a number of characters to a specific moment in NY history.  If you like anthropology, you'll enjoy this movie.  Go for Mamet if you like twists and suspense. This is a study of character, place, and time, and in its own way, it's very incisive.  Spend two hours, one night in NY 2002, as one man surveys his surroundings before leaving.",

            "content": "In recent years I have found Spike Lee movies to be very frustrating. Fifty percent of each movie I really like, but then there's the remaining fifty percent that just infuriates me. It's not bad filmmaking; it's just unnecessary filmmaking. There is a lot of stuff in these films that doesn't further the story, that is preachy, and simply doesn't belong there. But the stuff that's good is really, really good, and I found The 25th Hour to be another example of that. Ed Norton plays small-time drug dealer Montgomery Brogan, who, after being arrested by the DEA, reevaluates his life in his last 24 hours before beginning a seven-year jail term. Interesting premise. Why then muddy it up with a commentary on September 11th that seems out of place, and kind of badly chosen? Exploring the relationship between Brogan and his two best friends, Jacob and Frank (Phillip Seymour-Hoffman and Barry Pepper) and how their friendship will change once Montgomery goes to jail would have been a great character drama. Instead Lee adds a September 11th angle that feels tacked on and doesn't add to the movie. Don't get me wrong, it probably comes from a very sincere place. Spike Lee makes incredible movies about New York and is passionate about the city and probably felt like he had to find a way to tell this story, but he ties the September 11th angle to Montgomery's story, and in the context of the whole movie I didn't really understand the connection. If we are supposed to infer that the life New York was changed by the terrorist attacks just as the life of Edward Norton's character was changed by getting arrested I think it is a weak comparison, and frankly, inappropriate. The dynamic between the three friends is great. I wanted more of that. Loose the September 11th stuff, some of the peripheral story lines and just tell me that story and it would have been a better movie. 25th Hour is classic Spike Lee, brilliant, fearless but at the same time troublesome.",

This movie had the potential of being better, but even in the rare occasion Lee gets it right, his movies are always missing something and this one misses by a much smaller margin then usual. It makes one wonder if Lee even directed this movie? It seems the only time we hear about Lee is when he's publicizing himself through criticizing the work of the real directors out there.

Fine, fair enough... and maybe the whole I-hate-everyone scene is only there to show us how in the end, he's actually going to miss all these smiling faces that he once hated. Fine, whatever, but it's awkwardly done. And many other things are confusing and annoying: - The Ukrainian friend \"had no choice\"... that's weak... so it means he or someone else had a motive to denounce Monty. Nothing about that. - Jake and the student: she puts his hands all over herself one minute and is in utter shock when he kisses her the next. End of story. We'll know nothing else. It becomes completely irrelevant. - The broker and his life at work: even more irrelevant. His chemistry with Jake is non- existent for such long time pals. - The editing is majorly botched. - Spike Lee, proud defender of Afro-American cinema gives lead roles to white people and small parts to black people. Just like most Hollywood directors... I wouldn't have expected that of him...... but what annoys me more than all that is the messed-up message of the movie: Basically, \"If you're a drug dealer, don't go to jail: recreate a home somewhere else. It will be tough but you can do it.\" In other words: \"Do not take responsibility for your actions\". Maybe this is not the way he meant it, but if I understood it that way (and if I did, it means a lot of other people probably did too), then the message wan't conveyed very well.That aside, I didn't mind the pacing at all.

I don't mind this, but what I get confused with is in 25th Hour he plays a heroin dealer (heroin socially known as the worse drug out there, Black Death to some.) So he is an advocate against smoking, but plays the charactor of a smack dealer. To me this is awfully contradicting and allows me to question his beliefs. I don't agree with him politically, but I think he is a great actor.

Some complain that it has nothing to do with the story \u0096 or it's poorly placed in the picture.  I can't think of a better place for it and feel the scene is placed there to do exactly what it does (for those who get it):  shock and disturb \u0096 a jolting dose of reality and Norton's delivery of this monologue is as pungent  as a Shakespearean soliloquy.  This was the first scene I felt the tears welling up in my eyes as I recognized myself \u0096 and everyone else in the world (yes, you over there). \nThe entire cast felt as though they'd been performing their roles onstage 8 shows a week, so perfect was the ensemble unity.   Lee touches on so many issues in the microcosm that is New York, but that microcosm becomes universal.  The penultimate ending was visionary, as it was meant to be, all dressed in white, bathed in dreamlike light.

He *does* seem to accurately capture the feeling of uneasiness and wariness in the city due to the terrorist attacks. Spike does a great job of capturing that very specific moment in time and moment in NYC. Then again, you can get an almost identical feeling from watching the wonderful Mike Binder film \"Reign Over Me\" that also captures that moment in time.",

I had previously watched \"American History X\" and loved it, therefore \"25th Hour\" was recommended to me. Not only because both of them feature great performances by Edward Norton, whom by now has a place in the list of my favorite actors, but also because of the subject dealt. Both movies share the topic of crime, how a character is involved and how he regrets of his doings, when its already too late.25th Hour introduces us to Monty (Norton), a drug dealer that even though has already been found guilty is left to turn himself to jail in the period of three days. Apart from the scary future destined to pretty boys in jail, as the own movies says, Monty needs to deal with the apparent fact that his girlfriend (Rosario Dawson) was the one who exposed him.Apart from this main story, the movie enriches itself with the appearances of Monty's longtime friends, Jacob (Phillip Seymour-Hoffman) and Frank (Barry Pepper). Even though their relationships have deteriorated since Monty got into the business, he still acknowledges them as his best friends. Specially to note is Hoffman's character, who is a teacher whom has fallen in love with one of his students (Anna Paquin). The movie deals on how the friends blame themselves on not trying too hard to keep their friend off the wrong track and how her girlfriend stopped trying to help after enjoying the economical benefits the business meant. Even though the movie is slow-paced, it features good acting, good cinematography and great dialogs. The movie does have some flaws, like some unclear flashbacks, some loose ends and the slow pace which might bore someone who wasn't caught by the first half hour of the film. Its not an essential movie, but if you happen to intercept it on cable TV or it happens to be on your video rental, then, I would suggest you watch it.",

I want that pretty pass that sets up a big drive to the basket (sorry, I'm watching the NBA All-Star game as I'm writing this). I want a three-course dinner + desert instead of just burgers. I want 'Prada' instead of 'Payless'.......... You get the idea.There's not much to really criticize in \"25th Hour\" (although I could've done without all the free-flowing 9/11 symbolism that in the context of this story seems completely out of place) but there's not much to write home about either.Edward Norton, quickly becoming my favourite American actor, is excellent again as Montgomery Brogan (named so, as his father informs us, because \"boy's late mother loved Montgomery Clift\") a drug dealer in his early thirties who after years of plying his trade has provided quite a charmed life for him and his girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson). Unfortunately, it all comes to an end one day when someone from his inner circle tips off the police and our hero is suddenly looking at a 7-year jail sentence. In addition we meet his two buddies since childhood: jerky hotshot stock broker Frank (Barry Pepper) and timid high school teacher Jakob (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) whom the director gives his own interesting vignette involving a 16-year-old student Mary (Anna Paquin). Along for the ride also is Kostya, Monty's drug dealing partner. He is played by a 400lb former gridiron-football player and a Super Bowl winner with Baltimore Ravens Tony Siragusa. So the trend of hiring hard-nosed sport figures in movies started by Guy Ritchie and Vinnie Jones in \"Lock, Stock....\" now gets its American version.Now, all of that is fine, dandy and probably better than 80% of the flicks playing in cineplexes across America, but Lee didn't say anything new. In fact, he thoroughly covered most of this stuff already in \"Summer of Sam\", \"Clockers\" etc.... On top of that, certain scenes are a straight transplant from his 1989 masterpiece \"Do the Right Thing\". Furthermore, the not so discreet homage to NYC and its 'fiber that holds it together' is pretty clumsy, forced and needless. Lee makes sure that we know Monty is Irish, Jakob - Jewish, Naturelle - Puerto Rican, Kostya - Ukrainian, Mary - Italian even if this info has absolutely no actual relevance to the story.Everything considered, Spike should really get out of his comfort zone as he's clearly running the risk of becoming another Woody Allen who puts out almost the same movie every year and hasn't had much original to convey since like 1980.",

            "content": "This is only the third film of Spike Lee's that I've seen from start to end, and the level of excellence displayed here makes me hungry to see his earlier (and from what I hear superior) set of work.  Mr. Lee's greatest talent that I've seen so far is his ability to affect an audience so well when building upon the framework of an essentially simple story.I am a big fan of Edward Norton's work, and he delivers a performance here to rival the well-deserved accolades he received from American History X. Supporting cast members deliver where needed as well.If this movie is missing anything, it's that the premise has too subtle of an introduction.  I knew what the basic story was before going into the film, and I was quite glad to know what was happening beforehand, because I would probably have been a bit lost without that.  Like I said before, the story is really simple, but the details are revealed in bits and pieces through the film that would make it hard to follow if you went in completely oblivious to the story.  Our main character is a drug dealer who gets busted and has 24 hours of freedom left to spend sorting out his life on the outside before he will disappear into a notoriously hellish prison for seven years.What makes this movie so effective is its refusal to pull any of its emotional punch.  The opening credits establish the time and place for the story by showing images of New York City that mark an unmistakable period in time.  No on-screen dates required.  I've heard that some found it gratuitous.  I found it to be a perfect collection of shots to establish the setting.  It is hard to not be moved by it, whether it is sadness, awe, or disgust that you feel.The director takes this a step further from there, exposing the most taboo of thoughts lurking in the heads of the characters in the movie.  There is a lot of hate in this film.  Spike brings all the hate full circle, however. He brings it back to the source.  The hate that these characters feel, it all begins inside them.  They hate themselves, some things they've done, and often things that they didn't do.  They mask it by projecting it onto any easy target around them.  But it never works, because these people can only lie to themselves for so long.Unfortunately, these introspective discoveries don't get to make the rounds to all the characters, which might make this feel like a more complete film. However, it would have also dragged things out, and that would be a shame to do to this surprisingly well-paced film.  Rarely do dramatic films flow so well.  This is due in large part to the decision to blend all dialog with the cinematography rather than giving each their own voice.  The best example of this shot would be the conversation in the apartment that overlooks Ground Zero.  Brilliant.Along with the skillful examination applied to hate, a sense of deep love lies lurking beneath the surface.  While some of the harshest words I've ever heard spew from these people, deep down you can feel that the darkest emotions on display here could not exist without a love that made them care so much in the first place.  This is real inner conflict, not the generic crap that TV soaps will spoon feed you.  I found it all mesmerizing.In the end, this movie feels like a love letter to America itself.  This is a land that can eat you alive or supply you with your greatest desires, and gives you the freedom to choose your path accordingly, but the can always punish you for the bad choices you make.  We are given a land of choice, but our ability to choose is also an ability to take ourselves down.  The message is that so long as we confront our choices and consequences, there is always a glimmer of hope, and a shot at redemption.The director, cast, and crew bring it all together here, and the results are harmonious.9 out of 10, just shy of greatness.",

            "content": "\"25th Hour\" is a very compelling and interesting movie to watch for several reasons, not the least of which are very good performances of each of the actors in this vignette of the last day of freedom for \"Monty\" (Ed Norton's character) before reporting to prison to serve a seven year term (for drug dealing in New York City).Many of the previous comments have focused on a few tangential issues, some of which can be addressed.  Standing on it's own, \"25th Hour\" is quite interesting for its \"insiders'\" views of New York City, where the characters live and work, and the storyline of what Monty does before heading off to the penitentiary, and the gruesome fate which may await him there.  There are two sub-plots: the issue of who actually turned Monty in to the DEA (Federal Drug Enforcement Administration)precipitating these events, and whether or not Monty will actually go through with reporting to prison for his sentence, or instead become a fugitive and disappear.As the movie takes place in contemporary New York City, references to the attack of September 11th, 2001, and the resulting destruction of the World Trade Center towers play a part in the story.  This seems very natural, and in no way exploitive of peoples' patriotism, or pandering to voyeurism. One of Monty's two close boyhood friends (from an Irish working-class neighborhood in Queens or Brooklyn), played by the sniper from \"Saving Private Ryan\", and the photojournalist from \"We Were Soldiers Once\" is now some sort of arbitrage trader in the Financial District, and lives downtown in the neighborhood of the WTC site. Lingering shots of the cleared out site are very germaine, particularly as, illustrating the feelings of many New Yorkers, he claims that he will not move because of the threat of \"dangerous dust\" and would stay even in the building next door was attacked.  This theme of New York resilience is central to the story.Another part of the film which has attracted a lot of attention is a sequence in his father's Staten Island bar, in which Monty's reflection in the men's room mirror launches a diatribe against the various ethnic and sterotypical groups of New York City.  Director Spike Lee still has some type of agenda here, and the very close similarity between this tirade, and the ethnic slurs voiced in much the same fashion during a segment of \"Do the Right Thing\" suggest that this has more to do with Mr. Lee's inner demons rather than advancing the story.Monty is shown as a \"nice guy\" but it is also made clear that he is responsible for his situation, though some responsibility is shared by those close to him who were aware of his profession, but benefitted from it indirectly, or just chose to ignore it.  A terrible beating administered to Monty near the film's end, encouraged by Monty himself, symbolizes his acceptance of his culpability.Philip S. Hoffman appears as Monty's other boyhood friend, reprising his role as the pudgy loser, in this case a trust-fund supported private school teacher coming dangerously close to acting on his inappropriate feelings of a 16 year-old female student. The Russian gangsters for whom Monty works as a distributer offer a sinister look into that dark corner of Brooklyn, and also remind us of the violence and death that lurk just beneath the veneer of the affable people, and the profitable world of those who sell drugs for a living (it has to come from somewhere...) There is no sermonizing and no excuse making as the last day winds down. There are one or two surprises to keep the pace interesting, and ultimately it is Monty who does the right thing.",

This is the difference between an Eric Bana (in \"The Hulk\") and Ed Norton, Norton can make the slow parts watchable because he pulls you into the movie. The story revolved around his last 24 hours before going to prison for drug dealing. It has it's slow patches, but the script was good, the dark humour funny (and not overdone), and the acting very good. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper were excellent as supporting actors, both playing close friends of Norton's character. Both were well developed through interesting conversations and time was put into establishing the characters so that their bigger roles later on would mean something. Rosario Dawson was fine and effective in her role as Norton's love interest, while Brian Cox as his father was very good in his brief appearances.

            "content": "The basic premise of \"25th Hour\" is \"How would you spend your last day of freedom?\". This is the dilemma facing Monty (the fantastic Edward Norton), a suave mid-level New York drug dealer who is 24 hours away from starting a seven-year prison term. Monty seems to have it all: a Manhattan townhouse to die for, stylish clothes, a vintage muscle car, A-list status at the chicest clubs, and a beautiful trophy girlfriend who actually seems to love him. But the clock is ticking and the film documents his progression around New York saying goodbye to the people and places that matter the most to him. Along the way he visits the private school where he was a basketball star, and the bar owned by his ex-firefighter father- who is only a couple of years sober from an addiction to the alcohol he now sells to others. He frets over who will take care of the stray dog that we see him rescue in one of the film's many flashbacks, and ponders exactly who ratted him out to the DEA (a question answered in one of the film's more wrenching scenes). The heart of the film takes place in the uber-sophisticated nightclub where Monty throws his goodbye party in the company of his closest friends (including an arrogant stockbroker, his Ukrainian enforcer, and a repressed schoolteacher) before taking the audience through the dawn hours right before he is to report at the gates of the penitentiary. That is, if he decides to turn up...One of the film's central themes is the impact of personal choices not only on the individual making them but also on the people to whom they are closest. Director Spike Lee does not flinch from allowing his characters to be as complicated as they need to be in order for this point to be made clear. Edward Norton portrays Monty as in many ways a rather decent man, who tries to protect those he cares about, and is terrified of the future he is facing. But it is also made clear in one of the opening scenes that he sold hard drugs (the exact type is unspecified) and was fully aware of the part he played in the downfall of others. The film offers no judgments, but does articulate the thesis that sometimes any possible choice will lead to a negative outcome, it's just a matter of what kind.In conclusion, this is a sharply-scripted and intelligent drama, that provides the uniformly excellent cast the opportunity to deliver lethally on-the-money performances. There are also some truly hilarious moments, particularly the monologue that Monty- in a moment of self-pity- delivers to his reflection in the mirror of a bar lavatory. If there were more films of this quality, it really would be a shame that there aren't more hours in the day. Recommended.",

Those movies had original moments and quotes. For instance, black on black violence as being like a `self cleaning oven' in Clockers.  This movie has some flashing of directorial brilliance.  Three scenes stand out as outstanding film technique.  The mirror scene was great.  It reminded me of Do the right Thing.  I have read some viewers posts about the film saying that the scene was out of place in the movie, but I loved it, and felt it was the best scene in the movie.  It is the inner thought of a human being.  The mirror is talking not the character, Montgomery Brogan, (played by Edward Norton). He is not actually speaking his thoughts but the mirror is.  It is a natural thing to have prejudice and racism, and the mirror is saying what a normal man does not say out loud.  Ironically I do not think of it really as racism after 9/11, but more of a validation that different religions, cultures, ethnic classes can live in the USA, not necessarily liking the other group. The thoughts of hate exist, but it is unenforceable in America.  There being so many different classes of people it is impossible to force the will of one group on another in America, as can be done in Islamic countries where the only religion is Islam, government is Islam, and anyone else non-Islam is outcast.   Another scene that, I thought was genius was when Monty makes one of his best friends beat him up, so he can look tough going into prison. He believes he is too good looking, and it would be a weakness preyed upon in prison.  Finally the ending of the movie Monty gets a vision (similar to Last Temptation of Christ), of what life will be like if he runs instead of going to prison.  When the vision is over you see Monty being driven by his dad to? Knowing Monty's character from the movie, I would guess to jail. During the movie Monty seemed to accept prison better than anyone else does. 7\\10",

When it comes - you'll know that the shape of your comfort zone depends entirely on the additional time you didn't knew you got, you might deserve.25th hour is an amazing film. I think it's a love story. And yes I know it is not a love story but I want to see it like that. It's an amazing love story I discovered very moving. Amazing shots, beautiful music and simplicity makes it even greater cinematography success. We are talking about Spike Lee. You don't expect to Die Hard - you expect to learn and experience. This film is - should be everyone's - 25th Hour.Enjoy, AJ",

            "content": "For a while there it seemed like Spike was slipping, but this beautiful picture set my mind at ease. Here Spike Lee proves himself not only as an innovative auteur, but also as a wonderful director of actors. Edward Norton and Phillip Seymour Hoffman give the same wonderful performances we've come to expect from them. The surprise comes from Barry Pepper who, for the first time I've seen, acts. And it's good acting! The story is a moving one that is told with skill. The music is terrific and the photography is very well done. The only real complaint I have with the picture is two sequences that seem to go on forever: the epilogue and the bathroom mirror \"f*ck you\" scene. Except for the film's slight excess baggage, 25TH HOUR is pretty much perfect. A wonderful film about New York that deserves a place of honor next to TAXI DRIVER and MANHATTAN.",

Spike Lee apparently.Although I could rave at length, let me restrict my comments to a single aspect that can serve as a microcosm for my miscontent. The sound track was profoundly dreadful.  Incessant, loud, irrelevant and distracting (I mean, how exactly is 09/11 and some vaguely Middle-Eastern chanting relevant to the plot?) are the only words I can manage.  Oh, along with misguidedly pretentious and inappropriately epic.  This film, in my opinion at least, should never have been conceptualized as anything other than a slice of life.  The music was so inappropriately Chariots of Fire I nearly gagged. We do get some token \"Brooklyn\" in a club somewhere along the line during the 24 hours mind you, but it just doesn't save it by that point.Enough said.  You get the idea.  My take?

            "content": "One man's redemption can very well be as much suffering to those around him. His pain and sorrow can inflict the most numbing force of pain to those who care most deeply for him. Monty Brogan's friends, and what's left of his family grieve heavily over his departure into a world where survival is all that matter, and sleep itself requires one eye open. Montgomery Brogan (Norton) is going away for seven years after dealing drugs to children, and profiting over there self inflicting addictions. In his last day as a freeman, he contemplates every ounce of his anger, his resentment, his regrets, and furthermore his redemption to find peace in himself. The very few people he can truly call his friends, Naturelle (Dawson), Frank (Pepper), and Jacob (Hoffman) all share their grief together in their long time friends last day, trying their best to enjoy their last 24 hours together holding in every feeling they have towards their friends foolishness to continue his so called profession. Monty's girl Naturelle feels a depressing alienation from the man who thinks he cannot trust her, Frank shuts in both the regret and the anger of losing his own friends mistakes, and Jacob suppresses his own issues of self doubt, in both his stance what their friendship still means, as well as his own personal issues of Romance. Director Spike Lee offers viewers a Joint unlike any other, brining in a team of ecstatic players. The films plot revolves mainly around the very last hours of Brogans last free day, we viewers witness the last things he faces, and the final decisions he takes to become at peace. A guy like Brogan is not an unlikable movie character. Yes he manipulated the misery others to get rich, and yes he got mixed in with the bad crowd of Russian mobsters, using their influence to be safe, up until the moment he got caught. No one knows how the cops caught up, leaving us to wonder who ratted him out. He doubts his girl could've done it, still yet wondering the possibilities of how it all ads up. Aside from focusing the film's overall tone to the pain of one person, Spike lee displays our own pain through the very focused depictions of ground zero, for this film takes only but a year after 9/11, the day America felt complete and utter panic. The Directors respect is admirable, and very well depicted with both the films music of the very drama the represents the character, Monty's sorrow. Betrayal can be very painful especially to the person who put a lot of trust in that other person. Monty's rat is revealed in the least likely fashion to be but a mere parasite of a friend named Koytsa. The very discovery itself leaves us viewers both surprised and relieved at the fact the traitor wasn't Naturelle. As the film draws its player to the final stage of the game, Monty say his final goodbye's, but no being offered one last opportunity to start over, at the suggestion of his father. It would be a start with great sacrifice, and secrecy, leaving all he had, never returning, and thus restarting with one final chance to be someone. It all sounds nice at the voice of Brian Coxes' narrative advice, only for it to remain a suggestion rather than a reality. \"25th Hour\" is more than just a minor drama of a man's final day of freedom. It signifies the very last chance he has to truly change himself. I'm not saying Norton's character is evil, or even an a-hole, but he sure feels more pain than he show to others, especially in that classic F you rant. Monty just details every specific person he hates, what he hates about them, and in the end who he's truly mad at, himself I was very impressed by the film's message of redemption, and the sorrow equally expressed by its cast members. Morton and Pepper were incredible in both their roles. Norton's over whelming grief leading his character to find more peace within himself as he accepts his conclusive fate. Pepper showed some true emotion, playing a character who despite the anger he has towards his damned friend, he also feels regret for not being there to help him when he could've, leaving their last moment as best friends marked by both bloodied knuckles, and uncontrollable tears. In fact I myself couldn't help but feel pity for the film's character Brogan, out of the very impression he made on viewers. He's not a bad man, just stupid, and stupid people often end up feeling the redemption necessary to correct their mistakes.",

The highlight of the film is definetly Edward Norton's absolutley riveting performance! Other good performances by Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper and Brian Cox. The movie, although very disturbing, actually is wildly entertaining. The only part of the movie I hated was the annoying D.E.A. agent who had an absolutley dreadful high nasley voice. I was very surprised Edward Norton didn't get nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance. But you never know, he may get nominated for an Academy Award ... but knowing the Academy, I wouldn't hold my breath. If you haven't already seen this movie, go see it now! Grade: A-",

The film, the first to be granted access to Ground Zero, got an excellent cast of actors in the likes of Phillip S.

The story has no relationship with 9/11, except for being in New York, but Spike Lee smartly showcases the acting talent he's assembled encompassing situation of Manhattan post 9/11 with its healing/grieving underlying metaphor perfectly balanced with its protagonist's certain unsteady future.

If you haven't seen Primal Fear, you should.  His character in this movie is similar to his in American History X, a movie I actually only saw recently. The monologue in this movie was great and so true, no I am not racist, but a lot of what he was saying was true in that monologue and also in American History X.  One was a little extreme view of the truth.  But either way this movie is good and also a little bit weird, especially the night club scene with Anna Paquin, Rogue from X-Men.  I gave this movie an 8 because some parts of it just didn't keep my interest all the way like the others did and it didn't really explain what happened at the end.

            "content": "Spike Lee's `25th Hour' has so many interesting qualities to it, both as a movie and as a sociological perspective of the director himself, that it's a shame the film's weaker elements keep it from being more profound. It's essentially a `portrait film', where it's more about painting interesting character profiles and seeing how they respond to situations, than it is about plot or character development. To Lee's credit, he not only painted clear, believable characters, but was additionally ambitious in his desire to profile a subculture outside of his own. But, the film's effectiveness in the end couldn't rely solely on the portraits he painted, despite how well they were done. It required more storytelling elements to breath life into the project.As for the portraits, the hero is Montgomery Brogan, played by Ed Norton, an unsuspecting drug dealer, who reevaluates his life in the 24 remaining hours before facing a seven-year jail term. Brogan is an Irish-Catholic with an upper-middle-class background \u0096 not exactly the kind of person one immediately thinks of when someone says, `drug dealer.' In his last hours, he reaches out to friends from years past, philosophizes with them about life, how he got where he is, and what kind of frightful future awaits him behind bars. The movie follows him throughout a day, and we watch as he finishes unfinished business, ties loose ends in his family life, and reaches out to those he considered to be his `best friends,' now that he's come to terms with his life.Where Lee takes his risk is by placing all his eggs in this one basket: portraits. There is enough plot to give characters reason for their self-examinations-but character development is essentially non-existent. That's ok, the goal of `portrait films' is to paint a still life picture that profiles a character so as to examine aspects of them in different life situations. Lee has always been good at character portrayals, but the departure here is the singular focus on nothing but portraiture. Indeed, he's begging audiences to evaluate not just the film, but Lee himself: what's his racial view of a subculture that's not his own? Is he making a political statement, airing his discontent, or genuinely interested in his characters by depicting them fairly and authentically. It's almost too obvious that Lee is keenly aware that we are aware of his branching out.As far as the portraits go, Lee's risk pays off. Norton's portrayal not only seems believable to us for what we do know about such characters, but we believe what we're told of what we don't know about them. That's hard to do, not just because gaining insight into others' cultures is hard, but if you do it well, you often bring upon yourself more controversy than if you'd done it poorly. A perfect example is the 1994 film, `Fresh', which depicted a very realistic black drug culture in New York and a young 11-year-old's struggle to escape it. The film gained notoriety, not just because of its shocking and disturbing authenticity, but because the writer/director was Jewish from a well-to-do background. By showing a subculture in less-than-flattering light, you're sure to get attacked as being racist or exploitive, especially if you're an outsider.Yet, despite Lee's seemingly accurate portrayal of his characters, he's going to be safe from controversy for a few reasons. First, unlike `Fresh', which had a compelling and disturbing plot line, `25th Hour' will likely leave many audience members looking at their watch, as the film does tend to go on for a while without much development. Here, Lee's existential commentaries could have either been pruned back a little, or given a wider array of ideas to consider.More importantly, none of the characters have an important enough purpose to each other. Their relationships don't contribute to a better insight into the existential questions Brogan asks or faces, nor do they have discussions of such ideas, beyond a few introductory observations. Their screen time is used solely to paint more detailed pictures of these people, but without a tighter connection between them in the storyline, it's like viewing a set of incongruent pictures in a gallery: they're fine as individual works, but where's the coherency? To make matters worse, the medium of film provides a wider canvas than portraiture, so you either have to fill the emptiness, or have characters punctuate through it. (In other words, give them meaning.)It's hard for me to pan `25th Hour' because its qualities are noteworthy and the performances are great. However, I resist more enthusiastic praise because Lee didn't take advantage of his opportunities for multi-dimensionality. He could have chosen to develop more aspects to the film without compromising its `portrait' quality, rendering it dryly forgettable in the end.",

And everything is there - fabulous acting, something than can be always expected from Edward Norton, but so many great supporting roles is amazing in one movie - I don't know who to mention first Philip Seymour Hoffman, Barry Pepper, Brian Cox, Rosario Dawson or Anna Paquin. All of them are wonderfully guided by the Spike Lee, who is giving us his unique approach and personal stamp, which is making the difference and that is what the masterpiece is all about. And all of that is perceivable in different stages of the movie - at the very beginning, with the scene that should be seen again after the end of the movie, with the slow waking introduction, great overview of main character view of the society and life in the given moment, over the \"last night\" with his friends, to the very down of the \"D\" day. Perhaps I can just object few time and mind swifts, but not as near to spoil the impression.

Where does one start on such a near flawless piece of art? The film begins with Norton occupying the screen and ends the same way. He embodies this character so totally, one forgets he is performing. The emotional honesty and integrity of all the performances leads me to term this an ensemble piece to many degrees. The interplay between Hoffman and Pepper in the Chinese restaurant scene sparkles with honesty and truth. Our introduction to Monty, Morton's character sees him visiting Hoffman's character in the high school where he teaches and where both went to school. The pathos of nostalgia simply oozes out of Norton effortlessly and without any hint of contrivance. The viewer is at once drawn in and captivated.Bienoff's screenplay is one of naturalistic integrity and beauty. He must be commended for it as should the actors for their delivery of, in my opinion, the best screenplay in recent years. Brian Cox proves his legendary status through his performance of Monty's torn and ex- alcoholic father. Norton is the lynch pin however. Even when he is off screen we anticipate his return and revel in his presence when he arrives. His portrayal warms us to Monty, he is essentially a nice guy who has dabbled in the dark side of life and is going to pay for it in a rather substantial way. We don't want him to leave in as much as his friends don't either. The film possesses one of the finest and original endings to grace a screen and does not fall prey to sentimentalism. This is an utterly compelling film. A master stroke by a master craftsman, Spike Lee. Well Done.",

            "content": "The 25th hour is a emotional and moving drama from spike lee,filled with brilliant performance of Edward Norton.A drug dealer(Montgomery brogan) has sentenced for seven years in jail.Before he went to jail,he has 24 hours of freedom to spend with his wife ,his father,his close friends and his dog.In this 24hours,they realize what went wrong and who was responsible.He was smart,young and intelligent but he did wrong things,at some point he moved towards wrong direction in his life.The 25th hour revolves around this 24 hours where everybody grieve ,think of the moments where they tried to stop him but he didn't listen to them.The movie deals with the relationships ,their importance and failure of them,what happens when we don't listen to them or when they fail to act.the movie shows it is only us who should be held responsible for our mistakes and its consequences.the reasons should be many but the main culprit is only us.The movie is also about fear which we felt through Monty,fear of not being survived and losing everything.Edward Norton was the perfect choice for the role of Monty borgan and he played it brilliantly.the character of Monty is not of a very bad guy but somehow he took wrong decision to become a drug dealer.the character was not very sympathetic and likable either but Edward Norton made us grew sympathy towards him.all other main characters were very well portrayed.his wife naturaily (rosarie Dawson) who failed to stop him from ruining himself,his father(Brian cox) who owns a pub and felt very estranged with his own son,and his friends Jacob Elinsky(Philip Hoffman) a introvert English teacher who has a crush for his own student and Frank Slaughtery(berry pepper) his child-hood friend who felt sorry for Monty but also believe that he deserved for what he did,they all seemed to be estranged and distant to each other.we felt the feelings of emotional estrangement and dissatisfaction among the characters for each other and spike lee succeeded in portraying those feelings.but in some way direction of the spike lee was not up to the mark as he did some mistakes.some scenes seemed to be very badly edited and proper use of camera should be done to make the scenes better.some small characters like DEA officers are very improperly portrayed.the movie was intense and involving but irregularly. there was no problem with script,it was brilliantly written,but movie left to make impact at many moments where they could have done better due to its weak supervision.however,they give brilliant start and finish to the movie.the opening scene of the movie shows Monty saving the injured dog as he was inspired by his zeal to live.after wards,Monty admits to his friend that saving this dog is the only good thing he did in his life,which makes us realize how unimportant life he had lived.after the starting when i felt movie is getting more involving and interesting the movie deviated from its path at certain points due to its weak supervision by spike lee.the best part of the movie was the montage at the ending, which shows his father taking him farther away from new york instead of going to jail,his father saying how it is possible that he can live happily away from here,then we saw Monty living a happy life, getting married with naturaily and raising kids.but at last when montage ends we saw both of them going towards jail ,realizing us of loss of last opportunity he had to save everything he lost.spike lee chosen the great idea to make the movie but he failed to convert it into something memorable,but this doesn't prevent movie to deliver its message successfully.the movie reminded me of movie cool hand Luke,symbolically,the hero also had its poster in his house.both movies are the character study of anti-hero who did mistakes in their life,and ended up in jail,having no idea what to do with life.",

Production and cinematography is as you've come to expect from Lee and does the subject matter justice as the characters all move toward the climax through various confronting episodes along the way. There's a fantastic cast in this movie and it really shows in the finished product. It felt like a while between drinks for Spike Lee but it was worth the wait when i watched this.

A story of three childhood friends who over the years have moved in completely different directions but with a crisis facing one of them, they come together as supportive companions. The movie shows New York through the ideas of the condemned man as he scans an exhibition of fellow New Yorkers through his vivid imagaination and frustration with himself. This is truly an original and surreal view of the world around him which includes his view of his own failings. The language is raw and angry but it actually enhances the story which is filled with frustration and despair. The cinematography and the music never intrude yet they too heighten the movie to its climatic ending.",

            "content": "Spike Lee is possibly the boldest film-maker alive today. His films take place in the real world, not on some hollywood set. Most movies that take place in New York right now, take place in a New York that never experienced tragedy, they completly forget about what happened on 9/11. Spike Lee's New York of 25th hour is not only a New York where 9/11 happened, he doesn't just show ground zero briefly or have a character make one reference to it, it is a New York where everyone in it is saddened and angered and rudley awakened after it happened. But, this isn't a documentry on 9/11 either, the plot is about Monty Brogan going off to prison for seven years and reflecting on his mistakes (in some cases) and trying to cope with his anger. But, as I said before, he isn't some steril character, this is a man who heard the planes crash, a man who has a friend that lives right next to ground zero, a man that has an other friend who is attracted to his teenage student. I won't write a long review for this, because, this movie isn't about the plot, it's about the emotions, and to understand that, you have to see it. 10/10",

Norton plays a drug dealer that through his going into jail, has to reflect his life for probably the first time, and comes to the result that it`s a f***ed up one.And on the drug dealers life, the watcher comes to the result that the other charachters in this movie have also such a life without sense or happiness.",

The use of cameras with multiple shots gives a very interesting effect and that's probably the best part of the movie. Edward Norton is very good and his \"bronze\" face gives a good idea of the troubles going through his mind. It is also interesting to see the first pictures of New York after September 11: looks like it took more than one year for a director to find the courage and shoot scenes of Manhattan. Dialogues are quite realistic and Norton's monologue is simply wonderful and worth the whole movie! There are, though, a few bad points: first of all the movie tends to fall a bit too often in the topic of the (ex)towers, especially with small but frequent \"brackets\" in dialogues. Secondarily it tended to become a bit too pathetic towards the end, but I understand it was supposed to be a pathos climax. Anyway altogether it's one of the best movies I've seen this year (which has not been a very good year for American cinema, so far), and the monologue is cool!",

This film accentuates neither black nor white, but focuses on human beings, as if the collective sum of the consequences of their individual choices represents a vision of a newly emerging morality... \n\"...life that almost didn't happen\"  What a searing sequence of images, so exquisitely haunted by the chilling reminder of the unspoken, unseen ghosts of those missing lives, and the lives that will never be, images filled with such an appreciation for life, that continually promises a world that might have been, before reminding us, instead, with a kind of effortless sock-in-the face, of how frail and vulnerable we really are, particularly in the aftermath of 09-11, despite our swaggering bravado. This is a farewell to freedom, from the world we once thought we knew, revealing instead such a powerful portrait of people struggling to overcome their own personal traumas, both internally and externally, and like the lights that shone where the towers used to be, a shining testament to the resiliency of the human soul, what we have, finally, is a work of art, a film that achieves a moving and enduring spirit of humanity.",

The switching back and forth of Norton's character does provide with a transition but doesn't really solve its purpose of vitalizing the movie. I shall hence give this move a 6/10 for the direction and the dialogues. The screenplay was good and so were the characters.

In every instance, however, I must applaud Lee for attacking subjects we don't see in other films.The film plays on two levels. First, it is a morality play about a man who has fowled up his life to a degree that he must choose losing all those he loves or staying grounded and accepting the possibility of hope to help him through a long line of dark days.The film also explores post-9/11 New York. The characters respond to Russians and Koreans and blacks and whites and Jews and whoever else seems to be of the moment. Social commentary additionally gives way to psychological profiles of the characters. What is friendship? Honesty? Who truly loves you? Who can you count on when the going gets rough?It is this exploratory societal cleansing that leaves a bitter taste. What saves the film is the stellar performances by the reliable cast. Also, the ending is one of magnificent proportions. It will leave you questioning your own morality while sympathizing with the main character.Had the film settled on that route the movie could have been great, like the Spike Lee we're used to.Rating: *** out of ****",

            "content": "To see the ads for this film, you'd think, \"Wow, Spike Lee has gone and made an action film about white people.\"  But you'd be wrong in the first respect--there are no gun fights or car chases--and only partly right in the second--the story is about a group of friends in proudly multicultural New York who just happen to be mostly Caucasian.  Come on, this is Spike Lee we're talking about!  Did you really think he had \"gone Hollywood\"?As you probably know, the friends are spending their last night together before one of their number goes off to prison for selling drugs.  But it's pretty tame--your grandma might like this film--and it's told in a generally naturalistic style.  The friends talk, they laugh, they cry, they get drunk, and talk some more.  Deep down, they're all pretty decent people, even though one is an arrogant Wall Street broker, one is a convicted drug dealer, one is contemplating sex with an underaged student, and one is a girl basking in the luxuries afforded her by drug money.  Their lives go on, even as the clock ticks down to something that is taken for granted in most movies, but is as traumatic and tragic in this film as it is in real life--prison.Which brings us to the controversial visual references to 9/11.  In my opinion, their inclusion is a stroke of genius on Spike Lee's part. Sure, it is quite jarring when you see the actors speaking their lines in an actual shot in front of the hellish pit that is all that remains of the World Trade Center and the 2,800 human beings who died there.  What the hell was Spike Lee thinking?  The movie, the dialogue (most of which was written before 9/11) is so trivial compared to the reality of that pit.  The juxtaposition of art and a real-life horror could be considered obscene, except that no one can really doubt that Lee--who grew up practically a stone's throw from the WTC and is a New Yorker to the bone--feels the grief of 9/11 as much as anyone.  But still, is it just bad filmmaking?  Like some awe-struck school kid with a camera, was Lee unable to resist memorializing a historic moment because he happened to be filming nearby, disfiguring his story in the process?In response to such concerns, let me say, first of all, what choice did he have?  Here he was, filming a \"realistic\" film about New Yorkers, filming in the summer after New York's greatest disaster.  Was he supposed to ask New Yorkers to remove all the post-9/11 American flags from their windows and cars?  Even if he did have the audacity to do that, then the film would be about the past, or else would be situated in some fairy-tale New York like in the TV comedies where 9/11 will never happen.  But he wanted the film to be about the REAL New York as it is NOW.  Is that such a crime?  9/11 happened, and it intrudes constantly into the consciousness of New Yorkers even as they get on with their lives and go about their business (which includes making movies).  And that, really, is what 25th Hour is all about. It's about how life goes on when bad things happen--even very bad things. It's about how the pettiness of the Wall Street broker is nothing compared to the sexual obsessions of the school teacher, which are nowhere near as bad as the sh** that the drug dealer is in, which in turn is downright laughable when it's being discussed near Ground Zero.  There's not necessarily a tidy moral to this fable.  But that's life.  And the context of post-9/11 New York helps us to see that these characters, despite their shortcomings, aren't really such bad people, and allows them to recognize it, too, which reinforces the underlying sweetness of this film.",

            "review_title": "What I got from this film...",
            "content": "This was a great film, in my opinion. About half way through, I didn't think I was liking it at all, but by the end it all came together wonderfully. Here are a few things I have to say about some of the deeper meanings of this film, my own little take on what I think it was trying to get across:The tagline was \"can you change your life in a day\"- it never claimed you could. What Monty discovers is that he is going to have to live with the choices that he made. For every action, there is a reaction.\nMonty is portrayed as a basically good guy to appeal to the basically good guys who might go see this film and might be able to get something from it. There are a lot of hauty punk kids out there, or people who think they are basically good, and they might be pretty nice people. But what this film showed was that it is your decisions on how you live your life that make the difference, not how \"nice\" you are. In the end Monty tells Nat to forget about him and live her life, because he loves her. The whole thing at the bar was just a set up for several things to happen, for different people to bump into each other and say some things they probably wouldn't be saying if Monty weren't going away for 7 years.\nThe rant, as mentioned before, is Monty trying to convince himself that he doesn't need the city, or his friends, or anyone. That everything is everyone's fault, and he just doesn't give a damn anymore. But in the end, he obviously sees that this is just a false pretense he's put up. He really is going to miss all those things. He has just been too scared of being vulnerable, as his friend the teacher said earlier- guys have a tough time showing emotions. The WTC, Bin Laden, Patriotism thing is what is real today. It wasn't being used as a promotion. If it were, why wasn't it even mentioned in the preview? Rather, these things are the backdrop of where the characters are all living. In this aspect, it's a period piece. No one gets mad at Casablanca because it has all those Nazis, or Gone With the Wind for having slaves. Why? Because those are the time periods it takes place in, and that's what was going on then. Likewise, 25th Hour has its own setting and its own periferal things going on. The message of the film wasn't that Monty was stupid for being greedy. It was that he was stupid for ever taking the path he took at all. And the subplots were all parallels. The point of the film is that the decisions we make are important, and we should try and make the right ones, instead of the ones that work for the hear and now. The ending played out in his father's mind is perfect. He basically lays out what could have been, how nice things could have been. And like he says, it came so close to happening, but never did. That life will never exist for Monty, and why? Because he had already chosen the life of a drug dealer, and you can't change your whole life in a day. This was a deep film, and not for everyone. It's not entertaining, it's thought provoking. And as a final note I have to add that the whole cast was fantastic, especially Edward Norton, who will some day take home a stack of Oscars. He's already earned several that he has not gotten.",

It was with this intrigue in mind I watched the film.The first point that strikes you is the anger in the dialogue and the mis-en-scene nearly always reminds you where you are: New York. Somebody had to make a film directed at 9/11 sooner or later, and Spike Lee took it upon himself - and passed with credit. He doesnt direct a script towards just religious fanatics, he directs to all groups living in New York, in one of the most powerful soliliquy's I have ever seen in film, The F**k you speech. Edward Norton is as always calm and has a real presence on screen, I thought the two other actors in his shadow were great too. The film becomes slow in the middle, it has to drag in one night, but the ending makes up for this. Whether the end was a dream or not, it needed such an end; the American dream is still alive and can be achieved; F**k you to the people in society who want to stop it. Overall, 8/10.

I thought the film was very refreshing and very introspective.  I have only seen 1 or maybe 2 other Spike Lee movies.  This might have led to a more favorable review since certain complaints were about repetitiveness from his other works.  I had no problem with the editing (excessive jump-cuts) or sound (I thought the sound mixing in the dance club scene was actually well done).  The movie stood out to me for several reasons.  I loved the whole countdown theme to the movie. The countdown that your life as you know it is going to be over in a very short time.  When I enlisted in the Army a while back there were parallel feelings.  You get your orders and you know you are shipping out in 'X' months, then it becomes 'X' days, then 'X' hours.  Your not sure what's going to happen to you so you think this might be my last time to live like this (at least for awhile). While prison would be an uncomprehendible horror to be on your horizon, there is still that feeling of a 'countdown' going on in the service.     I thought the DEA officers and the scenes they had were great too. The whole interrogation scene where they try to get Norton to spill the beans on Nikolai was intense.  It wasn't filled with yelling or agents punching people like you might find in a similar film. Instead it was filled with incredibly powerful dialog and an interesting introspection into how easy it would be for the DEA (or any officers) to put some incredible pressure on someone to cough up some info.  'Playing ball' as they put it.  I thought the agents mannerisms were extremely entertaining too ('well shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit').    Hoffman's character's whole obsession with his 17yr old student was great too, although a little more dissection would have been preferred. And Pepper's character was great.  Their whole friendship thing just shows how different people can become over time and still remain friends.  Those 3 characters would have never been friends had they met after high school.    I thought the WTC construction scene was very well done, not over the top and had a good fit in the movie.  I'm glad it was in there, as well as the 'no F-U' bathroom scene.  This movie brought a lot of things to the table that many directors neglect, or more honestly don't have the insight to even see.  This movie is in a category of it's own from a direction/writing standpoint.  I recommend this movie in many aspects.",

This is a serious film made great by excellent acting, writing, and directing.The slice-of-life plot is very simple, but revealed in a flashing-back, jumpy way that might be disorienting for viewers who are not up on the language of the past decade's crime-genre storytelling--and I don't mean just the dialogue.  Key elements are suggested, rather than developed explicitly, leaving the viewer to make predictions that, refreshingly, end up being just a bit off target.  (I watched this with a Kunming friend who speaks excellent English, but couldn't quite follow the narrative without some pauses and explanations.)  Be patient and see this through.This movie is American filmmaking at its best.  Thanks, Spike Lee and all the cast!",

Monty Brogan( Norton) a dealer gets busted and spends his last moments with friends,family and girlfriend before sent to prison.From the start you get introduce to Monty and his partner who come across a dog beaten left for dead,Monty in his best nature keeps Doyle or Murphy alive or depending on the law. The tone of the movie is set with its cadence of humour and darkness. It's watching De niro and Scorcese. Monty plans a final night out with Jacob (Hoffman); a teacher who has temptations for a student played by Anna Paquin. Frank(Pepper) a stock broker who is a ten with a big ego if you catch my drift. His girlfriend Naturelle (Dawson) who might of or not sold him out. What you get is a great character study of their past and present and with the ever talented and under-rated Brian Cox. He is Norton's father and paints a perfect ensemble of a flawed and potential human portrait. Spike Lee and writer David Benioff dictate angry in class,post 9/11 and character studies. What you get is Monty in a sense of realization of who what his friends and girlfriend think and his overall view on how this screw up time was. Not a moment goes by that is better than the last perhaps beyond too good. A purely great film and one to watch on your 25 th hour.",

            "content": "Think of the innumerable bad guys that James Bond has ruthlessly dispatched over the years. Not the megalomaniacal villains of infinite ego, just the faceless and nameless body-bags that are just mild plot inconvenience. These people are such an unquestionable part of the world and they're a cog in the machine that keeps the plot moving, but we don't really think about this because these films don't invite us to think deeply about them, about how they became involved in these ridiculous plots, about whether they have a family or if they're struggling with the guilt of what they've left behind to pursue this life. Clerks thought about this over two decades ago, in relation to Star Wars. 25th Hour gives its narrative to one of these people; Monty Brogan is one of these elementary parts that helps sustain an entire operation, something that is taken for granted. He's a drug dealer, and of course there's nothing noble or commendable about that, but rather than being solely defined by that title, he's just another guy. So Monty Brogan is going to prison. Although this is an unalterable conclusion, he still exists in a kind of transitory state, 24 hours of purgatory, between the closing of his old life and the beginning of a new one, in which judgements can still be cast and relationships re- defined. Edward Norton always verges between 'everyman' and slick self-possessed star, and here he does kind of exist between those two states. As he goes about these final hours trying to ensure some sort of stability, we see both a man who's got that typical wit and verbosity of a protagonist who can always summon the correct words, a man seems to balance the immorality of the job from which he thrives with small moments of compassion, like his saving a dog in the opening scene or giving bills of cash to a sleeping tramp, but also the selfish dick who hasn't quite balanced the good deeds with the bad. There's sometimes a little of his character from Fight Club, except here it's not his masculinity that's in question, his impotence arises from the realisation that he might have wasted his life.And that feeling of uncertainty and things being questioned exists throughout, both in camera and subject. The cinematography is often kind restless, jumping from this position to the next, giving energy to environment that doesn't seem to have any. When Philip Seymour Hoffman is in English class with his students, there's a feeling of listlessness offset by this cinematography, and then later when scantily-clad student Anna Paquin challenges him about her B grade, in her disarming approach of both flirtation and contempt, the erratic camera almost turns this into some sort of intoxicated sit-com. There's also this occasional editorial choice that happened twice early on in the film in close succession and then (as far as I could tell) not again until the end, in which a certain action is shown twice, from a different angle. This happens as Norton and Hoffman move to embrace each other, and it's almost as if the film is stuttering and re-adjusting itself. In these weird moments the temporality of events is being affected, because I thought maybe these were supposed to be small but defining moments in his life, but maybe the reason is indiscernible.But what's clear is the film's immediate reaction to 9/11. The book was written before this happened, but just the very nature of it being incorporated into the film surprised me, not because it's a deliberately provocative move but because in the wake of such unfathomable tragedy people would choose to interpret it that way. But this isn't some fantasy land in which all real-world contexts can be ignored. They were edited out of Spider Man, but to do that here would be ignoring something very important about New York, and by extension America, and that's really what this film is. There's a moment in which Barry Pepper and Philip Seymour Hoffman are standing before Pepper's apartment windows, with a full view of the devastation of ground zero. The camera never moves throughout the entire discussion, in stark contrast to what I previously described, and so what you get is an evocative mixture of character and real world consequence. Monty Brogan isn't even present, the topic of discussion, and the script changes perspectives really subtly throughout the entire film, because it's aware that we can learn about our protagonist effectively through other people, and vice versa, but also that the characters can represent something larger than themselves. Barry Pepper is the slick semi-yuppie, voice of masculinity, Philip Seymour Hoffman, ever reliable, ever wonderfully uncool, is emasculated and anxious and never quite comfortable anywhere, his character described as someone who ran away from his privilege and Edward Norton lies somewhere in between, a man with money and composure but lots of things tearing at him underneath. During his now famous vitriolic monologue in a bathroom mirror, he sees the words 'fuck you' written on its corner and in retaliation releases and explosive condemnation on every culture and ethnicity present in New York, all reservation Norton had kept at this point gone as the melody of his words almost become a poetic performance piece, something which is echoed in the final monologue delivered by the father, Brian Cox. But here, as we cutaway to portraits of the people being described in borderline-racist terms, we're not seeing a character display a sweeping racism or misanthropy for everyone, but a man deflecting his own insecurities and defeats onto every other person available. It's America as both the large multi-cultural nation still thriving in its diversity, and America as a single man who is trying not to lose everything because he might have fuckedup the idea of the American Dream.",

I would have liked that to end a little sooner.Other than that it's really an excellent film.  It's not afraid to set it's characters in a post 9-11 world, and it's not afraid to let the characters say what people are thinking.  There's a lot of great dialog in the film, and the performances by, really everyone were really quite terrific.  The film doesn't try to make Ed Norton seem like a hero, we know what he's done, and we know that he deserves punishment.  There aren't really any surprises, yet the action and dialog are captivating.  It's a very well directed movie, with a lot going on it in.  It is complicated, and there aren't really any easy answers to any of the questions posed by the film.  \nI recommend this film to anyone who enjoys dialog/character driven pieces. It runs a little long, but I think it's worth it.  It's not experimental in anyway, but it is not afraid of itself.  It goes after a lot of issues, and I think does a very good job with them.",

            "content": "In \"25th Hour\", we follow Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) through his last day as a free man before a 7 year maximum security sentence.  Brogan is a drug dealer - his economic status reflects a man who has done we'll for himself for a long time.  This last-day device plays fast and loose with legal procedure, since someone convicted of his crime would not likely be free, nor would he still have his posh apartment.  As a result, I wondered from the beginning if the entire story was a fantasy sequence, but the numerous fantasy-sequence narratives throughout suggest we should believe this is in fact his reality.Putting that aside: Brogan spends his last day walking his dog, visiting his father, and arranging to spend an evening with his girlfriend Naturelle  and his two oldest friends, Elinsky (a teacher) and Slaughtery (a stockbroker). We are provided tantalizing glimpses into Elinsky and Slaughtery's characters that ultimately do little to inform their perspectives on Brogan's situation, but make up interesting subplots nonetheless, and give both actors the opportunity to flex their acting muscles.I have not read Benioff's novel, though I suspect it is excellent. Unfortunately, in adapting the tale for the screen, he demonstrates that he is a writer who depends on his prosaic skill to help him through weak points in his story.  It feels as though he wanted to ensure his favorite bits of writing made it into the film whole, and although the two longest monologues are powerfully delivered and well written, they take the short (or long, as the case may be) route to illustrate character development by amounting to minutes of exposition.  Film is the medium in which a story unfolds before the viewer, who is called upon to ascribe meaning to what's seen.  Little opportunity to draw our own conclusions is provided when it comes to internal conflict, and instead the ambiguity lies in the actual events that take place.  I consider this the essential weakness of \"25th Hour\".Spike Lee plays Benioff's game with montages and clever devices to illustrate the long speaking pieces.  But these are devices Lee is known for, and I don't think he stretches too much as a director in this picture. (To be fair, if I wanted a director to do a good job with my dialogue-heavy character study, I would call on Tarantino or Smith; I suspect Benioff worked with Lee because he knew his vision of his novel would be respected.)A truly excellent musical score runs throughout the film, slightly more than background but ageless enough that it will not seem dated later.If Lee had taken the initiative to give us some kind of character arc for any of the film's characters, my rating would be much higher.  But the conflicts Brogan faces are weakened because we have too much information; there is never a sense of urgency because his suspicions of his betrayer are refuted at every turn.  When we do learn the truth, we do not have enough invested in that character's identity to be shocked or even relieved.  This makes the pace flag and the end seem anticlimactic.  Perhaps it is supposed to be - maybe the point is that the last day of freedom is just a day like any other day and the end of it is still the end, but I need more from a film's story to really be satisfied.I give \"25th Hour\" a 6 for strong performances, with a cautious recommendation that it is worth seeing once, but probably not again.",

There's really no plot, just a man spending his last night out and about before he goes to prison. Even when you think there might be a big reveal about who fingered him, it's very ho-hum. There's very little to relate to the characters here as well, unless your a drug dealer, have a friend that fantasizes about making out with his underaged student, or a friend that fantasizes about your girlfriend. It was an odd combination of people for which you had very little understanding and no empathy. In a character driven movie such as this, it makes for an absolute bore. The only interesting character, who seems to have normal feelings and emotions is Edward Norton's father. If you are on a plane or bored out of your skull, you might consider watching this movie, otherwise spend your money and your 2 hours and 15 minutes elsewhere, because it seems like the movie wraps up in the 25th Hour.",

            "content": "Spike Lee is a director that it took me a while to watch. Call it the prejudices of growing up in a southern right wing Christian family, but I always got the impression that he was a racist black man blaming all the black race's social ailments on the white man. Having been raised by members of both races, I'm not fond of that type of mentality. Finally, I decided to educate myself on Lee's films, and started with the amazing social commentary of Do the Right Thing. Boy, was I wrong. Since then I've watched a few Spike Lee joints and never got the impression that he was a racist, but that he was highly aware of the racial and social tensions that came with living in the big city, and you see a little bit of that in 25th Hour.In 25th Hour, we meet Montgomery Brogan, a former heroine dealer for the Russian mob recently pinched and spending his last day as a free man with his family and closest friends before spending the next 7 years behind bars. Among his friends he has: Jacob Elinsky (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a high school English teacher coming to terms with his crush on one of his students (Anna Paquin); Frank Slaugherty (Barry Pepper), Monty's oldest friend who's dealing with the fact that his best friend is a drug dealer and he never tried to stop him; Naturelle Riviera (Rosario Dawson), his girlfriend who may or may not have sold him; and his dad, James Brogan (Brian Cox), who would rather see his son run far away and never come back than go to prison.25th Hour is more of a character study than anything else. The movie surrounds a party where each member of Monty's entourage comes to term with what's going on in this life. While featuring what's going on in the present, we also see flashbacks that help flesh out the history of some of our more notable characters as Lee expounds on the whodunit of selling out Monty. Lee still approaches the racial and social tensions as Monty fights with his subconscious in an effort to remember that he screwed up his own life. Lee does a great job at presenting the struggles of life in a big city, and as always in a Lee movie the big city is a living breathing character in and of itself.The acting pedigree in this movie is nothing to sneeze at either. Featuring Golden Globe and Oscar nominated talent such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Anna Paquin, and Brian Cox, as well as other notable actors like Rosario Dawson and Barry Pepper you expect nothing but the best. The movie completely belongs to the tortured performance of Edward Norton. This performance recalls his work in American History X, while delving into different areas of guilt, depression, and owning your situation. I would argue that Norton even goes deeper into the character, giving a more nuanced performance that is less preachy than he did in the aforementioned movie.The one main fault I would have to pin on this movie is pacing. For the most part the movie flows perfectly, but the flashbacks, while serving to build up the characters, don't help the narrative flow properly. If you were to ask if this movie is an enjoyable movie and worth watching, I would have to answer with an enthusiastic yes.",

Somehow it manages to have a happy ending without really having one. The idea of someone wishing he had another hour on top of the usual 24 - to get things right - appeals to me.WHAT'S WRONG 1. The first scene with the finding of the dog does not really work. There is too much dialog, and this \"Russian mafia\" guy (so highly praised by the director in his commentary) is not that great after all. It is a bit too obvious why the scene should be there and it is a touch too long, dragging the lines as if this were a Woody Allen movie. 2. For some reason Spike Lee included lots of \"patriotic\" scenes with flags waving, 9/11 scenery, firemen \"heroes\", etc. All this has nothing to do with the story and is just not right. Even if someone should argue that this film portrays a personal tragedy against the background of a national tragedy, it still does not make sense. Was he just trying to be polite, sympathetic, patriotic, nationalistic? He shouldn't have bothered, really. Maybe they thought the film would sell better in America, because of this \"patriotic\" streak, but they injured the film, artistically.",

You say this istypical Spike Lee throwing in his own editorial voice out ofnowhere. Well for your information, both those scenes are taken straightfrom the novel this movie was based on. So stop complaining.If you haven't seen the movie, I recommend it.",

The second time through I thought it was brilliant, because I dropped all the expectations of what the movie should be and took the movie as it was. It is a deep, thought-provoking film and I am glad I gave it a second chance. Edward Norton gives a great performance and the dynamics of his friends is great to see, especially when they move from their boxes.

Thumbs up for Barry Pepper aka Frank Slaughtery he's the more serious friend of Monty and as you will see in this movie, only real friends do things for each other as a \"last meal\". Don't mind anyone who's saying something about things could be better or this couldn't be real!

Is it he or his agent responsible for picking out interesting movies?Ed Norton plays the role of an Irish, New York City street raised kid, who made his life a glamorous one through not so glamorous ways.  Great life, fabulous loving girlfriend, and extremely popular around his circle of friends, one doesn't know what he does for a living until the government  is tipped off about his illegal activities.   He now has one day to think about his life, about what went wrong, and how he is going to handle the last 24 hours as a free man.  Monty, after all, is going away for seven long years.While his 24 hours tick off the clock, there are several sides to the story that needed to be told.  His friends played by the talented Barry Pepper, and the ever versatile Phillip Seymour Hoffman, speak amongst themselves regarding about the finality of the consequences that have befallen Monty. As they try to grip with the unthinkable issues, we also see Monty himself trying to cope with the failure of his life and the realization that he was too greedy.  Most memorable, and by far away the best scene of the entire movie was his soliloquy to a bathroom mirror, for which I call, `F&*$ You' speech in which he blames virtually every sex, race and religion for his misdoings. Of course, and in the end, he comes to the realization that his bad judgement, and not the society which has cast him out, is the cause of his problem. The dialogue for these 5 minutes alone should have gotten this movie considerable mention for a screenplay nomination alone. \nRegret.That's the main sentiment that you get Monty is feeling.  And it is done very well done.  The movie moves along at a slow pace, but keeps you interested the whole way through.   Unfortunately there are times in which Spike Lee, takes us on a dead end, such as Jacob's weakness for a 17 year old student, which is really a plot that goes nowhere and has absolutely no relevance to the story at all.There are several references and cinematographic shots of the aftermath of Sept. 11. in this film.  The movie was filmed shortly after the tragedy, however there is more than just a message of homage here.  In the opening scene you see the skyline of New York with two beams of light, most likely to show that America is not beyond being bloodied.  A fitting parallel when you consider that Monty all but had assumed a `bullet-proof' lifestyle right up till the moment the DEA agent said how uncomfortable his couch felt\u0085.This movie may not be a great movie, but it is an interesting watch.  Spike Lee has not done anything terribly well in awhile, but this movie was enjoyable, and will keep you thinking about it for awhile after it is finished. Grade:  B-",

Norton does an understated turn compressing a lifetime of emotions and feelings into a few short hours.

I sat in the lobby of the theatre for twenty minutes with my girlfriend trying to fight through all the bad word-of-mouth that was coming out of the screenings before me...but that damn trailer seemed so appetizing and that CAST... Regardless, I trudged on wary but enthusiastic that maybe I would \"get it\" and would have a new film to defend and champion in typical LA dinner conversation. But, alas, no. While you couldn't assemble a better cast (where's a phonebook for them to read when you need one?) even the greatest talents need a friend in the editing room. I can see Spike Lee trying to inbue his uninspired sprawl with quick jump-cuts that replay mili-seconds of rections and small movements ala mtv (or was it Godard...I lose track sometimes)the effect doesn't energize but simply make you wonder why someone would ADD to make this slow-mover even longer. It's the equivalent of a cinematic stutter that contributed to an overall lack of urgency and constantly left me wishing the whole thing would just 'get on with it'. Leaving the theatre one is left with a feeling of loss...unforunately it is not for the characters, their dilemna, or the obvious calamity that has shaken the great city (that is self evident and always present in our lives). It is a loss of the potential for a great movie. Lee's obvious talent, the immense ensemble, an intriguing concept play upon your self-dount of your gut feeling that, yes, you did just walk out of a boring movie. Lee's spoil of cinematic riches to play with truly leaves one wondering what went wrong in the kitchen and why the temperature wasn't turned up on this cake that didn't rise.",

I wanna set things straight right now! 25th Hour is Spike's finest piece of cinema since Malcolm X, Do The Right Thing or Bamboozled.     If you people have seen my other comments on this website U know I am a New Yorker. I was born in the Brooklyn and raised in the Bronx.I left the Bronx moving into New Jersey with New York in my heart.Since 9/11, I had a gritty view of New York. New York ,to me, looked like a post apocalyptic city. The days weren't the same, the streets weren't the same, nothing was the same. I just like any other Spike Lee fan was estatic when I saw the trailer for 25th Hour for the first time.I had to mark down the calendar for the release date.When it was released, it was released only in New York and Los Angeles. I saw the film, and I was blown away. I had to see two hours plus of great cinema that night.This was a great combination for a movie.    Usually movies have a good story but bad script (Cradle 2 the Grave), a good set of actors but bad movie (Pearl Harbor). Suprisingly, I saw a good movie with incredible acting. That \"F- You\" scene alone can out do any great movie. Edward Norton was incredible. That was his greatest movie. Enough with the actors, all credit goes to the greatest director of all time Spike Lee. The scenes of the film all go back to my view of New York, gritty and post apocalyptic. 25th Hour gave the people who lives in the other 49 states a good look at New York. What I most liked about it was the conclusion because it was a typical Spike Lee tradition ,the movie goes one way, the conclusion goes the other. The movie had no real story and turned out to be brilliant anyway. When everything was said and done, all I can say was God bless Spike Lee.",

You feel good about taking the crap (watching the movie) and the diamonds (good scene) are a nice thing to find.  But, you have to stick your fingers through the excrement to find the diamonds.  At least, with this movie, there's one really huge diamond at the end.This is a genuinely bad, uneven movie.  Storylines are thrown, particularly one with Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a teacher falling for his student, played by Anna Paquin (who is fiery hot in this movie).  It's acted great all around but it has no point being in this movie.Spike Lee set out to make three really good short films and stuck them into too long a movie.  One short film is reflections of a New Yorker on post-9/11 feelings in the city (a really good scene in the protagonist's father's bar where he tells basically the entire city to \"fuck off\".)  One short film is on the reaction of the entire city to 9/11.  And, the third film is the actual billed one about a man's last night out of jail and trying to find out who turned evidence to put him away.The third film really sucked!  The first two were well done but should have been a different film.  I can see how this film got mainly 8s and 9s on IMDB since it evokes strong feelings on New York and 9/11.  But, just rating the movie on what people usually rate movies on such as plot flow, dialog, and acting, this is a 5/10 (it wouldn't even rate that except the last scene is truly one of the great pieces of cinema of 2002).  If Spike Lee wanted to make a 9/11 movie, he should have just done it.",

            "content": "So I found a clip of this on YouTube and this film looked interesting. Before reading my review, I'm going to point out what I feel are the most powerful spoilers. I have decided to break it up into Orange and Red levels.ORANGE LEVEL Spoilers (major spoilers, but not really described in detail. Stop here unless you want to be spoiled before seeing the film) What this film is about, is about a drug dealer named Monty (Eddie Norton) who's about to go to jail for 7 years after being apparently busted (IMO, if he was busted he'd already be there). So, I guess he decides to turn himself in but have a last night out on the town.Thru/o the last 24 hours we see flashbacks of his past and I think some about his future (like him getting busted, but once again when that happens he shouldn't still be out roaming free for a grace period).He contemplates his past actions and what will happen in the future. There is one scene where he blames piratically everyone for his actions (including bums with squeegees, immigrants packing 25 per car, and even Jesus Christ) only to realize it's all his fault. But yet even though he must pay for his mistakes we realize his little rant points out that these people/we influence people like him to do these things. Thru/o the film it shows how he's lived a carefree life as a king; going to high posh clubs not even waiting in line, with very ultra fancy vinyl sofas, the best cocktails, deep heavy color lights.....taking each of these things for granted. I myself think I have it easy, but not like this.But the thing is, that he realizes that he's taken his life for granted, carefree selling drugs and now gotta go to prison (which is definitely unfair because of prison rape (like he didn't rape, he only sold drugs)).RED LEVEL Spoilers (major spoilers, STOP HERE unless you don't plan to see the film or don't care that I spoil it) In the end his father contemplates the life he could still run and start a new life.This is where I'd like to point out makes the film confusing. If he indeed is already busted, why does he get a grace period. My theory is that he imagines the FBI guys looking in his apartment and the interrogation room scene. The FBI guys act very rude and awkward and that room is way too white except the fire alarm (and they do make white fire alarms). I mean even before the FBI guys come he talks about suicide. So we know that he knows he's going to get busted. And he doesn't want to take a bath with his gf, but then does and that's when the FBI guys come (hinting on, he takes the bath and the FBI guys come, therefore the bath scene never happened; it was just imagined).But overall, the film points out how we might live carefree and take things for granted. We realize that its not our fault that these drug dealers commit the crimes they commit. But how we might have been an influence, and because of that of how others have influenced our actions.The ending almost got me a little bit wishing, man I wish I could start a life out in the west, live in a very small town, maybe work in a small bank, bar, store, or post office. Right now I'm doing pretty well. But it just got me thinking, most of us today are so hooked on ultra iPods. But how did we get by 20-25 years ago without that? I think even that one Barry guy who must make millions would have envied Monty if he did start that new life, while Monty is only making like <$50k per year. Why? Because Monty is living the simple life while Barry must deal with the hectic stock market job.Overall I give this film 8/10. It was very eye opening, but also confusing. Also, like always, did it really need all that profanity?",

Rosario Dawson is genuinely touching as Norton's girlfriend, as are Anna Paquin and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and Barry Pepper's performance is especially noteworthy as a longtime friend whose relationship is tested to the limit. Lee has learned that less is more (perhaps through the unflinching visions of his `Four Little Girls' documentary experience) and his understated directing is what makes this film work.  Even his trademark touches are understated (a goateed Norton's paired with Rosario is a throwback to Lee's early pairing with Rosie Perez in `Do The Right Thing' and Paquin's dreamy clubwalk tracking shot is a Lee trademark as well). 25th Hour is truly Spike Lee's finest film (and two hours) to date.",

You see Bowling For Columbine, and you saw S. Penn's The Pledge...

No judgement on a single character, you'll understand it when you'll be really sorry for the traitor...

No, he's a bad businessman. 25th Hour is by far his most sympathetic-to-honkies film ever.Is this such a good thing? I love the film Crooklyn primarily because it features my favorite Spike Lee whiteman caricature: Tony Eyes. I personally have loved David Patrick Kelly since The Warriors, and Tony Eyes is such a brilliant contrivance. He is the most outrageous white stereotype ever committed to celluloid, possibly because no other black filmmaker is as smart or technically proficient as Spike Lee, and therefore no other black filmmaker has the audacity. And it's warranted audacity. Spike has got to feel special in 2002, since the 20 or 30 critics worldwide who liked Bamboozled also liked 25th Hour. I am not one of them...although...since I don't often happen upon the opportunity to give a movie a good review in exchange for a hummer, I don't technically qualify as a film critic. I'm more of a film cricket, I suppose. There's nothing to like about 25th Hour, except that it bears the distinction of Spike Lee Joints to be racist to multitudinous ethnic groups. It's interesting to see Edward Norton shine in Tony Kaye's American History X only to play Spike's white-negro in 25th Hour. Of course there's nothing wiggerish about Monty, he's very much a white boy with a grey girlfriend (the too sexy to be a good actress Rosario Dawson-anchez?) and red employers. The idea here is that Monty has to do 7 years (which is, apparently, the end of the world for a white guy, since we're all pussies, or something) but he has to have some sort of spiritual awakening first about god knows what. Then Philip Seymour Hoffman is in it.What I don't get about this marginally talented oafish weirdo is this...he's, purportedly, a staunch believer in \"method acting,\" many of his co-workers have stated that he remains in character then the camera eye is shut...yet he seems to play the same character in every movie. What's that about? Barry Pepper I can never look at again without thinking of Battlefield Earth and Brian Cox sort of p***ed me off. It's always nice to see a dignified English actor stick it to the micks, right, with his shoddy gaelic affection and tired workingman's lament blecch. There's something here about 9/11 but, outside of Monty's tirade where he complains to a mirror about every minority and ethnic grievance he can find (of course, omitting the fact that he's a drug dealer and, by extension, poisoner of children, feeding off the suffering of others and if you really want to take it a step further, starter of wars (th-ecret one-th) that led to the 9/11 he complains about) it's an excuse to abuse. The end montage is the icing on the bitter caca cake that is this Moopie.",

            "content": "This movie took on a difficult task: it was one of the first feature movies to depict life in New York City in a post-September 11th America. It succeeds in capturing an intriguing, if not exactly typical, slice of New York City life in our current society from the perspective of a number of different characters. Edward Norton gives an excellent performance, on a par with his other great work (such as The Score, etc.) and Barry Pepper is very good as well. I enjoyed the interactions between the former high school buddies, especially because of how different they had all turned out. This represent life in diverse New York City, as well as any place in the US very well. The friendships people make in high school often endure well into adulthood even when the people go off and do extremely different things in life. Philip Seymour Hoffman is great playing an English teacher at a prep school who finds himself attracted to one of his students. He balances things out by providing a subplot that focuses on a slightly less intricate problem than the one (ones) faced by Edward Norton's character. Spike Lee did an excellent job directing it, and the editing seems hip and innovative without being too innovative and distracting from the plot or something. This is truly a great movie. It will be enjoyed for years to come, and will probably come to be considered one of the best and most insightful snapshots of the decade that we are currently making our way through in American society (I guess the 2000's is what we call it.).",

This is a movie that is very easy to watch for many reasons. Filmed just after September 11, 2001, the visuals of Manhatten are beyond words. One may actually feel like they are in the city, living the pain that the vacant lots that once housed the Trade Center caused so many citizens of the great island. Lee paints a story with much detailed depth yet shallow enough to wade through without straining your brain to keep up with. The movie has an action film feel without so much action; it has a comedic feel without so much comedy. It has found a perfect resting place in a self created niche. Norton portrays a drug dealer much more true to life than most films depict. This is a likable guy that you feel truly bad for. The supporting cast is one of the best I've seen in a reasonably low budget film. Pepper is the secret ingredient here. Barry Pepper that is. Ask yourself - How many bad movies has this guy really made? It shouldn't take long to realize he made zero. He made bad movies good, without him movies like 61* and 3 would be terrible. Phillip Seymor Hoffman comes up big, as always, playing a small role that gets big attention. Hoffman isn't featured in enough films, hopefully his day comes soon. In short I would say that even if this movie were 25 hours long, I would soak up every minute of it. I beg that you would too.",

It has some good set pieces that work okay on their own, but as a whole the movie doesn't really gel. It's all over the place. It's a mess. There are at least 10 scenes in the film that don't really wind up adding anything to the story even though they're interesting to watch by themselves. And there are some downright awkward scripting moments where the actors seem a bit self-conscious at how seriously the film is trying to take itself. I wouldn't feel right rating it much higher because ... frankly, Spike can do much better, and has before, and will again. This is a misfire of a movie.

I have found some connections with Edward Norton's character of \"Fight Club\". -Masochism as punishment and liberation. as in Fight Club, Monty Brogan looked for a big beating as solution of problems. -He performs a violent solo speech to show a clear vision of the nude reality. as in Fight Club, the monologue of Edward Norton is a rare jewel.

I will be the first to stand and cheer for his underrated films such as the brilliant \"Bamboozled\". This film, however, is nothing short of a mess and an embarasment. Much of it plays like an info-mercial for the post September 11th NYC. The highly sentimental orchestral score swelling in the background as the camera lingers way too long on the \"ghost tower\" twin beams. The gratuitous use of the tower site in the story: as a background of the conversation in Barry\u00b4s apartment, the camera lingering on the workers in the pit. Also many sporadic flashes to the memory walls decorated around lower Manhattan...sorry Spike, but it just felt to ham-handed and wrong. One should not play to the knee-jerk sentiment. There is a more subtle, harder won, and truer response than all this being added to color a story with little to do with those events. It\u00b4s cheap. I was nearly mortified when the Bruce Springsteen song from \"The Rising\" (i.e. the 9-11 album) played over the closing credits. As for the acting, I found Mr. Norton\u00b4s character to be a non-entity. Rosario Dawson was enjoyable, but please, enough of the long-suffering girl-friend who is all but totally neglected by her man on their last night and is okay with that treatment, and furthermore, will wait 7 more years for him to come out and give her more of the same selfishness. A more interesting story would have been what becomes of this woman who loves this man in the years he is in prison. The movie really never meshed for me. I found the different characters and segments as disjointed set pieces. I\u00b4m not sure what happened here; too many cooks in the kitchen, funding from sources with questionable motives, lack of creative control, or just a rushed effort. Whatever it was, it shouldn\u00b4t have been released. One really, really, shoddy piece of work is the scene in the tunnel in the park where Monty provokes Barry to disfigure him before he goes to prison. Just watch the dog...this dog has no relation to Monty. This dog wags it\u00b4s tail and looks in another direction as he is being pummeled! I know it\u00b4s hard to get animal\u00b4s to act, but please Spike, cut the dog out of the scene at least instead of having it smile and wag it\u00b4s tail happily in the background. The dog is obviously a very important figure in this film, a metaphorical Monty, if you will, but right from the beginning when he is walking the dog, you can tell there has been no relationship established between the actor and the dog. Your viewing audience expects more vigilance, Spike!",

            "content": "The premise of 25th Hour is simple, but fairly original.  Monty (Edward Norton) is a drug dealer who is spending the last day of freedom with his family and friends before going to jail.  The films follows Monty as he spends time with his father (Brian Cox), friends Jakob (Philip Seymore Hoffman and Barry (Frank Slaughtery), and girlfriend Naturelle (Rossario Dawson).  The film follows these characters to various locations (restaurants, clubs, parks, etc.) and also features a number of flashbacks from Monty as he remembers various experiences that led him to his current pathos and impending incarceration. [There are some very minor spoilers that follow, but not enough is revealed to ruin the film if you haven't seen it.]I understand why so many viewers and critics have been duped by this film. Spike Lee's direction is masterful (as usual) and the cinematography is beautiful.  Lee effectively creates a melancholic mood which, to him, not only represents the characters feelings, but the feelings of post-9/11 NYC. It's a testament to his formidable talent that he's able to hold our attention in a film where nothing interesting really happens.  The only slightly compelling plot element is the mystery of who turned Monty in to the DEA, and in this film it really doesn't matter.In film like 25th Hour the focus falls squarely on the characters and their dialogue.  This is where 25th Hour falls short, because none of the charaters are compelling or have anything interesting to say.  Monty isn't an intrinsically interesting character, and as the architect of his own demise we don't feel much sympathy for him.  Jakob is a pitifully meek educator who teaches at the prep school he and Monty attended as teenagers. Jakob's insecurity is so pathetic that when he kisses a teenage student (Anna Paquin), it's more sad than creepy.  Even worse is Barry, a boorish, megalomaniacal stockbroker who is obsessed with discussing his system for rating male attractiveness to females.  Discussions among two opposite, but equally dull personalities (Barry and Jakob) are still dull.  The only character that warms the tepid cinematic stew is Naturelle, but her presence isn't enough to redeem the film.25th Hour concludes with a dream sequence which gives it more of an emotional payoff than we expect.  However, this doesn't compensate for the fact that we're forced to spend the first two hours with three numbingly insipid, one-dimensional characters.  The result is a very well made, but substantively boring film.  25th Hour is like a beautifully wrapped present with an uninspiring gift inside.",

Hell, the big Ukrainian stole the show in my opinion. Is it just me or did Miss Paquin look a little old for her role? I didn't see the film until recently, but I can see how this film would resonate with New Yorkers and Americans in general. For some strange reason, I still think it was Naturelle who narc'd Monty out. She seemed to be trying to hide something, and she just acted guilty. When she opened the door for the drug bust, it seemed that she recognized the cops out in the hallway. That's what a good film is supposed to do: make you think. In this Mr. Lee succeeded.

I have been told that Son of Sam is truly not to be missed, but I avoided it because of Mr Lee's personality which bleeds throughout his films. In the 25th Hour he is quiet and lets his actors shine, and shine they do. Edward Norton is such a gifted actor that one wishes one could see more and more of him. Rosario Dawson is doing just fine and of course, Phillip Seymore Hoffman is always a pleasure to watch.

The interweaving of his two boyhood friends and their differences both in their upbringing and the effect it has on the take on his current situation is riveting. The backdrop of 9/11 New York makes it all the more fascinating. Also, the uncertaintity of the identity of the person that sealed his fate and the awful favors he asks that only the closest of friends could undertake. A must see!",

I have to give credit to the acting in general, and the cinematography is pretty good too, but the movie as a whole leads to nothing. I'm not taking it out on the movie, but my review couldn't be better than this. There are some monologues and some characters that are noteworthy but at a certain point, around the hour of movie, i started asking myself if something was going to happen. It basically doesn't have a story. If it had been a painting It would've been a portrait, sadly not a good one. I didn't appreciate the exploitation of the 9/11 accidents as an excuse for the sad mood of the entire film. Basically it's a drug dealer that get caught and the narration of its last day as a free man, alternating with a view of his friends. A pair of scenes gave me the impression of a \"Taxi Driver wannabe\", but as much as you can appreciate them, they are mostly without rhyme or reason. The main character, as much as i like Ed Norton, isn't very likable and you can't really empathize with him. Two other things that i really couldn't stand were the music.. (i just didn't understand it, this dramatic tone all along the movie) and the bizzarre choice of editing in some cuts (the repetitions in a lot of scenes like when they hug, doesn't make no sense to me). Ultimately, my review isn't just throwing s**t on the movie, i repeat that i liked more than some things in it, but, especially in the ending, it truly disappointed me, and sincerely i don't understand reviews like \"Masterpiece of human emotions\"... you are not being honest buddy.",

While the characters begin as parodies of themselves, Lee patiently establishes them as very real people in the post 9-11 environment of NYC. The entire film is patient, a methodical character study and a marinating resonance of foreboding. To question patriotism and stability, Lee plays with red white and blue filters of symbolism , multiple camera angles and choppy cuts. Lee's power as a director are fully exposed in two extended montages which rank among the most passionate cinematic moments I have ever seen. The film evokes friendship, honor, greed, lust, envy, denial, optimism, and every actor is enthralling. I like the complexity of real life, not the fantasy of the Shire and Mordor. How this film could be completely disregarded by the Academy boggles my mind. Certainly the best film of this decade, a decade with such horrible choices for best picture that I have lost all faith in the Oscar. I puke on Chicago, the most forgettable best picture of all time.",

When i found out last year that Spike Lee and Edward Norton were working together i got excited. This is a great movie about a character who is going away for 7 years for dealing drugs. This is a raw and sad story about the reality of losing your freedom. Monty knows what he did was wrong and he has to deal with the situation. Basically he spends his last day lining up with his buddies  played by Barry Pepper and Philip Seymour Hoffman. A lot of great dialogue throughout the film with those two guys. They discuss everything from 911 to their friend going to jail and the reality of life. Anna Paquin plays a 17 year old student that Hoffman teaches and has a guilty crush on. She plays the roll well as a hyper and weird young chick. Rosario Dawson plays a good girlfriend and is amazing looking! A lot of sad stuff in this movie and a lot shout outs to new york and america. Great movie ..9 out of 10.... Oh yeah Brian Cox had a great scene at the end! This guy is talented",

First of all, Edward Norton was great for the role.  A guy on his last day before he has to serve a 7 year prison term.  I was very impressed with this movie. Not since \"Do the Right Thing\" have I seen a decent movie by Spike Lee. The movie makes you think deeply about mistakes we've made and how much we wish we could take them back.  But in the end we deal with the consequences we face when deciding to confront these problems.Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) proves to be a strong character with friends that truly care for him (Jacob, Frank, and Naturelle).  He also discovers his father truly loves him and would do anything in his power to keep his son out of prison.  The soundtrack is great and the story keeps you interested.  He even has a cool dog that he rescued from death.  That dog makes me envious since I get dragged around by my crazy Lab who will never understand the word \"Heel\".Anyway, I suggest this movie to anyone who wants to watch a movie that will make you think.

While listening to this dialogue I was thinking \"whose thoughts are these?\" Are they Spike Lee's? The author/screenwriter's? Are they a symbol of the love/hate relationship that every New Yorker faces on a daily basis with his or her mandatory neighbors? Will these people be offended once they see the way in which they are portrayed? I was especially impacted by the Apartheid diamond sellers on 47th street, \"with their dirty overcoats and dandruff\".

Now it is not easy to sympathize with a drug dealer for any reason, but you do understand Nortons character and his remorse and the ending is reminiscent of the short lived trend in some of the late 40's early 50s movies...you'll see. The only annoying thing about the movie was the NEED for editing!! Movie goers don't CARE about the teeny bopper student ansd Nortons girlfriend dancing around on an all night rave floor or a few other drawn out parts,like the 1st meeting of Norton and Natural..it should have been edited to he sees her , is interested in her and approaches to speak to her.not a 5 minute ORDEAL for the movie goer. Other than editing problems causing some boredom now and then, one is ALWAYS drawn into Nortons story (via flashbacks) and his current ordeal. Norton is so likeable, it is scary becuse he IS after all, a DRUG DEALER!!But there are a few incidents that show despite his overwhelmingly sweet side, there iS a touch of an evil street side to him.

            "content": "Spike Lee's most recent joint has a deeper personal and existential feel to it than most of his socially critical dramas about African-Americans. Lee has up till now been at his best when he is concerned with America's prejudices and social injustices, especially in \"Malcolm X\" and \"Get on the Bus\", but in \"25th Hour\" Lee portrays a White Anglo-Saxon American's last night outside the walls of the penitentiary. This is a post-September 11th film, meaning that it is concerned with the state of New York City after the attacks, and Ground Zero and bin Laden are commented on, although the thoughts are most likely that of the character Monty, and not Lee's own opinions. The whole film has a melancholy and sad feeling to it. This is of course mirrored by the leading role, Monty, played by Edward Norton, who wants to get a few things straight before leaving the world of the free behind to serve seven years in Otisville Prison (for selling drugs). Norton's performance is as always brilliant, and here he is very well supported by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper, as Monty's two best friends, Jake and Frank. Monty's relationship with his girlfriend and his father are also important factors in the film, and he even has to end his criminal career by confronting Mafia leader Uncle Nikolai.\nMonty's doubts and fears come clearly to the surface in Norton's controlled performance. He has to confront and be confronted, but his remorse is at times overwhelmingly great, making it difficult for him to say the right things to the people he cares about. Lee also brilliantly defines the law-abiding Jake and Frank, by giving Monty's two childhood pals a few scenes alone before the big night out. Jake and Frank also have their problems, and this helps build the sad feeling to the film.\nQuestions are raised about loyalty, betrayal and relationships, and Lee gives the themes equal importance throughout the film. All in all this is a more mature effort from Lee, but that does not mean that I disagree with his more agitational movies. Except from Denzel Washington in \"Malcolm X\", Lee has in my opinion never worked with better actors than those in \"25th Hour\". The result is at times disturbing and sad, but the power of the film is undoubtable.",

As soon as the viewer thinks the film will go one way it goes another which makes the film grab your attention.  But the payoff at the end didn't meet the expectations of this (re)viewer.I think the film is subsumed in trying to make Ed Norton, a drug dealer, the symbol of New York City consciousness.  I was hard pressed to see drama in this film that I can relate to.  Only a kitsch feeling of NYC superiority along the lines of Triumph of the Will.  Spike seems in this film to make a highlight reel of all the cool, hip, popular film and tv series and place it in one way or another in this film: Boiler Room, When Harry Met Sally (but without Sally), any movie with a Russian mafia figure, Oz paranoia, Manhattan, Burns film, hip-hop music videos, Law and Order, and NYPD Blue.  Just that Spike takes these films and makes them realistic, as a result the characters are all well-defined and he handles the subject matter delicately and doesn't judge.  To his credit, the dialogue is punchy and enjoyable to hear.  But he kept on harping on WTC and not focusing on the story-Spike you're not a poet or lyricist.I still maintain the best movie on WTC which preceded it by many years is Ghostbusters.  Yes it's a comedy, but look how all New Yorkers united and became a team and overcame; like the REAL unmentionable act of terror.WARNING A COP-OUT CONCLUSION (but can't help myself) But how can I truly hate a Spike Lee movie, there just cool to watch and see a different side of life.",

Anyway, better not talk about it and thinking about this absolute masterpiece: usually I don't spread my votes like confetti but this is a 9/10, possibly a 9 and a half out of 10. The reasons? The amazing talent of Spike Lee, technically one of the best since ever, finally applied to a perfect plot and a perfect script. No more excessive endings (\"Summer of Sam\") or heavy radical messages with bursts of violence (\"Do the Right Thing\"), but a totally mature movie supported by a cast accurately chosen. Rosario is absolutely gorgeous, a sexy bomb wrapped in silver, Hoffmann was born (\"Happiness\") to act the nerd role but here he gives to his character new touches and Barry Pepper is a real surprise: his broker has some of the best lines in the script and his harsh face is an incredible compendium of true friendship and tough way of thinking. And about Ed Norton, what can we say again? Just few words: he sits between the De Niros & co., with his unique style made of awareness and understatement without Actor's Studio grins. You put this all together with a heartbreaking ending, the (pure Spike Lee) poisonous soliloquy climax and the courage to face the tragedy of Ground Zero and you obtain the masterpiece.

IMHO Spike Lee succeeds brilliantly with Benioff's material.As I see it, this is a story about a group of people who have screwed up their lives to one degree or another.  Of course, Monty has screwed up royally.  So, in a smaller way, have Monty's father and Monty's friends, played by Barry Pepper and Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Life is about making choices.  And often those choices are the wrong ones.  This story is about `could'a - should'a - would'a'.  There's no happy end here.Spike Lee's direction, Terence Blanchard's score, and the high-quality acting all combine to get the mood of this melancholy film just right. Twenty-four hours after watching the film, the mood is lingering.  I like films that succeed in making you think, as this one does. Bravo!",

I can understand why they don't, because not everyone likes the same films.  But I'm not sure that they're seeing the underlying issues.The controversial 9/11 scenes were unavoidable.  How could Spike do a movie about everyday New York, without including the biggest event to happen to New York recently.  New York was a huge theme of this movie, that lays low, but is always there.  The rant in the mirror (with the  side of himself that blames everyone else for his problems), is really a list of everything that's good about New York.  These are the things that he's going to miss once he goes to prison.  All of the characters have issues, and are all portrayed very effectively. Barry Pepper was excellent.  I've seen him in good roles, but none as emotional as this character.  The film doesn't explore all of the issues to a conclusion, including Norton's, thus leaving it up to the viewer to use their creativity. The movie isn't dictating to you like almost every other movie.  I admit, I like to be dictated to by the screen at times.  But it's nice, every now and then,to have a movie that leaves room for discussion later on.  This movie is definitely not for everyone, but if you don't mind thinking a little, like good acting, and art (some of the shots are great), then you will like 25th hour.",

There are three parts that I did not understand:1)Again Spike Lee devoted too much time to characters that were not important to the plot of the movie (i.e. \"Gator\" in \"Jungle Fever\"). The horny teacher and his \"naive\" student had little to do with the movie. The scene in the club when they kissed was not needed. 2)The underlying theme of the movie is \"who set Ed Norton's character up.\" There was time alotted to \"prove\" his girlfriend wasn't guilty. The same amount of time should have been given to the Russian mobsters in thier search for the \"snitch\". 3)Finally, Monty's \"favor\" that he asks of his good friends. To beat him up to make him ugly? Why not have them fight about Naturale or about the dog or about thier friendship? Other than that, the movie was good. The acting was great. And I love the references to 9/11. 7 out of 10",

            "content": "Spike Lee's movies are characterized by their prominent moral themes. This has been the stigma ever since \"Do the right thing\" and \"Clocker\", and it's equally true of \"25th Hour\". This being said, Lee uses huge amounts of imagery to elucidate his notions on sexual ethics and racism. The appearance in the film on the surface is that Jacob is the sexual deviant; he has a crush on his student, he's desperate for a release, and he's a cheap drunk. Anyone who knows Spike Lee films, however, will note that things are never as they appear. Jacob's minor transgression is subtly juxtaposed with the style charm of Barry Pepper's character Frank (who is reminiscent of Roger from \"Roger Dodger\"). What Lee argues about sex, therefore, is that Jacob, although he is desperate and weak, is not a pervert. Neither is Frank, for that matter. Frank is a hero in the film for his honesty and compassion, and his finesse with women and his use of prostitutes is not a negative characterization. On the Racism issue, Lee uses some smart film editing to show Monty's state of mind in the washroom scene, and this is continued in the car scene at the end with the laughing minorities. Lee appropriately encorperates some common logic to illustrate Monty's hatred of minorities, but in the end (despite Osama bin Laden and the WTC imagery) Lee shows Monty's new ethos through his use of Tom, the black child on the bus. Lee's themes on racism are that playful and justified differences do exist between ethnicities. The big Ukranian is an example of this suitable racism. The same can be said of the frequent Irish comments. Lee goes on to show the face of America however. He shows the diverse nature of the New York community as at strives for a new life after death. Real hatred of race has no place in Lee's New York. This film is full of delightful secondary and minor characters. I enjoyed it not only for its big heart but also for the quality of the product. This is some of the best film editing I have seen in a long time. PS: Many people have written that the WTC imagery is misplaced and ambivalent. It supports Lee in his statement about ethos in America.",

This movie starts at all the right places, ends at all the right places and ties up every knot but the last one, one which doesn't need to be tied.

Norton) realizes that everything in his life, everything he will be losing by going to jai, seems artifical, fake, superficial and just plain wrong there is such a humanistic quality, something everyone can relate to.I also have to appreciate Spike Lees directorial choices, most notably the decision to change the script/story to fit in with the recent (at the time) events of 9/11.One scene that stood out, and always has, was in the bathroom at his father's restaurant. In the book the scenario and the word choices were a bit different, but the same idea was there. I don't want to give anything away (which seems somewhat counterproductive), but I felt that that scene alone was worth watching.Overall this is the transformation of a man from his \"tough street persona\" into a real-life, living breathing person.

Or, at the very least, I tend not to think that the sequence in question is the weakest part of the film.  Guess where I'm going with this.  I've read so many reviews of this film that mention Norton's diatribe monologue that I finally had to write another IMDb review. I had stopped long ago, thinking that my will to criticize was some youthful mistake.  I thought maybe the entire process was flawed, that criticism was a shallow and mean-spirited thing.  That writing a negative review was self-indulgent and other things I am not allowed to mention here, but mean somewhat the same thing as \"self-loving.\"  That I would be unhappy if I had made a film, and had to read a 14 year old call it boring.  Well, it is and I would.  But then one day, I realized that film criticism was no more self-indulgent, self-loving, or shallow than filmmaking.  Probably less so.  I've felt much better since.  Which leads me to Spike Lee.I like Spike Lee, I really do.  But I'm not entirely proud of myself.  I am always wondering if I like Spike Lee because I like him, or because I feel obligated.  I loved \"Do the Right Thing,\" but even it was guilty of all the things Lee's detractors often cite.  It was uneven, stylized, and self-indulgent.  Those were also its strengths.  But back to Norton's monologue.  It's uneven, stylized, and self-indulgent.  I didn't like the reading, thought it was slow and mannered.  I didn't like the notion of showing the various things he was complaining about, thought it was too showy and inferior to an unbroken mirror shot.  I didn't like the way it fit into the story, thought it was too early.  And finally, I thought it, like everything that preceded it, was too \"Spike Lee\" for this material.  Too loud.  Too uneven.  Too self-conscious.  It was still a Spike Lee joint.That it gradually stopped being a Spike Lee joint shortly thereafter, and became, surprisingly, a Spike Lee movie, is something that really delighted me.  Enough to write my first review in years.  The last hour or so is beautifully acted, shot, written, and especially, directed.  Gone is the expository dialogue trying SO hard not to be expository dialogue.  (Really, just tell me about the Rockefeller laws with a title card, or narration, or a pamphlet, or anything but a cop telling a DRUG DEALER what the DRUG LAWS are.  Goodness.) Gone are all the aggressive line readings.  But don't think that the film starts being great because Lee \"gets out of the way\" or any such nonsense.  From start to finish, there isn't a moment that feels generic.  Certainly.  I was leaning forward in my chair for the entire scene at the club, and the last fifteen minutes are mature, sad, and wonderful. All of the five main characters (besides Norton) could be the lead of a film, and I would love to see a film about each of them.  Brian Cox is, as always, great without drawing any attention to himself.This is Spike Lee's best film.

There isn't a bad performance in this film: Norton, as always, is intense, introspective, even somewhat sympathetic in spite of his character; I had no idea I was watching Tony Siragusa as Kostya until I saw the credits; Barry Pepper shows the subtle-yet-scene-stealing talent that made him a superb lead in \"Knockaround Guys\"; even little Anna Paquin shows up in a surprising turn for the young actress-a seductive, overachieving lolita who winds up with a little more than she bargained for. In addition to a superb story, great performances, and an ending that will leave you just sittng there for a moment before you turn the DVD off, this is really the first film brave enough to actually ACKNOWLEDGE 9-11 rather than timidly stepping around it.

Several others don't seem to realize that the final scene is a nothing but a dream.(One criticism that IS legitimate is the fact that in many movies, including this one, small time street dealers are portrayed to have kilos of coke and millions of dollars. Obviously moviemakers have little understanding of the hierarchy of drug selling. To make millions you don't sell 5$ rocks on the corner, you sell to the guy who sells to the guy who sells to the guy on the street.

Having done so, it has really brought my thought on this piece more into focus.  Supposed to warn of spoilers, there may be some, so please dont continue if you haven't seen it.  Firstly, hats off to Spike Lee.  This is the first film of his that I have seen and I was quite impressed, from his use of the camera to the onset variables his control of the movie was felt and appreciated.  This film shined through as a real work of art. I have read reviews claiming that there was no plot developement, which i would strongly disagree with.  While the film lacks any \"hi, my names bob and here's how i got where I am...\" sequences, this enhances our sense of the characters, who they are and what there motives and history may be.  We are not simply told what will happen to Edward Norton's character, it is pieced together from little bits of information scattered throughout the first half of the film.  It is a shame that it was introduced in all the commercials, as teh slow buildup ads a lot of texture to the story.  We are watching an eventful day in the lives of a small circle of people, and the fact that we are required to use our brains to understand who they are only serves to make them more real and compelling.  The cast was superb, there was not a single stand out flaw in the acting.  Those who decided to turn their brains on probably enjoyed this film.  It is not a story in the usual hollywood sense, with a beginning then forward moving plot and lots of whacky hyjinks and action that leads to an end completely different from the beginning.  The focus of the film is the people, their lives, their feelings, their humanity.  Those who suggest a \"who done it\" element as one of the major plots of this film miss the fact that it is not the who that is important as much as the strain and issues between the people as a result of suspicion.  There is very little that is certain, very little cut and dried fact. Berry Pepper's character threw me a curveball in every single new conversation he started, and I left the theater still wondering about what his true motives and feelings and goals were.  (spoiler)  The teacher/student romance has been suggested as having no resolution or ending.  Once again, this is far from true.  The relationship was fantasy, which in that one moment was brought back to reality.  it couldn't work, couldn't happen, and they realized that.  Ok, getting bogged down in the need to argue all the points that others have made which I pretentiously view as ignorant.Anyhow, 25th Hour is a work of art.  It is solid, strong, with a theme and purpose that stays clear throughout.  Excellent casting and performances along with adept camera work and direction create a work that looks and feels as real as films can get.  It is well worth the price of admission, and well worth seeing on the big screen.  It has been suggested to rent this movie, but if you have any interest then see it now, dont wait for it to show up at Blockbuster.",

            "content": "First of all, I can see why some people would have a problem with this film. It is one that requires attention to dialogue and an appreciation for a movie that spurts analysis in order to be better understood.  I enjoy these types of films and I think that Spike Lee's efforts are commendable. Nonetheless, he attempts to leave the viewer with a lot to chew on.  I was able to pull many analogies, metaphors, and above all, a message or lesson at the end. This film was the fist example in a film, since 9-11, that attempted to do a contextual integration of that event while implying a strong opinion about it.  Americans' emotions and New Yorkers emotions' especially were portrayed in the film in a creative manner:  the repeated imagery of the flag that subtly hinted patriotism; the juxtaposition of calm blue ground zero amidst the chaos erupting (in Monty's mind, which was  representative of the city); the tribute to death and passing as Monty was to embark on his escape to \"what could have never been; and Monty's memorable monologue as he expressed just about every gripe imaginable. I never read the book and have never even seen another Spike Lee joint so I'm not sure if the methods he used in the film are new to his style or typical of it or if they are derived from the book itself.  I was able to pull symbolism and analogies throughout the movie.  For instance, Doyle (the Dog) and Monty.  The first scene shows Monty saving a dog.  In the end, you realize that like Doyle, Monty took the opportunity to take upon what \"could have never been\".  His father helped him do for himself what he did for Doyle.  Both are able to continue a life of happiness.  Another parallel that I extrapolated was Anna Paquin symbolizing the life of drugs that Monty was confronted with.  She became Jacob's temptress which could have altered his life if he gave into it fully the same way that Monty gave into his past and ended up having to pay a big price for.  Thirdly, Naturelle his girlfriend and confidant was also symbolic.  In the end, Monty's father comments on what led to his troubles \" Of course not Monty, It wasn't Naturelle\", meaning all of what happened didn't take on a natural course and we learn that all his life could still be altered despite his tumultuous past.  This is indeed one of the major lessons Spike Lee tries to leave the viewer with. As you can see, there was a lot that I was able to absorb and a lot more that I could comment on.  From what I've read on this forum, there were others who were able to find a deeper connection to the movie.  But for those who are looking for something just above the surface and easy to be entertained with, this is not the movie for you.  I enjoy having something to think about after seeing a film.",

            "content": "The acting is terrific. Edward Norton is always brilliant. But the supporting cast is just as strong. Barry Pepper is a wonderful actor as well, and it's interesting to find out that he's from Vancouver, yet he convincingly inhabits the character of a true New Yorker. Brian Cox is only in the film for about 20 or 30 minutes, but his appearances are very memorable, and he is absolutely magnificent. After seeing him in this movie, I must add him to my list of favorite underrated actors. It's ironic that he shows up in practically every other film, yet he never gets the recognition he deserves. Hopefully, one day he will. Even Tony Siragusa impressed me. I'm not hugely familiar with him, but I saw him make a guest appearance once on 'The Tonight Show,' and he seems like a cool guy with a good sense of humor, but I wasn't sure how he'd pan out in a serious dramatic role. Well, he is great, and pulls off the Ukrainian accent with hardly a hitch. I also liked how his character would mess up on his English every once in a while, instead of these foreign characters in movies who speak perfect English, only with an accent. I'm always proud to see Philip Seymour Hoffman, who never fails to impress. One reason I'm so drawn to him is because-like me-he's an average-looking guy, yet he receives decent roles and doesn't get typed as the 'fat slob' like most actors in his weight range. So I think of him as an inspiration to all overweight aspiring actors. I once read a review for 'Magnolia' in which someone bashed him for being so ugly. Of course, this person didn't mention anything about his acting, but that just proves how superficial of a society we live in today. Many audiences are so used to seeing actors and actresses with near-perfect faces and near-perfect bodies that they can't stand to see actors who look like 'normal people.' How often do you walk outside and see people who look like Tom Cruise and Gwyneth Paltrow? Even these so-called reality shows try to include the most beautiful people possible. So people get hypnotized into thinking that's reality. I'm a heterosexual man, so naturally I'm open about enjoying the sights of beautiful actresses, but that's not going to impact how I feel about their acting abilities. And the sight of beautiful women alone surely doesn't make a film good (i.e.: 'Charlie Angels'). Speaking of beautiful women, wrapping up this talented cast are Anna Paiquin and Rosario Dawson. Paiquin is cute and effective in her role, though technically it's similar to the ones she played in 'HurlyBurly' and 'It's the Rage.' I just hope she doesn't get typecast as the teenage slut who loves sleeping with older men. But she's a fine actress, and despite these similarities, she takes different approaches to each of her characters. Rosario Dawson just gets hotter and hotter by the movie. When I saw that trailer shot where she's dancing in the club in that silver dress, I couldn't help but think to myself, 'I'd give my left leg to marry that girl.' Well, I'm glad to see that she receives good roles that compliment her acting abilities. She really has a commanding screen presence, outside of her outstanding beauty.",

Both Brogan and the nation must pick up the pieces of life and make some decisions.  In the end, we learn a valuable life lesson:  Anger is personal, and is also isolating. Action, even action of the most humbling variety, brings us into the view of our neighbors, and may lead them to help us in truly astonishing ways.\"Malcolm X\" began Spike Lee's cinematic exploration of these life lessons, but leaves raw emotion in its wake, much like Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. \"25th Hour\" is to Lee what the Ninth Symphony was to Beethoven:  The raw emotion has given way to a mature understanding.",

I think (but I am not sure) that the (subliminal) message this film transmits is the following: 1)We live in a horrible world. 2)we feel that something is going wrong or is missing. 3)in some moments we are even able to imagine how it could be better. 4)But in any case we live in an horrible world.

Excellent acting on the part of Norton and company. The characters were well-developed and easy to follow. On the downside was the plot and some of the dialogue, which at times seemed futile and empty.However, the message was clear: reality IS reality. You do the crime, you do the time. This movie is about a man who in 24 hours comes to face reality, who goes from the man who recounts blasphemies to the world in front of a mirror, to a man who blasphemies only himself. Additionally, this movie is about demoralization: how people become demoralized: how things such as money, greed, and lust lead people to do things that they shouldn't. I believe the example with the English teacher supports this solidly. Even Monty himself, who was drawn into trouble by his greed, stands in support of this hypothesis. I would recommend this movie to anyone who could understand its complexities, but I believe they could've done a better job with it. I give it a 5.5",

The straightforward premise could have been crammed with innumerable cliches. Instead, David Benioff's script creates a fascinating character study of a desperate man coming to grips with his predicament. Lee patiently follows Monty about town and builds up the narrative by employing seamless flashbacks.

Norton himself turns in an adequate but unremarkable performance, being quite upstaged by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper who, as Norton's two very different best friends, somewhat steal the show.Where \"25th Hour\" does excel is as a stylistic visual treat. It's a beautifully shot film, with a haunting score, and whilst it may offer little or no memorable dialogue to the canon of cinema history, it does offer some remarkable images. These include a startling shot of the Ground Zero site over the shoulders of Hoffman and Pepper as they discuss their friend's future, and a superb nightclub sequence where the lighting, music and a particularly sultry Anna Paquin combine to leave a lasting impression.Worth seeing, particularly for the performances of supporting actors and the beautiful shots, but nowhere near as good as it thinks it is.",

Throw in Rosario and a Brian Cox voice-over and you have the perfect film. The premise that a drug dealer gets to hand himself in after sentencing seems a bit alien to me with only my experience of the UK criminal justice system, but this a film with a definite sense of place, in particular, NYC after 9/11. I was looking for this DVD in a store today, and I wasn't sure where to look. As most music/film stores sort their merchandise alphabetically I wasn't sure what the procedure was for numbers. I finally found '25th Hour' under 'T' for 'twentyfifth'. I think they should have a shelf just for films beginning with actual numbers in the title e.g. 9 1/2 weeks, 10, 21 grams. 'se7en'goes both ways, so that would have to go in the Alan Cumming section.",

But on any of these counts, the film - despite some moments of note - fails. In many respects, it is just a cop out: the central monologue directed towards a mirror replaces DeNiro's snarling sullenness with Norton's verbal diarrhoea; the theme of passion for an underage but fiercely independent girl is directed at a rebellious schoolgirl (done twice, as if just to rub it in) rather than the teenage hooker; Travis's impotent rage against the filth of New York becomes Brogan's formulaic racist diatribe. In the fantasy final scene (in which the anti-hero is shown triumphant against all odds), Lee gives us the last image of Brogan still staring out at New York as if just to ram it home to us that, yeees, it was a fantasy - in contrast to Scorsese, who lets us stay until the end in Travis's mind. If you're trying to parody taxi Driver, how can making the anti-hero a less substantial character ridicule him? But if you're going to remake or pay tribute to Taxi Driver, why make it so much more anodyne?",

I have to admit, while watching this movie (and I don't know how Lee usually does his films, because I haven't seen many) I kept wondering if a plot twist was coming.

He pulled Oscar-caliber performances from Ed Norton, Barry Pepper and Rosario Dawson. his visual statements about New York and America, and his artful interweaving of the 9/11 scenes showed his prowess and ability to tell this story on multiple levels. He also continues his streak of talent discovery in casting the unlikely Tony Siragusa (recently retired from the Baltimore Ravens) as a Russian gangster.My one criticism of the film was the Spike Lee signature scene, which borrowed much too heavily from \"Do The Right Thing\" and sort of dropped me out of warp and reminded me I was watching a Spike Lee Joint. I think this scene should have either been trimmed or cut completely and saved for the DVD.Despite this, Spike has clearly earned at least a Best Director nomination, and I hope he does not get snubbed.",

The story itself is very interesting. Simple, yet effective.  25th takes you into the world of a young man named Monty(Ed Norton), whose got one day to live his life in freedom, before having to summit to a seven year prison term.Many creative aspects of the film make it grade A.  Ed Norton's mirror scene in the restroom of his father's bar is truly a highlight.  The visuals of a New York city post September 11th is something that also touches you. The acting is superb and the characters are unique and well developed through the films 24 hour period.

The central scene or the `f*ck you' speech scene I enjoyed more for its honesty and self dressing down than anything else.  I thought a few of the other scenes were a little dragged out.  But overall I really liked it.  It's apparent that the movie is not asking to be approved.  I thought it was a very powerful, serious, and sobering movie.  All of the performances were excellent, but I was particularly impressed with Norton and Pepper's roles.The 9/11 theme that permeated the movie is what I liked most about it. The references to that terrible day were both `subtle' and \"in your face\". The scene in Pepper's apartment with ground zero just outside for me was very strong.  Especially at the end of the scene when the camera zoomed out of the window for a close up of the clean up activity.  Very scary I thought but also very sad.  I live in Ireland and like nearly everywhere else in the world we've been bombarded with images of 9/11 on our TV screens, but this movie really brings home how sad, injured, and angry NY still is after the those terrible attacks.This movie needed to be made I think for the benefit of New Yorkers more so than anybody else.  As someone not from NY I really enjoyed it so it's axiomatic that most if not all New Yorkers will find it helpful in the evident ongoing healing process that's still taking place there.

I don't understand why we waited to see who ratted him out, it was not exciting and there was no car chases\"**Spoilers**Forget everything you just saw.  The movie wasn't really about Monty trying to figure out who ratted him out.  The story had a lot to do with 9/11. The movie starts out by showing us the gigantic lights used to represent the world trade center.  We are shown american flags on every passing car. The conversation in Barry's apartment looks over the rubble that was once the WTC.  Perhaps Spike is trying to say something about what happened, or maybe I'm wrong and he had no real point in making this movie other than to anger everyone who wanted to see more car chases.One of the last lines in the movie sums up 9/11 pretty well.  They are driving away in his last dream sequence and they show what his life would be like if he would have chosen to run.  He would have had a family, and he would have had a son and life would have continued.  However due to 9/11 that can't happen for many many people.  They wont get to \"drive away\". They wont get a chance to grow old and have kids and watch those kids grow old.Much more symbolism is used throughout the movie however I just got back for the 11:00 showing and I'm fairly tired =)****/****Matt",

I didn't really detect enough sustained racial angst from any of the characters to warrant the scene.The floating track shots are old and tired.Though Ed Norton and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are among my favorite actors, there were not enough bright moments in this movie for them to shine.

The way the flash-back scenes look like real-time makes the movie that much more interesting and almost forces the viewer to pay attention. I also like how the movie shows post 9/11 New York, rather then pretending like nothing happened and it's just another day with another drug dealer getting ready to go to the pen. If you like your movies to have kind of a raw, real life feel to it, I highly recommend this movie. In some ways this movie is a character study, but also a tiny bit of a crime drama (there is a small but memorable Russian mob meeting scene).***movie spoiler, beware***I'm sorry to those who have not yet seen this movie, but I must say one of my favorite scenes is with Barry Pepper, \"Frances/Frank\",( I find him to be so damn cute!!! :) ) & Phillip Seymour Hoffman, \"Jacob/Jake\"  is when they are in the Chinese restaurant eating and Frances tells Jacob that he is in the 60% in the bachelor pool in New York and that he himself is in the 90% because he's blessed with a very big ****. Then Jacob tells Frances that he has no manners so that should make a difference....then the scene just gets funnier to me as it goes on.Anyway, watch it if you already haven't.",

Hoffman as a tired nerd literature (?) professor, in my opinion, has his best role since \"The Talented Mr. Ripley\". The friendship even seems to convince. Recommended. 8-",

Norton can do better in his own right and he does in Red Dragon, American History X, Fight Club and Primal Fear. The story of the movie was unrealistic because someone who's committed crimes worth 7 years in prison is not going to be set free to roam the streets and commit more crimes or, inevitably, run. The 9/11 scenes did not tie into the story and I found them therefore out of place - not having read the book I didn't know Monty had wanted to be a fireman, that wasn't made clear.

            "review_title": "Refreshing and Thought-Provoking",
            "content": "25th Hour is intensely engaging-both visually and story-wise. It doesn't take the traditional cheesy way out but takes a far more interesting and though-provoking route. The film is full of in-your-face emotions, thoughts and images. It's refreshing, especially in the light of the past few years, to see scenes shot against Ground Zero, and to see characters work out their doubts and regrets. Despite the tagline and trailer, the film isn't really about `changing your life' if you had one last day. 25th Hour is a movie about choices and consequences. The film doesn't ask questions, it presents images and ideas, and leaves you to draw your own conclusions.Lately, a lengthy running time is not an unusual thing. Even a 2:15 running time isn't bad, but no matter how good the film, the viewer is often still aware of the passage of time. Perhaps due to the exceptional circumstances here (one day left) there was already a pressing intensity set by the film. Every moment was important: this was Montgomery Brogan's (Edward Norton) last day as a free man-what was he going to do? There was no mystery that he would spend it with his father, girlfriend and closest friends. If you asked anyone what they'd do with their last day, chances are they'd spend it with the people most important to them. But what if you aren't sure who those people are? It's not so much about making exciting new choices for your last day, but re-evaluating past choices. There are glimpses of regret, which must be stamped out, glimpses of doubt and mistrust, and the ever-present doom, which lurks as the hours tick by. There may not be much to be done about past choices, but that doesn't mean they should be ignored. It's only in his last day that Monty takes a good look around instead of just going through the motions and not questioning anything.On the story level, the film is already intense. We come into a story already in progress, shown only the necessities in flashbacks. The characters don't have time to dance around anything; brutal honestly, for better or worse, is what the audience is going to get. We see nasty confrontations, bizarre showdowns revealing real friendship, and the very real dealing of sometimes-irrational emotions. There is plenty of blame and responsibility-some of it trivial, some of it crucial. Sorting it out while dealing with raging emotions is no easy task, for any of the characters. And yet, the film is not a whirlwind of accusations and craziness-it keeps it slow and intense-all the more powerful when things are unleashed. Not a single punch is pulled.The film also raises interesting questions about right and wrong as well as trying to sort out the differences between `bad' and `very bad'. We see lots of bad choices and character flaws; but who should be punished? Most people are flawed, as Monty and his two best friends illustrate. While none of us may know the `good' drug dealer or the stockbroker with scruples, it doesn't really matter. No one is perfect and despite whatever good things we do, we all make bad choices at some point-can we say which choices are the punishable ones? And which ones go unpunished? Different levels of social acceptability clearly come into play to raise even more questions. Is selling drugs to users worse than kissing your underage student? And what if you rip off hardworking people on a daily basis? 25th Hour simply presents us with people who aren't altogether better or worse than most people and leaves us to make up our own minds. And after all, what about the good choices? What about the time you chose to save a dog's life and keep him? It's small and fairly insignificant, but all things considered, it is a step in the right direction. We all make choices and all those choices define us in some sense; but not all our choices are good, but neither are all our choices bad.Another bold decision in the film is the insertion of several Ground Zero shots. Some people have expressed outrage. However, these shouldn't be considered `shock value' because the 9/11 situation is there whether we choose to see it or not. And in a film dealing with `choices', what better backdrop to use than one that tells us to cherish each one? The film isn't going out of its way to say anything about life or death; it merely provides the right images. The soon-to-be-famous bathroom scene compiling all the things Monty loves to hate about New York is successfully powerful. All the blinding rage and frustration kept inside is finally unleashed. Regardless of being `ratted out', Monty can only truly blame himself for what has happened.We can see briefly in the film, as Monty rides towards his destiny, what an ideal world looks like. And the crazier this `ideal' world becomes, the larger the film grain becomes. Needless to say, we don't live in anything close to an ideal world. In a country where `politically correct' was getting more and more out of hand, it has suddenly taken a nose-dive to even more unfathomable limits. If it's shocking to see the remains of the World Trade Center, it's time to take a better look. The most catastrophic thing to happen to our country in recent years should be looked at. Just as the bad choices we make (especially when society deems them less reprehensible or else we are simply never caught) shouldn't be passed over as easily as they sometimes are. This is a film about choices and consequences. 25th Hour is refreshing because it shows lots of things people are afraid to talk about or even look at. 25th Hour is intense because it's carrying a lot of truth. And 25th Hour is important because we all need to take a good look.",

It seems this man can do no wrong and has built up a solid body of work. Norton continues his winning streak with the 25th hour.\nThe 25th hour is the story of a man who realizes that he made a wrong decision in life and now has to face the consequences.  He blames the city and everyone around him for his downfall but ultimately he realizes that he caused his own downfall.Not only is the script tight and emotional, but Spike Lee manages to draw a parallel inference between Sept 11 devastation to NY and to the downfall of Norton's character.  This movie has been criticized alot due to its references to the world trade centre but I think it works.  Not only does it set the mood for the film and for the state monty is in, but it also shows how normal citizens involved in their daily problems somehow can't escape this tragedy and are affected by it deeply in their every day lives.Barry Pepper also puts in a remarkable performance as Norton's best friend who adds humour and lightens up the mood at critical times.\nSee the 25th hour.",

            "content": "I am having a hard time believing people didn't care for this movie.  I thought it was wonderful.  Not because there was some profound statement on risks/consequences, but because the performances are fantastic.  Ed Norton has already established himself as a wonderful character actor, and has ably transformed himself into a fine leading man.  His relationship with Rosario Dawson was genuine, not tacked on, as others have said.  Living with the knowledge that in one short day you must tend to all loose ends, one of those loose ends being a potential betrayal by your girlfriend, makes her role essential.  Phillip Seymore Hoffman is wonderful as always, and Barry Pepper manages to be smarmy and likeable at the same time.  I will agree that Anna Paquin is amazingly hot.  She's also very talented.I didn't care, however, for the excessive use of repeated jump-cuts in the editing, and I absolutely did not like the montage scene Norton has in the bar bathroom where he spews social, racial, and caste-oriented insults to the city of New York.  All while knowing it is he, himself, he must blame for his impending incarceration.  It has many parallels to Spike's similar scene in \"Do The Right Thing\".  I understand he may have been trying to use it as a barometer to bookend the time between 1989 NY, and 2002 NY, but I was hoping for another tool.  Never the less, this was Spike's best film, \"Four Little Girls\", not withstanding, since \"Do...Thing\".  8 of 10.",

            "content": "I've grown used to being slightly disappointed by Spike Lee.  For the last decade plus, he has turned out strong, solid films (Malcolm X, Crooklyn, Summer of Sam) interspersed with fascinating near-misses (Clockers, He Got Game, Bamboozled).  But the stylish, kinetic brilliance of his 1989 masterpiece Do the Right Thing can't help but make his subsequent works look a little anemic by comparison.  I don't expect any filmmaker to spend his career trying to duplicate earlier triumphs, but I would hate to think any director with Lee's obviously massive talent would peak on his third film, at age 32.So 25th Hour comes as extremely welcome news.  This is Lee's best film since Do the Right Thing, and indeed the best film of the year.The premise--NYC drug dealer about to go to prison for 7 years spends his last 24 hours of freedom floating around the city bidding a reluctant farewell to his former life--doesn't begin to describe the energy and heart of this film.  It's one of those movies that (thank God) writes all its own rules for plot, dialogue and character development.  It seems restless and off-kilter and unsure of where it wants to go until it finally starts getting there, and then you're surprised to find out how much you care. Finally, in its last scenes, it shows you what it was all along, a moving meditation on possibility and loss, a poem of wistful beauty and immense sadness.The performances are strong and the writing is vibrant, but this is above all the director's film.  Lee gives us a New York City we haven't seen before, a city that looks small and brokenhearted, wedged as it is between the recent horror of 9/11 and the impending horror of the protagonist's prison sentence.  Time has become the enemy, and the overwhelming feeling evoked by 25th Hour is the desire to stop time, to turn back the clock and fix what has gone wrong.  That, of course, is precisely what human beings will always be unable to do, and the movie makes us feel that powerlessness like a cold, implacable wind.It seems perhaps the more Spike Lee concentrates on telling us about New York, the more he tells us about ourselves.  No movie in 2002 told us more about ourselves--right here and right now--than 25th Hour.",

Coming from New Jersey I was at one time in New York every weekend so I could relate to what he was saying. People from New York can probably appreciate it more because it hits so close to home. Spike Lee knows New York like the back of his hand and it is  more than obvious. He also isn't afraid of what people might think of the views he portrays in his movies. He doesn't censor his beliefs to appeal to the masses and in this day and age with all the propoganda and \"play it safe\" views of the mass media, Spike Lee's views are highly appreciated. The actress who played the underaged student was also really good. The way they shot the closeups in the club with her on ecstacy and the teacher looking up the steps to the bathroom added a nice touch. I thought Rosario Dawson could've cried a little more in the end, I mean I was almost crying more than her but she did a really good job everywhere else. Overall 25th Hour was a brilliant movie.",

I'd give that award to The Pianist or Y Tu Mama Tambien. 25th Hour is far from flawless, but when it clicks it's beautiful, and all the imperfections fade away. Edward Norton is terrific, all the critics have said that, but the surprise here is Barry Pepper. Pepper's been good before, as the sniper in Private Ryan or Roger Maris in 61*, but the character he portrays here is more complex, more fully-fleshed than anything he's tried before. He's an absolute revelation as Frank Slattery. Anna Paquin, Rosario Dawson, and Philip Seymour Hoffman all turn in outstanding performances. Brian Cox has a small part, line wise, but he is the soul of the movie. His voice-over narration guides the final seven minutes of the movie, and this could well be the best, most heartbreaking ending I've seen since Cinema Paradiso.Oh, and I almost forgot about Terrence Blanchard, who provides Spike Lee with easily the year's best score. I'm sorry, I know Howard Shore's got lots of fans, and Phillip Glass impresses many, but Blanchard's music stands on its own as a haunting, powerful tribute to New York City and the people who live there.Some people love this movie; some people hate it.

And this cast is phenomenal. The standouts being Norton, Pepper, and especially Anna Paquin.The story is a simple one written by David Benioff based on his book. Monty (Edward Norton) is a convicted small time drug dealer spending his last day of freedom with his best friends Slattery (Barry Pepper in a career making role) and Jakob (Philip Seymour Hoffman). That's it. Pretty much.There are some subplots. Who turned Monty in? His girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson) or a member of his mob connections? There is also a wonderful performance by Brian Cox as Monty's father.But the real joy of this film is the subplot between Hoffman's Jakob, a high school teacher and Anna Paquin's character of Mary, his student. Paquin proves that she's arguably the best actress of her generation with one of the most hilarious and sexy performances of the year. The scenes between Hoffman and Paquin are a delight and are reason alone to see this film.There has also been talk about how Lee incorporates 9/11 into this film. But it's not intrusive. The film takes place after the terrorist attack. Lee doesn't exploit nor ignore this fact.See this film. It is flawed but it is also at times brilliant.

Each hour was played out almost as if it really was a 24 hour period, and you were watching his last day free.There were a couple shots of the World Trade Center site during clean up, and why shouldn't there have been?  The site was right outside his friends apartment.  The film is taking place shortly after and shows when the film is taking place and where.  No big deal. As for the scene when Monty is going off in the mirror, it was not that bad. It is about time someone said exactly what they think and not be afraid of what someone else thinks about their opinions. And in the fist place, he is ALONE in the bathroom, he is not saying it to anyone's face.  How many times have you had thoughts that you would only say to yourself?  I rest my case...Overall I give the movie a 8.5, I enjoyed it, and although there was not much action like I thought there would be, it portrayed exactly what I think they were trying to.  The man had 24 hours to have a good time with friends before he was sent away and he did.  He looked back at situations that got him there, and tried to rationalize why he did it and realized that he messed up. Great Movie!!!",
