            "content": "This strikes me as a movie you will either accept whole-heartedly or trash whole-heartedly. It is shamelessly sentimental and is built on a series of absurd coincidences, but the amazing thing is it all works. The coincidences could feel like a shameless plot device but instead there is just a sense of wonderful magic, as though somehow the foundling the movie is built around lives an oddly charmed existence that transforms the lives of those around it. The movie does a wonderful job of making its characters both broad but human. This is not one of those cheesy movies that make homeless people seem ultimately wiser and nobler than the rest of us, but while they are all deeply flawed they all have a redeeming warmth. The movie is both very funny and very touching, and is really about the miracle of love in a world of harsh realities. If you're not willing to totally suspend your disbelief and give in to the movie's blatant flouting of all concepts of reality then you'll probably hate it, but if you want a charming fable this is a great choice.",

            "content": "At first glance, I wasn't sure if I would like this movie. The \"miracles DO happen on Christmas\" clich\u00e9 is very boring and I typically don't enjoy movies that employ it, but this is a very different kind of Christmas movie.We are given three homeless characters with complex personalities and backgrounds, who are as endearing as they are repellent. They take up the task of caring for a baby they found in the trash, and trying to bring it back to its mother. We learn the secrets that made these people homeless, we learn about the workings of human shame and desperation, and we learn that \"miracles DO happen on Christmas.\" But in the least cheesy way possible!The plot is very slow-moving, but still, it is interesting and very carefully laid out. This would be a very compelling live-action movie, but the use of animation adds so much visual interest, particularly the expressive (and sometimes hideous!!) face of Hana, the gangly transvestite. The choice of music is unique and very fitting: the song played during a walking-around-the-city montage is reminiscent of Clockwork Orange.Interesting and careful story, complex and realistic story, tremendous visual appeal and excellent music. I guess this movie pretty much has it all!",

The story revolves around 3 homeless people (a middle aged man name Gin, a homosexual cross-dresser name Hana, and a teenage girl named Miyuki) who discover a newborn baby in the garbage. The events follow the three as they decided what to do with the baby, trying to find the parents, dealing with their own pasts,etc (Christmas seems to be an introspective time - along with all holidays). After the first 30 minutes of the movie, everything becomes strangely predictable yet still moving and meaningful. The movie is laced with \"coincidences\" and tons of Christmas references. It touches on numerous subjects including family, guilt, redemption,etc. Satoshi Kon delivers another beautiful looking movie with a humanistic storyline. And in true Satoshi Kon fashion adds a touch of the bizarre to shake up the traditional story. This movie will be added to my Christmas holiday viewing list, which gets me into the XMAS spirit.-Celluloid Rehab",

            "content": "Having suffered through the painfully pretentious and shallow, pseudo-Lynchian mess of Perfect Blue, I was understandably skeptical about watching another film by Satoshi Kon (I have not yet seen Millennium Actress, but am now quite intrigued to do so). Tokyo Godfathers (a title which at first struck me as belonging most probably to a pseudo-psychological mafia thriller) was not only a pleasant surprise; it was the best anime feature I've seen in many years, probably since Ghost in the Shell, excluding anything by Hayao Miyazaki. Like the classic Grave of the Fireflies, Tokyo Godfathers struck me as unusual in the fact that it draws much from European cinema \u0096 English, Irish, German or Italian \u0096 while most commercial anime features try to mimic American film-making. But while Grave of the Fireflies was painfully sad and bleak, Tokyo Godfathers is irresistibly charming, and manages to be funny and incredibly touching at once like few anime films \u0096 few animated films, at that \u0096 ever achieve.Tokyo Godfathers is remarkably non-violent, as pacifistic perhaps as Miyazaki's films. You won't find any grand futuristic structures or fantastical creatures here; in fact, the animation may seem crude at first. But the characters are where the film really hits its mark. Kon triumphs, like in his excellent series Paranoia Agent, by not succumbing to the accepted prototypes and standards of how characters should look in an anime film; the lead characters in the film are all gorgeously ugly, in a way that even Miyazaki had not yet dared to do. Even the child character, Miyuki, is chubby, and not cute and beautiful in the way little girls 'should' be, by the unwritten laws of anime. Thus, Kon's characters are believable and true to life; they are three anti-heroes, outcasts from society, each running away from their pasts. Especially charming is Hana (AKA 'Uncle Bag'), the golden-hearted transvestite, who supplies much of the film's comic relief but also some of its most touching moments.Tokyo Godfathers \u0096 despite some far-fetched but amusing plot twists and coincidences \u0096 is at its core a very simple story, a beautiful little story about family, love and friendship. Few anime films are so unpretending; and thus, few anime films manage to be so strong. Watch Tokyo Godfathers; you'll laugh, you'll cry. And believe you me, ten minutes into it you'll forget it was ever animated.",

Despite what level in life you find yourself, humans share similar basic emotions or feelings.  For Gin, Hana, and the less than cheery Miyuki, an unexpected find makes them confront their past whether they like it or not.  Memories flow bringing times of happiness, regret, pain, and questions of what could've been.  There's a great character richness in this darker, grimier side of Tokyo, but Kon also manages to put in lots of random, humorous events especially by cameos from minor citizens.   Plus, how could you not laugh with Hana's feminine wiles and that manly voice!  There's a strong sense of karma here with \"what goes around comes around\".  Doing nice things and you most likely will be rewarded.  However, turn your back or refusing to help someone in need may come back to haunt you when you are stuck with no one to turn to.  Hey, maybe it's never too late to learn a lesson, no matter how much it hurts. \nSatoshi Kon's not presenting an Aesop's fable here, but like in life, sometimes doing a good deed is the best reward in itself.",

Like Perfect Blue and Millennium actress, TG wows the watcher immediately with the attention to detail. The scenes are exquisitely painted - when it is snowing you can almost smell it and feel the stillness.  And the characters expressions convey emotions expertly by subtlety or caricature as occasion demands.  Leave behind your Hollywood ideas of what a movie or worse, a cartoon should be.

            "content": "Director Satoshi Kon has concocted a little wonder of an animated film, a character based ensemble action comedy about thwarted families, homelessness in Tokyo and strange twists of fate.  A loose knit trio of homeless companions (an alcoholic ex-bike rider, a teenage fugitive runaway and a castoff drag queen) find a baby on top of a trash heap at Christmas, and find themselves caring for the child while hunting down her parents.  Warm, funny and as action-packed as many an anime (with hilarious action set pieces), this one's a charmer.  Sure, it's always possible to do these kind of things in live action (more or less) but thank God we have a filmmaker of Kon's vision applying his ample animation skills to stories like this.  It ain't all cardfighters, bounty hunters and grim vampire killers.  Sometimes, it's people, too. (not that there are anything wrong with cardfighters, bounty hunters and grim vampire killers... well, o.k., maybe cardfighters)",

            "content": "Satoshi Kon's animation films are increasingly impressive with each new release. This movie is not only a technical masterpiece of the Japanese animation style, but can also rival a good independent live-action film in its storytelling. The film's plot also doubles as a social commentary about life on the fringe in Tokyo (not only the homeless but also cultural minority and the mentally disabled), from both the inside and the outside looking in. As a Westerner, I was astonished at how the homeless characters adapted to Japanese traditional practices for their survival.The story of \"Tokyo Godfathers\" is much more compelling and heartwarming than Kon's previous films, \"Perfect Blue\" and \"Milennium Actress\", but the signature semi-realistic drawing style from his other films is still prominent. The discrepancies in movement between each character in the action sequences is particularly phenomenal. The backgrounds are intricate and perfectly painted. Note the art direction of the background buildings in some scenes to add even more connotation to the plot - sometimes they are more than what they seem! Kon is the next Miyazaki, and I predict that he will continue to bring Japanese animation films to the international foreground years to come.",

            "content": "For me, Satoshi Kon's best film is Paprika. That said, all of his films are ones to be highly recommended, they Paprika especially can have a tendency to be challenging, which can delight or alienate viewers, but they are gorgeously animated, compelling and I think very unique. Tokyo Godfathers is not quite as good as Paprika but it is a truly beautiful film and of Kon's work I'd go as far to say that it also is his most accessible. The animation is beautiful and detailed if in a different way to the more surrealistic styles of Perfect Blue and Paprika, here very intricate with very expressive character design, and very fitting with the film's tone. The music is memorable and beautifully composed, complimenting the story perfectly. The dialogue is thoughtful with some humorous touches, matching the nature of the story that is full of charm and pathos- bringing some optimism and hope into a cold world and society- without ever feeling mawkish or dull. The story is slow-folding but in a deliberate sense. The characters are full of emotions and we identify with them no matter the flaws, in short they are very true to life, none of the idealistic stereotypes I've seen all too often. Hanna is the one that stood out to me the most. The voice acting is as dynamic as you'd expect, more so in the Japanese dub rather than the English. All in all, beautiful and highly recommended. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

            "content": "This film is unlike the late Satoshi Kon's other films in that the viewer doesn't wonder if what they are watching is meant to be taken as real or if it is a dream, fantasy or delusion; here it is all real. The fact that it has a traditional narrative doesn't mean it is any less engrossing than his other films though. Set in winter in Tokyo this film follows the lives of three homeless people, one an alcoholic gambler, one a transvestite and one a runaway teenaged girl. On Christmas Eve they find a baby, which they call Kiyoko, abandoned amongst the rubbish and decide that they must return her to her parents. Their self-given mission will lead them to confront they own pasts and the reasons they are homeless and find redemption with those they have wronged. They may be on the bottom rung of the social ladder but for this one week they seemed to be blessed with amazing luck; a man they help just happens to be the future father in-law of the former employee of Kiyoko's mother, a nurse they meet in hospital in the daughter of one of the men and the teenager's father is the policeman who brings Kiyoko's parents to the homeless trio when they want to thank them.This was another brilliant film from Satoshi Kon; it is a tragedy that this brilliant director died so young. It is impossible to imagine what he would have gone onto achieve. The story, which he wrote as well as directed, is genuinely moving without ever being overly sentimental. The characters are well designed and the animation was first class throughout. While this isn't a comic film there are plenty of moments that made me laugh as well as one or two that almost made me cry. Even if you aren't usually a fan of animated films I'd recommend this.These comments are based on watching the film in Japanese with English subtitles.",

It is the third film from Satoshi Kon, whose Perfect Blue was a creepy film that I liked and I am still awaiting to view Millennium Actress.  Right from the start, Tokyo Godfathers was among the funniest animated features I had ever seen.The film quickly draw comparisons to Three Men and a Baby as well as the idea of the three wise men.  Three homeless folk with different, and perhaps strange, personalities find an abandoned baby on Christmas and make it their mission to find its parents.  And right from the start, the three end up on these crazy adventures that is nothing short of funny.Kon and fellow screen writer Keiko Nobumoto create a very witty film that at least provides endless laughter, even in moments that would normally be intense.  At the same time, the provide a touching story of three people with nothing but the clothing on their bodies going out of their way to find the child's home.If you get the chance, Tokyo Godfathers makes for the perfect holiday feature for everyone to watch.  It is highly recommended and I hope the Academy takes serious consideration when viewing this film as it is among the eleven eligible for being nominated for next year's Best Animated Feature category.",

            "content": "This rare Japanese Christmas anime movie from Satoshi Kon shows the theme of \"coincidences\". It's Christmas Eve in Tokyo, three homeless people just found an abandoned baby while searching in some trash. The three made it their quest to return the baby Kiyoko to her parents. On the way, all three meet coincidence people from their past. Gin is a middle-aged alcoholic gambler who abandoned his family when his gambling debts became too large. Hana is a transgender looking for love and good in people. He thinks he's a woman and that is why his desire that God would give him a child. Her dream in life was always to be a mother, and thus she is the most enthusiastic about taking care of Kiyoko, the baby she finds and names. Because of her upbringing, she is the kindest out of the three main characters, but is also severely ill, a fact which she hides from the others. It's barely noticeable in the movie. With all the action scenes that Hana go through, it doesn't look that way. Last is Miyuki is a teenager runaway with a trouble past. During a family dispute concerning her missing cat named Angel. Miyuki stabbed her father believing him to be responsible for the disappearance. Since then, her father had been on a search for her. The group encounters a number of odd characters on their way ranging from high-ranking yakuza man trapped under his car to drag queens. Not only that a series of miracles tend to happen to the three on their way, escaping car crashes and other hazardous. The biggest one is the ending. This movie also has one of the biggest 'twist' ending in a film that would not only surprise the characters, but also the audiences. There are key scenes that show the message of the kindness to others, such as Gin taking care of an old homeless man whom he finds dying in the street. One scene not needed was the Latino hit man and the Yakuza. It seem out of place. The art direction was lovely and the whole holy trinity/Christmas theme could have explained all of those coincidences and miracles that occurred during the movie. The late Satonshi Kon was a masterful command of satire, social commentary, and a balanced blend of reality and fantasy will live on as an immortal powerhouse. It's still a question for who this movie is made for. Most people in Japan are primarily either Shintoism or Buddhists. There only a very small populace that are Christians in Japan. The movie was probably made for US audiences. If watching, the subtitles are better to watch then dub lines. Original is better, the film is set in japan, so is more authentic if is in Japanese. One of the biggest strengths of the film is the humor. It's not the type of insular humor that only a Japanese person would understand but that everyone can identify with. The charm of the film is incalculable. You end up really feeling for the characters and near the verge of crying in touching scenes. Watch this movie during the Christmas time. Great family film, but note if watching with children understand this does have a little bit of harsh language, violence and a bit of nudity. A miracle movie.",

Sure there are lots of ridiculous coincidences as others here have pointed out but that's part of the humor of the film.This story of three homeless people finding a baby in the trash and their adventures locating the parents is more like a non-Miyazaki studio Ghibli film then your average anime. The characters are interesting and well thought out. There's mostly nothing here that couldn't have been done with live action but we would have missed the wonderful comic drawing that illustrates the personalities in a way live actors can't. The very loose character animation reminded me a bit of FLCL (Fooly Coolly) but without the hysteria.With the buckets of holiday slop that gets foisted on us every year, who would have thought that a real holiday heart warmer would come from Japan. It's unfortunate that the typical anime audience isn't interested in this type of film and other people who might enjoy and be uplifted by this won't watch a subtitled film.A couple of notes: Two reviews here are mistaken about the film. One, there is no \"gay couple\". There are three homeless people trying to survive winter together. Just because one is gay doesn't automatically make the other man gay. Anyway, the man, Gin, is clearly not gay. Second there is no scene of a gangster getting shot in the head. Something else happens but I'm not a \"spoiler\" so find out yourselves.",

            "review_title": "Dickens influenced anime is a bit too fast paced for its own good",
            "content": "Tokyo Godfathers, a 2003 Japanese anime from well known director Satoshi Kon (Paprika, Millennium Actress), is about an unlikely trio of homeless people that finds a baby abandoned on Christmas eve. Although the obvious inspiration for this story is John Ford's similarly titled 1948 Western Three Godfathers, the coincidence filled novels of Charles Dickens are an even greater influence. Like Dickens, Kon is interested in the lives of the poverty stricken. Also, Kon's film is just as full of incredulity straining coincidences and plot twists as well known Dickens novels such as Great Expectations. There are also some similarities to Dickens' Christmas Carol including numerous flashbacks and a character encountering what seems to be a future version of himself who offers him a second chance.Satoshi Kon's film is more than just a pastiche of his influences, however, he brings his own unique sensibilities to the table. For one thing, neither Dickens nor Ford would have dreamed of focusing a story on a transvestite who desperately wants to be a mother. The animation is always well done and it manages to draw just as much focus as the frenetically outlandish plot twists and turns. These narrative elements include chance encounters with figures from each of the three godfathers' pasts, an encounter with a yakuza boss and his would be assassin who only speaks Spanish, and a visit to a gender bending night club.Tokyo Godfathers does an excellent job of presenting its characters realistically and it even manages to be fair about some of their less savory actions. The film also comes close to working on an emotional level: there are some genuinely heart-warming moments but they are presented so quickly that their impact is lessened. Ultimately, this film has a few too many unlikely plot contrivances that go by a little too fast for it to be a great one but it works well enough often enough to make the film better than average.",

            "content": "I've had to work on Christmas day four times in five years. So you can imagine that while I'm totally and advocate for merriment and good will towards man, I do have a bit of a humbug up my butt when it comes to the season. Your memories of Christmas might entail opening presents by the tree, mine has to deal with you and your family in the afternoon, trying to find the best combination of food items that will keep your kids happy and your wallet full (can't happen by the way). Then as you leave, I have to clean up the mess. Yet \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" is still a beautiful song and there are plenty of movies that warm the cockles of my heart when the holidays come around.I can go through the gambit of classic holiday films, each of which conjures memories. One of the few traditions my family had was watching A Christmas Story (1983) on Christmas Day. While many appreciate or rather celebrate holiday snark with neo-classics like Bad Santa (2003), National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989) is still a staple of holiday cynicism for yours truly. And of course for unbridled Christmas spirit you can't go wrong with the occasionally corny Love Actually (2003) or the genuine Joyeux Noel (2005).I didn't think it would be possible to surprise when it came to Christmas films but I recently sat down to watch Tokyo Godfathers (2003) and had my inner pessimist silenced for a an hour an a half. The movie sets up our three protagonists: Gin, a cynical hard drinking loner, Hana, an interminably happy transvestite and Miyuki, a teenage runaway. All three live on the streets of Tokyo and scrounge up a living collecting bottles and making the rounds to the soup kitchens. On Christmas Eve while rummaging they find a baby in a garbage heap. Gin wants to go straight to the police while Hana wants to keep it. The three ultimately decide to find the parents and go on an adventure across the city involving crime syndicates, burlesque clubs and fateful coincidences.Throughout the night, we as the audience slowly discover the reasons for the trio's current state. They are lost souls redeemed by their mission and each must come face to face with their myriad of issues. We sympathize with their loneliness and revel in their joy when the mismatched heroes become a makeshift family. All while of course enjoying the arguments, the fights and the jests. It is after all an animated movie.The hand-drawn animation of Tokyo Godfathers is incredibly well detailed. The visage of a bustling city with so many moving parts is something to admire in a live action movie. In an animated movie, the detail is a downright miracle that likely took years, or an army of animators to make. The fact that principle story takes place in Tokyo's neon evenings creates a contemporary setting that is almost never seen in the works of Hayao Miyazaki who creates his own, new worlds instead of expanding the old. The effect is elating.In fact, outside of Hayao Miyazaki, I'm not too familiar with anime as a subgenre of animation. I am appreciative of their contributions to animation and storytelling in general and I applaud any cartoons that introduce adult themes. Still, the cultural differences are a bit to overcome when you consider Americans have a slightly different definition of spirits and a skewed impression of what's funny. Still there are very few anime movies or shows that I have seen and don't at least place value in.Tokyo Godfathers is in my opinion, a valuable cultural masterpiece. Despite adult subject matter, it is a luminous film for family audiences that has more to say about the good of human nature than say A Christmas Story, Bad Santa or even It's a Wonderful Life (1946). Unlike those films, which drown you in nostalgia or confounds with snark, Tokyo Godfather brings you into a bleak world to show you how much light there is if you only look.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",

Sadly, the film was not added to the IMDb until months later, so I've had to sit on my comments for some time.I'm a big fan of director Satoshi Kon. Both of his previous films feature stories and issues not normally seen in animated films. \"Godfathers\" continues this happy trend and goes even further by covering subjects not normally associated with Japan, period. Homelessness, immigrants, and homosexuality all play key elements in this tale.Perhaps the biggest difference here is the comedy, something Kon's previous films did not approach. \"Perfect Blue\" was a dark thriller and \"Sennen Joy\u00fb\" was more of a tearjerker. \"Godfathers\" is played for laughs, which for me weakened the movie a little bit. Some of the more outrageous moments made the other theatergoers crack up, but I felt it was a little too silly at times.While I would describe \"T\u00f4ky\u00f4 Godfathers\" as the weakest of Kon's three films to date, that's hardly a knock since his first two are among my favorites. \"Godfathers\" was just missing something, but I still openly recommend it to anyone, regardless of your disposition towards anime.",

            "content": "In continuing my trip into the late Satoshi Kon's all-too-small body of work (four feature films as director and one television series that is MUCH too hard to track down), I now come across this film, 2003's Tokyo Godfathers, which I unfortunately missed when it was first released and was actually the first time I had heard of the director.I was happy to finally come across a copy and pop it in... only to find that it was not at all what I was expecting from the director of such mind-benders as Perfect Blue and Paprika. This is both good and not-so-good. It's certainly not a bad film, nor one that is distasteful. It's a sentimental piece of pap that has the ambition to the Japanese anime answer to It's a Wonderful Life: a Christmas story that is not necessarily all about Christmas that has supernatural (or \"miracle\") overtones, and goes sometimes into dark places.The short of it: three homeless people, one a bearded guy with a family that he left behind, a transvestite who insists on being called a woman's name and is so flamboyant as to make Harvey Fierstein jealous, and a young runaway girl whose father is a cop. They come across a baby abandoned in a dump where they dwell at night, and decide to take it to the police... well, not unanimously anyway, the transvestite wants to hold on to it and mother it. But they come across some hijinks and problems along the way, including the woman who comes back to find the baby again.I could go on about the plot, but it should only be the short of it not so that I'll reveal anything so surprising, but there is TOO much to try and reveal in a plot synopsis. Like many anime films and series I can think of (on the action-side Dragonball Z and on the more adult side Princess Mononoke), the story can get complicated, if not impossible to follow. In this case though it's a holiday family film (yes, family film, despite its dark corridors its meant for ma and pa and the kids sitting around the fire), and in the last fifteen minutes or so complications, coincidences and/or contrivances get piled on, leading up to a big chase scene up a building.This would all be fine if the film itself didn't become so sentimental. It's hard to take that in Hollywood movies, but with Kon, and he has the best intentions believe me, it becomes a tale so squishy that you can feel it slipping from your fingers. It is pap, but not the kind of enjoyable pap that the original John Ford entertainer 3 Godfathers was back in 1948 (same premise, three men and a baby, but with the Duke in one of his best performances, but I digress it's good). Here the characters end up being more of service to Kon's 'Wonderful Life' tale, yet this does come after some time developing them. We get back-story, and later some contradiction to the back-story, and some visual aids such as a flashback to the transvestite's story as a singer who got in to a big fight with a heckler.Sure, the film has beautiful animation. Kon is one of the forerunners of Miyazaki as one of the greats in his time of modern anime in Japan, changing the game and surprising at many turns. At the least Tokyo Godfathers is pretty to look at, a kind of urban fairy tale with lots of snow and harder-edged buildings and grit, with some blasts of big humor and some deserved heart. If only the story didn't sink into its sappy moments so much - though for some this will be just the thing that will take them in, and I can't blame them. Perhaps it's the Grinch in me.",

I know things that I have thought in the past are:They are drug addicts Veterans who have been wronged Good-for-nothing bums \"Tokyo Godfathers\" was co-directed by Satoshi Kon, \"Millenium Actress\" and \"Paprika,\" and Shogo Furuya, Animator Director of \"Millenium Actress\" and \"Spirited Away.\" It deals with three hobos who find a baby abandoned in the trash bins and the mishaps and adventures they have in trying to find the baby's mother. The three of them are as different as you can imagine. One is a man, a girl, and a transvestite. We discover their stories and dreams during the search, and how the baby brings them all luck and hope in different ways.I think that all parents should sit down with their children and watch this movie. It will teach them that you shouldn't be so quick to label people and be judgmental about their lives. Also, that they always have a chance to turn things around. Everyone is going to make mistakes in life because as we all know, no one is perfect. The people who don't give up and try to make up for these mishaps are the ones who are the real winners. This movie represents this and makes you feel positive that you can always be reborn. As that saying goes, \"You can sleep when you're dead.\"Another reason that I loved the film is that it showed that if someone really loves you, he/she will always forgive you. In the end, life is about second chances and forgiveness. You will not hold grudges for the rest of your life when you love because as another of my favorite saying goes, \"Love is never having to say you're sorry.\"The movie showed great life lessons in a way that children and adults alike could enjoy. My children and I laughed throughout the movie and never wondered when it would be over. It's definitely a movie that I would add to my collection of treasured films.",

            "content": "\"Tokyo Godfathers\" or \"T\u00f4ky\u00f4 goddof\u00e2z\u00e2zu\" (kinda funny translation) is a Japanese award-winning animated movie from 2003, so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year and that makes it a bit sad to see that the two people who created this one are dead and gone already. The big name behind the project is Satoshi Kon and he died over a decade ago already, quite a bit under the age of 50. He was the writer and director here and it was not his last film for the big screen (that would be \"Paprika\"), but his penultimate movie if you want to call it that. Kon's co-writer here was Keiko Nobumoto, who has worked on another classic (\"Akira\") in a less important position, but here she really contributed a lot. She died in December 2021 a few years before her 60th birthday, so she basically became a decade older than Kon, but still did not reach a really old age. The base story was created early in the 20th century from what I learned today and comes from America originally. There is nothing particularly American about this one here though. Anime through and through really. This is not a very long film: It crosses the 1.5-hour mark, but only does so during the closing credits. For pretty much the entire film you could wonder why they are called Godfathers, but in the end there is the explanation and it was a pretty sweet revelation. I could hear several \"ooohs\" from the crowd, especially the female viewers because this revelation added some decent heart to the story and also rewarded those otherwise unfortunate protagonists. They went through so much in their lives. But before I get to the plot and talk a bit more about the story, let me say that I cannot elaborate on the voice actors. I watched the film with the original Japanese-language audio (and English subtitles), but I am not familiar with the cast. As much as I can be a judge there, the voices sounded adequate and fit the characters.It was no coincidence that this film aired four days before Christmas at a movie theater again because this is somewhat Christmas-themed. It was funny to listen to a really familiar Christmas tune in the Japanese language at the very start. At the end, namely during the closing credits, we then hear a very famous classical tune that usually does not come with vocals, but here it did and it was a fairly funny rendition. So the music, also away from the soundtrack, is already a success here. The story is fine too. We have three homeless characters. One is a man, another is a woman and the third is something in-between. From this perspective, you can also say that this is a fairly progressive film for its time as it shows us a man in woman's clothing as one of the key characters and (s)he is maybe the most likable character you will find in this movie. The three title characters are all pretty much likable in their own right though, even if they lie about their wife and daughter being deceased, but at least in the end they admit it was a lie. You could say that one story of a homeless man in here is basically a father-daughter story told from the older one's perspective while the homeless female's background is a father-daughter story told from the woman's point of view. Those do have parallels. And as for the third character, he did not have his biological mother take good care of him, so he basically grew up with the help of another character between male and female and there is also a heartfelt reunion between these two. But despite all these complicated lives and personal backgrounds, the core story in this film is connected to a seemingly abandoned baby that the trio finds in the snow. So they take care of it until they find the baby's mother or who they mistake for the baby's mother. Eventually, there is a real happy ending though when the kid is reunited with the actual parents and the three are picked as the baby's godfathers. The woman who lied about being the mother has her own tragic fate however. So you cannot really be too mad at her ether for this lie and abduction because she clearly needs psychological support. You can maybe be a bit mad at her for trying to kill not only herself, but also almost kill the baby this way. In the end, they both survive.Really many people survived from dangerous situations. Take the guy who takes three gunshots to his belly/chest. Now that is almost a miracle. Take the woman and daughter linked to the male protagonist that we thought were both dead. Take said male protagonist himself who ends up in a really dangerous, kind of life-threatening situation even if he loses conscience during these temperatures, take the shemale who ends up in hospital towards the end. They also all recover so quickly that it maybe did not feel too realistic. Another aspect that did not feel too realistic in this film was the element of unlikely events happening all the time. I will just list a few. The female title character seeing her father in the train. Said character running into her father again at the very end in the hospital. The trio finding the baby in the first place. The male title character running into his daughter at the emm.. hospital again? The gang being there at the same place where this assassination attempt happens, one that would normally be in the news for days if not weeks. The trio, especially the male/female character running into the driver again when they are about to chase down the pretender. There is probably more. Oh yes, there is. I forgot the truck that crashes into the building when they had just moved outside. What are the chances? So yeah, you will surely find flaws with this film if you take a closer look here. And not just a few. What I just mentioned is also a bit disappointing because in general you can say that, unlike other works by Kon, this film is intended to be realistic and without supernatural elements. Some of these scenes also result in comedic moments. Like with all animes, even the more dramatic ones, there are segments and inclusions that will make you laugh. The first comment the male/female character makes towards this driver was kinda funny. Another moment linked to him/her that is about being abandoned was hilarious too when another character (that we know nothing about) agrees with this statement, but does not realize it was not even meant to describe his character at all.I will mention more moments that made me and/or other audience members smile or even laugh: The fight sequence between the male and female protagonists before they find the baby was funny. What they say to each other. The moment when one character suspects another character to be dead and how (s)he reacts when (s)he sees it is another character instead was also kinda funny. The male protagonist finally grabbing a bike as if he was indeed a cyclist and also handling a few situations as if he was indeed an action film hero was kinda nice. The dying man I just mentioned grabbing the bottle one last time before he departs was also supposed to take some emotional gravity out of this scene. One inclusion of the famous \"Ode to Joy\" (\"Freude, sch\u00f6ner G\u00f6tterfunken\") in a very exaggerated manner brought some laughs. In general, exaggeration was something that was the basis for a lot of the comedy here. Or take the moment when they run again into the driver or chauffeur from early on. Or one of my favorite moments was when they are near a graveyard and the male protagonist says something how he is not dead yet. So there was also some dark comedy in here. You do not have to wait for the next laugh for a long time. It always comes pretty quickly, even if I understand why most would not categorize this as a comedy film. Some of the other contents are just too serious for that. But still, it is a film that will also win you over maybe during the moments when it puts a smile on your lips. Maybe those were even better written than the drama attached to the film as a whole.And there was a lot of drama for sure. I already mentioned many twists in here. One inclusion I did not get at all was the assassination attempt I talked about early on. Apparently, it was linked in a way to gang crime and I can see why it was included plot-wise, namely to get the baby (and the female protagonist) to a woman who could give actual breast milk to the baby and also in terms of the male protagonist that he understands it is not (only) the man to blame there who gets hit by the bullets. Not the (only) one to blame for the protagonist's messed-up life. He realizes this in the end and lets go, but when he sees him again for the first time, he is really ready to kill him himself before it all escalates with the murder attempt that actually shows us how this allegedly bad and ruthless guy is totally ready to risk his own life to save the life of the man he is obliged to protect. So now he is a real professional still (or again), but in a totally positive sense this time. Anyway, this plot then totally vanishing from the film left me a bit confused. Oh yeah, another somewhat funny moment was when the male/female character slapped the woman who wanted to take the baby from her and at this point they did not know yet she was a fraud. So looking back at what we know now, we cannot be too mad at the shemale for hitting her then I suppose. Of course, it was also in a way sweet in terms of this between-the-genders character's mother instinct and actually she was not too different then from the fake mother, with the exception of course that the latter was more damaged because of her loss. And also hurt others more as a consequence, namely the real parents. I am personally glad I watched this film today and that I could go see it on the big screen. I was also glad to see the really large theater pretty packed and so many seats taken. Old films keep attracting big audiences and will do so for a long time. I would not say this was a great film, but a good one that is worth a watch, especially during the holidays. Thumbs-up.",

The spirit of Christmas drives them to pick her up and the rest of the movie details their journey to find the parents of the little tyke.This might very well be the most down to earth movie director Satoshi Kon has ever made, which is saying a lot about his usual fare. It contains no supernatural elements, no crazy trips into the cracking psyche of man, nothing really out of the ordinary. Yet it is strange enough so as to be recognizable. The plot relies heavily on happy coincidences, but often enough those coincidences are so out there that they have to be intentional, making the seeming laziness of the script into a stylish feature. I certainly had no complaints, the whole story was a blast to follow, especially because you really couldn't predict where it was going.But, beneath all the craziness and oddness, Tokyo Godfathers is a character film and it pulls it off fantastically. All three of the eponymous \"godfathers\" are deeply layered, tragic, funny and, beyond all else, interesting personalities. Each one is as different from one another as day is from night, yet you can see what pulls them together. They're as interesting separately as they are in a group, but it's the group that drives the individuals to do pretty much anything. I was actually sad to see the film end, because it meant saying goodbye.Tokyo Godfathers is an excellent film on many levels. It is a superb animated film, fantastic characters study and actually a pretty neat Christmas film as well. Definitely worth checking out.",

            "content": "I've never been a really huge fan of Japanese animation, but Satoshi Kon's Paprika, shown here in last year's Animation Nation festival, is a different story, and opened up my eyes altogether. It was richly animated with plenty of striking details, an eclectic soundtrack, and a story which cuts at many levels. It's adult, not filled with cutesy pictures for the sake of luring kids in, but yet filled with a childlike appeal in its entire work. And I've taken the first step into watching more of his works.Tokyo Godfathers retains much of the very sharp, detailed animation, and certainly some scenes looked photo quality. While Paprika was rooted with more science-fictional elements and dream sequences, Tokyo Godfathers has a relatively more down to earth premise, taking a hard look at the lives of the homeless in shiny Tokyo. Set in the Christmas period, it's full of dark elements in the holiday season, yet filled with plenty of hope and goodwill as we see the characters develop and the plot unfold.The story centers around three homeless folks - Gin (Toru Emori) the middle aged drunk gambler bum, Hana (Yoshiaki Umegaki) the transvestite, and Miyuki (Aya Okamoto), the youngest of the lot, a girl who ran away from home. One day during their usual bickering, they discovered an abandoned female infant, whom they named Kiyoko, in a garbage dump. Reluctantly, they endeavoour to track down the infant's parents to return the baby, as well as to give them a stern reprimand for doing their dastardly deed over the season of goodwill. And thus their road trip in and around Tokyo begins.What holds your attention, is the way our trio encounters mini episodes of adventure in their quest, ranging from meeting up with a real Godfather, to slowly unravelling their back stories, which I find both touching and believable, and more so for an animated picture. The craft in the narrative is superb, which you can enjoy at face value, or if you bother, to dig below the surface and discover such joys in its detailed story. It doesn't have to explain everything, and allows you to draw your own conclusions at certain points.And I can't stress enough at the attention to details. Be it conversational dialogue, an object, a supporting character, or the backgrounds, you can't imagine at how they all blend together effortlessly to elicit such joy when you realize that you've uncovered something of some significance, or was put there just for laughs. With such care put into the movie, I can't help but to recommend this, and for myself to continue my own quest in tracking down and watching the rest of Satoshi Kon's animated movies.Code 1 DVD contains minimal extras. There are plenty of preview trailers though, for movies such as Astro Boy, Cowboy Bebop The Movie, Cyborg 009, Memories, Metropolis, Returner, Steamboy, and even one for Tokyo Godfathers itself.The only other extra is a 22 minute making of featurette, which included shots from its New York premiere, as well as interviews with Satoshi Kon, and the principle cast sharing their experience in lending their voices to an animated movie. Subtitles are available in English, Spanish and Portuguese for the movie and the making of featurette, but the French subtitles are available for the movie only.",

Specially when it's Christmas time and every one else is at home enjoying their Christmas while our trio is risking their lives for one baby.The movie isn't dubbed like other anime. Just Japanese and subtitles. Which is fine since that way people wouldn't argue about the differences between Dub and sub.The humor in it is mild, there's violence, plenty of adult theme, and a couple of visible view of the female breast. So as you might already can tell it's an anime for mature audiences. So try to keep this away from 13 and under.But I highly recommend it to die hard Anime and Japan fans.

So this movie features three homeless people who find an infant and try to find her parents. That's really all there is and all there needs to be. The weirdest thing is that I heard that Japan is actually the least religious country on Earth. Well, maybe not the least but two thirds of its population are not religious.It's not like this doesn't contain any references to the baby Jesus. It explicitly mentions him at the beginning of the story through a play. I think it's great that such a secular country can look into the religious themes of a holiday. I thought Christmas in Japan had something to do with KFC. Did I miss that in this movie? I am glad the movie was rated PG-13. There was a scene where a woman was breast feeding two babies at once. Another breastfeeding scene appeared later.You'd think with any bare breasts that much, a movie would be rated R. I'm glad the MPAA understood that breastfeeding is something perfectly natural. What's so beautiful about this film is the gorgeous animation. I think this might be the most realistic anime film I've ever seen. It may also be the only one that wasn't based on a manga or directed by Miyazaki. It's great that other artists are learning to create anime masterpieces. ****",

I enjoyed each character's own story-lines and how they were interwoven and brought together. (spoiler) One loose end that was never brought up though was the old-man who died, what was his identity? Thought they would fill that in. The ending was very well and contained a great \"wow\" moment that might've been a bit over the top but nonetheless fitting.",

It was really sad to think the three were homeless because of being in debt, the drag queens partner dying and the girl accidentally stabbing her father as she thought he stabbed the cat to death but turned out he didn't. Poverty is still unfortunately lingering today and this doesn't have to be set in Japan to establish this.I was so thrilled in the end that they got the baby back from that poor girl who lost her own child and that they found the real parents. I also was actually very near to tears that the three were going to become godparents to the child. I really wish we could see their reaction and also when the baba was baptized. So frustrated that it ended abruptly that way but I am really expecting a sequel right now lol.Great film, very emotional and added reality in it! Also the Japanese Sub voice actors were excellent too!",

One is always aware of where the director's plot is going, few moments surprise, moments of pathos feel far too calculated, Satoshi offers no real insights into homelessness and his visuals are mostly generic. Elsewhere the usual Christmas values are espoused - family, love, kindness, friendship, don't stab your father \u2013 though Satoshi undermines them all with a bit more grit and grime than is typical of the genre (one of our heroes, for example, is a transsexual).

The film recounts their journey through the city as they search for the little girl's mother.This animated feature is indeed lovely to look at, capturing the stark beauty of its snowy urban landscape in finely drawn detail.  The story, however, steeped in sentimentality and riddled with coincidence, plays like a third-rate Dickens melodrama, minus the richness of character and subtlety of wit the Master would have brought to the task.  The three main characters aren't particularly interesting, and the story, such as it is, is tedious, unfocused and rambling.  I guess there has to be a reason for a story to be done in animated form, but `Tokyo Godfathers' fails to provide us with that reason.

Agreeing to this, my dad said that we could all watch a DVD he recently picked up.Never having told my dad that my friends favourite film is Perfect Blue ( 1997-also reviewed), I was left speechless, when my dad revealed the movie he had in mind for us to watch, was a Satoshi Kon work,that my friend has been wanting to see for ages, leading to us meeting the godfathers.View on the film:Examining the lead characters in Perfect Blue and Paprika (1997 and 2006-both also reviewed) having doubts over their perception of reality, co-writer (with Keiko Nobumoto) / directing auteur Satoshi Kon masterfully explores the perception of family, with Gin, Hanna and Miyuki all coming from broken homes, where they pick up the broken pieces, and build a new home/family with each other.Set over the Christmas holidays with three homeless people, rather then three wise men, the screenplay by Kon and Nobumoto superbly have a Christmas miracle , via the trio finding an abandoned new born baby just after they had watched children perform the nativity scene.Taking the caring of the baby to heart, the arrival of the bundle of joy into their lives, leads to the trio exploring the differing perceptions of their relationships they each hold, from Hana's romantic view of Gin, being at odds with his more platonic gaze,while teenage Miyuki comes to see Gin and Hana as her parents, after a altercation/ stabbing her dad (stabbings being a recurring motif in Kon's works), leaving Miyuki as a runaway.Bringing his distinctive surrealism under the Christmas tree in Gin and the baby heavenly coming back down to earth in the final moments, director Kon & cinematographer Katsutoshi Sugai (who would later do the TV series Paranoia Agent with Kon), spend the holiday season down in Tokyo with beautiful, shaded colours emphasizing the tough living conditions of Miyuki, Hana and Gin, who Kon draws together merrily with spellbinding, detailed 2D animation, with a real care displayed in close-ups on the refined facial features, of the Tokyo godfathers.",

            "content": "'Tokyo Godfathers (2003)' is a rare example of a farcical drama, feeling fairly close to the work of Pedro Almod\u00f3var in terms of its blurred line between melodrama and comedy and its overt reliance on coincidence (or maybe I should say Christmas miracles). Satoshi Kon's third animated outing tells the tale of three homeless friends who find a baby abandoned on the street and set out to find its mother. This simple setup leads to all sorts of misadventure, with the focal characters intersecting with figures from their past and coming across strange occurrences which seem to imply their newfound friend has a guardian upstairs. As I mentioned earlier, the film is actually a farcical drama, maintaining a strong emotional undercurrent and keeping its focus on its characters even when it is at its weirdest and wildest. The farce doesn't always equate to comedy, though there are moments of genuine humour sprinkled throughout the brisk narrative, and the affair isn't afraid to get sombre or dark when it needs to. It's a really satisfying affair in terms of story. It's also really satisfying in terms of animation. Though conveying life through still drawings is a staple of the entire medium, few similar efforts manage to communicate as much vitality and energy as this one. It's all rather chaotic, actually, but you soon settle into its fast-paced and off-kilter rhythm to just enjoy the ride. While most of the movie seems grounded and relatively realistic from afar, on closer inspection it is evident that everything from the smallest facial expression to the broadest of gestures is exaggerated beyond what's possible in live-action land. Ironically, though, this is what makes the flick feels as true to life as it does; it deals with a kind of unreality that somehow makes its emotion feel all the more real. There's a surprising amount of nuance and depth here, especially when it comes to the beaten-down yet colourful characters at its core. It's an affecting experience that's also just really entertaining. It's worth noting that the feature is fairly good when it comes to the representation of its trans character, Hana. Though it occasionally pokes fun at her expense, it's notably progressive overall. That's primarily because it never undermines her identity (even if some of its characters do) and it treats her as a complex character who's every bit as important and well-realised as the cisgender members of her found family. I could have done without some of the homophobic and transphobic language, but it's certainly ahead-of-its time for a film that's very nearly 20 years old and seems markedly positive overall. Ultimately, this is a ton of fun. It's visually stunning, effortlessly energetic, surprisingly affecting and undeniably enjoyable. It's a really good effort, further proving that Kon was a master of his craft.",

            "content": "I will admit right at the start, I'm not a big fan of subtitled anime. I always prefer to watch with an English dub track, unless the dub is really bad. I prefer to watch what is happening on the screen rather than having to constantly flick between the picture and the words.For this reason, I put off watching Tokyo Godfathers for a long time. I had seen Satoshi Kon's other releases. I found Perfect Blue very uncomfortable to watch. Millennium Actress used clever storytelling but I felt a bit too distant from the story itself (I suspect this was because there were a lot of Japanese cultural and historical references in it). Then I found Paranoia Agent and thought it was excellent (despite the strange ending). In the end I bit the bullet and watched Tokyo Godfathers and wished I hadn't put it off for so long.The story may be a little unconventional, both for anime films and also Christmas films, but Kon makes it work. This film will certainly go on my \"must watch at Christmas\" list, along with Nightmare Before Christmas (another unconventional animated Christmas film).Some reviewers have criticised the number of coincidences that occur in the story, but personally I feel that the viewer can interpret this however they want to. If you believe in a higher power you can take the numerous references to 12-25 and the event that saves Hana as an indication that a higher power is pulling the strings. If you don't believe in such things, you can take it as serendipity or just a story with several happy endings.The film itself is a little different from Kon's other works. It doesn't try to blur the line between fantasy and reality (except for one short dream sequence). Despite the subject matter (three homeless people) it's actually a pretty happy film on the whole, with only a couple of slightly unpleasant scenes. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, it'll make you go \"awww\".I do still hope that one day this film will be re-released with an English dub track. But even with subtitles the dialogue moves slow enough that you can take in the film and the subtitles without feeling you're having to rush your reading or that you're missing some beautiful visuals.I am now eagerly awaiting seeing Kon's next film - Paprika.",

            "content": "A John Wayne film from 1946 gives us the initial thrust of plot, three homeless bums discover a baby in the trash and take it upon themselves to deal with it. It's a film so full of coincidence and magic happenstance, the kind of which produces oddball but heartwarming scenarios for characters not ready to deal with the, yet at the same time it doesn't ever ring false because it's about miracles of life and miracles are only false if we don't believe in them. I'm not generally taken in by animation but Satoshi Kon does some amazing things here, the atmosphere of Christmas in a country that celebrates it only passingly is unique, the streets are empty and there's a faint bell going off in a Shinto temple somewhere in the dark, and the painted faces emote like real people, they pout and scowl and snarl like real people do. And I loved Miss Hana/Uncle 'Bag', she's one of the most interesting characters of the decade I think, a woman born a man who takes the part of both mother and wife but repudiates her roles as both in search of family. The film is trying to make us 'feel' Christmas, it wants us to not be the cynic onlooker who observes plot contrivance but rather be conflated with the contrivance so that it becomes meaningful. This should be one of the great Christmas movies, where things are bitter funny and snow whirls under the lamp posts of cold empty streets, then they're sad and faith-restoring but we know it's all a feelgood fantasy that says 'everything will be alright'. I like how Satoshi Kon injects complex human behaviour here, one of the protagonists is in drag, another takes us in through a weepy personal story which is later revealed to be the complete fabrication of a cowardly man, the girl is like a cipher of teenage rebellion, stabbing her father seemingly over a cat.",

While childish in many ways it touched on quite adult issues in others. Homelessness and the various reasons for it, Japanese healthcare, Yakuza, Immigrants, Drugs, Violence in its many facettes and, as always in Satoshi Kons movies till now, the human psyche. While many of those issues are only touched briefly (including psychology), it seems like the director wanted to show a crossover through society. Thus the movie is quite packed, and thus the movie is quite entertaining to say the least. Strangely enough though, no sex whatsoever.The characters were unique in their own way and believable on the stage the movie provided. The character animation was OK. We've all seen better, but with this movie that's hardly the point. Satoshi Kon definitely overused the deus ex machina in this one, but then again he always does (altough I still have to see Paranoia Agent), so I was expecting it. Plus he always does it in such unpretentious ways that I can simply enjoy it. So what? Coincidences DO happen. Especially on Christmas. ^^ I wouldn't want to exchange the end of this movie for anything more believable, its just to... fitting.In short I could find nothing wrong with this movie. While it didn't get me thinking, it certainly entertained me from start to finish. Well... I didn't care for the dancing skyscrapers.8/10One other thing though. I'm utterly sick of hearing comparisons to Miyazaki. It's like fanboys comparing every Fantasymovie or book with LotR. Seriously, HOW, can anyone compare this movie, or even more, something like Perfect Blue with Totoro, Chihiro or Laputa? What mindbending techniques are necessary to accomplish this task, I ask you? Comparing Miyazaki with Kon is like comparing Spielberg with del Toro. They just make different kinds of movies. Miyazaki and Kon are both terribly talented Directors and writers, they both make brilliant movies and they both happen to work in Japan. The End",

They don't have much to go on, but determine to painstakingly follow what little clues they have in the hope that they can identify the mother of this pitiful bundle. Along the way, we find ourselves in a semi-comical environment as the three make progress - almost despite themselves. Confused, yes? Muddled? Yes, that too - but the sum of the three individuals proves to be worth far more than the value of each part. They function as a team because they shouldn't - and that is where much of the humour and the potency of the drama comes from. The animation is stylish and the hues and shades are particularly effective at illustrating their environment and at complimenting the humorous elements of their detective work. For some, 2022 attitudes may show up some of the character cracks that would have been groundbreaking at the start of this new millennium, but given it was made when it was - it tackles quite a few issues with a candour - and vivacity - that all works well to create an entertaining, charming and at times just a little thought-provoking animation.",

One of the main characteristics of this film is that it's pacing is much faster than most other films, perhaps the outcome of it being animated: since each second costs 12 frames of animation it makes sense to minimize the amount of \"fat\" in the film to reduce costs and thus make a less dragging film.Highly recommended.",

            "content": "If there is one person still believing that anime is \"purely kids and naive-minded stuff\", then this movie is the one to see. Dealing with social issues of the modern Japan is already an almost unheard theme in Japanese animation and the ease this movie portraits its anti-hero and japan-lowlife protagonists is just mind-blowing.The formula of connecting three very different people together, similar to the great first \"Ice Age\", to send them on an Odyssey through adventures and finally through their own emotions works fabulous. The characters are rich on depth and complex personalities, sometimes even reminding to director-legend Akira Kurosawa's figures. The story is gripping and moving with stark and sometimes even gritty moments, which push the limit on what can be done with animation.All this praise is tarnished by the once again awful dubbing. Translating Japanese enthusiasm into English is tough, no question about that. Still i think the voice actors could have done much better. As such it's not recommendable to watch the English-dubbed version. Rather go for subtitles.Nevertheless, this movie is an important piece in anime history and once again shows that anime has to be taken as serious as a genre as real world cinema.",

            "content": "Director Satoshi Kon took his inspiration, and part of his title, from Jon Ford's western 3 Godfathers (1948), in which three rough and ready outlaws find themselves caring for a baby. At heart it's a Christmas card to Tokyo, and expression of good will and a reminder to spread a little kindness in a world that is increasingly cold and intolerant. The film mixes comedy, drama, pathos and action. There are, of course, Christmas references galore. There are also references to a Tokyo many anime fans may find as incredible as Santa Claus. Kon reminds us this is no fairyland, but a real, living city with 21st century problems that no robot army can solve - shanty towns, tramps scavenging in graveyards, predatory teenagers beating up old men, and illegal immigrants scraping a living in the black economy. Above all else, though, there's a happy ending, without which no Christmas film could possibly be a Christmas film. It comes, not from any flashy bit of magic, but from the everyday miracles in the hearts of ordinary people whose humanity redeems their failings. Kon captures the beguiling neon glow of Tokyo in the film's many night scenes, turning the city into a magical setting for a tale of Christmas miracles.",

            "content": "Tokyo Godfathers is the story of three 'bums' and an almost supernaturally lucky baby. it has obvious parallels with the Western story of the three wise men and Jesus, but in this case Jesus is a girl. The bums are also far from wise but are, however, totally dedicated to the plight of the infant they find one evening, abandoned in the rubbish heap. The film follows their quest to reunite parents and child.What lifts this film into magical territory is that the lives of each of these homeless people would make personal day-to-day survival for most of us testing enough, without having to consider the continual needs of a baby. But in the end, this quest is what binds them together and gives each of their lives some meaning. Their personal stories unravel and are explained individually through flashbacks and chance encounters. Although the story is often carried along by inexplicable coincidence, it is tightly plotted and does not suffer from clunky dialogue or too much sentimentality (as can sometimes negatively affect Japanese films in my experience) -- in fact, the dialogue is superb throughout and often very funny.The music and drawing style are wonderful and the life of early 21st Century Tokyo is perfectly captured in the cityscape. The cold and often snowy plazas, streets, alleys and graveyards make for a fittingly inhospitable backdrop, which is at the same time imbued with a serene beauty. Also, the complete history of Japanese art seems to have been injected into the face of homeless transvestite, Hana, whose sudden and dramatic emotional outbursts are some of the highlights of the film. This is one of my absolute favourite films to watch around Christmas time and has my highest recommendation as an antidote to the usual CGI-heavy stuff that seems to be available these days. It has everything that makes a good adventure story, and depth and detail enough to reward re-watching. I've seen it three times now and it gets better every time.",

            "content": "The most striking aspect of Satoshi Kon's well-regarded 2003 anime feature is the fact, that the script could have easily been a live action. In fact, the story may be hindered slightly by anime format and certainly derives no benefit from it. To be fair, Kon's animators do an excellent job of using broad kabuki facial expressions to express the various emotions the characters encounter during a wildly improbable set of Christmas Day events. They also render the dark complexity of the Tokyo underground and its forgotten homeless population (Japan's legendary low unemployment rate is helped by not including people without a permanent, legal address in the statistics) with a fearful realism. Kon's production team does render the plot-driven character development that unfolds frame by frame throughout the film with the pathos of a Tennessee Williams' play. So you can't fault the execution of the animation, it just seems unnecessary. Live action or anime, however, the story of two homeless men \u2013 one transgender \u2013 and a runaway who find a baby abandoned among some Tokyo garbage and their effort to unravel the mystery of its parentage plays as compellingly backwards as it does forwards. In the effort to return the baby to the rightful parents, both men are forced to confront their pasts and their own allegorical abandonments. While the plot twists defy even the best efforts at suspending disbelief, they are entertaining even if some allow the mechanics of the writing to show through. In short, see this satisfying tale for the compelling story even if you are not into Japanese anime and definitely don't wait for the inevitable American remake (Nathan Lane as \"Uncle Bag\", Abigail Breslin as Miyuki, etc.).",

I had a review about it and I thought it sounded intriguing. It was, and much more.The tagline (in English, at least) is \"Meet the ultimate dysfunctional family.\" It's brilliant and accurate. A trio of homeless misfits find a baby in a pile of garbage. Despite their own personal misfortunes, they decide they must take care of the baby... and, as the story progresses, find its parents. This takes them on a journey throughout Tokyo in which we discover how they ended up in the situation they did. The animation at first did not strike me as great. But as I got hooked into the story, I realized how brilliant it was. The animators accurately captured hundreds of facial expressions, so much so that you could easily empathize with any of the characters in the film.At first I was put off by the constant yelling and screaming among the trio. I hear this all the time in Japanese TV, where directors obviously believe that by having characters scream at each other in one-note angry voices, they are creating \"drama.\" Since I didn't really know where the story was going, I just thought, \"Okay, a typical Japanese drama with excessive screaming.\" But as the story continued, there were numerous shades to each of the performances and you could see that this homeless trio were very rich in backstory.Some story details were unclear. Some moments were predictable or way, way too convenient. Also, even though I watched the film with subtitles, it was completely unclear to me why it was necessary to have a foreign couple in the film for a brief period of time since it did not help the story in any particular way. That said, it did allow for one hysterically funny moment in which the young female member of the trio utilizes the only four words of English that she knows.I forgave the predictability and the screaming, because there was a lot of legitimate drama and action and laughs and gasps and tears. It was an enjoyable experience and I will watch it again in the future. Not perfect, but still, enjoyable.",

It is so well written and directed that it always saddens me when I think that this guy only had four feature films to his name (and look at the quality of each of his films!) having died way to soon. That true life sad story just amplifies some of the bittersweetness that this movie conveys as any good Christmas movie should. The true miracle of this movie is the writing though, as all of its characters are just incredibly well developed, each having its flaws and qualities but all very relatable making you always root for them. Very well done indeed. The animation is also very beautiful even if it's a bit dated. Tremendous work from one of the best anime directors that left us way too soon.",

Looked up to see what I might have missed, and I was blown away by what others take away from this film.Tokyo Godfathers, about 90 mins long, is all about kindness, family (the one you're a part of by birth, and the one you have in the people you choose to be with) and about 'Christmas miracles'. There's commentary on commercialism and consumerism, on how the society can be a hard place to be a part of, very well complimented by humor and some heartwarming writing. The movie is a reminder of what's truly important during the coldest and darkest time of the year - togetherness.If you haven't watched this film, don't wait like I did.

            "content": "It is not so easy always whenever a movie is told with so many characters jumping all around. Sometimes it will feel a hangover or sometimes it gonna be a blast.During the occasion of christmas was on air, i got myself back to revisit somewhat memorylane back to Keiko Nobumoto san's and Satoshi Kon's often shrugged under the bus type of forgotten in a sense piece of art. That i think should get equal love and appreciation as all of their other works.Firstly, you might be asking why on talking about christmas eve? Because this is a christmas movie to itself while not being marketed as one but surely does the job of bringing the joy and a whole family to sit together if they want to watch such piece of art.Remember as the line goes, often we miss out on things that are important to us, sometimes we forget to cherish the love we were born with and sometimes the human heart being so soft yet so much full of emotions running around. It messes with us and it messed with our perspective to enjoy smallest of gestures and maybe in this world on a cold wintery night outside. How fortunate we are to be alive and living in the name of surviving each day and still need to find that contentment that we are always missing to ourselves.The story of 3 people different from one another to sharing a proper way of meaning to how all hells break loose when we at together to bringing misfortunes and accepting it with open arms. Acceptance is the key to open your heart sometimes. Afraid of abandonment is what chases us away far into distance. May there be a light on a lonely forest with a lampost burning inside to show us that light we may need.As for the story of Tokyo Godfathers, it is a storytelling narrative of my favourite Nobumoto san as how she brings all things together into a separate way of making me fall in love all over again with greeting a story to my heart strings as 3 different walks of character such as an Abandoned Alcoholic named Gen, a transgender person Hana and runaway girl named Miyuki are center of attention. The story takes inspiration from Once upon a time in america and Baby's day out to get into a mix of something new as a gift. Where three Homeless persons find a baby newborn and find a letter with how she was left to be taken care off by the finders in a trashbin. Kyoko was named by miyuki as she and Hana and Gen started to look for her parents.With eventual twists and turns all the way leading in a mess with the yakuzas and with finding similarities within the darkness we preserve inside us, there is always a cast of light waiting to bowl down and sigh in mercy. Kyoko a lost child who goes through this presumably journey and bringing people to reflect along the way.We see stories centering each character and their backstories, we see how well adapted and characrerized a trans character was written by Nobumoto was as Hana made me love her character the most after Miyuki as she shares her story of running away from her parents and Gen who was lost as sight and abandoned everything. Abandonment is a keyword that unites all three walks of this little family of mascaraed, whether you cherish that loneliness and learn to accept that and also tag along to not let others be left around alone is a choice not most of us can take.The movie shows, even in despair actions the three homeless persons are always there willingly to help those in need and those who can sheer welcome the cold winter outside at the streets of tokyo under that lightbulb. I love how each time we cross a sentence there is a passion of love showcasing even in abandoning there is a beauty inside all the lost souls. That is not always in a despair to find the greed or to find darkest nightmares within us to say or not to mention how even the mightiest have a soft side inside of them.Nevertheless the love and joy shared on an evening of streets at a bizarre turn of events leading upto serious topics, death and life calamity and conclusion of an epic tale to find the lost love and respect for loved ones into accepting to love ourselves and share the love to others at the sign of abandonment.So that nobody gets left behind and find a warm shoulder in those cold nights. Somewhere deep down Satoshi kon the maestro himself found a way to tell all that in just 92 minutes and showed why people miss him in todays day and age. As if a bit of light on those lonely streets got turned off. Or who has to say a piece of my heart also was lost in time just so to remember me why i had fallen in love with this sort of craftsmen ship in a long time.Because it is the endless possibilities that make us feel the need to search for hope and beautify everything that comes to us along the way. As if even the coldest nights can be full of mysteries.My suggestions, if you are free do give this movie a try if you haven't already or if you have. Give a rewatch and sit down from this restless life for a day will ya?",

The film can't decide if it wants to be melodramatic or realistic and so is filled with scenes of cornballish plot developments and splotched by serious ones (there is scene where a mobster gets shot in the head!). The film is done with too light a touch when it should pound away at the corniness and is too corny when it should earn our respect. So many critics have forgiven the films lukewarm impact for its humanism. I am all for humanism, but I must say that the jarring stereotypes of transvestites (the transvestite character is made to look like freak) make me a little reluctant to praise this humanism critics speak of.

My favorite part was when Gin said something like \"I feel like some meat.\" and he looked at a cat and Mayuki was like \"Don't you even think about it!\" and she hugged all her cats tightly. The movie of course had good themes like the main theme I think was don't look at apperences look at the inside. Like Hana, Gin and Mayuki were the most awful looking people, yet they had wonderful hearts.",

            "content": "I was pretty much deceived by this movie; I was hoping that the director could use the animation media as well as in perfect blue or millennium actress where all the characters can switch from a real to an unreal world without any sign or clues. This wasn't the case at all.This is a good movie, but not as stunning as we would expect from that director!Perfect blue left me a chocking impression that continues to flash in my head during months... Millennium actress was just a brilliant work full of beauty and touching story where time seemed to break every scene. I didn't find anything of this range in the last one. It's beautiful as it could be expected, it's a great story with a fun experience, but at the end, nothing is left to remember it! It was just too light for my huge expectations.",
