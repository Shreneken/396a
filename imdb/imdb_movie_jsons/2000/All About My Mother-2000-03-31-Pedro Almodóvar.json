            "review_title": "Almodovar's Poignant Study of Women.",
            "content": "Departing more and more from his more usual farcical style while retaining many of the elements that have made him the kind of storyteller he is today, Pedro Almodovar ended the year 2000 with a striking, passionate film that unless you had a rock for a heart you would never grasp its ultimate, compassionate essence.Manuela (Cecilia Roth) is at the center of this story, and through her unimaginable tragedy -- her son Esteban (Eloy Azorin) is killed in a freak accident while trying to get the autograph of his favorite theatre actress, Huma Rojo (played with great dignity by Spanish legend Marisa Paredes) -- she is able to reassemble the pieces of her life even though the people she encounters within her future bring her right back to her past.Almodovar films this in a completely non-exploitative way though there may be times when it feels as though it is, but being a Spanish film maker, I can see and appreciate where the growing passion reflected in many of its emotional scenes is coming from. The tragedies of these women, and of one of the more gender-confused men, all lead to that last gesture of maternal compassion, and the fact that Manuela decides to let her ex-lover Esteban, now a trans-gendered female, learn that not only did he have a son who died and loved him blindly but has another infant son borne from a nun (Penelope Cruz) is the core of what human relations are about: love which transcends errors, sex, character, even the absence of a father. A fascinating movie experience that resonates and brings the real Almodovar into the spotlight.",

            "content": "This time of the year, when we talk about movies, we have to talk about Oscar. The nominees will be announced this Tuesday, but there are already favorites in some categories. Some people still doubt that \"American Beauty\" will win as best picture- which I don't, because I think it was the best film of the decade- but almost everyone agrees that this wonderful movie \"Todo sobre mi madre\"/ \"All About My Mother\" will win as best foreign language film. And it really deserves that.I've always recognized Pedro Almod\u00f3var's talent. Most of his films are very weird and quite surreal, but sometimes I don't understand him. So I couldn't decide if I would see \"All About My Mother\" on the movies, or if I would wait for it to come out on video. It was released in Brazil last October, and only yesterday I went to see it at a local cinema. And... What did I think about it? Well... A true, true masterpiece!The story of the film is about Manuela (wonderfully played by Cecilia Roth), a nurse who works at a hospital in Madrid, Spain, and has a 17 year old son, Esteban, who doesn't know the identity of his father. On the day of his birthday, he dies in an accident and Manuela gets desperate. She reads his notes and finds out that he wanted to know at least the name of his father. So she goes back to Barcelona, where she got pregnant, trying to search for her ex-husband, but some surprises will change her life.What Almod\u00f3var makes to this movie is just incredible. He makes us cry and laugh- specially in the scenes where the transvestite Agrado is. But, in fact, the film is a deep drama, studying carefully the female universe with strength and realism, and also explaining the importance of a mother. All the main characters are very well developed and each of them has some importance in the plot. It's really amazing how Almod\u00f3var knows women so well, and how he loves and cares about them. His film is a very complex masterpiece, with some important messages and a wonderful story, and should be seen by everyone, even for the American people who don't like subtitles. But pay attention- the dialogues are fabulous!\"All About My Mother\" is surely on my Top 10 of 1999. And... let's wait for the Oscar nominees on Tuesday, but I'm sure it will be nominated, and certainly win. It's much better than last year's winner as a foreign language film, \"Life is Beautiful\", and is a serious must-see. Just do me a favor: DON'T MISS IT!Rating: 10/10",

            "content": "Very few directors, since Bunuel, Fassbinder, Lindsay Anderson and Roman Polanski, have been able to translate their own, very private universes, to the screen. That is why, it divides audiences in such a radical way.You love it or you hate it. I think, that is the final objective of an artist, to express their view, to give us their own version of the world we live in. It enriches us, it makes us more aware of the million faces of human nature. Thanks to Almodovar we're allowed to feel identified with, what we may consider, marginal characters. What a different experience is to sit through an Almodovar film and a Ron Howard film for instance. Almodovar remains, becomes part of us, Ron Howard's vanishes as we're leaving the movie theater.",

            "content": "I've watched this masterpiece by Almodovar four times.  Each time I unearth new sequences of pure unadulterated truth, beauty, and genius.  It is just a totally compelling and amazingly insightful comedy-tragedy that works on so many levels.  Cecilia Roth is an Almodovar favorite, and there's no mystery as to why this is the case.  She can express tragedy, wisdom, and an appreciation of dark humor only with her eyes and facial positioning, and express all three vividly at the same time. Her voice also is as commanding of respect as it is sexy and fragile.  Almodovar eye for visual poems of incongruity reaches a new pinnacle in this masterpiece.  First, there is the haunting by-play of darkness and light preceding Roth coming to the rescue of El Agreado.  Much later, we are treated to the brightness of the upscale restaurant Roth where Roth waits for her ex-husband Lola juxtaposed with a merciless exploration of the vast dark despair of Lola's eyes. Between these bookend-style frames, the profound dualities abound.If you see one foreign language film per year, make this your next one.",

            "review_title": "A Streetcar named Manuela...",
            "content": "Todo Sobre mi Madre seemly starts off as a portrait of devoted mother Manuela and her ambitious son, Esteban. They have an unusually close relationship and share everything with each other. The happiness abruptly turns into heart-breaking melodrama when Esteban dies in a car-accident while trying to obtain an autograph from his favorite stage-performer. Emotionally devastated, Manuela returns to Barcelona, the city she fled from 17 years ago when she was pregnant with her son. Slowly and one step at the time, our heroine regains her will to live again and she's doing this by helping others. She watches over the confused Rosa during her pregnancy, becomes the personal assistant of the depressed actress Huma (and even fills in for the part of Stella in the 'Streetcar Named Desire'-play) and rejoins her old transvestite friend Agrado. This film is about human beings and their thoughts, emotions and feelings. So don't expect an adrenalin-filled action movie that'll blow you out of your seat. More specifically, Alm\u00f3dovar puts the slightly more eccentric (prostitutes, transvestites and lesbians) members of society in the spotlights and succeeds in informing the masses that these are ordinary people, capable of hurting\u0085loving\u0085and feeling. Through the clever and sophisticated use of absolute film classics like \"All about Eve\" and - of course - \"Streetcar\", this film reflects the depth and maturity of the substance. Todo Sobre Mi Madre contains several colorful characters worth analyzing, but it's Manuela's main storyline that impresses the most. Not in the least thanks to the outstanding performance by Celicia Roth! The tears she cries are real and the agony she feels contaminates you, the viewer. Roth is a very charismatic actress who amazingly represents every mother in this world. This is the best recent Spanish film I've seen recently (aside from \"T\u00e9sis\", which is a completely different genre) and warmly recommended to everyone interested in character-driven cinema. You better watch it repeatedly to make sure you don't miss any aspect of the player's personalities. This review is dedicated to my Iberian Queen, Nisa. I probably never would have seen this film if it weren't for her",

            "content": "As this was my first Almodovar movie I didn't quite expect that much,was I ever going to be surprised.Almodovar is widely seen as the greatest Spanish cineast since Luis Bunuel,which I really like,and I must say that I concur with that.The resemblances between the two directors are also there,both use intense drama and comedy in one scene to great effect and both attack the church in a big way.TODO SOBRE MI MADRE is simply one of the best drama's I've ever seen because of it's superb acting and difficult but inventive storyline.The characters are also very well worked out. Leading lady Cecilia Roth is sensational as the mourning mother and the rest of the cast isn't any worse.The supporting roles by Penelope Cruz,Marise Paredes and especially Antonia San Juan are great.San Juan is a real time transvestite which makes it even more realistic. Almodovar caused quite a commotion with this provocative film although it never goes over the line(at least not in my taste)but you should not be old fashioned or truly religious because then it will offend you.The humor that is put in the film makes it an even better experience.The mixture of intense drama and comedy is perfect.Another brilliant addition is the great soundtrack.The mixture between harmonic classical pieces and jazzy compositions is magnificent.I can't wait to see more of Almodovar's work. 9/10 (currently number 39 in my all time top 100 list)",

It takes a lot of chutzpah for a male director to swan dive into the gulf of womanhood (I can't believe I just wrote that) and emerge with such truth, HUMAN truth. While the characters of this film seem to represent certain female archetypes, they still flow organically through the ingenious plot. Almodovar shows us that any taboo subject can be tackled without it being exploited when it is done with a compassionate heart. The sheer WARMTH of this movie is what makes it a stunning success. The performances in this film are unforgettable. Cecilia Roth is so dazzling and real, and heartbreaking. But only a genius like Almodovar can break our hearts but still give us hope.",

Manuela, the mother who at the beginning seems so in control and clinical, earnest in her love and with the best intentions for her son, is shown to be much like you and me... full of doubts, questions, a need for answers and trying to understand how her life course has brought her to the present day and made her who she is. Barcelona in winter is richly filmed and serves as a backdrop for the renewing of old satisfying friendships and the budding of new ones, happening simultaneously and somewhat unexpectedly. It rings so true. The slow realisation that we are never really complete, that it's the people we love and live with, or avoid and later regret having done so, that makes us who we are. Almodovar sees the human condition and paints it carefully in this film.",

It a world where nothing makes sense, the characters here noisily assert who they are, defiant against the world's assumptions with a bravado that simultaneously hides and reveals their own lack of certainty. The reference to gay writers, the staging and restaging of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire is more than a simple plot device. It's a subtextual plea for compassion.",

I don't know which one's better, but both are worth seeing for sure.\nPenelope Cruz, who's usually in the role of charming woman, is an average girl on this movie. Perhaps below average, as she gets pregnant from a transvestite and has a fairly crappy life in general. And the head character, Cecilia Roth as Manuela, is simply a delight to watch. Absolutely no mistakes and flaws throughout the movie, no weird scenes, and everything linked perfectly. The plot not only tells a sad story perfectly articulately, but it also puts a mirror on the lives of people from extraordinary walks of life. Not to mention it feels European to the bone, the movie is completely different from any other European, American, or Latin movie I've seen.By all means, WATCH IT! Absolutely a piece to be added to your DVD collection. 10/10 from me.",

Young Esteban (Eloy Azorin) want to become a writer and also to discover the identity of his father, carefully concealed by his beloved mother . Later on , there occurs a tragedy , then Manuela leaves Madrid for Barcelona , there hooks up old and new friends and ,just may be , contacts the long estranged father (Tony Canto) the boy never knew and her son's favourite stage diva (Marisa Paredes) . As Manuela gradually regains the will to live through her involvements with the lives with others such as a transvestite (Antonia San Juan) and a pregnant nun (Penelope Cruz) . Part of every woman is a mother/actress/saint/sinner and part of every man is a woman.Agreeable film full of feeling , outlandish characters , haunting mood-pieces , Spanish Neo-realism , and sense of style but not totally satisfactory , including conventional pitfalls , profanities and a lot of sexual references . The picture deals with off-the-wall as well as semi-ironic melodrama , familiar absurdities, dysfunctional roles and many other things ; featuring a feminist heroine of classical proportions . The picture is pretty well but turns out to be inferior to Almodovar's subsequent entries such as \u00a8The skin I live in\u00a8, \u00a8Volver\u00a8 , \u00a8The bad education\u00a8 or \u00a8Talk to her\u00a8. The result is undiluted scabrous drama , crazy strings of plots , sharp images , plenty of sexual dialogs in constant references to blow-jobs and perverted sex . Filmmaker piles up on the contrivances , turns and twisted events so that the picture to have success . It's a piquant look at lower-middle classes involving strange and complicated situations during its half an hour runtime . Pedro Almod\u00f3var dedicated his movie to Bette Davis, Gena Rowlands and Romy Schneider . And being influenced by American films such as \u00a8All about Eva\u00a8, \u00a8A streetcar named desire\u00a8 and by director Douglas Sirk . Nice interpretations by all cast , as Cecilia Roth as a hard-working single mummy , Penelope Cruz as a young nun bound for El Salvador, but instead finds out she is pregnant and Antonia San Juan as likable transvestite , she splendidly plays a monologue based on a real life event as when the electronic system of an theater failed, the director suspended the show , then an actress decided to give the news to the audience and make them an offer: if they'd stay, they could listen to the narration of her life . Furthermore , a notorious support cast such as Marisa Paredes , Rosa Maria Sarda , Fernando Fernan Gomez , Candela Pe\u00f1a ,Manuel Lozano , Juan Jose Otegui and other delightfully played roles . As usual in most of Pedro Almod\u00f3var's movies, there is a small role for Agust\u00edn Almod\u00f3var, his brother and producer of the film, who plays a cab man . Sensitive musical score by Alberto Iglesias , Almodovar's ordinary ; including some marvelous songs . Colorful and luxurious cinematography by Alfonso Beato . The motion picture was realized in his peculiar style by Pedro Almodovar ; he often uses symbolism and metaphorical techniques to portray circular story lines though here he directs a special melodrama , including his ordinary touches . Almodovar directs throughout with splendid zip and he usually portrays strong female characters and transsexuals and along his career getting some important international prizes . His first feature film, Pepi, Luci, Bom (1980), was made in 16 mm and blown-up to 35 mm for public release . In 1987, he and his brother Agust\u00edn Almod\u00f3var established their own production company : El Deseo, S. A.

It can't just be a matter of film stocks.  I wish I could speak Spanish.  I wouldn't have to look away; I could bask completely, not just intermittently, in the warmth - which is what the film is there for.Only one of the criticisms I've seen levelled at \"All About My Mother\" strikes me as more than merely flippant or ridiculous - Mike D'Angelo pointed it out in a short review, and much as I love the film, I must admit he has a point, one I ought to have noticed.  To quote: \"... the celebratory, groovy-woman-power ethos that permeates the film is somewhat inimical to drama ...  The women of Mother are so unfailingly resilient and benevolent and - there's really no other word but 'fabulous' - that the picture never achieves a real sense of urgency...\"Ya got me.  It doesn't.  Of course, now that I realise that there's less dramatic tension than their ought to be, I don't love the film any less.  I don't even miss the dramatic tension (which would, nonetheless, help if it were there).  Partly it's because of the colours.  Almod\u00f3var has made a film for us to wallow in; and if that's all we can do with it, at least the luscious colours - along with the music, and truly lovable, rather than merely eccentric and fascinating, characters - allow us to wallow properly.I will say that those who think Almod\u00f3var has wimped out and become politically correct are utterly wrong.  Political correctness has nothing to do with content; it has everything to do with treading gingerly and being stilted.  All About My Mother, stilted?  Rubbish - it's heartfelt, and Almod\u00f3var's direction is as sure-footed and fluent as ever.",

Overall, All About My Mother is one of the finest film that i've  watched, where it is hard for me to find any flaws in it. With Cecilia  Roth playing Manuela, the nurse who lost her only son,Estaban, to an  road accident, Manuela decided to fulfill her son's wish by looking for  her son's father, which turns out to be Lola, who has become a  transsexual. The whole movie is not only her journey of getting back a  piece of memory of Estaban, but at the same time, it also looks into  the world of transsexuals and lesbians. Not forgetting Penelope Cruz's  role of Sister Rosa, a pregnant nun who contracted HIV from Lola.   With conflicts between Huma, a theatre actress and Nina, her assistant  come lover, Agardo's monologue on being a transsexual and unstable  relationship between Sister Rosa and her mother, Almodovar presented us  the dark side of human being, apart from a mother who wants to fulfill  her dead son's wishes. Somehow, Almodovar hints us a message in most of  his films, that even homosexuals and transsexuals are human beings,  even though they are totally different from the rest.

Lola, a transvestite is not aware of Esteban which as the film progresses delivers numerous dramatic consequences and tear threatening montages.As writer and director Almodovar seems to be able to cement the right dramatic input at the right time, delivering a supposed expectancy only to strive to shock the audience with a powerful emotional twist or an unthinkable idea. To say what the unthinkable idea is in this 1999 release would be to spoil a well worked powerfully controlled heartbreaker, which would cost the true value of a picture purposefully identified with its drama.We have underage pregnancies, traumatic and unexpected death, family rivalry, former lovers, drug abuse and fiery working relationships that juxtaposed, all cement this in the drama genre and given the context they are used in add to a great sense of realism. The way everything threads together is nicely worked with only a few hitches.Roth's character a former actress is conveniently placed in a theatre to see what will follow to recapture the past, the absence of the father for such a long time distances some emotional connection for the audience and no matter how hard the plot works to convey its powerful message it never feels as compassionate and as emotionally connected as Volver.This film does boast some tremendous performances. A young Penelope Cruz would go on and generate her international stardom with this performance as the young worker who is pregnant. Cecilia Roth carries the picture with her constant driven attitude to not look back and thrives on living in the moment. The supporting cast all lend a strong array of drama and some good comedy from Antonio San Juan as Agrado, especially her scene on stage.The cinematography and usage of various places keeps the feisty drama alive. The dreadful scene with the prostitutes, the stage for the replica of A Streetcar named desire and the terrible incident in Madrid all combine to make this a wonderful drama.Strong well performed and written drama 8.5/10",

            "content": "Pedro Almodolovar is certainly an accomplished film-maker, in many respects: his movies look good and invariably contain interesting elements of plot. Yet for such an acclaimed director, I'm often surprised that when I see his movies, I see elements that I might consider amateurish, with stories that often feel like hastily assembled collections of scenes rather than an integrated whole. 'All About My Mother' displays this fault strikingly. Probably intentionally (because the film is in part a homage to the theatre), the story consists of separate acts, each one filling us in on what has happened since we last met the characters: and while drama occurring off-stage is a staple necessity of the live play, it seems weird in a film. Also, we are introduced to a long succession of characters, and it's hard to care about each, especially as certain key details are never explained (a nun is seduced by a transvestite, for example, but no-one seems to regard this is particularly odd). While I enjoyed the beginning of the movie (when I still had hope of a dramatic resolution), it seemed to lose focus as it went on, and it's final cut - to a rather strange, melodramatic dedicated presumably expressed by Amoldovar himself - leaves everything unresolved (although on reflection, the resolution has probably already happened, it's just that it does so undramatically so you don't even identify the pivotal scenes as you watch them). This film won plaudits, but it left me flat - and not knowing exactly what I was supposed to feel.",

            "content": "Spoilers herein.One of the most exciting promises of film is the ability to transport us to different worlds. Because a film carries information about the viewer, a skilled filmmaker can literally turn us into someone different for a while. So one would think that being transported to the rather alien world of Spanish film would be a welcome adventure. But this - at least - disappoints.Latins differ from Northern Europeans and nearly all North Americans in how they deal with abstraction. For Northerners, there is a notion of pure, higher values, apart from life. Stories illustrate great ideas, conflicts, questions, and no matter how realistic the situation shown, we know it is merely representative. This is a cultural convention found even in comedies and `date' movies. Check it out.Latins instead have a notion of a world centered in real people and real events where small acts aggregate. When common themes emerge, they grow out of life, so in art we have abstractions from life rather than life illustrating some invisible clockworks. Consequently, when Pedro tells a story, he becomes obsessed with a culturally rooted notion of honesty. The primary value we are supposed to appreciate here is his honesty, then the honesty of his actresses (the nonwomen men are just buffoons and poltroons), and finally, the honesty of the `real' characters.Then he takes all the self-referential tricks of his northern brethren and grafts them on. So here we have the film portraying a life, portrayed in a play, which references a film. The actors play characters playing actors. Some roles are transplanted from one to another - and just so we will not miss this, our heroine is a transplant facilitator who leaves her job to follow her son's heart.Actually, in another context, this could work well. And in fact there are several even recent films which successfully use much the same devices. But here, the notions of abstraction clash. Pedro wants to pander to Spanish notions of Olympian soap opera, and at the same time be considered a `serious' filmmaker by global viewers (well, forget the viewers to judge from his interviews, it is the critics who are targeted). Sorry, just doesn't mix - doesn't work in either venue.An unrelated complaint is Barcelona. What a wonderful place: this city was built for films. Some filmmakers would truly use this opportunity to exploit Gaudi's notions of motion in space: what else is film? But here, we have a lost opportunity, save some colored tiles. Worse, Pedro presents the place as if it were a Spanish city. It is no such thing. It is half African; it considers itself a separate nation; it speaks a different language; it hosts a cosmopolitan notion of modernity. It is to the world now what Paris was to the 30s but in three dimensions rather than two. It is ripe for exploitation for just this type of film, especially considering the sexual mores, the escape, the Alice-like entrance tunnel. How could he miss this?",

            "content": "One thing is for certain: you sure can't accuse Pedro Almodovar's `All About My Mother' of narrative timidity.  In its relatively brief 102-minute running time, it provides a literal smorgasbord of sensational plot elements: a fatal car accident, a dead teenaged son, organ transplantation, transvestite prostitutes, lesbianism, pregnant nuns, drug addiction, AIDS, Alzheimer's, and death by childbirth \u0096 more than enough juicy elements to warm the heart of any lover of classic melodrama or daytime soap operas. Even if the film had dealt with only half of these issues, it would still be a challenge to maintain some sort of overall focus.  As it is, we spend most of the movie staring in head-scratching amazement at the sheer audacity of the enterprise.Certainly, the critics have not been stingy in heaping effusive praise on the work and both the Motion Picture Academy and the Foreign Press Golden Globe committee have echoed that praise by bestowing on the film their coveted awards for Best Foreign Language Film of 1999.  But does the film really merit all these critical hosannas and kudos?  Not by a long shot! Jaded as we may be by the deadening predictability and lack of originality that, sadly, define the majority of films released each year, it is, nevertheless, still incumbent upon us not to be bowled over by a film that takes the alternate path of undisciplined bizarreness.  `All About My Mother' cries desperately to be a moving and important study of women's roles in society, but, by trying to compress so many of the eccentricities of life into one story, the film leaves us more incredulous and perplexed than stimulated and touched.One element does succeed brilliantly, however, and that is the outstanding performance of Cecilia Roth in the leading role of Manuela, an attractive 38-year old mother who, upon the sudden death of her child, is compelled to return to the dark past she long ago fled and to seek some sort of redemption.  She provides us with the warm center of human compassion this film so desperately needs to keep it from becoming a completely clinical exercise in absurdity.  Streamlined perhaps, her story might have made for a fascinating and incisive film.  But Almodovar is so busy loading up his film with rather obviously drawn parallels that we really never believe a minute of it.  The film is rife with ineffectual and pretentious allusions to `All About Eve' and `A Streetcar Named Desire,' as the movie characters' lives take vaguely similar paths to those of the characters found in those works.   And the finale, in which Manuela's maternal affections find a new object to latch on to, seems coy and artificial \u0096 an attempt to leave the audience on an emotional high after all the misery and heartbreak it has witnessed in the course of the film. The whole enterprise, ultimately, seems hopelessly artificial.That artificiality at least justifies the gorgeous look of the film. Almodovar has, as always, splashed across the screen his usual array of brightly colored walls, furniture and clothing that makes the film seem to exist in a world located somewhere between realism and surrealism.  This bold visual palette is always one of the joyous fringe benefits that accompanies the watching of an Almodovar film.Unfortunately, in this case at least, he hasn't created a film with a story, cast of characters or theme to match in quality or intensity the glorious, many-hued background he provides.  Despite all its many awards and its extraordinary critical acclaim, `All About My Mother' doesn't hold a candle to Almodovar's truly wonderful previous film, `Live Flesh.'  Check that one out instead and see the difference.",

            "content": "\"All About My Mother\" is a magnificent film by Pedro Almodovar about a woman, Manuela (Cecilia Roth) who, after her son's death, goes looking for his father and finds not only her past but her future. Almodovar brilliantly intertwines the story of \"All About Eve\" (shown on Spanish television in one of the scenes) with this story. (Due to a clause in her \"Eve\" contract, Celeste Holm was able to sue the producers of this movie and win an undisclosed settlement.)The acting is fantastic, and certainly when dealing with Almodovar, no one can say there aren't great roles for older women. Besides a fine performance from Penelope Cruz as a pregnant, HIV-infected nun and a beautiful one from Roth, Marisa Paredes is transcendent as an older actress playing Blanche in \"Streetcar\" who is in love with a junkie, Nina (Candela Pena). She combines glamor with desperation and humor. Antonia San Juan as Agrado, a transsexual, has the showy comic role, and she is fabulous. The monologue where she tells an audience waiting to see Streetcar the story of her life is a highlight of the movie. Toni Conto as Lola, the transsexual who is the father of Manuela's late son, gives a poignant performance.There is warmth, humor, tragedy, and sadness in \"All About My Mother,\" which presents fully fleshed out characters and tells us that whoever we are - nun, junkie, transsexual, nurse, actress or whore, we're all the same in our hurt, our love, and our desires, and that we can all help one another. A great story written by Almodovar and well executed by him.",

            "content": "Heavy spoilers.Think of Pedro Almodovar's \"All About My Mother\" as a John Irving adaptation, but minus the usual Hollywood cojones-removal surgery. Viewers who recall the transsexual Roberta in \"The World According to Garp\" might understand that I mean this statement literally as well as figuratively, but the figurative meaning is by far the more important. Like Irving - indeed like Dickens before him - Almodovar unapologetically mixes social commentary, humor, artifice, and sentimentality in equal measures. Yet Almodovar's artistic vision seems a lot less trivialized by its didactic and tear-jerking elements than does his American counterpart's.Although some might call it imbalanced, the film's integrity stems from its uncompromising feminine viewpoint and its exhaustive and exclusive portrayal of female roles and relationships. As Almodovar's epilogue tribute to actresses and his own mother make clear, males and masculinity take an intentional back seat in \"All About My Mother.\" Of the two fathers we meet in the film, one has such a strong feminine side that he has undergone breast implants and lives as a transsexual - even though his masculine, lower half still exerts enough force for him to have impregnated (over a span of 18 years) the film's two heroines, Manuela (played with extraordinary power and subtlety by Cecilia Roth) and the young Sister Rosa (played winningly by Penelope Cruz in her pre-Tom notoriety days). Rosa's father meanwhile has succumbed to Alzheimer's disease and no longer remembers his daughter (or, thus, his paternity) and has helplessly abandoned her and himself to the control of the film's least sympathetic - because most controlling and masculine - female, Rosa's mother. The other two significant males in the cast include a second transsexual, Agrado, who is Manuela's best friend and although still possessed of his nether member is exaggeratedly female in her/his responses (\"I live to please others.\") The remaining male, Manuela's 17 year old son Esteban, is the only one whose masculinity is physically uncompromised, but his feminine side is nevertheless evident in his journal writing, in his devotion to the stage - particularly the works of Tennessee Williams, and in his chummy confidant relationship with his mother. Nevertheless, Esteban does provide the film's strongest testimony of the need for gender balance, as he longs to connect to the father he has never known and who exists for him ironically as \"lack\" - the missing half of all his mother's old photographs.Unfortunately, Esteban's death marks the end of Act 1. He is run down by an automobile while chasing after an autograph from his idol, the famous stage star Huma, another key female figure in the film. Huma is an aging actress who specializes in victim/heroines - William's Blanche DuBois and Lorca's Bernarda Alba. She is also experiencing a troubled lesbian love affair with her co-star in \"Streetcar,\" a much younger, self-destructive drug addict named Nina. Following Esteban's death, Manuela's attempts to recover from the emotional trauma include working for and befriending Huma as well as a stand-in performance as Stella during one of Nina's drug flame-outs.Manuela's recovery is punctuated by her occasional dips into Esteban's writing journal where he had begun a work poignantly entitled \"Todo Sobre Mi Madre\" in honor of still another American work famously centered on female characters, \"All About Eve.\" The mother Esteban idealizes in his journal is the mother we see Manuela struggling to become in the film. That process accelerates when she agrees to shelter and nurture Rosa, who is pregnant, HIV-infected, and unable to face the censure of her mother or her religious order.Quite in keeping with Garp's claim that \"Life is an x-rated soap opera,\" \"All About My Mother\" resolves itself in a rush of soap opera-ish complications, coincidences, and confrontations. Rosa dies after naming her unborn son \"Esteban\"; Manuela becomes the child's surrogate mother and reconciles herself with his dying father, thus redeeming the masculine lack that the first Esteban painfully articulated in his journal; and the child himself makes a miraculous recovery from his HIV birth legacy. It's a mush feast, but it works. Dickens would have loved it.",

            "review_title": "Almodovar's BEST film about women!",
            "content": "One thing that seems to be consistent in Almodovar films is his fixation on women who have gone/are going through earth shattering experiences.  Even in his most male dominated films (Law of Desire) there was still plenty of screen time devoted to a woman on the edge.  All About My Mother is certainly no exception, but without question, this one is the most compelling.Cecilia Roth plays Manuela.  She's a single mom with a teenage boy, making ends meet.  One night her son is hit by a car.  His death destroys her.Manuela returns to her past in Barcelona, hooking up with old friends and making some new ones.  She reconnects with a transsexual, hooks up with an actress (currently starring as Blanche Dubois in A Streetcar Named Desire) and takes care of a pregnant nun who also happens to be dying of AIDS.  This assortment of people are not there to help her put her sons death behind her, but rather to help her come to terms with her past.Almodovar puts together an odd assortment of tragic figures that are at once arresting, and always symbolic.  Antonia San Juan as La Agrado, the transexual prostitute is typically loud and sassy.  Despite her own obvious issues she is the strong one of the group.  She becomes the matriarch, stepping in when the chips are down for everyone else.Huma (played by Marisa Paredes) is an aging actress who's own daughter is a drug addict.  Playing opposite her daughter in A Streetcar Named Desire, she seems like she has it all together, but she needs Manuela, and later Agrado, to take care of her.  Finally, Penelope Cruz plays Hermana Rosa, a mousy nun.  Pregnant and dying of AIDS, she seems like the last thing Manuela needs, but her pain is what becomes necessary for Manuela to become stronger.  All About My Mother is a tearjerker about unlikely people finding solace in each other.  True to Almodavar's past work, the storyline is not predictable. Situations and scenes just seem to happen and they don't always have to have a specific or meaningful reason behind them. \nAll About My Mother is the years best and most talked about foreign film, without a doubt, and by my estimation, far better than that Life Is Beautiful trash that was thrust upon us last year.",

As usual with a Pedro Almodovar movie, there is a joyful openness about cross gender men, and an emphasis on women, who are really everything in the movie (including the man who is a woman). I've always seen an improbable parallel with Woody Allen films, not in the flavor of the narrative and characters, which are Almodovar's province, but in the way they are filmed, the intimate feel, the willingness to take chances, and most of all, the fineness of control. As much as the plot seems to tip out of control, the movie is very much a taut, refined, beautiful piece, an artwork. Many of us here in the United States will be entranced by this early Penelope Cruz appearance (though she had done a couple dozen films earlier, with limited U.S. exposure), and she is riveting and emotionally expressive.

It's shouting out Almodovar! \nHe's meticulously serious in leaving out no details. Nothing is superficial but presented with thought.

The tempo is ever effervescent.Cast is perfect. Lead by Cecilia Roth's central character Manuela, along with Marisa Paredes' stage queen Huma, Penelope Cruz's fragile yet strong young nun Rosa, Antonia San Juan's can't help being delightful Agrado, Rosa Maria Sarda's classic caring yet apprehensive mother of Rosa, and Candela Pena as Huma's bad influence Nina. Thrown into the mix are references to Bette Davis speaking in Spanish in \"All About Eve,\" Tennessee Williams' \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" in Spanish on stage, and various perspectives into women professions and camaraderie.His is always life affirming with hope, playfulness, laughter and heart - women definitely like his films. He dedicated this one to all actresses who are mothers, and all the mothers in the world, and of course, his mother. He has boldness, brass, and gusto. French veteran writer-director Eric Rohmer's women stories, which also revolve around Fate and Chance, are subtle, calm and poetic, while Almodovar's can very well be bursting into songs and jovial chorale. Seriously he makes fun of life events with such pleasure, unworried of embarrassment, yet sensitivity is integral and never lacking. He is a master soap opera weaver and he delivers it with such aplomb that you cannot but cheer along with him and care, cry, and laugh with his characters. 1988 \"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown\", 1997 \"Live Flesh\", and now \"All About My Mother\" clearly demonstrate only Almodovar can come up and deliver such evolving entanglements and unwind it all.

As the credits begin, they read that the movie is dedicated to a long list of different sorts of actresses and women similar to the characters in the film, but I think that at its core, it sympathizes with a handful of general people that go unrecognized a lot of the time.One of these groups of people is frankly mothers. The main character of Manuela is a mother who revisits her life before the birth of her son, who has just died at age 17. Most people would revisit this life after the death of a loved one because nostalgia would perhaps soothe their aching emotions, but she instead sacrifices that possibility by searching for her son's father and projecting aspects of motherhood upon the lives of many whom she meets. I love her character because of the natural way she strikes the viewer, thanks to Almodovar's writing and Cecilia Roth's performance, as an emotional but optimistic, freedom-loving, honest and philosophical woman, despite her past and her friends. I believe Almodovar also means to recognize anyone who keeps large portions of themselves hidden, which Manuela does.Really, the film is just entertaining and fulfilling because despite its penchant for tranvestitism and unusual plot strands, it truly is a slice of life, not only because of its realistic sideline happenstances of sexual diseases, but mostly because its characters do what characters are meant to do for us when we go to the movies, which is that they provide us with good company. We enjoy these people, and we care about them greatly. They're realistic and well-played.Almodovar's cinematography is a great highlight, as every background is rich and the colors are bold and thick.

            "content": "I came to this film wanting to hate it, but I was seduced by it and it affected me deeply.  Why hate?  Because I had just seen a TV documentary about Almodovar.  He talks a good deal of shallow rubbish, and the showbusiness darlings who surround him are vile. However, his film speaks with the sincere voice of artistic talent.  It even has a touch of greatness.It is a film about Woman.  Almodovar is well-known for his preoccupation with feminine sensibility, and here we go through the range of female awarenesses - Madre, Puta, Actriz.  This is not the 'macro' masculine world of war and politics, but the feminine 'micro' universe of caring, loving and suffering.  In a real sense, it is \"All About Eve\".Manuela loves her son Esteban totally and unconditionally.  When he is taken from her, she must forge a new life.  Back in her native Barcelona she finds fulfilment caring for Rosa the pregnant nun and Huma the barren actress.  A new Esteban appears, and the cycle of living and loving begins again.This flimsy summary of the story gives no real idea of the film's symbolic and dramatic richness.  It is a pattern made of other patterns, with stories repeating, reversing and overlapping endlessly.  Names can mean a break with the past (Agrado, Huma) or they can insist on continuity (Rosa, Esteban).  In the guignol tradition, names can also delineate character - Agrado tries to make life agreeable for others, Huma Rojo is red smoke, a hollow illusion, and Nina is an adult with a child's personality.Almodovar deliberately offends against social custom.  Women are fathers, birth means death and drama is more real than life.  It is tempting to think of Almodovar as the new Bunuel, and he takes the same childish pleasure in shocking the 'decent' Spanish bourgeoisie.  When Agrado gives her performance in the theatre, the old folks walk out in disgust while the youngsters stay and are entertained.\"This play marked my life,\" says Manuela of 'A Streetcar Named Desire'. It made her a mother (the defining experience of her existence) because it introduced her to Lola.  She explains that she played Stella and Lola played Kowolski, literally and figuratively.  The male symbol is brutal and cruel, the female symbol is the nurturer of life who endures abuse because she loves.  Like Stella, Manuela escaped, pregnant and alone.  The play returns later as Esteban's birthday treat and the cause of his death.  Manuela knows the text by heart, and when she follows the production to Barcelona, fate pulls her into the drama and she triumphs as Stella.  Huma is Blanche, the sad derelict, \"relying on the kindness of strangers\".  (Another link with the play is the title of Almodovar's own production company, \"Deseo\".)Esteban's delight with his new book is shown in the reading of the foreword - \"es un prefacio maravilloso!\"  The film, similarly, has a marvellous preface.  A bag of plasma drips purposefully, its valve shaped like a crucifix.  The symbolism is rich and catholic, and prepares us for what will come - here is a figurative mother, giving the blood of life and suffering the cross of sorrow.  Taps, console and graph represent institutionalised care, as opposed to the natural, personal care of a mother.  These things are neat and orderly, but cold and soulless.  This is the organ donation unit of a hospital.  It does excellent work, but we see its effort in fragments rather than a whole.  The files list organs, not people - 'higado', 'corazon'.  Technology can help us, but it can never replace maternal love.  We feel uneasy when we are told that \"the machine is breathing for him\".Manuela works as a nurse (symbol of the nurturing mother) in this unit, and we see her as an actress appearing in a training video, playing a mother whose son is dead.  Two doctors ask for the boy's organs.  New life must be nourished from his body's wreckage.  When the scene is repeated for real, it is almost too painful to watch.  Almodovar takes us to the 'meta' level, with Manuela's anguish setting up cross-rhythms with her professionalism. Love is stronger than systems, and the organ co-ordinator weeps for Manuela.The real Manuela stands tiny before a vast advert for 'Streetcar', showing Huma's face.  Is the image more potent than the individual?  Or is Almodovar saying that superficial impact fades, whereas human empathy endures?  What is the relationship between the true woman and her made-up face?  Esteban dies pursuing the 'red smoke' of an actress's fame.  If he had stayed with his real mother and not chased an illusion, he would have been safe.Esteban will bestow new life.  We go with Manuela as she follows her son's heart to Coruna, where another young man has hope restored.  The mulch of death feeds the roots of life.  Manuela knows two places, Spain's first and second cities, Madrid and Barcelona (importantly for Almodovar, these are the two pre-eminently 'modern' towns).  She moves between them along the tunnel umbilicus, as a pregnant teenager, childless mother and finally as triumphant madonna with the 'new' Esteban.The spectacular vista of Barcelona and sumptuous portal of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia rapidly disappear, and we are soon in an ugly wasteland where prostitutes parade as grotesques in a hell worthy of Goya.  These two Barcelonas recur again and again - the outward city of quirky, appealing architecture and the mean streets of the hopeless, directionless underclass.\nAlmodovar's narrative has been engrossing up to this point.  Now it will expand and deepen as a new cast of characters is woven into the film's fabric.\"Que raro!\"",

And even though this movie is all about women and she-males, doing teatre and the life of Manuela., it captured me.Manuela is a mid-age woman who lives with her teen-son, his father left his mother long before he was born, and he has got high hopes and dreams for the future, wanting to be a writor, when suddenly her entire life gets turned up side down, when her beloved son gets hit by a car, and dies. Now she is in the same position as before, only this time she is facing the hard times alone. But luckily things doesn't turn out that black. Her life goes on, and I think this movie truly proves that life goes on, no matter what.\nThis was an obvious winner for best foreign language film at the Oscars this year, and I'm sorry I never saw it at the cinemas. I wish more films could be like this.9/10",

When Esteban is tragically killed, Manuela sets out to Barcelona to find Esteban's father, a man Esteban never met and who doesn't know Esteban existed.Written and directed by Pedro Almodovar, there are many emotional aspects to this movie that are straight from the Almodovar playbook: grief and how people deal with it, a life being redirectioned after a major event, something positive coming from tragedy, new friends. There's also elements of that other Almodovar trademark: farce.Unfortunately there's also the one thing that seems to dog many Almodovar films: an unfocussed, almost random, middle section. After a very intriguing setup things happen in a haphazard, seemingly pointless way. Many of these events and directions have a bearing on the conclusion but at the time, and for much of the middle section, everything just seems tangential. This limits engagement, thus limiting the impact of the ending.Ultimately, the movie is okay, but nothing more than that.",

This tender film is the latest stage in this ascending path, and very welcome it is, too.Cecilia Roth's performance is utterly convincing - profound, varied, humane. The other characters are strongly drawn, too. The photography is excellent, and even the tricksy shots aren't too distracting. The narrative is not without surprises (the tragic event early in the film is called to mind constantly without ever becoming maudlin). It's a little slow in places, and there are moments of unintentional humour, but overall this represents the best work of this director that I have seen.",

            "content": "Todo sobre mi madre / All about my mother starts very well with an introduction of Manuela Coleman (refers to La flor de mi secreto, another Almod\u00f3var-movie) and her son Esteban. Esteban documents his mother's life as a writer, hence the title of the movie. When pursuing an autograph of stage actress Huma Esteban dies (the car accident well executed by the way). His heart is transplanted to another person, his mother as a hospital worker is able to track that person down. After following her son's heart to La Coru\u00f1a she follows her own heart back to Barcelona, where her personal history really lies with a background as prostitute. She meets Agrado, a former co-worker, and Sister Rosa. She frequently visits the play \"A Streetcar named Desire\" and finally meets Huma and drug-addicted Nina back-stage. After the principal story is set out, many interactions and twists will of course follow.Pedro Almod\u00f3var makes clever use of several devices to lift this out of the ordinary: Actors in the play being replaced by other actors in the movie. He uses red (and black) to signify that lives and burdens are passed on from one character to the other. The story frequently shifts focus to keep us interested. The performance of A Streetcar Named Desire and references to All About Eve (among others) all meant as play-in-the-play and to comment the story as a meta-story. The play reflects real life, but is also an abstraction of it. The story takes place mainly in Barcelona, synonymous for modernity.From the strong beginning onwards Almod\u00f3var is however unable to maintain the high level he started with. It is just not well-structured enough when seen as a whole and therefore the quality is uneven. It all ends a bit like superior melodrama on soap level, and he can do much better than that.But Almod\u00f3var has great visual talent: The way the opening credits roll for example, but also Manuela leaving and returning Barcelona by train in a short shot of two trains. From this he went on to explore all positives mentioned here to make the far superior Hable con ella / Talk to Her and La mala educaci\u00f3n / Bad Education, both better structured and more visually imaginative.",

Returning home is never quite as simple as one may think, as our protagonist discovers when she sets out to locate her ex-partner. When she arrives in her home town, a whole host of old friends and memories come out of the woodwork to bask her in an odd kind of nostalgia, one that feels keenly present even if it can't quite be identified. The picture as a whole has this enigmatic vibe running throughout it, even though its initial mystery isn't actually what it's about and barely has any play in its midsection. Instead, the story plays out as a sort of 'slice of life' for its central characters. It doesn't have an especially tight plot, yet it's distinctly compelling. It's about character above all else. It's a film about women, which you may expect with an Almod\u00f3var affair, and it also deals with a variety of typically taboo subjects in an open-minded, empathetic way. In this sense, it sort of champions the overlooked and downtrodden, refusing to pass judgement on any of its characters. Plus, although no trans actors appear, the piece does an excellent job with trans representation. In the end, it's a colourful, affecting and seemingly unrestricted experience. 7/10",

It's all so implausible that it hurts. Okay, I get that it's a \"movie\" and that the notion of \"realism\" is not of the utmost importance, but this film is a muddled mess that confuses \"shocking\" and \"ridiculous\" with \"edgy\" and \"interesting.\"TALK TO HER (HABLE CON ELLA) is a far far better film.

Just like in Volver, when I was watching All About My Mother I had no idea where it was going to go next. Considering how much time I spend watching movies it has reached a point where I am seldom completely surprised by a film, yet here I was riveted because I simply could not guess what would happen next. There were so many predictable or expected paths for this script to take, but it never opted for the obvious. The other thing that was great about All About My Mother was the fact that it is constantly exploring different genres. There's an emotional drama in here, there's a comedy, there's a look at transgender issues, and more. It's one of those rare movies that made me both laugh out loud and cry within the same hour, and that kind of emotional roller coaster is a delight.The cast is marvelous, and I loved how they each played a unique and interesting character. Cecilia Roth is at the heart of it all and you can feel her conflicted emotions through the entire movie. Her reactions often mirrored my own since you could tell she didn't know how to deal with all that was happening with her son, her old life, and the new people in her life. Admittedly, there are some things that happen in this movie that I didn't enjoy all that much. I was put off by a few of the choices that were made, and struggled a lot with the character of Agrado, as she came off as annoying (which wasn't an accident but I still didn't like it.) I actually prefer Volver because that plot happened to go in a direction that was more impactful for me. With that being said, All About My Mother was still an excellent film, and one I'm glad I had the opportunity to experience. I'm not sure it would be quite as thrilling the second time when I know where the plot is going, but for the first time it was a treat.",

This is the counterweight to \"Women on the Verge...\"It is sad, but not depressing.  This film was so well acted, it is a shame it did not receive more attention in the USA (as in AWARDS).  Perhaps the lead character, Manuela is just too Christlike in her acceptance of the flaws in people, and too ready to help those around her for it to make headway in the US.  True, there is some subject matter that may be a little too difficult for some viewers (transvestite prostitute, drug usage) but for someone looking for a story that is not canned and predictable, and not like anything offered from Hollywood, then this film is for you.

            "content": "All About My Mother is an breathtaking Spanish tragedy from the same director as Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown. It follows the intertwining lives of four women (well, three women and a drag queen) living in Barcelona as they go through tragedy after tragedy.Manuela's son Esteban is killed on his birthday while chasing after a cab containing his favourite stage actress, trying to get her autograph. He is run over by a car, and Manuela decides it is time for her to return to Barcelona and confront Esteban's father, who has no idea he has a son, after almost eighteen years. The first person she meets when she arrives is her old friend Agrado, a drag queen prostitute, who introduces Manuela to Sister Rosa at the local Nunnery in the hope of them finding work. They talk of someone named Lola who has mysteriously disappeared after looting the flat of Agrado, who she was staying with. Manuela actually gets a job as the assistant to Huma Roja, the actress his son was chasing after when he was killed. She soon quits to look after Sister Rosa, who is pregnant and HIV positive, both by Lola, and Agrado takes over as Huma's assistant.Months later, Sister Rosa gives birth to the child she only told her mother about weeks earlier, names it Esteban, and promptly dies from her disease, leaving Manuela and Rosa's mother to look after the baby. At the funeral, Lola - the father of Rosa and Manuela's children - arrives. He is dying of AIDS, and wants to see his child just once before he dies. Manuela obliges him, and tells him about the other son he never knew he had. She soon leaves Barcelona with the baby, to take him somewhere less hostile. She returns two years later to attend a HIV conference - the baby has negativised the virus in record time. She meets up with Huma and Agrado again, and the three women are reunited.If the above description sounds complicated, it's not. It easily fits in to the hour-and-a-half running time without ever feeling rushed. If the ending sounds like sentimental twaddle, well maybe it is, but it's handled so expertly that you won't be worrying about that when you watch it. If the fact that it's full of HIV and drag queens bothers you, don't let it. It's also full of incredible acting, particularly Cecilia Roth as Manuela. The film manages to make you feel sympathetic to some people who, frankly, have ruined their own lives.The first twenty minutes, concerning Esteban's death, in particular are excellent, playing like the most disturbing comedy of repetition and irony ever. Manuela, a nurse, rings up another hospital to arrange a liver transplant after her patient dies; within a day, another nurse rings the hospital to arrange a heart transplant after Esteban dies. Manuela acts as a bereaved woman for demonstration purposes during a seminar; within a day, the same scene is played out for real. Esteban almost gets run over as he crosses the road to meet Manuela before they go to see A Streetcar Named Desire; within a matter of hours he is dead after being run over. At the end of the film, Huma is starring in a play about a woman whose son is run over.A Streetcar Named Desire plays a central role in this movie. Manuel and Esteban go and see it on the night he is killed, and when Manuela moves to Madrid, so does the production of the play. She goes to see it on the first night to exorcise the ghosts of her sons death, and when she goes backstage to meet Huma Roja, who plays Blanche, they become friends. When Huma finds out what happened she is as plagued by memories and guilt as Manuela is. Also, Manuela first met Lola through an amateur production of Streetcar, and when the actress playing Stella has to pull out for a night, Manuela takes over. Later on, when the two lead actresses hospitalise each other through misplaced affection, Agrado announces the cancellation but offers to tell her life story for anyone who stays. She finishes on the line: `...you are more authentic the more you resemble what you've dreamed you are.'All of this is seems very apt, as All About My Mother seems to me like a modern day update of Streetcar. Both have high levels of artistic quality, both are about the effects that the death of a young boy has on a woman, both feature women receiving bad treatment from men, both include the idea of running away, both are undeniably sad. Sure, this time round, some of the men are dressed as women, but the effect is the same.Before you think this is an entirely feminine movie, one tragic man infiltrates the drag queens, aging diva actresses and tragic mothers. On her way to labour, Sister Rosa stops the cab in the city square and we see her father. But he's been senile for a long time now, his only pleasure is walking his dog, and in one of the most touching scenes of the movie, he doesn't even recognise his own daughter enough to ask her anymore than her age and height, the same questions he poses to everyone he meets for the first time.I've used the word tragedy a lot in this review. Because it's the only way to really describe the movie. Not just one of the best foreign films, but one of the best films. To sum it up, here's the ending caption:`To Bette Davis, Gena Rowlands, Romy Schneider... To all actresses who have played actresses, to all women who act, to men who act and become women, to all the people who want to be mothers. To my mother.'",

It's a melodrama, certainly, but utterly true to itself and its cast of extravagant characters.

The best part was the leading performance by Cecilia Roth, whom I had never seen in a film before, but now I'm also curious about her work as well. She plays a nurse who's son seems to be an aspiring scribe for either the stage or screen. On an outing to the theater one night, her son is struck down by a car chasing an autograph of a stage star. It is a shocking scene, and is basically the backbone to the film. This is a film about motherhood, and what it means to be a mother, both in a masculine and feminine manner. This film is somewhat of ensemble film, but I would label it more of a tragic-comedy with solid characters. An ensemble film to me has a lot of interweaving characters, but this film's characters seemed to be pretty tight.

Through a growing web of female characters, All About My Mother celebrates female solidarity as we see each one shows right in time to rescue the other from the brink of collapse by creating emotional bonds between one another to fill in each other's gaps and get each others to complement their missing halves. Stupendous performances from all around, but I was struck, in particular, by Cecilia Roth's bravura performance as the lead character Manuela. The emotional range she shows is impressive and the entire movie she seems as if her eyes locked in tears, ready to fall anytime her son is brought up in any conversation. These scenes show how inextricably linked her complex feelings of haunting grief are, as she mourns Esteban's death and her being bereft of maternity at the same time. All About My Mother is also a panorama of vivid colours and moments of 'joie de vivre' that keep the film light on its feet while bolstering its tribute to actresses as well as its female spirit.

A woman... that beautiful genre ... that delicate genre that many of us, the man do for the women. But the women deserves that and much more ...because a woman is maybe the most beautiful prove of the existence of the divine. I mean, we the men have, of course good things too.\"Todo sobre mi madre\" is the story of four women that suffers. That cry. That laugh. That lives. Manuela and his son Esteban goes to the new version in Spain of \"Un Tranvia Llamada Deseo\" for the birthday of the son. But the horrible weather and an unfortunate accident cause that the life of Manuela change in several ways. If you see some films before \"Todo sobre mi madre\" you maybe remember how the Transvestite people is so framed, like Miguel Bose in \"Tacones Lejanos\" or \"La Ley del Deseo\" (Which i know the topic and some of the plot, but i have not seen yet) you thought that is clich\u00e9 of Almod\u00f3var that maybe become boring. But here in \"Todo sobre mi madre\" (now i notes the relationship with the title \"All About Eve\") the transvestism is more than a sexual election, is meaning. How important could be to a person be the person that wants be, like Agrado says in her monologue of her life. \"Todo sobre mi madre\" is an important analysis of the women, the men and the sons and daughters. Esteban, an important character, want write (he want to be a writer) about his mother life. And Esteban write it, in all the movie tell us about her and the other women with his mother has a relation and friendship. More that a drama (yes is a drama of course) is a movie of feelings. Fellings and courage. Besides, i have never seen to Penelope Cruz so beautiful like in this film. At half of the movie, my mother comes from the hospital today, she now is fine. I stop the movie for a while, i down to the door and i gave her a kiss. A mother ... that important character of our lives that much people ignore. Although i have not seen all the movies of Almod\u00f3var, this title is enough to tell you that Almod\u00f3var make movies ... real movies. And \"Todo sobre mi madre\" is a real movie ... one hour ago i finish the movie ... and you don't know how happy i am because there is a movie like this in this world of happiness and sorrow. ---And now an SPOILER from Esteban---Manuela and her son, Esteban, begin to see \"All About Eve\", the translation tell to the public in Spanish \"Eva al desnudo\" (Eva nude) Esteban- What way to change the title! \"All About Eve\" means \"Todo sobre Eva\" Manuela- \"Todo sobre Eva\" suena raro...Esteban begins to write...\"Y ahora todo lo que sigue ... es sobre mi madre (And now, all that follows ... is about my mother)\"ESTEBAN *Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any",

This film doesn't take itself too seriously - it has the appeal of a soap opera, outstanding performances, specially Cecilia Roths. Pedro Almodovars films convey a deep portrayal of the feminine universe. In some ways one can compare him with Antonioni (Le Amiche) and Bergman (Persona). What distinguishes Almodovar from them is his anarchic sense of humor. I don't like Almodovar so much when he tries to do artsy-seriously minded films. Whenever Almodovar lets his sense of humor and improvisation prevail we are in for a treat. \"Todo sobre mi Madre\" shows a balance that is not present in, let's say, \"Entre Tenieblas\" (that has also the delicious mixture of music, drama and comedy, but lacks the depth of \"todo sobre mi madre\" Highly recommended.

            "content": "All About My Mother is one of the most enigmatic films I have seen in years; and this is precisely what makes it one of the best contemporary films and this is also why I dare say that time will give this film a place in history. The story is a sad and somber one: five female characters, each one involved in her own drama, Manuela has lost her only child and takes a journey back into her past to look for the child's father, Agrado is a struggling prostitute in need of a friend, Nina a neurotic actress addicted to heroine, Huma Rojo is a desperate woman in search of love, and Sister Rosa is a young nun with two big problems, she is pregnant and is HIV positive. Such a display of human dramas seems demoralizing, but the truth is Almodovar gives the audience the story in a fresh way; never evading the drama, the film itself is not somber, but radiant with hope, faith and friendship. Almodovar has always been very good in depicting the female world; but this is his most outstanding creation, a beautiful mixture of a superb screenplay which I think every persona that sees it can relate to, a story which fills us with tears and smiles at the same time. Cinema is truly a way of communication, and what Almodovar achieves with this film is an undeniable connection with the spectator, almost every watcher was deeply touched by it. A coincidence? I don't think so, it's the work of a master contemporary (and sometimes underrated) director. We can't say that only Almodovar shone with this movie, for every element in it is outstanding, every performance is riveting. The performance of Cecilia Roth (Manuela) should have been an Academy Award nomination at least. The entire supporting cast was incredible, specially Antonia San Juan (Agrado, the prostitute). The cinematography is beautiful and the tango influenced score was a hit. I will also venture to say that this is the best film I have seen in my life, one the same lines as Casablanca, Psycho and A Clockwork Orange. Thank you Pedro Almodovar for this film! My verdict: Evidently a 10 out of 10.",

            "content": "I prefer the Pedro Almodovar of \"Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown\" over the Almodovar of \"The Flower of My Secret\" or his Oscar-winning \"All About My Mother.\"  I miss the madcap, wiggy, inventive way he hits his marks.  He did it with verve and panache; and he did it blessedly fast. You weren't forced to take too much of what was going on seriously, and yet no one would have been able to pry me from my seat.  He made it look like les mujeres were calculating their next move on the spot, and this gave \"Women on the Verge...\" a kind of highwire-act suspense.  The tension he created left me watching breathlessly.Almodovar has discarded this wonderful side of himself for something more profound, and, unfortunately, more conventional.  That doesn't mean there is precious nothing to take home with you: the depth of Marisa Paredes' grief (Here she plays a revered actress named Huma Rojo.) in \"The Flower...;\" and the haunting face of Eloy Azorin in this one.  Even if you're not always sure where the story will lead you, you feel as though you're traipsing through emotional ground Ingmar Bergman had dredged up far too many times to suit even his most ardent fans.When you're forced as you are in \"All About My Mother\" to look headlong at Manuela (Cecilia Roth), a nurse who has raised her only son (Azorin) who had been fathered by a man (Toni Canto) who abandons them after deciding getting breasts could only add to his appeal, it's hard to muster sympathy for the rest of the sexually-disfranchised in this movie--and this includes the pregnant nun Rosa (Penelope Cruz).  Pity or empathy isn't exactly Almodovar's point, I'm sure; \"All About My Mother\" takes for granted the prerogatives of the transgender world to do as they please with their bodies and their lives and see as benighted people like Rosa's mother (Rosa Maria Sarda) who cannot touch her own grandchild because he's HIV-positive.  (I don't think I'd be that fidgety over the situation if confronted with it, but I'm not sure I blame the woman either.)When Manuela's mammary-man-friend Agrado (Antonia San Juan) tries salvaging what is left of a presentation of \"A Streetcar Named Desire,\" the movie feels like it's grinding to a halt, and the moment strikes me as condescending.  (I think the critic Molly Haskell's notion that characters like Blanche Du Bois or Margo Channing are really figments of a transgender wish-fulfillment is equally as patronizing.  You could prop Haskell's impressions on a book shelf right next to Mother Rosa's fears.)The hearts and flowers that we get in the end don't root very deep; neither does the moralizing.  The moral here could be \"When you die, make sure the mortician gets the make-up right for your funeral.\"  Otherwise, it would be the same politically correct platitudes we get on the E Channel.  The only thing that runs counter to the shallow sentiments is the tenderness which Cecilia Roth brings to the fray.  She should have been nominated for an Oscar.Azorin's is not the only unforgettable face.  Fernando Fernan Gomez (\"Belle Epoque\") who plays Sister Rosa's father holds the camera in the few moments he's on screen.  Spain would look to have resurrected their own Ralph Richardson.  I needed to clear my eyes to make sure it wasn't him.  The great ones never really die.",

I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is inclined to see how the other side lives.

However, Manuela will not stop to mourn for her son but all these women will lead her to a new life. This is a movie about women and it is clearly dominated by women. Strange enough it does not show such a thing as strong hate against men. As a message you might state that men are not really important for the life of a woman.

            "content": "Young Esteban (Eloy Azurin) wants to become a writer and also to discover the identity of his father, carefully concealed by his mother Manuela (Cecilia Roth). This is very visually striking film, with the bold use of primary colors (blues and reds) for scenery and often in the foreground. The cinematography in general is pretty decent, but it is evident that the director's real goal is to evoke emotion through color and patterns (the wallpaper in this film is outrageous).As a story, it is compelling and intriguing. To say there is one steady narrative is not strictly true. While it follows Manuela over a two month period, we are constantly being introduced to unlikely characters and see how they interact and their lives intertwine. Some twists are predictable, but many are not.The film has a way of making the taboo not so taboo. Prostitutes, transvestism, HIV, drug use and other topics come up and are discussed without seeming out of the ordinary or \"wrong\". But more interestingly, aside from a brief prostitution scene, the film is also very subtle -- there is little nudity and no drugs are ever on-screen.The parallels with \"Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"All About Eve\" are masterfully interwoven with the film. These two stories are both in the movie and alongside it. The character of Huma Rojo admires Bette Davis, and the film begins with a critique of \"All About Eve\" before Manuela begins living it. \"Streetcar\" is also a recurring theme... appearing as an actual play, but also more than this.Roger Ebert says the film is \"sincere and heartfelt; though two of its characters are transvestite hookers, one is a pregnant nun and two more are battling lesbians, this is a film that paradoxically expresses family values.\" And he is right, echoing what I said above about none of this seeming \"wrong\"... it is just another family trying to live, albeit a family structure not normally recognized as \"family\".He further says, \"Manuela is the heroine of the film and its center, but Agrado is the source of life.\" This is a difficult assessment to agree with or not. Manuela clearly is the heroine, but is Agrado the \"source of life\"? Or is s/he a tragic, yet comic figure? It is difficult to envy or admire her, though she has chosen this way of life on purpose: every inch of her body was an intentional act. She has followed her dreams, as misguided and foolhardy as we may think they are.I am not familiar with the director's other work, but giving this film an Oscar seems more than fair. It tells a story that is not strictly one of Spain but is far more universal. And while most of us do not have prostitution and heroin in our daily lives, we do understand the role of motherhood.",

And I also must add that for some reason he also likes medical equipments very much and he film it very passionately.Golden Globe winner \"All About my Mother\" is the story of \"Manuela\". How she experience the same pattern of her life again when her young son \"Esteban\" dies in a car accident on his 17th birthday as he runs to seek an actress's autograph. After this incident her life revolves one more time in the same pattern. She experience the same emotions, and encounter the people in the similar way It happened with her 17 years Ago.Actually in my experience Life always follows a pattern, Most of us just don't notice it.

It's like going through the same lesson twice, like revising it to make sure that I learn it very well.The way Almod\u00f3var's portray the characters in his films, It demands very high level of emotional and psychological sense of human life to understand its genuineness.

What all Almodovar films share, even such relatively dark ones as \"What Have I Done to Deserve This\" and \"Dark Habits,\" is the compassion their creator shows for his characters. People are shown taking often hilarious, often extreme, measures to restore meaning to their lives.  \"All About My Mother\" recovers reasons for living through the victory of sanity, tolerance, solidarity, and compassion itself.There is so much to recommend this movie.  The characters are compelling, the performances all strong.  My favourites are Agrado who provides with unforgettable comedy the reality check even when she is the one creating her own reality, and Huma, tormented yet so full of grace in every sense of the word, played by my most beloved of Almodovar's actresses, Marisa Paredes, but it would be unjust not to mention the mother Manuela (Cecilia Roth) and son Esteban (Eloy Azarin) whose interrupted dialogue binds the movie together, both interpreters of  exceptional deftness and power.As usual, the lush score and visual design help stylize and elevate the film into the fabular-poetic realm without leaving the earth, everyday life, and the contemporary world's problems.With \"All About My Mother,\" Almodovar has fulfilled the promise of \"Flower of My Secret\" -- to embark on a new more reflective art, structured not around fantastical melodramatics but around the more \"ordinary\" tribulations of the heart (there the estrangement of a husband and a wife, here the opening up of other kinds of distance between loved ones and lovers), but all still lightened and seasoned with his miraculous sense of comedy.",

            "content": "**spoilers**Almodovar's film is to be lauded for its technical brilliance, consistently moving performances, and a generous dose of the old in-your-face perversion for which Pedro has been celebrated and reviled.But \"All About My Mother\" has an insidious inverse morality--it could have a subtitle: \"The Opposite of Misogyny.\"  I cannot recall a film with such a negative view of the male of the species, the obvious exceptions to this view being the two characters who want to BE women.Of these, Agrado (the Agreeable One) is as funny, tragic, and compassionate as all the other well-drawn female characters.  Lola, when s/he finally appears, is shown in both aspects, as a mother weeping over the death of the son s/he never knew, and as a man responsible not only for victimizing Manuela and Agrado, but also, horrifically, for impregnating and willfully infecting the angelic Sister Rosa.  We chuckle almost amiably, along with Almodovar, at their pride over their precious store-bought breasts, while at the same time unconsciously registering the havoc and destruction, the evil that their (our) maleness can and has wrought.The rest of the masculine gender is represented by 1) Rosa's father, a beyond-doddering fool whose conversational skill consists of asking a woman's age and height, 2) the actor playing Stanley Kowalski, who effectively reinforces Tennessee Williams' archetypal brute offstage, and 3) the lost son, who is morally neutral, but must serve as a sacrificial lamb to this skewed passion play.Well, Pedro is nothing if not a brave and lonely voice crying out in the wilderness of transgender impulse.  And his reflection of feminine ideals and realities has always been deep and true.  Not having grown up gay in such a machismo world makes it hard for one to devalue his passion--he is what he is and has his own stories to tell and axes to grind--but one non-exploitive or non-robotic male in this script wouldn't have shattered the solidarity of feminine suffering too much.  The omission really tells, just as eloquently, \"All About His Father.\"",

            "content": "This movie is typical Almod\u00f3var: strange situations, flashy colors, close to absurdity and with a strong presence of women. Yet, it's certainly not one of the best of this Spanish director.The story centers around a woman(Roth) who's just lost her son, being hit by a car, while pursuing another car with his favorite actress(Paredes)in it. The mother leaves for Madrid in order to set things straight and to find the boy's father, a transsexual named Lolo. Soon she finds herself in the company of three other women. Everything seems to get better until...The problem with this story is that it's just too much. After seeing this I tried to figure out why this film won almost every major award in Europe and every best foreign film award outside Europe. The only reason I could come up with was that Almod\u00f3var got rewarded for his entire career along with the fact that it's not always the best film that receives the honours. A look at the past oscar winners made me realize this: the charming but oh so predictable KOLYA, the idiotic BURNT BY THE SUN, or INDOCHINE(a year in which DAENS should have won it)... I think Almod\u00f3var's earlier CARNE TREMULA deserves the oscar more than his latest one. A good story, with interesting people, good actors and some original twists in it. TODO SOBRE was far too uneven on an emotional level to even compete with this one: just count the moments in TSMM when the characters are crying or when something tragic happens and you'll see what I mean. It's just too much, that you can't care about it anymore after a while.The acting too is uneven: Paredes and the beautiful Penelope Cruz are both wonderful in their parts. Cecilia Roth and some others however were less convincing. I honestly don't think that Almod\u00f3var deserved one of his best director awards either. It seems like he's letting it all run out of hand too easily.If you really want a good Spanish Almod\u00f3var comedy-drama, go rent CARNE TREMULA(LIVE FLESH). It's by far better than this soap-opera-wannabe-tearjerker. Don't get me wrong: it's amusing and has some wonderful moments, but it's just not worth the attention and praise it gets lately. 6/10",

            "content": "Is it possible to like a filmmaker even if you don't like, or have never seen, any of their influences?  Certainly, Pedro Almodovar provides a \"yes\" answer to that question for me.  Critics all over say one of his biggest influences is Douglas Sirk, director of movies like WRITTEN ON THE WIND, melodramas which I have avoided seeing since they usually star Rock Hudson, whom I'm not a big fan of.  Almodovar usually takes the melodrama form(some would say soap opera) and gives it a satiric twist.  When he likes the characters, as he did in LAW OF DESIRE and WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN(still his best film), the result is grand entertainment.  When he hates the characters, however(as in KIKA), the result is dismal.  For some people, Almodovar made a comeback with THE FLOWER OF MY SECRET, where he played straight what he normally played for satire, but I thought it was too much a soap opera to be affecting.Now he returns with ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER, and while there's quite a lot of comedy here, it's also played straight.  The difference here between this and THE FLOWER OF MY SECRET is the melodrama doesn't seem tacked on(except at the end, which goes on a little long and gets a little unbelievable), so the drama is affecting rather than tiresome.  Also, the acting is far superior; every one of the actors is quite good, but I think I liked the one who played the transvestite Agrado the best, who seemed determined to stay happy, no matter what.  Finally, I guess I can understand liking ALL ABOUT EVE and A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE more than I can understand liking romance novels(the occupation of the main character in FLOWER).  WOMEN ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN is still my favorite Almodovar, but this is good as well.",

            "content": "No one makes films quite like Pedro Almod\u00f3var. In an age where melodrama has been designated as a genre for trashy, low-brow entertainment, he wades through the rubbish pile and gives us All About My Mother, a seminal piece on navigating sexual and political identity in the modern age. The film marks a significant milestone in his provocative career. In his youth, his work reflected the turbulent Spanish contexts and societal upheavals he lived through, characterised by a stylistic luridness, of camp and eyeliner, of flashy kitsch and outrageous characters. Tina in Law of Desire is a deeply melodramatic figure, but she is also aware of her nature, and gives knowing winks to the audience. Almod\u00f3var's parody had distanced him from sincerity, but then came along Manuela, who is living in a melodrama, and yet the story compels our empathy, and the surprise of encountering this feeling. Manuela thinks she has escaped from her past, but with the inevitability of the coming tide, it rushes towards her and beckons a decision. A rainy night and an unsuspecting driver sends her son and the camera careening, and she is posed the same question that she performed for us in the opening: Will you give your loved one's organs up for donation? This is not just Almod\u00f3var's playfulness at work, but the genre crying out: self-reflexivity, mirrored realities, a dramatic collision of past and present. Witness the slow motion of her anguish, and the mournful strings as she signs away her son's body. What would the back cover say? A part of her is missing, and this is her journey to reclaim herself. The style is arresting, and provocatively draws attention to itself - Almod\u00f3var has gained sincerity but lost none of his theatrical edge. The stage background is drenched in a melancholic blue, and the lead actress wears gold, but listen to the recital of Stanley Kowalski's famous line. It's barely a whimper, and Stella is already too far away to be seduced. The character, more animal than man, as Marlon Brando showed us, is reduced to pathetic stage dressing. The father, who also occupied the role, is now called Lola, and Rosa's father, a blank slate. The world is Manuela's stage, as Almod\u00f3var indicates, punctuating the frame with red hair, lips, costumes, pushing his actors through zany mise en sc\u00e8ne (her new apartment is a kaleidoscopic museum), weaving Tennessee Williams' lines into the dialogue of the everyday. She must perform constantly, keeping her grief at bay, feigning a more capable identity, and helping others claim theirs (she is Rosa's sister, because it presents a better look). Centre stage, ironically, is the only place where she can afford to take off her mask, a safe space from judgement and stigmatisation. Stella, and therefore Manuela, is allowed to weep openly, and the moment is emotionally cathartic (she even sports a fake belly!). Theatre is more real than reality, and it is Manuela's escape route from the harshness of life's dealt hand, but also a way of engaging with her grief. The stoic facade is discarded, and the tears flow so freely. And what are the men of the cast doing? They are being coached on their emotional projection: \"The sadness should go into your hands. You have to work it,\" instructs the director. This gloss is reminiscent of none other than the king of melodrama, Douglas Sirk. His work in the 50s were the romance novels of today (just look at their posters), adorned with roses, white picket fences, sweeping romance narratives, and lush Technicolor. But what the sheen concealed was an attack on classism, and the conformist ideologies of Eisenhower's suburbia. Today, seeing Jane Wyman's face imprisoned by the frame of the television, it seems obvious. Todd Haynes would try his hand at melodrama, updating Sirk's style with a modern exploration of homophobia. But while Far from Heaven is merely a renovated period piece, bursting at the seams with weepy and strained acting, All About My Mother cuts through it all. Almod\u00f3var isn't just subtly pushing critique through irony, he's dropping glittery bombshells and eradicating sexual conformity, gender taboos and traditional values. And alongside Manuela's lifelong journey, he is shattering and reconstructing the nuclear family paradigm with his own zany personalities. Agrado is the film's main source of warmth, but more vitally, humour. While the music is pulsating and tensions are at bursting point, she sashays in and disarms the scene with a witty remark and a healthy dose of self-depreciation. Almost overnight she has eased the doubts of Huma Rojo, two years on becoming her most trusted companion and confidant. And in the film's most liberating scene, she struts out under the spotlights after (melo)drama backstage cancels the night's performance. But what an opportunity the plot presents her with! She has been living on the fringes of society, shunned but for a select clientele, yet here she is on centre stage. She rattles off the prices of her plastic surgeries, so numerous that she resembles Theseus' ship, no longer made of the original model's pieces. Yet she is stronger and more confident than ever, so utterly sure of her role in life, and radiating authenticity in spite of the work done on her body. This is beauty and femininity and warmth all wrapped into one, not as a physical ideal, but as an fluid identity. And what Agrado has helped reshape Manuela into is so much more than just a mother.",

There is a parallel story infused with high camp and acceptance of people in the margins of society. In this case transsexuals making a living though vice.Manuela (Cecilia Roth) is a nurse who works in the transplant unit at a Madrid hospital. She lives with her son Esteban,a budding writer who she has raised on her own. She has told him nothing about his father.

This was also when the awards recognition poured in. Actually, it is a co-production between Spain and France, but the former is absolutely dominant here in terms of who made this film, who starred in it and also where it is set. A lot of it is in Barcelona which made me curious because I traveled there not too long ago. But that is another story. It is not a long movie at all at minimally over 100 minutes, but that is alright. I am glad it did not run for any longer. The man in charge of all this was Pedro Almod\u00f3var and he was already 50 when this came out and had worked on more than just a few films before and was thus also somewhat known. At least in Spain. But the fact that this film did not only won the foreign language category back then, but pretty much swept awards ceremonies all over the planet was extremely impressive and meant an international breakthrough for him. I have seen some of his films since then and enjoyed them. To be honest, I liked most of them (much) more than I liked this film here. I would not call him a personal favorite, but there is something about Almod\u00f3var and his style that I really appreciate and this among other aspects mostly refers to colors he uses. Of the connection between the colors red and blue, but especially how he uses the color red in terms of sets, pictures, furniture even and clothes and just many other ways. Impossible to name every single one of them. But it is such a distinctive feature and it caught my eye right away in this film too. He did not only direct, but also wrote the film as he almost always does, so he was the man more in charge than anybody here.About the cast I cannot say too much. The lead actress here is Cecilia Roth, who is from Argentina despite the name. This film is definitely her by far most known work to this day and the huge breakthrough for her did not follow. Maybe age was a bit of a problem as she was already in her early 40s here, which should not be a problem, but perhaps was. In any case, this was not at all the first time (or only time) she collaborated with Almod\u00f3var and she also scored a great amount of awards recognition for her portrayal here. The actress from this fairly female-dominated cast that most will immediately recognize is of course Pen\u00e9lope Cruz. You can really call her Almod\u00f3var's muse or call him her mentor with all the other films for which they joined forces, many of them having Cruz as the lead actress. Here she was still in her early 20s and plays a bit of a tragic character, actually one of several tragic characters. Almost every character here is tragic in a way you could say. This also applies to the main character and what she goes through at the start, namely lose her son in a car accident. It was almost a bit ironic in a fairly sad fashion how there is talk about donating organs and very early on also this little informational video about how people think they are talking about the one they love getting organs from somebody else. This accident in a way could have been the core essence of the entire film, but Almod\u00f3var chose a completely different direction and this fateful event was more of a beckground setting back then when the female protagonist goes to another city where she meets the boy's father. And this meeting also could have been really at the center of it all, but it is not. Only takes place at the end then when she receives another sad message, but the center of the film is really all that happens in-between. The people she meets there (again) and the impact they have on her life and also the other way around.I guess many people loved this film because of how it felt really progressive in terms of dealing with trans people. We have two key characters here who fall into that category. One we only see at the very end, but he is still vital in terms of the story. The other we see on many occasions throughout the film, but he is admittedly not that vital in terms of the plot. The film could have had the same story without him pretty much. What I liked was that they did not really have to send out any specific messages against hate or pro tolerance. These people were simply there living their lives and that is/was how it should be. No need to rub everything into everybody's faces the way it is sadly done nowadays in 50% of the films dealing with similar subjects. Probably more. Or LBGT in general. Here it was done right. Still, I must say the film caused some problems for me in other areas. In the end, it was just too much plot-wise to feel realistic. Almod\u00f3var put in so much here in slightly over 1.5 hours. The boy's death early on. The father's death at the very end. Cruz's character's death. The almost biological miracle how the baby recovered in the end. The way how early on one character is physically attacked (could have gotten killed without somebody else's interference), but then still protects the attacker in a way. The way how two characters, a lesbian couple apparently, really violently attack each other. And so on. There are more examples. It simply did not feel too authentic anymore. Just too much. On a more positive note, what I personally found interesting here was the inclusion of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" on quite a few inclusions, even if you could surely make a point that how this play impacted the main character's life on several occasions was a bit too much coincidence to still feel credible. But let's be gentle, so they (i.e. Almod\u00f3var) can get away with this too, even if it feels difficult. I do wanna watch the old black-and-white film now too that won everybody an Oscar except Brando. That one came out not too soon already after the base material got written. That is another story/film though.So yeah, for me this film was closer to 2 stars out of 5 than to 4 stars out of 5. Much closer and with 3 out of 5 I am surely still very much on the generous side all in all I would say. The success with all these awards it won and again almost the same amount it was nominated for (a combined total of 100 approximately) really does surprise me and it is not possible for me to agree with that. Almod\u00f3var surely had some strikes of genius during his career, but his 1999 film is not top-notch material. Still, there is a lot more from this movie you can discuss here, for example how he has no problem at all with including big jumps ahead in time on more than one occasion. You can surely call Almod\u00f3var's effort here unhinged and also bold in a way even if far from everything turned out right. Maybe that is what people loved about this film back then and still love about it today, even if obviously especially members of the LBGT community adore it nowadays because of how much ahead of its time it was in that department and also how Almod\u00f3var made other films linked to these definitely important issues in the over 20 years since \"Todo sobre mi madre\". But what else can you say about this movie here that has not been said? I guess not too much anymore. Favorite scenes everybody will have others I guess. There was not one or two that stayed absolutely in the mind for everybody I think. Maybe this is another aspect people like(d) about the film that most appreciated it from very different angles compared to what the people they watched it with saw in specific scenes. Other scenes. But for me the sour aftertaste stays with lack of realism on many occasions. Also another example would be that the mother, i.e. The protagonist, is ready to tell her son about his father's real identity the very night when the boy is killed.To end the review on a more positive note, I would say I kinda liked how Almod\u00f3var included the existence and impact of HIV in this film in an utterly subtle, yet effective manner, especially in terms of the circles of society where it was a really, really big problem. More than anywhere else. I am glad I went to watch this movie, even if it did not have the very biggest impact on me in the end and I can only give it a cautiously positive recommendation. You should watch other releases from the filmmaker before this one for sure. Such as the magnificent \"Broken Embraces\". I am still glad that \"All About My Mother\" was shown at one of my local theaters and also that the (big) room was pretty packed, not sold out, not even close, but still fairly full and I think this is one of so many recent examples of how old(er) films really attract so much attention from movie-goers and should be shown on as many occasions as possible. That is all then. Oh and by the way, don't think this is a film particularly suitable to watch on Mother's Day because of the title or so. On the contrary, I would rather not call it a rewarding fit for this occasion. Still, go see \"Todo sobre mi madre\". Once is enough.",

It had the effect of drawing even more attention to the title of this film, \"Todo sobre mi madre\". It was also noteworthy that he provided an homage of sorts to two American movie classics, the other being \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". As for this story, I'm not quite sure what to make of it all. Try as I might, I can't imagine someone of basically a normal disposition like Manuela (Cecilia Roth) to be involved in so many dysfunctional relationships as she encountered in Barcelona. The search for her deceased son's father and her ex-husband was noble, but the journey revealed an entire retinue of people that would make your skin crawl under normal circumstances. The topper was the transsexual Lola (Toni Cant\u00f3), who turned out to be the ex-husband, and also the father of a baby by a nun! It would have to be explained how that relationship ever came about, as the circumstance is presented as given which is just too much of a fantastical stretch to warrant consideration.I don't know much about director Almod\u00f3var, other than what I've read on his IMDb bio page, but if this picture is any indication, it appears that he goes for something of shock value to his stories. Which is OK I guess, but it would have the tendency to put off some viewers with his odd characters and even odder situations. It's curious how he attempts to convey the humanity of his characters, but it's also enlightening to know how he actually describes some of them - \"If I lived like my characters, I would have been dead before I made sixteen films\".

Basically Manuela (Cecilia Roth), mother of Esteban (Eloy Azor\u00edn) is travelling from Madrid to Barcelona to tell the son's father the news of Esteban's death (hit by car trying to get actress's autograph). There she becomes friends with his connections, including transvestite prostitute Agrado (Antonia San Juan), actress Huma Rojo (Marisa Paredes), co-actress Nina (Candela Pe\u00f1a) and nun Sister Mar\u00eda Rosa Sanz (Captain Corelli's Pen\u00e9lope Cruz). The film is not just about Manuela or her connection to the play A Streetcar Named Desire, but the other character stories. Including Agrado's prostitution acts and self confidence (she even talks about her surgery and costs on stage in front of an audience), and Sister Rosa who is pregnant with the father, Lola's (Toni Cant\u00f3) baby, and HIV positive. A very moving Spanish film with some good use of camera-work and cinematography. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, it won the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it was nominated for Best Original Screenplay, it won the Cannes Film Festival Awarx for Best Director, the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury, and Almod\u00f3var was nominated the Golden Palm, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

And Almodovar's style, not as crazy as in his past films but just as uncompromising, suits the story. A 17 year old dies, a transvestite is his father, and many other things. Yet, they were all necessary for this drama that is also good (yet different) for Almodovar, who won best foreign film for 1999 at the Oscars. The best part of all though, I could understand how the characters thought and acted more on a second viewing. This was a good film, but the drama is laid so thick it makes Sophie's Choice look like Dumb and Dumber; yet it's Almodovar all the way, even in the midst of harrowing, very human drama. A-",

Frankly I Just don't see that. This widely praised film has all traditional ingredients one has come to expect the illustrious director to contain in his personal statements. Sensitive homage to females and mothers, stimulating character dialogs, a solid cast, good score, some great shots...so why did, what some may consider quintessential Almod\u00f3var, the movie feel unexpectedly limp? It boils down to a matter of believability. We have seen how this writer-director has combined an offbeat surrealism against normal, almost boring routine, often creating the low-key, gently menacing undercurrents to showcase his love for the ladies. Here though, Almod\u00f3var breaks into conflict too soon in the film, negating much of an emotional reaction to the majority of proceedings. What transpires is a mildly entertaining and involving, but certainly emotionally manipulative patented Almod\u00f3var soap opera, complete with unnecessary back-story mystique, counterproductive eccentricities, and showy plot revelations.We will see essentially the same thing done, and better, from this filmmaker. All About My Mother is not the definitive Almod\u00f3var some may claim, far from it. But it is still the work of a man who has always marched to the beat of his own drum, and throughout his career, has perfected that drum beat almost to a science. No one will accuse him of being overly diverse, but Almod\u00f3var continues to prove time and again why he is a unique voice in the film world, one of the few giants out there who longs to portray women with the class they deserve.",

It is a more serious films, less soap opera, than other fine films like 'Mujeres al Borde de un Ataque de Nervios' and 'Tacone Lejanos'. It seems Almod\u00f3var is growing up and it fits him. We still have the bright colors and there still is one (or two) transsexual character, but both are used in a more serious way.Here he tells the story of Manuela (Cecilia Roth), a woman who who loses her son while he is purchasing famous Huma Rojo (Marisa Paredes) to get an autograph. He is hit by a car. Now Manuela wants to find her son's father, transvestite Lola (Toni Cant\u00f3), to tell him the bad news. She meets her old friend Agrado (Antonia San Juan), a nun named Rosa (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz) who also knows Lola, and due circumstances she becomes Huma's assistant. As with every Almod\u00f3var film it is hard to explain the plot without revealing too much. His films always inhabit a lot of characters important for the story in one way or another.Although the story on itself is a very good one, there are little things I enjoyed very much. The way he shows us certain things and let them return later in the film. We get to see parts of 'All About Eve' for example, and later the main plot line of that film is mixed into this story. Another example shows Manuela as an actress in an instruction video where people have to decide whether they agree with a heart transplant of their dead relative, which ironically returns when she has to make that kind of choice for her own son.Of course there is the usual amount of comedy, especially when transsexual Agrado is in the picture. The cinematography is good, especially in combination with the colors we always see in an Almod\u00f3var film. Very memorable is the important music. Alberto Iglesias has composed a beautiful score, even used in commercials these days, that fits the film perfectly. Although I like every film of Almod\u00f3var since they are so different from other films, I do think this is one of his best. It is probably better accessible than most of his earlier films with a more familiar story. Fortunately the Almod\u00f3var touch is felt all the way through the film.",

This movie shows also how thin is sometimes the line between marginality and the so called good behaviour in people's lives.

The performance of all the actresses is very good especially that of Antonia San Juan in the role of a very intelligent and sensitive drag queen.

Every movie is a challenge and every time you'll find yourself being fascinated by the (sometimes weird) characters and the gripping story.With this movie he has done exactly that, he has made a very touching but sometimes weird movie. It's about a single mother, Manuela, who lives with her only son in Madrid. He dies on his 17th birthday as he runs to seek an actress's autograph and gets hit by a car. The father, a transvestite who works as a prostitute in Barcelona, didn't even know he had a son, let alone that he knows the kid died. The mother decides that she'll pay him a visit and tell him all about his son. Looking for him (her), she meets Rosa, a young nun who is about to leave for El Salvador. A beautiful friendship between the two women starts and as the story goes on, they will help each other through some very hard times (Rosa appears to be pregnant and HIV-positive). In the meantime Manuela has also started working as the personal assistant of the same actress her son wanted an autograph from...What makes this movie so special is the fact that even though the story is very special and certainly not the easiest to follow, it all works very well. You'll get an enormous mix of emotions and you'll see plenty of characters who in one way or another have something to do with each other, but it will all fit right into its place. At the end of the movie you will not be asking yourself questions, at least not when you have been able to pay enough attention all the time. OK, it may look weird from time to time (you certainly wouldn't find these characters in a Hollywood production), but in the end it all seems 'normal'.Pedro Almod\u00f3var doesn't have to prove his talents for story telling and directing anymore, I'm already convinced that he knows all about it, but this movie wouldn't have worked if he hadn't chosen the right actors. And I can only say that all the actors did a very good job.

But otherwise, he gets wonderful performances from the female cast, especially Cecilia Roth, who plays the key character in the film. Featuring many parallels to mothers and their responsibilities, I found individual events fascinating; however it was also terribly disjointed therefore I never felt truly involved (despite Almod\u00f3var's visual approach). The use of colour was wonderful. The plot is after Manuela's (Cecilia Roth) son dies in a car accident, she confides herself to her past friends for comfort (in which she discovers what they've been doing). With new responsibilities she tries to be a perfect mother and right her wrongs.7/10",

            "content": "This is my first experience with a film directed by the acclaimed Spanish film maker, Pedro Almod\u00f3var. It is very complex on both a technical and emotional level.It is first and foremost a kind of absurdist parody of contemporary life with Almod\u00f3var simultaneously questioning bourgeois values and celebrating the community of those with alternative life styles. He makes the burghers in the audience feel uneasy in their assumptions, especially about questions of gender and about the lifestyle of cross-dressers and gender-unspecific/variable people, who, he wants us to know, live and breath and love and hate just like anybody else.Cecile Roth stars as Manuela, who is a nurse at a hospital in Madrid where she helps to coordinate the organ donor programs. She is also an amateur actress who plays in the simulations that the hospital makes to educate staff and patients. Her 17-year-old son with whom she is very close tells her she is a great actress, but Manuela is modest. She is also secretive about his father's identity. After seeing a production of Tennessee Williams's A Streetcar Named Desire, the son and the mother await outside the stage door so that he can get an autograph from the actress who plays Blanche Dubois, Marisa Paredes, who is named Huma Rojo in the film. Tragedy ensues as the son is hit and fatally injured. In just one of a number of plot mixings that emphasize the sometimes tragic and often ironic nature of the human experience, the son becomes an organ donor before he dies, and Manuela, who had previously arranged for organ donations, now has to sign the papers to donate the organs of her beloved son.Now she goes to Barcelona to look up the father, who had once played the crude and boorish Stanley Kowalski to her Stella, again from A Streetcar Named Desire. In Barcelona Manuela again sees the play, but this time meets the star, Huma, who is a grande old dame of the Spanish theater, a Lesbian genius who has taken her theatrical cue in life from Bette Davis (and her smoking habits as well). In a salute to Davis and a remembrance of one of her greatest roles, we see posters of Bette Davis from the classic Hollywood film, All About Eve (1950), and then a kind of take off on the action as Manuela becomes in a sense Eve Harrington as she befriends Huma and begins working for her. (Waiting outside the stage door for a autograph is also a scene from All About Eve.) Nina (Candela Pe\u00f1a) Huma's heroin-addicted lover becomes jealous and accuses Manuela of seeking Huma's friendship just so she can become a star herself, a la Eve Harrington. To top it off Manuela is called upon to play Stella when Nina cannot because of an overdose, and miraculously she relives her role from twenty years before, and does a great job, because she is, as her son knew, a gifted actress.Okay, we can see the complexities. I have merely given the premise of the film. Enter now Antonia San Juan as Agrado, an old friend of Manuela's who is a professional transvestite. (San Juan is brilliant in the part as a woman playing a man playing a woman.) Enter also Pen\u00e9lope Cruz as a pregnant nun with AIDs. What evolves is a kind of sisterhood among variously gendered females. There is also a sense of a middle class, soap opera-ish even, action and resolution, but with Almod\u00f3var's tongue firmly in cheek.Men, however, do not come off very well in this film. The grandfather-to-be apparently has Alzheimer's and does not even recognize his daughter. Manuela's son is dead. A theater male is depicted as a kind of stagehand Stanley Kowalski, boorishly insensitive, seeking only his own pleasure; indeed Tennessee Williams's crude, animalistic Kowalski appears as a metaphor for men in this film. Manuela is his long-suffering Stella, and Huma has always, as she actually says, depended on the kindness of strangers. Finally, there is \"Lola\" a tall, handsome, gender-modified Kowalski, played inadequately by Toni Cant\u00f3, in what may be a bit of purposely bad casting for effect by Almod\u00f3var--or perhaps I should say, played shallowly and unconvincingly on purpose by Toni Cant\u00f3. It's hard to tell. Indeed part of Almod\u00f3var's technique is a blurring of distinctions with ironic parallels, showing how some things are the same, but different depending on your point of view, the organ donors, Lola's fatherhood, Manuela as Stella and/or Eve, etc.Bottom line this is an unsettling film, brilliantly acted by Paredes, Roth and San Juan, and cleverly directed in a most original style by Almod\u00f3var. It will not play well with Disney aficionados or with devotees of action cinema--and put the kiddies to bed, please.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)",

            "content": "Writer - Director Pedro Almodovar has a reputation for original and mildly shocking portraits of, shall we say, non-mainstream Spanish sexuality, usually delivered with plenty of cinematographic flair and a fair amount of frivolity. Hence \"High Heels\", \"Tie me Up, Tie me Down!\" \"Live Flesh\" etc. This film continues the tradition but in rather more serious vein. It touches on acting, transvestism, organ transplants (no, not that organ), senility, HIV, pregnancy, single motherhood, mother-daughter and mother-son relationships and a father-daughter non-relationship. The film is dedicated to all those great actresses who played actresses (Bette Davis for example in All About Eve). Inevitably as with Bette Davis they wind up playing or parodying themselves, though Marisa Paredes puts in a restrained performance here as the great Huma.The central character is Manuela, a nurse and former amateur actress from Barcelona working in an organ transplant unit in Madrid, who has a 17 year old son by a man who disappeared before her son was born. After her son is killed in an accident she goes back to Barcelona to find the father but instead gets involved with a leading actress and her young junkie girlfriend, a truck driver turned transvestite and a pregnant nun with HIV. Yet this is not a comic film. Odd people have problems that are no less real than anyone else's. Almodovar shows us the overwhelming grief of a mother for her son and the way we tolerate dreadful behaviour by our partners in the name of love. Barcelona is in so many scenes it might almost be a character and the whole thing is very prettily done, but not so as to detract from the film's central themes. Personally I find tranvestism (as opposed to transsexuality) difficult to understand - why does one need to dress up as a woman to get off as a man (as opposed to getting it off with a man)? The trannies here are the big brassy sort. In a fairly macho society as Spain apparently is, it seems that sex roles need to be clearly delineated and hence a feminine man needs high heels, big breasts and lots of make-up.\nDespite the implausible plot and strange characters this is a moving tale adroitly told and lusciously filmed. Almodovar does like to keep us entertained and the film is not a moment too long.",

That it covers them all, without them cluttering not only the entire script, but us, also, is a major achievement. Somehow they work alongside each other, fitting in, often awkwardly - and for once, the lovely Penelope Cruz is the relatively plain and 'normal' one - and a modern day nun at that!Playing around the two film's (All About Eve & A Streetcar Named Desire) themes is a way of keeping some semblance of continuity, ones that viewers might first be drawn to and then to expand from. Having re-watched All About Eve again recently, I was pre-armed to see how it might all fit in.It would be knee-jerk reactionary to say something like \"Everybody should see this\" and \"Everybody would be more tolerant, if they watched this\", however much one feels the need to do so. Somehow, it is a private gem that however much we think others are tolerant and open- minded, our parents - for example - would simply either be just too shocked or bogged down almost immediately as to who-was-doing-what-and-to-who.One of those colourful vignettes of modern, societal Spain, as individual as Gaudi himself.

Nevertheless, the acting was outstanding: Cecilia Roth as Manuela, Marisa Paredes as the actress playing Blanche in recurring scenes from \"Street Car Named Desire,\" Candela Pena as Nina, her drug-dependent lesbian lover, who also appears as Stella in the play, Antonia San Juan as a transsexual whore who is Manuela's friend but not the one who impregnated her, Penelope Cruz as the pregnant nun, and Rosa Maria Sarda as the mother with whom Cruz' character has a difficult relationship. The actual transsexual father of both women's children doesn't show up until late in the movie and that was also confusing. Add in the AIDS which kills both the nun and the trans-sexual father and this is one hell of a mixture. I don't know that it is as good a movie as most of the critics say it is but, especially when seen on a small screen with fleeting subtitles (a scene in the theatre in which Antonia San Juan does a stand up routine eluded me entirely), it's difficult to come to a definitive conclusion.

Such is the case with Todo Sobre Mi Madre..... and after all the noise it made winning its Oscar, I was somewhat sceptical, as previous films by Almod\u00f3ver had left me completely unmoved: a lot of childish surrealism and rather crazy story lines with what would seem to be a womaniser surrounding himself with all the healthiest young actresses he could find.... Having said that, it is time to correct a few ideas. TODO SOBRE MI MADRE is a great piece of cinema. Almod\u00f3var has at last matured, and has established that he really is an intelligent cinematographer. This film belongs to the theatre genre - which is why we have Cecilia Roth, Marisa Paredes and Rosa Mar\u00eda Sard\u00e1 (please see her in `Las Amargas L\u00e1grimas de Petra von Kant' (TV) (2001) ) in leading r\u00f4les, all having theatre experience, and Antonia San Juan as Agrado is worth an Oscar all to herself - brilliant. And.... Penelope Cruz: yes, lovely, she reminds me of why I came to Spain to live so many years ago; she played her part excellently. Brilliant directing here by Almod\u00f3ver: he really got his own script to work beautifully. He manages the characteriology to great depths, bringing out the best possible interpretations by everybody.

Far superior to `American Beauty which so captivated audiences world-wide in 1999. It is also a pity that Spain can only send ONE film for nomination each year, as another very worthy competitor got left out, undeservedly: `Solas' is also a great piec e of theatre-cinema, well worth seeing if you liked `Todo Sobre mi Madre'.

High-strung, hysterical, and over-plotted soap opera: you either sit back and submit to the emotional roller-coaster or you leave the theater; there is no in-between.I stayed and enjoyed myself because visually the film has enough sensual body to transcend its own operatic monkeyshines: richly saturated with color and resplendent with forms, it offers up images that are often as empassioned as the drama: a high-caloric eye candy. It's much too rare these days to find anyone making films with even the slightest cognizance of the fact that film is a plastic medium. Whatever else may be said of him, Almodovar at least has a deep, instinctive, highly imaginative sense of the connection between feelings and images: for example, the pedestrian accident, the geography and architecture of Madrid and Barcelona, the choreography of whores and cars in \"the field,\" the illusion of the hospital floor level with the sea, and tunneling through time in a train tunnel.The hypercharged emotionalism, a Hispanic and homosexual double whammy, bears no relation to reality, in fact, insults it. Almodovar sexualizes emotions that have nothing to do with gender, inviting politically correct responses such as this one, from that bastion of PC mind-wash, the San Francisco Bay Guardian : \" All About My Mother is a meticulous examination of the roles women play, in grief, in love, and, literally, on stage.\" But such are the times we live in, where fallopian tubes and a uterus supposedly determine whether or not one can feel honestly and spontaneously. (Gender capitalistic consumer niches have been personalized ad nauseum.)Quite ironically it is the soulful, even masculine, grounding of the superb acting of Cecilia Roth that anchors this film, keeps it from whizzing up and away in its own excesses and camp. Just about everyone else in the cast also keeps a tight trim, which, I am sure, reflects some degree of directorial circumspection amidst all the frenzy.Intellectually the movie is cotton candy, all sugar and air. Leitmotivs referencing All About Eve and A Streetcar Named Desire frame the film. These references, less than profound, are like a sophomore's highlighting. (Almodovar pulled the same trick in Live Flesh by putting Bunuel's The Exterminating Angel on a TV in the background, only to have it backfire by contrasting its sterling high quality to his own cheesiness.)Would I see Almodovar's next film? Definitely. Why? Because he's fresh, fun, doesn't repeat himself, and, most importantly, he honors the medium he deals in; his films look like films.",

She gets a role dripping with juice and she milks it for all it's worth. Roth is natural and subtle as well as heartrending like when she loses her son. From the other five actresses she takes an individual journey with Penelope Cruz is the standout as a pregnant nun who is HVI positive.

One is transvestites. Almodovar handles it nicely making it so they aren't viewed as monsters or strange. Another is it's femininity. Almost every actor here is female and this film takes a stand as a feminist film. What Almodovar can't do is what Paris Hilton can't buy.

It gets onto a subject that seems really interesting if the film-maker would take the time to really look at it but instead it immediately jumps to the next thing that could cause potential tears. Furthermore, the main character, Manuela, was too perfect, even for a movie. It got to the point where I would not be surprised by any outrageous thing that was part of her past.  I think a lot of people are going to go see this movie with high expectations thanks to the Oscar and leave very disappointed.",

His descent into melodrama struck me as more telenovela than Douglas Sirk; and ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER, acclaimed around the world as his masterpiece, seems to make itself up as it goes along--not in a free-booted way, in a half-assed way. But Almodovar's heart is so clearly in every frame of this tribute to maternality real and fictional that it's impossible to come away unmoved. Cecilia Roth plays the mother--an amalgam of Eve Harrington, Stella Kowalski, and a few Gena Rowlands roles--who seems fated to outlive her real and invented children. Almodovar often here seems to be working with scotch tape and rubber cement, but Roth's luminousness, and the almost surgical power of Alfredo Iglesias' score, produce a crashing-tide surfeit of emotion that makes quibbling seem petty. I can't think of another queer director in mainstream movies who made such an unabashed and personal work of tribute to femininity in all its guises--biological, pretend, unconscious.

The acting is first-class, particularly from Cecilia Roth, whose cries of \"Hijo m\u00edo\" (\"My son\") as her son Esteban lies dying in her arms is powerful enough to wrench the heart of even the most even the most hardened film watcher.The events that follow provide an interesting vision of women in all situations (and by contrast, the role of men is an interesting one to watch - Padre H. Rosa is unflinching and unforgiving, Esteban is the ideal son is lifted to almost iconic status, and Antonia San Juan is excellent as the prostitute transsexual).  Indeed, the Spanish seem to have encountered a fascination of women in the last couple of years - another notable example is Benito Zembrano\u00b4s \"Solas\".As a piece of cinema from which to study Spanish, you could do a lot worse than see this film.  It isn`t as visual as \"El Milagro de P.Tinto\", for example, but it is relatively easy to keep up with the events.  (However, Agrado (the prostitute) speaks with a very strong regional accent which is tough for the novice (like myself) to make head or tail of).\"Todo Sobre Mi Madre\" is an honest and powerful film, and one that deserves to be seen.

            "content": "This film won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film in 2000. Its title is a variation on All About Eve, and the film seems to an homage to Bette Davis. It often refers to All About My Mother as well as A Streetcar Named Desire, perhaps an homage to Tennessee Williams, too.The film begins in Madrid where a single mother, nurse, and organ transplant coordinator, Manuela (Cecilia Roth), lives with her sensitive 17-year-old son, Esteban (Eloy Azor\u00edn), an aspiring young writer. It is his birthday and the two watch a Spanish-dubbed version of All About My Mother on TV. It is then that Esteban apparently changes the title of his memories (Notes) to All About My Mother. Since Esteban is an aspiring writer, Manuela gives him a copy of Truman Capote's Music of Chameleons as an early birthday present. Later, she takes him to see, A Streetcar Named Desire, which is currently running in Madrid. The play moves Manuela to tears; Esteban asks her why she is crying; she tells him that she and his father once worked in that same play together, with her playing Stella and his father playing Kowalski. Esteban demands to know more about his father; and she promises to tell him later that night, as a favor to him on his birthday. After the play, Estaban is killed in a car accident while trying to get an autograph of the play's leading actress, Huma Rojo (Marisa Paredes). With his death, she is asked to donate HIS heart to an unknown recipient at the same transplant center where she works. Depressed and alone, Manuela decides to return to the Barcelona of her youth. There, she hopes to find Estaban's father and tell him all about his son. Upon arriving in Barcelona, she has a taxi take her to the red light district. There, she runs into Agrado (Antonia San Juan), an old friend of hers who used to live with her husband, Lola, before Lola robbed Agrado of all of her belongings to run off to Argentina. (Agarado and Lola were a transsexual couple; both were men who became women at the same time.) After seeing (and literally being rescued by) Manuela, Agarado decides to stop whoring and get a real job. To find new jobs, the two friends go to a Catholic Mission in the district. There, they meet Sister Mar\u00eda Rosa (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), a young nun who is about to be sent to El Salvador to replace a nun that was killed there by guerrilla fighters. Agrado and Manuela tell Rosa that they are willing take almost any job. But, knowing there are no jobs, Rosa tries to get her mother to hire Manuela as a cook (or perhaps, help care for her father who has Alzheimer's. Thinking Manuela came into the mission as a whore, Rosa's mother (Rosa Maria Sard\u00e0) tells them that she doesn't need any help. After the two leave Rosa's parents house, Rosa becomes sick. Manuela finds out that Rosa is about three months pregnant, and Manuela accompanies her to a doctor's office to get her first pregnancy checkup. There, Rosa asks for an AIDS blood test since she works in a high-risk job as a social worker. Two weeks later, she learns that she is HIV positive. When Manuela asks if she knows who the father is, Rosa tells her that it is Lola. Here, Manuela goes into a slight rage asking (telling) her that Lola has been shooting drugs for YEARS and asking her why she didn't know any better. With Rosa starting to 'show,' she has to leave the mission and stay with Manuela. A big part of Manuela's job is to keep as much of Rosa's pregnancy as simple as she can for Rosa's conventional mother. (After all, it is bad enough that her unwed daughter, a nun, became pregnant at all. Why tell her that the father is a HIV-positive transsexual drug addict, too?) One night, Manuela goes to see Streetcar Named Desire again in Barcelona (with the same cast that had played in Madrid the night Esteban was killed). When Manuela goes backstage to see Huma Rojo in person, she passes Huma's personal assistant, Nina (Candela Pe\u00f1a), running out the back door. Nina, who plays Stella in SND is also Huma's lover and personal assistant. But, she is totally unreliable since she is hooked on drugs. Huma needs to find Nina and asks Manuela to help find her. After they find her in the red light district, Nina and Huma drive off leaving Manuela behind. One night when Nina is bombed out of her mind, Manuela tells Huma that SHE can play the part of Stella and IS ABLE to pull it off in one performance, saving Huma's contract. When Nina returns, she accuses Manuela of sabotaging her career, just like Eve Harrington did in AAE. When Huma asks Manuela for an explanation, she breaks down and tells them about her husband, her son and how he died in the car accident while trying to get Huma's autograph in Madrid. When Huma asks Manuela to continue as her assistant, Manuela tells her that she must spend time caring for Rosa and suggests that Agrado take the job, which she does.Since I am getting close to the story's climax, I will stop the plot description here to avoid stepping into any possible SPOILERS. However, I will say that plot continues to play out like an extended soap opera on a vivid pastel stage. All issues are 'resolved' in one way or another. But, to me, the story is still very contrived and way too complex to be effective in delivering any sort of central message or emotion. One could almost read any message into the movie. Maybe that is why the film appeals to so many people: I mean, I'm just saying.....",

            "content": "One nice thing when watching a movie like \"Todo sobre mi madre\" is knowing that you'd never get to experience something like this from a Hollywood movie. There is not a chance that Hollywood would risk alienating its audience by having them fraternise with people who practice a variety of different sexualities, as we have here.The story is fairly simple. Manuela loses her son Estaban and, as a result, goes back to her roots in an effort to come to terms with her grief. This involves meeting with her trans-sexual prostitute friend Agrado, Estaban's transvestite father Lola, and the lesbian theatre actress Huma. These alternate takes on the idea of feminity are central to the theme of \"Todo sobre mi madre\" and what it means to love as a woman. Indeed it's a great credit to writer and director Pedro Almod\u00f3var, that he managed to get inside the women's head so well.The acting is all spot on. The characters breathe dimension. In spite of their relatively abnormal style of living, they come across as real people. I particularly enjoyed the caustic Agrado. As a result their emotional trauma is all the more affecting. However I felt, as I often have before, that Pen\u00e9lope Cruz gave in the weakest performance of the leads, out-matched by her peers. Naturally being the prettiest it was her that eventually clawed into Hollywood. Such is the way of Tinsel Town.Almod\u00f3var lends a thoughtful air to the proceedings. Weeks, and even months go by, in a single second as he chooses to swoop in now and then at central points in Manuela's life as she learn to deal with Esteban's death and move on with her own life - part of which is reconciling with her own life and that of Esteban's estranged father. The constant use of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", viewed from afar by Manuela and then finally engaged in is suitably symbolic of her own progression towards recovery.\"Todo sobre mi madre\" is undoubtedly a well crafted movie in many respects. Based on my own tastes, it will never be a favourite movie of mine, but I can appreciate it for what it is. It deservedly won a Best Foreign Film Oscar (and a slew of other Best Foreign Film awards) and is recommended viewing. 7.3/10.",

The film removes any emotion it may have had by obviously trying to get us to accept transvestites as normal, but it just winds up comming off as a pretentious freak show. Fans of Almodovar will probably be able to appreciate this chick flick more than I can, and don't get me wrong, I don't mind chick flicks terribly, but this one in my view is just tosh.

            "content": "\"All About My Mother\" is an extremely well put together film that is an intriguing combination of art-house and Oscar bait. Almodorav has managed to put together a movie with a strong emotional core all the while making some interesting stylistic choices. At the heart of this movie is a story of a mother come to terms with the recent death of her only son on his 17th birthday. We see her give up her life in Madrid as a nurse and return to Barcelona where she had a more tumultuous life before moving to Madrid.The movie does an excellent job establishing the relationship between the mother and the son so when the son dies one can really feel the emotional impact. This is where we first see Cecilia Roth shine in the role of Manuela. We are really able to feel that this is a difficult time in her life and that when she decides to pick up and start her life over we understand. When she gets to Barcelona we are immediately thrust into the underworld and are introduced to Antonia San Juan who does an excellent playing Manuela's old friend a pre-op transvestite. She does come off as being a bit over the top at times, but is never out of character. There is a scene where Agrado was given the opportunity to put on a one women show she seems to drop the ball and a scene with a lot of potential was fairly tame. My biggest problem with the movie is the relationship between Penelope Cruz's character, Rosa, and Manuela. I was confused on how Rosa came to trust Manuela so completely so quickly. I do not think that Cruz did anything special with the character, which was unfortunate because she is such an important part of the story of Manuela. Since this movie is about Manuela as a mother and since she adopts Rosa's baby, when she dies in child birth, it is disappointing that there was not more of a connection between Roth and Cruz on screen. I did love some of the transition shots used and the one at the end with the train going from Barcelona and then back again was neat. These type of shots along with the soundtrack keeps this movie from being too boring and not just a rehashing of the same story. Also I like the almost meta aspect of the theater production of A Streetcar Name Desire. I enjoyed how it was interwoven into the story and how the actress and the story play itself became a part of Manuela's growth. Watching her take care of the principle actresses and Rosa allowed the viewer to never lose track of what made Manuela a mother. Overall this movie was extremely well put together, but there were weaknesses to be had. At times the movie lost focus on Manuela and focused a bit too much on Agrado or Rosa's stories. It was a fresh take on what normally would have been a boring and bland Oscar bait movie.",

Perhaps what is most odd, especially in retrospect, is that all of these elements seem to be omnipresent, much like real life.For its acting, this is a rare gem. I was unfamiliar with all of the cast but found their talents (especially the lead role's played by Cecilia Roth) to be remarkable. SOME SPOILERS - A few unknowns occur early on in the film such as who is Esteban's father and where is he. Also, the car accident as Esteban is trying to get an autograph seems a bit stretched. Later, the irony of who Esteban's father is and Sister Mar\u00eda's baby (played by Penelope Cruz) leads to a shocking discovery. While some of these elements may not have be too plausible, they help to present a film revealing some of the dirty, chaotic, and ultimately senseless aspects of life. In the end, the film feels as if it leaves you with more than just a story. The character Agrado shows, despite any distaste, that drag queens are people too and can have quite a sense of humor to boot. \"All About My Mother\" is a European street-life tale that emerges with a happy ending. 7/10",

It is an operatic story about drug addicts, transsexuals, transvestites, whores, and AIDS, but mostly it is a story about women -- and men who want to be women. Its emotions are so over-the-top that Verdi or Puccini would have had a field day setting it to music.  It is as subtle as a train wreck.  That being said, it is also warm and occasionally moving.  The performances, particularly Cecilia Roth's as Manuela and Antonio San Juan's as Agrado, are terrific.  HBO, to its undying credit, showed it in letter box format on HBO Signature, a big plus.  Recommended, 7 out 10.",

            "content": "Pedro Almovodar's films don't fit neatly into nice square pegs. They take what is unconventional and bizarre and try to make it commonplace.  Films like \"Tie Me Up and Tie Me Down\" and now \"All About My Mother\" are equally adventuresome and frustrating to see because they have that quality of 'you had to have been there' as well as the feeling that something got lost in the translation.  For example, why is there the fascination for Bette Davis, her chain smoking, \"All About Eve\",  the abusive relationship of Stella and Blanche in 'Streetcar Named Desire', and the transforming beauty of men turned into women?  In \"All About My Mother\", a single mother blocks out the memory of her husband from her only son because the circumstances leading to their separation are too painful to discuss.  As coordinator for a Madrid organ transplant center, the film's central character, Manuela,  role plays the survivor of a donor victim for a training program only to reenact the real tragedy later.  Indeed, such revulsion is a recurring theme, from 'Music for Chamelons' by Truman Capote in which the writer and his craft are portrayed in an almost sadomasochistic way, to the manner in which Manuela stalks and confronts the actress Huma about why her son died, to the well-refined mother of a nun who learns her daughter was both impregnated and infected by an HIV positive transvestite, to finally the infant boy and a dead seventeen year old son sired by the same man.  Yet even with barriers to understanding the dialogue and nuances of \"All About My Mother\", the one message that is unmistakably clear about Almovodar's characterizations is their basic humanity - their frailties as well as their strengths and their determination to survive.  \"La Cage Aux Folles\" succeeded in making unconventional lives real and meaningful and \"All About My Mother\" does so just as well.",

The gorgeous cinematography and witty editing are also vital to the film's success - see the great shot where two years pass in a few seconds: a train going one way, and another one coming in the opposite direction.  But in the end I would argue that the film - though enjoyable - fails because it lacks tension and conflict.  Everyone supports everyone else, everyone is so strong and self-sufficient that there is little or no drama. Having only seen one other Almodovar movie (\"Live Flesh\") I feel distinctly unqualified to discuss this in the context of his other work, so I can only discuss it as a film in its own right: It's entertaining and enjoyable but curiously lightweight.  Perhaps that is the intention, to show that films about what most movies would class as sexual \"deviants\" don't have to be heavy and maudlin and \"meaningful\".",

In Spanish w/ English subtitles, it's a very engaging film that contains a typically most interesting collection of Amoldovar characters-- trans-sexual prostitutes, a grand dame theater matron, an actress who's a junkie, and a fallen nun.  It's a very emotional work as well--if you've lost a close friend or relative, you may want to wait a while before seeing this.  I definitely rank this in my top ten list of 1999.  All About My Mother is not for the kids.  I'm sure it won't be playing in smaller cities either, and don't look for it at the multiplex. It's unfortunate that more Americans don't take to movies with subtitles.  Seeing this film will convert a few \"non readers\" to check out foreign language fare.",

The story is a paean to women everywhere, most especially mothers, with the story opening on a tender relationship between Manuela and her son, Esteban.  But tragedy ensues, and Manuela travels to Barcelona to find the first Esteban, her estranged husband who now goes by the name Lola.  The plot is not one which lends itself to description, but the characters are.  Rosa, the pregnant, HIV-positive nun.  Her mother, the art forger who obviously cannot connect with her daughter.  Huma Rojo, the great actress, and her lover, the self-absorbed, self-destructive junkie Nina.  La Agrado, the transsexual who steals the show (and refreshingly does not need to chase acceptance or pity from others).  ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER deftly weaves together love, pain, friendship, death, and birth with Almod\u00f3var's bold, candy-colored visuals. Tragedy has rarely been this enjoyable, and few character films can stir the mind and heart like this - even at twice the length of ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER.

For example, late in the film the main character, Marcella leaves town and returns immediately--the train going one way and then back in the opposite direction (with a voice-over telling us 2 years have lapsed.) The audience giggles en masse, because it's so silly, soap opera-like, and so in keeping with the rest of the story, which is full of tunnels. Very Freudian, those tunnels--always with bright lights and lively scenes of colour at tunnel's end, like most birth canals.You needn't go see this film to be moved, or anything too soul-searching--though it's a very human film, determined to treat every character as an individual.

Manuela is a mother whose son Esteban is an aspiring writer who the utmost admiration for an actress named Huma Rojo. He chases after her for an autograph and gets hit by a car because of it. Manuela herself was an actress in her younger days and unfortunately must relive a scene she has acted in her actual life. She must decide whether or not to donate her newly dead son's organs. Thus beginning Manuela's trip to Barcelona to tell her son's father about this death. On Manuela's trip, Almodovar's gift of creating interesting and unorthodox characters is in its fullest effect. There is Agrado who is a transvestite prostitute. Hermana Rosa (played by Penelope Cruz) is a nun who is impregnated by another transvestite woman. Huma Rojo's theater production of \"A Street Car Named Desire\" is in town and is struggling with her co- star/girlfriend Nina, a coke-addict. Almodovar has a talent for taking individuals that can easily be caricatures and making them into fully fleshed out characters through their circumstances and temperaments. For example when Manuela asks Agrado is her Chanel suit is real, her answer is \"How could I buy a real Chanel with all the hunger in the world?\"While Manuela is the main character, the spirit of the film is with Agrado. There are two scenes in particular where the content of her character is prevalent. The first is her monologue in which she describes herself as real because she fixed herself to look like who she thinks she could be. The other is a scene where a man asks her to perform a sexual act for him and her reaction. She is the most noble and sincere person in the film among overall genuine characters.Almodovar great love of films is apparent in the film, referencing Bette Davis in \"All About Eve\" and \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" which was adapted from a play. In the end, he dedicates the film not only to female actors but mothers as well. In a sense he implies that mothers are actors themselves when it comes to keeping things from they're children.",

The actors help, of course, and they are to a man/ woman/ transvestite magnificent, especially Cecilia Roth as the stricken mother and Antonia San Juan as her transvestite friend.

When you know you have someone's back to lay on when times are tough (and of course, offering your back as well when the other person needs), everything else passes in a easier and smoother manner. People in general are constantly trying to beat each other, to look superior, be more powerful or whatever, so it's hard to find a nice friendship / relationship like this.Not my favorite kind of movie, but still very good.",

I got the feeling the director was celebrating how despite their desire to resist the impulse- women can't help but nurture those in need.  There've been lots of examples I've seen of women who don't \"have a mother/savior bone in\" their bodies. I enjoyed all of their performances, especially the actress portraying Agroda(sp?). She stole everyones scene! Roth and Paredes were great as well. I suppose Penelope Cruz was ok.Spoiler***I just had a problem with her character Sister Rosa. The whole situation with her- I just couldn't buy it. Why would she do that? They played up Lola as a controlling thieving backstabber. What would compell a Nun to do such a thing? If they wanted that part of the story to be a little more believable, they should have emphasized how Lola was attractive to both sexes in her non-binary state. She was kind of like a \"Mango\" from SNL or something. And why would Agroda want to be friends with her?",

OK, forget about the plot, and enjoy the warmth of the movie. Isn't it great to see the best Spanish actors in one cast? Only Almodovar can attract them with his crazy ideas.What comes to the viewers' mind after first minutes of the movie? My answer: red and yellow pattern..The pattern of Almodovar's life, it is not von Trier with his vague colors, it is not Spielberg with his flashy colors. This visual color effect puts viewers into the atmosphere of the film from first seconds.There's lots of intersecting stories in the plot of the movie. We see a fading actress fighting for her love, we see a story of a mother suffering a loss of her son, we see the underworld story of transvestites, a story of drug addicts, the story of dying HIV-victim...Isn't it what is going around us in day-to-day life, but we do not pay attention to it???\nThe master, Almodovar, shows another side of life to us, and his cast is a great support for that. Personally, I discovered to myself that Penelope Cruz is not just another Spanish beauty, but is a very talented actress. This movie was a really good start for her career, just look at how much she is filmed these days in Hollywood.Being a big Almodovar fun, I should say that this movie has overcome my previous favourite of this director: \"Women on the verge of the nervous breakdown\". I highly recommend \"Todo sobre mi madre\" to all people who come to movies to see a piece of art, and not another one-day nonsence with Schwarzenegger. I liked it a lot, and..yes, I even cried, because this movie is so sincere and touching, that you can hardly surpress your emotions.If you decided to see this movie after reading this message, please reply to my mail and tell me if you agree with my opinion.",

The same joy can be found in the light, smart touch used by Pedro Almodovar discovering characters: being always on the sunny side of the street, when \"apparently\" there is nothing but darkness. I think this joy comes from a deep concerning of life, accepted in all its complications, that's another way to say: its gifts.Finally, the mystery. For sure this word is quite abused, but we have to accept the simple fact that life is a mystery and, for this reason, unjudgeable. Pedro doesn't judge: he shows. Better, he drinks wine and poisons in the same cup, testifying that it works.

I did not, however, consider this a larger movie than a couple of good laughs. The story was very profound, every actress either had or did live through some huge sadness, so to speak. The fundamental plot of this movie was very demanding, it must thus be very realistic and justifiable according to human behaviour, when thrown in such emotional crisis. Whereas I found this sadness, this depression, this wandering state the most relevant, the most fundamental object to depict I was really, truly disappointed, even quite upset. There was but one scene where a character actually cried, however, she nearly had the chance to even begin until Almodovar threw us into the next scene. In such emotional state we reveal ourselves, our true selves, only when we are alone. We do not act according to our emotions when looked upon, especially not in such a position. How many times, how long was a character alone? Hardly ever, and if so, for an absurd short moment. What this movie gave me what nothing but laughs, beyond that, nothing of positive or poetic, artistic value what so ever. Almodovar himself is, indeed, glad that the European filmmakers differ from the Hollywood stationed, however, this movie had every awful parallel to simple Hollywood productions trying to explore metaphysics. It's an easy, awful attempt to depict grief and sadness, it's more of an insult to the two states rather than an exploration of them, probably why it became so popular as well. \"Todo sobre mi madre\" surely, by its plot, demand great vision, great talent, however, Almodovar proved to lack both.",

In this movie, there's a couple scene right after another that do the trick.  It's a lovely feeling to cry and feel hope at the same time.  It's tears combined with despair that sucks.",

            "review_title": "Review for Todo sobre mi madre",
            "content": "Like the title says, Pedro Almodovar's movie, Todo sobre mi madre, talks about mothers, but not only the ones you would think of at first. In reality he talks about many kinds of mothers and the roles and relationships that they have with their children, biological or not. The movie, that is presented very well, shows all of the women in their anxiety, sadness and laughter. This would be a good movie to watch with girl friends.The movie is based around Manuela (Cecilia Roth), a single mother that lives in Madrid with her son, Esteban (Eloy Azor\u00edn). For her son's birthday, the two attend A Streetcar Named Desire. After the play Esteban wants the autograph of lead actress, Huma Rojo (Marisa Paredes). He runs after her to try to obtain it and is hit by a car. Esteban is killed, and ironically Manuela, a coordinator of transplants, has to decide if she wants to donate Esteban's organs. Then she travels to Barcelona to look for the father that her son never knew and tell him what has happened. Manuela discovers an old friend, La Agrado (Antonia San Juan), a transvestite prostitute that is trying to change her life, and she also finds new friends in Huma, who she begins to work for, and Rosa (Penelope Cruz), a pregnant nun that works with prostitutes and was also the last person to see her ex-husband. The movie follows the women through the difficult pregnancy of Rosa, the rough relationship of Huma and her lover, Nina, and Manuela's search for Lola, her transvestite ex-husband.The relationships between all of the women unite the movie. With the exception of Esteban, who dies very early, the movie doesn't have a main male character. Some, like La Agrado, were men, and have the physical parts of a man, but they are actually women. Rosa's father, I believe, is the stereotype of men in the movie, lost with his dog and confused about the lives of the women. The movie shows the roles that women play in the lives of everyone. It is obvious that the independence of the women from men is a principle theme, but more important is the fact that they are all the mothers of each other. Manuela is a mother to Esteban, Rosa, and then Rosa's child, but she cares for everyone, including La Agrado when she is hurt. Huma is a mother to Nina although she is her lover. Everyone cares for each other and they make a 'family.' The movie shows all of the different roles that women have to play in their lives, from actress to mother to nurse.I like the cinematography of the movie. Almodovar uses many colors for the costumes, in the scenes, in all aspects of the movie. They helped to establish and develop the personalities. For example, La Agrado is a very unique person and this is shown in her clothes. Also I like that there are many mosaics, like the ones that are all over Barcelona from Antoni Gaudi. An aspect that I do not like a lot is the music. Much of it reminded me of a murder or mystery movie. I didn't think it fit into the movie well. It fit in some scenes, but other scenes I felt it did not. Also there are some interesting camera angles. I like when Lola looks at the photo of Esteban, and they only show his eyes. My favorite was when Esteban was writing in his notebook, and he wrote on the camera. I thought that it was a very inventive camera angle.In general I liked Todo sobre mi madre. I liked the cinematography more, but the plot was good also. The relationships between the characters were very interesting and all of the actors in the movie played their roles very well. Personally the movie is a little predictable. It was easy to predict the deaths of Rosa and Esteban and also the father of Rosa's baby. Although that was the case, the movie is very fun, and I have already recommended it to my friends.",

At times it starts to resemble a caricature - everyone's crying, everyone's dying, everyone's a drug-addict or HIV-positive. It's a nonsense! I mean - if you'll read screenplay (which i did) and will look at this story without all that tragic music you will find that it IS a subject for great parody on soap-operas. Really - it's very-very funny from start to finish, except one scene - the death of principal character's son (I must admit - it's the only scene in the movie where you may find the traces of genius). Look - where else could you see absolutely serious story with hero like this: HIV-positive transvestite (!), adored by beautiful women (!). Almodovar in his prime (when he was one of the greatest European directors) never, i mean - NEVER EVER could tell you such story with such seriousness. NEVER! He would laugh at it! And he could make a great comedy on this subject, but... Where this deadly seriousness came from? One may say that Almodovar becomes mature, but i think he just lost his balls. In fact - \"Kika\" was his last true \"Almodovarian\" picture (if you receive my meaning). \"Carne Tremula\" was a disastrous attempt, proved that he has nothing to say. The only picture, where he could find a balance between seriousness and farce was \"La Flor de mi Secreto\" - a really sad and heartfelt picture, unexpected thing for Almodovar fans. And it's a very characteristic of our two-faced society that this weepy rubbish was so high-praised. When Almodovar did really great and really mad and really funny, politically incorrect pictures - he was a kind of outcast in cinema society. And at that time he didn't care about honors and prizes, he just wanted to make unusual and crazy pictures. And now - when he ultimately lost his talent - he becomes a hero of the year! Wow! Oscar, Cannes etc. etc. It's really awful. The King is dead - Long live the king.",

            "content": "All About My Mother is one movie that I would not watch if I was given a choice(had to watch it for an assignment). Personally, I felt that this movie lack character development as all of the characters, save Agrado. The way they are developed makes it hard for me to relate to them. They somewhat appear aloof, save Agrado, who brings this dull plot to life. At the end of the movie, I am somewhat disappointed as the movie fail to make an impact on issues such as sexuality and religion are brought fourth. Almod\u00f3var basically touches the surface of the iceberg and I felt that this was a pity as he could have explored these issues deeper. The storyline too, bored me as I felt the movie somewhat senseless with no purpose. I fail to comprehend the message that Almod\u00f3var is trying to convey.However, to be fair, I felt the use of colors in this movie, artistically and brilliantly done. The vibrant hews of red and yellow to me represents the emotions of Manuela. We see passion, love and anger in the color red, which represent Manuela's emotions for Lola, her son, her hurt and her anger. Where else, the color yellow represents the other side of her (her caring and motherly nature) and this can be seen when she forge a warm relationship with Rosa, who is carrying her husband's child. In the beginning we see lots of greens and blues that I think portrays Manuela's security and calmness, which she finds in her son. At the beginning she is reluctant to mention to Estaban of his father but when he dies she goes on a hunt for Lola. When this happens, her sense of security, which is represented by blue and green, diminishes. Her emotions change and we see this by frames mainly dominated by the color red and yellow.One interesting factor to note is that we see glimpses of the play \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" throughout the movie. I feel that this play is crucially connected to the movie, as it is central to the film. It not only begins the film but it also brings together the characters of this story. The reason that Manuela goes in search for Lola is because of the death of her son, which is linked to this play. Almod\u00f3var does a brilliant job in showing us Estaban's point of view, as an oncoming car knocks him down. The way the camera pans and moves gives me a sense of realism as Estaban is wretchedly mowed down. This is one scene of the movie that I really loved as the camera work was rather unique. Also, Almod\u00f3var has a rather twisted sense of humor, and this can be seen when he shows Estaban nearly getting knocked down while crossing the street to meet his mother for the show \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". What is ironic is that he does get knocked down \u0096 but after the show, while chasing for Huma's autograph. I find all of this rather senseless and it leads me to feel that life is so short and precious \u0096 treasure the moments you have, as it may be your last. In this, I feel that the director does a good job in portraying life and how it can just change within a split second.Overall, All About My Mother is a film that I felt could have made more of a statement. It is my view that many issues in the movie was left hanging and although maybe the director did this to let the viewers decide on them, the impact would have been more if he made some kind of statement. I just wish the plot was more realistic as I felt it was a tad unbelievable. Overall, it is not a movie I would recommend to anyone unless they are fans of Almod\u00f3var.",
