The direction is very evenly paced with no sags in the middle, but without the constant sensory overload that seems to be the Hollywood norm in this genre.The story reminded me of the \"The Sting\" in subject matter and quality.  The movie keeps you guessing as to who will end up with the money and how they will get to it.I highly recommend this movie.",

            "content": "This film by the very talented Fabian Bielinsky, has been compared, at least in the United States, with films directed by David Mamet, who a lot consider a master in this genre. I dare anyone to take a second look at those films and compare them to 9 Queens. They all pale in comparison! In fact, Mr. Mamet can take lessons from Mr. Bielinsky in how he accomplished writing and directing with a very tight budget and still given us a film that looks a lot more expensive than what it really must have cost.Suffice it to say that 9 Queens is a joy to look at. The story of a con artist and his apprentice is executed with great flair and panache. The Buenos Aires of today looks even better as seen by Mr. Bielinsky behind his camera. The three principals, Richardo Darin, Gaston Pauls and Leticia Bredice shine in this story of deception where what we see is not necessarily what's behind the real plot of the story. Ricardo Darin, who was excellent in The Son of the Bride, outdoes himself portraying his street smart thief. Gaston Pauls is very credible behind the facade of the trusting learner of the trade that Mr Darin is willing to teach him. This film was a surprise because it is very well paced and it keeps the viewer going in one direction and presenting us an ending that is both credible and possible. Let's hope for more films from Fabian Bielinsky in the not too distant future.",

It certainly has the requisite number of twists and turns to please any fan of the genre. At the end, the 114 minutes had passed like a breeze, and that's one of the sure signs of a good movie.

            "content": "Wonderful little movie about two small time con-men, Marcos & Juan, in Buenos Aires who come upon a scheme involving \"The Nine Queens\". A set of rare stamps from the long defunct German Weimar Republic that are worth a kings ransom. We then soon get to see the ups and downs by the two in the movie to first obtain them and then fence them. Marcos' sister Anibal who works as a manager in a large hotel in Buenos Aires call her brother to help an old friend of his, Sandler, who collapsed in the lobby and to take him home.Arriving at the hotel with his friend Juan, Marcos finds old man Sandler is not only very sick but also excited about a guest staying at the hotel. Sandler also recognized Juan as the son of a person that he worked with years ago in forging money documents and stamps. Sandler tells the two con men that there's a guest in the hotel who is being deported to Venezuela within the next few days who's the multi-millionaire industrialist Vidal Gandolfo who also collect stamps for a hobby.Sandler goes on to tell the two con-men that he can counterfeit the famous \"Nine Queens\" stamps and sell them to Gandolfo and they all can split the take, which runs as high as half a million dollars. The three become involve with the scheme to first fool and then fleece Gandolfo of the money he'll be willing to pay for the stamps. What they didn't realize was just how many other persons will become involve with their plan that in the end will lead to one of the most surprising endings you'll ever see in a crime caper film. Ingenious story with a WOW ending that will keep you guessing all through the movie and won't let you down in the end. A very south, Argentina, of the border version of \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" film about greed and deception and what it does to people effected by it. Fine acting and direction with a top flight story makes \"The Nine Queens\" one of the best of it's kind. The movie is so good that it's really hard to write too much about it in fear of spoiling it for those who haven't seen it. All I can say is stay with it until the final credits are rolling up the screen and don't let it's slow pace for the first 45 or so minutes or so make you turn it off the movie more then makes up for it in the end.",

            "review_title": "The mirror of deception",
            "content": "`Nueve reinas' or `Nine Queens,'a film made in Argentina on a shoestring, is one of the most elaborate and authentic grifter/con films ever made, and I don't know if I could explain it if I wanted to.  In fact to explain it would be to ruin it for anyone who hasn't already seen it, because each successive grift is a surprise, and it's only after one has seen it that one wants very much to discuss just what it is that happened all through and above all what that final sequence means.  It is the gift of `Nine Queens' to pile surprise on surprise on surprise until it seems that the grifters are the victims of their own grift at every stage of the long fascinating game.  This is not a parable about cons but a literal con.  It's the real thing.  Stories about grifters or con artists, like, say, the excellent Stephen Frears movie, `The Grifters,' (1990), or the ingenious David Mamet movie,  `The Spanish Prisoner' (1997). or Fred Schepisi's illuminating `Six Degrees of Separation' (1993), have some point to make, but the only point of a real con is that the con artist can never be trusted and his victims can always be fooled, and it's the essence of dealing with such people that you realize at some point that nothing they said was reliable, from the very first word. This is the way it is with `Nine Queens,' and that's what makes it such a classic movie and such an ultimate depiction of the world of the grifter. And so the movie becomes a kind of parable after all, because as Calder\u00f3n said, Life is a dream and a dream of a dream, and as I would like to point out for those who I hope will not find it too obvious, a filmmaker is a con artist too, because he sets out to make us believe that what he depicts is real, which it is not, and that his actors are the people they portray, which they are not.  And so a con artist is a perfect role for an actor to play.Perhaps Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky, the creator of `Nine Queens,' who's less famous than Mamet and Frears and Schepisi, is therefore more modest, and is therefore able to focus on the con within the con without making any point besides conning us through to the end of this ingenious story.  The actors are not famous, but like any actors worth their salt they are convincing and charismatic enough to hold our attention and make us believe that they are doing what they say they are.  The very simplicity of the production and modesty of the actors (not of their skills, which are excellent, but of their reputations, which are minor) aid in convincing us of the audience that the scenes we are watching are or could be quite real. The story begins when a younger man who has been conning the staff of a convenience store gets caught in his con, and an older man comes in successfully posing as a policeman and takes him away, thus freeing him from the clutches of the store manager and staff.  Thus two con artists, Juan, the younger man, and Marcos, the older one, meet and form an alliance, in which Marcos enlists Juan's help in a scheme he has yet to explain.At one point early on Marcos makes a phone call when Juan is out of earshot and he says only, `It's on.'  What?  Do we ever find out?  What is clear from that moment, if not before, is that no alliance between con artists is a sharing of trust.The ultimate lesson to be learned from `Nine Queens' is that no one is more gullible than a con man \u0096 that grifters, in order to con people, have to be able to believe in their own fabrications, and thereby they become potential victims of the grift. Eventually the two deceivers are led to a set of stamps of great value called `The Nine Queens,' which they set out to sell to a very rich man visiting from Spain called Gandolfo.  Gandolfo seems almost ridiculously eager to purchase these items from these fellows who have no pedigree or legitimate provenance.  But herein lies another truth, that greed \u0096 in this case the rich collector's greed to obtain a prize item by any means necessary \u0096 will lead men to take unreasonable risks.  Everyone once a con is afoot is eager to make a profit, and both con artist and victim want to believe they have found a wonder at a bargain price.It is essential to the value of the movie that we in the audience realize only at the end that the con is on us.  No story is more focused than this one.  Like a picaresque tale it moves from moment to moment: each moment is a transformation, and must be watched with riveted attention because it will change what comes next.  Such a simple and effective means of constructing a movie!  Yet how rarely are such means put to such good use!  `Nine Queens' has etched a small but permanent niche for itself in the history of cinema.This is a mean and ugly world, which at the same time is utterly fascinating and compulsively watchable.  Can people really be like this?  Indeed they can.  And the interest with which we watch it all happen shows that we are made of the same cloth.",

Then Juan tries to lure the cashier on the next shift but he is caught by the manager. Marcos claims to be a police officer and arrests Juan; he also brings the money claiming to be evidence. Sooner Juan learns that Marcos is actually an experienced con artist and he invites Juan to be his partner in a scheme.They head to a five-star hotel where Marcos meets his estranged sister Valeria (Leticia Br\u00e9dice) in the reception. She tells that Marco's friend Sandler (Oscar Nu\u00f1ez ) is very ill and wants to talk to him in the locker room. Sandler explains that he had forged a sheet of the valuable stamps Nueve Reinas using a picture he took from the collection that belongs to his sister. He also tells that the Spaniard Vidal Gandolfo (Ignasi Abadal) that is lodged in the hotel is a collector of stamps and will travel on the next morning. Therefore, the stamps should be negotiated on that day. Marcos distributes percentages to a network of swindlers to work with him but there are too many con artists in action luring each other.\"Nueve Reinas\" is one of the most entertaining Argentinean film that I have ever seen and the film that introduced the great actor Ricardo Dar\u00edn to the Brazilian audiences. I saw this film for the first time many years ago and today I have just seen it again with my family and friends.The story seems to be inspired in \"The Sting\" (1973) or \"The Spanish Prisoner\" (1997), with sophisticated entwined schemes where the viewer never knows who is conning whom. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Nove Rainhas\" (\"Nine Queens\")",

            "review_title": "Fantastic Film! Don't be afraid of the subtitles!",
            "content": "I know some people out there who don't like to watch movies with subtitles. It either makes them feel that they are missing out on the essence of the film because they do not understand the language being spoken, or they simply don't want to be forced to read in order understand what's going on. For those who share that opinion, it's quite a shame because this is one fantastic film that you will be missing. Being the son of an Argentine-born parent, I more or less understand a lot of the Spanish spoken by the characters in this film, though I am in no way fluent. As you watch this film though, you almost forget that the subtitles are there. You can miss a few lines of dialog and still have a good grasp of exactly what's going on. This is due mainly to the two starring actors in the film who were absolutely incredible. First, Ricardo Darin, is nothing short of brilliant. He's a well-known actor in Argentina and has such an incredibly natural on-screen presence that you can't help but be captivated by his performance. He plays the role of a professional con-man to perfection, combining his dramatic and comedic skills to form an equally villainous as well as sympathetic character. Secondly, his counterpart Gaston Pauls is equally brilliant as Darin's baby-faced accomplice in what is to be a \"one in a million\" opportunity to swindle a wealthy businessman out of a small fortune. I've seen the American version \"Criminal\" - 2004, which is also good, but does not really do justice to the original. Nine Queens is a brilliant piece of international film-making that will not disappoint any fan of the genre. As mentioned by a reviewer, there is absolutely zero \"down time\" in this film. The dialog is crisp, the characters are very well cast and there is no time wasted with any unnecessary filler or elongated scenes. Every word and every scene builds a bridge to the next and culminates with a surprising and satisfying ending that you definitely will not be expecting. Please, don't let the language barrier prevent you from seeing this film. It's very easy to follow and well worth the small effort required. 10/10.",

            "content": "I have never seen a film as relentlessly uncompromising about the allure, power, and banality of the con game as I have seen in the Argentine `Nine Queens.' From the opening sequence where small-time grifter Juan pulls a $20 switch at a convenience store to the final scam that looks like `House of Cards' and `The Sting' welded onto `Hard Eight,' nothing is as it seems and no one can be trusted. More recently think of  `Sexy Beast,' `The Heist,' and `The Score.' However this is David Mamet territory, where buddies keep one eye on the target and the other on the buddy. In the current `Enron' environment, no surprise at the allegorical suggestion of this film that trust is a rare commodity these days, banks are vulnerable (consider the Argentinean economy), and lame goddess Nemesis may never catch up with some of business's most egregious con artists, from CEO's to salespeople. The film's pace is quick, like the hands of 3-card Monte; emotional involvement either on the screen or in the audience is minimal; everyone has a moment of triumph and defeat. Even beauty has its deceptive moment when Leticia Bredice, as the sister of other con artist Ricardo Darin, struts her stuff in the hotel lobby. `Nine Queens' won 7 awards from the Argentinean Film Critics Association. I'm betting that's not a con.",

The director has obviously focused strongly on story telling and not tried any gimmicks. I found this movie during some random surfing and it was pretty fun to watch.

Thankfully there is always some innocent involved who reminds us that the world isn't completely cynical. In Nine Queens, however, the atmosphere of deceit is so complete that everyone is either running a scam, or expecting one.This Argentinian film will never be featured to promote tourism in Buenos Aires. An artificial economic bubble full of overvalued pesos in Argentinia means hard financial times. Hard times breeds desperation and cunning. The Buenos Aires of Nine Queens is teeming with thieves among whom there is no honour. This film will appeal to the cynic in all of us. Sometimes the safest approach to people is to expect the worst from them.Ricardo Darin's performance as 'Marcos' is as perfect and intricate as the swiss made time-pieces he probably swipes.

They hope to sell The Nine Queens, extremely rare stamps, to a wealthy collector. The stamps are forgeries done by a very ill friend of Marcos, and if they are able to complete the transaction as the collector is about to leave town, he will not have time to go to a laboratory and discover the stamps are fake. The fakes are good enough to pass any other muster.This is a marvelous film, made with a modest budget, that is entertaining, imaginative, and very clever. It's along the lines of House of Games and The Spanish Prisoner, both written by David Mamet, who seems to have cornered the market on this kind of plot. The story here is more straightforward, more streetwise, and grittier than anything of Mamet's. Also, as good as Mamet's work in this area is, there's always a little staginess that makes one wary of a setup. There's none of that here.Highly recommended - you won't mind the subtitles.",

No one character, or actor for that matter, overtakes any of the others. I don't think you'll get this consistency, unless Mamet directs. The downtown realism of Buenos Aires only adds to the story. It's not a shoot location we're used to seeing, and the novel setting creates an odd contrast to what we've seen come out of modern Europe.

In fact, there have been so many such movies that at first 'Nine Queens', Fabien Bielinsky's effort in this genre, feels uncomfortable to watch, as it seems likely we are going to get a fairly standard assembly of trick-upon-trick: more than once it explicitly acknowledges Mamet's 'House of Games'. But the film soon starts to redeem itself, when it becomes clear that the characters are also aware of the long con, and are all mutually suspicious of each other's intentions; the question is, who is playing the biggest trick? The real reason this works, with a plot arguably less intricate than Mamet's finest, is the great performances from the lead actors, Ricardo Darin, and Gaston Pauls; the two mean they play are very different, and Darin's character is logically (although not in fact) unlikeable; together, they give the movie an odd-couple charm, which spreads far enough that, after spending the whole film looking for the final trap, the audience is nonetheless distracted and fails to spot it in advance. At least, in my case, I foresaw everything other than the most important detail; which is the sign of a con-trick film that got it right. The death of Bielinsky, whose second (and final) film ('El Aura', starring Darin in a very different role) was also superb, was a sad loss for cinema.",

But he has a great partner to play off with. But as I said before, the script is the main star, with great dialog and a story worthy to see. There is so much tension and so many things happening, you will enjoy this. Just don't think about it as real life. This is a movie and of course a few things that happen there, could not really happen or that too many things are coincidences. This would spoil the fun you could have with this movie!",

Sometimes you visit a movie without exp actions, even after reading a summary you don't expect a lot. Buy hey you are on holiday, it's a beautiful summer night so what does it matter. So with low expectations, laying down on the ground in the sand in a not so comfortable position, i was really surprised by the fantastic twists in this Argentinian movie who gave me a trip on a very surprising roller-coaster. Only after the movie, when I stood up, i felt that i had been laying down very uncomfortable in the sand and had problems getting up. Sometimes a movie is so energetic and thrilling that you forget everything around you. A great movie, 10 on 10",

In addition to this I have to say that the direction of Fabian Bielinsky was really good and this is something that we can understand in the whole duration of the film. About the interpretations of this movie I have to mention the very good interpretation of Ricardo Dar\u00edn who was for one more time outstanding in his role and the interpretations of Gast\u00f3n Pauls and Leticia Br\u00e9dice who were equally good.Lastly I want to say that \"Nine Queens\" is a really different movie than the other Crime - Thriller movies because it combines very good the plot which is perfectly written with the cast. Also I have to say that this movie remind me the movie \"The Game\" with Michael Douglas which I believe has many common things and one of those is that you can not expect anything and you can not believe anyone.",

The ending shows an ambiguity not usually present in the genre, at least if you compare it to the US versions of this genre. If you compare it with Matchstick Man or The Grifters, and the sanitized Hollywood versions, The sting: all of them seem to take a clear moral view of the characters, one way or another. I can't quite remember House of Games, but I do believe in all of them we are in a world apart and individuals make a choice between a \"moral\" way of living and one in which the \"con game\" rules. I don't think this is the case for Nueve Reinas, the ending does not give you a clear guideline for judging the characters, you have to make your own interpretation. On the one hand Marcos is not at all likable and becomes the fooler fooled. But Juan, who we are happy to learn, fools him, I'm not sure is any less of a fooler, just a more \"natural talent.\" That ambiguity in the ending I don't think is completely apparent to all. The fact that Juan gives his, in the end we find out, girl-friend the ring he stole with Marcos, from an old lady and a ring that was a family memento ... a minor detail maybe, but a cruel act typical of the \"con\" artist who takes advantaged of an old lady's solitude (not a pretty picture). And are we sure that he does this for his dad, or is that just a \"con\" the picture create ... and is the girl friend just out to swindle the brother. In the end Juan, the guy with the honest face, has learned all to well how to \"survive\", and I wonder if in the end that is not what we are looking at in this movie. The ending does not give you all the answers, and maybe that is what makes this such an interesting movie and one that can be seen more than once",

Nine Queens is written and directed by Fabian Bielinsky and stars Gast\u00f3n Pauls as Juan, a small time crook who meets veteran crook Marcos, played brilliantly by Ricardo Dar\u00edn, when trying to scam a gas station attendant out of change for a small purchase.  When Marcos pretends to be a police officer and takes Juan out of the station with the money in hand, a friendship is then created as the two scam artists put their own unique skills towards larger fare.  Juan seems naive and skeptical at first under the guidance of the veteran Marcos, but soon, both are running the streets of Argentina scamming everyone from old ladies out of money for a nephew that never visits, to restaurant waiters who are duped out of change for money that was never received.  The main story surrounds a scam about priceless flawed stamps known as the 'Nine Queens' that the two try and sell to a collector.  Many obstacles are put in the characters way en route to the score, and these situations keep the story moving at a lightening pace.  As time goes on, Juan develops as a character with a conscious who does not feel at ease in the targets picked by his counterpart.  Meanwhile, Marcos develops into a dark, mean character who even double crosses his old partners and even pimps his own sister for the purpose of a big score. Surprisingly, as repulsive as this action may imply, we never dislike any of the characters in the film, and thus we are thrown into a story where trying to determine who indeed is the mastermind behind the scams is always in doubt.  Maybe the most surprising is how easy the scams are for the two partners. In a world everyone seems to be working on a scam yet no one claims not to be a crook, we see two characters pulling small heists on the average community with an ease and confidence that could easily represent our very own lives or experiences.  There are many subplots in Nine Queens.  There are actually so many subplots that you may get lost if your attention is diverted.  A dispute within Marcos' family regarding an inheritance, Juan's father in jail needing $70,000, and old partners once scammed by Marcos coming back to assist in the overall heist.  However, each subplot comes full cirlce and each player shows their true colors by the closing credits.Beautifully photographed, the film takes the viewer on a rollercoaster ride where no one can be trusted and everything is a means to the eventual end. It was the directing debut of Fabian Bielinsky and he handles the pace with incredible percision and a flare for what is known as Mametisms. \nKudos to all those involved with Nine Queens.  American film makers could take a page from this film.",

Fabi\u00e0n Bielinsky, the director and the script-writer, delivers us a psychological insight into the birth of corruption and its bitter fruits so you see what happens if a nation cannot stand against its criminals, who claim that they are not...crooks. Everybody is sheeting everybody in this movie but nobody accepts to be identified as a criminal.  Bielinsky started as a first-assistant director of documentaries as \"Republica perdida (1985)\" about the Argentinian dictatorship or a Science-Fiction movie as \"La Sonambula (1998)\"; he then used an actor Gaston Pauls (Juan) who is the key-figure as an experienced crook in this movie. The movie keeps its surprising rhythm until just before the end. The very end of the story is somewhat strange and has not the label \"top-quality\"  of the start and of the development.  After all, this movie proofs that a good thriller can be written and executed by an experienced cinematograph if the intention to catch the audience by an intelligent plot is held continuously.  Some sub-plots are difficult to understand but they do never brake the rapidity of the social exchanges, dialogues, interventions (f.i.: the father of Marco (Ricardo Darin) in prison).

Although this movie seems to have a lot of US independant filmography characteristics, it has an obvious Argentinian touch that make it a top movie.I don\u00b4t agree with TomyGrau opinion. I think that Argentina cinematography is excellent, for an obvious reason, when you have a low budget to make a movie (with few efforts from the state, not knowing if it will be released in theatres, or will ever see the money invested again) you have to make something different and original to succed. They do not copy classics.\nLots of Argentina movies were original and they succed. Examples in the last 5 years, \"Pizza Birra Faso\", \"Mundo Grua\" or \"9 Reinas\", None of them have a message.

That's where the viewer/reader and the narrator/writer are made equal and are pitted against each other. It is a mental contest to see who clarifies the story first, and is a contest with very specific rules.Film is more visceral than the written word but less engaging in terms of the imagination, and many viewers don't like to work. So an offshoot of the mystery is the con film. In this case, we expect the film to surprise us. The rules are less rigid: it has to make sense at the end, but we don't need explicit clues. We do expect a narrative upset at the end. In the best of these, we are drawn into a story that we invest in -- the more sense it makes, the greater the upset.This scam is a larger twist than normal, but is is really easy to anticipate because of how the story unfolds. The setup is so elaborate, and the characters so cartoonishly extreme that we know from the first scene who the real artist is. Otherwise, there wouldn't be a film.Part of the game in the con setup is the language along the way. Its a trick of Shakespeare's that Mamet has embraced. The more engaging the language and related metaphors, the more investment we have in what is overturned. It is the only reason Mamet uses the form I believe -- it is the best way to leverage his skill. The language here could be particularly spellbinding in Spanish, but certainly not in the English subtitles.The title (and hence the maguffen) derives from a basic card scam, not explained here.Near the beginning is some masterful editing, showing a deep fabric of crookedness when the same is described.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.",

            "content": "Nine Queens is a tricky little film, a film so in love with the notion of tricks and heists and cons that it revolves most of its first hour or so around extended shots of two people walking, talking and engaging in heists and cons. Before you know it, you're being set up for the much bigger picture \u2013 which is one massive theft of some stamps that evolves into a con itself. Yes, it's complicated but its the nature of the game and of the life the people within the film live. Nine Queens lures you in, like a con artist would. It lures you in and dares you to try and keep up with these rather shady but relatively smart and good-looking leads as they talk the talk and walk the walk in and about their chosen lifestyle. You don't want to fall behind and you don't want to feel as if you're being conned in the process.Such is the manner of Nine Queens, a film I sought out after watching director Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky's quite excellent 2005, but unreleased in Britain, film entitled 'The Aura' which itself was a heist film of sorts but incorporated many other aspects of a theoretical and film-making nature. Nine Queens carries a distinct style and its twisting, intriguing narrative keeps on bending and twirling whilst providing necessary substance. This is more about introducing characters as archetype thieves to the degree the writer/director deems fit and then allowing the film's plot, twists 'n' all, to just take over and force the fleshing out to occur if and when necessary.The thinking required for the film is kicked off in the opening scene. Juan (Pauls), a young and 'upcoming' con artist, tries to covertly rob an all night store in the same cheeky manner he has already done. The staff notice and he's in trouble but for Ricardo Dar\u00edn's character Marcos, who poses as a police man and escorts poor Juan to safety. Juan realises that Marcos isn't a cop once they're out and gone and they exchange words. Turns out Marcos is a con artist as well and they banter. But did Juan get caught on purpose or is he just an inexperienced kid? Did Marcos step in because he needs a fall guy, or because he pitied the man? Who's acting? Who isn't? Who's playing who and who knows more than the other? The mind games in the exchanges have only just begun.Initially, I think the film is so bold as to actually play out in real time. The scenes of Juan and Marcos scouring the streets in search of potential cons, as Marcos adopts the teacher role in showing pupil Juan the tricks of the trade, are fascinating. Initially, the symbolism of each other's respective 'role' lies in their clothes. Juan's casual, young and therefore inexperienced 'role' is suggested through his casual jacket and jeans but is it just acting as a distraction? On the other hand, Marcos' suit and very formal get up suggests the term 'organised criminal', someone who takes pride in their dress sense and (albeit illegal) work. Someone rich with experience and with a certain guile \u2013 it suggests Marcos is perhaps smarter.But is Bielinsky leading us down a path with this visual representation and pretty basic student/pupil set up? The bolt from the blue is the bombshell Marcos drops on Juan to do with the thieving of some priceless stamps, from whence the title of the film is born, due to be passed onto a Spanish buyer in the next few days. This is further developed when it is revealed Marcos' sister, Valeria (Br\u00e9dice), works at the hotel the deal is supposed to occur in and doubles up as someone Juan seems to have his eye on from the beginning. Again, what does it all mean? Who knows more than the other? What's the con that's going on? With Juan needing a certain amount of money to aid in his arrested father's pledge for freedom, a sum close to half a million all of a sudden looks like quite a payday.But the film is more than a few cheery scenes of inventive cons and tricks. The film pauses for its characters to question themselves, raising issues of identity within this criminal circuit. While it doesn't glamorise theft or criminal activity, Marcos tells Juan of the misconception behind what it is they do. There is a consistent referring to how crooks are different to thieves, something that walks along the lines of theft and masterminding a con being an art-form in which it takes a certain amount of skill and acting in pulling off that sort of robbery. I believe this to be comparable to a 'crook' mentality, in which charging in with guns blazing and getting away with money whilst leaving a room of corpses is the alternative. Marcos argues that being a thief is not the same as being a crook and that there are other terms for thieves whereas a criminal is just a criminal.As the narrative draws to a close and certain revelations took place, I was amazed at how my own emotions had been twisted and manipulated. What at first seemed like bizarre coincidences or acts of basic stupidity perhaps propelled by a bad script were, in fact, planned actions designed to lull both us and certain characters in. There is a punch to Nine Queens, a gritty realism and a definite 'look' delivered on top of a neat little narrative that I think works really well. It even inspired the Americans to remake it in 2004.",

Bielinsky DOES nothing with the colours, and rightly so; this doesn't hurt the film, and may well help it - but no colour at all was clearly the way to go; the material begs for such treatment.It's one of those films where it's all in the script (apart from the three understated but exactly right central performances by Gast\u00f3n Pauls, Ricardo Dar\u00edn and Leticia Br\u00e9dice), and the script is crafted with meticulous care. The twists and surprises are all of the delightful kind that make more, not less sense of the preceding material (all of the night I saw the film, and most of the next morning, I was recalling details and saying \"Ah! of course\"), and so they're fun to be sprung by even if they don't surprise us (although only one of them failed to surprise me). If Bielinsky had simply ended...And remember, I warned you about spoilers...If Bielinsky had simply ended with the shot of Juan walking away from Marcos as the latter wore a look of utter dismay and exhaustion on seeing the bank crash, that would have been a brilliant ending - one of the best. Yet he kept the camera running and found a better one. BOTH endings, considered all by themselves, will bear examination afterwards. How's that for a coup?We're told, and what's more we SENSE, that the streets are full of people all attempting to extract they all need out of one another, living by the motto \"Do others, for they would do you\", and that this desperate NEED to swindle pervades the entire society (which is why the bank crash was such a perfect touch, and incidentally, the only thing I actually saw coming). It may be no accident that the film was made in Argentina, a country that has been swindled on a grand scale by the World Bank, a country that has been forced into an economic system based on the art of swindling which more powerful countries are at least free to abandon if they choose.

Marcos, the older of the two men, attempts to open Juan's eyes to the scams that are going on everywhere around them in the streets of Buenos Aires, where every thief claims not to be a thief. He sees Juan as being naive because the younger man expresses some sympathy for his victims and puts limits on what he will take from them. Marcos has no such remorse. He thinks of having a conscience as ridiculous and a hindrance to his trade.The action suddenly becomes more intense when a former partner of Marcos introduces the pair to the scam of a lifetime. The man has counterfeited a sheet of nine rare stamps, worth hundreds of thousands if genuine. He plans to sell the stamps each of which display the image of a woman in profile, the nine queens, to a billionaire stamp collector. Unable to carry out the sale himself, the forger enlists Marcos' help in selling the stamps. Things quickly devolve into a series of struggles over who will get what percentage of the take as everyone who becomes involved uses their skills to overcome the obstacles to the sale, leaving the viewer uncertain about who is the hustler and who is being hustled.The story is fast-paced and well-acted. Dialogue is in Spanish with English and French subtitles.",

It can be a little dry but bolstered by some grand performances, sharp set pieces and I think some sincere social commentary - it's certainly worth a watch. There's also a melancholy behind the joyful credits when you discover the director died very suddenly and quite young - bravely turning down the opportunity to remake the film for American audiences. It now sits in a pantheon of well-loved Argentinian films that were recommended enthusiastically to me by someone from the country. It's the charismatic Ricardo Dar\u00edn that serves as the throughline, and often the emotional anchor of all of these films and here as the morally grey Marcos, he's especially good.",

Ricardo Dar\u00edn's superb performance got him to Spanish's halls of fame (indeed after the success of 9 Reinas, they showed in the Spanish's cinemas some of his previous works, such as \"El Mismo Amor, La Misma Lluvia\"). A great script perfectly cobbled together so you may get to the ending with a big \"no shhhh...!!!\" look on your face. Fun, traps, intelligent dialogs...100% Recommended.*My rate: 8/10",

When a play goes wrong he is rescued by the more experienced Marcos, played by Ricardo Dar\u00edn. They team up for the day, quickly forming a mentor/mentee relationship. Things escalate when the Nine Queens, a rare set of defective stamps from the Weimar Republic, falls into their hands.Nine Queens demands that you pay attention and leaves you asking questions afterwards. As soon as the credits roll, you will find yourself playing the movie back in your head. There is not a wasted moment in this film, a masterclass in economy and pace. The documentary touch in the direction, hand-held and close-ups predominating, adds to the grit. It is tense throughout, but when Marcos' sister Valeria (Leticia Br\u00e9dice) is introduced, there are moments where you dare not breathe.Wonderfully observed, superbly executed, Nine Queens sustains and entertains from start to finish.",

Any society in which everyone believes that everyone else is on the make or on the take and that only a sucker plays it straight, leads a very precarious existence. When mutual distrust and suspicion are so pervasive and it's assumed that there's a crooked angle to everything (even the music, the tango, is redolent of this), a society lacks the minimum of solidarity to undertake and execute collective projects, which are the basis of social order and stability. A social order can survive on this basis if circumstances have allowed its economy to prosper (Argentina in the 20s & 30s, Italy today). But when hard times come, it's the Hobbesian nightmare of a war of all against all (which is nothing other than capitalist competition with the gloves off). The ending to this film (which suggests a kind of dreamed-of solidarity among Argentines) cannot overcome the feeling of pessimism it leaves you with for the future of Argentine society.",

Really, it's a movie that deserves to be seen by more but most people have most likely never even heard about this movie, since it's an Argentinian production. This shall probably also scare a whole bunch of people off already but honestly, Latin American productions are often perfectly watchable ones and besides made in pretty much the same style as Hollywood productions. In other words; perfectly accessible to watch, even for those who aren't really accustomed to watching 'foreign' movies.It luckily was a movie that earned lots of critical praise and got recognized by still many, all over the world, as a great movie. It makes at all the more a big shame that director Fabi\u00e1n Bielinsky died a couple of years after this movie, at a fairly young age. I'm convinced that this guy could had made many more great movies, like this one.Foremost reason why this movie works out well is because it's being a fun movie to watch. Not necessarily in a comedy way but more due to the way the story progresses and how the main characters slowly but steadily get into more and more trouble, as they try to make a big score. It often gets them in some unexpected situations and ensures that the movie makes plenty of twists and turns with its story.It's a simple movie with its setup but one that gets made slightly more complicated with developments. Not that the movie ever gets hard to follow though. Saying that it's often being clever does not mean that it's also totally going overboard with anything and the story becomes too hard or complex to follow.It has some solid characters in it as well and the movie gets mostly carried by its two main leads, played by Ricardo Dar\u00edn and Gast\u00f3n Pauls. All around the movie features some good performances in it, which was also necessary, since it's actually a very talkative movie as well, once you start thinking back about it. Don't let this scare you off though, since the movie is still fast paced as well and features plenty of great developments and situations in it, that will keep you interested at all times.A movie that deserves to be seen by more!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",

Basically, in Buenos Aires, at a convenience store early in the morning, con artist Juan (Gast\u00f3n Pauls) successfully scams the cashier. Marcos (Ricardo Dar\u00edn) observes him attempting the same scam again, he steps in pretending to be a police officer and takes Juan away. When they are far enough, Marcos reveals Juan he is a fellow con man himself. Juan asks Marcos to show him the ropes, because his father, also a con man, is in jail and he wants to raise money fast to bribe a judge to reduce his father's sentence from 10 years to 6 months. Then a scheme seems to fall into their laps: Sandler (Oscar Nu\u00f1ez), a former business associate of Marcos, needs help to sell counterfeit copies of some rare stamps called \"The Nine Queens\". Vidal Gandolfo (Ignasi Abadal) is a rich Spaniard facing deportation and desperate to smuggle his wealth out of the country. Gandolfo has no time to fully check if the stamps are authentic but hired expert (Leo Dyzen) checks and is satisfied. He offers $450,000 for the stamps, but he knows they are forged, and demands a cut from Juan and Marcos. The fake stamps are then stolen out of the cons' hands by thieves on motorcycles who, unaware of their value, toss them into a river. To salvage the scheme, Marcos approaches Sandler's widowed sister Berta (Elsa Berenguer), the owner of the real stamps, who agrees to sell them for $250,000. Marcos is able put up $200,000 and asks Juan to put in the remaining $50,000. Juan has suspicions that he is being conned by Marcos as he is asking for exactly the amount that Juan has saved up; but Juan reluctantly agrees as the $50,000 is not enough to help his father. They buy the real stamps and go to Gandolfo's hotel, but he says he's changed his mind and will now only buy the stamps if he also gets to sleep with Marcos' sister Valeria (Leticia Br\u00e9dice), who works at the hotel. Valeria's price is that Marcos must confess to their younger brother Federico (Tom\u00e1s Fonzi) how Marcos cheated him out of their family inheritance in Italy. Gandolfo pays for the stamps with a certified check, but the bank crashes the next morning, making the check worthless. Juan and Marcos are both ruined. Juan meets with the motorcycle thieves in a warehouse, they are revealed to be Gandolfo, Sandler and his sister Berta, and Juan's fianc\u00e9e Valeria (Leticia Br\u00e9dice). The real con was to swindle Marcos out of $200,000 as revenge for all the times he cheated his family and his partners. Pauls and Dar\u00edn do give good performances as the two con artists, it seems like a simple job to make money out of counterfeit stamps, but obviously there is more to it than that, to completely honest I couldn't follow it all properly, or maybe I didn't pay the fullest attention, but the Argentina locations are good to see, and it was sort of interesting, an alright crime drama.

            "content": "Juan is a small time con artist who goes into a garage to pull the old \"change\" con of confusing the teller. He is caught doing it by security but is taken from the store by an off duty cop. Luckily the \"off duty cop\" is Marcos, also a con artist who spotted Juan working the store and decided to help him out of trouble and offer him a deal. Marcos' partner has gone missing and his cons need two people to work, so he offers Juan the chance to join him and also see it as a learning experience. Very quickly they settle into one another and they stay together when a chance falls in their lap to pull a job involving a priceless set of stamps called the Nine Queens.Con artist films are all the rage in the past few years and in some ways they always have been \u0096 I'm not sure if it is the cool calm that they are given in films but they seem to have an universal appeal. I didn't know that this film was about that when I came to watch it but it was interesting enough to make me watch it (funnily enough, just after an episode of The Simpsons where Homer and Bart become grifters). From the start of the film, there is a good pace to it that soon builds to the actual plot being revealed. At this point it slows down a bit and requires more detail that the brisk introduction to characters and the game; this kind of is where the problems start to come in. See, here's the thing with this genre \u0096 it needs to grip or at least engage/entertain you because if it doesn't then it gives you time to look around for the con. With Nine Queens, I wasn't held by the detail and found it a bit hard work at times and this allowed me to distract myself with the side issues of where it was going \u0096 we all know it is not what it seems, so we try to see it coming and work it out. This is always going to happen but the film should minimise it by not freeing us up to do this \u0096 hence a lot of the genre are fun, free-flowing, cool and twisty.Here the film is entertaining in its own way but doesn't have the staying power or genre value to make it work. The plot is OK but nothing special and it doesn't glide so much as plod at times. The mind wanders to the possible sting that always comes and, by the time it has come I had spent so much time thinking about it that the obvious and downbeat denouncement is rather flat. The use of the Argentinean economy as a backdrop is interesting but it isn't used as an allegory or use to provide insight or comment as some reviewers here have suggested; it is simply there and what connection there is is merely superficial. I don't want to come across too hard on the film because it does OK and I enjoyed it reasonably well but it doesn't compete with many slicker and more enjoyable entries into the genre and just because it has connections to society and has subtitles doesn't make it a deep meaningful experience \u0096 it is still a genre film, and only an OK one at that.The cast are pretty good all round, although they are mostly weakened by the material. Pauls is engagingly soft and sadly the genre spoils his work because we know he cannot just be this. Darin is better because he goes through so many emotions but yet we never know when he is conning us or when he isn't. Bredice only has a few scenes but she is good with what little she has. Outside of these three, the support cast is too busy and relies on a lot of names moving in and out \u0096 it clutters the plot, slowing it down a bit and allowing us to wander \u0096 falling down in the process.Overall this is a genre film and it is only an OK one at that. The plot gets a bit heavy at times and it allows us to think around it rather than being part of it and really into it and it loses a lot of impact. The best of the genre keep us busy looking one way, or entertaining us or never letting us try to work it out (or even just making us think there is nothing to work out) but here we are never in doubt that the twists are coming. The backdrop of the economy is a vague connection but to read more than that into it requires a lot of forgiving and reading that it never made me willing to do. Not terrible by any means but it doesn't do what the genre normally does and sadly doesn't have much of its own to fill this gap with. Genre fans will get some good out of it and viewers will still find it passable but there are better out there than this.",

And do not expect great cinema here. There is some criticism of Argentinian society sipping through: everybody tries to swindle each other, the bank plays a major part in it all. This was made with the banking crisis still fresh.Matchstick Men was made some years later, but is far superior in direction and made the audience an interactive part of the trickery.

With con artists, nothing is what it seems.The film took me for a fun ride, but ultimately it left me empty. I got no meaning from the movie, only what I came into it with, to wit: With con artists, nothing is what it seems.This is not a detective story, but the equivalent of a very well executed visual adaptation of those pick-a-path books some of us used to read as children. These books all had multiple endings and, based on the choices you make as you went along, the story ended in a particular, albeit somewhat random way.There are many ways that this movie could have ended, and the final scenes concretize only what the filmmakers wanted us to see - but it could easily have been any of the possible endings at all. Since we are viewing a movie about con artists the ending only relies on the filmmakers ability to execute their chosen ending in a believable way. Sadly they fell a little short in my opinion.While I enjoyed the movie, the impossibility of knowing how much to accept of what I saw did spoil it, though it did keep me thinking. This is a movie and not real life, and the situations are not reliably portrayed as they would occur in real life, so teach us nothing.However, for the thinkers among you, you can be satisfied in knowing that it's still possible to put together an entertaining, engrossing admirable film without needing big actors, special effects, name-brand scores, hundreds of millions of dollars, the English language, or the United States. It is unfortunate, then, that the theme is based on deception, and we as viewers have no solid ground to observe the realities of the film until it grinds to it's unexpected but ultimately meaningless end.I would like to see the writing and production team that created this movie deliver a detective story or a comedy, it would certainly be something I would buy and put on my shelf.It gets 7 stars from me. I wish I could give it 7.5 - for hitting the mark three out of four times.",

            "content": "\"Nueve Reinas\" is a typical story of two con artists, one being older and more experienced, and the other learning from him. One of the two characters not having a conscience and being completely corrupt is also a common thing to see in this type of movie. In that sense, what we see in \"Nueve Reinas\" is nothing new for the genre. However, the thing that transforms this movie from something fun and forgettable into something different and memorable is the social aspect which reveals the economic situation and the crisis in Argentina.Juan is a young swindler who is trying to get some money to get his father out of jail. He makes a mistake while performing one of his tricks and he is helped by Marcos, who turns out to be in the same line of work. They decide to work together for one day only. Unexpectedly, they are given a chance to earn millions in this one day of work. All they have to do is to sell a fake stamp collection to a Spanish millionaire. Trying to do that, they get themselves in a bunch of situations that could cost them the money.Although this is a pretty fast and intense movie, it also covers more serious themes like the family. A part of the story is the relationship between Marcos and his sister, who are fighting over a property they inherited. It represents the idea that some people would do anything for money, and go as far as to sacrificing their family to get to it. Ideas like this one appear quite a lot in the movie and turn the story into a much more complex one, not just because of the twists in the plot, but also because of the emotions that they produce.Visually, \"Nueve Reinas\" is modern and simple, which works well with all the action. The actors, especially Ricardo Dar\u00edn as Marcos, play their roles perfectly. They are the most important reason, along with an interesting plot, for this movie to be such a success. The American version of it, \"Criminal\" shows clearly that the story, although interesting, is not enough in itself. When we contrast that movie with \"Nueve Reinas\", it is even clearer to see what an amazing job the Argentine actors did in \"Nueve Reinas\".The biggest problem with the American version was the end of the movie. The most interesting part of Nueve Reinas is the way in which the director includes the story of the \"corralito\" (when people in Argentina could not take their money out of the banks, and watched its value go down until many lost all their savings). This idea of Juan and Marcos losing everything because of the country's economic problems works much better than the last scene used in \"Criminal\" (the check is false). To see all those people who lost all their savings and to understand the magnitude of the event has a much stronger impact on the viewer than just understanding that the whole relationship between Juan and Marcos was just a trick, a job. The irony that, in the end, it does not matter whether the check is real or not, is something that the audience does not forget quickly.",

The film pairs together two con artists who try to score one big take by selling a sheet of rare stamps, The Nine Queens.  Misfortune and complications soon arise as the pair try to carry out their deception.  One crook is in it to enrich his life while the other is trying to get his father out of jail.  Both of them put their personal fortunes on the line in a dicey game of trust. \nIn another sympathetic-thief film (The Italian Job again) the lesson taught here is to be careful who you con and steal from, because one day you're number might just be up.

The con is always aimed at the audience, like a mystery movie with more complexities than simply \"whodunit?, the audience needs to be fooled and then there needs to be pay off where all is revealed, this obviously should not be easy to figure out or otherwise the film wouldn't work. It wouldn't be a proper con film.This brings a problem for writers, as more and more con movies are made and become a distinct style of its own, more and more elaborate and unlikely narrative tricks are needed to hoodwink the audience so in order they will remain guessing the outcome to the end. This is why the genre constantly changes \u0096 magicians seem to be the in thing \u0096 in both content and in form. This is also why to complain about the lack of logic or realism in a con film is similar to complaining about the lack of logic or realism in, say, a fantasy children's book. The genre creates its own logic (which could be said for all genres, if we are being honest.).Therefore this film was a failure, for me, in being a con movie. Or rather its ending failed having too much of a \"David Mamet in Argentina\" feel. It was for me used to such films, Obvious. Though perhaps this was its local appeal \u0096 Obvious in how corrupt and double dealing all the characters are in an Argentine context, a country which has come a by name for political corruption and given its potency to portray in such a (Unique?) way in a local film. Though I admit complete ignorance of Argentine cinema (this was my first ever Argentine film, any recommendations for any others?).That is not to say it isn't good if not earth-shattering or highly original. It is a competent job \u0096 acting, characterization, cinematography, plotting and pacing are all good, and the director made the film flow and didn't focus attention on himself. In this way I recommend it if you are wishing just to spend an hour and a half watching a good, decent movie without expecting anything new, unless you are a virgin to this territory. In which case I recommend it even more; it is pretty much got all the genre staples. I guess \"good, not great\" would sum my feelings. 7/10.",

The con artists (Marcos and Juan) are in a large Spanish city where coning is more than just a game or high-seeking thrill, it is their jobs. Within the city coning seems to be the way of life for the majority, especially when speaking about Marcos and Juan. They become emotionally and physically wrapped up in the business of being con artists that neither friendship nor family is extremely important. What distinguishes Nine Queens as an abnormal con film is the concept of a con within in a con. The concept is hard to grasp until the credits but is very intriguing for the viewer to observe during the process. In Nine Queens the essential motive for social status take a toll on Marcos, especially after the scandal with his family (sister Valeria and younger brother Federico). That status situation for Marcos falls apart at the end, which comes to show that you cant always get what you want and nothing comes without a price. Despite the issues between Marcos and his family, the films plot is exceptional along with the quality. When considering the quality of the film a viewer definitely would notice the specific camera angles in which the scenes were shot and the non-dialectic sound, and know that Bielinksy put a lot of time and effort into this piece of work. Nine Queens most definitely has all the elements for a passion-filled film with excitement thrown in along the way.",

The more experienced of the two, Marco, convinces the younger one, Juan, to stick with him for a day of conning. However it soon becomes clear that Marco needs Juan as much as Juan needs Marco, so beginning a fast paced and thoroughly entertaining ride through the Argentinian underworld. Not being a veteran of Argentian cinema, I couldn't really compare and contrast this movie to whatever else Argentina produces, having stumbled across this one on pay per view. However, the sheer quality of this production just goes to show that it is not only American cinema that can create a great film about deception, which in itself deceives the viewer through a plethora of nifty tricks and twists. The final twist, is also a doozy, so to speak.The film benefits from soldity all around. The acting is completely unprententious, fuss-free and utterly convincing. This also applies to the direction which (at times) borders on the superb through its use of tension building devices. The script is witty and fresh and the use of editing in combination with the swift direction, creates a strong pace even through the most action-free scenes. Relying on dialogue instead of violence or setpieces, excellent characterisation is also achieved confidently.Its familiar territory, sure, but Nine Queens is fresh, fun, non-pretentious and thoroughly gripping film making.",

Some parts made me laugh out loud because the twists were so great it was hard not to admit the unbelieveable wit behind them.However, I was disappointed by the ending (and the final twist) for three reasons: 1) it really p***es me off because it ruins a lot of great scenes that, if Juan set it all up, were in fact pure acting (I mean the characters acting). 2) Juan's culpability is just too \"denied\" by previous scenes, and it's not a good twist if you re-watch the movie and find out how difficult is to buy this set-up, specially because when Juan's alone with Valeria, they don't seem too confident; that's a plot flaw, maybe the only one. 3) it's impossible to make such a con; Juan would have had to run a lot of risks: after all, he couldn't be sure that Marcos would help him in the convenient store, and he sure as hell couldn't have planed in advance going to see Sandler's sister because it was Marco's idea to do so.Despite that only flaw the rest of the movie is a light of hope in the otherwise poor field of argentine cinema.SAY NO MORE.",

The blurb said it was a mix of Amorres Perros and Memento... two of my favourite films of the last few years.I guess they chose Amorres Perros because it was a foreign film, but that's where the comparison finishes, and Memento had absolutely nothing in common with it. Gotta stop believing those quotes, especially when they are taken from Vanity Fair!!All in all it was an average film. Nicely made with some admittedly very good acting. The problem is, it moves so slowly and the story hasn't enough happening to keep you interested. I guessed the ending about two thirds the way through the film, I thought it was pretty obvious. There are some nice smart one liners and the characters are great and it shows you the REAL Argentina. It's just all too lethargically implemented.Some of my favourite movies of the last few years have come from South America but I have a feeling that too many people are jumping on the idea that it's South American film and therefore giving it too much credit. It's an okay movie, great in parts but it doesn't completely work as a whole.",

Buenos Aires inall its tangled splendor and edgy personality is personified in thismovie (although I'm not sure I'd visit it now without having a moneybelt chained to my body!), even the banter and belittling anddiminutives captured the real flavour of an Argentinianconversation.  All throughout the movie you are rooting for the poorbaby faced  Juan as he and his money are separated by thecunning and experienced Marcos (who as the villain, is as likeableas the Sheriff was in \"Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves\") in anelaborately planned scam involved the sale of 9 rare stamps (theNine Queens of the title).  To say more would ruin the surprise;there are even some nicely plotted references to Argentina'scurrent financial crisis which may hit just a little too close to homefor some.  You won't see the travelogue Argentina; in fact it couldhave been filmed in just about any Spanish-speaking city in theentire world and been believable from a set perspective, the realkiller is the staccato dialogue who others have compared toMamet and Tarantino, for the non Argentinian Spanish speakersthe subtitles really don't do it justice.

Unfortunately I found the movie to be uninvolving. I watched it with the same dispassion  as I had when I watched Unbreakable, The Game, Jacob's Ladder, and The Spanish Prisoner. Nine Queens like all those other is about plot twists not about characters. These movies are about misleading the audience not about telling a story.  It becomes a game of wits between the filmmaker and viewer. Can the filmmaker distract the viewer from considering every possible ending before the film finishes. I feel here the filmmaker does not succeed. Sure I thought of that possible ending but disregarded it as not believable. Learning for Jacob's Ladder, I  pick one solution and stick with it. The plot will usually twist around again.SPOILERS ONI have seen \"House of Games\" and \"Spanish Prisoner\", I know how con-artist movies work. The basic premise that everyone you see is in on the con. Doesn't matter if there are 5 people or 50 everyone is in. That rule definitely worked in \"Spanish Prisoner\" and it works here.  I was as suspicious as Juan claimed to be that everything was a con.  I didn't take anyone for face value and was annoyed when one of the characters trusted another. No, it is not as bad as SP, campbell scott in that movie was so gullible, I wanted to scream. Still I was waiting for the point where, like in House of Games,characters had to sacrifice their own money. That took forever!I would have prefer it if Juan told Marco's sister that he could get marco to tell the truth ala get the old woman's bag. That would have been a better payoff and given her a motive to be in on the scheme.SPOILERS OFFI fully admit that my prior viewing ruined nine queens for me but the film makers of Unbreakable, The Game, Jacob's Ladder, and The Spanish Prisoner ruined thrillers for everyone by such cold calculated filmmaking.",

David Mamet wouldn't have anything to say against this film, in fact, it could have easily been conceived by him.

Inside, he notices another man, whom he tries to avoid, as he crouches to check some cans.

I think they changed from an otherwise flawless plot to wit...... 1. In the original ending, Vidal was the one who was sold either real or fake stamps and had to pay by cashier's check due to the difficulty of arranging large amounts of cash in a single day. So Vidal was not in on it, but in fact the source of a lot more than Marcos's $200,000. I can get along with the notion of having to pay with a bank check and also that both Juan and Marcos probably keep all their assets in easily accessible cash, explaining how the sale could go ahead in a day. Sandler's sister was not in on it either -- and her scene was great either way. 2. That they probably had an ending in which both Juan and Marcos were planning to con each other out of the entire amount, but before receiving the cash, the bank had failed, thereby leaving them both in an unhappy ending that nevertheless had a twist -- that the con was real and successful, but they lost the money due to unforeseen circumstances. The movie allowed me to suspend my disbelief right up to the ending - either one or the other was setting it up, but there remained the possibility that they were both having an extraordinary day and opportunity and just couldn't walk away in spite of all the red flags. But an unhappy ending is usually too somber for the people charged with trying to sell films to handle, so they probably re-wrote or re-shot the final scene, which encompasses almost all of the film's implausibilities, to wit.... + about 10 people seem to be happy to share Marcos's measly $200,000 among themselves, as if this was a con not to make any money, but to \"win one for the team.\" + Valeria is happy to share out most of the money she was suing Marcos for. If she was really appalled about being conned by her own brother out of the inheritance, would she then get involved with several experienced con-artists just to get him to lose her money to them? + Would they have been able in one day to fake a news article about a high-profile guy being deported in a high-profile way the next day? Or are we supposed to believe that someone was able to check into the hotel, impersonating Vidal all the way up to the moment he surrenders to the authorities? No, sorry, I think Vidal was originally a real buyer, not in on the con. I also don't think they originally had that \"polvo\" stuff about Marcos's sister (would you send your sister with the real stamps into his room and wait for your money all night? Not even if it was a legitimate sale and you were totally naive would you or anyone else do that, much less so a cynical con-man.) The movie's got all the stuff you want to enjoy the ride: characters, slang dialog, action, Buenos Aires, right up to that last quarter hour: Cut off that ending, leave most of the supporting actors out of the main con, and put in another 10 min in which each of Juan and Marcos tries a last minute and unsuccessful scam on the other, only to soon find that they'll never cash the check, and you've got the original story. But instead we got a really \"cute\" skin-grafted-on ending where the proper birthright is restored (literally), the \"guy gets the girl\" and viewers get a feel-good distinction between good and evil: the \"good\" con-artists restore cosmic harmony and triumph over the \"evil\" one who has crossed some kind of moral line and brought disrepute to their profession. Another great idea crashes on the rocks of the banal ending.",

Bielinsky delivered an honest story by looking into his own background and making this film mainly for the argentine audience. It reminds me to my all-time favorite argentine movie \"Esperando la Carroza\" in the way local color is used to make the picture believable and familiar to us, even if they are such different films. The story is tight with no plot holes and the casting is outstanding with great acting, but what I liked the most was the special care that was put on dialogue. It helps the characters build and develope as the film goes by, which makes such a big difference comparing to the soap-opera dialogue we are used to in argentine films (e.g. Federico Lupi\u00b4s usual coursing \"LA PUTA MADRE QUE TE PARI\u00d3\" every time his script writers want to tell us that he is mad at someone). For those who still believe in argentine cinema I recommend this one as well as \"El Padre de la Novia\".",

            "content": "If you are a fan of hustle/con films and TV shows (Hustle,Leverage,The Sting,Oceans Trilogy etc.) then this is perfect for you. The film starts with a small time grifter scamming a woman who's working the till in a convenience store. The trouble starts however when he tries to do it again on the woman who's working the next shift. When hes caught, an experienced con-man (who is quickly shown as being more willing to risk it) saves him from being handed to the police. And just like that a partnership is formed, things are going well and when a once in a lifetime opportunity seemingly falls into their laps they are quick to take up the offer to make thousands. All they have to do is take some fake stamps and sell them to a collector and he wont have time to check them properly so - its easy money. However everything starts going wrong for them and they find themselves facing the prospect of spending more to make less. Well paced suspense and drama leads to the killer ending where everything is turned upside down with the final twist.Cinema has always been well-suited to con-artist movies, perhaps because the medium itself is based on illusion, deception, and directorial sleight of hand. But Nine Queens (a huge hit in its native Argentina) excels itself and secures itself a spot next to the classics such as the sting and house of games.The films twists and turns never leave the viewer fully aware of whats going on but one things for sure nothing and nobody is quite what they seem.",

            "content": "The story unfolds quickly and gains the involvement of the viewer from the first scene. Then the very credible acting of Pauls and Darin increases the expectations at every moment, making one wonder how their plans will result. Both are con artists, but of very different level. Darin's character is the one with higher ambition and more sophisticated methods, but is also the one whose life seems to be on the verge of total disaster. The tension derived from his messy life and desperate situation, makes him a candidate for any audacity. On the other hand, his just met partner (almost an apprentice), is tempted by the plan crafted by his more experienced colleague, but is always watching out not to be cheated himself. Distrust among the thieves is what mainly makes the movie so good. The end won't disappoint the viewer at all.",

However.I (as well as the rest of my friends and so on) watched this first in a Spanish class. Of course, not typically very exciting. BUT! After a few periods we started getting really into it- we'd want SO much to see the movie. In the hallways we'd try to figure out what would happen from morning classes. When one class saw the end, the message that suddenly exploded was \"OH MY GOD THE ENDING IS SO COOL\"I agree- its very cool. The thing is, though, to really enjoy the movie, you can't think about it and try to figure things out. In my opinion, I like Oceans Eleven a whole lot, but this was about 10 times better.",
